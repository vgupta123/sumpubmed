BACKGROUND
the issue of modularity in genetic constructs has been present in the microbiological literature since the onset of recombinant dna  <cit> . despite various attempts to format vector structure and nomenclature  <cit> , there is not yet any generally accepted standard for plasmid architecture or physical assembly of cloned dna sequences. this state of affairs is rapidly becoming a bottleneck as we move from handling just a few genes in typical laboratory organisms into analysing and massively refactoring the genomes of very diverse bacteria. the notion of formatted genetic tools for the analysis and stable engineering of microorganisms was pursued in the early 90s  with the design of the so-called mini-transposon vectors  <cit> . these allowed stable insertions of foreign dna into the chromosome of virtually any gram-negative target. tn5-derived constructs presented a large number of advantages over their plasmid-based counterparts for introduction of transgenes into many types of bacteria  <cit> . these included maintenance without antibiotic selection, long-term stability and re-usability for generating multiple insertions in the same cells, with no apparent size limits. yet, the original design of such mini-transposons  <cit>  was plagued with problems, such as the inheritance of long, non-functional dna fragments carried along by the intricate cloning-and-pasting dna methods of the time. these were also afflicted by the excessive and inconvenient number of non-useful restriction sites scattered along the vectors, and the suboptimal transposition machinery encoded in them. despite downsides, the mini-transposon-bearing put plasmid series  <cit>  are still to this day one of the most popular vector platforms for analysis and engineering of gram-negative bacteria. in fact, every successful feature of the classical mini-tn5s and its delivery system is originated in mobile elements , which are naturally evolved to thrive in a large variety of hosts. in particular, the tn <dig> transposition system requires exclusively the transposase encoded by tnpa, and the terminal ends of the transposon as the substrate. this affords transposition in a fashion virtually independent of the host, thereby qualifying as an orthogonal biological machinery that expands the utility of the vectors to virtually any host  <cit> .

in this work we have exploited the current ease of dna synthesis for a dramatic remake of the original mini-tn <dig> transposon vector concept. in this process, the most attractive features have been enhanced while each of the drawbacks  has been eliminated. to this end, we have revisited the functional modules that shape the vector and have edited the corresponding dna sequences to minimize them, improve their functionality and make them entirely modular and exchangeable. the final product was the entirely synthetic construct that we have named pbam <dig> , which multiplies the benefits of the earlier designs. we show below that this genetic tool is most advantageous not only for random mutagenesis studies on a target bacterium such as pseudomonas putida, but also for implantation of functional cargos into its genome, be they one  transgene, a transcriptional reporter, or a complex genetic or metabolic circuit. the applications are illustrated below in two different contexts. one regards the identification of new functions that influence the regulation of the catabolic σ54-dependent pu promoter of p. putida. the other involves the visualization of the intracellular targeting of highly expressed proteins in individual bacteria by means of random generation of gfp protein fusions.

RESULTS
rationale of the pbam <dig> layout and editing of its functional modules
a map of the pbam <dig> plasmid is shown in figure  <dig>  with an indication of all functional modules assembled in a total of  <dig> bp of synthetic dna. the complete sequence can be retrieved from genbank with the accession number hq <dig>  the serviceable dna segments included in the construct and the implementation of enhanced properties in each of them are separately examined below. they include the plasmid frame , the mini-transposon element and the cargo module.

the first key feature of pbam <dig> is the utilization of the narrow host-range origin of replication of plasmid r6k as the vegetative oriv of the construct for its proliferation. this origin is strictly dependent on the so-called π protein . the oriv and the pir gene of r6k can be separated and made to function in trans  <cit> . this makes replication of any covalently close circular  dna bearing such an oriv entirely dependent on the provision of the p protein, either from a second plasmid or from the chromosome. this feature has been exploited for the development of a number of conditional systems that make replication of a given construct addicted to host strains of e. coli that express the pir gene  <cit> . virtually all of such existing systems carry the r6koriv-containing  <dig> bp fragment from pgp <dig> plasmid  <cit> . this naturally occurring dna sequence is not only longer than necessary for the oriv function, but it also carries an internal hindiii site in the midst of the repeats that are recognized by the replication machinery  <cit> . moreover, this segment in pgp <dig> has flanking ecori and bamhi sequences that prevent the cognate restriction enzymes being used for cloning. for pbam <dig>  the whole oriv region was streamlined to a minimum  and the internal hindiii removed . finally, the termini of the segment were furnished by the infrequent restriction site asci to create the origin of replication module. these changes did not affect any of the properties described for the natural r6koriv sequences  <cit> . pbam <dig> and its derivatives are maintained in the specialized strain e. coli cc118λpir, which expresses the π protein from a lysogenic phage  <cit> .

the next module of the plasmid frame was the sequence that contains the origin of transfer orit  and enables transfer of pbam <dig> from the host strain to a new recipient, when recognized by the conjugative machinery encoded by the broad host range plasmid rk <dig>  also called rp <dig>  <cit> . since the rp4/rk <dig> conjugal transfer system is the most promiscuous of all dna mobilization device known, the presence of orit allows mobilization of pbam <dig> into virtually any gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria  <cit>  and can even be passed into fungi  <cit>  and eukaryotic cells  <cit> , provided that the construct is exposed to the action of the tra proteins of rp <dig>  <cit> . this transfer can be made by either setting up a tri-parental mating mixture with a donor strain  bearing the r6koriv/rp4orit plasmid, a recipient bacterium and helper cells bearing the mob/tra region of rp <dig> cloned in a plasmid which does not replicate in the recipient  <cit> . as an alternative, the donor λpir+ strain may have the tra/mob functions integrated in its chromosome  allowing bi-parental mating  <cit> . other λpir+e. coli donor strains such as e. coli rh <dig>  which have been engineered to facilitate counter-selection, are also eligible to this end  <cit> . the orit region employed in most plasmid vectors designed for mobilization purposes is exceedingly large  and flanked by bamhi sites  <cit> . as before, we trimmed down the orit to the minimum of  <dig> bp required for functionality  <cit> , eradicated one sfii site present within the core orit sequence  and the streamlined module was flanked by the two rare enzyme sites fsei and pshai. note, however, that in some cases the plasmid can just be electroporated into target cells and conjugation may not be necessary, although the efficiency is considerably lower. since the plasmid transferred to the recipient by conjugation or electroporation cannot in any case replicate because of the lack of the p protein, this process is called suicide delivery.

the last module of the plasmid frame of pbam <dig> was the bla gene that encodes a β-lactamase, endowing ap resistance as selective marker. we kept the natural p <dig> promoter of the natural bla gene to control its expression;  <cit>  and maintained the protein sequence of the enzyme that is employed by many other vectors  <cit> , but the codon usage of the gene was optimized for e. coli and potentially conflicting restriction sites removed. furthermore, transcriptional terminators from the trpa gene  and the gene viii from phage fd were placed upstream and downstream of the bla gene, respectively, to avoid transcriptional readthrough from neighbouring sequences. finally, this selection marker module was flanked by swai and pshai sites, as shown in figure  <dig> 

next come the elements engineered in pbam <dig> for causing insertions of cloned dna into the genome of the target strain. these include a segment encoding the transposase gene tnpa lying outside but adjacent to a dna segment flanked by the terminal sequences of tn <dig> . the tn <dig> transposase recognizes both end-sequences and catalyzes the transfer of the mobile module from the donor replicon to the target genome, where it randomly inserts . the configuration in pbam <dig> exploits the fact that the tn5-carried tnpa gene also works well when located outside the mobile element, although it still needs to be in cis in respect to the target sequences of its gene product  <cit> . the sequence of the tn <dig> tnpa gene of pbam <dig> was edited to enhance a number of desirable characteristics. first, instead of the naturally occurring gene, which has evolved to mediate a very low level of transposition, we re-designed tnpa to endow its product with hyperactivity  <cit> . this included an e54k substitution, which increases transposase binding to the terminal oe sequence, a m56a change that blocks the synthesis of the inh protein , and a l372p replacement that enhances tnpa dimerization, thereby improving its activity  <cit> . as before, to eliminate inconvenient restriction sites, the noti sequence indigenous to the is50r part of tn <dig> was removed by a silent substitution g504->c  <cit> . in addition, the tnpa stop codon tga was changed by the more efficient taa termination codon. otherwise, the edited transposase gene was expressed through its natural t <dig> promoter. however, as tnpa expression is downregulated by methylation, the two dam recognition sites  present within this promoter region were changed to 5'-aatc-gatg-3' as described  <cit> . the sum of all these operations yielded an optimized transposase variant carried by a  <dig> bp segment flanked by pmei and swai sites.

all the features were assembled for the only purpose of assisting the performance of the functional module of pbam1: the mini-transposon segment, the boundaries of which are its two terminal end-sequences . composite transposons like tn <dig> have two full insertion sequence  elements at their termini; both of is sequences are similar but not identical bracketed by 19-bp ess known as inside  and outside  end, which are specifically bound by the transposase  <cit> . in its natural context, tnpa can bind the oe and ie of is50s and promote transposition of only one insertion sequence. alternatively, the same protein can bind the outer oes of the whole transposon and provoke transposition of the entire tn <dig>  <cit> . instead of such natural arrangement, we flanked the mini-transposon part of pbam <dig> with the optimized and hyperactive 19-bp mosaic sequence  previously characterized  <cit> . these were designated me-i and me-o to determine the orientation within the plasmid frame, but are identical in sequence. note that the external borders of both mes were endowed with unique pvuii restriction sites , thereby allowing the excision of the mini-transposon as a linear, blunt-ended dna which can be combined with a purified transposase to form a transposome for its in vivo  <cit>  or in vitro  <cit>  delivery to a target dna.

although a large number of useful sequences can be placed between me-i and me-o, the mini-transposon carried by pbam <dig> carries a km resistance gene  from tn <dig> as a default selection marker, as well as what we call a cargo site containing a polylinker for general cloning purposes. as before, the natural neo sequence  is however repeated at both ends of the polylinker, because its internal deletion reconstructs a short noti-sfii sequence that makes it compatible with earlier versions of mini-transposons  <cit> . in contrast to these, however, the cloning sites of the polylinker are unique in pbam <dig>  making unnecessary the two-step cloning protocols that afflicted the former chromosomal insertion strategies  <cit> . the final assembly thus has the start codon of the neo gene  <dig> bp downstream of the me-i, while the stop codon is  <dig> bp downstream of the me-o, the total length of the optimized element becoming  <dig> bp .

the modular layout of the functional segments of pbam <dig> allows the replacement of each of them by equivalent counterparts, leaving intact the others. we thus argue that the rare sites that punctuate the structure of the vector  provide a useful standard for physical assembly of equivalent systems with other origins of replication, other transposable systems e.g. mariner  <cit> , tn <dig>  <cit> , and other selection markers. once the study of each module was made along the lines mentioned above and the sequences edited in silico, the whole was assembled to produce a unique sequence of  <dig> bp that was chemically synthesized.

validation of pbam1
to assess the functionality and versatility of the new synthetic vector we passed it through several experimental tests to check that the plasmid and the new minimized standard features worked as expected. first we verified that the construct was stably propagated in e. coli cc118λpir, as a medium-to-high copy number plasmid . this confirmed that the editing of the hindiii site in one of the repeats of r6koriv previously believed to be critical for replication  <cit>  was tolerated by the plasmid without any detrimental effect. we next tested two different methods for suicide delivery of the plasmid into a recipient strain , which is a good representative of the non-enteric gram-negative bacteria widely used in industrial and environmental microbiology  <cit> . first, we employed a standard tri-parental mating  for verifying the transposition process and determining the optimum period of time required for constructing a saturated transposition insertion library. to this end, the mating mix was allowed to conjugate for  <dig> to  <dig> h on filters laid on lb plates. at the times indicated, the cells on the filters were resuspended and plated onto m9-citrate agar with km for removal of the donors and selection of p. putida clones bearing insertions of the mini-tn <dig> element. as shown in additional file  <dig> , the average frequency of kmr exconjugants ranged from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  × 10- <dig> after one hour of mating, to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  × 10- <dig> at eighteen hours. the number of exconjugants at longer times, although higher, were not considered as they surely reflected the amplification of earlier transposition times through cellular division, instead of new transposition events. in view of the bimodal shape of the time course of figure s <dig>  we picked  <dig> h as the most useful time for maximum conjugation/transposition events with a minimum of growth. the next step was to examine whether exconjugants had undergone authentic transposition events or they resulted from the cointegration of pbam <dig> into the host genome.  <dig> colonies were randomly selected and their sensitivity to the plasmid marker  tested. all  <dig> kmr clones turned out to be sensitive to the β-lactam antibiotic ampicillin , thereby indicating that the insertion of the mini-transposon carried by pbam <dig> had occurred as expected.

in view of the high numbers, we wondered whether pbam <dig> could also be delivered to p. putida cells in a suicide manner through electroporation instead of conjugation. given that the plasmid cannot replicate in the recipient  this method has the potential advantage that every kmr colony developed on the selective plate must come from a unique transposition event and that siblings are then avoided. table  <dig> shows that, despite being less efficient than conjugation, transformation of pbam <dig> did result in a large number of kmr clones, in a dose-dependent fashion with regards to the amount of dna entered in the transformation mixture. as before, all of  <dig> such kmr colonies tested were sensitive to ap, as they resulted from bona fide transpositions, rather than co-integration of the donor plasmid into the target genome.

a the pbam <dig> plasmid was introduced into recipient cells either by five-hour tri-parental mating or by electroporation, letting the cells to recover after the electro-pulse in lb at 30°c for one hour. electroporation figures are the average of the frequencies obtained using  <dig> ng  and  <dig> ng  of plasmid dna.

c total number of cells that acquired the mini-transposon, as measured by growth in kanamycin normalized to the total  <dig> ×  <dig> donor cells. the  <dig> h mating frequency was averaged using a total of  <dig> independent experiments. electroporation was referred to a final cell concentration of  <dig> ×  <dig> electrocompetent cells and the frequency determined with  <dig> independent experiments.

d number of independent colonies that were screened for the presence of the mini-transposon marker  and for the loss of the plasmid backbone marker .

the next step in the validation involved assessment of the randomness of insertions, the possible occurrence of multiple transposition events in the same cell, and the degree of saturation of each gene with the mobile element. a first answer to these questions was provided by the precise mapping of the boundaries of the mini-tn <dig> insert in one dozen randomly picked kmr colonies coming from either procedure. to this end, we employed the pcr method of das et al  <cit>  with arbitrary primers arb <dig> and arb <dig>  along with a second set of cognate primers that hybridize either end of the mini-transposon . for determining the site of insertion of the transposons we employed in each case primer sets for both ends . figure s <dig>  shows just one example of using this strategy for mapping the mini-tn <dig> insertions at the me-o end with arbitrary pcr. the twenty-four sequences yielded similar results that allowed both to locate insertions within the genome of p. putida and to rule out double or multiple transposition events .  <dig> out of the  <dig> insertions occurred in structural genes scattered through the genome whereas  <dig> of them ended up within intergenic regions. the sequencing of a good number of transpositions of the mini-tn <dig> element born by pbam <dig>  allowed us to examine possible biases of the mobile element for specific sequences. analysis of fifty-five 9-bp of the host genome duplicated after mini-tn <dig> insertion  <cit>  revealed that this was not the case  and that insertion of the synthetic mini-transposon was virtually random.

to obtain a more accurate measurement of the frequencies and diversity of insertions, we employed a strategy that relied on the appearance of a known visual phenotype. for this, we used a derivative of p. putida kt <dig> strain called p. putida mad <dig>  which bears in its chromosome an m-xylene responsive pu-lacz transcriptional fusion that is activated by the σ54-dependent protein xylr, which is encoded also in its genome  the pu promoter has a very low basal expression level but becomes strongly activated when p. putida mad <dig> is exposed to m-xylene and yields blue colonies. the loss of any of  <dig> genetic elements of the strain  can thus yield white colonies on a background of blue clones when exposed to m-xylene vapours. the incidence of insertions in each of the genes can accordingly provide a good estimation of the global transposition frequency. to tackle this question, p. putida mad <dig> strain was mutagenized by tri-parental mating, plated on a minimal m <dig> citrate-km medium supplemented with xgal, and the kmr colonies subject to saturating m-xylene vapors.  <dig> out of the thereby grown ~ <dig>  clones turned out to be unequivocally white. these were picked and submitted to the same chromosomal sequencing of the site of insertion as before. their analysis showed  that  <dig> mutants had mini-tn <dig> inserted throughout the lacz gene, whereas  <dig> of them occurred in xylr. since we found  <dig> different insertions and the length of dna whose interruption gave the white colony phenotype was about  <dig> kb, the transposition appeared to occur at gross frequency of ~ <dig> insertions/kb i.e. equivalent to a  <dig> x coverage of the entire genome . this is surely an underestimation, because the selection procedure on minimal medium avoids the growth of auxotrophic mutants. this is surely the reason why we did not get any insertion in the rpon gene, because such mutants grow poorly in the absence of glutamine  <cit>  and thus fail to form sizable colonies in the minimal medium employed for selection .

exploration of the regulatory landscape of the catabolic pu promoter of p. putida
the σ54-dependent pu promoter employed above is the principal regulatory element at play in the regulation of a complex system for biodegradation of m-xylene in strain p. putida mt- <dig>  <cit> . p. putida mad <dig> strain keeps the essential components of the m-xylene sensor system, fused to a lacz reporter. the high performance of pbam <dig> just described was thus exploited to survey the genome of p. putida for genes which could influence -not abolish- lacz output in the hope of identifying novel functions which may well shed some light on the physiological regulation of the pu promoter  <cit> . to this end, the collection of ~ <dig>  kmr colonies derived from p. putida mad <dig> plated on m9-citrate with kanamycin and exposed to m-xylene was examined for the appearance of paler blue tones or unusual patterns of xgal in the otherwise dark blue of the control colonies that peak at the colony centre. seven of these  were chosen for further analysis. the sequence of the corresponding sites of insertion revealed at least two types of genes that influenced the outcome of the pu-lacz reporter. one group is constituted by an insertion in dnaj, which appears to downregulate pu . dnaj is a heat-shock protein that stimulates the atpase activity of dnak  <cit>  and is perhaps involved in the pathway for proper folding of σ <dig> . a similar xgal distribution pattern is observed when the pp <dig> gene is disrupted . yet, the most unusual phenotype of the pu-lacz fusion carried by p. putida mad <dig> appeared in an insertion within the intergenic region between csta, a gene, which encodes a carbon-stress response protein  <cit> , and pp <dig>  a type iv pilus assembly gene. in these cases , the colonies displayed a double-ring distribution of the dye that suggested an influence of either or both of these proteins in adjusting the physiological control of pu activity  <cit> . other interesting phenotypes were produced by mutations in cysd and cysnc genes, the loss of which produce small, slow-growing colonies with a distinct fisheye distribution of xgal. these mutations are expected to bring about a general deficiency of cysteine  <cit> , which could directly or indirectly affect transcriptional activity . needless to say, these are preliminary observations that require further examination . in the meantime, these results illustrate the power of the genetic tool employed for tackling regulatory phenomena.

survey and localization of highly-expressed proteins in pseudomonas putida
although the literature reports many systems for generating fluorescent fusion proteins  <cit>  we exploited the layout of the pbam <dig> plasmid for constructing a variant able to produce in vivo random insertions of the gfp sequence in chromosomal genes. we reasoned that if a promoterless and leaderless gfp inserts in a gene in the right orientation and in the correct frame we should be able to detect green colonies when insertion occurs either in non essential genes expressed at very high rates or in their permissive termini . to explore this notion, we constructed a pbam <dig> derivative in which the pvuii insert  was replaced by a synthetic dna with a number of new features. first, the new transposon had the me-i sequence adjacent to the second codon of a gfp variant which is optimized for prokaryotic gene fusions  <cit>  and edited to eliminate a native pvuii site, located at position 41- <dig> bp from the 3' end of the gene . in-frame insertions-to-be therefore keep the 5'-end of the truncated gene followed by a  <dig> amino acid linker resulting from translation of the me-i mini-transposon end, and completed by the gfp gene. such insertions thus generate hybrid proteins rather than transcriptional fusions, in a way that makes fluorescence to report net gene expression, not only production of mrna. the second feature of the transposon was the positioning of the kmr cassette  downstream of the gfp gene, but keeping its own promoter. this ensured that selection for resistance to this antibiotic was independent of orientation and read-through transcription from inserted genes. the thereby refactored pbam <dig> derivative was named pbam1-gfp . with this plasmid in hand, we mutagenized p. putida kt <dig> with the tri-parental mating procedure described above, obtaining the same frequencies than those reported above for pbam <dig>  exconjugant clones were allowed to grow to a sizable dimension and inspected for the occurrence of green fluorescent colonies by illuminating the plates with blue light. the frequency of appearance of such strong green fluorescent colonies was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  × 10- <dig>

a total  <dig> clones were picked for further analyses. the sites of insertion were sequenced as before , using arb6/gfp-extr primers in the first pcr round and arb2/gfp-intr in the second one, then sequenced with primer gfp-intr .  <dig> insertions were located in different genes. three independent transpositions were located in the essential gene rplm, two of which were identical, whereas the third one mapped in another position within the gene. finally, two different transpositions were found both in gene pp <dig> and flic . a good share of the gfp fusions were located in genes anticipated to be highly expressed . interestingly, such proteins are believed to be essential, indicating that the gfp fusion had occurred in permissive sites that did not affect their functionality. but apart from ribosomal protein genes, we found highly fluorescent insertions in functionally diverse genes . these included transcription factors, cell envelope-related proteins and hypothetical proteins of unknown functions. the location of fluorescent signals in single cells was then investigated in each case by fluorescence microscopy, the most informative results being shown in fig  <dig>  in most cases, green signals appeared to be somehow localized in specific cell sites or compartments. this was not altogether surprising for proteins known or predicted to be associated with the membrane. cyod::gfp was clearly bound to the cell contour , as would be expected of a protein that forms part of the membrane-bound respiratory chain  <cit> . lapa::gfp originates in a large loosely surface-associated protein that is exported through an abc transporter system  <cit> . that fluorescence appears in this case in regularly spaced foci along the longitudinal cell axis suggests the dots to be the sites of export to the extracellular medium. yet, the most unusual appearance was that of the pp1794::gfp fusion. this orf encodes a protein predicted to have a putative outer membrane location. the hybrid product resulting from its fusion to gfp was near entirely confined to the cell poles and displayed a clear-cut boundary with the rest of the cell, an unprecedented behaviour that will be the subject of future studies. apart of such envelope-related proteins we also found a non-homogenous distribution of gfp in fusions to ribosomal proteins . we believe that these high-fluorescent sites can be related to the so-called translation factories that seem to gather most of the ribosomal machinery of individual cells  <cit> . more unexpected was the high signal brought about by the nusa::gfp fusion. in e. coli, this protein is a transcription termination/anti-termination factor that acts either way depending on its association to other cellular proteins  <cit> . while its high level of expression in p. putida was unexpected, its uneven distribution in single cell probably reflected also the occurrence of transcription factories  <cit>  in this bacterium. finally, one flic::gfp fusion was found to give an uniform gfp signal throughout individual cells. the flagellin protein flic is the main structural component of the flagella  <cit> . that flic::gfp cells lacked any swimming motility  indicated that the function had been knocked-out. it is hence likely that the flic::gfp cannot enter the secretion pathway and it freely diffuses in the cytoplasm as a result. however, the flgm::gfp fusion also originated evenly fluorescent cells , but in this case the transposition did not affect its function since this strain was still motile .

as discussed before, the selection conditions for the mutagenesis experiment just mentioned were such that they ruled out inactivation of essential and metabolic genes necessary for growth in minimal medium. also, gfp fusions may conceal the original localization of the inserted protein . however, random generation of fluorescent fusions of the sort discussed above pinpoints proteins that are highly expressed under physiologically relevant conditions. we argue that this may become a phenomenal tool to tackle the still standing question of gene expression sites vs. chromosomal localization  <cit> , an important issue that is beyond the scope of this paper.

CONCLUSIONS
we have created a synthetic plasmid composed of multiple formatted and optimized functional parts that behave as predicted -both individually and as an integrated system. to the best of our knowledge this is the first report since the early 90s that describes a fully edited genetic tool optimized and streamlined for its final applications -rather than relying on cutting and pasting naturally occurring sequences  <cit> . in a nutshell, non-functional dna sequences were trimmed-off, common restriction sites present outside the multiple cloning site inside the mobile element were eliminated and the plasmid was designed following a modular pattern in which each business sequence was flanked by non-frequent restriction sites. in this respect, the key features of pbam <dig> include not only the removal of many bottlenecks that flawed utilization of many of its predecessors, but also the incorporation of a fixed standard for physical assembly and exchange, where required, of new dna pieces while maintaining its overall layout. the modularity of the design and the origin of the parts in mobile elements, which are endowed with considerable orthogonality, enable pbam <dig> for two specific applications. the first, straightforward application is the use of pbam <dig> as a high-throughput mutational analysis tool  <cit> . second, more important, the new vector allows exploitation of the cargo site  for placing a whole collection of extra genetic gadgets for expression of heterologous genes, reporter systems and environmental markers at user's will. this includes the possibility of cloning large dna fragments inside the mobile element for a final implantation of new traits into the chromosome of the target strain. given the randomness and the high frequencies of such insertions, one can then select the insertion out of a large collection, which adjusts expression of the desired feature to the right level under the required operation conditions  <cit> . furthermore, the ease of replacement of the antibiotic resistance marker  allows the same transposition/delivery system to be reused for subsequent insertions. in sum, this work shows the value of dna synthesis and standardization of functional modules for combining in a single genetic tool many valuable properties that are otherwise scattered in various vectors and rendered useless for the lack of fixed assembly formats. we anticipate pbam <dig> to become one frame of reference for the construction of a large number of vectors aimed at deployment of heavily engineered genetic and metabolic circuits.
