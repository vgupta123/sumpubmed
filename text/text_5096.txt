BACKGROUND
the unfolded protein response  is an intracellular signaling pathway that provides homeostatic feedback regulation between the endoplasmic reticulum  and the gene expression program in the nucleus. to this end, the upr senses the conditions inside the er, detecting an imbalance between newly synthesized protein influx and the protein-folding capacity in the er lumen, and activates a corrective response. when activated, the upr drives a broad transcriptional program that adjusts the abundance of the er  <cit> .

the primary signal transduction device in the upr is an er membrane-resident sensor of misfolded proteins, ire <dig>  ire <dig> is conserved from yeast to mammalian cells  <cit> . according to one model, unfolded proteins act as ligands that bind directly to the ire <dig> luminal domain  <cit> . another model posits an indirect mode of activation in which the er-luminal chaperone bip plays a central role  <cit> . both views converge on the concept that oligomerization of the ire1-luminal domain is crucial for signal propagation across the membrane. oligomerization of ire1's luminal domains leads to a local increase in the concentration of ire1's cytoplasmic kinase and rnase domains, which are tethered to the er-luminal domain through a transmembrane segment. recent structural insights suggest that oligomerization activates the cytoplasmic modules by their cooperative assembly into an ordered oligomer  <cit> . the kinase domains undergo trans-autophosphorylation, which installs phosphate-mediated salt bridges between adjacent ire <dig> monomers to stabilize the oligomer. the resulting juxtaposition of ire1's rnase domains assembles and stabilizes the rnase active site  <cit> . ire <dig> then initiates the unconventional splicing of hac <dig>  or xbp <dig>  mrna by cleaving either mrna at two conserved sites to excise an intron  <cit> . transfer rna ligase completes the mrna splicing reaction in yeast  <cit> , and an as yet unknown enzyme ligates the exons in metazoans. intron removal allows the production of the upr transcription activators hac <dig> and xbp <dig>  respectively. the transcription factors upregulate upr target genes, closing a feedback loop that adjusts the er's protein-folding capacity according to need.

the kinase domain of ire <dig> is structurally and biochemically similar to that of other protein kinases, including csrc  <cit> , epidermal growth factor receptor   <cit> , pkr  <cit> , gcn <dig>  <cit> , cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig>   <cit> , aurora  <cit> , camp  <cit>  and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase  <dig>  <cit>  . notably, binding of nucleotides and synthetic ligands to the kinase domain of ire <dig> allosterically activates the ire <dig> rnase  <cit> . ire1's rnase activity provides a built-in reporter of kinase conformation, establishing ire <dig> as a unique model in which conformational properties of a kinase can be studied separately from the phosphoryl transfer step by using a sensitive and quantitative enzymatic readout.

adp serves as a cofactor  <cit>  which stimulates rnase activity of saccharomyces cerevisiae ire <dig> in vitro by approximately 200-fold  <cit> . it has been proposed that adp and other atp pocket ligands stabilize ire <dig> in a conformation that forms oligomers  <cit> . as protein kinases related to ire <dig> can assume two globally different conformational states, commonly referred to as "inactive" and "active"  <cit> , ire <dig> monomers were thought to exist in an inactive conformation and cofactors were thought to stabilize the active conformation via occupancy of the atp pocket  <cit> . this simple model, however, cannot explain the paradoxical observation that adp has been reported to be a better cofactor than the bulkier atp  <cit> . binding of atp to the atp pocket does not fully trigger the rnase-activating conformational change in ire <dig>  arguing against the model that atp pocket occupancy is sufficient to lock ire <dig> into the active conformation and to activate rnase. in the present study, we carried out a quantitative analysis of ire <dig> oligomerization and rnase activation properties with a series of cofactors to resolve this conundrum and to glean insights into the allosteric mechanism by which cofactors control the activity of ire <dig> rnase.

RESULTS
rnase activity quantitatively correlates with ire <dig> oligomerization
we observed previously  <cit>  that ire <dig> rnase is activated upon high-order oligomerization of ire1's kinase/rnase domains . at sufficiently high concentrations, a cytosolic portion of ire <dig>  forms large-scale oligomers that scatter visible light and display high rnase activity  <cit> . ire1kr <dig> contains ire1's cytoplasmic kinase and rnase domains, is autophosphorylated as isolated from the escherichia coli expression host and bears an n-terminal 32-aa extension derived from the linker that connects the ire <dig> kinase and transmembrane domains. this n-terminal extension is important for optimal oligomerization and rnase activity of ire <dig>  <cit> . as ire1kr <dig> oligomerization resulted in cloudy solutions visible to the naked eye, we explored whether sample transparency could be used to evaluate the oligomer formation quantitatively. we found that turbidity of ire1kr <dig> solutions measured as an optical density at  <dig> nm  indeed provides a reliable, quantitative metric of oligomerization .

as a function of enzyme concentration, the od <dig> of ire1kr <dig> solutions increased cooperatively by approximately two orders of magnitude in both the absence and presence of the activating cofactor adp mg . observed hill coefficients  were in close agreement with those determined in an enzymatic assay that monitors ire1's rnase activity  . in the presence of the adp mg cofactor, both od <dig> and rnase profiles shift similarly toward lower ire1kr <dig> concentrations, which, together with similar hill coefficients, indicates that both assays monitor the same physical phenomenon: high-order ire <dig> oligomerization.

as shown in an overlay of the od <dig> and rnase measurements , both assays are indeed superimposable. od <dig> was below the detection limit at ire1kr <dig> concentrations that already displayed activated rnase, indicating that active ire1kr <dig> oligomers at these concentrations are too sparse to result in detectable turbidity. by contrast, od <dig> values continued to rise after rnase activity reached a kinetic plateau due to the onset of a saturating regime k <dig>  as the oligomer concentration exceeded the km for rna binding  <cit> . the rnase and od <dig> readouts therefore complement one another and allow monitoring of the log-linear oligomerization over a broader range of ire <dig> concentrations than either assay in isolation. the rnase activity provides a more sensitive measurement and detects oligomers at concentrations several orders of magnitude smaller than those detectable by od <dig> readings.

recombinantly expressed ire1kr <dig> used in these studies contains approximately  <dig> phosphates  <cit> . we showed previously that removal of these phosphates by mutagenesis of the kinase active site shifted the activation profile to higher ire1kr <dig> concentrations  <cit> . to further verify that the rnase-based readout of oligomerization and the more direct readout based on od <dig> absorbance are in agreement, we measured the concentration dependence of an unphosphorylated variant of ire1kr <dig>  ire1kr <dig>  this double-mutant carries mutations of residues that are required for γ-phosphate coordination and catalysis of phosphotransfer but otherwise do not disrupt nucleotide coordination at the atp pocket. recombinantly expressed ire1kr <dig> is entirely unphosphorylated as established by mass-spectrometry, and phosphotransfer-inactive  <cit> . as shown in figures 1c and 1d, both rnase activity and od <dig> profiles were shifted to higher enzyme concentrations for ire1kr <dig>  note that the data include the characterization of an additional ire <dig> mutant ire1kr <dig>  which also exhibited a consistent shift in both assays and is discussed below.

therefore, both rnase and od <dig> readouts report robustly on cofactor addition  and perturbations due to mutations in ire <dig> . we show below that the equivalency between the optical and enzymatic readouts also extends to all other variables tested, such as chemical substitution in the adp cofactor and addition of thiophilic metal ions in the presence of an adp isostere, adpβs. the data in figure  <dig> therefore indicate that rnase activity and od <dig> provide reliable readouts for ire1kr <dig> oligomerization and support the model  <cit>  in which oligomerization and rnase activation are mechanistically coupled.

activation of ire <dig> rnase by different cofactors
to quantitatively define the potency of different ire <dig> cofactors, we measured the activation of ire1kr <dig> rnase in vitro following the site-specific cleavage of a 32p-labeled rna hairpin substrate. we found that at saturating concentrations, nucleotides amp and atp both activated ire1kr <dig> by approximately tenfold . notably, although the effects at saturation were similar, the apparent affinity for amp was tenfold lower than that observed for atp . by contrast, adp bound with an apparent affinity similar to that of atp, but adp binding resulted in 20-fold stronger activation of the enzyme . among other nucleotides tested, only 2'-deoxy stimulated ire1kr <dig> rnase comparably to adp , although it bound more weakly . the divergence of the apparent cofactor binding constants and maximal stimulation of rnase activity at saturating cofactor concentrations extended to other cofactors . thus, surprisingly, cofactor binding and cofactor-induced conformational changes that promote ire <dig> oligomerization can be experimentally uncoupled. as binding of the larger atp molecule fails to activate ire1kr <dig> to the same extent as does binding of adp, resulting in an order-of-magnitude smaller response , we concluded that mere occupancy of the atp pocket does not effect optimal ire1kr <dig> activation.

to describe different cofactors quantitatively, we defined a "potency of cofactor"   

as the ratio of the kobs of ire <dig> with saturating amounts of cofactor bound over the kobs of apo-ire <dig>  both measured under standard assay conditions, which we defined as  <dig> μmol ire1kr <dig>  at this ire1kr <dig> concentration, maximum fold stimulation by adp was achieved . the relationship between the macroscopic conformational parameter pcof and the microscopic equilibria involved in oligomerization is described in the discussion section and in greater detail in additional file  <dig>  supplementary analysis  <dig> 

when cofactors are compared using the pcof metric, the rnase activity of apo-ire <dig> defines the baseline with pcof =  <dig>  the presence of bound adp stimulates ire1kr <dig> strongly with pcof approximately 200), whereas the presence of bound amp or atp is less effective  . similarly, synthetic small molecules that bind to the nucleotide-binding pocket in ire <dig>  can be described by pcof . sunitinib, an atp-mimicking drug developed as a competitive inhibitor of egfr kinase, activated ire1kr <dig> to a similar extent as amp and atp , whereas apy <dig> and apy <dig> activated ire <dig> as well as or better than adp    <cit> .

a β-phosphate-coordinated metal ion facilitates ire <dig> oligomerization
strikingly, the close adp-mimic adpβs did not activate ire1kr <dig> . this finding was paradoxical because adpβs bound to ire <dig> with the same affinity as adp and atp, as indicated by its apparent ki in a competitive inhibition assay of ire1kr32's adp-stimulated rnase  and by measurements of the small rnase stimulation by adpβs in the absence of adp . thus we conclude that the atp pocket can be occupied by a tightly binding cofactor without activating rnase.

the sulfur substitution in adpβs introduces a "soft" atom, which has a larger covalent radius than that of oxygen. sulfur does not form strong hydrogen bonds and does not coordinate strongly with "hard" cations such as magnesium  <cit> . elegant "metal specificity switch and rescue" experiments that are well established for ribozymes showed that metal ion coordination disrupted as a result of oxygen-sulfur substitutions can sometimes be restored if a softer metal cation such as mn2+ is supplied to the reaction  <cit> . indeed, when we added mn2+ to the assay buffer, we observed complete restoration of adpβs cofactor activity to the level of adp mg .

the rescue was specific for a sulfur-soft metal ion pair because adpβs did not activate ire <dig> by more than a few fold in the presence of mg2+  and because cd2+, another thiophilic metal, also rescued the activity . furthermore, neither mn2+ nor cd2+ stimulated reactions with oxo-adp . these data strongly point to a functional connectivity between the β-phosphate of adp, mg2+ ion coordination and a conformational change in the ire <dig> kinase domain, resulting in activation of ire <dig> rnase.

by contrast, such connectivity was not observed for the γ-phosphate of atp, which also contacts the mg2+ ion in crystal structures of protein kinases. atpγs bound to ire <dig> slightly more weakly than atp , but at saturation it functioned indistinguishably from atp .

as expected, rnase activation by adpβs and mn2+ fully coincided with ire1kr <dig> oligomerization monitored as od <dig>  samples of ire1kr <dig> were transparent in the absence of cofactors or in the presence of adpβs or mn2+ alone. by contrast, white oligomer solutions formed in the presence of adp + mg2+ or adpβs + mn2+ . measuring rnase activity and od <dig> as a function of ire1kr <dig> concentration further confirmed that adpβs-saturated ire1kr <dig> behaved similarly to apo-ire1kr <dig>  upon addition of mn2+, cooperative activation profiles with adpβs became indistinguishable from those obtained with ire1kr <dig> and oxo-adp mg .

because the β-phosphate can rotate around the α-β bridging bond, replacement of one β-oxygen atom by sulfur leaves two more oxygen atoms on the β-phosphate available for coordination of mg2+. the deleterious effect of the oxygen-to-sulfur substitution in adpβs therefore implies that all three nonbridging oxygen atoms on the β-phosphate form functionally important interactions, all of which are required for the conformational change in ire1's kinase domain. thus, every nonbridging oxygen atom must obligatorily either coordinate mg2+ or form hydrogen-bonding contacts to the protein. detrimental effects of the steric bulk introduced by the larger sulfur atom can be disregarded, because adpβs works as well as adp in the presence of mn2+.

in the crystal structure of the ire <dig> adp complex   <cit> , nonbridging oxygen  <dig>  coordinates to mg2+, nonbridging oxygen  <dig> forms a hydrogen bond through conserved lysine k <dig> and nonbridging oxygen  <dig> forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone of strand β <dig> . this network of connectivity is conserved among protein kinases  <cit> , suggesting that lessons learned from the nucleotide effects on ire <dig> may be broadly applicable to other protein kinases.

in ire <dig>  the β-phosphate-coordinating mg2+ ion additionally coordinates to the conserved aspartate d <dig>  which is functionally important for ire <dig> rnase activation . as shown in figure 3h, removal of this interaction via a d828a mutation in ire1kr <dig> results in a loss of ire <dig> responsiveness to adp mg, consistent with the importance of the magnesium coordination demonstrated by the studies of adpβs above. addition of the magnesium-independent cofactor apy <dig>  <cit>  , which replaces the β-phosphate-magnesium moiety with an aromatic ring, partially activated ire1kr <dig> . therefore, the ire1kr <dig> mutant retains the intrinsic ability to become activated by cofactors, and the loss of responsiveness to adp mg2+ arises, at least partially, from the impaired magnesium coordination.

on the basis of the data presented so far, we conclude that the β-phosphate-interactions of adp with ire <dig> kinase form a "β-phosphate latch". this latch involves a centrally positioned mg2+ ion that lies at the core of the molecular switch that controls ire <dig> oligomerization and thereby its rnase activity. for natural adenosine nucleotides, this latch is engaged via a highly specific hydrogen bonding and metal coordination network. for synthetic ligands, such as apy <dig>  the β-phosphate latch is bypassed by metal-independent interactions such as hydrophobic and/or hydrogen-bonding contacts.

the position of the β-phosphate is dynamically linked to the conformation of the kinase domain
equivalently placed cofactor-bound mg2+ ions are found in other protein kinases that are structurally similar to ire <dig>  <cit> , including the closely related and structurally well-characterized cell cycle regulator kinase cdk <dig>  the high structural similarity between cdk <dig> and ire <dig> kinase domains  suggests that insights gained from cdk <dig> may help increase the understanding of ire <dig> function and vice versa. comparisons of aligned structures of cdk <dig> adp mg, cdk <dig> atp mg with and without bound cyclin  and apo-cdk <dig> reveal only a minor displacement  of the position of the adenosine base , yet phosphate atoms of the bound nucleotides move much larger distances. the β-phosphate in particular stands out as the most rearranged part of the nucleotides, occupying one of two positions that are  <dig>  Å apart. as we discuss below, these two states of the nucleotide and the kinase domain are linked to the rearrangement of the αc-helix common to protein kinases and are indicative of switching cdk <dig> between its inactive  and active  conformations   <cit> . the same connection between the β-phosphate position and the kinase conformation could be established for a well-characterized tyrosine kinase csrc that also has been crystallized in several conformations .

two relevant conclusions arise from published crystal structures of protein kinases. first, atp can bind to a kinase domain without noticeably altering its inactive conformation, as judged by the unchanged position of the αc-helix in apo-cdk <dig> and in cdk <dig> atp mg complexes . therefore, in agreement with our studies on ire1kr <dig> and adpβs, conformational changes in the kinase domain do not necessarily occur in response to occupancy of the nucleotide binding pocket. second, transition from the inactive to the active conformation upon the binding of cyclin to cdk <dig> atp results in a pronounced  movement of the αc-helix , demarcating its switch to the active conformation  <cit> , and in an approximately 5-Å movement of the β-phosphate . this global conformational rearrangement positions a conserved glutamate e51cdk <dig> to interact through a salt bridge with the conserved lysine k33cdk <dig>  which docks to the β-phosphate. the docking of the β-phosphate aligns the γ-phosphate in the proper geometry for phosphotransfer  <cit>  .

our experiments demonstrating the rescue of ire1kr <dig> adpβs activity by mn2+ suggest that β-phosphate insertion does not occur merely in response to a conformational change in the kinase domain. instead, it supplies appreciable free energy for stabilizing ire <dig> kinase and, by extension, other related protein kinases in the active conformation with the αc-helix in the "in" orientation.

the movement involving αc-helix is a dynamic feature of many protein kinases  <cit> . important to the work presented here is that the residues for β-phosphate placement in cdk <dig>  are conserved in ire <dig> . to assess experimentally whether the αc-helix in ire <dig> functions in the conformational switch, we probed the predicted salt bridge k702-e <dig> by mutagenesis. because k <dig> is also directly involved in cofactor binding , we judged that the effects of any k <dig> mutations could not be interpreted straightforwardly and therefore focused the mutagenesis on e <dig>  we chose to mutate e <dig> to lysine, creating ire1kr <dig>  to minimize perturbations to space filling, local hydrophobicity and h-bonding capability. the e715k mutation introduces a repulsive electrostatic interaction with k <dig> and is expected to destabilize the αc-helix "in" conformation.

in agreement with this expectation, the ire1kr <dig> mutant displayed a vastly decreased rnase activity  and did not oligomerize at concentrations at which wild-type ire1kr <dig> produced large amounts of oligomers . as the mutational perturbation of αc-helix was expected to affect the phosphotransfer activity of the ire <dig> kinase, it was important to rule out that the oligomerization defect of the ire1kr <dig> mutant and its concomitant loss of rnase activity did not result solely from a loss of phosphorylation. the effect of the loss of phosphorylation could be evaluated readily by comparing ire1kr <dig> with ire1kr <dig>  which would be entirely unphosphorylated. to this end, we used the double-mutant ire1kr <dig>  which has a catalytically inactive kinase domain, purifies with no phosphates attached and retains readily detectable rnase activity  <cit> . at concentrations that allowed ire1kr <dig> to oligomerize nearly to the level of wild-type ire1kr <dig> and to exhibit nearly maximal rnase activity, ire1kr <dig> showed only trace rnase activity and only trace levels of oligomers in the od <dig> readout . these findings confirm that the deleterious effects of the e715k mutation cannot be accounted for even by the complete loss of phosphorylation and therefore support the model that e <dig> controls the conformational properties of ire <dig> 

this model is also supported by the recent crystal structure of unphosphorylated human ire1α, which shows human ire1α in an inactive conformation. in this structure, the β-phosphate latch is disengaged, the activation loop and the αc-helix are in the inactive conformation and the salt bridge k599-e <dig>  is disrupted  <cit> . while formally remaining conjecture, it is very likely that the k599-e <dig> interaction and the β-phosphate insertion also occur in the active conformation of human ire1α, because the active conformations are essentially the same for all protein kinases  <cit> . according to this view, the functional analyses of ire1kr <dig> presented herein support the conformational similarity of ire <dig>  cdk <dig>  csrc, egfr and related protein kinases inferred from their sequence and structural similarity.

crystal structure of an ire1kr <dig> oligomer with an apo-kinase domain
the results presented so far suggest a model in which adp mg locks ire <dig> into the αc-helix "in" conformation, which favors oligomerization and thereby activates rnase. from the principle of coupled equilibria, it follows that oligomerization, if it can be induced without kinase ligand binding, would likewise lock the kinase domain into the active αc-helix "in" conformation. indeed, high concentrations of apo-ire <dig> induce cooperative oligomerization and activation of rnase, illustrating the ability of apo-ire <dig> to oligomerize without cofactors . structural insights into this apo-ire <dig> oligomer, however, have been missing because to date attempts to crystallize the oligomeric ire1kr <dig> in the absence of atp pocket-binding cofactors have not been successful. in the present study, we circumvented this problem by introducing a new ligand, an oligonucleotide bound to the rnase domain, that resulted in diffracting crystals of irekr <dig> in its oligomeric state but with a ligand-free apo kinase domain.

to this end, we used a splice-site mimic oligonucleotide  containing 2'-deoxy substitutions throughout to prevent its degradation by ire <dig>  oligonucleotide-complexed ire1kr <dig> crystallized in space group c <dig> and diffracted to  <dig>  to  <dig>  Å . the asymmetric unit contained seven ire1kr <dig> molecules. the asymmetric units packed to form the same oligomeric structure as in the  <dig> -Å complex previously crystallized with the small-molecule activator apy <dig> in the kinase active site, which crystallized in space group p <dig> and had  <dig> ire1kr <dig> molecules per asymmetric unit  . the oligomers in c <dig> and p <dig> structures pack via a different set of crystallographic contacts , strongly supporting the notion that the ire1kr <dig> oligomer is a stable assembly not resulting from a particular crystal environment. electron density for the bound substrate was observed in the rnase active site . its implications for the catalysis of rna cleavage are discussed in a separate publication  <cit> .

although at  <dig> -Å resolution it is not possible to identify positions of individual side chains, secondary structural elements can be resolved, as evidenced by low-resolution crystal structures of other macromolecules  <cit> , especially if a high-resolution structure can be used for phasing. sevenfold noncrystallographic symmetry averaging greatly enhanced the effective quality of the ire1-oligonucleotide complex density map . a cross-validated sigmaa test  <cit>  showed that useful and statistically significant diffraction spans to approximately  <dig>  Å. the simulated-annealing omit electron density maps, in which the model bias for the αc-helix and the activation loop regions is minimized, demonstrate unambiguously that the αc-helix and the activation loop, the two most dynamic parts of kinases, are in the same position as they were in two previous structures, in which either adp mg or the synthetic activator apy <dig> was bound  . these observations are in agreement with the model that oligomerization of apo-ire1kr <dig> requires the αc-helix to be in the "in" position. on the basis of these findings, it is likely that oligomerization plays the same role in controlling ire <dig> conformation as cyclin binding does in cdk <dig> and dimerization does in egfr  <cit> , such that binding of a protein partner stabilizes the αc-helix in the "in" position, even when the kinase active site is empty.

discussion
protein kinases are dynamic enzymes that couple catalysis to pronounced conformational changes. studies of their dynamics are limited by the intrinsic difficulty of uncoupling enzymatic phosphoryl transfer from conformational properties. in the present study, we exploited the unique facets of ire <dig> biology to overcome this shortcoming. the approach was made possible by ire1's unique property to form easily quantified high-order homo-oligomers upon activation and by ire1's rnase domain, which provides a natural built-in reporter of the kinase domain conformation. conformational changes in ire1's kinase domain modulate the enzyme's predisposition to form oligomers, in which ire1-ire <dig> contacts across multiple interfaces activate ire1's rnase activity.

the propensity of ire <dig> for activation is modulated by three parameters:  its local concentration,  its phosphorylation state and  its interactions with cofactors in the atp binding site of ire1's kinase module. in its physiological setting, the local concentration of the cytoplasmic ire <dig> kinase/rnase module is responsive to the protein-folding conditions inside the er lumen. as unfolded proteins accumulate there, the ire1's luminal domain oligomerizes, thereby concentrating the covalently tethered kinase/rnase domains on the other side of the membrane. this concentration event is thought to provide the primary switch leading to ire <dig> activation. in this view, trans-autophosphorylation would ensue following juxtaposition of the kinase domains. the phosphorylation state of ire <dig> is a dynamic parameter that changes over time and is thought to contribute to a molecular timer. initial phosphorylation events on the activation loop lead to phosphorylated side chains that form stabilizing salt bridges to neighboring ire <dig> molecules in the active oligomer  <cit> , whereas subsequent hyperphosphorylation events appear to promote ire <dig> turnoff, perhaps because of oligomer-destabilizing charge repulsion effects  <cit> .

cofactor binding to the atp pocket of the kinase domain is expected to provide another regulatory input that strongly modulates the sensitivity of the switch to integrate upr signaling with the physiological state in the cell's cytoplasm. in particular, it is intriguing to speculate that upr may be modulated by the adp/ ratio due to the 20-fold higher pcof of adp compared to atp and amp. up to an order of magnitude change in the adp/atp ratio has been reported during glucose starvation in pancreatic β cells and during apoptosis  <cit> . if this were also the case during the upr, an increase in the relative adp level would sensitize ire <dig>  requiring lower concentrations of unfolded proteins to activate the upr. an alternative possibility could be that an unknown stress-induced small-molecule metabolite with high pcof and low kcof, other than nucleotides, could serve biological roles in modulating ire <dig> activity via binding in the atp pocket. work in mammalian systems suggests that ire <dig> can be activated independently of an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the er lumen, perhaps by utilizing such a mechanism to shift the oligomerization activation threshold  <cit> . it has been shown that, in addition to the atp pocket, ire <dig> has a different pocket in the rnase domain and that binding of quercetin to this pocket stimulates ire <dig> rnase  <cit> . this finding opens up a possibility that, in addition to the kinase-binding ligands, ligands binding to the rnase domain of ire <dig> contribute to modulation of ire <dig> signaling.

phosphorylation of ire <dig> considerably affects its responsiveness to cofactors. in the presence of adp, fully phosphorylated ire1kr <dig> exhibits a 40-fold stronger pcof  compared to ire1kr <dig> lacking phosphates  . therefore, phosphorylation not only promotes ire <dig> oligomerization but also "primes" the receptor for sensing atp pocket-binding cofactors. notably, unlike pcof, binding of cofactors to ire <dig> does not appear to depend on ire <dig> phosphorylation, as both ire1kr <dig> and ire1kr <dig> exhibit similar kcof values with adp . the effect of phosphorylation on ire <dig> sensitivity to cofactors has also been observed during the study of the quercetin pocket  <cit> . these observations suggest that modulation of ire <dig> signaling by cofactors may be physiologically most important after the upr has been initiated, amplifying the activity of ire <dig> molecules that have already been phosphorylated.

by measuring the ire <dig> rnase activity in response to kinase-bound small molecules, we resolved two independent steps in cofactor-ire <dig> interactions: cofactor binding and the conformational response to a bound cofactor. noting the wide spectrum of potencies of different cofactors at saturation, pcof, we propose a simple model in which cofactors bound in the atp pocket shift an equilibrium between an inactive and an active conformation of ire <dig> . in the model, the inactive conformation "o" corresponds to that of a free ire <dig> monomer that has the αc-helix in the inactive, "out" position also observed for other protein kinases. the active conformation "i" corresponds to that of ire <dig> oligomers with the αc-helix in the active, "in" position. the conformational equilibrium between the "o" and "i" states depends strongly on the chemical nature of the bound cofactor. whereas some cofactors, such as adpβs, bind without noticeably perturbing this equilibrium, other natural and synthetic cofactors effect an equilibrium shift of over two orders of magnitude. the effect of the cofactors on the oligomerization equilibria  is summarized in the free energy diagram shown in figure 6c. according to our model shown in figure 6c, cofactors lower the free energy of the "monomer i" state , ultimately resulting in an equilibrium shift toward oligomerization .

quantitative manifestations of the two steps, apparent cofactor affinity kcof and cofactor potency pcof, do not correlate , suggesting that they arise from distinct  subsets of molecular interactions. the adp/adpβs comparison  indicates that the kinase hinge-contacting face  <cit>  of the cofactors serves for binding, whereas the k702/e715-contacting face  modulates the kinase conformation and could be exploited for designing potent synthetic ire <dig> activators. our findings show that ire <dig>  as already known for other protein kinases, can exist with the atp pocket filled by cofactors while remaining in the inactive conformation. with certain cofactors such as adpβs, this functional state could dominate in solution, a notion previously unappreciated in studies of ire <dig> 

the macroscopically measured parameters kcof and pcof are composite derivatives of the microscopic constants ,  and . . the kcof value depends largely on  the true microscopic binding constant . the pcof value depends only on  and  and not on the binding constant . therefore, pcof is indeed a quantitative metric of conformational responsiveness to bound cofactor, uncoupled from the cofactor binding step, and describes the apparent pressure pushing the kinase domain toward the active conformation with the αc-helix "in" position. for adp, pcof arises predominantly because of the β-phosphate-magnesium insertion into the kinase domain , which is functionally defined herein using the metal specificity switch approach.

synthetic molecules lacking a β-phosphate equivalent altogether can achieve the same goal in the absence of mg2+ ions by inserting bulky moieties in the β-phosphate position. in agreement with this model, sunitinib , which is predicted to occupy the β-phosphate position only partially  <cit> , has a relatively low pcof  .

in cdk <dig>  productive docking of the atp β-phosphate in the latched position is facilitated by an external effector, cyclin, that stabilizes the αc-helix "in" conformation extrinsically  <cit> . a conceptually similar mechanism is employed by egfr, which dimerizes using one egfr monomer to stabilize another egfr monomer in the αc-helix "in" conformation  <cit> . ire <dig> does not require a cyclin equivalent, but instead uses homo-oligomerization to stabilize the αc-helix "in" conformation.

CONCLUSIONS
we have characterized an allosteric mechanism by which cofactor binding to the atp pocket of the ire <dig> kinase domain activates the receptor's rnase domain. our studies of ire1kr <dig> demonstrate that the k702-e <dig> salt bridge is important for αc-helix positioning and ire <dig> activation. in combination, the structural rearrangements in cdk <dig>  and the presented functional and structural observations with ire <dig> converge on a model in which predisposition toward the active conformation of the kinase domain  is tightly coupled to β-phosphate docking of bound nucleotide . suboptimal β-phosphate docking, as in ire <dig> adpβs, ire <dig> atp mg or cdk <dig> atp mg, does not preclude the nucleotide from binding, but results in the predominantly inactive conformation and, for ire <dig>  a correspondingly low pcof value.

for cdk <dig>  ire <dig>  csrc, egfr and perhaps numerous other protein kinases that use αc-helix movement for conformational control, interactions with bound ligands in the atp pocket may be strongly allosterically coupled to the inactive ↔ active transition and may influence the surface where these kinases bind external effectors. for ire <dig>  cofactors produce an orders of magnitude shift in the oligomer population, demonstrating that ligands can drive protein-protein interactions involving the kinase/rnase module of ire <dig>  analogously, cofactor-mediated conformational tuning of protein kinases related to ire <dig> might be deployed to recruit their binding partners and allow protein kinases and catalytically inactive pseudokinases encoded in metazoan genomes to function as signaling conformational switches independent from atp hydrolysis. the paradoxical in-trans-activation of raf kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase by kinase inhibitors  <cit>  apparently arises from such a mechanism.
