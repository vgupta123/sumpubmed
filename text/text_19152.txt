BACKGROUND
jatropha  is a potential oilseed crop for the production of renewable bioenergy  <cit> . however, jatropha seeds contain toxic and anti-nutritive compounds, which include phorbol esters, curcins, saponins, trypsin inhibitors, protease inhibitors, curcain, jatrophidin, phytates, alkaloids, lectins, lignans, tannins, latex and cyclic peptides  <cit> . the presence of these compounds in jatropha seeds renders the seedcake for being unsuitable for animal feed and raises safety and environment concerns on jatropha plantation and processing  <cit> .

ribosome-inactivating proteins  are found in many plants, fungi and bacteria. they are toxic n-glycosidases that depurinate the universally conserved α-sarcin loop of large rrnas, which inactivates the ribosome, thereby blocking its further participation in protein synthesis  <cit> . curcins in j. curcas belong to type i rips, which are common among the members of the euphobiaceae family. curcin is analogous to ricin, a type ii rip, in ricinus communis. however, the toxicity of curcin is significantly lower than that of ricin  <cit> . the biochemical function of curcin in j. curcas is not well known and several reports suggest that it may play a role in defense against biotic and abiotic stress . besides, curcins were also found to show antitumor activity and have promising potential in cancer therapy .

more than  <dig> curcin genes have been isolated from different jatropha accessions and the amino acid sequences of the deduced curcin proteins are available in genbank. members of curcins share at least 86 % identity at amino acid level. these curcin proteins can be classified into two types. type-i curcins have a precursor of  <dig> amino acid residues and a mature protein of about  <dig> kilo-dalton  and were only identified in jatropha seeds  <cit> . type-ii curcins have a precursor of  <dig> amino acid residues and a mature protein of about 30 kda  <cit> . they were mainly found to be present in jatropha leaves and some of which were induced by abiotic stress  <cit> . the whole genome sequencing of j. curcas indicates that there are three curcin genes and two additional curcin-like genes in the jatropha genome  <cit> . in a companion article, we report the isolation of one type-i curcin gene, curcin  <dig> , and two type-ii curcin genes, curcin 2a  and curcin 2b , from j. curcas md <dig>  an elite indonesia accession. c <dig> and c2a are expressed in developing seeds and young leaves, respectively. however, no c2b transcripts were detected in developing seeds and leaves of j. curcas.

selectable marker genes usually confer antibiotic or herbicide resistance for the selection of transformants during plant transformation. their removal, would eliminate potential environmental and health-related risks and technical barriers for the subsequent rounds of plant transformation. in addition, production of marker-free transgenic plants would increase the consumer acceptance of genetically modified crops and their products. zuo et al.  developed a chemically regulated and cre/loxp-mediated recombination system for marker-free transformation in arabidopsis. in this system, the expression of the cre gene is controlled by an estrogen receptor-based fusion transactivator xve, which is activated by the addition of β-estradiol  <cit> . we successfully adopted this chemically regulated, cre/loxp-mediated marker-free transformation system in rice  <cit>  and j. curcas  <cit> .

here we report the development of marker-free transgenic jatropha plants and c <dig> promoter-driven endosperm-specific rnai mediated c <dig> gene silencing in jatropha seeds. curcin-free jatropha seeds help to detoxify the seedcake as animal feed and address safety concerns on jatropha plantation and seed processing.

RESULTS
generation of transgenic jatropha plants that produced t <dig> seeds with low curcin content
the binary construct pcmfc <dig>  was used to generate transgenic jatropha plants through agrobacterium-mediated jatropha transformation  <cit> . theoretically, the β-estradiol-regulated cre/loxp-mediated dna recombination system in the t-dna region of pcmfc <dig> enables the removal of the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene  in the loxp fragment after β-estradiol induction and the production of marker-free transgenic plants  <cit> . the dna recombination in the marker-free transgenic plants could be detected by pcr analysis using a set of dna primer pairs flanking the loxp sites before or after loxp fragment excision . in this study, marker-free t-dna could be identified by the amplification of the f1-r <dig> fragment  flanking the remaining loxp site after loxp fragment excision, while non-marker-free t-dna, t-dna undergone incomplete loxp fragment excision and truncated t-dna can be detected by the amplification of the f1-r <dig> fragment  flanking the loxp site next to the left border and/or the f2-r <dig> fragment  flanking the loxp site adjacent to the c <dig> promoter .fig.  <dig> a schematic diagram of the t-dna region of the construct pcmfc <dig> and cre/loxp-mediated dna recombination . region flanked by the two loxp sites  in the upper diagram is the loxp fragment, which is excised by cre/loxp-mediated dna recombination after β-estradiol induction  <cit> . lb and rb in pcmfc <dig> are drawn with open boxes, whereas the broken lb and rb due to t-dna integration into plant genome are shown with hatched boxes. t

in total, twelve transgenic t <dig> plants were obtained after agrobacterium-mediated transformation of jatropha cotyledon discs  <cit> . initial pcr analysis indicated that all of the twelve t <dig> plants carried c <dig> promoter-driven rnai cassette for the c <dig> gene, showing the amplification of gus linker . however, six of the twelve t <dig> plants gave amplification of the f1-r <dig> fragment, indicating that they carried marker-free t-dna . the transgenic t <dig> plants grew and developed normally compared to wild-type md <dig> in the same growth condition. t <dig> seeds from the t <dig> plants were collected and used for further molecular analysis. embryos of the t <dig> seeds were dissected and germinated on seed germination medium, while the endosperm from the same set of t <dig> seeds was analyzed individually for c <dig> proteins by western blot analysis. t <dig> plants were transplanted to soil and used for molecular characterization of the transgenes. initial screening identified five t <dig> plants, t0- <dig>  t0- <dig>  t0- <dig>  t0-40a and t0- <dig>  they produced t <dig> seeds that had lower c <dig> content than non-transgenic md <dig> seeds . among the five transgenic lines, t <dig> seeds derived from t0- <dig> and t0- <dig> had the lowest level of c <dig> content . both t0- <dig> and t0- <dig> carried marker-free t-dna, showing the amplification of f1-r <dig> fragment . however, pcr analysis indicated that they also carried the hpt gene . the results suggested that the two t <dig> plants carried both marker-free and non-marker-free t-dnas. t <dig> plants t0-1/t1- <dig>  t0-1/t1- <dig>  t0-35/t1- <dig> and t0-35/t1- <dig> inherited the marker-free t-dnas from the respective t <dig> plants, showing the amplification of the gus linker and f1-r <dig> fragments . however, they also showed the amplification of f2-r <dig> fragment . in addition, t0-1/t1- <dig> and t0-1/t1- <dig> still contained the hpt gene . the results suggested that the t <dig> plants carried either non-marker-free t-dna or truncated t-dna.table  <dig> summary of pcr analysis for t <dig> transgenic plantsa

the c <dig> gene was previously identified to be only expressed in jatropha seeds. in this study, the rnai cassette for the c <dig> gene was driven by a native c <dig> promoter. previously, the c2a gene was found to be mainly expressed in young leaves of j. curcas. to investigate if its expression was affected in the c <dig> rnai plants, proteins from young leaves of the  <dig> transgenic t <dig> plants were isolated and subjected to western blot analysis. c2a with molecular size at about 30 kda was detected and its expression level did not show significant difference in young leaves between md <dig> and the transgenic t <dig> plants . the result indicates that the rnai-mediated gene silencing driven by the endosperm-specific c <dig> promoter did not suppress the expression of the c2a gene in the young leaves of transgenic jatropha plants.

molecular and genetic analyses of transgenic plants
southern blot analysis using the tnos probe identified at least four hybridization bands in t0-1/t1- <dig> when the genomic dna was digested by hindiii or xbai . meanwhile, two to three copies of the hpt gene were detected by the hpt probe . considering that t0-1/t1- <dig> gave pcr amplification of f1-r <dig>  f2-r <dig> and hpt fragments , the results collectively suggested that t0-1/t1- <dig> carried at least one copy of marker-free t-dna and two to three copies of intact or truncated non-marker-free t-dna. in the same southern blot experiment, two hybridization bands were detected in t <dig> plants t0-1/t1-1/t2- <dig> and t0-1/t1-1/t2- <dig> by the tnos probe, respectively . no signal of the hpt gene was detected when the same southern blot was stripped and re-hybridized with the hpt probe . the results indicated that both t0-1/t1-1/t2- <dig> and t0-1/t1-1/t2- <dig> were marker-free plants that carried marker-free t-dna only. as there is no xbai digestion site in the region between the tnos probe and the right border  of t-dna and another xbai site is on the jatropha genomic dna which flanked the t-dna, only one band would be detected by the tnos probe from each marker-free t-dna . therefore, each marker-free t <dig> plant should carry two copies of marker-free t-dna. in addition, both pmli and pmei have only one digestion site in the t-dna region of pcmfc <dig>  respectively . double digestion of t-dna or marker-free t-dna with pmli and pmei releases a 6565-bp pmli-pmei fragment, which includes the intact rnai cassette . indeed, an expected  <dig> -kb pmli-pmei band was detected by the tnos probe in the two marker-free transgenic plants, respectively . the results also confirm that the two copies of the marker-free t-dna in t0-1/t1-1/t2- <dig> or t0-1/t1-1/t2- <dig> are intact after the loxp fragment excision. t0-1/t1-1/t2- <dig> and t0-1/t1-1/t2- <dig> had a similar transgene genotype and belonged to the same transgenic line. the transgenic line was designated as l <dig> fig.  <dig> southern blot analysis of transgenic plants. a to c southern blot analysis of md <dig> and t <dig> plants derived from transgenic t <dig> plant t0-1/t1- <dig>  d to  southern blot analysis of md <dig> and t <dig> plants derived from transgenic t <dig> plant t0-35/t1- <dig>  plant genomic dna was digested by single restriction enzymes hindiii  or xbai  , or with the combination of pmli and pmei  and then fractionated on a  <dig>  % agarose gel. southern blots were probed with t
nos  or hpt  probes. m, dna molecular marker; kb, kilobase



at least four hybridization bands were detected in t0-35/t1- <dig> by the tnos probe . initial pcr analysis using primers hpt-f <dig> and hpt-r <dig> failed to amplify a 969-bp fragment in the 1026-bp coding region of the hpt gene from t0-35/t1- <dig> . however, at least  <dig> hybridization bands were detected in the t <dig> plants by the hpt probe . the results implied that t0-35/t1- <dig> may carry multiple copies of truncated hpt genes. the presence of truncated hpt genes in t0-35/t1- <dig> was further verified by pcr amplification of a 353-bp fragment in the 5’ coding region of the hpt gene using dna primers hpt-f <dig> and hpt-r <dig>  . in the t <dig> generation, both t0-35/t1-1/t2- <dig> and t0-35/t1-1/t2- <dig> produced one major hybridization band when detected by the tnos probe . southern blot analysis using the hpt probe identified three hybridization bands when the genomic dna was digested with hindiii, but only one band when digested with xbai . the results indicated that the three copies of the truncated hpt gene might be inserted into the same locus of jatropha genome. further southern blot analysis using the tnos probe identified a single hybridization band in t0-35/t1-1/t2- <dig> and t0-35/t1-1/t2- <dig>  respectively, when the genomic dna was double digested by pmli and pmei . however, the hybridization band had molecular size at about 20 kb, much greater than the expected 6565-bp pmli-pmei fragment . the result suggested that either one or both of the pmli and pmei sites were mutated or lost in the marker-free t-dnas in the two t <dig> plants, due to illegitimate t-dna integration or cre/loxp-mediated loxp fragment excision. the truncated hpt genes might function due to deletion of large fragment at the 3’ coding region of the hpt gene. t0-35/t1-1/t2- <dig> and t0-35/t1-1/t2- <dig> belonged to the same transgenic line. the transgenic line was designated as l <dig> 

silencing of c <dig> gene expression in endosperm of l <dig> and l35
in the parallel experiments, c <dig> proteins in endosperm of t <dig> seeds of l <dig> and l <dig> and of non-transgenic md <dig> were detected by western blot analysis using anti-c <dig> antibodies. a high level of c <dig> protein was detected in md <dig> endosperm . the putative c <dig> band in the lane of md <dig> endosperm was so strong that it was visible after the proteins in sds-page gel were stained with coomassie brilliant blue . however, the c <dig> protein in l <dig> and l <dig> endosperm was weakly detected in western blot analysis . the results demonstrated that the rnai cassettes in l <dig> and l <dig> were functional in silencing of the c <dig> gene.fig.  <dig> western blot analysis of curcin proteins in the endosperm of transgenic t <dig> seeds of l <dig> and l <dig>  a western blot analysis with total proteins isolated from the endosperm of t <dig> seeds of l <dig>  t0-1/t1-1/t2- <dig> and t0-1/t1-1/t2- <dig> are t <dig> individuals belonged to transgenic line l <dig>  b western blot analysis with total proteins isolated from the endosperm of t <dig> seeds of l <dig>  t0-35/t1-1/t2- <dig> and t0-35/t1-1/t2- <dig> are t <dig> individuals belonged to transgenic line l <dig>  proteins isolated from the endosperm of mature jatropha seeds were separated by sds-page and curcin proteins were detected by anti-c <dig> antibodies. proteins stained with coomassie brilliant blue in duplicate sds-page gels serve as protein loading controls. the arrows indicate the positions of c <dig> in western blot analysis and sds-page gels, respectively



we previously demonstrated that the c <dig> transcripts were highly expressed in 6-week-old developing seeds. the 6-week-old immature t <dig> seeds from l <dig> and l <dig> plants were screened for the presence of rnai cassette. total rna isolated from individual t <dig> seeds was subjected to northern blot analysis for detection of c <dig> transcripts. compared to high level of c <dig> transcripts in the endosperm of non-transgenic md <dig>  the c <dig> transcripts could not be detected in the endosperm of l <dig> and l <dig> seeds that carried the rnai cassette . the results demonstrated that the down regulation of curcin proteins in transgenic jatropha seeds resulted from rnai-mediated c <dig> gene silencing.fig.  <dig> northern blot analysis of c <dig> gene transcripts in the endosperm of t <dig> seeds of l <dig> and l <dig>  total rna was isolated from 6-week-old immature seeds of md <dig> and t <dig> progeny derived from the t <dig> individuals of l <dig>  and l <dig> . rrnas on methylene blue-stained membranes are shown as a loading control



discussion
using endosperm-specific rnai-mediated gene silencing and β-estradiol-regulated cre/loxp system, we have generated two independent transgenic jatropha lines that produce curcin-deficient transgenic seeds. line l <dig> consisted of two t <dig> plants, t0-1/t1-1/t2- <dig> and t0-1/t1-1/t2- <dig>  which were derived from t <dig> plant t0- <dig>  l <dig> plants carry two copies of marker-free rnai cassette for the c <dig> gene. the two rnai cassettes may be separated in the subsequent generations if they are not closely linked to each other. line l <dig> had two t <dig> plants, t0-35/t1-1/t2- <dig> and t0-35/t1-1/t2- <dig>  which were derived from t <dig> plant t0- <dig>  l <dig> plants carry a single copy of marker-free rnai cassette for the c <dig> gene and three copies of closely linked but truncated hpt genes. l <dig> plants may eliminate the truncated hpt genes in subsequent generations if they could be separated from the marker-free rnai cassette. in both transgenic lines, the functional marker-free rnai cassettes could be used for further jatropha breeding through marker-assisted selection.

we previously demonstrated that c <dig> is specifically expressed and stored in the endosperm of jatropha seeds. jatropha also produces type ii curcins that are mainly expressed in leaves  <cit> . to prevent the function of other curcin proteins being disrupted in other plant tissues, we chose native c <dig> promoter to drive c <dig> inverted repeats interspersed by a gus linker. our studies on c <dig> transcripts in developing endosperm and curcin proteins in mature endosperm demonstrated that the expression of the c <dig> gene was efficiently suppressed or completely silenced by the c <dig> promoter-driven rnai-mediated gene silencing. patade et al.,  made a 35s promoter-driven rnai cassette for curcin genes and used agrobacterium-mediated in planta transformation to produce transformed jatropha plants  <cit> . the authors reported that the transcripts of curcin precursor gene were reduced by more than 98 % to undetectable level  <cit> . however, the research paper did not provide any data on molecular analysis of stable insertion of t-dna in jatropha genome, biochemical analysis on curcin proteins in the leaves and seeds of transformed plants. furthermore, no genetic analysis or data was given on transmission of the 35s promoter-driven rnai cassette from the putative transformed plants to their progeny. the c <dig> proteins in endosperm of transgenic seeds produced in this study were weakly detected by western blot analysis. in contrast, the content of c2a, a curcin protein specifically expressed in young leaves of j. curcas was not affected in the t <dig> plants of the two lines by the endosperm-specific rnai-mediated gene silencing for the c <dig> gene. considering the possible involvement of c2a in plant growth and development and its function in response to biotic or abiotic stress  <cit> , its unchanged content in leaves would imply a smaller impact on the transgenic plants. previously, two additional unknown proteins with one at about 35 kda and another at about 17 kda were identified in endosperm of j. curcas by anti-c <dig> antibodies in western blot analysis. interestingly, the content of these two proteins was reduced or silenced in the two rnai lines, indicating that they may be curcin-related proteins or derivatives and were silenced by the rnai cassette for the c <dig> gene.

the chemically regulated, cre/loxp-mediated dna recombination system is an efficient inducible dna recombination that has been used to generate marker-free transgenic plants in arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and j. curcas  <cit> . although the efficiency of cre/loxp-mediated dna recombination is high, the rate of obtaining marker-free transgenic plants can be dramatically reduced by incomplete loxp fragment excision, and by multiple and/or truncated t-dna insertion  <cit> . in this study, 10 t <dig> plants were identified to carry marker-free t-dna after loxp fragment excision. however, all of them carry additional non-marker-free or truncated t-dna. as a result, the marker-free plants were only identified in the subsequent generations. for this study, the β-estradiol induction for cre/loxp-mediated dna recombination was performed with regenerated hygromycin-resistant shoots rather than with hygromycin-resistant calli before regeneration. in this scenario, β-estradiol might not efficiently access to all types of cells, especially meristem and germline cells in the regenerated shoots. for future study, the β-estradiol induction can be performed with hygromycin-resistant calli before regeneration.

CONCLUSIONS
using endosperm-specific rnai-mediated gene silencing and β-estradiol-regulated cre/loxp system, we have developed marker-free transgenic jatropha plants that produce curcin-deficient seeds. the c <dig> promoter-driven rnai cassette for the c <dig> gene in transgenic plants was functional and heritable. both c <dig> transcripts and c <dig> proteins were greatly down-regulated or silenced in the endosperm of transgenic plants. the marker-free transgenic plants and curcin-deficient seeds developed in this study provided a solution for the toxicity of curcins in jatropha seeds and addressed the safety concerns of marker genes in transgenic plants on the environment.
