BACKGROUND
with the increasing amount of biological information derived from genome sequencing projects of several plant species  <cit> , opportunities exist for functional analysis of those sequences using a combination of computational approaches and various methods of wet laboratory analyses of gene expression. the recent release of the soybean genome  <cit>  has tremendously facilitated computational genome-wide analyses of the soybean genome and identification of specific dna sequences, which need to be validated using functional analysis tools. the availability of the soybean genome has also provided unprecedented access to sequences for a wide range of promoters from diverse gene families, which will lead to a better understanding of the regulation of gene expression and the discovery of novel soybean promoters for use in basic research and applied crop biotechnology.

promoters are the primary regulators of gene expression at the transcriptional level and are key to controlling transgenes in transgenic organisms  <cit> . the use of one or only a few different promoters to direct expression of different genes in transgene stacks can lead to homology-based gene silencing and unpredictable transgene expression in transgenic plants  <cit> . consequently, it is absolutely necessary to increase the availability of different promoters for plant transformation. although the constitutive highly-expressed cauliflower mosaic virus 35s  promoter is commonly used for gene regulation in plants, different plant genomes can provide additional useful native plant promoters ranging from highly-expressing constitutive to tissue-specific and inducible. likewise, analyses of native promoters will most likely reveal a large variety of heretofore undiscovered cis-regulatory elements, which will increase our understanding of gene expression regulation  <cit> . although several plant promoters are available as an alternative to the camv35s promoter, very few soybean promoters have been isolated and extensively characterized in soybean  <cit> , in spite of the world-wide economic impact of this crop.

we recently reported the isolation and characterization of a glycine max polyubiquitin  promoter, which leads to high constitutive levels of both transient  <cit>  and stable gene expression in various tissues of transgenic soybeans  <cit> . other plant ubiquitin promoters have also been isolated and characterized in a wide variety of plant species  <cit> . particularly, ubiquitin promoters from rice  <cit>  and maize  <cit>  have been extensively characterized and frequently used in both basic research and in the production of commercial transgenics. ubiquitin promoters typically drive strong constitutive gene expression, which is especially high in young tissues, vascular tissues and pollen  <cit> . the enhancement of gene expression from the presence of the leading intron in the different ubiquitin promoters has also received considerable attention  <cit> . in spite of the emphasis on the use of ubiquitin promoters, most studies to date have relied on single promoter sequences isolated from different plant species  <cit> . however, the ubiquitin gene family is quite large in most plants and isolation and characterization of different ubiquitin promoters, from the same plant, could serve as a source of additional promoters and provide useful information on how different ubiquitin genes are differentially regulated.

as ubiquitin promoters tend to drive constitutive gene expression, additional promoter sequences from inducible genes may also be of interest  <cit> . the ethylene response factor  gene family encodes a large group of transcription factors characterized by the presence of a single ap2/erf domain  <cit> . erf proteins play important roles in ethylene-mediated gene transcription  <cit>  and in a wide range of biotic and abiotic stress responses such as pathogen attack  <cit> , drought tolerance, salt tolerance and low temperatures  <cit> . the erf genes therefore could be excellent sources for inducible promoters, which most likely contain interesting cis-regulatory elements within their sequences.

promoter characterization typically involves the introduction and analysis of dna constructs containing promoters fused to a reporter gene. temporal and tissue-specific expression of the reporter gene can then be directly observed and quantified in transgenic plant tissues. although soybean transformation was first reported many years ago  <cit> , it remains consistent but inefficient  <cit>  and it may not be entirely suitable for medium- to high-throughput analysis of soybean promoters. due to this limitation, analyses of soybean promoters and their cis-regulatory elements are often performed using heterologous plant expression systems such as arabidopsis and tobacco  <cit> . analyses using heterologous systems have value but validation of soybean promoters in soybean  <cit> , or at least in another member of the fabaceae family, is preferred as heterologous systems may not accurately reflect promoter strength and specificity  <cit> .

for rapid analysis of promoters, transient gene expression offers many advantages and some disadvantages compared with the use of stably-transformed tissues. transient expression can be detected as early as  <dig> h post dna introduction in soybean tissues  <cit> , which is quite useful for rapid estimation of promoter activity. depending on the method for dna introduction  <cit> , different tissue types can be targeted for gene delivery, allowing increased flexibility in construct evaluations. in our laboratory, transient expression has been successfully used for evaluation of soybean promoter variants  <cit> , but these evaluations were performed using lima bean  cotyledons. transient expression analysis for promoter validation using soybean cotyledons as an alternate target to lima bean cotyledons has not been previously reported.

for evaluation of constructs in stably-transformed soybean tissues, the production of hairy roots provides the most rapid and efficient method for generation of transgenic soybean tissues. soybean hairy root cultures induced by agrobacterium rhizogenes have been successfully used for rapid analysis of soybean cyst nematode infestation  <cit> , improvement of genetic transformation efficiencies  <cit>  and analysis of phenolic metabolism  <cit> . as an alternate approach, composite plants  <cit>  consisting of hairy roots on non-transgenic shoots are also useful for rapid evaluation of gene expression in stably transformed soybean tissues  <cit> . previous molecular analyses conducted on soybean hairy roots have revealed the presence of high copy number integrations  <cit> , although the relationship between high copy number insertions and gene expression in hairy roots has not been reported.

with the aim of discovering unique and useful soybean promoters with potential applications in both basic research and crop improvement, we here identify, clone and validate  <dig> novel soybean promoters from the ubiquitin and erf gene families. we present two different and complementary promoter validation tools based on transient expression in lima bean cotyledons and production of stably-transformed soybean hairy roots. quantitative gene expression analysis of these  <dig> new soybean promoters using  <dig> different promoter validation tools allows us to greatly expand the toolbox of available soybean promoters.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis of the gmubi and gmerf genes
phylogenetic analyses of the gene models in the soybean genome revealed at least  <dig> genes whose predicted amino acid sequences contained at least one ubiquitin-coding unit . of these,  <dig> genes were similar to the ubiquitin gene family that includes gmubi1- <dig> . the other  <dig> genes contained a lower number of ubiquitin-like coding units more similar to those found in other proteins such as the apoptotic regulator scythe and the adaptor molecule rad <dig>  <cit> . the gmubi1- <dig> genes all belong to the same polyubiquitin-containing family; whereas, the gmubi <dig> gene belongs to a different, small monoubiquitin-containing subfamily .

phylogenetic analyses of the erf/ap <dig> genes from soybean revealed a total of  <dig> genes, which could be annotated as ap2/erf genes . of these,  <dig> genes were not incorporated into the phylogenetic tree as they were either too divergent or incorrectly predicted . a total of  <dig> erf/ap <dig> genes were retained, including the ten chosen for this study. the soybean ap2/erf family is broadly similar to that from other higher plant species and can be subdivided into the erf and ap <dig> subfamilies . similar to arabidopsis  <cit>  and tobacco  <cit> , the erf family could be further subdivided into the dreb  and the erf subfamilies . one additional subfamily was apparent and may be related to the members of group vi-l and xb-l as these proteins were omitted from both the arabidopsis and tobacco analyses. this phylogenetic analysis provides a framework for the study of promoters from other members of the soybean ap2/erf multigene family and illustrates the phylogenetic positions of the  <dig> group ix gmerf genes used for promoter isolation in this study. the gmerf1- <dig> genes were chosen as they are likely to be wound- and/or jasmonate-inducible based on their phylogenetic position  <cit> .

evaluation of soybean and lima bean cotyledons for transient expression analysis
transient gene expression in soybean and lima bean cotyledons was conducted and compared with the initial aim of developing a soybean-based transient expression system for validation of soybean promoters. introduction of the 35s-gfp construct into soybean cotyledons resulted in relatively high levels of gene expression, followed by a very rapid decline . in soybean, the gfp appeared to diffuse from the targeted cells into the surrounding cells a few hours after bombardment. gfp was minimally detected using our automated image collection system ~ <dig> h after bombardment . time-lapse animations of gfp expression tracked for  <dig> h in bombarded soybean cotyledons clearly showed the rapid loss of gfp in the primary targeted cells and the apparent diffusion to the surrounding cells . in contrast, in lima bean cotyledonary cells, transient gfp expression modulated by the 35s-gfp construct appeared to remain localized in single cells  and time-lapse animations revealed that gfp was visible for over  <dig> h . confocal microscopy of soybean cotyledonary cells, conducted  <dig> h after bombardment with the 35s-gfp plasmid confirmed high levels of gfp in the cytoplasm and nuclei of the main targeted cells, but also low levels of gfp in the cytoplasm and nuclei of the adjacent cotyledonary cells . confocal microscopy also confirmed restriction of gfp to the main targeted cell in bombarded lima bean cotyledonary tissues . this analysis also revealed basic differences in cotyledon cell morphology between lima bean and soybean. for example, soybean cotyledonary cells were considerably smaller and more regularly-shaped than lima bean cells and contained smaller vacuoles .

to investigate if the apparent gfp diffusion visualized in soybean cotyledonary cells was related to the small size of gfp, a translational fusion of gfp::hygromycin  <cit>  was introduced into both soybean and lima bean cotyledons. although gfp levels and the numbers of gfp-expressing cells were considerably lower than obtained earlier with the 35s-gfp introduction, gfp expression from the translational fusion remained in the targeted cells longer in both plants and was detected until over  <dig> h after transformation . confocal microscopy of soybean cotyledons, bombarded with the gfp::hygromycin translational fusion confirmed strong gfp expression in the cytoplasm and nuclei of targeted cells but a clear reduction of gfp levels in the adjacent cells . confocal analysis of lima bean cotyledons showed high levels of gfp in the cytoplasm and nuclei of targeted cells and no detectable gfp levels in the adjacent cells .

transient expression analysis of promoters using lima bean cotyledons
the upstream regions of gene coding sequences for  <dig> gmubi and  <dig> gmerf genes  were cloned 5' to the gfp gene and rapidly characterized. profiles of transient gfp expression were generated for all  <dig> soybean promoters, along with the camv35s promoter, using lima bean cotyledons as target tissue . gfp expression was first detectable in cotyledonary cells 2- <dig> h after dna introduction and became almost undetectable with our automated image collection and analysis system  <cit>  ~ <dig> h after dna delivery.

the transient expression profiles were mostly similar for all the gmubi promoters regardless of promoter strength. however, gfp expression peaks for the strong gmubi promoters appeared to be reached later than the low-expressing promoters or the camv35s promoter. most of the gmubi promoters gave rise to exceptionally high levels of transient gfp expression based on a comparison to the camv35s promoter; the y-axis in figure  <dig> is the percent of peak camv35s expression. the gmubi <dig>  gmubi <dig>  gmubi <dig>  gmubi <dig>  gmubi <dig>  gmubi <dig> and gmubi <dig> promoters displayed a ~2-7-fold increase in expression over levels obtained with the camv35s promoter . the gmubi <dig> and gmubi <dig> promoters showed similar levels of transient gfp expression compared with the camv35s, while use of the gmubi <dig> promoter resulted in very low levels of gfp expression.

the transient expression profiles generated for the gmerf promoters also showed a range of promoter strengths but reasonable consistency in the timing of peak expression . the times for peak gfp expression driven by the gmerf promoters were more variable than those observed for the gmubi promoters but were consistently later than camv35s-driven gfp peak . although many of the gmerf promoters resulted in lower gfp levels than the gmubi promoters, some gave higher expression than the camv35s promoter. the gmerf <dig>  gmerf <dig>  gmerf <dig>  and gmerf <dig> promoters exhibited ~ <dig> - <dig> -times higher gfp levels compared to the camv35s promoter. the gmerf <dig>  gmerf <dig> and gmerf <dig> promoters showed similar gfp levels to camv35s, while gmerf <dig>  gmerf <dig> and gmerf <dig> promoters gave rise to lower levels of transient gfp expression .

stable expression analysis using soybean hairy roots
in addition to analysis of promoter activity using transient expression, promoter strength was assessed in stably-transformed soybean hairy roots. one week after a. rhizogenes-inoculation of soybean cotyledons, numerous small cell clusters composed of both gfp- and non gfp-expressing cells were evident in the wounded sites located on the abaxial side of the inoculated cotyledons. approximately two weeks after inoculation, the cotyledons formed numerous roots, which were 72% gfp-positive . although the clear majority of gfp-expressing root events appeared to express gfp homogeneously, formation of chimeric roots was occasionally observed. most hairy roots were relatively prolific and grew quickly following subculture to fresh oms medium. secondary roots could be excised and used to generate additional clonal tissues for analysis.

the intensities of gfp expression mediated by the soybean promoters and a camv35s promoter construct in soybean hairy roots were determined using image analysis. many of the gmubi promoters gave rise to significantly higher levels of gfp expression than the camv35s promoter used as a control . the strongest gmubi promoters  showed a ~2-4-fold increase in gfp expression over levels given by the camv35s promoter . the gmubi <dig>  gmubi <dig> and gmubi <dig> promoters gave rise to similar or slightly higher levels of gfp than the camv35s promoter, while the gmubi <dig> promoter showed the lowest gfp expression among the gmubi promoters.

the gmerf promoters displayed somewhat lower gfp intensities in hairy roots than the gmubi promoters but some of these promoters displayed higher expression levels than the camv <dig> promoter . the gmerf <dig>  gmerf <dig> and gmerf <dig> promoters showed ~ <dig> - <dig> -times higher gfp than camv35s . the gmerf <dig>  gmerf <dig> and gmerf <dig> promoters exhibited similar gfp compared to the camv35s promoter; whereas the gmerf <dig>  gmerf <dig>  gmerf <dig> and gmerf <dig> promoters directed lower levels of gfp compared to the camv35s promoter.

although the average gfp expression levels were determined based on image analysis of different soybean hairy root events, an unexpected large variation in gfp intensities among different root events was observed for all of the promoters evaluated, including the camv35s promoter. as a result of this large variation, the standard deviations for gfp intensity means were quite large for most of the promoters . analysis of gfp expression in numerous secondary roots from the same primary root event was performed using events containing the gmubi <dig>  gmerf <dig> and gmerf <dig> promoters. although a large variation in gfp intensities was seen among primary roots, the variation in gfp intensity was much smaller in the secondary roots generated from single primary roots . a remarkable reduction of the standard deviations for gfp intensity means in secondary roots was also apparent .

southern hybridization analysis
with the aim of studying the transgene integration patterns present in the soybean transgenic hairy roots and determining if a relationship existed between gfp intensity and transgene copy number, southern hybridization analysis was conducted on genomic dna isolated from either gmerf6- or gmerf10-containing hairy roots using the gfp coding region as the hybridization probe. hybridization signals were detected in all the transformed hairy root lines analyzed , confirming the stable integration of the gfp coding sequence in the genomes. the lanes containing dna from hairy roots induced with a. rhizogenes harboring no binary vector, showed no hybridization bands . as bsrgi recognizes a single site within the t-dna of pcambia-promoter constructs, the presence of one to seven variable-size bands in the genomic dna from either gmerf6- or gmerf10-containing roots indicates t-dna integrations ranging from one to seven copies .

transgene copy number from the southern hybridization analysis was also directly correlated with the gfp expression intensity displayed in the transgenic hairy roots that were used for genomic dna extraction . hairy root events with high transgene copy number generally displayed high gfp intensities; whereas, hairy roots events with single or low t-dna copy number gave low or moderate gfp intensities.

discussion
bioinformatics analysis of the gmubi and gmerf gene families of soybean
the polyubiquitin gene family in soybean  contains three moderately well characterized genes ; however, other family members have received little to no attention. the promoters regulating these genes have likewise not been well characterized but show promise as strong constitutive promoters based on recently-reported transcriptome data  <cit>  and previous characterizations of a soybean polyubiquitin promoter   <cit>  that was recloned in this current research as a slightly longer promoter and renamed "gmubi3".

the erf genes were classified based on their coding sequences, and particularly on the presence of the well-conserved ap2/erf dna-binding domain  <cit> . the phylogeny of gmerf genes in this study  was very similar to phylogenies previously reported for erfs in rice, arabidopsis and tobacco  <cit> , confirming that this family of transcription factor is quite conserved among different plants. a previous phylogenetic analysis of gmerf genes revealed the presence of  <dig> unigenes containing a complete ap2/erf domain in soybean  <cit> ; however, we here report  <dig> ap2/erf-containing gmerf genes using data from the recently released soybean genome assembly, representing a significant update for this gene family in soybean.

transient expression assays in soybean and lima bean cotyledons
quantitative characterization of soybean promoters was rapidly assessed using both transient gene expression in lima bean cotyledons and stable expression in soybean hairy roots. we have previously reported the use of lima bean cotyledons for rapid analyses of transient gene expression  <cit>  and characterization of viral suppressors of gene silencing  <cit> . in this report, we also evaluate soybean cotyledons as a potential target tissue for rapid validation of soybean promoters. in soybean cotyledons, initial attempts to visualize gfp at the  <dig> hour time point, which is the peak expression time for the lima bean target  <cit> , were unsuccessful as only very low levels of gfp were observed. however, use of our automated image collection system  <cit>  for semi-continuous monitoring of gfp expression revealed that the gfp protein apparently diffused rapidly from the initial target cell in soybean cotyledons, leading to depletion of scorable gfp levels . in lima bean cells, rapid diffusion of gfp was not detected in the cells surrounding the original targeted cell, although it may occur at reduced levels. the loss of the gfp protein observed using soybean cotyledons suggests that there are basic differences in the epidermal cell structures in lima beans and soybeans. confocal microscopy indeed confirmed some major differences in the anatomy of epidermal cells .

retention of gfp in the targeted cells after bombardment is definitely preferable for gene expression analysis. the rapid loss of gfp in soybean cotyledonary cells made analysis difficult and this target tissue is completely unsuitable for transient expression analysis using single time point determinations. the presence of small amounts of gfp at the  <dig> h time point could be misinterpreted as the absence of expression, which was not the case. since single time point determinations at  <dig> h are often used for transient expression analysis using gfp  <cit>  and gus  <cit> , loss of transient gene expression as reported here in soybean cotyledonary tissues should be recognized as a potential problem in interpreting results. the use of dynamic semi-continuous monitoring of gene expression using our automated image collection system facilitated the detection of gfp loss from targeted cells, and movement into the surrounding cells. without semi-continuous monitoring, movement of gfp may not have been perceived.

transient expression of gfp in cells of lima bean cotyledons was far more consistent over time compared to soybean cotyledons . lima bean cotyledons therefore offer a more suitable target tissue for quantitative transient gfp expression assays. loss of gfp from the targeted soybean cotyledonary cells was somewhat reduced through the use of a translational fusion of gfp to the hygromycin resistance gene , resulting in production of a larger fusion protein. however, use of this translational fusion resulted in much lower apparent gfp intensities and fewer foci . we have previously reported that translational fusions containing gfp give rise to considerable reductions of transient gfp intensities in lima bean cotyledonary cells, probably due to either a quenching of fluorescence by the protein partner or conformational changes in gfp as a result of an alteration of the chromophore structure  <cit> . although use of translational fusions can be used to minimize loss of the small gfp protein from certain target tissues, the effects of the fusion partner on gfp detection need to be considered when this approach is utilized.

transient expression mediated by gmubi and gmerf promoters
in this study, the gmubi1- <dig> promoters were isolated from polyubiquitin genes sharing high homology  but containing variable numbers of the ubiquitin-coding unit  <cit> . the gmubi <dig>  gmubi <dig>  gmubi <dig> and gmubi <dig> contained  <dig> ubiquitin-coding units; the gmubi <dig> and gmubi <dig> contained  <dig> ubiquitin-coding units; and the gmubi <dig>  gmubi <dig> and gmubi <dig> contained  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ubiquitin-coding units, respectively. the gmubi <dig> promoter was isolated from a more distant relative gene containing a monomeric ubiquitin-coding unit . although the gmubi1- <dig> promoters gave rise to relatively high levels of gene expression, the gmubi <dig> promoter displayed consistently low expression levels in both transient expression and hairy roots. all of the reports to date describing ubiquitin promoters in different plants have focused on polyubiquitin gene promoters  <cit> .

the gmubi promoters characterized here were either intron-containing or intron-less promoters. the gmubi1- <dig> gene sequences contained predicted introns in the 5'-utr, which were predicted to splice to acceptor sites generated during promoter cloning just prior to the initiation codon of the gfp coding sequence. the gmubi8- <dig> gene sequences contained no predicted introns in the 5'-utr. to our knowledge, no characterization of native intron-less plant ubiquitin promoters has been previously reported. although in this study there were no evident differences between transient gfp expression levels mediated by the intron-containing or the intron-less gmubi promoters, the introns within the 5'utr of most polyubiquitin promoters quantitatively enhance transgene expression levels  <cit> .

although most of the gmubi promoters directed overall high expression levels, the gmubi <dig> promoter gave exceptionally high levels of gfp expression. this high gene expression driven by the gmubi <dig> promoter is not surprising as the gmubi <dig> gene is highly active in different organs of soybean  <cit> . we previously reported 5-fold greater transient gfp expression using a slightly truncated version of the gmubi <dig> promoter  compared to a camv35s promoter  <cit> . in the present study, the gmubi <dig> promoter  gave rise to 7-fold greater transient gfp expression compared to the same camv35s promoter. we have also reported that removal of the intron from the 5'utr of the gmubi promoter resulted in much lower levels of both transient expression in lima bean cotyledons  <cit>  and stable expression in transgenic soybeans  <cit> . although the intensity of expression was altered by the removal of the intron from the 5'utr of the gmubi promoter, the pattern of expression remained the same. collectively, these results indicate that the intronic and upstream regions of this promoter may contain important cis-regulatory elements responsible for high levels of expression. an in-depth functional analysis of the gmubi <dig> promoter may allow the identification of specific promoter elements that lead to this high gene expression.

the transient expression profiles from the gmerf promoters  were similar regardless of promoter strength. however, the time of peak gfp expression for the different gmerf promoters was more inconsistent compared to the expression peaks for the gmubi promoters. this variability in expression peaks among the gmerf promoters may be associated with the transcriptional regulation of erf genes under conditions of stress  <cit> .

the gmerf promoters characterized in the present study were isolated from group ix gmerf genes , which share high homology with group ix tobacco erf genes  <cit> . transcription of group ix erf genes in tobacco and soybean can be induced after wounding or exogenous application of methyl jasmonate   <cit> . particularly, a group ix soybean erf gene , with high similarity to the gmerf <dig> gene sequence identified here , displayed high expression levels in soybean seedlings after exogenous application of meja, ethylene and salicylic acid, or growth under cold and salt conditions  <cit> . as gene transcription is largely regulated by cis-acting regulatory elements within the promoter sequences  <cit> , the promoters from the group ix gmerf genes may be good candidates to direct inducible transgene expression. further in-depth functional characterization of the gmerf promoters validated herein along with their potential cis-regulatory elements may also be of particular interest to increase the current knowledge of gene transcription regulation under various stress conditions.

1the gmubi8- <dig> promoters do not contain intron sequences within their 5'utr.

2the gmubi <dig> promoter was isolated from a monoubiquitin gene containing a monomeric ubiquitin-coding unit.

gene expression mediated by gmubi and gmerf promoters in hairy roots
the percentage of gfp-positive hairy roots achieved here  is substantially higher than previously reported for a. rhizogenes-induced hairy roots of soybean   <cit> . the development of the hairy root phenotype caused by a. rhizogenes is the result of the integration and expression of t-dna contained in the bacterial root inducing  plasmid in the plant genome  <cit> . a. rhizogenes can also transfer the t-dna from binary vectors, leading to the formation of hairy roots with or without the binary vector t-dna. the ratios of hairy roots with and without the binary vector t-dna can vary tremendously across different plants  <cit> .

gfp detection and analysis in hairy roots was relatively straightforward as hairy roots do not contain chlorophyll, which can otherwise interfere with gfp detection  <cit> . to counteract chlorophyll interference with gfp detection, different methodologies have been developed for chlorophyll elimination in photosynthetic tissues, including exposure to alcohol  <cit> , application of photobleaching herbicides  <cit>  or use of gene silencing to suppress the phytoene desaturase  gene  <cit> . however, chlorophyll elimination treatments are notably harsh and demand additional manipulation of tissues, which may alter transgene expression, particularly expression of inducible dna constructs.

gfp expression in soybean hairy roots was quite variable among different events containing the same promoter construct, although some general conclusions could be made about promoter strength using this validation tool. similar to quantitative analysis of transient expression in lima bean cotyledonary tissue, the gmubi <dig> and the gmubi <dig> promoters also gave the highest and the lowest gfp intensity, respectively, in soybean hairy roots. the gmubi <dig>  gmubi <dig>  gmubi <dig>  gmubi <dig> and gmubi <dig> promoters showed quite similar gfp expression intensities using both validation tools. however, a comparison of transient and stable expression intensities using the gmubi <dig>  gmubi <dig> and gmubi <dig> promoters showed some inconsistencies in promoter strength using the two different validation tools . the gmubi <dig>  gmubi <dig> and gmubi <dig> promoters may be the most interesting for further analysis as they show the greatest disparity in expression using transient and stable expression analyses.

gfp levels driven by the camv35s promoter in both transient and hairy roots were considered as moderate

the gfp intensities determined for gmerf promoters using hairy roots in general also correlated with the transient gfp levels determined using lima bean cotyledons. the gmerf <dig>  gmerf <dig> and gmerf <dig> promoters were the most inconsistent expressers in this group . expression directed by these promoters may be affected by the wounding or other stresses caused by tissue manipulation and particle bombardment. further studies on these  <dig> promoters in stably-transformed tissues may be of particular interest to identify regulatory regions within promoters that are responsive to various stimuli.

the transient expression system reported here differs considerably from the hairy root expression system, relative to the fate of the introduced dna and the nature of the expressing tissue. any consistency in expression intensity using the two validation tools, suggests a certain robustness in promoter activity. for transient expression using particle bombardment, large amounts of dna are introduced  <cit>  on each particle and cells that express the introduced dna usually contain a particle in, or adjacent to the nucleus  <cit> . transient expression results in a rapid increase in gene expression, followed by a rapid decline , which has been partly attributed to gene silencing of transient expression  <cit> . therefore, during transient expression in lima bean cotyledonary cells, large amounts of plasmid dna are delivered to the nucleus, which result in very high levels of extrachromosomal gene expression. preintegrative, extrachromosomal dnas may not be subject to the same regulatory influences as genomic dna and this dna may have different access to transcription factors. nevertheless, transient expression might be a good early indicator of promoter strength in stably-transformed tissues  <cit> .

stably-expressed promoters that are introduced in soybean hairy roots are integrated into genomic dna and expression in this tissue may more accurately reflect promoter activity in its native context. however, gene expression may also be affected by integration site and transgene copy number  <cit> , as well as the status of the transgenic tissues. although the soybean hairy root system may not be optimal for validation of some tissue-specific promoters, we have successfully used this system for validation of large number of promoters including promoters identified as "seed specific" . consistency in the intensity of gene expression using these two different validation tools suggests good stability and accurate prediction of relative promoter strengths.

southern hybridization analysis and transgene copy number
gfp intensities were quite variable in independent primary hairy root events . this variation in gene expression across stably-transformed events has been often attributed to the site of transgene insertion and transgene copy number  <cit> . the insertion site, copy number and structure of integrated dna differs, depending on the transformation methods utilized. direct transformation methods such as particle bombardment can frequently result in the insertion of large copy numbers of plasmid dna at a single-site, leading to transgene silencing  <cit> . gene cassettes or minimal constructs can reduce or eliminate this effect  <cit> . on the other hand, transformation using agrobacterium typically results in lower copy number gene introductions, which has been reported to give more consistent transgene expression  <cit> .

our results suggest that the variability in gfp gene expression in soybean hairy roots was associated with the copy number of the introduced t-dna. the highest gfp expression levels were associated with roots that contained the highest copy numbers of introduced dnas. use of agrobacterium tumefaciens for transformation usually results in the integration of single or low t-dna copies into the plant genome  <cit> . although use of a. rhizogenes can lead to high copy t-dna integration  <cit> , the relationship between high copy number integration and transgene expression has not been previously reported in hairy roots. using arabidopsis plants containing sequentially increasing copy numbers of a camv35s-driven gfp gene, schubert et al.  <cit>  demonstrated increases in gfp expression levels when up to  <dig> copies of a camv35s-driven gfp gene were present. as the copy number was increased to  <dig> and greater, gfp expression was suppressed. schubert et al.  <cit>  further suggested that suppression occurs once a gene expression threshold is reached and is gene-specific.

in this study, hairy roots containing up to  <dig> t-dna inserts  displayed the highest gfp expression and did not show gene suppression. a significant correlation of high gfp expression with high copy number integration was observed with the gmerf <dig> and gmerf <dig> promoters , both of which displayed higher expression levels than the camv35s promoter in soybean hairy roots . if a threshold copy number/expression level is required to silence the gfp gene, that threshold was not reached in the transgenic hairy roots.

the use of hairy roots to validate promoter activity is a simple alternative for gauging promoter strength in stably-transformed plants, although the influence of copy number on gene expression should be considered  <cit> . the transient expression analysis used in this research may nevertheless be more reflective of general promoter strength as each cell receives similar high copy numbers of each dna construct, and hundreds to thousands of cells are collectively analyzed. as transient expression is analyzed prior to dna integration, complications from conformational and positional effects in genomic dna are avoided.

CONCLUSIONS
we report here the isolation and characterization of  <dig> novel soybean promoters from two different gene families, ubiquitin and erf. a rapid quantitative evaluation of promoter strength was consistently performed in both transiently-expressing cotyledonary tissues of lima bean and stably-transformed hairy roots of soybean. we also provide novel insights towards the utilization of transient and stable expression systems for promoter validation.
