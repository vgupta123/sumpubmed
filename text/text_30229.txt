BACKGROUND
mental retardation  is a common disorder affecting 1–3% of the general population  <cit> . an excess of affected males over females has been noted among mentally delayed patients, especially in moderate to severe mr. this phenomenon has usually been explained by the presence of many genes responsible for mr on the x chromosome. x-linked mr  is an heterogeneous condition representing an important proportion of patients affected by mr and can be classified either as nonsyndromic, when mental delay is the only symptom, or as syndromic when mr is associated with other specific clinical features.

copy number variations  are defined as copy number changes including deletions, insertions and duplications of genomic regions that range from one kilobase  to megabases  in size. cnvs can influence gene expression by directly disrupting genes or by altering gene dosage  <cit> , and some are involved in specific genetic disorders such as microdeletion and microduplication syndromes . several studies report an incidence of cryptic chromosomal imbalances in about 10–25% of mr cases  <cit> . other copy number variations are present as polymorphisms in the general population without apparent relation to disease  <cit> . several of these cryptic chromosomal rearrangements occur in regions flanked by segmental duplications or low-copy repeats and likely result from non-allelic homologous recombination between different copies of these repeats  <cit> .

nowadays, array-based comparative genomic hybridization  represents a useful and cost-effective tool for the detection of submicroscopic copy number changes in genetic diseases  <cit> . here, we describe the development, validation and use of a bac derived tiling path array covering the entire euchromatic portion of the human x chromosome, which has allowed the screening for copy number changes in  <dig> xlmr patients.

RESULTS
validation of the x-chromosome bac array
sensitivity and specificity of the x-array to detect copy number changes were tested with dna from four patients with known cytogenetic aberrations on the x chromosome . in all these individuals, the corresponding changes in copy number were clearly detected and confirmed by the array-cgh. a series of sex mismatched hybridizations of controls versus controls, as well as self-self hybridizations allowed the detection of clones in the array that performed abnormally. criteria for considering problematic clones were: 1) clones with absolute value of log <dig> ratios >  <dig>  in self-self hybridizations, 2) clones with high standard deviations   in different hybridizations and 3) clones displaying normal log <dig> ratios within a known aberration. thirty clones were considered problematic and were excluded from further analyses.

array cgh findings in x-linked mr patients
fifty-two patients with unexplained xlmr and two patients with an x-linked trait were analyzed using the tiling path x chromosome array. copy number variations were observed in  <dig> patients  and in  <dig> patients , we identified imbalances probably causative of the phenotype observed in the patients. an overview of these imbalances is shown in figure  <dig>  table  <dig> summarizes the phenotype and genotype of these  <dig> patients.

nd, not determined; in bold are represented the genes related to mr.

known genomic aberrations
in the two patients with a presumed rearrangement in the short arm of the x chromosome , aberrations in these regions were identified by the array cgh.

case 1
case one was a newborn biochemically diagnosed of otc deficiency. his mother had been diagnosed of otc deficiency and associated neurological impairment since childhood. we identified a small deletion  at xp <dig>  both in the patient and his mother. this deletion involved six adjacent clones  and otc, tspan <dig>  and rpgr genes at xp <dig>   <cit> . deletion of the otc and rpgr genes in the patient was confirmed by pcr. deletion of the tmsf <dig> gene was confirmed by mlpa both in the patient and his mother .

case 2
case two was a boy with clinical suspicion of norrie disease. he presented a severe psychomotor retardation without verbal language skills, microcephaly, bilateral retinal detachment and epilepsy. a deletion spanning  <dig> clones with an estimate size of  <dig> mb was identified at xp <dig>  in the patient and his mother . array results confirmed the clinical suspicion of norrie disease. the deletion involves ndp, maoa, maob, efhc <dig> genes. in this case, epilepsy, not a common trait of norrie disease, is probably caused by the deletion of the efhc <dig> gene  <cit> .

patients with non-syndromic mental retardation
in  <dig> out of  <dig> patients, we identified genomic imbalances in regions, which included at least one gene related with mr . family studies supported the causal relationship with the mr phenotype observed in the index cases and demonstrated that the imbalance was inherited from an obligate carrier, except in case  <dig> 

case 3
case three was one of four mr siblings from healthy, consanguineous parents . the major clinical features were mild mental retardation, strabismus, hypogenitalism, a marked synophrys or medial eyebrow flare, a prominent nose and a broad high nasal root. acgh detected a deletion spanning two clones on xq <dig> affecting ophn <dig> gene . mlpa detected a deletion of exon  <dig> of this gene. the estimation of the altered size was achieved by pcr which revealed a deletion involving only exons  <dig> and  <dig>  the deletion fully segregates with the phenotype in the family. x-inactivation analysis showed a skewed x-inactivation pattern in the carrier mother  and not skewed in the carrier sister .

case 4
case  <dig> was a boy affected by mild mr, dyslexia and mild dysmorphic features. a duplication of approximately  <dig> mb was detected at xp <dig>  , affecting four genes . mlpa study detected duplication of rps6ka <dig> in the patient, one sister, mother and affected uncles . x-inactivation studies showed a random x-inactivation pattern in the mother .

case 5
this boy was born to healthy nonrelated parents at term. his psychomotor development was delayed with severe mr, generalized hypotonia, limited walking and speech delay. he has a family history of mr . he presented some mild facial dysmorphisms such as narrow forehead, thin nose, small mouth and marked dark rings under the eyes. acgh showed a duplication of at least  <dig> kb involving  <dig> genes at xq <dig> , including scl6a <dig> and mecp <dig> genes. specific mlpa for this region confirmed duplication of mecp <dig>  l1cam and irak <dig> genes in the patient and his mother.

case 6
this boy was diagnosed of mild mr with an iq of  <dig>  he was born at  <dig> months from non-consanguineous parents after a pregnancy affected by acute pancreatitis. he presented neonatal seizures and cyanotic crisis. he acquired sedestation at  <dig> months, deambulation at  <dig> months and speech at  <dig> months. he showed psychomotor delay and learning disabilities, microcephaly, hyperkinesias and other mild dysmorphic features such as medial eyebrow flare and deep palate. a duplication spaning  <dig> clones with an estimate size of  <dig> kb was identified at xq <dig> . mlpa confirmed duplication of gdi <dig>  flna and emd genes and discarded any alteration in the mecp <dig> gene in the patient, two affected relatives and two carrier women . rt-pcr studies revealed a significantly higher gdi <dig> expression in the patient and his affected uncle . the carrier mother showed a complete skewed x-inactivation  inactivating the x-chromosome inherited by the patient.

case 7
case  <dig> was a boy affected by moderate mr, and minor dysmorphic features. acgh detected a duplication of approximately  <dig> kb spanning the huwe <dig> gene and probably the phf <dig> gene at xp <dig>  . the development of mlpa custom probes for huwe <dig> and phf <dig> allowed confirmation of the duplication of huwe <dig> gene both in the patient and his affected brother  and discard implication of phf <dig> gene in the duplication. his mother was carrier of the duplication. x-inactivation pattern was skewed in the mother  and not skewed in the aunt . the screening of  <dig> normal male controls did not detect this cnv in any of them.

case 8
case  <dig> was a boy with moderate mental retardation and minor facial dysmorfisms. he has a family history of mr although no family members were available for study . a duplication of approximately 350kb, involving four clones on xq <dig> was identified by acgh . the duplication spans the eda2r gene that encodes a receptor of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. mlpa screening with custom probes for eda2r gene confirmed the duplication in the patient and discarded it in  <dig> male controls.

some other variations identified in xlmr patients correspond to previously reported cnvs present in the reference database of genomic variants  <cit> . the most common ones were deletions and reciprocal duplications in the xq <dig> and xq <dig>  regions of an average size of  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb, respectively. the proportion of patients carrying cnvs was double than that of controls . further description of the identified cnvs is provided in table  <dig>  in general xlmr patients presented more changes and duplications were more common in xlmr patients than in controls .

discussion
the applicability of the array-based comparative genomic hybridization technology to detect copy number changes in mentally delayed patients has been described in a number of previous reports. an incidence of cryptic imbalances in about 10–25% of the cases has been reported  <cit> . with the aim of identifying novel aberrations involved in the cognitive impairment in xlmr patients, we have developed a tiling path x chromosome array for cgh with a  <dig> kb resolution. clinically relevant imbalances were identified in  <dig> cases  with genomic sizes ranging between  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb. in all these cases we have identified genes related to mr that could be responsible for the phenotype in these patients . in cases  <dig> and  <dig>  array cgh supported the previous clinical suspicion and helped to roughly delineate the location of breakpoints for the different aberrations. in case  <dig>  the identification of an  <dig> kb deletion, affecting exons  <dig> and  <dig> of the ophn <dig> gene at xq <dig>  demonstrated the usefulness and accuracy of array cgh to detect small copy number changes. in cases  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> we identified duplication of rps6ka <dig>  mecp <dig>  and gdi <dig> genes, respectively, all of them implicated in mental retardation and neurological disease. mutations in rps6ka <dig> are responsible for the coffin-lowry syndrome and gdi <dig> has been related to nonsyndromic mr forms. as previously pointed out  <cit>  we propose that the copy number alteration of dosage sensitive genes rps6ka <dig> and gdi <dig> may be the major cause for the mental retardation in cases  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in fact, case  <dig> and related family members carrying the duplication at xq <dig> presented higher gdi <dig> mrna levels than controls. as far as we are aware, there is only other report describing duplications of rps6ka <dig> and gdi <dig> genes causing mr. froyen et al., described a boy with psychomotor delay with a small duplication of  <dig> mb in size involving the xlmr genes flna and gdi <dig>  among others  <cit> . in the same work, they also detected a duplication of  <dig> mb involving known mrx genes such as rps6ka <dig>  cdkl <dig> and nlgn4x in a patient affected by severe psychomotor delay. the detection in our series of two cases with smaller duplications involving gdi <dig> and rps6ka <dig> genes reinforces the idea that increased gene dosage of these genes may be related to abnormal cognitive impairment.

in cases  <dig> and  <dig> we detected duplications of regions in which no genes involved in mr have been described. in case  <dig>  the duplication at xp <dig>  was proximal but close to the mr related phf <dig> gene  <cit> . mlpa only confirmed duplication of huwe <dig> gene and although phf <dig> is not implicated in the duplication, it might be somehow influenced by this cnv. in case  <dig>  the duplication at xq <dig> was confirmed by mlpa of eda2r gene, which encodes a tumor necrosis factor receptor. although the imbalance was confirmed by other molecular method, no dna from the parents was available for genotyping and we could not establish the causativeness of the aberration in the observed phenotype. nevertheless, duplications of huwe <dig> and eda2r have not been detected upon screening  <dig> male controls neither have ever been reported as genomic polymorphisms, suggesting that these changes are not very common in the general population. nevertheless, further studies are needed in order to clarify their role in mr.

it has been shown that in several x-linked disorders, the x-inactivation process evidences a bias in mothers of affected individuals  <cit> . we have investigated the x-inactivation pattern in six female carriers. fifty per cent of them showed a skewed x-inactivation of the chromosome carrying the mutant allele, which is in agreement with the literature  <cit> . however we have to bear in mind that this inactivation pattern has been observed in blood samples and we do not know what is happening in other tissues.

until now among mentally retarded patients, deletions were the most commonly genomic aberrations identified. recently, the use of array technologies has led to the detection of new duplications in mentally retarded patients and the description of new syndromes, i.e. mecp <dig> duplication syndrome  <cit> . the identification of new cases harboring duplications in these genes should be of help in order to elucidate their potential involvement in xlmr.

the number of described cnvs in human genome is exponentially increasing due to the high number of genome wide analyses. nowadays there are reported more than  <dig> cnvs,  <dig> on the x-chromosome  <cit> . we described here seven different cnv regions in the x-chromosome . all these cnv regions overlap with others previously identified  <cit> , and all are associated with segmental duplications. one of the most common cnv both in xlmr patients and in control subjects is at xq <dig>  at approximately two mb from the telomere and associated to known segmental duplications. cnv regions and segmental duplications are not uniformly distributed throughout the genome, being significantly overrepresented in number within two mb of telomeres and centromeres  <cit> . this xq <dig> polymorphic region encompasses the opsin cluster, a family of genes involved in color perception. it has been previously reported that many genes involved in the senses such as olfactory receptors and opsins  associate with cnvs  <cit> . the second most common cnv in xlmr patients is at xq <dig> . this region is polymorphic in the general population  <cit>  and it contains several cancer-related genes such as sage and mage tumor antigen families. curiously, cnvs are more common in xlmr patients than in controls; i.e. 26% of patients were polymorphic for the xq <dig> region vs. 5% of controls. furthermore, the percentage of cnvs is statistically higher in xlmr than in controls . also the average size is higher of cnvs seems to be higher in patients than in controls . we still do not know the significance of some of these cnvs, i.e. they can influence expression of other genes. further characterization of these variable regions, including quantitative analyses, opens a new field of study that should assist to understand the role of this genomic variation in mental retardation.

CONCLUSIONS
the x chromosome acgh presented here has been proven successful for the detection of novel cnvs and characterization of known rearrangements in xlmr patients. even more we have detected some polymorphic cnv that seem to be more frequent in xlmr than in controls. further characterization of these variable regions, including quantitative analyses, opens a new field of study that should assist to understand the role of this genomic variation in mr.
