BACKGROUND
structure-based drug design is widely used to identify lead compounds with the growing availability of protein structures  <cit> . many tools  have been developed for virtual screening  and successfully identified lead compounds for some target proteins. however, the accuracy of these docking tools remained intensive because of the incomplete understandings of ligand binding mechanisms  <cit> . in addition, most of scoring functions are lack of pharmacological interactions that are essential for ligand binding or biological functions  <cit> . recently, some approaches have been proposed to derive pharmacological interactions from known compounds  <cit> . these approaches apparently increase hit rates for identifying the active compounds which are often similar to the known compounds. in addition, these approaches are often unable to be applied for new targets, which have no known active compounds.

generally, a vs procedure consists of four main steps: preparations of the target protein and the compound library, docking and post-screening analysis . most docking programs  only provide docked poses or loosely coupled these steps. they often provided limit ability for post-screening analysis. therefore, a vs framework, providing an easy-to-use graphic and integrated environment, is an emergent task for drug discovery.

to address these issues, we have developed a structure-based vs framework, named igemdock, from preparations through to post-screening analysis. igemdock is an integrated environment, which integrates the heavily modified and enhanced in-house tool gemdock, protein-ligand profiles, pharmacological interactions, and compound clusters. gemdock was comparative to several docking tools  and has been successfully applied to identify new inhibitors and new binding sites for some targets  <cit> . notably, igemdock derives the pharmacological interactions from screening compounds without using a set of known active compounds. the pharmacological interactions, which often form binding pockets with specific physico-chemical properties of the target protein, can represent conserved interactions between the interacting residues and the screening compounds. we initially validated the pharmacological interactions on three therapeutic protein targets, including estrogen receptor α for antagonists and agonists and thymidine kinase. our experimental results show that the derived pharmacological interactions are often essential for the ligand binding or maintaining biological functions for these targets. in addition, igemdock provided a post-screening analysis module, which is convenient for clustering compounds and visualizing the pharmacological interactions by interaction profiles. we believe that igemdock is useful for drug discovery and identifying essential residues and interactions for understanding the binding mechanisms.

methods
preparations of proteins and compound sets
to initially validate the pharmacological interactions, we selected three therapeutic protein targets, including estrogen receptor α for agonists , estrogen receptor α for antagonists , and thymidine kinase  because these proteins were well studied. the catalytic mechanisms, biological functions, key functional residues, and active compounds of the three targets were available in the literatures. estrogen receptor is an important therapeutic target for osteoporosis and breast cancer  <cit> , and tk is a drug target for the therapy of herpes simplex virus type- <dig>  <cit> . moreover, we also evaluate the docking and screening accuracy of igemdock. for docking, a highly diverse dataset comprising  <dig> protein-compound complexes  was selected; for screening, we prepared  <dig> known active compounds and  <dig> compounds were randomly selected from available chemical directory  proposed by bissantz et al. <cit>  for each therapeutic protein target.

main procedure
igemdock is an integrated vs environment from preparations through post-screening analysis with pharmacological interactions . first, igemdock provides interactive interfaces to prepare both the binding site of the target protein and the screening compound library . each compound in the library is then docked into the binding site by using the in-house docking tool gemdock  <cit> . subsequently, igemdock generates protein-compound interaction profiles of electrostatic , hydrogen-bonding , and van der waals  interactions. based on these profiles and compound structures, igemdock infers the pharmacological interactions and clusters the screening compounds for the post-screening analysis . finally, igemdock ranks and visualizes the screening compounds by combining the pharmacological interactions and energy-based scoring function of gemdock.

mining pharmacological interactions
igemdock mines the pharmacological interactions based on protein-compound interaction profiles . the size of each profile is n×2k where n and k are the numbers of screening compounds and interacting residues of the target protein, respectively. here, an interacting residue is divided into two interacting groups: main and side chains. a profile p with type i  is given as :  

where pi,j is a binary value  for the compound i interacting to the residue group j. in the e and h profiles, the pi,j is set to  <dig>  if hydrogen-bonding or electrostatic interactions are yielded between the compound i and the residue j ; otherwise, pi,j= <dig> . for the v profile, pi,j =  <dig> if the interacting energy is less than - <dig> kcal/mol .

after the generations of the profiles, we identified the pharmacological interactions. for each interacting residue group, the z-score value is used to measure the interaction conservation between the interacting groups and the screening compounds. for computing the z-scores of interacting groups in a profile,  <dig> randomly shuffled profiles are utilized to obtain the standard deviation  and mean . the z-score of the interacting residue group j is defined as , where fj is given as , where n is the number of screening compounds. finally, we normalize the z-score value as follows:   

where wj is the interaction conservation of the residue group j related to the largest z-score  among all of interacting groups in the binding site. here, an interaction conservation is viewed as a pharmacological preference and an interaction is considered as the pharmacological interaction if wj ≥ <dig> . for example, for the hydrogen profile of the target era, the pharmacological preferences of e <dig> and r <dig> are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively; for the v profile, the preferences of l <dig>  l <dig>  and f <dig> are  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively . in this case, over  <dig>  screening compounds form hydrogen bonds with the residues e <dig> or r <dig> by polar moieties , carboxyl group , sulfuric acid monoester , ketone , and phosphoric acid monoester ). moreover, the aromatic rings of the screening compounds are often sandwiched by vdw interacting residues l <dig>  l <dig>  and f <dig> .

based on the pharmacological interactions, we developed a pharmacological scoring function for identifying the active compounds from thousands of screening compounds. the pharmacological scoring function is given as   

where egemdock is the docked energy of gemdock and epharma, epharma, and epharma are the pharmacological scores of electrostatics, hydrogen-bonding, and vdw interactions, respectively. the epharma with interaction type i  is defined as  

where ej is the energy obtained by the gemdock scoring function for the residue group j. finally, igemdock provides the ranks of energy-based and pharmacological scoring functions for all screening compounds.

implementation of igemdock
igemdock is an easy-to-use vs environment and includes three main modules : docking and virtual screening tool ; post-screening analysis methods; and visualization tools . we employed era as an example to present these modules, procedures and features of igemdock.

for protein-ligand docking/screening module, igemdock provides an interactive interface for the preparations of the binding site and compound library; setting docking parameters; and monitoring progress status . for most docking tools, users usually need to prepare the binding site structure and compound library through complicated steps . here, igemdock provides a straightforward method to derive the binding site from the bounded ligand. for example, the binding site of era  was obtained from the estradiol . igemdock is able to automatically consider the effects of hydrogen atoms when preparing the binding site and the compound library. in addition, igemdock allows users to visualize and refine the binding site of the target protein. additionally, igemdock offers the similar way to prepare screening compounds and docking parameters .

after the screening process, igemdock utilizes the post-screening analysis module to infer pharmacological interactions and cluster screening compounds based on protein-ligand complexes and compound structures . first, igemdock generates interaction profiles and calculates the pharmacological preference  of each interacting group for deriving the pharmacological interactions . these pharmacological preferences and interactions are shown in an interactive window ; furthermore, rasmol displays the pharmacological interactions with conserved interacting residues and functional groups of compounds . additionally, igemdock supports a hierarchical clustering method to cluster screening compounds according to interaction profiles and the atomic composition . the atomic composition, which is similar to the amino acid composition of a protein sequence, is useful for measuring compound similarity. igemdock provides an interactive interface for visualizing compound similarity with a hierarchical tree by java treeview. finally, igemdock ranks and visualizes the screening compounds by combining the pharmacological interactions and the energy-based scoring function.

RESULTS
pharmacological interactions
the pharmacological interactions derived by igemdock are often involved in biological reactions or essential for ligand binding. we examined the pharmacological interactions on three selected target proteins . first, we compared the pharmacological interactions, derived from  <dig> screening compounds, to the consensus interactions, derived from  <dig> active compounds . here, the residue i is considered as "hot spot" if the consensus interaction ratio ≥ <dig>   <cit> . among  <dig> predicted pharmacological interactions  for era,  <dig> pharmacological interactions  agree with hot spots except the l <dig> with the hydrogen-bonding interaction. for tk,  <dig> of  <dig> pharmacological interactions  are the hot spots. these results indicate the pharmacological interactions  from screening compounds are often essential for the ligand binding. for example,  <dig> active compounds of tk form stacking interactions with the residue y <dig> ) that stabilizes the binding of thymine or purine moieties.

a the consensus interaction ratio of the residue i is defined as aj/a, where aj is the number of active compounds interacting to the residue i and a is total number of active compounds.

b h, e and v are the interaction types.

c the pharmacological preferences ).

we also examined the pharmacological interactions by their biological functions or binding mechanisms. for estrogen receptor α, h <dig>  is involved in a hydrogen-bonding network  <cit> ; similarly, e <dig> and r <dig>  interact the structural water to form the hydrogen bonding network   <cit> . these two hydrogen bonding networks are essential for estrogen receptor modulators to trigger the responses of estrogen receptor α <cit> . for er and era, hydrophobic interacting residues, l <dig>  l <dig>  f <dig>  and l <dig> with high vdw interaction preferences, contact with the sterols or flavones scaffolds of the active compounds. these residues contribute the major vdw interactions for the ligand binding of estrogen receptor α  <cit> .

for tk, r <dig> and r <dig> play major roles for inhibitor and substrate binding  <cit> , and their hydrogen-bonding preferences are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . our method identified the electrostatic interactions of r <dig> and r <dig> , which help to transfer phosphate in the substrate phosphorylation  <cit> . however, these two electrostatic interactions are not observed from  <dig> active compounds . for the residue q <dig> , the tk activity was decreased over 90% if q <dig> mutated into asp, glu, or asn  <cit> . the residues m <dig>  y <dig>  h <dig>  r <dig>  and y <dig> constitute a pocket to fix the substrate, and their vdw preferences are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively . for the substrate binding, m <dig> and y <dig> sandwich the thymine moiety and w <dig> is a part of the quasi-helical motif  <cit> . these results demonstrated that the pharmacological interactions derived by igemdock are often involved in the biological functions and the ligand binding.

molecular docking and virtual screening
to initially evaluate the utility of igemdock for docking and virtual screening, we selected a highly diverse dataset with  <dig> protein-ligand complexes  and era, er, and tk with  <dig> compounds as test sets. please note that the docking and screening tool of igemdock is gemdock which was well-studied for vs and some applications  <cit> . in order to compare with previous works, we followed the docking procedures and performance indices proposed by nissink, et al. a docked result was considered as a success solution if the root-mean-square derivation  ≤ <dig>  Å between the docked solutions and x-ray crystal structures. for these  <dig> complexes, the success rates of igemdock and gold are 78% and 68%, respectively .

the pharmacological scoring function was then applied to identify the active compounds from the  <dig> compounds of era, er, and tk. furthermore, we compared the screening results with those of using the energy-based scoring function of gemdock. these two approaches were tested on the same datasets. the true hits of the three testing sets were used to access the screening accuracy of the two approaches . the screening accuracy was generally improved when igemdock considered the pharmacological interactions.

we compared igemdock  with three screening methods  on the er and tk sets . to compare with previous works, we followed the experiment design and performance indices used by bissantz et al. when true-positive rate is 80%, the false positive rates were  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> % , for er. the false positive rates were  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  for tk.

post-screening analysis
to identify leads from vast amount of docked poses generated during the virtual screening procedure is the key step for the drug discovery. in addition, the top-ranked compounds based on the scoring functions are not advisable since these compounds may be similar in structures or physico-chemical properties. for these two issues, igemdock provides a post-screening analysis module to cluster compounds based on the interactions profiles and the atomic compositions. selecting representative compounds from each cluster is able to maintain compound diversity and then reduces the false positives. further, when active compounds are available, users can choose the similar compounds in the same cluster of the actives based on hierarchical trees . notably, igemdock visualizes the interaction profiles of the compounds, and thereby the top-ranked compounds with pharmacological interactions can be selected according to the interaction table .

the post-screening analysis module of igemdock is useful for clustering and selecting compounds based on interaction profiles. we selected a set of compounds, including  <dig> era active compounds and top-ranked  <dig> compounds based on both the pharmacological and energy-based scoring functions. the hierarchical clustering dendrogram and the profile revealed that the protein-ligand interactions derived from the pharmacological scoring function are significantly different from those derived from the energy-based scoring function . the compounds with the high pharmacological scores and the active compounds consistently keep the pharmacological interactions; conversely, the compounds derived from the energy-based scoring function are often lack of the pharmacological interactions . this result indicates the pharmacological interactions are useful for identifying active compounds. for example, the two active compounds, era_ <dig> and era_ <dig>  were ranked as  <dig> and  <dig> using the energy-based scoring function, respectively. when the pharmacological interactions were considered, the ranks of era_ <dig> and era_ <dig> were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively .

some compounds having high pharmacological scores are structurally and chemically similar to the active compounds . for example, mfcd <dig>  and mfcd <dig>  were analogues of the era active compounds, and both of them were clustered into the same cluster. in addition, the pharmacological scoring function can reduce the ill-effect of most energy-based scoring functions which often favor high molecular weight or highly-polar compounds  <cit> . for instance, the ranks of two high molecular weight and polar compounds, mfcd <dig> and mfcd <dig>  are  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . to further examine the pharmacological scoring function, we analyzed the relationship between the molecular weights of the active compounds and the rank improvement using the pharmacological scoring function . the pharmacological scoring function generally improves the screening accuracy when the molecular weights of the active compounds are less than  <dig> 

in summary, igemdock can mine the pharmacological interactions from the screening compounds without known active compounds. therefore, igemdock can provide a good starting point for deriving pharmacological interactions  and identifying new potential active compounds for a new protein structure. in addition, igemdock offers the visualization of the interaction profiles, pharmacological interactions, and the hierarchical clustering dendrogram. users are able to easily observe and select compounds for post-screening analysis to enrich accuracies.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a structure-based vs framework igemdock from the preparations through to the post-screening analysis. igemdock is an integrated and easy-to-use environment which is especially useful for post-screening analysis and inferring pharmacological interactions from screening compounds. the friendly user interface is helpful to biologically oriented nonexperts. the experimental results show that the pharmacological interactions are often essential for the binding of the active compounds and involved in biological mechanisms. the pharmacological interactions can reduce the ill effects of energy-based scoring functions to enrich the hit rates in vs. we believe igemdock is useful for drug discovery and understanding protein-ligand mechanisms.
