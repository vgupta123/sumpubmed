BACKGROUND
all plastids trace their origins to a primary endosymbiotic event in which a previously nonphotosynthetic protist engulfed and enslaved a cyanobacterium. over time, most of the genes once present in the endosymbiont have been lost or transferred to the host nuclear genome; those nuclear-encoded proteins used by the plastid are translated by the host and targeted back into the organelle to express their functions  <cit> . consistent with this scenario, plastids are never synthesized de novo and they cannot multiply independently. their continuity is maintained by the division of preexisting plastids, which is performed and controlled by proteins encoded in the nuclear genome  <cit> .

consistent with the endosymbiotic origin of plastids, molecular genetic studies in a. thaliana have defined several nucleus-encoded homologs of cyanobacterial cell division proteins that function in plastid division in photosynthetic eukaryotes  <cit> . plastid division requires assembly of ftsz <dig> and ftsz <dig>  homologs of the tubulin-like bacterial protein ftsz, into a ring structure at the midplastid division site  <cit> . the ftsz ring is localized to the midplastid through the activities of mind and mine  <cit>  and is thought to be stabilized by the j-domain-like protein arc <dig>  <cit> . mutations in several other cyanobacteria-derived genes, such as giant chloroplast  <dig>  <cit>  and crumpled leaf  <cit> , also cause defects in plastid division, although their roles in the division process are still not known.

plant-specific proteins  also regulate chloroplast division  <cit> . division involves the assembly and constriction of the endosymbiont-derived ftsz ring on the stromal surface of the inner envelope membrane and the plant-specific dynamin ring on the cytosolic surface of the outer envelope membrane. this coordination is mediated by the outer envelope spanning proteins pdv <dig> and pdv <dig>  and inner envelope spanning protein arc <dig>  <cit> . as above, recent studies identified several additional components of the plastid division machinery. however, several other proteins that are involved in bacterial cell division  <cit>  are not found in plants, and there are still unidentified arc  loci that impair chloroplast division in a. thaliana  <cit> , suggesting that there are still unidentified components of the plastid division machinery. in order to identify new plastid division proteins, we are using forward genetics approaches.

by characterizing plastid division mutants, we found that the cyanobacteria-derived chaperonin proteins ptcpn60α and ptcpn60β are required for proper plastid division in a. thaliana. the a. thaliana genome encodes several members of the ptcpn60α and ptcpn60β families and our analyses suggest that at least two ptcpn60β proteins have redundant functions. moderate reduction of ptcpn60β protein levels impaired plastid division while severe loss abolished greening of plastids, suggesting that the level of ptcpn60β is important for proper plastid division. since chaperonin proteins have been shown to be required for assembly of the division apparatus in bacteria  <cit> , their activities in the division machinery are conserved between bacteria and plastids.

RESULTS
mutations in ptcpn60α and ptcpn60β impair plastid division
in order to find new proteins required for plastid division, we screened  <dig>  a. thaliana activation tagging lines  <cit> . by microscopic observation of leaf cell chloroplasts, we found twenty-five mutant lines with chloroplasts that were significantly altered in number and size within single cells as compared with those in the wild type  <cit> . among these mutants, one line, br <dig>  which contained enlarged chloroplasts, was characterized in this study . the growth of br <dig> was slightly slower than that of the wild type while the mutant plants were fertile. all the f <dig> progeny, after crossing br <dig> with wild type, displayed normal chloroplast morphology. in f <dig> progeny, the chloroplast-division phenotype segregated in approximately a 3: <dig> ratio . these results indicated that the chloroplast-division phenotype of br <dig> is recessive and that the phenotype is caused by a mutation in a single genomic locus.

because the t-dna insertion in br <dig> did not co-segregate with the mutant phenotype in the f <dig> population, we identified the mutation by map-based cloning. br <dig> bears a single nucleotide insertion in at1g <dig>  which encodes a plastid chaperonin 60β  . the nucleotide insertion produced a premature stop codon in the second exon . to confirm that the mutation in at1g <dig> is linked to the chloroplast-division phenotype, we observed another t-dna insertion mutant in the same gene . the mutant displayed a chloroplast-division defect similar to that of br <dig> . because two independent mutant alleles of at1g <dig> showed chloroplast division defects, we conclude that at1g <dig> is identical to br <dig> and is required for plastid division.

supporting the above relationship between ptcpn60β and plastid division, map-based cloning of the previously isolated chloroplast division mutant arc <dig>  <cit>  revealed a mutation in at2g <dig>  which encodes ptcpn60α. leaf mesophyll cells in arc <dig> mutants contain fewer and larger chloroplasts than those in wild type cells , similar to br <dig>  the arc <dig> mutation bears a single nucleotide substitution, which converts ala- <dig> to val in at2g <dig> . in addition, a genomic copy of at2g <dig> complemented the chloroplast-division defect in arc <dig> , indicating that arc <dig> is identical to at2g <dig>  these results indicate that ptcpn60α as well as ptcpn60β proteins are required for normal plastid division.

moderate reduction of ptcpn60α or ptcpn60β activity causes defects in chloroplast division while severe reduction abolishes greening
a previous study showed that a t-dna insertion null mutant of ptcpn60α  had a defect in embryo development and greening of plastids  <cit> . in contrast, arc <dig>  a missense allele, germinated normally, though it showed a dwarf phenotype later in development. br <dig>  also germinated normally, consistent with previous observations of another null allele of at1g <dig>  lesion initiation  <dig>   <cit> . although leaves of len <dig> had wrinkled irregular surfaces and displayed lesion formation under short-day conditions, under long-day conditions similar to those used throughout our study, these phenotypes were not observed and the plants showed a dwarf phenotype similar to that of br <dig>  <cit> . we hypothesized that the differences in phenotypes resulted from remnant ptcpn60α activity in the case of arc <dig> and redundant ptcpn60β proteins in the case of br <dig> 

to address the above possibilities, we first analyzed ptcpn <dig> proteins in a. thaliana by phylogenetic analyses. the results showed monophyly of six a. thaliana proteins with cyanobacterial chaperonin  <dig> proteins . of these, two proteins, including at2g <dig>  were grouped as ptcpn60α , and four proteins, including at1g <dig>  were grouped as ptcpn60β . these results are consistent with a previous classification  <cit> . further, our phylogenetic analyses indicated that there are two types of cyanobacterial chaperonin  <dig> proteins, groel- <dig> and groel- <dig>  and that only one group, groel- <dig>  gave rise to ptcpn60α and ptcpn60β in land plants and green algae .

next, we compared the phenotypes of arc <dig>  and a t-dna insertion mutant  of ptcpn60α <dig>  . in contrast to arc <dig>  seedlings of the insertion mutant exhibit an albino phenotype and the growth of this mutant was severely suppressed , similar to that of schlepperless, another t-dna insertion null allele  <cit> . by microscopy, we observed small and colourless plastid-like organelles in leaf cells, but no developed chloroplasts . when a genomic fragment bearing the ptcpn60α <dig>  gene was introduced into the mutant, the phenotype was complemented . these results indicate that loss of ptcpn60α <dig> abolishes greening of plastids. in support of this conclusion, the amount of chlorophyll extracted from true leaves of arc <dig> was less than that of wild type , although the arc <dig> cells contained green chloroplasts that showed defects in division . the above observations of two ptcpn60α <dig> mutants suggest that complete loss of ptcpn60α <dig> activity fully abolishes greening of plastids while the weaker arc <dig> allele, though probably retaining residual activity of ptcpn60α <dig>  still confers chloroplast division defects.

we addressed possible functional redundancy among ptcpn60β proteins. the phylogenetic analyses showed that ptcpn60β <dig>  has the closest evolutionary relationship with ptcpn60β <dig>   and a blast search showed 92% identity between the two amino acid sequences. in order to assess whether ptcpn60β <dig> protein is also required for plastid division and/or plastid development and whether the functions of ptcpn60β <dig> and ptcpn60β <dig> proteins are redundant, we observed a t-dna insertion mutant of ptcpn60β <dig> . although the mutant did not exhibit plastid division or embryo development defects , the ptcpn60β1- <dig>  ptcpn60β <dig>  double mutant exhibited small, albino seedlings , similar to the ptcpn60α <dig> t-dna mutant . since the ptcpn60β1- <dig>  and ptcpn60β <dig>  single mutants did not show the albino phenotype , the above results indicate that ptcpn60β <dig> and ptcpn60β <dig> are redundant.

to further examine the redundancy between the two ptcpn60β proteins with regard to plastid division and greening, we observed all possible combinations of the ptcpn60β1- <dig> and ptcpn60β <dig> mutations  . all combinations except the double homozygote germinated normally , while leaf chlorophyll content was reduced depending on the number of mutant alleles .

similar to the chlorophyll content, the plastid division defect was dependent on the number of mutant alleles . other than the double homozygous mutant, all combinations containing the ptcpn60β1- <dig> homozygous mutation  and the combination of the ptcpn60β1- <dig> heterozygous mutation and ptcpn60β <dig> homozygous mutation  showed a large-chloroplast phenotype, while the size and number of chloroplasts were normal in other combinations . these results suggest that ptcpn60β <dig> and ptcpn60β <dig> have redundant functions in plastid division. similarly to ptcpn60α , severe mutation of ptcpn60β fully abolishes greening of plastids. in contrast, weaker mutations in ptcpn60β partially affect greening while chloroplast division is defective even under these conditions.

ptcpn60α and ptcpn60β are required for proper ftsz ring formation
to confirm the reduction of ptcpn60β proteins in ptcpn60β mutants and further examine localization of the proteins, we prepared antibodies using recombinant ptcpn60β <dig>  on immunoblots, the antibodies detected a single band of ~ <dig> kda, close to the predicted size of the ptcpn60β proteins . when the same amount of total protein extracted from whole plants was examined, the intensity of the band was reduced in the ptcpn60β1- <dig> mutant  relative to that in the wild type. however, a residual band was detected, similar to a previous report that anti-spinach ptcpn60β antibodies recognized residual ptcpn60β in the ptcpn60β1- <dig> mutant   <cit> . the intensity of the residual band was further reduced in the ptcpn60β1- <dig> ptcpn60β <dig> double mutant , suggesting that the antibodies recognize both ptcpn60β <dig> and ptcpn60β <dig>  and confirming reduction of total ptcpn60β protein level in these mutants. since the antibodies still detected a faint band at the same position on the gel in the double mutant , they may also recognize ptcpn60β <dig> and/or ptcpn60β <dig>  in the immunoblot analysis, there was little difference in the intensity of the band between wild type and ptcpn60β <dig>  this is probably because the ptcpn60β <dig> protein level is lower than the levels of the other ptcpn60β proteins, as suggested by rt-pcr analyses showing that the ptcpn60β <dig> transcript level is lower than that of ptcpn60β <dig> .

in contrast to the reduction of ptcpn60β, levels of ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase  large subunit and ftsz2- <dig> were not altered in the ptcpn60β mutants . in addition, the size of ftsz2- <dig> in the mutant was the same as that of mature protein in the wild type. these results indicate that nucleus-encoded ftsz2- <dig> is properly imported into the plastids and processed in the ptcpn60β mutants.

in order to examine the relationship between ptcpn <dig> proteins and chloroplast division, we first examined the localization of ptcpn60β by immunofluorescence microscopy using the anti-ptcpn60β antibodies in the wild type. the fluorescence signal was detected specifically in chloroplasts but was not detected by preimmune antisera or secondary antibodies alone . the fluorescence signal detected by the antibodies was spattered throughout the chloroplasts and no specific localization at the division site was observed .

to assess how ptcpn <dig> mutations affect the chloroplast division machinery, we examined the localization of the chloroplast division ftsz proteins in the ptcpn60α1- <dig> and ptcpn60β1- <dig> mutants by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-atftsz2- <dig> antibodies. in the wild type, ftsz2- <dig> localizes in a single ring at the chloroplast division site as reported previously . in contrast, the enlarged chloroplasts in both the ptcpn60β1- <dig>  and ptcpn60α1- <dig>  mutants contained abnormally long, disordered ftsz filaments , indicating that ftsz ring formation is perturbed in both mutants.

discussion
in this study, we showed that both ptcpn60α and ptcpn60β are required for plastid division as well as for greening of plastids. the results also indicate that the mutant phenotypes vary depending on the severity of the mutations. in addition to defects in plastid division, ptcpn <dig> mutants exhibited dwarfed or other developmental defects  <cit>  . a similar situation was observed in the crumpled leaf  mutant, which also showed both plastid division defects and abnormal development  <cit> . because both ptcpn <dig> and crl  <cit>  function in chloroplasts and, in our screening, several mutant plants that showed abnormal morphology contained chloroplasts of normal size, it is unlikely that the developmental defects are the cause of the observed chloroplast division defects.

chaperonins are evolutionarily conserved molecular chaperones found in bacteria , mitochondria and plastids. the structure and mechanisms of chaperonin function have been well studied mainly using the chaperonin of escherichia coli, groe  <cit> . the groe chaperonin functions as a large complex consisting of multiple 60-kd groel and 10-kd groes subunits  <cit> . although in vitro studies have clarified the mechanism of groel as a molecular chaperone, the in vivo roles are poorly understood. groe is essential for the viability of e. coli  <cit>  and this is partly because groe is required for cell wall synthesis. in addition to the cell lysis phenotype of groe-depleted e. coli, it has been reported that cells with impaired groe exhibit filamentous cell morphology owing to defects in cell division  <cit> . the filamentous phenotypes were also observed in groe-depleted caulobacter crescentus and streptococcus mutans, suggesting that groe plays a universal role in cell division in bacteria  <cit> .

plastid cpn <dig> proteins are homologs of bacterial groel and phylogenetic studies indicate that plant cpn <dig> proteins evolved from groel proteins in the cyanobacterial ancestor of plastids . previous studies showed that depletion of ptcpn <dig> proteins in a. thaliana results in abnormal development of embryos and plastids  <cit>  and cell death in some growth conditions  <cit> . although severe mutations in ptcpn <dig> genes resulted in albino and dwarf seedlings, we found that weaker mutations confer defects in plastid division. even though plastid chaperonins are expected to be involved in several processes occurring in plastids as are bacterial chaperonins, our results suggest that one of the roles of the chaperonins is related to plastid division and that the role in division is conserved between bacteria and plastids. it is also known that plastid chaperonins are different from e. coli groe in that plastids contain two distinct proteins, ptcpn60α and ptcpn60β, both of which are expressed in all tissues  <cit> . despite the difference, our results showed that both ptcpn60α and ptcpn60β are required for plastid division.

in our analyses, depletion of ptcpn <dig> proteins did not alter the level of plastid ftsz. the size of the ftsz protein in the mutants was the same as that in wild type, indicating that the transit peptide was cleaved and the protein was imported into plastids. both in e. coli  <cit>  and a. thaliana chloroplasts , normal ftsz ring formation is impaired in the respective chaperonin mutants even though ftsz protein levels are normal . these results suggest that ptcpn <dig> proteins are not required for import of plastid division proteins into plastids. rather, it is suggested that ptcpn60s are required for assembly and/or maintenance of the plastid division apparatus after import of the components into plastids  <cit> . however, the mechanistic basis of the chloroplast division defect remains unclear. the abnormally long, disorganized ftsz filaments observed in the ptcpn <dig> mutants resemble the reported ftsz <dig> localization patterns in an ftsz <dig> null mutant  <cit> , an ftsz <dig> antisense line  <cit> , and in a line overexpressing arc <dig>  which functions in part to stabilize ftsz polymers  <cit> . the ptcpn <dig> ftsz morphologies are distinct from those observed in mind  <cit>  , mine  <cit> , arc <dig>  <cit>  , pdv <dig>  pdv <dig> and arc <dig>  <cit>   mutants. the mutant phenotypes suggest that reduced ptcpn <dig> levels result in excessively stable ftsz filaments, though whether this is through a direct effect on ftsz or a regulator of ftsz assembly, and whether the effects result from misfolding of some proteins in the mutant backgrounds or loss of another activity of ptcpn <dig>  remain to be determined. whatever the mechanism, the results provided evidence of a role for the ptcpn <dig> chaperone system in the regulation of ftsz polymer dynamics in vivo.

we compared the effects of several combinations of ptcpn60β alleles. the appearance of the chloroplast division phenotype depends on the number of disrupted alleles of ptcpn60β. for example, chloroplast size and number in the ptcpn60β1- <dig> heterozygote and ptcpn60β <dig> homozygote were normal, but combining these alleles  impaired chloroplast division . the lack of an obvious phenotype in ptcpn60β <dig> is probably because the level of total ptcpn60β decreased little in this mutant . the results suggest that ptcpn60β <dig> and ptcpn60β <dig> have redundant functions and that the plastid division defects in the ptcpn60β mutants are due to decreased ptcpn60β dosage. thus far, several plastid division proteins of cyanobacterial origin, such as ftsz, mind, mine, arc <dig>  and gc <dig>  were identified  <cit> . studies showing that the stoichiometry among these proteins is tightly maintained in plants  <cit>  and that moderate loss or overexpression of ftsz, mind and mine impairs plastid division  <cit>  suggest that normal plastid division requires the presence of the proper stoichiometric relationship among plastid division proteins. the observed defects in plastid division in a series of ptcpn60β mutants even in the presence of wild type ptcpn60β alleles  may reflect disruption of the stoichiometric relationship of functional plastid division proteins due to misfolding in the mutants after import from the cytosol.

studies using e. coli showed preferential localization of a population of groel at division sites by immunofluorescence labelling  <cit> . in our immunofluorescence analyses, however, ptcpn60β proteins are spattered throughout the chloroplasts of a. thaliana and we could not observe predominant localization of the protein at the division site. this observation is perhaps because of the existence of several chloroplast proteins which require cpn <dig> proteins for their folding. in fact, many proteins other than division proteins have been identified as possible targets of bacterial groel as below. despite of this observation, it is still possible that a portion of the ptcpn <dig> pool interacts with the plastid division machinery. a study in e. coli further suggested that the division protein ftse is a target substrate of the groe system  <cit> . in contrast, ftse is missing in plant and algal genomes  <cit> , suggesting that the plastid cpn <dig> system targets a different plastid division substrate. proteome-based analyses in e. coli identified ~ <dig> proteins that interact with groe, including the cell division proteins ftse, ftsa, ftsi, and ftsz  <cit>  although groe-dependent folding of ftsa, ftsi, and ftsz has not been examined. of these, only ftsz is conserved in plant genomes, raising the possibility that ftsz might be a target of cpn <dig> in the plastid.

several other molecular chaperone proteins have been shown to function in plastids, such as hsp <dig>  <cit>  and hsp <dig>  <cit> , but there is limited information about their substrates  <cit> . although it is known that functional specificity of hsp <dig> is mediated by specialized co-chaperones, how and what kinds of proteins groe/cpn <dig> recognize in vivo is little understood  <cit> . further studies on the interaction between groel and plastid division proteins in vivo, such as co-immunoprecipitation and fret analyses, would shed light on the role of ptcpn <dig> in the assembly and/or maintenance of the plastid division machinery.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that cyanobacteria-derived ptcpn60α and ptcpn60β proteins are required for plastid division. ftsz ring formation in plastids, but not import of ftsz into the plastids, was perturbed in ptcpn60a and ptcpn60β mutants, suggesting that ptcpn <dig> proteins are required for assembly of the cyanobacteria-derived part of the plastid division machinery subsequent to import of plastid division proteins, all of which are encoded in the nucleus. although plants have several members of the ptcpn60α and ptcpn60β family, we found that moderate reduction of ptcpn <dig> level results in impaired plastid division and reduction of chlorophylls. the results suggest the existence of mechanisms that regulate the levels of the ptcpn <dig> family of proteins in plastids.
