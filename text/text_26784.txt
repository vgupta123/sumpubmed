BACKGROUND
isatis indigotica fort. is one of the most commonly used plants in traditional chinese medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities  <cit> . its leaves are called “daqingye” , which can be used for the treatment of high fever, epidemic parotitis, pharyngitis and erysipelas. the root of i. indigotica is the well-known chinese medicine “banlangen” , which is widely used for flu and infections of the upper respiratory tract in china. during the epidemic period of severe acute respiratory syndromes  in  <dig>  banlangen demonstrated the potential prevention of sars  <cit> . however, the antiviral compounds of i. indigotica were still unknown until li  <cit>  learned that lariciresinol isolated from this plant was useful for the treatment of influenza a <dig> virus.

lariciresinol is a kind of lignan which has been widely studied and reported to possess a number of biological activities, including antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-estrogenic properties, which may reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, as well as certain types of cancer . the precursor of lariciresinol is pinoresinol, which comes from e-coniferyl alcohol by the action of dirigent proteins   <cit> .

dirigent  proteins are members of a large family which imparts stereoselectivity on the phenoxy radical-coupling reaction. these proteins can capture e-coniferyl alcohol  derived free-radical intermediates and orientate these radicals in such a way as to enable 8-8’ coupling with concomitant intramolecular cyclization to afford optically active - or -pinoresinol . in the absence of dir proteins, only non-specific radical-radical coupling occurs at the 8-8’, 8-5’, or 8-o-4’ positions with the resulting formation of racemic lignan products .

dir proteins exist in almost every vascular plant  <cit> . ralph and coworkers  <cit>  suggest that the dir proteins are subdivided into five groups: the dir-a, dir-b, dir-c, dir-d and dir-e subfamilies. with the increasing numbers of dir proteins, the dir-b and dir-d subfamilies are combined together with the appearance of the dir-f and dir-g subfamilies  <cit> . however, only members of dir-a subfamily are being studied for their biochemical functions; the other proteins are referred to as dir-like proteins. the dir and dir-like protein gene family in i. indigotica has not been analyzed in detail yet. under the umbrella of a transcription profiling of i. indigotica <cit> ,  <dig> full-length iidirs  are mined analytically through bioinformatics. here we report an inventory and sequence analysis as well as the phylogenetic relationships of the iidir gene family. a detailed quantitative real-time pcr expression analysis in constitutive i. indigotica tissues is described for  <dig> iidirs. finally, we provide a transcriptome analysis of iidirs, which is based on data treated with meja at different time points.

RESULTS
discovery of iidirs from the i. indigotica transcription profiling database
using tblastn and blastn  against the i. indigotica transcription profiling database with released dir and dir-like protein sequences, we obtained  <dig> putative iidir sequences . the best hit homology genes of these  <dig> sequences were summarized in additional file  <dig>  the number and subfamily designation of the iidir genes were based on the topology of the  <dig> iidirs with other  <dig> dirs according to ralph  <cit>  and arasan  <cit> . typical dirigent domains were found in these  <dig> iidir protein sequences though simple modular architecture research tool   <cit>  .

sequences analysis
the length of the predicted open reading frames  for the  <dig> cdnas ranged from  <dig> aa  to  <dig> aa . the  <dig> iidirs had predicted molecular masses range from circa  <dig>   to  <dig>   kda and predicted pi values range from  <dig>   to  <dig>   .

using the targetp  <dig>  server   <cit>  and the wolf psort   <cit>  subcellular localization software, it was predicted that most of the  <dig> iidirs were targeted to the secretory pathway, either through the default pathway for extracellular release, or for possible final localization in the vacuolar, chloroplast and cytoplasmic locations. the signal peptide prediction showed that most of the iidirs had a 20– <dig> aa length signal peptide at the n-terminus except iidir <dig>  iidir <dig>  and iidir <dig>  all iidirs except iidir12/13/14/15/16/ <dig> were found to contain n-glycosylation sites  which were a feature of secreted proteins using netnglyc  <dig>  server   <cit>  . the smart results showed that iidir3/4/12/13/14/15/17/ <dig> had transmembrane region. the molecular formula was calculated through protparam   <cit> . it found out that, the gene with the most sulfur elements was iidir <dig> , while iidir <dig> and iidir <dig> only had three sulfur elements, respectively .

pairwise sequence similarities among predicted amino acids of the <dig> iidirs ranged from a low of  <dig> % identity  to a high of  <dig> %  . iidir <dig> and iidir <dig> were an example of closely related proteins sharing amino acid identity greater than 98% that may represent within-species alleles.table  <dig>

results from pairwise amino acid sequence comparisons, using complete open reading frames, show as percent identity among members of the dir-a, dir-b/d and dir-e subfamilies. comparisons within the subfamily are printed as normal, whereas comparisons between proteins of the subfamilies dir-a and dir-b/d, dir-a and dir-e, and dir-b/d and dir-e are highlighted in italic, underline, and bold, respectively.



secondary structures of iidirs
additional file  <dig> presented the secondary structures polygrams of the  <dig> iidirs. they were predicted by netsurfp   <cit> . the  <dig> iidir proteins could be divided into several groups according to their secondary structures. the differences among all the iidirs were existing in the residues before the first β-strand. according to this shape, iidir16/17/18/ <dig> were far away from iidir <dig> to iidir <dig>  in the first  <dig> iidirs, iidir13/14/ <dig> were different from others at the shape of region between the first β-strand and the second β-strand. iidir <dig> was different from others at the last shape of β-strand. iidir1/2/3/4/were different from other iidirs because they had a smooth coil curve before the first β-strand.

to confirm the forecast accuracy of netsurfp, predictions of the secondary structures were also carried out on psipred  and phyre <dig>   <cit> . the position of the β-strands was in overall agreement with the predictions determined by netsurfp .

tertiary structures and homologs of iidirs
figure  <dig> showed predicted three-dimensional structures of  <dig> iidir proteins. structures of the  <dig> proteins were modeled using the server: http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/html/page.cgi?id=index <cit> . for all of the <dig> queried sequences, the same three top-scoring proteins were found, all of which belong to the allene oxide cyclase-like protein  family. aoc barrel-like protein d2brja <dig>  which shared only 17–26% sequence identity among the iidirs, was predicted as a dir homolog with about 98% probability, followed by two hypothetical proteins with similar probabilities . among the highest confidence level predicted by phyre <dig>  iidir <dig> and iidir <dig> showed the highest confidence of  <dig> % respectively with the template d2brja <dig> figure  <dig>

phylogenetic analysis of the iidirs
to obtain clues about the evolutionary relationships and the topological structures of the iidirs, multiple sequence alignments of amino acid sequences of the  <dig> full-length cdnas were used to build a neighbor-joining  tree with  <dig> bootstrap reconstruction and completed deletion gaps/missing data treatment . the  <dig> iidirs were clearly separated into three distinct groups based on sequence relatedness. the amino acid sequences of iidir1/2/3/ <dig> were clustered into group  <dig>  while iidir5/6/7/8/9/10/ <dig> were clustered into the second group. these two groups were in accordance with the secondary structures. iidir13/14/15/16/17/18/ <dig> were clustered into another group. iidir  <dig> was left behind between group  <dig> and other iidirs.figure  <dig>

dirs. the values on the branches are bootstrap proportions, which indicated the percentage values for obtaining this particular branching in  <dig> repetitions of the analysis. the lengths of branches are proportional to evolutionary distances between species.



to test the reliability of the nj tree, a maximum likelihood  analysis was also carried out to generate a phylogenetic tree using default parameters and  <dig> bootstrap reconstruction as well . both of the two trees had similar topological structures with three clusters, which indicated that the two methods were in good agreement.

to better understand dir and dir-like protein sequences divergences and similarities among i. indigotica and other plants, a provisional molecular phylogenetic tree was constructed using multiple sequence alignment from various plant species. these gene sequences were as follows:  <dig> genes from brassica rapa,  <dig> genes from arabidopsis thaliana,  <dig> genes from oryza sativa,  <dig> genes from spruce,  <dig> genes from thuja plicata, and an additional  <dig> dirs identified from a variety of species, including pea, cotton, corn, sesame, etc.  <cit> . in this tree, different subfamilies according to ralph  <cit>  were colored in different colors. however, only dir-a, dir-c and dir-f subfamilies were clustered separately. dir-e and dir-b/d subfamilies were mixed with genes from dir-g subfamily. these dir-g subfamily genes were all from b. rapa. the phylogenetic tree indicated that iidirs cluster into three groups, dir-a, dir-b/d and dir-e . iidir1/2/3/ <dig> grouped into subfamily dir-a, along with  <dig> a. thaliana genes and  <dig> b. rapa genes. iidir5/6/7/8/9/10/ <dig> grouped into subfamily dir-b/d, along with  <dig> a. thaliana genes and  <dig> b. rapa genes. iidir13/14/15/16/17/18/ <dig> grouped into subfamily dir-e, along with  <dig> a. thaliana genes and mixed with  <dig> brdirs from dir-g subfamily. iidir  <dig> was outside the subfamily dir-e. we designated it to subfamily dir-e.figure  <dig>

sequence comparison
the iidir sequences were analyzed to address if any putative functions could be inferred. the topology analyses of the iidirs showed that they contribute to dir-a, dir-b/d, and dir-e subfamilies. recent studies only focused on the function of the dir-a subfamily, classifying the other dirs from the other subfamilies to be the dir-like proteins. according to pickel  <cit> , atdir <dig> and atdir <dig> from dir-a subfamily of a. thaliana were different from those dirs found earlier, such as fidir <dig> and tpdir <dig>  <cit> . the first dir from forsythia suspensa was found to guide e-coniferyl alcohol to form -pinoresinol  <cit> , and many other dirs had the same function  <cit> . however, in the presence of atdir <dig>  the final product of e-coniferyl alcohol was the enantiomer -pinoresinol. from the topology tree of dirs from different species , iidir2/3/ <dig> were adjacent to atdir <dig>  and iidir <dig> was next to atdir <dig>  these observations suggested that iidir1/2/3/ <dig> might have similar functions with atdir <dig> and atdir <dig> 

sequence comparisons between atdir <dig> and iidir2/3/ <dig> as well as atdir <dig>  iidir <dig>  fidir <dig> and tpdir <dig> were performed by clustalx  <dig>   <cit> . the results showed that iidir <dig> had  <dig> % identity with atdir <dig>  while iidir <dig> and iidir <dig> had only  <dig> % and  <dig> % identity with atdir <dig>  it suggested that the relative among iidir <dig>  iidir <dig> and atdir <dig> might far away from that between iidir <dig> and atdir <dig>  iidir <dig> had  <dig> % identity with atdir <dig>  residues conservation was shown in figure  <dig> figure  <dig>

to examine sequence features of these iidir sequences, sequence comparison between  <dig> iidirs and  <dig> brdirs were carried out as well. the  <dig> iidirs showed five well conserved motifs in their amino acid sequences like  <dig> brdirs .figure  <dig>

transcript abundance analysis of iidirs in different organs
since the transcript abundance of a gene was often correlated with its function, the relative constitutive abundance of the  <dig> iidirs were quantified in total rna isolated from roots, stems, leaves and flowers through real-time pcr using gene-specific primers . the organ specific expression of each iidir gene was normalized to actin as control and compared with root as reference using 2-△△ct method. the transcript abundance level was showed in figure  <dig> figure  <dig>

based on rt-pcr analysis,  <dig> iidirs  displayed the highest transcript abundance in all tissues. another  <dig> iidirs  showed higher transcript abundance in roots and flowers than in stems and leaves. iidir <dig> was higher in leaves and iidir <dig> was higher in flowers. iidir1/12/13/16/ <dig> were hardly expressed in leaves. the remaining two iidirs  were nearly not detected in any tissue .

compared with the gene transcript abundance in roots, iidir <dig> was more than  <dig> fold higher in flowers. all of these genes were lowly expressed in leaves than in other tissues except iidir <dig>  most iidirs have comparatively higher transcript abundance in roots and flowers than in stems and leaves, such as iidir2/10/11/14/15/17/ <dig>  the transcript abundance of iidir <dig> and iidir <dig> were higher in stems and flowers than in roots and leaves. iidir <dig> and iidir <dig> were expressed more in stems .

transcript abundance analysis after treatment with meja
meja was used to induce the gene transcript abundance at hairy roots of i indigotica for different times. the iidirs’ transcript abundance was showed in figure  <dig>  the result of iidir <dig> was not tested during this experiment. iidir1/2/4/5/ <dig> were down regulated at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 24 h compared with 0 h. iidir8/9/10/ <dig> were up regulated at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 24 h compared with 0 h. the left genes were up or down regulate at different times. iidir <dig> and iidir <dig> were nearly not expressed in roots, stems, leaves or flowers, but both of them were up regulated after treatment with meja. the regulation was lasting till the end of the experiment. this indicated that iidir <dig> and iidir <dig> may take part in defense response. iidir6/7/12/16/ <dig> were lowly expressed in roots. after treatment with meja, they were up regulated at different times and last for a period of time.figure  <dig>

discussion
dir and dir-like proteins belong to a multigene family. they are found in all of the major terrestrial plants  <cit>  and are considered to have developed an important enzymatic reaction for the production of lignin and lignan during the time of the adaptation of aquatic plants to the terrestrial environment  <cit> . the gene number of dir proteins in plants is different from each other. there are  <dig> dirs in a. thaliana,  <dig> dirs in b. rapa and  <dig> dirs in rice  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> dirs are discovered from i indigotica by bioinformatics methods for the first time.

from the prediction of the orfs, combined with the topology structures, it is found that the dir amino acid sequences are divergent, ranging from the shortest protein of  <dig> aa  to the longest of  <dig> aa . the length of the dir-e subfamily members is longer than dirs from the other subfamilies; they range from  <dig> aa  to  <dig> aa . iidirs in the dir-a subfamily range from  <dig> aa  to  <dig> aa . the length of the iidirs in the dir-b/d subfamily is similar with dir-a subfamily, ranging from <dig> aa  to  <dig> aa .

sequence analysis of iidirs, using currently available web-based bioinformatics tools , indicated that most iidirs have cleavable n-terminal signal peptides varying from  <dig> aa to  <dig> aa  suggesting an extracellular localization.this means that these iidirs are likely to be secreted proteins. n-glycosylation sites  are a feature of secreted proteins and have been found in fidir <dig>  the first and best characterized dir protein  <cit> . thirteen of these  <dig> iidirs have more than one asn sites, also indicating that most iidirs were likely to be secreted protein.

the secondary and tertiary structures show that the iidirs are all β-strand proteins. all the iidirs have potential β-strands, separated by regions of coils. the β-strands shape the iidir proteins like a barrel. the only α-helix exists in the n-terminus and appears to be the signal peptide. both netsurfp and psipred prediction for the secondary structure of iidirs show that dirs are all-beta strand proteins. this is in agreement with previous studies  <cit> . halls et al.  <cit>  find out that the -pinoresinol-forming dirigent protein from f. intermedia has been confirmed by circular dichroism analysis and is primarily composed of β-sheet and loop structures.

hitherto, dirs have not been crystallized  <cit> , and x-ray or nmr structures are remain unavailable. homologous proteins with known structures can serve as templates for modeling of dirs. therefore phyre <dig> is used with intensive modeling to perform the prediction of the tertiary structures of iidirs, as well as searching for the homologous proteins of iidirs. it results that all the iidirs are barrel-like proteins.

the topological tree  showed that iidirs are divided into dir-a, dir-b/d, and dir-e subfamilies. pdir <dig> is separated from dir-b/d subfamily and clustered to dir-g subfamily. osdir1/2/3/4/9/ <dig> from dir-g subfamily are clustered with dir-b/d subfamily. this is in agreement with ralph’s studies  <cit> . ralph found subsequently that several sequences from the previous distinct dir-d cluster were merged with the former dir-b subfamily to form the new dir-b/d subfamily and left the rice dir-like proteins from the former dir-d subfamily group to be a separate subfamily, dir-g  <cit> . in this study, members of the dir-b/d and dir-g subfamilies are recombined again. this might be the result of extended dir genes.

it should be noted that the transcript abundance of most iidirs are comparatively higher in roots and flowers than in stems and leaves. this is in accordance with arasan’s finding in b. rapa dirs  <cit> . it is well known that dir genes are participate in lignin biosynthesis. so the iidirs transcript abundance in an organ specific manner in this study suggests that iidirs take possible roles in specific organs through lignin formation and participate in i. indigotica’s developmental processes. these organs also share characteristics that make them particularly prone to other stresses and protect themselves against stress attack. to find out iidirs transcript abundance in roots at the stress of meja, differential expression of iidir genes is mined from i. indigotica expression profiling database  <cit> . it shows that iidir <dig> and iidir <dig> may take part in defense response, because they are nearly not expressed in roots, stems, leaves or flowers, but both of them are up regulated after treatment with meja and the regulation lasting till the end of the experiment.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study,  <dig> dirs were distinguished from the i. indigotica transcription profiling database for the first time. sequence characters and transcript abundance of these  <dig> full-length iidirs were analyzed, respectively. the results showed that iidir <dig> and iidir <dig> are similar with atdir <dig> and atdir <dig>  they might have the ability to produce -lignans. the organ specific expression results in higher expression in roots and flowers than in stems and leaves indicated that roots and flowers may synthesis more lignin during plant development. iidir6/7/8/9/12/16/ <dig> were up regulated after treatment with meja, suggesting that they may take part in defense response. all this would provide basic data necessary for further studies.
