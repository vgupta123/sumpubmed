BACKGROUND
mus spretus mice are derived from wild mice collected in southern france, spain and northern africa  <cit> . m. spretus diverged from mus musculus one to three million years ago <cit> . recent data suggest that these mice are reported to have an average of one sequence variant every  <dig> bp  <cit> . strains of m. spretus are frequently utilized in combination with m. musculus strains in quantitative trait loci  studies due to the high degree of sequence and phenotypic diversity between the strains <cit> . indeed, m. spretus mice have been valuable for the identification of loci contributing to differences in immune response and inflammation  <cit> . m. spretus strains are also cancer resistant in comparison to several m. musculus strains and have been utilized for mapping of cancer susceptibility loci  <cit> .

unlike some of the other commonly used strains of mice for qtl mapping, none of the m. spretus strains have been fully sequenced. few reports of comparisons of sequence diversity within m. spretus strains exist, and most have been generally limited to one gene or small genomic region  <cit> . the majority of the sequence, microsatellite, and single nucleotide polymorphism  data available for m. spretus mice are from spret/ei; for researchers using non-spret/ei strains of m. spretus, such as seg/pas mice, there is limited strain-specific information available in public databases.

in previous studies, we observed a large difference between m. musculus and m. spretus strains in susceptibility to chemically-induced skin cancer. m. spretus mice chemically treated with  <dig>  12-dimethylbenz anthracene  and 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate  develop no skin papillomas after  <dig> weeks of treatment but m. musculus strains, such as nih/ola and fvb/n, develop an average of  <dig> or more papillomas  <cit> ., to identify loci for skin cancer susceptibility we created four f <dig> backcrosses between m. spretus  and m. musculus  mice. fifteen regions of linkage were identified  <cit> . one locus, skin tumor susceptibility  <dig> , a region on chromosome  <dig> with peak linkage at  <dig> cm showed strong evidence of linkage in one f <dig> backcross nih/ola × f <dig> 

as one means of identifying potential skin cancer susceptibility candidate genes at skts <dig>  we sequenced all predicted genes in four of the strains used for linkage nih/ola, fvb/nj, outbred spretus, and spret/eij. exons that contained amino acid alterations between the strains were sequenced in two additional strains of m. spretus  as well as fvb/nt . here, we describe the results from over  <dig> kb of sequence data from skts <dig>   <dig>  kb of which was sequenced in seven strains, and a phylogenetic comparison of the relatedness of four m. spretus strains.

RESULTS
confirmation of skts <dig> as a skin tumor susceptibility locus
skin tumor susceptibility  <dig>  was originally mapped as a skin tumor susceptibility locus to mouse chromosome  <dig> in a genome wide linkage analysis for skin cancer in an f <dig> backcross between nih/ola and outbred spretus mice  <cit> . we performed additional crosses between skin tumor resistant mice  and skin tumor susceptible mice  to further test this locus for linkage  <cit> . we observed no evidence for linkage at skts <dig> in the interspecific backcross nih/ola ×  or in the spret/eij by fvb/nt f <dig> interspecific backcross. the linkage analysis for the spret/eij by nih/ola f <dig> interspecific backcross  was inconclusive for linkage at skts <dig>  to refine the linkage region in the nih/ola × outbred spretus backcross, we genotyped additional markers on chromosome  <dig>  linkage analyses showed a peak lod score of  <dig>  at approximately  <dig> cm .

outbred spretus mice are not bred to homogeneity and segregate different polymorphisms and haplotypes across the genome. however, there was no evidence from the original linkage data generated from nine different outbred spretus fathers using  <dig> polymorphic markers for heterogeneity at skts <dig>  to further rule out the possibility of heterogeneity within these mice at skts <dig>  we genotyped seven additional microsatellite markers mapping to the peak linkage region of skts <dig> in dna from six non-littermate outbred spretus male mice. we observed no evidence of genetic heterogeneity . from these results we felt reasonably confident that there was no genetic heterogeneity within our outbred spretus mouse colony at this locus.

identification of variants between m. musculus and m. spretus
in order to identify polymorphic coding variants that fit the linkage data for skts <dig>  we first identified all known coding and non-coding genes at the peak region for linkage on chromosome  <dig>  using genetic maps from the ucsc genome browser, ensembl and entrez gene databases. maps were updated and throughout our project to include newly mapped genes. at the conclusion of this study,  <dig> coding elements including ten hypothetical genes/coding elements, nine snornas and one microrna were identified as mapping within skts <dig> . we designed pcr primers flanking all exons for the genes or coding elements mapping to skts <dig>  when multiple splice forms of a gene were predicted, we sequenced exons representing all splice variants.

to carry out a screen for coding differences between the resistant strain of mice  and the susceptible strain  that could be candidate variants for skts <dig>  we initially sequenced dna from nih/ola, fvb/nj, spret/eij, and one outbred spretus animal. exons containing amino acid variants were then sequenced in fvb/nt, seg/pas and stf/pas. variants shared between outbred spretus and stf/pas were eliminated as candidates since stf/pas does not show evidence for linkage at skts <dig> in the nih/ola backcross. pcr product was obtained from both m. spretus and m. musculus dna for all exons which rules out the possibility of large deletions in one strain of mice at this locus. our analysis did not rule out the possibility of causal variants in regulatory regions or duplication or inversion copy number polymorphisms at this locus.

analysis of sequence alignments of forward and reverse reads of  <dig>  bp from genes and coding elements mapping to skts <dig> led to the identification of  <dig>  polymorphisms between m. musculus and m. spretus strains . of these,  <dig> resulted in amino acid substitutions,  <dig> occurred between m. musculus and m. spretus strains and one occurred between nih/ola and fvb/nj. there were six sequence differences identified between fvb/nj and nih/ola, but no differences between fvb/nt and nih/ola.

characterization of nucleotide substitutions at skts5
to further characterize the nucleotide variants, we analyzed polymorphisms on a gene by gene basis. the number of polymorphisms identified per gene ranged from no changes to  <dig>  the rate of substitution per nucleotide ranged from 3/ <dig>  in nova <dig> to 8/ <dig>  in snorna <dig> . because synonomous changes are less likely to affect protein function, these were not evaluated further in the other strains of mice used in the linkage crosses  <cit> . a catalogue of the types and locations of polymorphisms  at skts <dig> include the following changes: nonsense , missense , small insertion/deletions , 5'utr , 3'utr  and potential splice-site alterations . to determine if the type of substitutions identified at skts <dig> could shed light on the evolutionary forces between m. spretus and m. musculus, we looked at the number and percentages of nucleotide changes and the type of mutations  in this data set . the transition to transversion ratio was approximately  <dig>  . given that c to t  transitions are a common mutation type due to the cpg methylation deamination process; these data are consistent with other large sequence comparisons <cit> .

identification of variants within m. spretus
we rationalized that in order for a bi-allelic polymorphism to be considered a candidate for skts <dig> that the cancer resistant strain  would have one allele and the susceptible strain  would have the other. in addition, closely related strain stf/pas that does not show evidence for linkage at skts <dig> should not share alleles with outbred spretus. of the  <dig> amino acid substitutions identified between m. musculus and m. spretus, three variants were present in spret/eij but not the other m. spretus strains . to rule out a sequencing or pcr artifact for those variants, new pcr product was generated and sequenced. all variants were confirmed as being unique to spret/eij. of the other  <dig> amino acid variants which were polymorphic between nih/ola and m. spretus,  <dig> were shared in all m. spretus strains analyzed and  <dig> were polymorphic between different m. spretus strains . eight variants fit our criteria for candidacy based on the linkage data .

conservation of amino acid alterations
just as non-synonomous changes have a greater likelihood of affecting protein function than synonomous changes, non-synonomous changes that occur in a evolutionarily conserved residue are more likely to be functionally significant  <cit> . to assess amino acid polymorphisms for potential functional significance, proteins were compared using ensembl ortholog prediction alignments between m. musculus and homo sapiens, pan troglyodytes, gallus gallus, rattus norvegicus, canis familiaris, bos taurus, xenopus tropicalis, takifugu rubripes, and monodelphis domestica when protein homologies existed . if only one amino acid in the orthologous protein position was present in at least eight of the nine non-musuclus species examined, we considered that position to be strongly conserved. twenty-four amino acids showed strong conservation by this criterion .

in addition to sequence alignments, we assessed amino acid polymorphisms for potential functionality through a sequence homology-based tool sorting intolerant from tolerant  <cit> . using sift, the majority of amino acid polymorphisms were scored as tolerant substitutions. surprisingly, a few amino acids that appear to be highly conserved across species, such as pik3cg ala405thr, were scored as well-tolerated substitutions using sift. eight variants were identified that were scored as intolerant substitutions by sift . these variants include ahr phe348leu, ankmy <dig> ile369thr, sostdc <dig> cys15ser, ifrd <dig> leu449phe, eg <dig> gly47ser, gly70ser and asn72tyr and f730043m19rik asn133ile. of these, we identified three  in our initial ortholog comparison studies . seven additional variants in other genes had sift scores of less than  <dig>  and may have mild functional effects .

of the  <dig> amino acid alterations that were polymorphic within m. spretus strains, four showed amino acid substitutions that were considered to be intolerant using sift . these changes all occurred in genes for which there is limited homology data for other species which may lead to over prediction of intolerance by sift. five other substitutions resulted in sift scores of  <dig>  or lower including 1110049b09rik pro691ala and lrrn <dig> ala69gln. polymorphisms in highly conserved amino acids may result in functional differences in these proteins and could account for phenotypic differences between m. spretus strains.

polymorphisms at splice sites
variants that fall at highly conserved splice acceptor or splice donor sites may also affect protein function due to alterations in splicing. twenty-four variants mapped within  <dig> bp of a splice site. to test whether these variants affected splicing, we isolated tail rna from nih/ola, outbred spretus and spret/eij and performed rt-pcr using primers from flanking exons. identically sized bands of roughly the same intensity were observed in all of the strains for nineteen of the primer sets tested indicating that these variants are unlikely to affect splicing . five variants were not tested for effects on splice site alterations because the variations mapped to the first or last exon of the gene.

comparison of sequence divergence within m. spretus strains
because this was, to our knowledge, the most sequence data generated from multiple m. spretus strains, we were interested in using this information to determine the degree of relatedness between m. spretus strains. we therefore conducted maximum parsimony analyses on exon sequence for spret/eij, seg/pas, stf/pas and outbred spretus to fvb/nj, and nih/ola utilizing phylip  <dig>   <cit> . we did not include fvb/nt in the analysis as we did not identify any sequence differences between fvb/nt and nih/ola. we included  <dig>  bp from coding and flanking exonic regions across skts <dig> on mouse chromosome  <dig> which represented sequence from  <dig> exons from  <dig> genes with the identified amino acid alterations and the non-coding polymorphisms within them. dna variants were all weighted equally. a maximum parsimony tree was generated from the data which was identical to a consensus tree from  <dig> bootstrap reiterations . as expected, the greatest phylogenetic distance occurred between the m. musculus and m. spretus groups. the fewest number of polymorphisms occurred between the m. musculus strains fvb/nj and nih/ola  mice. these data suggest that the inbred swiss-derived strains are more closely related than the wild-derived m. spretus strains. within m. spretus strains, spret/eij and outbred spretus were the most closely related, and stf/pas mice showed the most divergence from the other m. spretus strains. nonetheless, of the roughly  <dig>  amino acids assessed in all four m. spretus strains only  <dig> %  were polymorphic between m. spretus strains. if skts <dig> is representative of the genome as a whole, then most single nucleotide polymorphism data available for spret/eij from coding regions will have utility for other m. spretus strains.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the largest sequence-based comparison of multiple strains of m. spretus. based on sequence comparison of over  <dig> kb across a 15-mb region on chromosome  <dig>  m. spretus strains are more closely related to each other than to the swiss-inbred strains of m. musculus. outbred spretus and spret/eij have the highest sequence similarity. this is not unexpected as both of these m. spretus mice strains were derived from wild mice isolated from the same region of spain. stf/pas mice are derived from mice isolated in tunisia. this strain showed the highest divergence from the other m. spretus strains and was the m. spretus strain most closely related to the swiss-derived m. musculus mice. these data fit with the geographical ascertainment of the lines of m. spretus as the other m. spretus strains all come from spain.

in this dataset we observed an average of one polymorphism every  <dig> bp between m. musculus and m. spretus. this is less than half as frequent as previous reports of sequence variance between m. musculus and m. spretus  <cit> . however, this data set was almost entirely restricted to coding regions with only minimal amounts of flanking intronic sequence. genes are under different mutation constraints than non-functional intragenic regions and therefore show fewer variants  <cit> . within the  <dig> genes analyzed in this study,  <dig> had no amino acid polymorphisms,  <dig> genes had one to three amino acid variants and  <dig> genes had greater than four amino acid variants. despite the number of non-synonomous changes, the majority of amino acid variants identified in this study were not predicted to show functional consequences using sift. genes and amino acids that showed lower sift tolerance scores are being considered as candidates for skin cancer susceptibility.

we conducted this analysis to identify candidate genes for skts <dig>  from our criteria based on the linkage, a number polymorphisms were identified that were consistent with the linkage . these include eight amino acid changes that were found in outbred spretus that were not seen in stf/pas including three that have sift scores below  <dig> . these variants will be considered as candidates for the linkage. however, the nucleotide driving linkage at skts <dig> may also be in a non-sequenced regulatory or intragenic region and may affect gene expression or stability. there is also the small possibility that undetected heterogeneity at skts <dig> exists between the outbred spretus mice and we have not sequenced the genome containing the resistance allele. future studies will address these possibilities.

the five genes that showed the highest number of amino acid polymorphisms  do not share any known function and do not map next to each other at skts <dig>  ahr  mediates the toxicity of dioxin compounds, particularly polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons  <cit> . it has a large number of reported amino acid variants in both mouse and humans. some variants within ahr have been associated with differences in chemical toxicity in mouse and man  <cit>  and in modest effects on cancer risk in humans  <cit> . one of the amino acids identified in our study shows a very low sift score and may therefore affect ahr function, however this variant was observed in all m. spretus strains and is therefore not considered to be a candidate for skts <dig>  two ahr variants, asn533ser and asn544asp, fit with the linkage data but are not predicted to be functionally significant by sift. cog <dig> is part of the conserved oligomeric golgi  complex and has been postulated to mediate golgi trafficking. two amino acid polymorphisms have been reported in human but none in mouse. little is known about zfp <dig>  slc26a <dig> is a transmembrane glycoprotein that transports sulfate in the lower gut. slc26a <dig> has two amino acids reported in human and none in mouse. the function of 1110049b09rik is not known, but the purported human homologue, flj <dig>  has a large number of reported amino acid alterations as well . it is possible that the higher rate of amino acid substitution in these genes reflects some underlying selection pressures between m. musculus and m. spretus.

a number of potentially functional interesting variants were identified that do not fit with the linkage data. the only species in which the sostdc <dig> amino acid variant cys15ser was observed was in m. spretus. it is not known if substitution of a cysteine at position  <dig> with serine in the m. spretus isoform results in altered disulfide bond formation, disruption of other secondary structure or other functional consequence. another interesting polymorphism is in 4921508m14rik. this gene contains a stop codon at position  <dig> in all of the m. spretus strains theoretically resulting in a truncated protein missing the  <dig> terminal amino acids. the function of this gene is unknown. eg <dig>  which contains several amino acid variants thought to be functional by sift, is a predicted gene that has shown expression differences of unknown biological consequence in a number of murine studies  <cit> .

there was a relatively low degree of sequence variation between the m. spretus strains; however we identified twenty-two changes that resulted in intra-spretus amino acid polymorphisms. thus, based on this dataset, nearly twenty percent of the amino acid alterations identified between m. spretus and m. musculus are polymorphic within m. spretus. in contrast, sequencing results from the two swiss-derived m. musculus strains identified only one amino acid that was polymorphic between the fvb/nj strain and nih/ola. sequence comparison of three closely related m. musculus strains: nih/ola, fvb/nt and fvb/nj revealed only six of  <dig>  basepairs  that were polymorphic between nih/ola and fvb/nj. there were no sequence differences identified between fvb/nt and nih/ola. because sequence variants exist between fvb/nt and fvb/nj, researchers comparing results across studies should be aware of which strain of fvb/n is used. our results confirm previous studies in which variations in coding regions were more common in wild-mice than in laboratory-derived strains  <cit> , perhaps reflecting differences in breeding and selection pressure.

our data comparing sequence diversity between m. spretus strains may not be representative of genome as a whole since this study was limited to one locus on chromosome  <dig> and included only genes, predicted coding elements, and small amounts of flanking intronic sequences. in this study, we conducted our sequence comparisons by analyzing only exons in which we initially identified an amino acid variation between outbred spretus, spret/eij, fvb/n, and nih/ola. there may be additional amino acid variations at skts <dig> in which spret/eij, outbred spretus and nih/ola share an allele that is different from the other strains of m. spretus. we also cannot rule out the possibility that skts <dig> may have unique genomic properties compared to other loci. previous studies have reported different phylogenetic trees when comparing sequence samples from across the genome  with gene-specific phylogenetic trees  <cit> . skts <dig> may represent a region with unique local characteristics between m. spretus strains. for instance, skts <dig> may be under differential evolutionary constraints against sequence divergence in m. spretus strains. nonetheless, our data suggest that genomic data and single nucleotide markers in the database for spret/eij, particularly intragenic snps, are more likely to be shared with other m. spretus strains than with m. musculus strains, increasing the utility of the publicly available snp maps for studies utilizing any m. spretus mouse.
