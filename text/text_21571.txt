BACKGROUND
streptococcus thermophilus is a lactic acid bacteria species that is essential for the manufacturing of many types of fermented dairy products, occurring naturally as well as in commercial starter cultures  <cit> . because s. thermophilus can produce large amounts of lactic acid, exopolysaccharides, and flavor compounds in fermentation processes, it is considered the second most important industrial dairy starter after lactococcus lactis  <cit> . therefore, analyses of the genetic diversity, population structure, and phylogenetic relationships of s. thermophilus are important for understanding the evolution of ecological or biological properties of bacterial strains and for optimizing their industrial exploitation. especially, s. thermophilus is genetically similar to s. vestibularis and s. salivarius in s. salivarius group. several restriction- or pcr-based typing methods have been applied to the typing of s. thermophilus . more recently, a powerful method for population genetic studies is multilocus sequence typing , which is based on sequencing of conserved housekeeping genes. the method provides faster and less expensive nucleotide sequence determination, and has become the gold standard for studying the evolution and population genetics of pathogenic microbes  <cit> .

mlst involves the sequencing of a small number  of housekeeping genes for each strain. the sequences of each fragment are assigned allele numbers for each locus. all allele numbers are combined to define the allelic profile of the strain and each different allelic profile is assigned as a sequence type , which is used to describe the strain  <cit> . because the typing is based on nucleotide sequence, mlst is primarily used for the exchange of electronic data between laboratories via the internet and provides accurate information on strain evolution  <cit> . mlst has been used successfully in molecular epidemiology studies , and for identifying and typing lactic acid bacteria of various species of lactobacillus , pediococcus  <cit> , enterococcus  <cit> , oenococcus  <cit> , and lactococcus  <cit> . the mlst scheme also reported for s. thermophilus analyzed the nucleotide variability at eight genetic loci of 27 s. thermophilus and the phylogenic relationship of two oral streptococci s. salivarius and s. vestibularis in the salivarius group  <cit> .

in this study, 239 s. thermophilus isolated from different ecological sources and geographical areas and  <dig> whole genome strains  were used to:  developed an effective mlst scheme for characterization of s. thermophilus and distinguish three closely related species in s. salivarius group;  apply mlst to assess phylogenetic relationship and evolutionary characteristics of these strains;  compare the genetic diversity of s. thermophilus from different type of dairy foods and geographic origin.

methods
bacterial isolates and dna extraction
a total of  <dig> isolates of s. thermophilus were selected from lactic acid bacteria collection centre  of inner mongolia agriculture university in china. those included strains isolated from home-made fermented dairy foods  in  <dig> provinces of china and  <dig> provinces and  <dig> city of mongolia from  <dig> to  <dig>  all these isolates were identified based on 16s rrna gene sequencing, and some representative isolate were tested for gas production from glucose, salt tolerance , growth at different temperature  and ph  in mrs broth . the information of 239 s. thermophilus strains is listed in additional file  <dig>  thirty six completed genome strains  were chosen as reference strains for evaluate the novel mlst scheme . sequences of those completed genome strains were obtained directly from the ncbi genome database.table  <dig>  <dig> whole genome strains belonging to the salivarius group used in this study

all s. thermophilus strains were grown in  <dig>  ml m17-broth  supplemented with  <dig>  g/l of lactose at 30 °c for 18–22 h, and then strains were harvested by centrifugation and cell pellets were used for dna extraction. total genomic dna was extracted from cultures by using a previously reported method  <cit> . purified dna was diluted to a final concentration of 100 ng/μl for application.

mlst loci selection
ten housekeeping loci  were selected for mlst analysis of s. thermophilus isolates based on the chromosome locations , functions of the encoded proteins  and presence in all the strains as a single copy  <cit> . the primers of ten genes were designed by primer premier  <dig>  program  on the basis of known genome in s. thermophilus nd <dig>  <cit> , and the information of primers is listed in table  <dig> table  <dig> genes and primers used for multilocus sequence typing

pcr amplification and dna sequencing
for each strain, the genomic dna was used as a template for pcr amplification of mlst loci on the automatic thermal cycler . thermal cycling conditions for pcr were: 94 °c for 5 min; 30 cycles of 94 °c for 1 min, corresponding temperature of each locus for 1 min, and 72 °c for 2 min; a final elongation step of 72 °c for 10 min. for each target, pcr mixture  containing 150 ng of genomic dna, 10 mm of each dntp,  <dig> pmol of each primer,  <dig>  u taq polymerase in 1x pcr buffer . pcr products were electrophoresed in a  <dig>  % agarose gel. sequencing of the pcr products was performed in shanghai majorbio bio-pharm technology corporation. the same primers were used for pcr and sequencing on both dna strands.

mlst data analysis
for mlst analysis, forward and reverse sequences were trimmed, aligned, and analyzed using mega  <dig>  software package   <cit> . definition of alleles using a nonredundant dataset and minimum spanning tree analysis were preformed using the bionumerics software . different allelic sequences  were assigned arbitrary numbers. for each of the ten mlst loci, a unique nucleotide sequence defined an allele. unique allelic profiles, consisting of the allele numbers at each of the ten mlst loci, defined sts. the same st was used for several strains when they shared the same allelic profiles. groups of isolates with closely related allelic profiles have been called clonal complexes . sts were grouped into cc with the eburst program  <cit>  and located in the bionumerics program.

start version  <dig>  program  <cit>  was used for calculating the number of polymorphic sites, mol% g + c content, dn/ds, and ia and ias value for linkage analysis of the population as well as recombination testing. the nucleotide diversity  per site was calculated using dnasp version  <dig>   <cit> . the split decomposition method was used to assess the degree of tree-like structure for alleles of each locus and all sts using splitstree  <dig>   <cit> . the phi test for recombination based on individual loci of the whole strain collection was also done with splitstree. the phylogenetic trees from the concatenated sequences  were constructed by the neighbor-joining method with a kimura two-parameter distance model using mega  <dig> . bootstrap analysis with  <dig>  replicates was performed.

the software structure v <dig>   <dig> with linkage model  <cit>  was used to identify the ancestral subpopulations and assign ancestry proportions for each isolate. the k value that generated the highest posterior probability was used as the probable number of ancestral populations. three independent runs were performed for each value of the number of populations k ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  each run consisted of  <dig>  markov chain monte carlo  iterations, of which the first  <dig>  iterations were discarded as burn-in. the k value that generated the highest median posterior probability was used as the probable number of ancestral populations.

the evolutionary relationships amongst of s. thermophilus strains were inferred using clonalframe v <dig>   <cit> . three independent runs of clonalframe were performed each consisting of  <dig>  mcmc iterations, and a posterior sampling of  <dig>  iterations. the prior iterations were discarded and model parameters were sampled in the second period of the run every 100th iteration thereafter, resulting in  <dig>  samples from the posterior. the genealogy of the population was summarized and the robustness of the tree topology was evaluated by concatenating the posterior samples of the  <dig> runs to built-up a 50 % majority rule consensus tree using the clonalframe gui. the ρ/θ and r/m was also accounted by clonalframe.

nucleotide sequence accession numbers
all mlst data of s. thermophilus in this study are available at http://pubmlst.org/sthermophilus/  <cit> . allele sequences of the ten mlst loci have been deposited in the genbank database under accession numbers kf <dig> to kf <dig> 

RESULTS
allelic profiles and sequence types
the  <dig> genes were successfully amplified for all strains and sequenced by bidirectional sequencing technology, and forward and reverse sequences were trimmed, aligned, and analyzed. nucleotide positions of the sequences showing ambiguities were excluded from the analysis. ultimately, the sequences of  <dig> housekeeping genes, ranging in size from  <dig> to 630 bp , were used for mlst analysis.

additional file  <dig> summarizes the allelic profiles of the  <dig> isolates and 18 s. thermophilus reference strains. a total of  <dig> different sts  were obtained;  <dig> sts corresponded to single isolates,  <dig> sts included 2– <dig> isolates,  <dig> sts included 5– <dig> isolates, and  <dig> sts included 11– <dig> isolates. the most represented sts were st <dig> composed of  <dig> isolates , st <dig> , st <dig> , and st <dig> . the breakdown by region was as follows:  <dig> strains from  <dig> different regions of mongolia were identified as  <dig> sts, and  <dig> strains from  <dig> different provinces of china were assigned to  <dig> sts. among the  <dig> sts identified in our collection,  <dig> sts were attributed to strains isolated in more than two provinces. the widest type was st <dig>  which was identified in strains isolated in as many as five different provinces across china and mongolia. a similar distribution was observed for st <dig>  st <dig>  and st <dig>  which were identified in strains isolated from two provinces of china and mongolia, respectively; the remaining st strains were isolated in a specific province. moreover, almost all genome strains were identified as a single st, the exceptions being nd <dig>  mn-zlw- <dig>  ascc  <dig>  dgcc  <dig>  and lmd- <dig>  strain nd <dig> belonged to st <dig>  mn-zlw- <dig> belonged to st <dig>  ascc  <dig> and dgcc  <dig> belonged to st <dig>  and strain lmd- <dig> belonged to st <dig> 

nucleotide sequence variation at each mlst locus
we calculated the nucleotide diversity at each locus of all strains . all loci were polymorphic and the number of polymorphic nucleotide sites varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  suggesting a different rate of evolution. between  <dig>  and  <dig>  alleles were found for each locus. a total of  <dig> nucleotides comprised  <dig> polymorphic sites. the mol% g + c content observed for different gene fragments varied from  <dig>  %  to  <dig>  %  and was  <dig>  % for the full s. thermophilus nd <dig> genome  <cit> . the nucleotide diversity per site  among the  <dig> genes varied from  <dig>  in rpob to  <dig>  in pepn. the dn/ds ratio of  <dig> loci ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>   and all were far less than  <dig> , suggesting strong purifying selective pressure  in these genes.table  <dig> descriptive analysis of mlst data genetic variability at streptococcus thermophilus loci

evidence for recombination in s. thermophilus
the multilocus linkage disequilibrium between mlst loci was measured using the index of association   <cit>  and standardized index of association   <cit> . to minimize linkage disequilibrium introduced by sampling bias or recent expansion of adaptive genotypes, only one strain from each st was analyzed  <cit> . an ia of  <dig>   and an ias of  <dig>   for the  <dig> loci were obtained, which were greater than the value of  <dig> expected for a population at linkage equilibrium. this also shows the formation of an underlying clonal population structure of all the studied isolates. however, the low ias value confirms that recombination played a role in the evolution of the analyzed genes, and the split graphs of all ten loci and the concatenated sequences corroborated this. from the split graphs , we can see that some parallelogram structures were formed for the clpx, pepn, pepx, pyrg, and carb genes indicating that these genes have undergone a little intergenic recombination during evolution . in addition, the concatenated sequences of the  <dig> loci displayed a complex network-like structure , suggesting that there have been several recombination events for these  <dig> loci based on the phi test . it is deduced that the selection of  <dig> genes with a more recombination history maybe contribute to the recombination events.

the linkage disequilibrium analysis and split graphs proved that recombination are existent in the evolution of 257 s. thermophilus strains. then clonalframe was used to further assess the recombination or mutation play a leading role in the evolution of s. thermophilus. the r/m value  and ρ/θ value  were  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively. these low values indicate that recombination occurred less frequently than mutation at these loci in the evolution of 257 s. thermophilus.

clonal complexes and minimum-spanning tree analysis
assignment of sts to ccs by eburst analysis divided  <dig> sts into  <dig> ccs  and  <dig> singletons . the cc strains represented  <dig>  % of all strains. the colored zones between some circle groups in fig.  <dig> indicate profiles belonging to the same cc. the major ccs, cc <dig> , included  <dig> sts  with st <dig> identified as the ancestor genotype. cc <dig> comprised  <dig> strains isolated from seven different provinces in mongolia, and only one strain isolated from qinghai province in china . cc <dig> contained  <dig> isolates representing  <dig> sts , with most of the strains isolated from mongolia and  <dig> strains isolated from china. st <dig> was identified as the ancestor st of cc <dig>  cc <dig> included  <dig> sts with st <dig> identified as the ancestor genotype.  <dig> mongolian isolates,  <dig> chinese isolates, and reference strains jim  <dig>  lmd- <dig>  th <dig>  th <dig>  ascc  <dig>  and dgcc  <dig> comprise cc <dig> . cc <dig> consisted of  <dig> strains  and cc <dig> consisted of  <dig> strains , all isolated from xinjiang and tibet, and qinghai in china, respectively. all other ccs comprised less than  <dig> sts with a limited number of strains, and the strains in one cc were almost entirely from the same geographical location.fig.  <dig> minimum-spanning tree analysis of  <dig> streptococcus thermophilus isolates and  <dig> reference strains based on the allelic profiles of  <dig> genes. each circle corresponds to a sequence type , and the circle size denotes the number of strains sharing the same st. colored zones between some groups of circles indicate that these profiles belong to the same clonal complex . the strength of the link  is related to the genetic similarity  between profiles. black line was drawn as boundaries of each branch



to analyze the relationship between the clusters, geographic origin, and the source dairy product among the 257 s. thermophilus isolates, allelic profile-based phylogenetic analysis was performed using a minimum-spanning tree  analysis with the bionumerics v <dig>  software. to facilitate analysis, gansu and sichuan province of china were grouped into gannan region, and  <dig> provinces and one city in mongolia were grouped into three larger regions  based on geographic position and environment. as shown in fig.  <dig>  strains of the same allelic profile were in the same circle, the size of which was proportional to the number of strains of that particular profile, and the different colors of the circles indicate different strain regions. the mstree revealed four major branches and three minor branches. branch  <dig> contained  <dig> strains from cc <dig>  cc <dig> and  <dig> single sts. all strains were isolated from mongolia except st  <dig>  branch  <dig> contained three ccs  and strain f8ct. the isolates in these branches were from qinghai in china  and central mongolia . branch  <dig> contained three ccs , with isolates from xinjiang , gannan , qinghai , inner mongolia , central mongolia , and  <dig> reference strains. regarding cc <dig> as the center, branch  <dig> was divided into three minor branches . branch 4a included  <dig> strains of cc <dig>  mainly from mongolia . branch 4b, containing cc <dig> and cc <dig>  contained  <dig> strains isolated from mongolia. branch 4c contained  <dig> strains of cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig>  and cc <dig>  most isolated from xinjiang , tibet , gannan , and central mongolia . moreover, st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  and st <dig> do not belong to these four branches and are very different from st  <dig>  it is suggested that the phylogenetic relationships are more distant between these isolates compared to the others.

population structure and phylogenetic relationships
we attempted to statistically estimate the number of ancestral subpopulations  within the genetic population of the 119 s. thermophilus sts  using structure with the linkage model. a maximal posterior probability of k =  <dig> was found in our sample, meaning that the genetic diversity of s. thermophilus can be divided into six ancestral subpopulations. for each st, the average proportion of genetic material derived from each ancestral population is shown in fig. 2b. the  <dig> sts fell into six distinct populations based on the major ancestral source of genetic diversity. subpopulation  <dig>  contained  <dig> sts,  <dig> from mongolia and  <dig> from tibet, xinjinag province, and gannan in china. subpopulation  <dig>  comprised  <dig> sts from mongolia . subpopulation  <dig>  consisted of  <dig> sts, mainly from mongolia , and subpopulation  <dig>  consisted of  <dig> sts derived from central mongolia strains and  <dig> reference strains. subpopulation  <dig>  comprised  <dig> sts represented by isolates from central mongolia  and qinhai province in china . subpopulation  <dig>  contained  <dig> sts from five reference strains and one mongolian strain. there was little admixture of ancestral sources among these six subpopulations, suggesting high homogeneity for the sts of each subpopulation. moreover, st <dig> and st <dig> contained a high degree of admixture, which seemed to have acted frequently both as donors and as recipients of recombination exchanges.fig.  <dig> nj tree and ancestry of  <dig> streptococcus thermophilus sts. a neighbour-joining tree constructed from concatenated sequences of the  <dig> mlst loci. bootstrap values are indicated for all branches. sts are colored according to their affiliation to one of the six ancestral subpopulations; admixed sts are in black. b sources of ancestry of each unique st from six ancestral subpopulations by structure . six ancestral subpopulations are colored in green , yellow , pink , blue , red  and orange . each st is represented by a single line with the st designation at the top consisting of colored stacked bars that indicate the proportion of ancestry from each of six subpopulations



the phylogeny of the  <dig> sts was analyzed by constructing a nj tree from the concatenated sequences of  <dig> loci. as shown in fig. 2a, the nj tree revealed four major branches. the colored branches of the nj tree are in accordance with the color of the groups identified in structure. as shown in fig.  <dig>  we found that the sts of subpopulations  <dig>  and  <dig> ,  <dig>  were distributed in differenced branches of the nj tree. to examine any possible influences of recombination on tree topology, we inferred a clonal genealogy from our data using clonalframe, which takes recombination into account during tree building. the clonalframe tree  showed all isolates fell into five lineages, a-e. five subpopulations  identified in structure  corresponded to the subpopulations shown in additional file  <dig> and are represented by corresponding colors. however, subpopulation  <dig>  found in structure, did not constitute a lineage in the nj analysis and st <dig>  fell into lineage c. the other sts formed small clades at this level of analysis based on the clonalframe results. based on the combined evidence from the structure and clonalframe analyses, the 257 s. thermophilus strains formed five lineages during evolution.

phylogenetic analysis of s. thermophilus within the salivarius group
s. thermophilus belongs to the salivarius group, together with the two oral streptococci s. salivarius and s. vestibularis, and these three species are genetically very similar. a mlst scheme was created to analyze the phylogenetic relationships among these three species using five housekeeping genes   <cit> . s. thermophilus is the only nonpathogenic streptococcus originating from dairy products. comparative genomic analysis found that the origin of genes acquired by s. thermophilus is suggested to be other lab living in recurrent association with s. thermophilus in cheese or yogurt manufacture  <cit> . therefore, we developed a new mlst scheme for s. thermophilus based on fragments of  <dig> housekeeping genes, which were used in a previous analysis of lab. a phylogenetic tree was constructed using  <dig> whole genome strains, including 18 s. thermophilus, 16 s. salivarius, and 2 s. vestibularis, and the concatenated sequences of  <dig> loci . it revealed four clear branches and the species s. thermophilus, s. salivarius, and s. vestibularis were supported by significant bootstrap values. the nj tree also shows the existence of a fourth branch consisting of the three strains. in addition, 16 s. salivarius and 2 s. vestibularis were separated from each other, indicating that this mlst scheme is suitable for analyzing the population structure of all species in the salivarius group.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of  <dig> streptococcus thermophilus, 2 s. vestibularis and 16 s. salivarius strains, based on the concatenated sequences of  <dig> housekeeping genes



discussion
s. thermophilus is a key species involved in the acidification of milk and the development of texture in various fermented dairy products. however, few studies have characterized the diversity of the genetic population and the evolutionary scheme of this food bacterium from different ecological origins. to contribute to the characterization of the population structure of s. thermophilus, we utilized the mlst method to examine  <dig> strains isolated from different ecological sources and geographical areas.

mlst was first used for pathogenic microbes  <cit> . this technique is useful for elucidating the phylogenetic relationships and evolution of isolates. traditional mlst schemes generally include only five to seven gene loci, the lengths of which range from  <dig> to 500 bp. this small number of gene loci and short length may lead to a decrease in information and unreliable results. based on previous mlst studies of lab and the s. thermophilus nd <dig> genome,  <dig> gene targets  were first selected for mlst analysis in this study. two loci  could not be amplified from all examined strains and were removed. from these  <dig> gene loci, 239 s. thermophilus isolates and  <dig> genome strains were identified as  <dig> sts. the number of alleles per locus ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  when any gene locus with the lowest number of alleles was removed from the analysis, the number of sts decreased. finally, an optimization of the mlst scheme based on these  <dig> housekeeping genes was chosen for analyzing s. thermophilus. compared to previous mlst schemes  <cit> , an average of  <dig> distinguishable alleles per locus among the  <dig> sts were identified, which is more than the average of 6– <dig> alleles observed from 27 s. thermophilus isolates in a previous study. phylogenetic analysis of whole genome strains within the salivarius group showed that our method could clearly separate three closely related species and also confirmed the existence of an additional cluster. our mlst scheme has strong typing discrimination for s. thermophilus and could be applied to the other two species in the salivarius group.

analysis of synonymous and non-synonymous changes in the allele sequences of a locus can be used to determine whether it is subject to selection pressure. in our analysis, all loci displayed a dn/ds ratio lower than  <dig>  indicating a strong purifying selection preventing amino acid changes, which is a typical phenomenon for housekeeping genes and is desired in mlst schemes. the π of the  <dig> genes varied from  <dig>  in rpob to  <dig>  in pepn. previous reports on other lactic acid bacteria have ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for l. plantarum  <cit> ,  <dig>  to  <dig>  for l. delbruecki  <cit> , and  <dig>  to  <dig>  for leuconostoc mesenteroides  <cit> . these results suggest that the examined s. thermophilus housekeeping genes are relatively conserved. loss of gene function, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer  were proposed to contribute to the plasticity of the s. thermophilus genome  <cit> . the low ias value  and network structure of the split-graph in this study confirms that recombination may have occurred, while the low ρ/θ and r/m value indicate that recombination has not played a major role in the evolution of these loci. we infer that the discrepancy between our data and the literature may be related to the selected loci and s. thermophilus isolates.

the population structure within the sequences was analyzed using the linkage model in structure. it is suggested that the six ancestral subpopulations in our isolates and some sts contain a high degree of admixture . to examine any possible influences of recombination on tree topology, we inferred a phylogenetic tree using clonalframe. the clonalframe tree  revealed that subpopulation  <dig> identified in structure did not represent a true lineage, because this subpopulation is, in fact, a random mixture of strains that did not fall into one of the five true lineages and does not represent a real evolutionary lineage. however, the nj tree contains four major branches, but they are not well supported because of low bootstrap values. the low bootstrap values are representative of the inherently incongruent phylogenetic signals in the nj topology. it is suggested that the admixture of sts possibly contributed to the overall poor support values for the nj topology  <cit> . compared with the analytical tools in clonalframe and structure, our data demonstrate that nj analysis is not necessarily a suitable method for analyzing phylogenetic relationships between bacteria using mlst data.

one interesting application of the mlst technique was the identification of an association between strains and their origin. previous studies on  <dig> lactobacillus casei isolates using mlst demonstrated specificity to particular ecological niches  <cit> . however, the mstree  and clonalframe tree  analyses in this study suggest that the evolution of s. thermophilus isolates have little relationship with geographic locality. often, most strains from the same location clustered together, while the rest were dispersed across other clusters. the isolates from the same region are likely to have been exposed to similar environment selective pressures. for instance, tibet and xinjiang are located in western china, and have similar climate characteristics of drought and extensive sunshine, thus most isolates from those regions belong to the same lineage. reference strain nd <dig> was isolated from qinghai province in china, so it belongs to st <dig> along with the  <dig> qinghai isolates. in addition, it is interesting that the central mongolian strains are distributed in several lineages. central mongolia includes the city of ulaanbaatar, the capital of mongolia. because of the traffic network in ulaanbaatar, trade contacts were more frequent with the other provinces of mongolia and china. we deduced that fermented food exchange was a factor that may have contributed to the distribution of the central mongolian strains, but the reference strains, especially the  <dig> european strains, have no strong relationship to the lineages and origins of the examined strains that could be identified, based either on the isolation of dairy sources or the sampling location. furthermore, no significant associations between lineages and the type of dairy products were found in our collection of s. thermophilus , which was probably due to an unequal number of isolates from different fermented products. a total of 182 s. thermophilus were isolated from fermented cow milk, whereas only  <dig> strains were from other fermented dairy products . as more isolates are collected from different countries and types of fermented products, further evidence may become available for the grouping of s. thermophilus compared to worldwide isolates, which would provide a strong indication of the factors that have affected its evolutionary history.

CONCLUSIONS
mlst was used to study the genetic polymorphisms and evolutionary relationships of  <dig> isolates of s. thermophilus from different origins. analysis of a geographically diverse and representative collection of isolates using mlst can provide a better understanding of s. thermophilus genome evolution, and provide information for future studies on the structure and genetic evolution of s. thermophilus globally.
