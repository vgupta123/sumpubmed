BACKGROUND
rats are widely used models of basic biology, human physiology and disease, but the study of genes and their functions in rats lags far behind progress in mice. during the 1980s, mice became the predominant model for functional genetic studies because progress culturing and manipulating eggs and embryos  <cit>  of this species facilitated pronuclear injection and blastocyst injection, ex vivo  <cit> . in addition, development of germline competent embryonic stem cells  <cit>  enabled complex and targeted genetic manipulations . in contrast, pronuclear injection is generally considered less efficient in rats  <cit> , germline competent es cells were only recently established for this species  <cit>  and there are no reports of gene targeting in es cells to produce knockout rats.

rats are particularly amenable to laboratory investigations because of their intermediate size, short gestation and high fecundity. rats are about ten times larger than mice and thus, provide more tissue and are more amenable to surgical manipulation, vascular access and repeated sampling. due in part to these features, the rat is a valuable model for transplantation, cardiovascular, hypertension, neuroscience, pharmacology, diabetes, obesity, aging and cancer  <cit> . furthermore, there is over a century of phenotypic and physiological data on anatomy, physiology and disease for various inbred rat models  <cit> . combining these data with improved genetic and genomic resources will provide unprecedented opportunities for functional genetic studies in this species. recognizing this opportunity, nih has funded the rat expressed sequence tag  program, the rat genome program and the rat genome database and established the rat resource research center  during the past decade  <cit> . this nih effort is matched by the national bio resource project for the rat  in japan and rat resource repositories in europe . thus, there is a strong impetus to expand the transgenic tools for this species.

production of transgenic rats by pronuclear injection  <cit>  is now routine, albeit less efficient than for the most efficient mouse strains  <cit> . in addition, lentiviruses  <cit> , sperm  <cit>  and spermatogonial stem cells  <cit>  have recently been exploited as vehicles for modifying the rat germline and producing transgenic rats with efficiencies ranging from 6-46%. although germline competent es cells have not yet been used to produce knockout rats, transgenic expression of short hairpin rnas  or micrornas  allow knockdown of target gene expression for investigations of gene function  <cit> . chemical mutagenesis of germ cells by n-ethyl-n-nitrosourea  can introduce random point mutations in rat genome, but the requirement of labor-intensive screening analysis and high cost limits its application  <cit> . finally, pronuclear injection of zinc-finger nucleases is a new tool to generate knockout rats  <cit> . thus, several approaches are now available to modify and manipulate the rat genome/transcriptome and expand the transgenic resources for this species.

some transgenic manipulations have developmental effects , which preclude studies in adult tissues. these problems can be circumvented through the use of tissue-specific and/or conditional promoters. several inducible promoter systems have been described, including those regulated by tetracycline  <cit> , ecdysone  <cit> , rapamycin  <cit> , or steroids  <cit> . the tetracycline -inducible system has been the most extensively characterized and allows conditional regulation of gene expression in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo  <cit> . tet-repressor , tet transactivator  and reverse tet transactivator  systems mediate tetracycline -controlled transactivation of a second recombinant transgene located downstream of composite promoters that contain tet operator  sequences . to date, over  <dig> different tetracycline-regulated transgenic mouse lines have been described . in contrast, only a few rat lines have been generated, expressing either tta  <cit>  or rtta  <cit> . to facilitate loss-of-function studies, two conditional  transgenic rats have been described in which tetr/teto system is employed to regulate expression of an shrna  <cit> .

here we describe the generation and characterization of a novel tet-on transgenic rat. this transgenic line was generated by injecting lentiviral vectors containing the ubiquitous rosa <dig> promoter  <cit>  and an rtta-m <dig> transgene under the zona pellucida of one-cell rat embryos, as previously described  <cit> . rtta-m <dig> is a mutant of rtta that has increased stability, reduced background expression in the absence of doxycycline  and improved inducibility in the presence of dox  <cit> . rosa-rtta-m <dig> rats generated in this study exhibit wide-spread expression of rtta-m <dig> and dox-regulated transactivation of a target teto7/cmv-egfp transgene. the teto7/cmv composite response element is commonly referred to as ptet or tre.

RESULTS
the rosa26-rtta-m <dig> lentiviral vector  was injected under the zona pellucida of  <dig> 1-cell s/d rat embryos. a total of  <dig> injected embryos  cleaved to produce 2-cell embryos after overnight culture and these were transferred to the oviducts of  <dig> pseudopregnant s/d female rats. these transferred embryos resulted in  <dig> live progeny and rt-pcr results  indicated that  <dig>  of these carried the rosa26-rtta-m <dig> transgene. four founder progeny  were maintained for further characterization. southern blot analyses indicated that founder animals had between two  and six  proviral insertion sites . the intensity of bands corresponding to independent insertions were varying in some cases, indicating they could be genetic mosaics.

cultures of tail fibroblasts were established for each founder animal and were transduced with a lentivirus containing the teto7/cmv-egfp reporter transgene  in the presence of dox. egfp fluorescence was observed  <dig> hours later in fibroblasts from two founders  using an epifluorescent microscope . egfp expression was not observed in the absence of dox . the founder tg <dig>  with five proviral integrations and the most robust dox-dependent egfp expression, was selected to establish a rosa26-rtta-m <dig> transgenic rat line. this founder was bred to wild type s/d females to produce f <dig> transgenic progeny and segregate the independent integration sites.

all transgene insertions from founder   <dig> were transmitted through the germline and four different integration patterns were recovered in the f <dig> progeny . cultures of tail fibroblasts established for each of the f <dig> progeny were transduced with lenti-teto7/cmv-egfp and maintained in the presence or absence of dox for  <dig> hours. western blot analyses demonstrated dox-dependent expression of the egfp reporter gene from progeny with each integration pattern and revealed that expression level was not dependent on the number of integration sites . indeed, f <dig> progeny with only a single integration  exhibited the highest level of dox-dependent egfp expression . f <dig> female  <dig> and f <dig> male  <dig> had a common single integration site corresponding to integration pattern d and were bred together to establish the homozygous transgenic line rosa-rtta-m2-1089/ <dig> . cultures of tail fibroblasts established from homozygous f <dig> progeny exhibited tight regulation and dox dose-dependent induction of the teto7/cmv-egfp reporter transgene . immunocytochemical analysis of gfp expression in cultures of tail fibroblasts from the f2-f <dig> generation of homozygous rosa-rtta-m <dig> rats demonstrated that the transgene is stably integrated, transmitted through the germline and not silenced . rats from this line exhibited normal fertility and appeared phenotypically normal. real-time pcr analysis was used to quantitatively evaluate rtta-m <dig> expression in multiple tissues. from the twelve tissues analyzed, the highest rtta-m <dig> expression was observed in skeletal muscle, followed by liver, kidney, brain, heart, adrenal, lung, intestine, testis, uterus, ovary and spleen .

linker-mediated pcr was used to amplify the junctions between chromosomal dna and the rosa26-rtta-m <dig> transgene . sequence comparison with the ncbi rat genomic database indicated that the transgene integrated into intron  <dig> of a putative gene  on chromosome  <dig> . the integration site was further confirmed by pcr amplification of the junctions between genomic and transgene dna . amplification of the 5' junction produced a  <dig> kb product , which was cleaved to the expected smaller products by ecor <dig>  and spe <dig> . rt-pcr was performed to compare expression of the putative gene  in tissues of wild type and rosa-rtta-m <dig> rats. expression of the putative gene was observed in heart, ovary and testis, but not brain, kidney or liver. there were no differences in expression of the putative gene between wild type and transgenic rats .

to test the function of the rtta-m <dig> transgene in vivo, the teto7/cmv-egfp reporter lentivirus was injected into testes, skeletal muscle  and kidney of rosa-rtta-m <dig> rats maintained with or without dox in the drinking water. based on real time pcr results in figure 4f, these represent low , medium  and high  expressing tissues. dox-dependent expression of egfp was observed in testis , skeletal muscle  and kidney . egfp expression was not observed for any of these tissues in the absence of dox .

discussion
in this study, we generated a "tet-on" transgenic rat line that exhibits ubiquitous expression of the modified reverse tetracycline-dependent transactivator, rtta-m <dig>  under control of the rosa <dig> promoter. as detailed in the introduction, it is the dawn of a new era for biological investigations using the rat model. vast phenotypic and physiological data generated over the past century on rat anatomy, physiology and disease can now be combined with new genetic resources to enable state of the art functional genetic investigations. the best way to study gene function is through the generation of gain-of-function  or loss-of-function  animal models. the functions of over  <dig>  genes have been investigated using transgenic or knockout approaches in the mouse . considerably fewer genes in the rat genome have been studied functionally using gain-of-function or loss-of-function mutants. this deficit in rats may arise in part from the fact that traditional transgenic approaches in rat are less efficient than in mouse and in part from the fact that germline competent rat embryonic stem  cell lines were not available, until recently  <cit> . to date, there are no reports that these rat es cells have been used for targeted inactivation of specific genes and generation of knockout rats. however, geurts and co-workers recently reported the generation of targeted mutant rats by injection of zinc finger nucleases in embryos. this may constitute a powerful approach for generating loss-of-function rat models and has the potential for widespread application if it can be combined with homologous recombination  <cit> .

several approaches have been used to generate transgenic rats, including pronuclear injection, icsi  <cit> , spermatogonial stem cells  <cit>  and lentiviral injection into one cell embryos  <cit> . these approaches have varying efficiencies, strengths and weaknesses. no single approach is superior for every application. in the current study, tet-on transgenic rats were generated by injecting lentiviral vectors  under the zona pellucida of one cell embryos. this approach was initially described for rats by lois and co-workers  <cit>  and is significantly more efficient  than the standard pronuclear injection method. lentivirus-mediated transgenesis does have limitations. the transgene cassette inserted between the viral ltrs is typically limited to less than  <dig> kb. viral genomes with larger transgenes are not packaged efficiently, leading to decreased viral titer. the rosa-rtta-m <dig> transgene cassette was approximately  <dig>  kb, well within the capacity of the lentiviral genome.

a second limitation of lentivirus-mediated transgenesis is that each lentiviral integration contains a single copy of the transgene, rather than head to tail arrays of multiple transgenes that can occur after pronuclear injection. this may be limiting if high levels of transgene expression are required. also, multiple integrations in a founder generated by lentiviral injection will be segregated in the next generation. for example, founder tg <dig> with five transgene integrations produced progeny with four different integration patterns .

integration site effects were also revealed in the f <dig> progeny from founder tg <dig>  f <dig> progeny with integration pattern d  exhibited stronger expression of the rtta-m <dig> transgene than f <dig> progeny with integration pattern b . expression of rtta-m <dig> from the single homozygous integration in the rosa-rtta-m <dig> line was sufficient to drive expression from the lenti-teto7/cmv-egfp reporter gene, in vitro  and in vivo .

functional genetic studies can be complicated if the genetic modification causes an embryonic lethal phenotype. this complication can be circumvented by using conditional expression systems that allow the target transgene to be activated at specific times of development. in the current study we utilized a mutant of the reverse tet transactivator  that activates gene expression by binding to the tet operator  in the presence of doxycycline . the m <dig> iteration of rtta is stable in mammalian cells , functions at a 10-fold lower concentration of dox than rtta and causes no background expression  <cit> . we found that rtta-m <dig> exhibited similar characteristics in rat primary fibroblasts and in vivo using the rosa-rtta-m <dig> line. this transgenic rat line has been bred to homozygosity and has been propogated to the fifth generation without silencing of transgene expression. early this year, three groups have reported generating transgenic rats by driving tetr expression with the chicken β-actin or ubiquitin promoters  <cit>  or tta by the chicken β-actin promoter  <cit> . in addition, konopka and coworkers  <cit>  generated a "tet-on" transgenic rat in which rtta is driven by the ef1α promoter. the ef1α promoter is typically expected to cause ubiquitous expression, but functional rtta expression  was limited to the testis in that study.

CONCLUSIONS
the rosa-rtta-m <dig> tet-on rat line may provide a versatile tool for functional genetic studies because rtta is ubiquitously expressed and can regulate conditional expression of target transgenes, in vitro or in vivo. in the current proof-of-principle study, an egfp reporter gene was placed downstream of tet operator sequences and cmv minimal promoter  in a lentiviral vector. similar constructs can be used for conditional over-expression or knock-down  by replacing egfp with any transgene of interest. functions of target genes can be evaluated in vivo by injecting the target transgene into tissues of rosa-rtta-m <dig> rats as demonstrated here or by breeding rosa-rtta-m <dig> rats to a second transgenic line containing the teto7/cmv minimal promoter and a transgene of interest. the utility and flexibility of the tet regulatory system in rats will be increased by continuing to generate various iterations of tet repressors, tet transactivators and tet responsive promoters, including the use of alternative ubiquitous or tissue-specific promoters.
