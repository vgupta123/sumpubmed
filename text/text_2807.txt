BACKGROUND
in swine, the rate of pubertal development and successful pregnancy in gilts affects the efficient management of breeding females. selection for growth rate and leanness in modern commercial pigs has resulted in a delay in the onset of puberty  <cit> . age at puberty and weaning to estrus interval  are positively correlated  <cit>  and the primary reason for culling sows is failure to return to estrus after weaning. quantitative trait loci  have been identified for age of puberty in the pig on different chromosomes  <cit> . one of the qtl regions is located on the long arm of pig chromosome  <dig>  near the telomere, which is homologous to human chromosome 10p <dig>  <cit> . the q-arm of pig chromosome  <dig> also has qtl for ovulation rate  <cit>  and number of nipples  <cit> . in the human, an aldo-keto reductase  gene family  has been identified near the telomere on chromosome 10p <dig> that contains at least six aldo-keto reductase family  <dig>  member c genes  <cit> . the homologous region on mouse chromosome  <dig> contains a cluster of eight or nine akr1c genes  <cit> . these duplicated genes maintain a high degree of sequence similarity, but differ greatly in their substrate specificity and tissue expression patterns.

the akr superfamily are monomeric oxidoreductases that catalyze the nadp-dependent reduction of a wide variety of substrates, ranging from steroids, prostaglandins, bile acids, carbohydrates and xenobiotics  <cit> . akrs are also thought to deactivate damaging reactive oxygen species like carbonyl compounds from lipids and proteins leading to their elimination  <cit> . aldo-keto reductases interconvert weak androgens, estrogens, progestins, mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids to their more potent counterparts by catalyzing the reduction and oxidation of keto- and hydroxysteroids, respectively, thereby regulating a wide range of physiological processes involved in development, homeostasis and reproduction  <cit> . in this manner, akrs regulate the occupancy and transactivation of several steroid receptors in target tissues leading to transcription of hormone-responsive genes  <cit> . these steroid substrates can also act directly through "non-genomic" effects, such as, formation of neuroactive steroids and activation of ion channels, g-protein-coupled receptors and several kinase signalling pathways. the products of akr activity have been implicated in prostate disease, breast cancer, obesity, polycystic ovary disease and delay in the onset of puberty in humans  <cit> . because of their location in the swine genome and their implication in directing reproductive physiology, this gene cluster was characterized and evaluated for affecting age at puberty in the pig.

RESULTS
identification of akr1c genes
a genomic amplicon spanning exons  <dig> and  <dig> of akr1c <dig>  probed against one third of the porcine rpci- <dig> bac library identified  <dig> clones . a full-length cdna for akr1c <dig>   <cit>  probed against one third of the porcine chori- <dig> bac library identified seven clones . three of these clones  are represented in contig  <dig> of pig bac fingerprint map  <cit> . southern analysis of a bamhi digest of  <dig> clones from both libraries using the same cdna probe showed 5– <dig> shared bands and dissimilar banding patterns. five of these bacs from the chori- <dig> library  were digested with bamhi and hindiii and subcloned for sample sequencing. one bac clone  that contained at least  <dig> akr1c genes was nebulized and subcloned into pbluescript to obtain more coverage. the complete akr1c <dig> gene was pcr cloned by amplification using exon primers and the rpci44-125a <dig> bac clone as template. exon sequences for akr1cl <dig>  akr1c <dig>  akr1c <dig> and akr1c <dig> were found in  <dig> of the  <dig> chori- <dig> bac subclone libraries  and akr1c <dig> sequence was found in chori-242-264h <dig> subclones exclusively. akr1c <dig> was found in both sets of bacs in the overlapping region. sequences corresponding to akr1cl <dig> were not found in bac subclones. the promoter region of akr1c <dig> was cloned by probing bamhi/bglii digests of the rpci bacs with a fragment containing exon  <dig> and part of intron  <dig>  the promoter contained lsf , ere  and multiple sp <dig> and myc sites . a  <dig> bp contig from bac clone chori-242-203c <dig> upstream of akr1cl <dig> contained promoter elements ccaat, sp <dig>  ets, gata, nf- <dig> and ere   <cit> .

identification of cdnas for akr1c
tigr contigs were identified for four of the five akr1c genes identified from bac subclone sequence; only akr1c <dig> was not represented in est libraries sequenced or in contigs assembled by tigr. these mrnas were confirmed by rt-pcr of overlapping fragments or by completely sequencing individual clones. amino acid and nucleotide homologies ranged from about 50–90% and 73–93%, respectively, among the pig akr1c transcripts and the presence of active site residues common to aldo-keto reductases was conserved . no additional ests that would represent akr1cl <dig> or other akr1c genes were identified by sequence similarity analyses. because of the high homology of these genes to all of the human akr1c genes they were named by their relative position and conservation of amino acid sequence with human genes. the identity of pig akr1cl <dig> could be confidently assigned; pig akr1cl <dig> was most similar to human akr1cl <dig> and mouse akr1e <dig>  and had little similarity to other human akr1c genes. the pig akr1c <dig> followed by akr1c <dig> was the most similar to human akr1c genes  and to bovine akr1c genes; pig akr1c <dig> was more closely related to human akr1c <dig> and akr1cl <dig>  except for akr1cl <dig>  paralogues were more similar within species than were homologues among species.

mapping and gene organization
snps identified in three of the five genes  and microsatellites sb88- <dig>  found in bac subclone sequences were linkage mapped to ssc <dig>  positions 126– <dig> cm. the resolution of the map was not great enough to determine order of genes or markers. four akr1c genes  and microsatellite markers sb <dig>  sb <dig> and sb <dig>  were mapped using the imprh7000rad and imnprh212000rad radiation hybrid panels and anchored with flanking genes  and microsatellite markers swr <dig> and sw <dig> . the resolution of the imnprh212000rad panel was nearly the same as that of the imprh7000rad panel. comparison of sample sequence data with mrna sequences and the porcine bac fingerprint map showed that the complete cluster of genes resides in two overlapping bac clones that were subcloned, chori-242-203c <dig> and 264h20; clones 226i <dig>  315d <dig> and 319p <dig> completely overlap 203c <dig> . akr1cl <dig>  akr1c <dig>  akr1c <dig> and akr1c <dig> were all contained within chori- <dig> 203c <dig> and microsatellite markers sb <dig>  sb <dig> and sb <dig> were identified from this clone, as well. the gene order was determined to be akr1c <dig>  akr1c <dig>  akr1c <dig>  akr1c <dig> and akr1cl <dig> from centromere to telomere. bac clone chori-242-264h <dig> contained akr1c <dig>  akr1c <dig>  the urocortin  <dig> , tubulin alpha-like  <dig>  and neuroepithelial cell transforming gene  <dig>  genes . the orientation of the akr1c genes was determined by aligning cdnas or bac subclone contigs with bes on the bac fingerprint map  <cit> . this region corresponds to about  <dig> kb of human sequence  but is contained in only two porcine bac clones, average insert size of  <dig> kb, suggesting that this region is about half the size in the pig. a portion of this reduction is possibly due to the lack of a pig homologue to human akr1cl <dig>  although it is possible that akr1cl <dig> was missed in the bac sequence survey.

expression of pig akr1c genes in different adult tissues
gene-specific cdna for the five different akr1c genes was amplified from  <dig> tissues . six tissues expressed all five genes tested  and akr1cl <dig> and akr1c <dig> were the most widely expressed genes . akr1cl <dig> was expressed in all tissues except pancreas and brain. unlike human akr1c <dig>  pig akr1c <dig> expression was not specific to the liver but was expressed in all tissues and akr1c <dig> was the only other akr1c gene expressed in brain. these expression patterns were also reflected by the number of clones and tissue source of the est libraries from which these cdnas were identified  <cit> .

association of snps with phenotypic traits
polymorphisms were identified from rt-pcr sequences of meishan and white composite endometrium cdna. snps identified in the coding region were genotyped across generations f <dig> and f <dig> of the resource population. additional snps were found by sequencing genomic dna from animals of similar breed types and were chosen based on their frequency and potential for being a non-synonymous mutation . twelve snps were genotyped for association with reproductive traits. three of these were in the akr1c <dig> coding region, one was in akr1cl <dig>  and eight were the akr1c <dig> gene, including one in the promoter region . one snp , an isoleucine to phenylalanine substitution in akr1c <dig>  was associated with age of puberty  and possibly ovulation rate . another snp in akr1c <dig>  was possibly associated with age at puberty . two other snp were significantly associated with nipple number .

discussion
as in other species, this gene cluster is conserved in the pig, although individual family members have undergone some sequence divergence and specialization of tissue expression, possibly due to duplication of function. because of high sequence similarity of the genes within species and divergence among species, it is difficult to definitively assign homologues for all members of the gene family and not all genes are represented in the pig  that are found in human or mouse. gene duplication usually results in tandem duplication of genes or segments along the chromosome  <cit>  and gene conversion can result in a species paralogues being more closely related than homologues among species  <cit> . because these genes are expressed in a multitude of tissues and the expression patterns in pig tissues do not differentiate these genes with expression patterns described in human or mouse, assignment of homologues is even more complicated. in addition, the orientation of genes in this cluster is not identical to human or mouse gene order, while gene order of flanking genes  is conserved  <cit> . as more species are fully sequenced, a clearer picture of the evolutionary process of this gene family can be drawn.

because this pluripotent family of enzymes regulates steroid hormone action in a tissue-specific manner, they are compelling positional candidates for regulating reproductive functions  <cit> . steroid metabolites of akr1c enzymes rise at the onset of puberty  <cit>  presumably due to increased substrate and enzyme activity. the onset of puberty is marked by hormonal changes directed by neuronal signals that result in activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and reproductive maturity  <cit> . central to behavioral and gonadal maturity is the release of gonadotropin releasing hormone  followed by synthesis and secretion of luteinizing hormone  and follicle stimulating hormone . an lh surge in turn is essential for stimulating the cascade of events leading to ovulation  <cit> . the gonadal steroid 3alpha-hydroxy-4-pregnen-20-one  produced from progesterone by akr1c inhibits gnrh activity on gonadotropes and suppresses fsh release from pituitary cells  <cit> . modulation of the gnrh pulse frequency could therefore cause variation in the timing of puberty. furthermore, as gnrh regulates fsh and lh release, it is possible that akr1c activity may affect the number of ova shed during an estrus. fsh secretion stimulates the development of antral follicles and fsh levels are greater in some lines of gilts with higher ovulation rate  <cit> .

qtl for nipple number have been identified on ssc10q and two snps in akr1c <dig> were significantly associated with nipple number. some of these qtl are more proximally located on ssc10q  <cit> , but one identified in a meishan/pietrain cross maps to the same location as the akr1c gene cluster  <cit> . because androgen and antiandrogen treatment in rodents alters nipple development and retention  <cit> , and treatment of rats with an inhibitor of 5α-reductase during gestation inhibits male nipple regression  <cit> , a role for dihydrotestosterone  is implicated in normal nipple development. akrs convert dht, a preferred substrate, to the less active androgen 3α-androstanediol, thereby regulating steroid responsiveness in target tissues  <cit>  such that variation in akr1c activity could affect nipple development in the pig. akr1c <dig> is the most catalytically active isoform for dht reduction in human  <cit>  and has high expression in mammary tissue . because it is ubiquitously expressed and ests have been identified in porcine embryonic libraries  <cit> , it is probably expressed during embryonic development of mammary tissue.

considerable support for an association of the akr1c genotypes with nipple number was detected as well as some indication of an effect on age at puberty and possibly ovulation rate. age of puberty and ovulation rate at a specific age are negatively correlated traits in meishan pigs because ovulation rate increases from puberty to later estrus cycles  <cit>  and animals that reach puberty earlier will have had more cycles at the time of measurement and greater number of ova shed; however, this increase in ovulation rate is less dramatic in occidental pigs. because there was no selection performed on these animals and this is an area of increased recombination, it is assumed that recombination has greatly reduced linkage disequilibrium in this region, facilitating fine-mapping of reproductive traits in advanced generations  of this population. while genetic variation in this region appears to affect reproductive traits in swine there is little evidence that the snp markers tested are causative. rather, the estimated effects of akr1c genotypes show an overdominant effect on reproductive traits suggesting that these snps may be in incomplete linkage disequilibrium with the causal mutations or possibly there are multiple causative snps within this region acting in repulsion. further investigations are necessary to identify the causal mutations and understand the role akr1c genes have on these important reproductive traits.

CONCLUSIONS
variation in the aldo-keto reductase gene cluster on pig chromosome  <dig> may be associated with age of puberty, nipple number and ovulation rate in swine. future studies will determine if this variation will be useful for selection of breeding females with greater reproductive efficiency in industry populations.
