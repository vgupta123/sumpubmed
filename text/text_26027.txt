BACKGROUND
proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type  <dig>  is a proprotein convertase of the subtilase family  <cit> . it is synthesized as a soluble zymogen which undergoes autocatalytic intramolecular cleavage in the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . after cleavage, mature pcsk <dig> is efficiently secreted as a complex with its prosegment and can be found in the medium of cultured cells  <cit>  and in human plasma <cit> . by the use of subcellular fractionation, pcsk <dig> has been localized in endoplasmic reticulum and the intermediate vesicular compartment, but not in golgi cisternae  <cit> . even though the substrate for pcsk <dig> has not been identified, pcsk <dig> has been shown to play a role in cholesterol metabolism by regulating the number of cell surface low density lipoprotein receptors   <cit> . because pcsk <dig> reduces the number of ldlr without reducing the amount of ldlr mrna  <cit> , degradation of ldlr by pcsk <dig> is apparently a post-transcriptional event.

both the ldlr and the pcsk <dig> genes are transcriptionally regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein  <dig>  <cit> . thus, both genes are upregulated when intracellular levels of cholesterol are low. a role for pcsk <dig> in the regulation of serum cholesterol levels in humans, is demonstrated by the findings that mutations in the pcsk <dig> gene have been associated both with hypo-  <cit>  and hypercholesterolemia  <cit> . the mechanism by which some mutations cause hypocholesterolemia, and others cause hypercholesterolemia, is through reduced or increased ldlr-degrading activity, respectively  <cit> . a possible mechanism for the higher ldlr-degrading activity of the d374y mutant pcsk <dig>  is reduced inactivation by the proprotein convertases furin and/or pc5/6a  <cit> . for the s127r mutant, increased secretion of apolipoprotein b-containing lipoproteins may contribute to the hypercholesterolemia  <cit> .

degradation of the ldlr by pcsk <dig> is dependent on maintained catalytic activity of pcsk <dig>  <cit>  and appears to take place in a post-golgi compartment  <cit> . however, the exact location for the degradation has not been identified. we have previously shown that conditioned medium from hepg <dig> cells transiently transfected with a pcsk9-containing plasmid, reduces the amount of cell surface ldlr and internalization of ldl of untransfected hepg <dig> cells  <cit> . thus, pcsk <dig> or a factor acted upon by pcsk <dig>  is secreted from the transfected cells and degrades the ldlr either directly or indirectly. even though an acidic compartment seems to be involved in degradation of ldlr by pcsk <dig>  <cit> , studies of arh knock-out mice suggest that internalization of ldlr is not required for the ldlr to be degraded by pcsk <dig>  <cit> . thus, degradation may possibly take place on the cell membrane. however, no degradation products of the ldlr has been identified in culture medium of cells transfected with pcsk <dig> constructs. this indicates that pcsk <dig> may not simply cleave the ldlr on the cell surface or that the cleaved ldlr is rapidly degraded and has therefore escaped identification.

the ability of pcsk <dig> to degrade the ldlr is cell specific. overexpression of pcsk <dig> reduces the number of ldlr in liver and kidney cells <cit> , but not in fibroblasts  <cit> . it is therefore possible that pcsk <dig> may require another cell-specific protein to exert its effect on the ldlr. thus, the exact mechanism by which pcsk <dig> degrades the ldlr remains to be determined.

in this study we have examined the ldlr-degrading characteristics of conditioned medium from hepg <dig> cells transiently transfected with pcsk9-containing plasmids, to provide information about the mechanism by which pcsk <dig> degrades the ldlr. for these studies the pcsk <dig> cdna construct containing mutation d374y was primarily used because of its higher ldlr-degrading activity than the wild-type  pcsk <dig> construct  <cit> .

RESULTS
removal of pcsk9-his from conditioned medium restores internalization of ldl
pcsk <dig> could either degrade the ldlr by a direct interaction, or pcsk <dig> could act on other proteins that in turn cause degradation of the ldlr. studies were therefore performed to determine whether removal of pcsk <dig> from conditioned medium affected the ability of conditioned medum to reduce the internalization of ldl. for these studies, conditioned media were prepared from hepg <dig> cells transiently transfected with wt-pcsk9-his plasmid, d374y-pcsk9-his plasmid or with empty plasmid. the conditioned media were subjected to affinity chromatography using columns containing a nickel-chelating resin that binds his-tagged fusion proteins. western blot analysis showed that all wt-pcsk9-his and d374y-pcsk9-his of the conditioned medium, had been removed from the conditioned medium by the affinity chromatography . the slight upward shift of the band corresponding to the mature pcsk <dig> in the medium, as compared to the corresponding band in the lysate, is due to posttranslational modification of secreted pcsk <dig>  <cit> .

the effect of removing pcsk9-his from the conditioned media on the internalization of ldl, was determined by flow cytometry. conditioned medium containing wt-pcsk9-his or d374y-pcsk9-his, reduced the internalization of ldl by  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively, when compared to conditioned medium obtained from hepg <dig> cells transfected with empty plasmid . after removal of wt-pcsk9-his or d374y-pcsk9-his from the conditioned medium by affinity chromatography, the internalization of ldl was significantly increased . this post-affinity chromatographic increase in the internalization of ldl was significantly greater  than the post-affinity chromatographic increase in the internalization of ldl caused by d374y-pcsk9-flag which does not bind specifically to the nickel-chelating resin . these findings indicate that pcsk <dig> is the only protein in the conditioned medium that causes degradation of the ldlr.

to further study whether the ldlr-degrading factor of the conditioned medium was pcsk <dig> itself and not a second protein acted upon by pcsk <dig>  conditioned medium from hepg <dig> cells transiently transfected with d374y-pcsk9-flag was fractionated by gel filtration on a superdex  <dig> column. to determine the effect of the different fractions on the internalization of ldl, hepg <dig> cells were incubated with the individual fractions for  <dig> h at 37°c before the amount of ldl internalized was determined by flow cytometry. as can be seen from fig.  <dig>  cells incubated with fraction  <dig> had the lowest amount of ldl internalized. slightly smaller reductions in the amount of ldl internalized were observed with fractions  <dig> and  <dig>  proteins in fraction  <dig> have a molecular hydrodynamic volume similar to that of proteins with a molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda. western blot analysis of the fractions using an anti-flag antibody, showed that d374y-pcsk9-flag were found in fractions 17– <dig> with the highest amount in fraction  <dig> . thus, the ability of the fractions to reduce the internalization of ldl, closely paralleled the amount of pcsk <dig> in the fraction. this finding therefore supports the notion that degradation of the ldlr by pcsk <dig>  is caused by pcsk <dig> itself and not mediated by a second extracellular protein acted upon by pcsk <dig> 

pcsk <dig> does not degrade a secreted truncated ldlr
to study whether wt-pcsk <dig> or d374y-pcsk <dig> could degrade the ldlr independent of any intracellular compartments, a truncated ldlr  lacking the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the ldlr was used. upon synthesis, this truncated ldlr is secreted into the culture medium. taking advantage of this, we incubated medium containing ec-ldlr-his with conditioned media containing either wt-pcsk9-his or d374y-pcsk9-his. conditioned medium from hepg <dig> cells transfected with empty-plasmid was used as a control. after incubation, the amount of ec-ldlr-his was determined by western blot analysis using an anti-ldlr antibody. as can be seen from figure 4a, no significant difference in the amount of ec-ldlr-his was detected after incubation with conditioned medium containing wt-pcsk9-his or d374y-pcsk9-his. this finding therefore suggests that pcsk <dig> does not degrade the ldlr by a direct action on the extracellular part of the ldlr. however, it is possible that degradation of the ldlr on the cell surface by pcsk <dig> could require the presence of other cell membrane proteins.

pcsk <dig> in conditioned medium does not degrade the ldlr of membrane fractions
in order to determine whether pcsk <dig> could degrade the ldlr in the presence of other membrane proteins, membrane fractions from hepg <dig> cell were prepared by ultracentrifugation. the membrane fractions were incubated with conditioned medium from hepg <dig> cells transiently transfected with empty plasmid, wt-pcsk9-his plasmid or d374y-pcsk9-his plasmid. western blot analyses were performed to determine the amount of ldlr in the membrane fractions after incubation with the conditioned media. as can be seen from figure 4b, the presence of pcsk <dig> in the conditioned media did not reduce the amount of ldlr in the membrane fractions. this finding indicates that even in the presence of other membrane proteins, pcsk <dig> does not degrade the ldlr on the cell surface. thus, it seems that intact cells with intracellular compartments are required for the pcsk9-mediated degradation of the ldlr.

pcsk9-mediated degradation of ldlr occurs independently of clathrin-coated pits
to study whether endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits is required for the pcsk9-mediated intracellular degradation of the ldlr, conditioned medium was made hypertonic by adding  <dig> mmol/l of nacl in order to rapidly and reversibly block clathrin-coated pit formation  <cit> . as a consequence of disruption of clathrin-coated pits, the ldlr are distributed over the entire cell surface  <cit> . in untransfected hepg <dig> cells incubated with hypertonic, conditioned medium from hepg <dig> cells transiently transfected with empty plasmid, the amount of ldl internalized was reduced to 12%  as compared to regular, isotonic conditioned medium . similar reduction in the internalization of ldl was also observed with hypertonic, conditioned medium from hepg <dig> cells transiently transfected with wt-pcsk9-flag or d374y-pcsk9-flag plasmids . thus, when the conditioned medium was made hypertonic, the ldlr-mediated uptake of ldl was severely reduced due to lack of ldlr-mediated endocytosis of ldl through clathrin-coated pits.

when the media were made hypertonic, the amount of cell surface ldlr was reduced by 57%  and 45%  in hepg <dig> cells incubated with conditioned medium from hepg <dig> cells transfected with empty plasmid or the wt-pcsk9-his plasmid, respectively . in hepg <dig> cells incubated with d374y-pcsk9-his conditioned medium, no significant change in the amount of cell surface ldlr was observed in hypertonic medium. moreover, the amount of cell surface ldlr in hypertonic d374y-pcsk9-his medium remained significantly  lower than the corresponding value obtained with hypertonic, conditioned medium from hepg <dig> cells transfected with empty plasmid . thus, endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits does not seem to be a prerequisite for the intracellular degradation of the ldlr by pcsk <dig> 

to further study whether pcsk <dig> could enter hepg <dig> cells independently of clathrin-coated pits, the uptake of a red-tagged pcsk <dig> fusion protein  was studied by flow cytometry in hepg <dig> cells incubated with isotonic or hypertonic medium. the amount of wt-pcsk9-red internalized is the difference between cell-associated wt-pcsk9-red at 37°c and at 4°c. as can be seen from fig.  <dig>  hepg <dig> cells incubated with hypertonic medium containing wt-pcsk9-red, was able to take up wt-pcsk9-red although to a slightly lower extent  than cells incubated with isotonic medium. thus, pcsk <dig> is able to enter hepg <dig> cells independently of clathrin-coated pits.

nocodazole or ammonium chloride inhibits degradation of the ldlr
conditioned medium from hepg <dig> cells transiently transfected with the d374y-pcsk9-flag plasmid, reduced the total amount of ldlr of untransfected hepg <dig> cells by 40%  compared to conditioned medium from cells transfected with empty plasmid . in contrast, conditioned medium from hepg <dig> cells transiently transfected with the d374y-pcsk9-flag plasmid did not reduce the amount of cell membrane transferrin receptor . studies by others have suggested that degradation of the ldlr by pcsk <dig> takes place in an acidic intracellular compartment, possibly the lysosome  <cit> . intracellular transport of an ldlr-containing endosome to the lysosomes requires intact microtubules that are disrupted by nocodazole  <cit> . to study whether nocodazole affected the ldlr-degrading activity of the conditioned medium, hepg <dig> cells were incubated for  <dig> h with conditioned medium from hepg <dig> cells transiently transfected with the d374y-pcsk9-flag plasmid with or without addition of  <dig> μg/ml nocodazole. as can be seen in fig.  <dig>  nocodazole protected the ldlr from degradation by pcsk <dig>  nocodazole seemed to increase the amount of ldlr in cells incubated with conditioned medium from cells transfected with empty plasmid. addition of ammonium chloride which increases the ph of acidic compartments also protected the ldlr from degradation by the conditioned medium . the intracellular degradation of the ldlr by pcsk <dig> therefore seems to require transport along microtubules to an acidic compartment.

discussion
in this report we have performed studies of the ldlr-degrading activity of conditioned medium from hepg <dig> cells transiently transfected with pcsk9-containing plasmids. such conditioned medium efficiently degrades the ldlr of untransfected cells  <cit> . the pcsk <dig> plasmid containing the mutation d374y was primarily used as this mutant has a higher ldlr-degrading activity than wt-pcsk <dig>  <cit> .

a key question regarding the mechanism by which pcsk <dig> degrades the ldlr, is whether pcsk <dig> acts directly upon the ldlr or whether it activates another protein which in turn causes degradation of the ldlr. to answer this question, the effect of conditioned medium on the ldlr was studied after d374y-pcsk9-his had been removed by affinity chromatography. the results clearly showed that removal of wt-pcsk9-his or d374y-pcsk9-his almost completely abolished the ability of conditioned medium to reduce the internalization of ldl. this indicates that the ldlr-degrading activity of pcsk <dig> is not mediated by another protein in the culture medium. the results of gel filtration of conditioned medium from hepg <dig> cells transiently transfected with d374y-pcsk9-flag, showed that the ldlr-degrading activity of the fractions closely paralleled the amount of d374y-pcsk9-flag in the fractions. this finding shows that pcsk <dig> purified by gel filtration degrades the ldlr when added back to cultured cells. moreover, it suggests that pcsk <dig> degrades the ldlr in a dose-dependent manner. this finding also supports the notion that pcsk <dig> is the only extracellular protein involved in the degradation of ldlr. the possibility that the active form of pcsk <dig> was pcsk <dig> complexed with another soluble protein is unlikely as the proteins of the fraction obtained by gel filtration which had the highest ldlr-degrading activity, had a molecular hydrodynamic volume similar to that of proteins with a molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda. this is close to the molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda of mature pcsk <dig> complexed to its prosegment  <cit> . together, these data indicate that pcsk <dig> is the only extracellular protein which causes degradation of the ldlr. these data also indicate that pcsk <dig> appears extracellularly as a monomer, and is not complexed to another protein. consequently, the explanation for the cell-specific effect of pcsk <dig> on degradation of the ldlr, does not appear to be that pcsk <dig> requires a secreted cell-specific protein to degrade the ldlr. however, it is possible that pcsk <dig> may require the presence of cell-specific membrane-bound or cytosolic proteins to degrade the ldlr.

the failure of the secreted, truncated ldlr , which lacks the cytoplasmic and membrane-spanning domains, to be degraded when incubated with conditioned medium, indicates that pcsk <dig> does not degrade the ldlr directly by acting on the extracellular part of the ldlr. it is possible that degradation of the ldlr on the cell surface, could require a cell membrane protein not present in the pure preparation of the truncated ec-ldlr-his. however, incubation of membrane fractions with conditioned media did not lead to degradation of the ldlr of the membrane fractions. thus, even in the presence of other membrane proteins, pcsk <dig> does not degrade the cell surface ldlr. it therefore seems that pcsk <dig> and/or the ldlr need to be internalized in order for pcsk <dig> to degrade the ldlr.

our finding that d374y-pcsk9-his was able to reduce the number of cell surface ldlr even when clathrin-coated pits were blocked by hypertonic medium, suggests that the intracellular degradation of the ldlr by pcsk <dig> does not involve endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits. this finding is therefore in agreement with the finding that functional arh is not required for pcsk <dig> to degrade the ldlr in mice overexpressing pcsk <dig>  <cit> . however, these findings are at variance with the finding of lagace et al.  <cit> , which was published during review of our paper, who found that functional arh is required for pcsk <dig> to degrade the ldlr when added exogenously to primary hepatocytes. the explanation for these conflicting data could be that compensatory clathrin-independent endocytotic pathways may become activated when the clathrin-coated pits are artificially blocked or when pcsk <dig> is overexpressed. the notion that the intracellular degradation of the ldlr may be independent of how the ldlr and pcsk <dig> enter the cells, is supported by the findings in hep- <dig> cells where molecules endocytosed through clathrin-independent mechanisms were delivered to endosomes containing cargo which had been endocytosed through clathrin-coated pits  <cit> . even though our studies show that clathrin-independent endocytosis is able to mediate the degradation of the ldlr by pcsk <dig>  it is still possible that clathrin-dependent endocytosis may be the predominant pathway by which ldlr and pcsk <dig> enter the cells in vivo.

both we, in this study, and others  <cit>  have found that addition of ammonium chloride protects the ldlr from pcsk9-mediated degradation. this suggests that an acidic compartment is involved in the degradation of the ldlr. together with our finding that nocodazole also protects the ldlr from degradation, transport of endosomes containing ldlr along microtubules to an acidic compartment seems to be involved in the degradation of ldlr by pcsk <dig>  this notion is supported by the findings of benjannet et al.  <cit>  who have found present pcsk <dig> in both early and late endosomes. it is also supported by the recent data of lagace et al.  <cit>  who found that pcsk <dig> and ldlr associate and can be found in late endocytic compartments. they also found that administration of purified pcsk <dig> to the medium of hepg <dig> cells, reduced the number of cell surface ldlr in a dose- and time-dependent manner. thus, it may seem that pcsk <dig> has to be secreted and taken up by the cells in order to shuttle the ldlr from recycling endosomes to a late endosomes and eventually to lysosomes. however, more studies are needed to determine the exact mechanisms by which pcsk <dig> degrades the ldlr intracellularly.

CONCLUSIONS
degradation of the ldlr by pcsk <dig> is not mediated by a secreted protein acted upon by pcsk <dig> extracellularly. also the pcsk9-mediated degradation of the ldlr does not take place on the cell surface. rather, the pcsk9-mediated degradation of the ldlr appears to take place intracellularly and occurs even when endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits is blocked by hypertonic medium.
