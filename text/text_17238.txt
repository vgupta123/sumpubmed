BACKGROUND
gastric cancer is one of the most notorious cancers worldwide. it is the fourth most frequently occurring cancer, and the second most common cause of death for both sexes among all cancers, claiming over  <dig>  lives worldwide in  <dig>  <cit> . however, anti-cancer drug development of gastric cancer today remains slow and costly, and drug-resistance remains a potential obstacle  <cit> .

tanshinone iia  is a diterpene quinone extracted from the plant danshen , which is used in traditional chinese medicine  <cit> . the first usage of danshen extractions as herbal medicine can be traced back to more than 1800 years ago  <cit> . its applications include prevention of cardiac diseases  <cit> , protection of the nervous system  <cit>  and hepatocytes  <cit> , and inhibition of osteoporosis  <cit> . drug repositioning is considered to be a promising and valuable method for the reduction of the side effects and cost of anti-cancer drug research and development. the functions of many chemicals extracted from danshen are therefore explored for their anti-cancer potential, and tiia is the most abundant and structurally representative of these  <cit> . tiia has been recently reported to have anti-cancer potential against several cancers including breast cancer  <cit> , prostate cancer  <cit> , colorectal cancer  <cit> , lung cancer  <cit> , liver cancer  <cit> , leukemia  <cit> , and gastric cancer  <cit> . however, the regulatory mechanism of tiia in gastric cancer cells remains unclear.

metabolic transformation accompanying nutritional imbalance is one of the leading causes of cancer progression. glucose is a primary source for the pentose phosphate pathway, which makes rna and dna. glycolytic intermediates can be used to assist lipid biosynthesis to produce atp and non-essential amino acids, such as alanine, for growth  <cit> . proliferating cells are commonly maintained by enhancing aerobic glycolysis, also called the warburg effect, which causes lactate accumulation and contributes to the development of malignancies. in oncogenic pathways, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases /protein kinase b  has been shown to enhance glycolysis, while the tumor suppressor p <dig> inhibits it, suggesting a glycolytic switch intrinsically associated with oncogenic transformation  <cit> . through the inference of oncogene expression and glucose metabolism, the supply of nutrients to cancer cells could be blocked, which would stunt their proliferative potential. this may be an important finding for drug discovery.

high-throughput data can be used to provide a comprehensive inventory of all the biological processes of cells, display their complexity, and increase data accuracy. an accurate picture of the differential expression of experimental samples is important for defining precise targets and networks. here we use two types of high-throughput data to uncover the regulatory mechanism of tiia in gastric cancer cells: transcription levels from next-generation sequencing  data, and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification -based quantitative proteomics analysis. ngs is one of newer transcriptome sequencing approaches and can perform high-throughput sequencing by generating thousands or millions of sequences in parallel  <cit> . it has better sensitivity and lower background noise than microarray analysis, and more researchers are using it to investigate the mechanisms of anti-cancer drugs  <cit> . itraq is a promising new technique for quantitative proteomics which can quantify proteins from different sources using their different tags  <cit> . because of its sensitivity in labeling peptides, it is considered a more powerful quantitative proteomic technique than others, including the two frequently used quantitative proteomics techniques 2d-dige  and cicat   <cit> .

in this study, we identified a total of  <dig>  unique transcripts and  <dig> tiia-regulated proteins that are involved in glucose metabolic process. we further investigated and found that tiia blocks glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in cancer cells by altering protein expression, and causes dna damage, cell cycle arrest, cytoskeleton reorganization and apoptosis.

RESULTS
tiia reduces the growth rate and suppresses proliferation of gastric cancer ags cells
to determine whether tiia can affect gastric cancer cell survival, we treated ags cells with different concentrations to detect real-time cell growth rates by an rtca  system. the ic <dig> of tiia at 48 hr was calculated to be  <dig>  μm. figure 1a shows that  <dig>  μm tiia was only slightly effective, whereas 10 μm tiia killed almost all cells. each curve is significantly different from the other . our results demonstrate that the cell growth rate was significantly decreased under tiia treatment conditions compared with controls, suggesting that ags cell growth was significantly inhibited by tiia in a dose-dependent manner.figure  <dig> 
effects of tiia on cell growth and proliferation of ags cells.  growth curves show a dosage-dependent pattern of growth inhibition after tiia treatment for 72 hr. all tiia treatment conditions had significant effects on ags cell growth . cell indexes of ags cells were measured by an rtca dp® system, expressed as mean ± sd of three replications.  colonies of ags cells were stained by crystal violet  after tiia treatment. control conditions exhibit many colonies, while ic <dig> tiia conditions have produced almost no colonies.  tiia significantly reduces the number of ags colonies  in a dosage-dependent manner. histogram values are expressed as mean ± sd from three replications.



to explore whether tiia could affect gastric cancer cell proliferation rates, we treated ags cells at different concentrations of tiia and counted the number of cell colonies stained with crystal violet. the results show that  <dig>  μm  tiia reduces colonies to about 60%, whereas  <dig>  μm  tiia results in almost no colonies. it indicates that the proliferation rate of ags cells was significantly suppressed by tiia in a dose-dependent manner  .

functional annotation enrichment of tiia -regulated genes
to uncover the tiia regulatory mechanism in ags cells, we performed rna-seq analysis to profile the transcriptomes of gastric cancer cells when treated with dimethyl sulfoxide   or with tiia. in order to characterize the gene expression profile to response of biological functions, our initial analysis performed functional enrichment of all identified genes onto metacore pathway analysis. major bio-functional networks were significantly enriched and showed in figure 2a. of six bio-functional networks, “catabolic process” is top-ranked. previous studies have shown that dysregulation of metabolism is an important indicator for tumorgenesis  <cit> . thus, we forced on metabolic networks to enrich all identified genes by metacore. as indicated in figure 2b, a large number of glucose networks were affected, including phosphatidylinositol- <dig> -diphosphate pathway, phosphatidylinositol- <dig> ,5-triphosphate pathway, ceramide pathway, pentose phosphate pathways and transport, glucose pathway, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and glucose transport, and sucrose metabolism and transport. it has been known that pi3k, an key enzyme of phosphatidylinositol- <dig> -diphosphate and phosphatidylinositol- <dig> ,5-triphosphate pathways, increases glycolysis in cancer cells  <cit> . based on these results, we propose that tiia-regulated pathways involving in the enriched glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and glucose transport network .figure  <dig>

moreover, a total of  <dig>  differentially expressed genes  were considered that have different expression between control and tiia treatment samples | ≥ 1) . among these,  <dig>  genes were up-regulated and  <dig>  genes were down-regulated by tiia. metacore networks analysis of degs reveals significantly enriched biological processes that frequently occur in gastric cancer cells with tiia treatment. as shown in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  major bio-functional networks were in correspondence with the enrichment analysis of integrative transcriptome , such as cell cycle_g2-m, dna damage_dbs repair, apoptotic nucleus, cytoskeleton_intermediate filaments.table  <dig>

proteomic expression profiling of tiia-treated gastric cells
to further elucidate cellular mechanism and molecular function, we performed itraq-based proteomics analysis to assess the protein expression profiles in ags cells with tiia treatment. equal amounts of peptides collected from control samples or tiia-treated samples were labeled with itraq reagents, respectively, and used for replication . all labeled peptides were mixed and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry . a total of  <dig> differentially expressed proteins were identified with a false discovery rate  of  <dig> %; annotated ms/ms spectra are collected in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  there were 100% of identified peptides that were labeled with itraq reagents. the intensity levels of itraq signals distribution plots show that positive correlation among our treatments , suggesting that labeled samples with a high reproducibility were present in this study.table  <dig>

in order to validate itraq data, we evaluated certain identified protein expression patterns  by western blot analysis, including proteasome subunit β type- <dig> , 40s ribosomal protein s <dig>  and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase . in our ms/ms spectra, psmb <dig> , rs <dig>  and g6pi  displayed a high intensity across different samples. after western blotting analysis, psmb <dig> can be detected to be significantly up-regulated  whereas rs <dig>  and g6pi  were significantly down-regulated . as our results, expression patterns of psmb <dig>  rs <dig> and g6pi correspond with our itraq data for those proteins, suggesting the consistence between itraq and western blotting data.figure  <dig>

tiia suppresses glucose metabolism of gastric cancer cells
to delineate the mechanism of tiia in gastric cancer cells, we compared our quantitative proteomics and transcriptomics data. we found tiia regulated not only genes but also proteins involved in glycolysis, the cell cycle, apoptosis, dna damage and cytoskeleton rearrangement. as shown in figure 2c, five proteins  were identified at both the protein and transcription level. after western blotting analysis, we found that the protein expression of g6pi and ldhb was downregulated by tiia, and eno <dig> was not changed . because g6pi and ldhb are important enzymes in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, respectively, we further examined if tiia can regulate other proteins related to glucose metabolism, such as aldolase c , malate dehydrogenase  <dig> , phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  <dig>  and phosphoglycerate kinase  <dig> , which are involved in gluconeogenesis. aldoc and pck <dig> were also identified in our transcriptomics data . mdh <dig>  which reduces oxaloacetate to malate in the mitochondria, was downregulated by tiia. pck <dig>  which converts oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate, was up-regulated by tiia . the transformation of oncogenes, such as p <dig> and akt, is also involved in the glucose metabolism switch in cancer cells  <cit> . we found that p <dig> increased and akt decreased in gastric cancer cells following tiia treatment . additionally, tiia treatment significantly decreased the intracellular atp levels in ags cells compared with the control sample .figure  <dig> 
treatment with tiia changes the expression of glucose metabolism-related proteins in ags cells.  the expression of itraq-identified proteins, ldhb and eno <dig> was estimated using western blotting.  the expression of aldoc, mdh <dig>  pck <dig> and pgk <dig> in ags cells treated with tiia was estimated using western blotting. the levels of  tumor suppressor gene, p <dig>  and the oncogene akt, and  intracellular atp, were examined in ags cells treated with tiia. β-actin was used as an internal control.



tiia arrests the cell cycle at the g2/m phase transition
the ability to monitor response to regulation of the cell cycle is an enriched function from our transcriptomics data . we treated ags cells with different concentrations of tiia and measured dna distributions by using flow cytometry to detect the cell cycle distribution of a population of cancer cells. the percentage of ags cells in the g2/m phase increased up to  <dig> % above control levels after  <dig>  μm tiia treatment, showing that tiia induces cell cycle arrest of ags at g2/m in a dosage-dependent manner .figure  <dig>

/m transition in ags cells.  flow cytometric analysis shows the distribution of dna content in ags cells after 48 h of tiia treatment. cellular dna was stained by pi and analyzed to quantify the percentage of cells in certain cell cycle phases using fcs express  <dig>  the percentage of ags cells in the g2/m phase transition increases along with increases in tiia treatment concentrations, exhibiting a dosage-dependent relationship. the percentage of cells in the sub-g <dig> phase also increases, from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % , suggesting the occurrence of apoptosis.  protein levels of phospho-cdk , total cdk, cyclin b <dig> and cdc 25c were analyzed using western blotting. β-actin was used as an internal control.



as indicated in table  <dig>  cdk <dig>  cyclin b <dig> and cdc25c are associated with the cell cycle at the g2/m phase, and were identified in our transcriptomics data. cdk <dig> activation can regulate the progression of the cell cycle from the g <dig> to the m phase, which is dependent on coordination with cyclin b  <cit> . the activation of the cdk1/cyclin-b complex is maintained through phosphorylation of thr <dig> and dephosphorylation of thr <dig> and tyr <dig> in cdk <dig>  dephosphorylation of thr <dig> and tyr <dig> in cdk <dig> is catalyzed by phosphatase cdc25c, which is considered a rate-limiting step for the g <dig> to m phase transition  <cit> . previous reports suggest monitoring the alteration of cdk <dig>  cyclin b <dig>  cdc25c, and phospho-cdk <dig>  protein expressions is a useful way to validate the occurrence of cell cycle arrest at the g2/m transition  <cit> . for these reasons, to confirm whether tiia induces cell cycle arrest at g2/m in gastric cancer cells, we treated ags cells with tiia at a concentration of  <dig>  μm , and then measured protein expression levels using western blotting analysis. levels of phospho-cdk <dig> , cyclin b <dig>  and cdc25c were all reduced in cells treated with tiia . our results indicate that tiia treatment induced characteristic cell cycle arrest at g2/m in ags cells by altering cyclin b <dig> and cdc25c expression as well as the phosphorylation of cdk <dig> 

tiia treatment causes apoptosis and reorganization of actin filaments and microtubules
our cell cycle analysis also indicated that levels of cells in the sub-g <dig> phase were increased  <dig> % above control levels under 5 μm tiia treatment conditions . a significant increase of cells in the sub-g <dig> phase is widely accepted as a sign of apoptosis induction  <cit> . as our transcriptomics and proteomics data  show, apoptosis-related genes could be induced by tiia. we treated ags cells at different concentrations of tiia and detected the proportions of cells undergoing apoptosis or necrosis using flow cytometry. our results show that the proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis  significantly increased by  <dig> % above control levels under  <dig>  μm tiia treatment conditions, showing that tiia induced apoptosis of ags cells in a dosage-dependent manner .figure  <dig> 
tiia induces apoptosis and reorganization of cytoskeleton in ags cells.  ags cells were treated with different levels of tiia . treated cells were stained with annexin a <dig> and pi and their apoptotic condition was analyzed by flow cytometry. ea denotes early apoptosis; la denotes late apoptosis.  images of ags cells were obtained by fluorescence microscopy after tiia treatment for 48 hr. nuclei were stained with dapi , actin filaments were stained with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin , and microtubules were stained with mouse anti-α-tubulin antibody and the corresponding fitc-conjugated secondary anti-mouse igg antibody . arrows indicate nuclear fragmentation sites with condensed chromatin. microtubules are densely packed at these sites; this condensation is an important step during the apoptotic process  <cit> . scale bars represent 10 μm.



it is widely understood that reorganization of the cytoskeleton, including actin filaments and microtubules, plays a crucial role in apoptosis  <cit> . links between this process and tiia treatment can be seen in our transcriptomics and proteomics data . to detect whether the cytoskeletons of ags cells undergo reorganization after tiia exposure, we treated ags cells with tiia at different concentrations, then examined the consequent distribution of actin filaments and microtubules using immunofluorescence staining. many cells were seen to manifest shrinking morphology after tiia treatment . actin filaments under tiia treatment became more condensed, especially at the cell periphery, and underwent crumbling. on the other hand, microtubules aggregated to become thick bundles, and were distributed along nuclear fragmentation sites with condensed chromatin . these kinds of cytoskeletal reorganizations, combined with nuclear fragmentation, are all characteristic of apoptosis  <cit> , showing that tiia induced cytoskeleton reorganization arising from apoptosis in ags cells.

tiia triggers γ-h2ax nuclear foci in response to dna double strand breaks
based on our previous results, tiia could induce dna damage in gastric cancer cells . dna damage, including double strand breaks , often leads to genetic instability; proper cellular responses to dna damage are crucial for cell function and survival  <cit> . previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of the histone variant h2ax, producing γ-h2ax at nuclear foci, plays an important role in the dna damage response triggered by dsb  <cit> . the change in h2ax levels was also apparent in our data . to examine whether tiia triggers dna damage in gastric cancer cells, we treated ags cells with different levels of tiia to examine the subsequent localization of γ-h2ax using immunofluorescence staining. numerous γ-h2ax foci were localized in the nuclei of tiia treated cells, while γ-h2ax was only represented in a few foci in control cells . increased protein expression of γ-h2ax was also detected in tiia-treated cells . these results suggest that tiia triggers dsb, triggering a dna damage response in ags cells.figure  <dig> 
tiia triggers dna double-strand breaks in ags cells.  images of ags cells were obtained by fluorescence microscopy after 48 hr of tiia treatment. nuclei were stained with dapi , actin filaments were stained with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin , and γ-h2ax were stained with mouse anti-γ-h2ax antibody and the corresponding fitc-conjugated secondary anti-mouse igg antibody . each zoomed panel shows representative γ-h2ax distributions in detail. scale bars represent 10 μm.  protein expression of γ-h2ax increases under an ic <dig> dose of tiia; samples were analyzed by western blotting with β-actin as internal control. histogram values for fold change are expressed as mean ± sd from three independent experiments.



discussion
botanical herbs have been used for disease treatment and prevention, and as alternative and complementary therapies  <cit> . for instance, paclitaxel isolated from one kind of botanical herb, taxus brevifolia, has been used as second-line chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent gastric cancer  <cit> . in this study, we treated gastric cancer with tiia, which can be used to improve heart function by limiting apoptosis or oxidative damage  <cit> . recently, many studies have shown that tiia exhibits anti-tumor potential  <cit> , and that on cancers such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, and leukemia, it can induce the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway  <cit> . in mkn <dig> gastric cancer cells, tiia was reported to inhibit cell growth, induce g2/m cell cycle arrest and apoptosis  <cit> . however, few of them actually constructed possible pathways or mechanisms in gastric cancer.

genes for glycolysis are overexpressed in 70% of all human cancers worldwide, including gastric cancer  <cit> . by comparing our transcriptomics and proteomics data, we are the first to propose that the transformation of glucose metabolism, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in gastric cancer cells is a major biological process that is regulated by tiia treatment. an enzyme involved in glycolysis, g6pi, catalyzes the reversible isomerization of glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate, and is downregulated by tiia  <cit> . increased synthesis of g6pi, known as autocrine motility factor , is considered to be a unique feature of cancer cells, which stimulates cell growth and contributes to cancer metastasis and malignancy  <cit> . amf can also down-regulate caspase- <dig> and apaf- <dig>  making cancer cells more resistant to mitochondria-dependent apoptosis  <cit> . previous studies have reported that tiia can induce mitochondria-dependent apoptosis by regulating caspase- <dig> and apaf- <dig> in several types of cancer  <cit> . in gastric cancer, we also found that tiia may induce apoptosis . based on our results, we suggest that tiia might induce the occurrence of apoptosis by suppressing g6pi expression, which decreases glucose consumption and inhibits glycolysis in cancer cells.

in gluconeogenesis, expression of ldhb, one of the subunits of lactate dehydrogenase , which converts lactate to pyruvate, was shown to decrease in ags cells after tiia treatment. pyruvate is the end product of glycolysis and contributes to gluconeogenesis, acetyl-coa which enters the krebs  cycle, lipid synthesis and nonessential amino acid synthesis for proliferative responses in tumor cells  <cit> . decreased ldhb expression might enhance negative regulation of the warburg effect, which mediates pyruvate into lactate and back in tumor cells  <cit> . in mouse immortalized cell lines, ldhb is critical in the mechanistic target of rapamycin  pathway to induce tumor formation  <cit> . ldhb is also considered as a tumor marker that increases in many cancers because it facilitates tumor growth and cell proliferation  <cit> . serum ldh is also considered to be predictors for overall survival of advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients  <cit> . in gastric cancer cells, we suggest that tiia treatment might block nutrient supply, which reduces cell survival and proliferation by causing lactate dehydrogenase deficiency.

mdh <dig> and pck <dig> in mitochondria are used to convert pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate. in colon cancer, increased mdh levels could enhance glycolysis and lead to cell proliferation and tumorigenesis  <cit> . silencing pck <dig> in colon cancer cells could reduce susceptibility to preoperative 5-fluorouracil-based radiation therapy  <cit>  and responses to high glucose levels  <cit> . in this study, we found that tiia treatment can decrease mdh <dig> expression and increase pck <dig> expression . increased pgk <dig> in gastric cancer is considered as a biomarker of advanced gastric cancer and is followed by increasing intracellular atp levels  <cit> . however, tiia reduced intracellular atp levels and slightly up-regulated pgk <dig>  which indicates that some functions of tiia are still unclear. moreover, the oncogene akt was down-regulated by tiia, which can stimulate aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells  <cit> , suggesting that tiia has the potential to be used as chemotherapy for gastric cancer because of its effectiveness in transforming glucose metabolism .figure  <dig> 
schematic representation of tiia blocking glucose metabolism in gastric cancer cells. in tumor cells, glucose is consumed to produce atp, and the glycolytic intermediates are used for biosynthetic pathways. proto-oncogene, akt, stimulates glycolysis and the tumor suppression gene, p <dig>  suppresses glucose metabolism via several pathways. after tiia treatment, intracellular atp levels and akt expression decreases, and p <dig> expression increases. in the second step of glycolysis, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, acting as an enzyme, was down-regulated by tiia treatment. we also found that tiia dysregulates gluconeogenesis by suppressing ldhb and mdh <dig> expression, and enhancing pck <dig> expression. tiia promotes the activity of these pathways to suppress cancer cell growth.



the glucose metabolic switch is associated with the cell cycle, apoptosis and dna repair in tumor cells  <cit> . our transcriptomics analyses and proteomics data also showed that tiia can regulate these functions and their related proteins, such as psmb <dig> and rs <dig>  previous studies have shown that the expression of psmb <dig> and rs <dig> is involved the development of cancer  <cit> . psmb <dig>  which belongs to the proteasome b-type family, was up-regulated by tiia. proteasomes are necessary for the dna damage response, and accumulate at double strand break sites to recruit other repair proteins  <cit> . tiia treatment increased the likelihood of the occurrence of dna damage in gastric cancer cells , which might stimulate cancer cells to increase psmb <dig> expression.

moreover, rs <dig>  as a cancer-related ribosomal protein, was down-regulated by tiia. increased rs <dig> is present when p <dig> mutates, which occurs in cell cycle progression or apoptosis in response to dna damage  <cit> . elevated expression of p <dig>  cell cycle arrest in the g2/m phase, apoptosis and cytoskeleton reorganization were observed in ags cells following tiia treatment. dna damage is one of the major causes of cell cycle arrest in the g2/m phase  <cit> . cytoskeleton reorganization, including the redistribution of actin and microtubules, is a characteristic of chromatin remodeling during apoptosis  <cit> . this has also been observed in cancer cells treated with clinical anti-cancer drugs, such as etoposide, doxorubicin and taxol  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we integrate transcriptomics and proteomics data to uncover tiia-regulated mechanisms in gastric cancer. in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, tiia reduces glucose consumption and the production of pyruvate by regulating g6pi, ldhb, mdh <dig>  pck <dig> and pgk <dig> expression. akt decreases and p <dig> increases in response to apoptosis and dna damage in gastric cancer cells following tiia treatment, while the glucose metabolism switch induced by the transformation of oncogenes is destroyed . we suggest that tiia treatment could cause cell stress, nutrient deficiency and dna damage, to induce cycle arrest at the g2/m transition, apoptosis and cytoskeleton reorganization, all of which would inhibit cell proliferation. in this study, we provide new insight into the tiia regulatory mechanism in gastric cancer cells, so that future cancer research can improve therapeutic strategies.
