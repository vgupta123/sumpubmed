BACKGROUND
ruminococci are established members of the gastrointestinal tract  microbiota of ruminants, hindgut-fermenters  <cit>  and monogastrics such as humans  <cit> . for example,  <dig> ruminococcus species are among the  <dig> bacteria that define the “core gut microbiome” found in 90% of humans  <cit> . the fibrolytic capabilities of many ruminococci make them key players in the dynamics of gut microbial communities and these bacteria have been linked to activities that influence gastrointestinal health in humans  as well as fiber degradation in ruminants. in the bovine rumen, ruminococci are major contributors to the conversion of fibrous feeds into the organic acids utilized by the host as nutrients  <cit> . importantly, ruminococci account for up to 10% of the 16s rrna gene copies in the bovine rumen, and play a fundamental role in cellulose degradation  <cit> . although ruminococcus isolates from the rumen can hydrolyze crystalline cellulose, their activity on other fibrous substrates has not been well-characterized  <cit> . investigating how ruminococci degrade fibers will facilitate our understanding of the role that this group plays in host nutrition. in addition, the fermentative capacity of ruminococci, including ethanol production by r. albus  <dig>  could inform industrial efforts to convert cellulosic material into commercially relevant bioproducts.

among the ruminococci, cellulose digestion is best characterized for r. flavefaciens
 <cit> . fiber adherence in r. flavefaciens is mediated in part by multienzyme complexes called cellulosomes. cellulosomes contain cell-anchored scaffold proteins that coordinate fibrolytic enzymes via interlocking dockerin and cohesin domains  <cit> . the scaffold and fibrolytic enzymes are attached to the substrate by carbohydrate binding modules , thus localizing the fibrolytic enzymes and hydrolytic products near the cell surface . however, the mechanism of adherence to cellulose for other ruminococci such as r. albus is less defined.

cellulosomes have been suspected in some strains of r. albus
 <cit> , but studies have failed to identify key cellulosomal components in these bacteria. for example, two cellulases were identified in r. albus  <dig> that lacked dockerin domains  <cit> , but instead contained a unique family  <dig> cbm found only among r. albus strains  <cit> . additionally, a pil-family protein was found to be involved in fiber adherence in r. albus  <dig>  <cit>  leading to the suggestion that a combination of cellulosomes, cell-anchored cellulases, and type iv pili may be involved in fiber adherence  <cit> . r. albus strains also produce a thick matrix of extracellular polysaccharide, called a glycocalyx, when grown on cellulose  <cit> . although details of the glycocalyx composition are known  <cit> , the role of the glycocalyx in fiber degradation has not been established.

given these observations, we hypothesized that r. albus  <dig> does not utilize cellulosomes to degrade crystalline cellulose. to test this, we compared the recently sequenced genome for this bacterium  <cit>  to the genome sequences of other cellulolytic and non-cellulolytic ruminococci and show the lack of complete canonical cellulosomes. we then performed a global transcriptomic analysis of r. albus  <dig> cultures grown on either cellulose or cellobiose to reveal previously unconsidered aspects of cellulose degradation by this bacterium. finally, we show that r. albus  <dig> utilizes, and produces ethanol from, a number of complex fibrous substrates in vitro. our results contribute to a revised model for fiber degradation by r. albus  <dig> and underscore the important role that ruminococci may play within the mammalian git microbiota.

RESULTS
r. albus <dig> and r. albus <dig> are distinct from that of r. flavefaciensfd-1
to assess the genomic differences between ruminant-derived ruminococci, we compared the genome sequences of three cellulolytic ruminococci: r. albus  <dig>  r. albus  <dig>  and r. flavefaciens fd- <dig>  we employed orthomcl, an analysis tool that identifies orthologs by collapsing paralogous proteins and orthologous proteins into orthologous clusters. using this method, organisms can be differentiated by the presence or absence of clusters. r. albus  <dig> and  <dig> shared nearly four times as many clusters with each other than with r. flavefaciens fd- <dig> . based on a protein family  annotation of these clusters, we found that some of the differences between r. flavefaciens and the r. albus strains included predicted carbohydrate-active enzymes . overall, we identified  <dig>  ortholog clusters common to all  <dig> bacterial strains,  <dig> of which contain open reading frames  predicted to code for cazymes. there were few ortholog clusters unique to each organism.figure  <dig> 
functional relationships between sequenced ruminococci. a) orthomcl was used to identify unique and shared proteins among three cellulolytic ruminococci: r. albus  <dig>  r. albus  <dig>  and r. flavefaciens fd- <dig>  total number of shared orthologous clusters within each group are indicated and the number of orthologous clusters annotated as carbohydrate-active enzymes are shown in parentheses. b) comparison of the three cellulolytic ruminococci  with non-fibrolytic ruminococci , and amylolytic ruminococcus bromii l2- <dig>  emphasized the number of carbohydrate-active enzymes that were specific to these physiologically distinct groups.



we further refined our cazyme-containing ortholog clusters to those specific for cellulose utilization by comparing them with five other non-cellulolytic ruminococci . more than half of the  <dig> cazymes common to the cellulolytic ruminococci were shared with non-cellulolytic ruminococci. as expected, many of these predicted cazymes were involved with general sugar metabolism, such as glycosyl transferases , carbohydrate esterases , or non-cellulolytic families of glycosyl hydrolases  and were therefore not considered further in this study. the remaining cazyme ortholog clusters are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> and include numerous cellulases, including three distinct clusters of gh <dig> cellulases that were common to each of the cellulolytic ruminococci. one of these clusters was similar to the dockerin-containing cel9a cellulase from ruminococcus albus f- <dig>  <cit> .

r. albusstrains lack most canonical cellulosome components
we investigated the relative abundance of core cellulosome components and cellulases within several sequenced clostridiales genomes. specifically, we chose organisms from the genera ruminococcus and clostridium that have well-characterized canonical cellulosomes , cellulolytic organisms not known to contain cellulosomes , and non-cellulolytic organisms . we performed a correlation-based clustering analysis and determined the relative similarity between these bacteria . despite the known diversity among molecular components of cellulosomes, all organisms with characterized cellulosomes that we tested formed a single group distinct from organisms that lacked characterized cellulosomes or from non-cellulolytic organisms. dockerins, cohesins, and cellulosomal cellulases were generally lacking among the non-cellulolytic organisms with the exception of the amylolytic r. bromii l2- <dig> that had numerous representatives in two of the dockerin families . the number of representatives in each of the cohesin and dockerin families and the gh <dig> family were higher among the organisms with canonical cellulosomes .figure  <dig> 
comparison of cellulolytic components between cellulolytic and non-cellulolytic bacteria. representatives from cellulolytic enzyme families  and cellulosome components  were tabulated in bacteria with unconfirmed cellulosomes , confirmed cellulosomes , and non-cellulolytic bacteria . sums in each category were used to generate a distance matrix that distinguished groups of these bacteria. although the cellulolytic clostridium phytofermentans isdg does not have a confirmed cellulosome, it is highlighted in black to emphasize its relative distinction from the other groups.



the r. albus strains we examined did not group with any of the cellulosome-containing or non-cellulolytic organisms. our analysis showed that both r. albus strains encode for dockerin-containing proteins, as has been noted previously  <cit> , but lacked representatives of the dockerin family ipr <dig> as well as in both cohesin families. only one putative cohesin  was found in r. albus  <dig> . moreover, homologs of recognized scaffoldin proteins from r. flavefaciens fd- <dig>  and c. thermocellum atcc  <dig>  were absent from the r. albus strains.

r. albus 7ferments ethanol and acetate from a wide range of substrates
r. albus  <dig> is known to produce ethanol, acetate, h <dig> and co <dig> from cellulose in pure culture  <cit> . we verified this and further tested a number of other polysaccharides by measuring ethanol, acetate, and reducing sugar concentrations in batch culture as shown in table  <dig>  we found that r. albus  <dig> hydrolyzed and utilized a variety of plant polysaccharides, including cellulose and hemicelluloses . the strain also fermented the storage polysaccharides lichenan , glucomannan , and the highly complex polysaccharides from soybeans . although r. albus  <dig> hydrolyzed citrus pectin and inulin  to generate reducing sugars, it did not utilize these substrates as shown by the absence of fermentation products. r. albus  <dig> did not hydrolyze or utilize resistant starch , complex branched polysaccharides , or the storage glucans curdlan  and laminarin . r. albus  <dig> produced a similar molar ratio  of ethanol:acetate regardless of substrate utilized despite slightly higher production of total fermentation products on lichenan and lower production of fermentation products on soy polysaccharides . the yield of ethanol produced by r. albus  <dig> per gram of crystalline cellulose was similar to the amount of ethanol produced by other reported ethanologenic cellulolytic organisms grown in batch culture .table  <dig>

continuous culture fermentations. steady-state cultures grown on cellulose showed a different fermentation pattern than batch cultures, producing more acetate than ethanol  with higher levels of each of these fermentation products. continuous cultures grown on cellulose consumed  <dig>  g cellulose/l, equivalent to  <dig>  mm glucose equivalents, and produced  <dig>  mm ethanol and  <dig>  mm acetate. continuous cultures grown on cellobiose consumed  <dig>  g glucose equivalents/l  and produced  <dig>  mm ethanol and  <dig>  mm acetate. cell protein concentrations from cellulose and cellobiose cultures were  <dig>  and  <dig>  g/l, equivalent to cell yields of  <dig>  and  <dig>  g/g glucose equivalent, respectively, assuming cells are 50% protein by dry weight.

the global r. albus <dig> transcriptome revealed differences in gene expression between cellulose- and cellobiose-grown cultures
to identify components important for cellulose degradation, we compared the transcriptome of r. albus  <dig> grown in either a cellulose- or cellobiose-limited chemostat culture. growth rate has been reported to influence cellulase expression in other cellulolytic organisms  <cit> , and thus a constant  <dig>  h- <dig> dilution rate was used for both cellulose and cellobiose in our substrate-limited chemostat. this allows for direct comparison of the effect of substrate type, independent of the confounding effect of growth rate that would result from batch culture cultivation. ribosome-free rna was purified from samples taken from steady-state cultures over three days on each substrate and subjected to high-throughput sequencing using illumina-based rna-seq, generating at least  <dig>  million reads per sample . in most cases, over 90% of the transcripts could be mapped back to the r. albus  <dig> genome sequence, with the remaining unmapped reads representing sequencing errors or unaligned reads due to snp variation. over half of the total transcripts were differentially expressed between cellobiose and cellulose substrates with nearly 28% of predicted proteins increased by two-fold or more in response to growth on cellulose . this broad transcriptional response spanned the entire chromosome as well as the four plasmids, and contained reproducible expression patterns across each replicate chemostat sample with the exception of one cellobiose sample . incompletely digested chromosomal dna or an rnaase may have contaminated this sample and it was not included in any further analysis. predicted open reading frames  with lower transcription on cellulose, as compared to cellobiose, are described in additional file 1: supplementary information  <dig> and table s <dig> 

increased transcription of cellulases during r. albus <dig> growth on cellulose compared to cellobiose
thirteen predicted cazymes, including cellulases and hemicellulases, exhibited greater than 4-fold higher transcription when grown on cellulose, as compared to cellobiose. all of the  <dig> predicted cellulases encoded by the r. albus  <dig> genome sequence had higher transcription on cellulose than cellobiose, although only  <dig> exhibited greater than 4-fold expression . these included two gh <dig> cellulases  and two gh <dig> cellulases . fourteen of the twenty-seven predicted cellulases were not differentially expressed  and none of the predicted cellulases had lower transcription when r. albus  <dig> was grown on cellulose. using the pred-tat software  <cit> , we found that all of the predicted cellulases and hemicellulases contained signal peptides for sec-dependent secretion .table  <dig>

of the cazymes found to be up-regulated on cellulose, relative to cellobiose, all but one contained one or more cbm <dig> domains. we identified  <dig> proteins containing one or more cbm <dig> domains in the r. albus  <dig> genome sequence, and  <dig> of them had more than 2-fold higher transcription when grown on cellulose, relative to cellobiose. the cazyme with the highest differential expression  contained a single cbm <dig> as its only predicted cazy domain. r. albus  <dig> has  <dig> proteins predicted to contain binding modules with no adjacent catalytic domains, including  <dig> containing a single cbm <dig>   <dig> that each contain  <dig> cbm <dig> domains,  <dig> that contains a cbm <dig> and a cbm <dig> domain,  <dig> that contains  <dig> cbm <dig> domains, and  <dig> containing a cbm <dig> and a cbm <dig> domains. in addition to these orfs, we also investigated whether or not putative pilin-like genes and genes involved in glycocalyx biosynthesis had higher transcription on cellulose, relative to cellobiose, and found that none of these genes were differentially expressed .

in addition to cazymes, orfs found to be expressed more than 4-fold or higher on cellulose, relative to cellobiose, include those predicted to be involved in transcription, and primary metabolism. there were also several clusters of orfs that were differentially expressed including four putative abc transporter operons that each had 4-fold or higher transcription in response to growth on cellulose . most notably, the entire tryptophan biosynthetic operon had over 13-fold higher transcription in response to cellulose, and is discussed in the following section.

tryptophan enrichment among cazymes is widespread among cellulolytic organisms
the tryptophan biosynthetic operon was the most highly expressed set of orfs in the r. albus  <dig> chemostat culture grown on cellulose, as compared to cellobiose . this finding was further verified using reverse transcription quantitative pcr  of the tryptophan biosynthetic gene, rumal_ <dig>  normalized to 16s rrna, which was found to be expressed  <dig>  fold higher on cellulose, relative to cellobiose. despite the highly regulated nature of this pathway, induction of the tryptophan operon in response to growth on cellulose has been previously observed in c. phytofermentans where it was thought to involve an increased need for tryptophan in the cazymes important for growth on cellulose  <cit> . we tested this hypothesis for r. albus  <dig> and found that cazymes in this bacterium also showed a significantly higher percentage of tryptophans compared to all other genes in the genome . an analysis of cazymes from a range of other cellulolytic, amylolytic and hemicellulolytic species also showed a significant enrichment for tryptophan as well as tyrosine , but not for non-aromatic amino acids like methionine . this indicates that a specific enrichment for aromatic amino acids among cazymes is widespread among cellulolytic bacteria, and not specific to r. albus  <dig> or c. phytofermentans.table  <dig>

since cazymes account for only  <dig> % of the proteins predicted to be encoded by the genome sequence of r. albus  <dig>  a small enrichment  of tryptophan in cazymes is unlikely to require a 13-fold increase in transcription of the tryptophan biosynthetic operon. this is supported by our finding that trna transcription and transcription of other aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathways, including tyrosine, were unaffected by growth on cellulose . an alternative hypothesis is that exogenous tryptophan accumulates in r. albus  <dig> when grown on cellulose. we tested this and found that extracellular tryptophan did not accumulate in r. albus  <dig> batch cultures grown on cellulose .

discussion
ruminococci are ubiquitous members of mammalian git microbial communities and play an important role in plant fiber degradation in the bovine rumen. as key members of the rumen ecosystem, ruminococcus spp. are known for their ability to degrade a wide range of plant polysaccharides, including cellulose. here we use both genomic and transcriptomic evidence to show that r. albus  <dig> is distinct from other cellulosome-utilizing ruminococci. adherence to fiber is required for cellulose hydrolysis by r. albus strains and several mechanisms for fiber-digestion have been proposed by others. importantly, four components have been implicated in r. albus fiber adherence including: pilin-like appendages  <cit> , a glycocalyx  <cit> , cellulosomes  <cit> , and the unique carbohydrate binding module cbm <dig>  <cit> . these findings led to the model that a combination of these four components may be involved in fiber attachment in r. albus
 <cit> .

we examined both genomic and transcriptomic evidence for each of the four components implicated in r. albus  <dig> fiber adherence. first, we were able to identify pilin-like genes encoded by a pil/sec locus in the r. albus  <dig> genome sequence with high similarity and identical organization to the loci identified in r. albus  <dig> and r. albus  <dig>  <cit> . however, our transcriptional analysis did not detect changes in this locus in response to growth on cellulose . a molecule required for optimal growth on cellulose, 3-phenylpropanoic acid , was shown by others to increase transcription of the pila <dig>  gene in r. albus  <dig>  <cit> . we did not observe an increase in expression for this orf in r. albus  <dig> but ppa was present under all growth conditions tested in our experiments.

second, r. albus  <dig> forms a glycocalyx when grown on cellulose comprised of proteins, uronic acids and sugars including glucose, xylose, some mannose and other sugars  <cit> . we identified genes in r. albus  <dig> with putative roles in the anabolic sugar pathways for xylose, mannose, and fructose. however, key enzymes in the synthesis of udp-xylose, such as a udp-galactose decarboxylase or a glucose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase were not present in the r. albus  <dig> genome . this is surprising because as much as 20% of the glycocalyx in r. albus  <dig> is composed of xylose  <cit>  and it may indicate that synthesis of udp-xylose is achieved by a different biosynthetic route, or that udp is not involved in xylose synthesis. although glycocalyx biosynthetic genes have not been experimentally identified in r. albus  <dig>  none of the anabolic sugar pathway genes with a predicted role in glycocalyx formation had significantly higher transcription during growth on cellulose and a few of these genes had lower transcription during growth on cellulose . these findings suggest that, at the transcriptional level, glycocalyx synthesis is not induced during growth on cellulose.

third, microscopic evidence for “cellulosome-like protuberances” in some strains of r. albus
 <cit>  along with molecular evidence for cellulosomal components in r. albus f- <dig> and r. albus sy <dig>  <cit>  led to the proposal that at least some r. albus strains produce cellulosomes. however, several endoglucanases and xylanases in r. albus f- <dig> and r. albus sy <dig> lack dockerin domains and fibrolytic activity in r. albus sy <dig> did not associate with high molecular-weight protein complexes. these results suggested that non-cellulosomal glycanases may also be present in these r. albus strains  <cit> . in our analysis, r. albus  <dig> contained few homologs of known cellulosome components, consistent with previous reports  <cit> . scaffoldins, like those found in r. flavefaciens fd- <dig> or c. thermocellum atcc  <dig>  were entirely absent and only one putative cohesin was identified. this cohesin  had an average of  <dig> -fold higher transcription when grown on cellulose compared to cellobiose. moreover, r. albus  <dig> contained fewer dockerins than bacteria with confirmed cellulosomes and most of these belong to the interpro families ipr <dig> or ipr <dig>  which were also abundant in other non-cellulolytic ruminococci like r. bromii l2- <dig> . this finding could imply a physiological role for these dockerins that is distinct from their role in cellulosomes. in support of this hypothesis, a global analysis of dockerins and cohesins identified their widespread presence among non-cellulolytic organisms in all three domains of life  <cit> . these non-cellulosomal dockerins and cohesins are also suspected in cellulolytic organisms that form multi-enzyme cellulolytic complexes. for instance, dockerin domains were identified in the r. flavefaciens fd- <dig> genome in orfs that lacked cazymes but contained leucine-rich repeat, transglutaminase, and serine protease inhibitor modules instead  <cit> .

fourth, in the absence of cellulosomes, r. albus  <dig> and r. albus  <dig> may instead rely on alternate carbohydrate-binding modules, such as cbm37s, to facilitate coordination of secreted carbohydrases. this conclusion is supported by our finding that all of the cazymes with 4-fold or higher transcription on cellulose contained cbm <dig> domains, with the exception of rumal_ <dig>  we identified  <dig> proteins containing one or more cbm <dig> domains that lacked adjacent catalytic domains. we analyzed these proteins and found that nearly half of them also contained leucine-rich repeat domains. leucine-rich repeats have been implicated in protein-protein interaction  <cit> , and it is possible that cbm <dig> functions to coordinate an extracellular complex of carbohydrases. our results also indicated that, in general, genes that had higher transcription during growth on cellulose were distinct from genes encoding pilin structures and glycocalyx components that have been shown by others  <cit>  to be affected by ppa. future work will be needed to define these regulons.

the cellulolytic capacity of r. albus  <dig> has historically been correlated to the production of a number of fermentation products like acetate and ethanol  <cit> . our analysis expands on these findings to further reveal that r. albus  <dig> can utilize more polysaccharides than other ruminal cellulolytic bacteria like f. succinogenes s <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that it may be more of a carbohydrate generalist in the rumen. moreover, we found that r. albus  <dig> hydrolyzed several components of the plant cell wall and produced yields of ethanol and acetate comparable to other ethanologenic cellulolytic organisms. although we observed different ratios of ethanol:acetate in batch versus continuous culture, the ethanol:acetate ratio has been shown to vary with dilution rate in continuous cultures of r. albus  <dig>  <cit> . we found more reducing sugars were produced from homoxylan purified from tobacco stalk than from the more complex larchwood xylan. the difference in reducing sugars likely indicates less fermentation of the larchwood xylan because lower amounts of fermentation products were produced from this substrate. in contrast, we found higher cell yields when r. albus  <dig> was grown on cellulose, relative to cellobiose, and we believe that this observation likely reflects the higher net atp yield from phosphorolytic cleavage of cellodextrins compared to that on cellobiose, as has been previously proposed  <cit> .

in the rumen, r. albus  <dig> encounters plant biomass that includes complexes of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and other polysaccharides. when grown on crystalline cellulose as the sole carbon source, we found that r. albus  <dig> had a broad transcriptional response that included increased transcription of hemicellulases and other carbohydrases for substrates that were not present in the growth medium. importantly, the transcriptional differences that we observed were not confounded by growth rate, a factor that is known to affect differential genes expression in other cellulolytic bacteria  <cit> , as the growth of r. albus  <dig> was controlled using the same dilution rate with each substrate. this may indicate that cellulose initiates a generalized transcriptional response to plant fibers in r. albus  <dig>  or that cellobiose represses such a response, although this hypothesis remains to be tested.

we were surprised to find that the tryptophan biosynthetic operon was highly transcribed when r. albus  <dig> was grown on cellulose, relative to cellobiose in chemostat cultures. although increased transcription of tryptophan biosynthesis is not a typical observation for other cellulolytic organisms  <cit> , a similar response has been noted for c. phytofermentans isdg  <cit> . c. phytofermentans isdg is also an ethanologenic, cellulolytic organism, but is distinguished from r. albus  <dig> by the relative abundance of cohesins, dockerins and cellulases . it is reasonable to propose that increased transcription of the tryptophan operon is due to increased demand for tryptophan in cazymes, however, we found that tryptophan enrichment  in carbohydrate-active enzymes is widespread, even among non-fibrolytic organisms. we did not detect an increase of the tyrosine biosynthetic pathway or any other  amino acid biosynthetic pathway in response to growth on cellulose. based on these findings it is unlikely that the transcriptional increase of the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway could be explained by increased production of cazymes. taken together, these results could suggest a role for tryptophan in a peripheral metabolic activity concomitant with, but distinct from, growth on cellulose. for instance, tryptophan may confer ethanol stress tolerance as has been reported for yeast  <cit> . alternatively, tryptophan or their derivatives could be used as signaling molecules, as tryptophan-derived tryptophols are reported to serve as quorum-sensing molecules under nitrogen-poor conditions in yeast  <cit> . a similar mechanism might be employed by r. albus  <dig> to coordinate fiber adherence, but future work will be needed to determine the exact role of tryptophan in cellulose degradation.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides the first comprehensive transcriptomic analysis for any ruminococcal species, in addition to characterizing the fermentative capabilities of r. albus  <dig> on a wide range of fibrous substrates. analysis of the r. albus  <dig> transcriptome suggests that it initiates a broad transcriptional response to growth on cellulose, including an increase in the tryptophan biosynthetic operon and a range of cbm37-containing coding regions. our data suggest that r. albus  <dig> relies heavily on cbm37-containing proteins to coordinate a fibrolytic response instead of using cellulosomes. we also found little evidence to support a role for pil-like proteins or glycocalyx components in the transcriptional response of r. albus  <dig> grown on cellulose. taken together, our findings reveal unique aspects of fiber degradation by r. albus  <dig> and contribute to a revised model for the cellulolytic strategy employed by this important ruminococcal species.
