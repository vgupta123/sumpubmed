BACKGROUND
iron regulatory proteins, irp <dig> and irp <dig>  post-transcriptionally control the expression of several mrnas bearing iron responsive elements . in iron-deficient cells, ire/irp interactions account for the stabilization of transferrin receptor  <dig>  mrna and the translational inhibition of ferritin  mrnas, resulting in increased uptake and reduced sequestration of iron  <cit> . irps regulate the expression of additional ire-containing transcripts, such as those encoding erythroid aminolevulinate synthase , mitochondrial aconitase, the iron transporter ferroportin  <dig>  myotonic dystrophy kinase-related cdc42-binding kinase α , hypoxia inducible factor  <dig> α , and splice variants of the divalent metal transporter dmt <dig> and the kinase cdc14a  <cit> . experiments with irp1-/- and irp2-/- cells and animals revealed that irp <dig> exerts a dominant regulatory function in vivo  <cit> .

both irp <dig> and irp <dig> share significant sequence similarity  <cit> . a major difference in their primary structure is that irp <dig> contains a unique insertion of  <dig> amino acids close to its n-terminus . in iron-replete cells, irp <dig> binds a cubane 4fe-4s cluster, which precludes ire-binding, renders the protein to a cytosolic aconitase and maintains it in a closed conformation  <cit> . under these conditions, irp <dig> undergoes rapid ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome  <cit> . phosphorylation or defects in fe-s cluster assembly may also sensitize irp <dig> to iron-dependent proteasomal degradation, albeit with slower kinetics compared to irp <dig>  <cit> .

the mechanism for irp <dig> degradation is far from being understood. it has been proposed that the 73d functions as an "iron-dependent degradation domain". one model postulates that the iron-sensing capacity of the 73d is based on site-specific oxidation of conserved cysteine residues upon direct iron binding  <cit> . another model suggests that irp <dig> degradation is triggered by oxidative modification following high affinity binding of heme within the 73d  <cit> . nevertheless, experiments in cultured cells showed that irp <dig> deletion mutants lacking the entire 73d remain as sensitive to iron as wild type irp <dig>  <cit> . moreover, the 73d failed to destabilize gfp fusion indicator constructs in iron-loaded cells  <cit> , casting further doubt on its proposed function as a necessary and sufficient regulatory element for irp <dig> degradation. recent results showed that 73d is sensitive to proteolytic cleavage and that heme binding only occurs in its truncated form  <cit> .

irp <dig> is stabilized in response to hypoxia  <cit> , by analogy to hif α subunits that play a crucial role in cellular adaptation to low oxygen levels  <cit> . under normoxic conditions, hif α subunits undergo post-translational modification by the prolyl-hydroxylases phd1– <dig>  which tag them for ubiquitination by the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase vhl and degradation by the proteasome  <cit> . these enzymes, as well as other 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, catalyze the hydroxylation of protein substrates by using 2-oxoglutarate. the reaction yields a hydroxylated amino acid, succinate and carbon dioxide, and proceeds via an iron-oxo intermediate  <cit> . the availability of ferrous iron, oxygen and ascorbate  is critical for catalysis.

experimental evidence supports a mechanism for irp <dig> degradation via 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. thus, dimethyl-oxalyl-glycine , a substrate analogue of 2-oxoglutarate, protected irp <dig> against iron-dependent degradation  <cit> . furthermore, ascorbate and other antioxidants accelerated the degradation of irp <dig>  <cit> . nevertheless, the protective effect of dmog was restricted to cells that were previously depleted from iron by the chelator desferrioxamine, indicating that the iron-dependent degradation of irp <dig> is mediated by multiple mechanisms. one of them appears to interfere with the heme biosynthetic pathway, as succinyl-acetone, an inhibitor of endogenous heme synthesis, stabilized irp <dig> against iron  <cit> ; this result has independently been reproduced in various laboratories  <cit> . the e <dig> ubiquitin ligases vhl  <cit>  and hoil- <dig>  <cit>  are not required for irp <dig> degradation in response to iron.

to identify structural elements within irp <dig> that may play a role in iron sensing and in the regulation of its stability, we undertook a systematic deletion analysis. our data suggest that c-terminal sequences are necessary for the iron-dependent degradation of irp <dig>  however, these sequences only operate in a context of irp structure and do not have intrinsic iron sensing properties.

RESULTS
the c-terminal domain of irp <dig> is necessary for its iron-dependent degradation
even though the crystal structure of irp <dig> has not yet been solved, on the basis of irp <dig> structural data  <cit>  and sequence homology between irp <dig> and irp <dig>  it can be predicted that the irp <dig> molecule is composed of three compact domains  linked to a fourth domain via a hinge region . having established that the irp2-specific 73d is dispensable for iron-dependent degradation, at least in the context of full-length irp <dig> and gfp-fusion indicator constructs  <cit> , we reasoned that other sequences within irp <dig> might possess iron-sensing properties. to address this, we generated a series of irp <dig> c-terminal deletion mutants, truncated at domains 2– <dig> , 3– <dig> , or  <dig> , and an n-terminal deletion mutant, truncated at domain  <dig> . we also generated variants of Δd <dig>  and Δd <dig> irp <dig> lacking the 73d region , to reevaluate a possible regulatory function of this sequence in the deletion mutants. all mutants  were transfected into h <dig> cells for tetracycline-inducible expression. several clones of irp <dig> c-terminal deletion mutants were isolated; however, no stable clone expressing Δd <dig> irp <dig> could be obtained. the cells were subjected to treatments with hemin or ferric ammonium citrate  to analyze the response of the irp <dig> deletion mutants to iron. we employed clones with variable expression levels to avoid possible confounding effects due to saturation of the irp <dig> degradation machinery  <cit> . notably, in contrast to wild type irp <dig> , iron loading did not affect the expression of any of the truncated irp <dig> variants , even though these treatments are known to promote the degradation of wild type irp <dig>  <cit> . these data provide further evidence that the 73d is not crucial for irp <dig> degradation. as the minimal truncation of the c-terminal domain  <dig> appears sufficient for stabilization of the remaining irp <dig> polypeptide, these data also suggest that this region may have a functional role in iron sensing.

the c-terminal domain  <dig> of irp <dig> sensitizes irp11–3-irp <dig> chimeras for iron-dependent degradation
to further evaluate the iron sensing capacity of the irp <dig> c-terminus, we generated irp1/irp <dig> chimeras by swapping domains  <dig> between irp <dig> and irp <dig> . the resulting irp21–3-irp <dig> and irp11–3-irp <dig> constructs were transfected into h <dig> cells and at least three clones with variable expression levels were isolated and analyzed for sensitivity to iron. while, as expected, the expression of wild type irp <dig> was diminished following treatment with fac , the replacement of its domain  <dig> with that of irp <dig> rendered the irp21–3-irp <dig> chimera resistant to iron . furthermore, domain  <dig> of irp <dig> sufficed to decrease the expression of the irp11–3-irp <dig> chimera in iron-loaded cells . under these conditions, wild type irp <dig>  as well as a Δd <dig> irp <dig> deletion mutant , remained unresponsive to iron treatments .

the half-lives  of the chimeric proteins were then directly determined by pulse-chase experiments in the absence or presence of fac and compared to those of wild type irp <dig> and irp <dig> . wild type irp <dig> did not decay over  <dig> h in control or iron-loaded cells , consistently with earlier observations  <cit>  and references therein]. by contrast, the fac treatment dramatically reduced the t1/ <dig> of wild type irp <dig> from ~ <dig> to < <dig> h , again consistently with previous data  <cit>  and references therein]. the presence of irp <dig> domain  <dig> destabilized the irp11–3-irp <dig> chimera compared to wild type irp <dig> and, moreover, sensitized it to iron. thus, the fac treatment further reduced its t1/ <dig> from ~ <dig> to ~ <dig>  h ; this effect was statistically significant . on the other hand, domain  <dig> of irp <dig> abolished the responsiveness of the irp21–3-irp <dig> chimera to iron and apparently accelerated its decay  compared to wild type irp <dig> , possibly by dramatically altering its overall structure. taken together, these results substantiate the necessity of irp <dig> domain  <dig> in iron sensing and in the targeting of the protein for degradation.

the swapping of domains  <dig> between irp <dig> and irp <dig> impinges on the ire-binding properties of the chimeras
considering that the binding of rna profoundly alters the conformation of irp <dig>  <cit>  and this could potentially affect protein stability, we analyzed the ire-binding properties of the chimeras by emsa. the removal of tetracycline from cells expressing irp11–3-irp <dig> induced ire/irp complex formation , indicating that this chimerical protein retains ire-binding activity. this was verified by supershifting ire/irp11–3-irp <dig> complexes with the ha antibody . the functional implications of this interaction are illustrated in the increased tfr <dig> levels in cells expressing irp11–3-irp <dig> . interestingly, the replacement of irp <dig> domain  <dig> with that of irp <dig> abrogated the ire-binding capacity of the protein; thus, the irp21–3-irp <dig> chimera was inactive in the binding assay and only ire complexes with wild type irp <dig> could be supershifted with the ha antibody . this is in agreement with the possibility that this chimera may possess a distorted structure. as expected, irp21–3-irp <dig> failed to stimulate the expression of tfr <dig> .

truncation of the c-terminal domain  <dig> of irp <dig> to identify minimal iron-sensing sequences
the above data are consistent with an involvement of irp <dig> domain  <dig> in tagging the protein for proteasomal degradation. to identify minimal requirements for this activity, further deletion mutants within domain  <dig> were generated, expressed in h <dig> cells and analyzed for their response to iron . we first noticed that the Δc <dig>  but also the Δc <dig> deletion mutants remained stable in iron-loaded cells , indicating that the sequence encompassing the  <dig> c-terminal amino acids of irp <dig> may possess iron-sensing properties. to further address this, we generated irp <dig> variants lacking either the  <dig> c-terminal  or the adjacent  <dig> amino acids . both the Δc <dig>  as well as the Δc <dig> deletion mutants were resistant to iron-mediated degradation .

even though the peptides encompassing the  <dig> c-terminal amino acids of irp <dig> and irp <dig> are largely conserved , they display notable differences and cluster separately in a phylogenetic dendrogram . for example, the irp <dig> c-terminus is serine-rich, whereas serines are completely absent from the respective segment of mammalian irp1s. we considered irp2-specific amino acids in this region as potential regulatory sites and hypothesized that their replacement with irp1-specific counterparts might confer an irp1-like phenotype . thus, we focused on non-conserved amino acids that differ significantly  between irp <dig> and irp <dig> and generated irp <dig> variants with s929d, s939r and l948y irp1-like point mutations. however, none of these manipulations resulted in stabilization of the irp <dig> mutants against iron .

a bona fide iron sensor would be expected to function not only within irp <dig>  but also in the context of an unrelated protein. to examine this, the region encompassing the c-terminal  <dig> or  <dig> amino acids of irp <dig> was fused to luciferase indicator constructs  and expressed in h <dig> cells. however, none of the fusion proteins exhibited any susceptibility to iron loading, and remained stable following treatment of the cells with fac . in control experiments, we observed that the expression of an unmodified luciferase indicator did not respond to iron . thus, while the c-terminal irp <dig> sequences are required for irp <dig> degradation, they fail to destabilize the luciferase indicator in response to iron.

discussion
the sensitivity of irp <dig> to iron has been known for years  <cit> . nevertheless, the mechanism for its iron-dependent degradation remains unresolved and, moreover, little progress has been made towards identifying and characterizing irp <dig> sequences with iron-sensing properties. the irp2-specific 73d has been proposed to function as an iron sensor either via direct binding of iron to c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  <cit> , or binding of heme to c <dig>  <cit>  or c <dig>  <cit> . nevertheless, several labs have demonstrated that the above cysteine residues and the entire 73d are dispensable for irp <dig> degradation in cultured cells  <cit> , even though published data with opposing views exist  <cit> . we reasoned that an unbiased systematic deletion analysis of irp <dig> might shed light onto this issue and facilitate the identification of segments of the protein with iron-sensing capacity in vivo. to this end, we generated several irp <dig> deletion mutants and transfected them into h <dig> cells for tetracycline-inducible expression. to avoid saturation effects related to overexpression  <cit> , we selected and analyzed multiple clones with variable irp <dig> expression levels for their response to iron treatment. we were unable to isolate stable clones expressing the n-terminal deletion mutant Δd1; the reason for this is unclear.

the truncation of irp <dig> at its c-terminus was sufficient for the stabilization of the protein in iron-loaded cells, independently of the presence or absence of 73d . these findings not only confirmed that 73d fails to function as an iron sensor in vivo, but also shifted our focus for the identification of iron-sensing sequences to the c-terminal domain  <dig> of irp <dig>  further support for the significance of this region in the control of irp <dig> stability was provided by experiments with irp1/irp <dig> chimeras, generated by swapping the domains  <dig> between these proteins . thus, domain  <dig> of irp <dig> accelerated the decay of the irp11-3-irp <dig> chimera in iron-loaded cells . the stability of Δd <dig> irp <dig> against iron  denotes that this effect is not due to merely the loss of the irp <dig> c-terminal region. along these lines, domain  <dig> of irp <dig> abolished the iron responsiveness of the irp21–3-irp <dig> chimera . collectively, these data suggest that the c-terminus of irp <dig> is necessary for its iron-dependent degradation. it should, however, be noticed that the response of the irp11–3-irp <dig> chimera to iron was modest, compared to wild type irp <dig> , indicating the involvement of additional irp <dig> sequences, outside domain  <dig>  in controlling the rate of its degradation.

the iron-sensitive irp11–3-irp <dig> chimera retained rna-binding activity  and was functional in regulating downstream ire-containing mrna targets, as shown by the increase in tfr <dig> expression . by contrast, the apparently labile irp21–3-irp <dig> chimera was resistant to iron and failed to bind rna , raising the possibility that the iron responsiveness may be linked to the rna-binding capacity. we did not directly address this issue; nevertheless, the recent description of other iron-sensitive irp1/irp <dig> chimeras that are inactive in rna-binding suggests that this is not the case  <cit> . considering that the 4fe-4s cluster is necessary to maintain irp <dig> in a compact structure  <cit>  and a failure to assemble it sensitizes the protein for slow iron-dependent degradation  <cit> , it will be of interest to examine whether the chimerical proteins retain a capacity to assemble a 4fe-4s cluster, and whether this correlates with their responsiveness to iron.

in an attempt to narrow down the putative iron-sensing region of irp <dig>  we further truncated domain  <dig> of the protein and established that the deletion of just small c-terminal segments abolished iron-dependent degradation of irp <dig> . however, the fusion of  <dig> or  <dig> c-terminal amino acids of irp <dig> to luciferase failed to promote the degradation of this chimerical protein in iron-loaded cells .

conceivably, the observed stabilization of the irp <dig> deletion mutants is related to a disruption of the overall irp <dig> structure that may prevent the exposure of iron-sensing regions. alternatively, the c-terminal domain of irp <dig> may contribute to an iron-dependent rearrangement of the protein structure, which would render it more sensitive to proteolysis. in this scenario, the actual iron sensor could be another factor, such as a proteolytic enzyme, that may attack the destabilized protein upon activation by iron.

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that sequences within the c-terminus of irp <dig> are necessary, but not sufficient for iron-dependent degradation, at least outside an irp context. thus, the c-terminus of irp <dig> does not possess the properties of a bona fide iron sensor but its regulatory function requires irp structural integrity and very likely additional elements within other domains of irp <dig> and/or other factors.
