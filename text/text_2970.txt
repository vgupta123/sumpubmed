BACKGROUND
in plants, growth development, cell patterning, yield, and biomass accumulation are controlled by functional genetic networks of several orders of magnitude that will require various complementary research approaches to uncover the basis of this functional genetic complexity. using a combination of reverse genetic and computational protein modeling, we identified a protein, termed gigantus <dig> , a member of transducin/wd <dig> protein superfamily that regulates growth development in plants.

transducin/wd <dig> repeat proteins are prominent features within proteins that mediate diverse protein-protein interactions, including those involved in scaffolding and the cooperative assembly and regulation of dynamic multi-subunit complexes  <cit> . the common and defined feature of these proteins are short ~ <dig> amino acid motifs, typically ending by trp-asp sequence, and usually composed of a 7- <dig> bladed beta-propeller fold. however, a diversity of proteins has been found with  <dig> to  <dig> repeated units  <cit> . the low level of sequence conservation and functional diversity of wd <dig> domains make their identification difficult.

repeated wd <dig> domains play central roles in biological processes such as cell division and cytokinesis, apoptosis, light signaling and vision, cell motility, flowering, floral development, meristem organization, protein trafficking, cytoskeleton dynamics, chemotaxis, nuclear export to rna processing, chromatin modification, and transcriptional mechanism  <cit> . they act as a site for protein-protein interaction, where the specificity of the proteins is determined by the sequences outside the repeats themselves. their functional importance resides largely on the protein surfaces. they serve as multi-interacting platforms in cellular networks for the assembly of protein complexes or mediators of transient interplay among other proteins  <cit> . structural studies suggest that this property stems from their ability to interact with diverse proteins, peptides or nucleic acids using multiple surfaces, where the most common peptide interaction site of wd <dig> proteins is located on the top surface of the propeller close to the central channel  <cit> .

although wd <dig> proteins also are present in bacteria, e.g. thermomonospora curvata <cit>  and cyanobacterium synechocystis <cit> , wd <dig> domains are among the ten most abundant domain types across eukaryotic proteomes, and interactome studies suggest that they are among the most promiscuous interactors. despite several wd40-containing proteins acting as key regulators of plant-specific developmental events, wd <dig> domains have been given less research attention compared to other common domains, for example kinase domains. up to now, there have been no comprehensive 3d structural analyses of wd <dig> protein revealing the interacting partners and highlighting the relevance of wd <dig> domains mediating different biological functions  <cit> . furthermore, in contrast to other members of the β-propeller family, and despite being crucial for and residing in enzymatic complexes, no wd <dig> protein has been reported to possess catalytic activity.

in order to fully understand the molecular- and structural-based regulatory mechanisms of gts <dig> and the transducin/wd <dig> protein family, we carried out a comprehensive expression profiling, a mutational-based phenotypic characterization and a structural-based protein modeling of functional features of gigantus <dig> in arabidopsis. this is the first study in which the interacting partners of arabidosis gts <dig> protein have been identified. a comprehensive molecular and structural analysis based on protein homology modeling, and a docking interaction study to elucidate the functional mechanisms of gts <dig> protein in regulating growth development in arabidopsis thaliana were carried out. we described the phenotypic characterization of a gts <dig> knockout mutant during growth development and assessed the gts1-3d molecular structure and its docking features to uncover the regulatory relationship of gts <dig> with other proteins.

methods
plant material and gts <dig> expression profiling analysis
arabidopsis thaliana  and gts <dig> knockout mutant  from arabidopsis biological research center  were used throughout this work. appropriate seeds were sown on murashige and skoog  agar plates or soil and seedlings were allowed to grow under continuous illumination  at 24°c. seedling samples were collected at different developmental stages for gene expression profiling. to analyze the expression of gts <dig> gene, total rna was extracted with trizol reagent  and then reversed transcribed using qscript cdna supermix  as previously described  <cit> . thereafter, the cdna was used as the template for pcr using gene-specific primers , running  <dig> or  <dig> amplification cycles  unless otherwise noted  <cit> . the linear range of amplification was determined by running increasing cycle numbers and analyzing the amount of cdna fragments. pcr fragments were separated on 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. a cdna fragment generated from actin  served as an internal control. t-dna insertion in gigantus <dig> gene was pcr-confirmed using gigantus <dig> gene specific primers and t-dna left border  primer . the expression of gts <dig> gene in gts <dig> mutant background was analyzed by extracting total rna from the gts <dig> homozygous line as above described and reverse transcribed into cdna as previously described  <cit> , and further used in expression analysis.

gts <dig> database search and phylogenetic analysis
the arabidopsis thaliana gts <dig> cdna sequence  was obtained from the arabidopsis-tair website and used to perform a nucleotide blast  search of the oryza sativa  genomic sequence on the salk institute ricege <dig> web interface. the rice sequence identified as having the highest degree of homology to the arabidopsis cdna was downloaded and translated. the translated rice sequence was then aligned to the arabidopsis protein sequence to validate the identification of the gene. the rice cdna sequences were then used to perform a  search against the sequenced zea mays genome on the maizesequence.org website. blast searches against the maize genome produced a list of bac sequences that aligned to the query sequence. the bac with the highest level of similarity was indicated on a genome map. the complete bac sequence was downloaded and aligned to the oryza sativa cdna sequence using the ncbi blast  algorithm. once the putative exons had been identified for a specific gene homolog, the exon start and end positions were manually corrected based on the canonical splice site donor/acceptor sequences and the overlapping sequence from one putative exon to the next. each putative maize cdna was then translated into a protein sequence. the gts <dig> protein sequences from both oryza sativa and zea mays were aligned to the arabidopsis thaliana sequence using the emboss global pairwise alignment algorithm  <cit>  to get the percent identity between the proteins. next a blastp search of the homo sapiens proteome in the ncbi database was performed using the arabidopsis thaliana gts <dig> protein sequence. from this search the wdr <dig> sequence of homo sapiens was identified as the most homologous protein. the wdr <dig> sequence was used to retrieve  the rattus norvegicus and the mus musculis sequence homologs. finally, a clustalw <dig> alignment  <cit>  was performed aligning all of the gts <dig> protein sequences from arabidopsis thaliana, oryza sativa, and zea mays with the wdr <dig> protein sequences from homo sapiens, rattus norvegicus, and mus musculis.

the conserved wd <dig> protein sequence from arabidopsis thaliana was identified using scanprosite and the swiss-prot/tremble databases. the identified wd <dig> sequence was used to perform a blastp search against plant proteomes on ncbi. from the list of potential wd <dig> containing proteins, the cdna sequence of several gts1-like proteins were downloaded from nicotiana benthamiana, nicotiana tabacum, pisum sativum, phaseolus vulgaris, medicago truncatula, gossypium hirsutum, lycopersicon esculentum, solanum chacoense, solanum lycopersicum, and physcomitrella patens. the collected plant wd <dig> containing cdna sequences were combined with the arabidopsis thaliana, oryza sativa, and zea mays cdna sequences previously obtained and aligned using revtrans version  <dig>   <cit> . using mraic  <cit>  model test software the best aic model to use in constructing phylogenetic relationships was determined to be the general transition rate  with gamma.

phylogenetic trees were generated in mrbayes using four markov chain monte carlo runs with three cold and one hot chain each for  <dig> , <dig> generations sampling every  <dig> generations. the burnin was determined to be within the first  <dig> generations for each phylogeny. the first  <dig> generations sampled were removed and a 50% consensus majority tree was constructed from the remaining trees. trees were then drawn using treeview version  <dig> . <dig> and rooted using the physcomitrella patens sequence as an out group.

sequences interaction database search
arabidopsis thaliana gts <dig>  a transducin/wd <dig> repeat protein  was used as query to retrieve wd <dig> protein sequences from uniprot , and ncbi  databases using blast tools .

gts <dig> protein interaction network was obtained using the string v <dig>   database. string outcome gave the two most possible interacting protein counterparts for gts <dig> protein, a 60s ribosome structural protein l19e , and nop <dig> , a protein involved in 60s subunit ribosomal biogenesis.

functional domains analyses
gts <dig> protein functional domains were studied by querying different structure-functional motifs and/or patterns databases such as pfam v <dig>  , prosite , smart v <dig>  , conserved domain database  v <dig> , cdart  and cd-search tools , interpro v <dig>  , prodom release  <dig>  , cath v <dig>  , superfamily v <dig>  , pirsf , and functional searched by panther . similar analysis was performed for both interacting ribosomal protein counterparts, nop <dig> and l19e.

secondary structure prediction
secondary structural elements of the gts <dig> protein were initially assessed for substructure conserved motifs by threading the sequences through the protein data bank   library using threading algorithm the segmer  <cit> . these elements of the secondary structure were also confirmed by comparison with the results obtained with other additional 2-d structure servers: sspro <dig> , netsurfp ver.  <dig>  , and psipred  fold servers. these secondary structure predictions were also performed for both interacting ribosomal protein counterparts, nop <dig> and l19e.

structural templates searching
protein sequences of gts <dig>  nop <dig> and l19e were searched for homology in the protein data bank . homologous templates suitable for these three proteins were selected by blastp from the blast server . the bioinfobank metaserver , which employs fold recognition for homology search, was also used for the selection of templates. the results obtained by previous methods were compared with the results obtained by swiss-model server for template identification .

homology modeling
homology modeling was performed by the i-tasser server  <cit> . an initial structural model was generated and checked for recognition of errors in 3d structures using prosa , and for a first overall quality estimation of the model with qmean .

energy minimization of the final structures was performed using gromos <dig> force field energy implemented in deepview/swiss-pdbviewer v <dig>   in order to improve the van der waals contacts and correct the stereochemistry of the model.

each structure was assessed using the following softwares: qmean for quality, procheck  for stereological corrections, prosa, and anolea  for protein energy. the number of protein residues in the favored regions for each structure were calculated and visualized by the ramachandran plot.

ligand-binding domains and conservational analysis
ligand-binding sites in the 3d protein structures were analyzed using cofactor software , to identify functional homology. gene ontology  terms  were used to identify functional analogs based on the 3d built models, indicating the possible functions and biological pathway in which the proteins might be involved .

conservational analyses of the proteins were made by generating evolutionary related conservation scores using consurf server . structural function conservation and key residues in the query proteins were identified by conseq server .

surface electrostatic potential analysis
the electrostatic poisson-boltzmann  potentials for the surface amino acids of the structures were obtained using apbs software implemented in pymol  <dig>   with amber <dig>  and optimized with the python software package pdb2pqr. fine grid spaces of  <dig>  Å were used to solve the linearized pb equation in sequential focusing multigrid calculations in a mesh of  <dig> points per dimension at  <dig>  k. the dielectric constants were two for the proteins and  <dig>  for water. the output mesh was processed in the scalar opendx format to render the isocontours and maps on the surfaces with pymol  <dig> . potential values are given in units of kt per unit charge .

molecuolar docking analysis
the analysis of interactions between gts <dig> with each of its ribosomal counterparts  was performed using cluspro server  <cit> . during the workflow, backbone flexibility analysis was done using rigid-body ensemble docking with multiple structures derived from nmr, while the zdock option for sampling at 6-degree rotational steps was used to obtain the decoys. the energies of docked conformations from protein-protein docking were evaluated by applying the fast fourier transform  correlation approach.docking scores were calculated by considering shape complementarity, desolvation, and electrostatics potential. the top docked conformations, along with their zdock scores, were used as candidates of near-native structures, and for clustering of binding sites where the ligand was within 10 Å of its receptor.

after clustering, the ranked complexes were subjected to van der waals minimization using charmm, and the protein-inhibitor structure with the best score was chosen as the most fitting model for gts1-ribosomal interacting proteins.

RESULTS
molecular and structural analysis of gts1
expression profiling and phylogenetic analysis of gts1
the arabidopsis gts <dig> is highly expressed during seed germination and particularly accumulating in embryo, ovule, and endosperm, . it is abundantly expressed in meristemic regions, indicating its crucial role in regulating cell divisions . the strong tissue  specific expression pattern of gts <dig>  suggests its regulatory implication in plant growth developmental process .

we confirmed that gts <dig> transcript accumulates in several major organs, including developing flowers, germinated seeds, young rosette leaves . microarray data analysis at different developmental stages also reveals an overlapping expression pattern of cell division/growth induced genes with gts <dig>  as highlighted in table  <dig> <cit> . these genes are involved in transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes, and various biochemical pathways . on the basis of the high level of amino acid identity between arabidopsis gts <dig> and other well characterized wd <dig> protein homologs , a phylogenetic analysis showed that arabidopsis gts <dig> is clustered with the rice and maize gts <dig> , thus indicating that they are more similar to one another than they are to other gts1-wd <dig> repeat sequences . this cluster belongs to a subclade of the dominant clade  containing most of the plant gts <dig> protein homologs.

gts <dig> regulates seed germination and plant growth development
in order to examine the role of gts <dig> in plant growth development, we employed a reverse genetic approach using a salk_tdna knockout insertion  of gts <dig> gene  to investigate the effect of loss of gts <dig> function in gts <dig> mutant. the salk_ <dig>  line harbored a t-dna insertion in the first exon of gts <dig> gene , which was pcr-confirmed by using the t-dna-specific oligonucleotide primer lb <dig> and the gts1-specific primers . we next examined and confirmed the knockout gts <dig> mrna transcript levels in gts <dig> compared to wt using rt-pcr . when compared to the wild type, the homozygous gts <dig> mutant  displayed a faster germination rate , and a faster growth rate and higher biomass accumulation than the wild type  , indicating that gts <dig> negatively regulates cell division, growth and overall biomass accumulation in meristemic regions. furthermore, gts <dig> mutant  flowers earlier  than the wt  , as demonstrated by a reduced number of rosette leaves  compared to the wild type  at bolting time . the mutant  grows significantly taller than wt at the same day post germination .

in order to confirm that gts <dig> is indeed responsible for these phenotypes, we performed a complementation test by rt-pcr amplifying a 1095 bp of gts1-encoding sequence from wt cdna , cloned it into the smai site of the prok <dig> vector  <cit>  in front of camv 35s promoter-driven overexpression  <cit>  and stably transformed gts <dig> mutant background by the floral dip method  <cit> . as expected, the overexpression of gts <dig> in gts <dig> mutant background was sufficient to abolishes the above described gts <dig> phenotypes. the complemented line displayed a wt-like phenotype, indicating that this gts <dig> is indeed responsible for the phenotypic characterization in gts <dig> mutant. unlike the other co-expression gene patterns , we interestingly identified a strong gene-to-gene functional relationship between gts <dig>  and the ribosomal protein l19e  . this data shows the detail of stability of co-expression between the  <dig> genes. the co-expression was supported by many factors, where the pca correlation remained unchanged regardless of the growth parameter/factor considered. both axes are relative gene expression values in base- <dig> logarithm against the averaged expression levels of each gene . these data argue for a strong gene-to-gene functional gene expression, suggesting that these two genes/proteins may physically interact to regulate/control biological processes in plants.

searching for structural templates
since we confirmed that gts <dig> regulates seed germination and growth development  in plants , we next examined the protein structure scaffold and interacting partners of gts <dig> in accomplishing its functions. in order to study the physical interactions of gts <dig> with other proteins in regulating growth development in plants, we performed a protein data bank  search for gts <dig> protein with known tertiary structure in pdb. the search yielded the crystal structures/pdb accession numbers 2h9l, 3iz <dig>  3ow <dig>  2gnq, and 1tbg, showing the highest sequence identity . the suitability of selected model was checked by bioinfobank metaserver, which returned 3d jury scores  of  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>   for gts <dig>  respectively. in order to confirm the best possible templates to use for building the gts <dig> structure, swiss-model server was used, finding high scores  and very low e-values  for the templates 2h9l, , 3ow <dig>  2gnq, and 1tbg respectively.

the same workflow was followed to obtain the best crystal templates in order 3d-structural protein model for the gts <dig> ribosomal interacting partners. the search in the protein data bank  for the protein l19e and nop <dig> yielded the crystal structures of 3iz <dig>  3jyw, and 3u5e for l19e, and 2aje, 1w0t, 2juh, 2ckx, and 2roh for nop <dig>  showing comparable values in identity and suitability by bioinformank metaserver and swiss-model server analysis.

quality of threading models
to assess the quality of the protein models i-tasser and procheck analysis were performed. the i-tasser analysis gave the accuracy parameters such as a c-score of - <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  tm-score with  <dig> decoys and  <dig>  of cluster density for gts <dig>  while procheck analysis revealed that the main chain conformations of gts <dig> protein model were located in the acceptable regions of the ramachandran plot. a majority of residues  were in the most favorable regions, whereas  <dig> % of the residues were placed in the allowed regions, and  <dig> % were in generously allowed regions. only  <dig> % of the residues were present in the disallowed regions, respectively. the plot of × <dig> versus × <dig> torsion angles for each residue showed that most of the rotamers in gts <dig> model was localized in low energy regions. iii) the prosa analysis gave z-scores of - <dig>  for gts <dig>  the scores were within the range usually found for native proteins of similar size, i.e., - <dig> , - <dig> , - <dig> , - <dig> , and - <dig>  for the templates 2h9l, 3iz <dig>  3ow <dig>  2gnq, and 1tbg crystal structures, respectively. iv) qmean analysis of gts <dig> model revealed q-values of  <dig> . a quality factor of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  was estimated for the crystal structures of the templates 2h9l, 3iz <dig>  3ow <dig>  2gnq, and 1tbg, respectively, indicating that the gts <dig> model is within the range of accuracy of the templates crystallographic structures. v) root mean square deviation  between gts <dig> model and the crystal templates cα backbones of the closed templates were  <dig>  Å for 2gnq and  <dig>  Å for 2h9l.

all of the above parameters were also determined for l19e and nop <dig> protein models resulting in comparable structural quality values of our modeled l19e and nop <dig> proteins.

3d structure of arabidopsis gts1
we obtained the best structural models of this newly described arabidopsis wd <dig> repeat protein, gts <dig>  based on homology modeling . the 3d structure of arabidopsis gts <dig> belongs to the transducin/wd <dig> repeat protein family because it shares all the structural characteristics of wd <dig> proteins , which agree with the general crystal structure of 2h9l or 2gnq template. in general, the structure can be visualized as a short, open cylinder where the strands form the walls. at least four repeats are required to form a β-propeller. in our case, gts <dig> contains  <dig> wds, where the final and last  wds participate in the same β-propeller , potentially reinforcing the structure. despite the low amino acid sequence identity across species, a relatively good conservation of the overall fold  of this protein is found among plant species and eukaryotes in general  <cit> .

surface electrostatic potential analysis  reveals several prominent positively charged residues , predominantly in the walls of the cylinder  and c-terminal arm. the environment of this protein is essentially negatively charged  , as highlighted by the poisson - boltzmann electrostatic potential. by assigning a value of + <dig> to basic residues  and - <dig> to the acidic residues , net charge of protein was calculated to be - <dig> for gts <dig>  the central tunnel of the gts <dig> structure exhibited a predominantly positive charge in the top view. comparison between gts <dig> and other wd <dig> repeat proteins, such as templates 2gnq and 2h9l did not exhibited large differences in the general topology as it was further confirmed by the rmsd value of  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å, respectively, whereas significant differences were found in particular regions of the proteins such as the n-terminal, and c-terminal regions.

conservational and functional/ligand-binding site analysis
the conservational and ligand-binding or functional features of gts <dig> were analyzed . surfaces of arabidopsis gts <dig>  showing the conservation index of residues are depicted in figure 6a. consurf conservation analysis showed that gts <dig> cylinder-like β-propeller structure is quite well conserved, especially the residues located in the core of the structure . the n- and c-terminals of the protein are other most conserved regions of the protein, besides the core area which has a major role in maintenance of the protein structure  <cit> . this distribution of the core conserved region and surface variable residues helps maintain a similar overall fold among wd <dig> repeat proteins, but also produces differences observed in terms of a multiple protein interactions along wd <dig> repeat protein, where it is indicated by a discontinued red line for both ribosomal proteins in the gts <dig> structure .

figure 2b shows a general view of the amino acids in the tunnel-like structure holding up the interacting peptides. gts <dig> exhibit the putative active  site located in the center of the structure , which normally is another interacting polypeptide, containing several conserved but also few variable amino acids. a detailed view, showing the spatial distribution of residues responsible for the conformation of the ligand binding domain surrounding the ligand and directly implicated in this interaction are y <dig>  v <dig>  f <dig>  s <dig>  n <dig>  s <dig>  f <dig>  v <dig>  s <dig>  r <dig>  and the peptide chain substrate bound to the tunnel-like structure . conservational analysis of wd <dig> repeat proteins with significant close identity to arabidopsis gts <dig> among other species returned a large number of highly variable  and small number of conserved  residues as written above. conformational predictions indicate that the peptide  is projected to and partially located inside the tunnel-like structure of gts <dig> 

the conservational and functional analysis of the ribosomal l19e and nop <dig> proteins are depicted in the figure  <dig>  consurf conservation analysis in the figure 6a showed that nop <dig> protein is well conserved, especially in the interacting surface region  and the nucleic acids . only few light and deep blue residues are around the surface of the protein. ligand-binding analysis of this protein showed in figure 7b highlights the area of the nop <dig> protein where the interaction with nucleic acids takes place. this area is located in a cleft integrated by the n-terminal α-helix. the residues implicated in the interaction between the protein and the nucleic acid are l <dig>  m <dig>  t <dig>  and r <dig>  resulting in four not well conserved amino acids .

consurf conservation analysis showed in the figure 7c highlights an equally distributed number of conserved and variable residues along the surface of l19e protein. the area of interaction with gts <dig> seems not to be as well conserved as its counterpart nop <dig>  few variable residues  are located in the area of interaction with the n-terminal tail of gts <dig> . in addition, among the surface directly implicated in the interaction with the ribonucleic acid , s <dig>  k <dig>  i <dig>  r <dig>  l <dig>  n <dig> seems to be well conserved, since only one residue, i <dig>  was found to be variable , and the rest exhibit an average index of conservation or highly conserved like r <dig> .

gts <dig> interaction mechanism: molecular docking analysis with ribosomal counterparts
in order to get insights into the gts <dig> regulatory/multi-interacting mode with other proteins, we analyzed the conformational interaction between gts <dig> and two interacting partners involved in the structure and biogenesis of ribosomes in arabidopsis. this analysis was carried out by molecular docking, using newly modeled structures of the two ribosomal proteins.

figure  <dig> shows the mode of interaction between arabidopsis gts <dig> and the nucleolar protein  <dig> , involved in the biogenesis of 60s ribosomal subunit. the binding mechanism occurs through the formation of a stoichiometry complex 1: <dig> between both proteins. a detailed view of this interaction is depicted in the magnified views displayed in figure 8a, where c-terminal arm of gts <dig> is located inside the cavity made by n-terminal α-helix of nop <dig> and neighboring helices, in addition to the direct interaction of this n-t α-helix with the β-propeller  <dig> structure of gts <dig>  the n-t α-helix of gts <dig> is covered completely by the nop <dig> cleft, therefore preventing access by other interacting partners to this area. on the other hand, it also partially impedes the interactions that are necessary for binding the nucleic acid to nop <dig> by stereological impediment. the interaction is non-covalent, thus it may be reversible by increasing salt concentration and/or ph to alkaline conditions. figure 8b shows the large area of interaction covered by the nop <dig> molecule in the gts <dig> in a perpendicular  view.

with regard to energy, the electrostatic potential analysis for the contact surface of both structures exhibited a highly compatible fingerprint distribution of opposite charges, i.e., positive , and negative  . there are not large areas with hydrophilic character in the contact surface between both proteins, and the formation of the complex may be mediated by a high number of direct and water-mediated h-bonds.

figure  <dig> shows the mode of interaction between arabidopsis gts <dig> and the 60s ribosomal protein l19e. the binding mechanism also occurs through the formation of a stoichiometry complex 1: <dig> between both proteins. a detailed view of this interaction is depicted in the magnified view , where the n-terminal area of gts <dig> hugs the thin structure of l19e, and the neighboring α-helix contacts the β-propeller  <dig> of gts <dig>  additionally, the n-terminal area of the l19e protein directly interacts with the residues of the central bottom side of the gts <dig> tunnel, leaving the central top side of the tunnel free as detailed in figure 8b. the same area of l19e protein is also involved in the interaction with ribonucleic acid . the electrostatic potential analysis for the contact surfaces of both structures exhibited a highly compatible fingerprint of opposite charges  .

discussion
gigantus <dig> is here described to be very important in regulating plant growth development  . this is the first time that a mutation in gts <dig> has been implicated in early germination, growth and development in arabidopsis thaliana. the molecular mechanism by which gigantus <dig> regulates plant growth development is still unknown. as a member of wd <dig> protein family, gts <dig> is expected to play central roles in different biological processes including cell division and cytokinesis, flowering, floral development, cytoskeleton dynamics, nuclear export to rna processing, transcriptional mechanism, and protein-protein interactions  <cit> . we postulate that gigantus <dig> might primarily function as a site for protein-protein interaction or mediator of transient interplay among other proteins to regulate different biological processes in plants. the development of protein complexes involves regulatory interactions that are mainly controlled by scaffolding proteins, such as wd <dig> repeat motifs. these motifs are important features of diverse protein-protein interactions  <cit> , providing an unbending platform for interactions of proteins with other cellular components and controlling therefore several vital functions of the cell, such as signaling cascades, cellular transport and apoptosis  <cit> .

the wd <dig> domains in gts <dig> protein are shown to contain seven or multiples of seven repeats forming a highly stable β-propeller structure . the 7-fold β-propeller is the most stable β-sheet geometry characterizing the resolved wd <dig> structures and also used to identify wd <dig> proteins  <cit> . however members of this protein family have been also found to contain as high as sixteen repeats  <cit> . proteins with less than  <dig> repeats form an incomplete β-propeller structure and require additional wd-repeats from their neighbors to stabilize themselves, making dimers  <cit> . there is no apparent folding order for each repeat and the order in which repeats fold might vary among different wd <dig> proteins, or even within the same protein  <cit> . these proteins are known be involved in light signaling/photomorphogenesis and flowering  <cit> , auxin response and cell division  <cit> , in meristem maintenance  <cit> , floral development  <cit> , seed development and flowering  <cit> , chromatin-based gene silencing and organogenesis  <cit> , protein turn-over, microtubule dynamics, phospholipid binding and vesicle coating  <cit> . this justifies the great deal of research interest in the wd <dig> protein superfamily across plant species. our data  suggest that gts <dig> belongs to the wd <dig> protein subfamily regulating auxin response and cell division  <cit> , meristem maintenance  <cit> , floral development  <cit> , seed development and flowering  <cit> . in this study the arabidopsis gts <dig> ligand-binding domain  lies mainly on the top surface residues, which integrates parts of β-propeller domain . however, our data revealed that gts <dig> wd <dig> propellers have three distinct surfaces available for interactions: the top region of the propeller, the bottom region , and the circumference  <cit>  , suggesting the multi-functional properties of gts <dig> protein through protein-protein interactions. indeed, protein-protein and protein-peptide interactions involved the entry site of the central channel of the β-propeller , where the majority of interaction partners  bind  <cit> . n- or c-terminal extensions of gts <dig> run parallel to the tunnel-like structure, which form the complete  <dig> wd <dig> repeat domains, making them accessible for interaction with other partners . wd <dig> domains can thus act as large interaction platforms for multiple protein interactions. in comparison to other domains, the proteins containing wd <dig> motif are components of several interaction pairs  <cit> , and act as scaffolds for larger complex assemblies. this work represents the first time the 3d-structural and molecular features of the gts <dig> protein in plants have been examined.

to better understand what area of the gts <dig> plays an important role in complex formation for functional conservation across plant species, we identified two fundamentally conserved regions; the first, located on the top rim, constituted by the residues composing blades  <dig> to  <dig>  including n- and c-terminal arms; and the second large conserved surface is located on the bottom of the propeller and is mainly composed of blades  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . these regions represent potential protein-protein interaction sites  <cit> .

in general, plant and particularly arabidopsis-wd repeat proteins are strongly conserved. most of these proteins are components of basic cellular machinery regulating plant-specific processes. an interesting question arises as to how these proteins evolved into their specific cellular roles. one of the key functional processes of wd proteins is the biogenesis of eukaryotic ribosomes, a highly regulated and dynamic process that begins in the nucleolus with transcription of rrna precursor  and rapidly packaged into the 90s ribonucleoprotein particle containing ribosomal proteins, non-ribosomal proteins, and snorna-containing ribonucleoprotein particles . the 90s pre-rnps are converted into 43s and 66s ribosome assembly intermediates, which ultimately give rise to mature 40s and 60s ribosomal subunits  <cit> . it is well known that ribosome biogenesis is driven by a large number of pre-ribosomal factors that associate with and/or dissociate from the pre-ribosomal particles along the maturation pathway. although there has been much progress to identify ribosome assembly intermediates and their protein and rna constituents  <cit> , the information about the architecture of these pre-rrnps is scarce. it is unclear which proteins are the nearest neighbors within the assembled ribosomes and to what extent neighboring molecules function together.

wd <dig> protein-protein interaction motifs represent excellent candidates to mediate interactions in the multiprotein subcomplex comprising a neighborhood in assembling ribosomes because of their protein-protein multi-interacting versatility. more than  <dig> trans-acting factors required for ribosome assembly have been identified  <cit> , as well as  <dig> additional assembly factors present in pre-ribosomes  <cit> . therefore, such wd40-containing proteins may nucleate the assembly of pre-ribosomes by interacting sequentially or simultaneously with other assembly factors or ribosomal proteins. among the assembly factors,  <dig> proteins were found to contain wd <dig> motifs  <cit> . many of the annotated ribosome biogenesis-wd <dig> repeat proteins were shown to directly interact with, or regulate the levels of other proteins  <cit>  or to be components of multiprotein subcomplexes. yeast wd <dig> protein ytm <dig> is a constituent of 66s pre-rrnps, whose depletion resulted in a deficiency of 60s ribosomal subunits  <cit> . its homologue, mammalian wdr <dig> functions in the maturation of the 60s ribosomal subunit. wdr <dig> forms a stable complex with a novel member the nucleolar proteins pes <dig> and bop <dig> , which are crucial for processing of the 32s precursor ribosomal rna  and cell proliferation  <cit> . interestingly, a potential homologous complex of pes1–bop1–wdr <dig> in yeast  is involved in the control of ribosome biogenesis and s phase entry  <cit> .

the yeast wd <dig> repeat protein mak <dig> that modulates a p21-activated protein kinase function is an essential factor in nuclear maturation of 60s ribosomal subunits and its depletion led to a cell cycle delay in g <dig>  indicating an early step nucleolar role of mak <dig> in ribosome assembly. another sub-complex, transiently associated with late, nuclear pre-60s precursors, is composed of four proteins and contains ipi <dig> as a wd <dig> repeat member  <cit> .

in this study, a new interacting counterpart, the arabidopsis nop <dig> protein was identified as a potential ribosome biogenesis factor in plants, which could be implicated in formation of the 60s ribosomal precursor. this process may be regulated by an interaction with gts <dig> . this interaction was studied using a docking analysis that showed a stable interaction between gts <dig> and nop <dig>  involving the n-terminal tail and the 4th blade of the first partner, and a cleft formed in the second ribosomal factor by the n-terminal α-helix and the neighboring secondary elements. another ribosomal protein  was found to interact with gts <dig>  l19e protein is implicated in the structural stability of ribosome. the interacting area between gts <dig> and l19e is very close to that of nop <dig> and gts <dig> interacting area . this suggests that the interacting mechanism of regulating the biogenesis nucleolar factor nop <dig> and the structural ribosome factor l19e may be competitive. therefore both steps in the 60s ribosomal subunit formation, structural maturation and stabilization may be separate in the time and/or different cellular compartments.

in support of our data are two other examples of wd <dig> repeat ribosome biogenesis factors, rrb <dig> and sqt <dig>  which interact directly with ribosomal proteins for 60s ribosomal subunit assembly. rrb <dig> interacts with the ribosomal protein rpl <dig> in the nucleus and regulates its levels  <cit> , and sqt <dig> interacts with rpl <dig> in the cytoplasm  <cit> . both proteins have a role in the association of the corresponding ribosomal protein with the nascent 60s ribosomal subunits and might regulate the levels of the corresponding ribosomal protein. other wd <dig> repeat proteins have been implicated in the formation and stabilization of the small ribosomal subunit 40s. yeast rack <dig> regulates the translation initiation by recruiting pkc to the ribosome  <cit> . four rack <dig> orthologs identified in arabidopsis thaliana may have a similar activity  <cit> . these interactions could provide a mechanism to regulate translation activities of ribosome populations programmed with specific mrnas  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present study provides substantial evidence for the role of gigantus <dig> in controlling seed germination, faster growth and biomass accumulation in plants. the gene is mainly expressed in meristemic regions and is therefore important in cell division. it is postulated to regulate growth development through diverse protein-protein interactions, including those involved in scaffolding and dynamic multi-subunit complexes such as the ribosomal protein biogenesis, stability and activity. given its rich interaction surfaces, gts <dig> functions probably as an adaptor in many different protein complexes or protein-dna complexes in very diverse cellular processes that needs further research investigation. our modeling data suggests that gts <dig> mediates molecular recognition events mainly through the smaller top surface of domain, which comprises three residues forming a transient complex with other peptides. it would be interesting to further investigate gigantus <dig> knockout genes in agronomically important crops with the aim of improving crop yield and biomass accumulation for sustainable plant-based biofuel production.
