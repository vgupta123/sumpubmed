BACKGROUND
phospholipids are major components of the cell membrane. glycerol-3-phosphate  forms the backbone of all phospholipid molecules  <cit> . phospholipid biosynthesis begins with two steps of g3p acylation, leading to the formation of phosphatidic acid . in bacteria, pa is converted to cdp-diacylglycerol, the precursor of the three major phospholipids, phosphatidylethanolamine , phosphatidylglycerol , and cardiolipin   <cit>  . earlier biochemical and genetic analyses disclosed that g3p and 1-acylglycerol-phosphate  acyltransferase are encoded by the plsb and plsc genes, respectively, in escherichia coli  <cit> . interestingly, while plsc is universally conserved in eubacteria, plsb has been identified in only a limited number of species, mainly belonging to the gamma proteobacterial group. another gene homologous to e. coli plsc, possibly encoding g3p acyltransferase, plsd, has been cloned from the clostridium butyricum genome, based on its ability to complement plsb defects in e. coli. however, the role of plsd in c. butyricum cells is currently unclear  <cit> .

e. coli plsb utilizes acyl-acp  and acyl-coa as acyl donors to synthesize 1-acyl-g3p  <cit> . recently, lu et al.  <cit>  have reported a new two-step pathway that utilizes a novel fatty acid intermediate for the initiation of phospholipid formation in streptococcus pneumoniae. they demonstrated biochemically that plsx produced a unique activated fatty acid by catalyzing the synthesis of fatty acyl-phosphate from acyl-acp, and then showed that plsy transferred the fatty acid moiety from acyl-phosphate  to g3p. the plsx gene is widely conserved in eubacteria and it had been suggested that this gene was involved in fatty acid and/or phospholipid synthesis in e. coli, although the exact role of the gene remained unknown  <cit> . in b. subtilis, plsx is essential for growth  <cit>  and plsx expression is controlled by fapr, a protein that regulates fatty acid and phospholipid biosynthesis genes  <cit> . although the plsy gene, encoding a membrane protein around  <dig> amino acids long, is also widely conserved in eubacteria  <cit> , the plsy gene function had been completely unknown.

in the gram-positive spore-forming bacterium,bacillus subtilis, we showed that  <dig> genes, including plsc  and plsx, when inactivated singly, were indispensable for growth in lb medium  <cit> . among these genes,  <dig> encoded proteins with unknown functions, and these proteins are therefore targets for development of new antibacterial agents. as part of a genetic study to identify the functions of these genes, here we show that the b. subtilis ortholog of s. pneumoniae plsy, ynes, is required for g3p acyltransferase activity, together with plsx. the b. subtilis genome lacks plsb, and our results demonstrate in vivo that the plsx/y pathway is essential for the growth of bacteria lacking plsb. interestingly, in addition to plsb, e. coli possesses plsx and the plsy ortholog, ygih. thus, we explored the functional relationship between plsb, plsx and ygih in e. coli, and found that, although plsb plays the principal role in 1-acyl-g3p synthesis, plsx and ygih are also important for optimal e. coli growth.

RESULTS
isolation of a b. subtilis ynes-ts mutant
to explore the functions of essential genes of unknown function, we adopted a strategy to isolate temperature-sensitive  mutants of these genes and then to seek extragenic suppressors of the ts genes. to generate a ts mutation in ynes, we initially introduced a nonfunctional chloramphenicol-resistant gene  downstream of ynes, and transformed cells with the ynes-functional cat fragment mutagenized by pcr in vitro. chloramphenicol-resistant transformants were selected at 30°c, and colonies that were unable to grow above 42°c were analyzed. in this manner, we isolated a ts mutant of ynes  that had a one-base substitution altering val <dig> to glu in the c-terminal cytoplasmic region of the protein.

mapping of the suppressor mutation site in the ynes-ts sup- <dig> strain
next, we isolated a spontaneous extragenic suppressor mutant of the ts phenotype  by cultivation at the restrictive temperature. transformation of wild-type strain  <dig> cells with chromosomal dna of my <dig> led to the ts growth of more than 90% of chloramphenicol-resistant transformants, indicating that the sup- <dig> mutation was not linked to the ynes gene. my <dig> cells lost sporulation ability, and the spo- phenotype was maintained in my <dig> cells  in which the ynes-ts gene was replaced with wild-type ynes under control of the iptg-dependent pspac promoter. a dna fragment  that complemented the spo- phenotype of my <dig> in trans was isolated from a b. subtilis genomic dna library in which an mboi partial digest was ligated with the phage vector, φcm, as described previously  <cit> . the  <dig> kb fragment was cut into  <dig>  kb and  <dig> kb fragments. the  <dig> kb fragment with the cat gene of the phage vector was cloned into pbr <dig>  while the  <dig>  kb fragment was ligated into pca <dig> containing the cat gene  <cit> . my <dig> cells were transformed with these plasmids for integration into the chromosome via single crossovers. the results indicated that the  <dig> kb fragment allowed recovery of the ability to sporulate, while the  <dig>  kb fragment did not. sequencing of the  <dig> kb fragment revealed three genes. these were the 3'-terminal region of glpf, encoding the glycerol uptake facilitator, and full-length glpk and glpd, encoding glycerol kinase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, respectively. because glpf and glpk constitute an operon, and because the cloned  <dig> kb fragment did not contain the promoter sequence  <cit> , glpk was possibly not expressed from the fragment cloned in φcm. the glpd promoter between glpk and glpd has, however, been identified  <cit> . these results suggested that the mutation responsible for the spo- phenotype mapped in the glpd gene. to confirm this theory, full-length wild type glpd , the 5'-terminal half of the gene , and the 3'-terminal half , were separately cloned into pca <dig>  the resulting constructs were integrated into the my <dig> chromosome by single crossovers and the sporulation abilities of transformants were examined. the 5'-terminal region of glpd, and the full-length gene, conveyed the ability to sporulate, but the 3'-terminal glpd region did not. sequencing of the  <dig>  kb 5'-terminal half of glpd in my <dig>  revealed a single base  insertion between nucleotides c  <dig> and g  <dig>  which resulted in inactivation of the gene. this result was consistent with the previous finding that glpd inactivation impairs sporulation ability  <cit> .

we further confirmed that glpd inactivation suppressed the ynes-ts phenotype by insertion of a plasmid, pmutinnc  <cit> , carrying an internal segment of the glpd gene, into the glpd gene of ynes-ts cells .

increases in intracellular g3p concentration suppress the ynes-ts phenotype
the intracellular g3p concentration is known to be elevated in glpd mutants  <cit> . we speculated that increases in the g3p level might suppress the ynes-ts phenotype. indeed, we found that supplementation of the growth medium  with  <dig> %  g3p, or glycerol, complemented the ynes-ts phenotype . growth of my <dig>  and my <dig>  cells was impaired compared to glpd+ cells , when glycerol or g3p was supplemented in the growth medium. this phenotype was also observed in my <dig>  cells . given that accumulation of g3p is known to result in abnormal septation and inhibition of sporulation  <cit> , an increase in the intracellular concentration of g3p would explain the growth impairment of cells without glpd. it should be noted that g3p and glycerol did not complement the growth defect resulting from ynes depletion in the iptg-dependent ynes mutant cells, strain ynesp  <cit>  . the ynes-ts mutant protein will retain a reduced activity at high temperature, although the activity is insufficient to support cell growth. residual activity would be enhanced by increases in the intracellular concentrations of g3p or glycerol.

phospholipid synthesis in b. subtilis plsc-ts, ynes-ts, and iptg-dependent plsx mutants, under restrictive conditions
g3p is a substrate for g3p acyltransferase, and inhibition of g3p acyltransferase activity as a result of simultaneous mutations in plsb and plsx in e. coli led to g3p auxotrophy  <cit> . accordingly, we examined the involvement of ynes in 1-acyl-g3p synthesis by analyzing phospholipid synthesis in ynes-ts cells at the restrictive temperature. we additionally constructed mutations in genes possibly involved in phospholipid synthesis. these included a ts mutation in plsc, in which  <dig> c-terminal residues were deleted , and an iptg-dependent plsx mutation in strain my <dig> 

to determine phospholipid biosynthesis rates, b. subtilis cells were pulse-labeled with  <dig>  for  <dig> min. phospholipids were extracted using the method of bligh and dyer  <cit> , and separated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography  <cit> . we detected pa, pg, pe, and cl in wild-type cells growing at either 30°c or 42°c . when plsc-ts cells were labeled at 30°c, a pattern similar to that of wild-type cells was obtained. at the restrictive temperature, however, 1-acyl-g3p accumulation was observed, and phospholipid synthesis did not take place . this is consistent with the known 1-acyl-g3p acyltransferase activity of plsc. in contract, no phospholipids were detectable in ynes-ts cells following a shift to the restrictive temperature . our data indicate that ynes inactivation results in blockage of the first step in phospholipid synthesis in b. subtilis cells. furthermore, plsx depletion in iptg-dependent mutant cells induces a similar change in phospholipid composition . the results are consistent with the two-step mechanism of 1-acyl-g3p synthesis reported by lu et al.  <cit> , and show that the plsx/y pathway is essential for growth of b. subtilis lacking plsb.

functional relationship between plsb, plsx and ynes/ygih in e. coli
it is generally believed that e. coli plsb is essential for bacterial growth, although experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis has yet to be obtained, and transposon mutagenesis experiments suggested that plsx is dispensable in e. coli  <cit> . the ortholog of s. pneumoniae plsy and b. subtilis ynes in e. coli, ygih, is yet another dispensable gene  <cit> . accordingly, we determined the functional relationship between plsb, plsx, and ygih, in e. coli.

we initially attempted to systematically inactivate e. coli genes either singly or in combination. for this purpose, we replaced the plsx and ygih genes with a kanamycin-resistance gene  using the method of datsenko and wanner  <cit> . inactivation of plsb was performed in the presence of plasmid-borne plsb. phage p <dig> transduction frequencies of each allele into cells of various genetic backgrounds were measured to avoid possible effects of secondary mutations arising during gene inactivation . the results, summarized in table  <dig>  show that plsb is essential for e. coli growth, while single deletions of either plsx or ygih do not affect cell growth. these results suggested that plsb plays a principal role in g3p acyltransferase activity in e. coli. additionally, to examine whether plsb function might be complemented by overexpression of other genes, we introduced derivatives of plasmid pstv <dig> or pstv <dig>  harboring e. coli plsx and ygih, and b. subtilis plsx and ynes into recipient strains for p <dig> transduction, without restoration of plsb function. unexpectedly, although single deletions of plsx or ygih did not affect cell growth, we found that the simultaneous inactivation of plsx and ygih was impossible , indicating that plsx and ygih also have important roles in e. coli growth. next, we expressed b. subtilis plsx and ynes genes in e. coli, and also the corresponding e. coli genes . the lethal phenotype of the plsx and ygih double deletion was suppressed by b. subtilis plsx or ynes, indicating that these genes were able to complement the plsx and ygih e. coli gene activities. in addition, a plsx and ygih double deletion was possible when plsb was overexpressed from pstv29plsb. to obtain further insights into the functional relationships between plsb, plsx and ygih, we next introduced a plasmid harboring a mutated plsb gene  into e. coli, and then attempted to inactivate plsb, plsx or ygih . the plsb <dig> gene has a point mutation that changes gly <dig> to ala, reducing the affinity of plsb <dig> for g3p  <cit> . in the presence of plasmid-borne plsb <dig>  genomic plsb could be inactivated, indicating that plsb <dig> protein expressed from the plasmid-borne gene could support e. coli growth. the plasmid-borne gene could not, however, complement the lethality of the plsx and ygih double deletion. furthermore, while native plsb could be inactivated in the presence of psvt29plsb <dig> in cells lacking functional ygih, plsb inactivation became impossible in cells with inactivated plsx, indicating that plsx activity becomes indispensable for the growth of cells when the plsb activity is supplied by a plasmid copy of plsb <dig>

the essential nature of plsb, and the lethality of the plsx and ygih double deletion, were further confirmed using inducible forms of these genes. to this end, we placed the coding sequences of plsb, plsx and ygih under the control of an iaa -inducible trp promoter , integrated the genes into the chromosome as described in methods, and then deleted the native copies of either plsb alone, or both plsx and ygih. as expected, strains mec <dig> , mec <dig>  and mec <dig>  cells displayed iaa-dependent growth .

the plsb and plsx enzymes utilize acyl-acp as acyl-donor, and abnormal accumulation of acyl-acp has been shown to result in growth impairment  <cit> . to examine acyl-acp accumulation in cells with inactivated plsx and ygih genes, we introduced a derivative of puc <dig>  harboring the e. coli tesa gene encoding thioesterase i  <cit> , into cells of strains mec <dig> and mec <dig>  interestingly, the growth defects of these strains in the absence of iaa were suppressed by the additional supply of thioesterase i  . we have not yet succeeded in demonstrating the expected tesa-dependent suppression of the inability to achieve plsx inactivation when plsb activity is supplied by a plasmid encoding plsb <dig>  this is because it is difficult to construct an appropriate strain in which to examine the hypothesis.

complementation of the plsb activity by a combination of plsx and ynes/ygih
as we found that the combination of plsx and ynes conferred the ability to synthesize 1-acyl-g3p upon b. subtilis, we expected that simultaneous overexpression of these two proteins would complement a plsb mutation in e. coli. to test this hypothesis, we introduced various combinations of plasmids harboring plsx and ynes/ygih into e. coli cells. in these experiments, we employed derivatives of plasmid pmw <dig> , whose replication is compatible with that of pstv28/ <dig> derivatives, when more than one cloned gene was to be expressed. we successfully complemented the e. coli plsb mutation by expression of b. subtilis plsx and ynes . the complementation of the e. coli plsb activity by the b. subtilis plsx and ynes combination was also demonstrated using an iaa-inducible plsb gene . other gene combinations, including those with e. coli genes, did not complement plsb. plasmid pmw118ygih complemented the growth defect of mec <dig> and mec <dig> cells in the absence of iaa , indicating that functional ygih is expressed from pmw118ygih. although we could not determine the expression levels of the various proteins due to the lack of appropriate antibodies, the specific activities of e. coli plsx and ygih may be lower than those of their b. subtilis counterparts.

discussion
our genetic studies have shown that plsx and ynes  are essential for g3p acyltransferase activity in b. subtilis cells, and that the combination of the two b. subtilis proteins complements plsb activity in e. coli cells. our findings are consistent with the two-step mechanism of 1-acyl-g3p synthesis reported by lu et al.  <cit> , and we have shown that the plsx/y pathway is essential for the growth of b. subtilis lacking plsb. the combination of plsx and plsy is widely conserved in eubacteria, but most eubacteria lack plsb  <cit> , strongly suggesting that plsx/y will be essential genes in these bacteria.

a number of bacteria, belonging mainly to the gamma group of proteobacteria, possess both plsb and plsx/plsy, however. another important finding reported here is that, in such cases, the relationship between the two 1-acyl-g3p synthesis pathways may be variable and complex. although plsb has been reported to be dispensable in pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> , we found that the gene is indispensable in e. coli, indicating that plsb is principally responsible for 1-acyl-g3p synthesis in e. coli. on the other hand, we found that simultaneous inactivation of both plsx and plsy is impossible, and that this lethality was complemented by overexpression of plsb. as single deletions in either plsx or ygih did not affect cell growth, the lethality of the plsx and ygih double deletion cannot be because of inactivation of a minor pathway  for 1-acyl-g3p synthesis.

interestingly, plsx activity becomes indispensable for growth of e. coli cells in which plsb activity is supplied from a plasmid copy of plsb <dig>  growth, in minimal medium, of e. coli sj <dig> cells harboring the plsb mutation on the chromosome is dependent on a supply of exogenous g3p. depletion of g3p in the growth medium has been found to result in accumulation of acyl-acp due to the blockage of 1-acyl-g3p synthesis, leading to a severe reduction in fatty acid biosynthesis because accumulated acyl-acp causes feedback inhibition of enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . g3p-acyltransferase activity expressed from a plasmid-borne copy of plsb <dig> may be less than that in wild type cells, and acyl-acp may therefore accumulate in such cells. plsx may be able to suppress the deleterious accumulation of acyl-acp by converting acyl-acp to acyl-po <dig>  plsy may also be involved in control of the intracellular acyl-acp concentration. e. coli plsb has been shown to utilize both acyl-acp and acyl-coa as acyl donors in the synthesis of 1-acyl-g3p  <cit> , but does not use these donors to make acyl-po <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand, s. pneumoniae plsy has been shown to synthesize 1-acyl-g3p using both acyl-acp and acyl-po <dig>  these results suggest that e. coli plsy, in the absence of plsx, may synthesize 1-acyl-g3p using acyl-acp, and this activity would then contribute to consumption of acyl-acp. it is therefore possible that both plsx and plsy contribute independently to the maintenance of an appropriate intracellular acyl-acp concentration, and simultaneous inactivation of both proteins therefore results in deleterious accumulation of acyl-acp. overexpression of plsb increases 1-acyl-g3p synthesis activity and may suppress the accumulation of acyl-acp resulting from the plsx and ygih double deletion. suppression of growth defects due to the plsx and ygih double deletion by overexpression of thioesterase i strongly supports our hypothesis.

acyl-acp has been shown to be not only a central cofactor for fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis, but also a regulatory molecule, coordinating the synthesis of these lipids with cell growth. our results strongly suggest that plsx, plsy and plsb form a complex network functioning to supply appropriate levels of lipid biosynthetic precursors, especially acyl-acp. in turn, this controls the synthesis of 1-acyl-g3p in e. coli cells, resulting in appropriate levels of 1-acyl-g3p under various growth conditions. further studies are needed to reveal the precise roles of plsx, plsy and plsb.

CONCLUSIONS
both plsx and ynes are essential for 1-acyl-g3p synthesis in b. subtilis cells lacking plsb, in agreement with recent reports on the biochemical functions of these genes. both genes will be essential for bacterial growth lacking plsb. in e. coli, plsb plays a principal role in 1-acyl-g3p synthesis and is also essential for bacterial growth. plsx and ygih also, however, play important roles in e. coli growth, probably by regulating the intracellular concentrations of acyl-acp at appropriate levels. these proteins are therefore important targets for the development of new antibacterial reagents.
