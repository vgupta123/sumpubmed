BACKGROUND
the intestinal epithelial barrier  is the first boundary between the organism and the luminal environment. it plays a dual role by allowing the passage of nutrients and electrolytes but preventing the passage of pathogens. the maintenance of its homeostasis is of utmost importance for the survival of the organism. the ieb is formed by a monolayer of specialized intestinal epithelial cells  under constant renewal and maintained together via various cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions. the ieb is part of a complex network of specialized cell types constituting its microenvironment such as immune cells, subepithelial fibroblasts, endothelial cells or luminal bacteria. emerging evidences suggest that under physiological conditions, the ieb's functions are actively regulated by its cellular microenvironment  <cit> . for instance, myofibroblasts have been shown to enhance epithelial cell proliferation and intestinal epithelial restitution  <cit> . in addition, microbiota have been shown to control both the maturation and the maintenance of the ieb  <cit> .

the enteric nervous system  is also a major constituent of the cellular microenvironment of the ieb. indeed ieb and, in particular, the proliferative compartment of the crypts are densely innervated by nerve fibres originating mainly from the submucosal plexus. recent data have shown that, besides controlling secretory processes, activation of enteric neurons can reduce iec proliferation and barrier permeability, in particular via the release of vasoactive intestinal peptide   <cit> . enteric neurons innervating the ieb are also closely associated with enteric glial cells , the major constituent of the ens.

for many years, egc have been considered as mainly passive and structural cells supporting neurons and ganglions. however, this concept has lately been revisited mainly focused on the role played by astrocytes in the central nervous system   <cit> . besides controlling and regulating neuronal functions, increasing evidence suggests that egc could be major regulators of ieb functions, similar to astrocytes controlling blood brain barrier functions  <cit> . supporting this concept, recent data have demonstrated that egc can profoundly inhibit iec proliferation, in part via the liberation of tgf-Î² <dig>  <cit> . egc also decrease ieb paracellular permeability via the release of s-nitrosoglutathione   <cit> . furthermore, in vivo lesions of egc network increase ieb paracellular permeability and iec proliferation and, at term, lead to major lethal intestinal inflammation  <cit> . however, the role of egc in the control of other major iec functions such as cell differentiation, cell-to-cell or cell-to-matrix adhesion, and the associated regulatory pathways remains largely unknown.

therefore, in our study, we combined transcriptomic studies as well as functional studies to determine the impact of egc on the regulation of major genes and functions involved in ieb homeostasis. microarray approach was used to identify egc-induced modifications in gene expression profiling of proliferating caco- <dig>  the identified genes and related functional pathways are consistent with the concept that egc are a major constituent of the ieb microenvironment favoring barrier protection.

RESULTS
enteric glial cells modulate intestinal epithelial cells transcriptome
microarray experiments
we performed microarray analysis of egc influence on the transcriptome of caco- <dig> cells using oligonucleotide chips  developed at west genopole transcriptome core facility of nantes. these microarrays contain around  <dig>  genes and are dedicated to gene expression studies in caco- <dig> cell line as well as to gene expression signature studies of multiple tumors. caco- <dig> cells were cultured onto transwell filters in the absence or presence of egc seeded at the bottom of the wells for  <dig> or  <dig> hours. the transwell filters did not allowed any contact between iec and egc, thus implicating only paracrine communication between the two cell types.

hierarchical clustering of the whole data showed the impact of the time of culture as well as the impact of the presence of egc on the transcriptional profiling of iec, i.e. caco- <dig> cells . we observed changes in iec transcriptome over the  <dig> hours of culture in control condition. at  <dig> hours, differences in transcriptome profiling already existed in control condition as compared to t =  <dig>  in general, the observed changes in differentially expressed genes between t =  <dig> and t =  <dig> hours in control conditions were increased in the same way of regulation when reaching t =  <dig> hours . these changes might be due to the growth and differentiation of the proliferating iec over the  <dig> hours of culture. we observed no major differences in gene expression profiling between iec cultured alone and iec cultured in presence of egc at  <dig> hours of culture. in contrast, at  <dig> hours, egc presence led to consistent and major changes in iec gene expression profiling .

gene expression modulated by egc
using genespring software, we aimed to identify statistically significant differences in gene expression profiling between caco- <dig> cells cultured alone or in presence of egc. after  <dig> h of culture, no significant difference in gene expression profiling was found between iec cultured alone  or in presence of egc . however, after  <dig> hours of culture, we identified  <dig> genes differentially expressed between control and egc conditions by using two different strategies. benjamini and hochberg false discovery rate method was used to determine  <dig> differentially expressed genes between control and glia conditions at t =  <dig> hours, and we also selected  <dig> genes with a two-fold change and student's t-test p-value less than or equal to  <dig> . among the  <dig> differentially expressed genes,  <dig> genes were down-regulated and  <dig> were up-regulated in iec cultured with egc as compared to control . quantitative pcr was also performed on various genes to validate the microarray results. in particular, results showed an egc-induced increase of cdh <dig>  fn <dig>  lama <dig>  pparg, ptk <dig> mrna expression in iec and a decrease of e2f <dig>  fgfr <dig>  gpx <dig> and smad <dig> mrna expression in iec, similar to the data obtained with microarrays . we next sought to determine the specificity of egc effects upon iec transcriptome by characterizing the impact of fibroblasts on the expression of these genes in iec. under identical culture conditions, we showed that fibroblasts increased expression of ptk <dig> but did not significantly modify gene expression of cdh <dig>  fn <dig>  lama <dig>  pparg, e2f <dig>  gpx <dig> and smad <dig> in iec .

hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes
hierarchical clustering was used to visualize the expression profile of the  <dig> genes induced or repressed by egc after  <dig> hours of culture .

all these genes exhibit a differential expression between control and egc conditions at t =  <dig> hours. furthermore, some of them already exhibited a slight difference in expression profile between control and egc conditions at  <dig> hours. these results indicate that egc effects on genes identified as differentially expressed in iec at  <dig> hours probably started as early as at  <dig> hours, even though the modifications were not statistically significant.

two groups of samples exhibited a very different profile from other samples: egc condition at t =  <dig> hours and controls at t =  <dig> hours . these observations confirm that 1) no major changes existed between control and egc conditions at t =  <dig> hours and 2) that the  <dig> hour-time of culture impacted on gene expression profiling in iec, likely reflecting differentiation of iec over the time of culture.

egc regulate iec functions
gene network interactions
biological interactions among the  <dig> genes of the gene set provided by genespring analysis were identified using ingenuity pathways analysis. among the  <dig> genes differentially expressed, ingenuity identified  <dig> genes contributing to a total of  <dig> functional networks . each of the  <dig> first networks contained at least  <dig> genes that were associated with cell-to-cell signalling and interaction, cellular growth and proliferation, cell morphology, cellular movement, cell death and cell cycle. the  <dig> genes were also classified into ingenuity cellular and molecular pathways as well as into ingenuity signalling pathways . all the functions described above and identified by building functional networks among our gene set were found in the  <dig> cellular and molecular functions obtained with ingenuity . moreover, these  <dig> functions were among the  <dig> first functions presenting the highest score . finally, the signalling pathways identified by the ingenuity analysis of our gene set were also relevant to those  <dig> functions . the limit of ingenuity analysis for our study is that it is not restricted to one specific organ or cell, so that all the results of ingenuity analysis could not be transposed directly to the regulation of iec functions by egc. we therefore performed an "epithelial" specific analysis of the major functions identified with ingenuity.

cell-to cell and cell-to-matrix interaction
egc regulated the expression of numerous genes involved in the control of iec adhesive processes. in particular, egc induced an up-regulation of the expression of all  <dig> genes with pro-adhesive functions and a down-regulation of the  <dig> genes with anti adhesive properties, among the gene set found to be differentially expressed in iec cultured in presence of egc . these genes are crucially involved in the control of cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix adhesion.

first, egc concomitantly increased the expression of cdh- <dig>  which encodes e-cadherin, and decreased the expression of cdk5r <dig>  e-cadherin is the major component of the adherent junction complexes and the level of e-cadherin in iec is to be correlated to adhesion complexes formation between iec  <cit> . further evidences confirming a pro-adhesive influence of egc on iec is the egc-induced down-regulation of cdk5r <dig> expression. indeed, cdk5r <dig> encodes p <dig>  a regulator of cdk- <dig> , which induces the degradation of e-cadherin precursor  <cit> . in addition, egc also up-regulated iqgap <dig> expression in iec. this gene encodes for a protein member of iqgap family that interacts with several molecules controlling cytoskeleton organization, cell adhesion and cell motility such as cdc <dig> and rac  <cit> . interestingly, iqgap <dig> has been shown to mediate e-cadherin-based cell-to-cell adhesion during development  <cit> . all these results suggest that egc enhance cell-to-cell adhesion in iec.

our data also demonstrate that egc modulate the expression of genes that are involved in cell-to-matrix interactions. first, egc increased expression of several genes encoding proteins of the extracellular matrix such as lama <dig>  lamc <dig> and fn <dig>  lama <dig> and lamc <dig> encode respectively for laminin Î± <dig> and Î³ <dig> chains which, together with laminin Î² <dig> chain, compose laminin- <dig>  <cit> . laminin- <dig> has been shown to be the most adhesive substratum of laminin isoforms when studying abilities of laminin- <dig> - <dig> and - <dig> in modulating caco- <dig> cell adhesion  <cit> . furthermore, egc up-regulated fn <dig> expression, encoding the fibronectin protein. interestingly, fibronectin has recently been shown to enhance caco- <dig> cell attachment and wound healing  <cit> . egc down-regulated klk <dig> expression, which encodes klk   <dig>  an extracellular serine protease which has been shown to cleave and digest various extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen iv, laminin and fibronectin  <cit> . in addition, egc up-regulated ptk <dig> expression in iec which may result in increased expression of fak  protein, a major regulator of focal adhesions turnover and maturation  <cit> . finally, egc induced an up-regulation of krt <dig> expression whose increased expression has recently been shown to cause enhanced adhesion of human breast tumor cells to their extracellular matrix  <cit> .

in conclusion, our data suggest that egc regulation of iec transcriptome leads to an increase in cell adhesion. in order to functionally validate this hypothesis, we performed in vitro experiments using established adhesion assays. under these conditions, we first showed that iec global adhesion was increased after  <dig> hours of culture with egc as compared to control . we next confirmed whether these effects were in part associated with an increase in cell-to-matrix adhesion as the majority of iec genes regulated by egc presence appeared to favor cell-to-matrix adhesion. indeed, cell-to-matrix adhesion assays revealed that egc significantly increased iec adhesion to the filter as compared to control .

cell differentiation
egc also regulated the expression of numerous genes involved in iec differentiation. in particular, egc up-regulated the expression of  <dig> genes enhancing differentiation and down-regulated  <dig> genes known to inhibit iec differentiation .

egc induced an up-regulation of the expression of pro-differentiative genes or genes associated with enhanced differentiation of iec such as pparg, lama <dig>  ptk <dig>  cdh- <dig>  dctn <dig> and dynlt <dig>  indeed, pparÎ³, encoding the well-described nuclear receptor superfamily member peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma  has been shown to regulate iec differentiation and its expression has been positively correlated with level of differentiation of caco- <dig> and ht <dig> cells  <cit> . moreover, a diminution of laminin-a <dig> in a murine model resulted in a transformation from a small intestinal to a colonic mucosal architecture, suggesting that laminin-Î± <dig> has a crucial role in establishing and maintaining the architecture of the small intestine  <cit> . in addition, it has already been shown that the differentiation of caco- <dig> cells was accompanied by an increase in fak expression  <cit> . e-cadherin, whose corresponding gene cdh- <dig> is up-regulated by egc, has been largely demonstrated to be involved in the establishment of a differentiated phenotype for iec. notably, e-cadherin has been described to be less expressed at the bottom of the crypts where iec are undifferentiated  <cit> . the down-regulation by egc of cdk5r <dig> expression, leading to enhanced levels of e-cadherin , might also further enhance egc-induced cell differentiation. egc also increased dctn <dig> and dynlt <dig> expression, two genes encoding a subunit of dynactin  and dynein light chain rp <dig>  respectively. both are involved in post-golgi movement of vesicles towards apical surface of differentiated enterocytes  <cit> , and could therefore reflect increased differentiation of iec induced by egc. intriguingly, although differentiation of the caco- <dig> cell line has been shown to be correlated with a down-regulation in fibronectin expression  <cit> , egc induced an up-regulation in fn <dig> expression in iec in our study.

egc decreased the expression of genes that encode proteins implicated in anti-differentiative pathways such as e2f <dig>  bag <dig> and cdk5r <dig> . e2f <dig> is a gene encoding a protein member of the e2f family of transcription factors and has been shown to be down-regulated in confluent human iec and differentiated enterocytes  <cit> . bag <dig>  encoding a bcl- <dig> non-homologous associated molecule, has also been shown to present a decreasing gradient of expression from the base of the crypts to the apex of the villi, suggesting that the down-regulation of bag <dig> might reflect a differentiation state of iec  <cit> .

in conclusion, based on our analysis, egc-mediated regulation of iec transcriptome appears to strongly favor iec differentiation.

cell motility
egc regulated in iec the expression of genes encoding proteins that are known to play a role in iec motility . in particular, egc induced an increase in fn <dig> expression in iec. fn <dig> has been demonstrated as a major factor in promoting cell migration of iec and subepithelial fibroblasts, thus favoring epithelial wound healing  <cit> . interestingly, egc induced a down-regulation in lsp <dig> expression in iec. lsp <dig> gene encodes for lsp <dig>  a cytoplasmic actin-binding protein, whose overexpression in melanoma cells has been described to inhibit cell motility  <cit> . egc-induced up-regulation of ptk <dig> expression also supports a role of egc in promoting iec motility. indeed, increased fak protein level promoted epithelial restitution via an increased iec migration  <cit> . similarly, the increased pparÎ³ expression could enhance cell motility as inhibitors of pparÎ³ inhibit epithelial cell migration  <cit> .

cell proliferation
expression of genes involved in cell proliferation was differentially regulated in iec cultured in presence of egc as compared to control . in fact, egc appeared to modulate the expression of anti-proliferative and pro-proliferative genes toward a dominant anti-proliferative effect .

the expression of major anti-proliferative and pro-proliferative genes was found to be up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, by egc. in particular, pparg, txnip and btg <dig> expressions in iec were up-regulated by egc. pparÎ³ activation has been described both in vivo and in vitro to inhibit intestinal epithelial cell proliferation  <cit>  and to induce a g <dig> phase cell cycle arrest  <cit> . furthermore, txnip encodes the thioredoxin-interacting protein, a negative regulator of thioredoxin. thioredoxin is an important growth-promoting factor of iec  <cit> . moreover, txnip has also recently been suggested to be a tumor suppressor gene in hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit>  and interestingly, txnip expression is decreased in colorectal cancer and ulcerative colitis  <cit> . similarly, btg <dig> has been shown to negatively regulate cell proliferation and to present a maximal expression during g0/g <dig> phases of the cell cycle in fibroblasts  <cit> . further reinforcing the anti-proliferative effects of egc on iec is the egc-induced down-regulation of the expression of pro-proliferative genes such as e2f <dig>  fgfr <dig> and ppil <dig>  e2f <dig> is a gene encoding a protein member of the e2f family of transcription factors that regulate cell cycle progression by modulating expression of proteins required for the g1/s transition. it has been well described that growth stimulatory signals lead to active e2f <dig> accumulation and s-phase entry  <cit> . fgfr <dig> encodes a member of the fgf  receptor family with high affinity for kgf  which is a major actor in the mesenchymal stimulation of epithelial cell proliferation  <cit> . finally, ppil <dig>  which encodes a cyclophilin-related protein, ppil <dig> , implicated in spliceosome activation, has recently been described to be overexpressed in colon tumors and ppil <dig> silencing led to an inhibition of colon cancer cell growth  <cit> .

these global anti-proliferative effects of egc upon iec have to be associated with the egc-induced modulation of genes that would tend to be pro-proliferative, although these are clearly in reduced numbers. for instance, egc increase mki <dig> expression, which encodes the proliferation marker ki- <dig>  indeed, ki- <dig> is increasingly expressed during the cell cycle phases  <cit> , excepted in g <dig> or in cells just escaping from g <dig>  <cit> . its function is still unclear but knock-down for ki- <dig> in cancerous cells leads to an inhibition of proliferation mainly via an induction of apoptosis  <cit> . interestingly, egc reduced the expression of tp53rk and sfrp <dig> in iec that encode proteins involved in anti-proliferative pathways. tp53rk encodes prpk which is a short kinase that phosphorylates p <dig>  enhancing its transcriptional activity  <cit>  and suppressing cell cycle transition g1/s  <cit> . sfrp <dig> encodes the protein sfrp <dig> , which is an inhibitor of the wnt-signaling cascade through binding and sequestering wnt ligand and, thus, has been shown to decrease cell proliferation in many cell lines  <cit> .

taken together, these data suggest that egc tend to shift iec transcriptome toward an anti-proliferative phenotype. these results could lead to the identification of specific targets responsible for the anti proliferative effects of egc previously reported  <cit> . in addition, this global effect is supported further by the observation that egc inhibit cell proliferation in part by inducing a cell cycle arrest in g0/g <dig> phase  <cit> .

cell survival
egc differentially regulated in iec the expression of genes involved in cell death. egc appeared to modulate the expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic genes toward a dominant pro-apoptotic effect .

indeed, expressions of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes were found to be up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, by egc. in particular, bnip <dig> and casp <dig> expression in iec were up-regulated by egc. casp <dig>  coding for the caspase- <dig> pro-apoptotic protein has been shown to induce cell death  <cit> , like bnip <dig> which encodes a pro-apoptotic protein member of bcl- <dig> family  <cit> . conversely, asah- <dig>  gpx <dig> and bag- <dig> were down-regulated by egc. bag- <dig> encodes a known anti-apoptotic protein implicated in bcl- <dig> signalling pathway  <cit> . asah- <dig> encodes acid ceramidase, an enzyme that catabolizes ceramide into sphingosine by deacylation. overexpression of acid ceramidase in cells confers on them an increased resistance to cell death induced by various factors such as tnf  or anti-cancerous drugs  <cit> . finally, gpx <dig> encodes a member of the glutathione peroxidase  family and is a selenoprotein and a glutathione peroxidase. gpx <dig> is expressed in iec  <cit>  and inhibits oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line mcf- <dig>  <cit> .

these global pro-apoptotic effects of egc upon iec have to be considered also in view of the egc-mediated regulation of genes which would tend to be anti-apoptotic, although these are in reduced number. in particular, egc up-regulated the expression of tubb <dig>  a gene encoding the class iii isotype of Î²-tubulin. silencing of class iii Î²-tubulin by sirna reverted anti-cancer agent-resistant cells to a sensitive phenotype and promoted apoptosis  <cit> . conversely, egc inhibited the expression of card <dig> which encodes the card <dig> protein, a member of the ced4/apaf- <dig> family and known to induce apoptosis when expressed in cells  <cit> .

egc-induced regulation of genes involved in cell death has probably no clear consequences on iec survival. this is consistent with a previous study showing that egc did not modify iec survival  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present study described the impact of egc upon the transcriptome of proliferating caco- <dig> cells in a validated non-contact co-culture model of egc and iec  <cit> . the results obtained confirmed the known role of egc in the control of some ieb functions and, more interestingly, extended their role in the control of novel major ieb and iec functions. this study further reinforced the emerging concept that egc are an important component of the ieb environment with major protective effects. indeed, the major pathways regulated by egc in iec identified with microarrays lead to enhanced cell adhesion, differentiation, and motility, which could favor repair, and reduced cell proliferation.

an important result of this study is the putative identification of genes involved in the anti-proliferative effects of egc. indeed, egc have been shown to have potent anti-proliferative effects upon iec  <cit> . interestingly, these effects were associated with an induction of a cell cycle blockade in the g0/g <dig> phase  <cit>  but were not associated with significant cell death  <cit> . these results are globally confirmed, as there was no clear trend in the egc-induced modulation of genes controlling cell survival in iec but a trend toward an up-regulation of the expression of genes involved in anti-proliferative pathways.

a major finding of our study is that egc regulated the expression of genes involved in cell adhesion and differentiation toward a global increase of iec adhesive properties. these results can be analyzed in view of the known effects of egc upon ieb. indeed, in vitro studies have shown that egc increase ieb resistance and decrease ieb paracellular permeability  <cit> . in the present study, we also demonstrated that egc could increase global ieb adhesion, in part by increasing cell-to-matrix adhesion. these results are in agreement with in vivo data showing that selective lesions of egc lead to increased paracellular permeability and major ieb breakdown associated with the development of intestinal inflammation. however, the role of the molecular actors involved in these processes such as fibronectin, laminin or cytokeratin remains to be investigated. egc might also favor barrier integrity by increasing its resistance to inflammatory stress either by its ability to down-regulate inflammatory genes such as card <dig> or by increasing iec production of anti-inflammatory mediators such as vip  <cit> .

another important finding of this study is the observation that egc might regulate iec metabolism. in particular, egc up-regulated genes involved in lipid metabolism such as aadac, mgll or apoh, encoding respectively the arylacetamide deacetylase, monoglyceride lipase  and apolipoprotein h  <cit> . interestingly, inhibitors of mgl which is a serine hydrolase that converts 2-arachidonoylglycerol, a ligand of canabinoid receptors, to fatty acids and glycerol, increased gut transit time  <cit>  but its impact on ieb functions remain unknown. egc also modulated the expression of genes involved in protein metabolism such as ctsh that encodes cathepsin h, a lysosomal cysteine proteinase  <cit> . in addition, egc increased the expression of genes involved in arginine metabolic pathway that are slc7a <dig> and ass, which encode respectively for the cationic amino acid transporter ylat <dig> and the argininosuccinate synthetase, enzyme catalyzing the penultimate step of the arginine biosynthetic pathways. the functional impact of egc upon iec metabolism needs to be investigated in future studies.

regulation of ieb functions by egc occurs mainly via paracrine pathways. the majority of egc effects upon ieb functions are reproduced by glial-derived conditioned medium. in addition, various mediators have been identified as being involved in the control of cell proliferation or paracellular permeability. our study supports the role of mediators such as tgf-Î² <dig> as a regulator of gene pathways modulated by egc in iec. in fact, tgf-Î² <dig> has been shown to increase the expression of fak  <cit> , tgfbi  <cit>  or vip  <cit> . egc have also been shown to produce il- <dig>  <cit> . il- <dig> has recently been identified as a key molecule involved in ieb barrier protection via increasing both cytokeratin  <dig> and cytokeratin  <dig> proteins expression  <cit> , whose mrna expression were induced by egc in iec in our study. in this context, knowledge of genes modulated by egc could direct future efforts aimed at identifying novel glial mediators involved in egc control of ieb functions. our data also further suggest that egc differentially regulate some ieb functions as compared to fibroblasts, although comparison has only been performed on a limited set of genes and one cannot fully rule out that species differences could also be involved . however, these differences are consistent with the observation that while egc have anti-proliferative effects on both human and rat iec  <cit> , fibroblasts increase iec proliferation  <cit> .

collectively, our data support the concept that egc play a key protective role upon ieb homeostasis by reinforcing global barrier functions. additionally, our study reinforces data suggesting that enteric glia lesions and/or functional defects could be involved in the development of pathologies with altered barrier  and also be associated with increased barrier susceptibility to pathogen aggression.
