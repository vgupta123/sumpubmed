BACKGROUND
tetrahymena thermophila is a well studied model organism for molecular and cellular biology. telomerase, self-splicing rna, and the function of histone acetylation are some of the major discoveries made with this unicellular ciliated protozoan . it was also the first member of the phylum ciliophora to have its complete somatic  genome sequenced  <cit> . like other ciliates, t. thermophila's mac genome is a highly processed version of the germline  genome, which is transcriptionally silent and responsible for direct transmission of genetic material to future sexual generations  <cit> . the transcriptionally active, amplified mac genome consists of an estimated 180â€“ <dig> chromosomes ranging from  <dig> kb to over  <dig> mb long, collectively about  <dig> mb. purified mac genomic dna  was sequenced by the whole genome shotgun method to 9x coverage and assembled into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig> scaffolds that appear to represent a highly accurate and complete draft genome sequence  <cit> .

here we report significant progress toward genome finishing. since the initial shotgun assembly, finishing efforts have succeeded in closing numerous sequencing and physical gaps. in addition, mic/mac comparative genomic hybridization  has identified  <dig> small scaffolds as probable mic dna contaminants. together, these results reduce the number of mac contigs and scaffolds to  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, and provide a greatly improved sequence assembly and foundation for structural gene annotation. our closure efforts also confirm the low repetitiveness of the mac genome and the absence of sequences highly related to invasive dna elements  <cit> . these features make complete closure of this assembly feasible.

we also report here on improvements in t. thermophila genome annotation, which has presented certain challenges. first, comparative genomic data are extremely limited; although the mac genome sequence and preliminary annotation of another ciliate, paramecium tetraurelia, have also been released  <cit> , these two organisms are only distantly related  <cit>  . in addition, tetrahymena, like many ciliates  <cit> , uses an alternative genetic code, in which uga is the only stop codon and uaa and uag encode glutamine  <cit> , resulting in longer potential open reading frames in genomic sequence. preliminary gene finding algorithms were trained using a small collection of t. thermophila cdna sequences, supplemented with data from the genome sequence of the most closely related organism available at that time, the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum  <cit> . this ab initio gene prediction resulted in  <dig>  putative protein-coding genes  <cit> , over four times more than the most commonly studied unicellular eukaryotic model organism, saccharomyces cerevisiae , and even more than many metazoans  <cit> . this high gene estimate is consistent with analyses of t. thermophila mrna complexity  <cit>  and with the even higher gene number prediction from p. tetraurelia  <cit> . we have sought additional direct evidence to refine the gene number estimate and gene structure predictions.

a powerful tool for structural gene annotation and expression profiling is the analysis of expressed sequence tags , single-pass sequencing reads of cdna clones  <cit> . over  <dig> million ests have been deposited into the national center for biotechnology information  dbest public database . mapping of ests to an existing genome sequence by spliced alignment has allowed substantial refinement of gene models in a number of eukaryotic organisms . besides providing a measure of direct confirmation of gene structure for those genes "hit" by an est, the additional sequences of confirmed introns, and in some cases polya-addition sites, provide better training data for gene finding algorithms to locate genes with low or specialized expression patterns that are not found as abundantly in the cdna libraries used. extensive est sequencing is also effective in identifying alternatively spliced mrna isoforms, the prediction of which by ab initio methods is in its early development  <cit>  and has not been reported in protozoans.

preliminary analyses of existing t. thermophila ests indicated that the ab initio predicted gene identifications are relatively robust  <cit> . however, a significant fraction of gene models appears to be flawed by, for example, incorrect splice site placement, missing exons, or improper merging or splitting of adjacent coding regions. also, the cdna libraries sampled represented only two physiological states, log phase growth in rich medium and sexual conjugation. therefore, to improve structural gene annotation as well as to investigate gene expression under a wider variety of environmental and developmental conditions, we undertook a more extensive t. thermophila est project.

cdna libraries were constructed from cells treated under six different conditions that reflect key life cycle events as well as common interests of the tetrahymena research community , including several growth conditions, starvation, and conjugation. together with those previously reported  <cit> , we have now generated  <dig>  est reads with valid alignments to the non-rdna mac genome assembly and examined them for patterns of condition-specific gene expression. analysis of these ests provides direct evidence that over 40% of the ab initio predicted genes are indeed transcribed into mrna and has allowed extensive refinement of the gene models, as described below. alternative splicing appears to be rare in tetrahymena, as also reported for paramecium  <cit> . these refinements will significantly enhance the efficacy of transcriptome analysis and whole genome data mining. the revised protein-coding gene number estimate is  <dig> .

methods
comparative genomic hybridization microarray design
a t. thermophila microarray design  was developed in collaboration with nimblegen to, as evenly as possible, cover the tigr november  <dig> mac genome sequence assembly . the array consists of  <dig>  uniformly spaced approximately 60-mer isothermal probes. mean probe start-to-start distance spacing is  <dig> bp; median is  <dig> bp. to avoid excessively repeated sequence or long homopolymer blocks , individual probe spacing varies between  <dig> and  <dig>  bp. probes were designed for  <dig> of the  <dig> scaffolds. three scaffolds  were excluded because they represent the rdna mac chromosome, and three small scaffolds  did not allow probe design because of high sequence repetition. altogether the probes cover approximately one quarter of the entire assembled mac genome sequence. to simplify the graphic display, nimblegen reported the genomic probe positions and values for the  <dig> individual scaffolds larger than  <dig> kb, encompassing  <dig>  mb. the remaining  <dig> scaffolds were reported as a concatenate; individual scaffold names and corresponding probe positions and scanned values were obtained using a list of scaffold starts supplied with the microarray design.

genomic dna preparation for cgh
cells obtained from four independent thawings of frozen t. thermophila strain sb <dig>  the sequenced strain  <cit> , were used as sources of purified mic and mac dna. cultures were independently grown as described  <cit> . mac dna was purified from three thaws and mic dna was purified from two thaws as described  <cit> . southern blots of ecori-digested dna preparations were probed with a region of the histone h <dig> gene containing mac-destined and mic-limited sequences  <cit>  to verify minimal mic and mac dna cross-contamination.

dna labeling, two-color hybridization, scanning, and data normalization
one of the purified mac dna preparation was chosen as the reference dna for all the microarray hybridizations. the other two mac preps and the two mic preps were the sample dnas. one of the mic preps was used for two separate hybridizations, labelled mic_ <dig> and mic_ <dig> in additional file 1: normalized mic and mac array hybridization ratios. dna labeling and hybridizations were performed as previously described  <cit> . for fluorescence intensity measurements, tiff images were extracted using nimblescan  <dig> software, nimblegen system's image quantification and data analysis package. grids were placed on each image and the quantification area for each feature was adjusted for optimal placement. after combining the signal intensity information with the genomic coordinate information, the cy <dig> and cy <dig> signal intensities were normalized to one another using "qspline normalization"  <cit> .

microarray data analysis
for each microarray, we started with the nimblegen-supplied file of normalized log <dig> ratios of sample:reference fluorescence measurements at every probe location. normalized ratios were used to make more meaningful comparisons between different microarrays. for the two mac-hybridized microarrays, the two scaffold ratios were simply averaged for each scaffold. to average the three mic-hybridized microarrays, we did not take their simple average, as this would have given undue weight to the dna prep used in two  microarrays . instead, for every scaffold, the scaffold-wide ratios in the duplicate microarrays were first averaged; the resulting value was then averaged with the value for the microarray hybridized with the second mic prep dna.

transposon families in t. thermophila have been experimentally shown to be mic-limited  <cit> . scaffolds containing such known mic limited sequences were identified using t. thermophila transposon genes available at genbank. these are repetitive sequences and thus more likely present as contaminants of the mac genome sequence assemblies. the nucleotide sequence of the t. thermophila mac genome was searched by tblastn using the inferred peptide sequence of these genes as the queries and an expect value  limit of  <dig> . for every scaffold, the hit with the lowest e value was used for further analysis.

gap closure
most gaps and low coverage areas were sequenced by "primer walking" using custom primers on small to medium insert  clones from the shotgun libraries  <cit> . remaining areas were finished with custom primers on pcr products amplified from shotgun clones or genomic dna. repeat areas were resolved by producing transposon-mediated mini-libraries  on shotgun clones spanning each repeat. in areas where the repeat was too large to be spanned by a single clone, a tiling path of clones was selected and each was transposon-tagged and assembled separately. all finishing assembly was done using the tigr assembler . to satisfy closure criteria, each base of finished sequence must be spanned by two clones or pcr products, and each base must have two underlying reads of high quality sequence. areas where these criteria are not met are noted as exceptions.

cdna library construction and est sequencing
a summary of cdna libraries and est sequencing is presented in table  <dig>  libraries ttb, ttc, ttd , and tte  were constructed and sequenced as previously described  <cit> . all other libraries were constructed by amplicon express  from either cells preserved in rnalater  or total rna prepared using trizol. all cell incubations were at 30Â°c. for the fco library , equal aliquots of cells were harvested from a mating between strains cu <dig> and cu <dig>  at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h after mixing. for all other conditions, strain sb <dig> was used. for the starvation library , rna was prepared from cells harvested after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig> h in  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig>  starvation buffer. for the heavy metal library , cells were grown to mid-log phase in neff medium  <cit> , and separate equal aliquots were treated with  <dig> Î¼m cdcl <dig> or  <dig> Î¼m cuso <dig> for  <dig> h. for the minimal medium library , cells were grown to mid-log phase in minimal defined medium  <cit> . for the tsa library , cells were grown for  <dig> h  in rich medium plus  <dig> nm trichostatin a. at this concentration, histone deacetylase activity is significantly inhibited , but doubling time is only increased about 20% over control mock-treated cultures .

tt <dig> and tts cdnas were cloned directionally into the ecori  and xhoi  sites of pbluescriptiisk+  and sequenced using t <dig>  and t <dig>  primers. libraries fco, fmm, and fts were constructed using smart technology and cloned into pdnr-lib  using sfiia  for the 5' end, and sfiib  for the 3' end. m <dig> forward primer was used for 5' sequencing. all reads containing the letters tf, tg, or th in the suffix of their read ids are from the 5' direction. all those containing to, tv, t1v, or t <dig> are from the 3' direction.

reverse transcriptase-pcr
total rna was isolated using trizol reagent  from vegetatively growing t. thermophila strain sb <dig> and treated with dnasei  for  <dig> min at 37Â°c. cdna was synthesized from  <dig> ug of total rna using superscriptii reverse transcriptase  and reverse primers. pcr was performed using 1/ <dig> of resulting cdna with forward and reverse primers flanking the splice sites in question and taq polymerase, with  <dig> cycles of 94Â°c for  <dig> sec, 56Â°c for  <dig> sec, and 72Â°c for  <dig> sec.

est alignment and assembly
sequences were trimmed for low quality regions, vector contamination, and poly-a tails using seqclean  and the univec database . in addition, contaminating rrna sequences were removed from the data set by screening against the published rdna sequence  <cit>  using the program to assemble spliced alignments   <cit> . the remaining est sequences entered the pasa pipeline and were aligned against the most complete genome sequence  using blat, sim <dig> and geneseqer, as previously described  <cit> . alignments were validated by strict criteria, requiring gt/ag consensus donor/acceptor splice junctions and at least 95% sequence identity over at least 90% of the sequence length. ests aligning to the genome with putative introns less than  <dig> bp or greater than  <dig>  bp in length were excluded .

gene model refinement
since the preliminary gene annotation  <cit> , an interim release of gene models was made available on the tetrahymena thermophila genome project ftp site  on 8/31/ <dig>  both that reannotation and the currently reported gene model refinement made extensive use of evidencemodeler , an automated tool that reports eukaryotic gene structures as a consensus of all available evidence, weighted according to the form of evidence  <cit> . in tetrahymena, est alignment by pasa was given the highest weight, followed by similarity of predicted peptide sequences to sequences of other organisms, then ab initio gene predictions. gene ontology  terms were attributed to gene products with pfam domains having scores above the specific trusted cutoff .

RESULTS
determining the nuclear source  of every scaffold
our shotgun sequencing libraries  <cit>  were constructed from dna of macronuclei purified by standard differential centrifugation methods  <cit>  that do not wholly eliminate mic contamination. we are aware that minor mic dna contamination of the whole genome assembly occurred, but the exact extent of contamination was unknown. building a clean database of only mac scaffolds would greatly facilitate physical mapping  <cit>  and genome finishing, and would also be useful for annotation and for understanding how the mac genome is formed from its mic precursor. the mic genome is estimated to be approximately 15% larger than that of the mac, much of the extra dna being repetitive  <cit> . mic-limited dna is found dispersed throughout the mic genome at as many as  <dig>  internally eliminated sequence  sites  <cit> . these iess are removed through an epigenetically controlled whole genome rearrangement process that occurs during the sexual conjugation pathway  <cit> . our preliminary analysis  <cit>  supported the idea that this ies removal acts as a genome defense against invasive dna elements and not as a barrier against repetitive dna per se, as in repeat-induced point mutation in neurospora  <cit> . the results presented below provide further support that sequences highly related to invasive transposons are found exclusively, or nearly so, in the mic.

because of limited sequence coverage of the mic contaminating dna, it was assembled into only small scaffolds. in the initial november  <dig> whole genome assembly, scaffolds smaller than  <dig>  kb account for two thirds  of all scaffolds, but only  <dig> % of the assembled sequence. analyses of transposon-related sequences, including known mic-limited t. thermophila transposons  <cit> , showed that the great majority match to very small scaffolds  <cit> . happy mapping  provides independent evidence that small scaffolds are enriched for mic-limited dna . all underrepresented markers in the happy mapping panel  were located on scaffolds <  <dig>  kb in length. indeed, at least 40% of those scaffolds match known t. thermophila mic-limited sequences  <cit> .

to identify mic dna-containing scaffolds, we used array-based comparative genomic hybridization  to measure mic-specific to mac-reference hybridization intensities of nearly all scaffolds. we designed a microarray with more than  <dig>  unique probes that together cover about 25% of the entire genome assembly . to this microarray we hybridized three purified mic and two purified mac dna samples  isolated from independent cultures of strain sb <dig>  a third mac dna preparation was used as the reference dna in each of these two-color hybridizations.

purification of mic or mac dna is based on physical separation of nuclei and is not complete, although, because of higher mac ploidy, mac dna preparations are purer. still, purified mic dna is greatly enriched for mic-limited dna sequences relative to purified mac dna . the fluorescence intensities were expressed as the normalized log <dig> ratios of sample:reference dna hybridizations. a ratio was determined for each scaffold by averaging the log <dig> ratios obtained at every probe position on a given scaffold . mic ratios were separately obtained for each scaffold for each of the three mic dna-hybridized arrays and averaged, as described in methods; the same was done for the two mac dna-hybridized arrays. the scaffold ratio for each individual hybridization and the average mic and mac ratios are included in additional file 1: normalized mic and mac array hybridization ratios.

the numerical distribution of scaffolds by mic ratio is shown in figure 1a. most scaffolds are found in a large peak at a log <dig> ratio near  <dig> , as expected for mac-destined dna . to further validate that this peak represents mac-destined scaffolds, mic ratios were plotted as a function of scaffold length . the largest scaffolds showed a uniform depth of coverage in the shotgun sequencing project  and are thus clearly composed of mac-destined dna. as expected, the largest scaffold data points hover near the 1: <dig> hybridization ratio .

a red line has been drawn in figure 1a at a log <dig> ratio of  <dig> , the location where the tail of the mac-destined dna peak ceases to decrease. to our best current approximation, a log <dig> ratio higher than  <dig>  indicates the corresponding scaffold is mic-limited. ratios higher than  <dig>  are diffusely distributed, varying up to a log <dig> mic: mac hybridization intensity ratio of  <dig>  . factors that may account for this diffuseness include the documented copy number variation of mic-specific elements  <cit> , cross-hybridization between mic-specific elements and repetitive mac-retained sequences , and intrinsic probe hybridization variability exacerbated by the small size of these scaffolds and thus the small number of array probes in each of them.

to further support our conclusions based on comparative hybridization, we identified scaffolds that match known mic-limited t. thermophila transposon genes .  <dig> scaffolds that matched such genes with e values less than  <dig> e- <dig> were found. all but two are small scaffolds  and fall above the  <dig>  value for the averaged mic:mac log <dig> ratio , providing strong validation of the array approach to identify mic limited sequence. the two exceptions  fall well below the e value upper boundary . since the stringency of the match is so high but the scaffolds are clearly in general mac-destined, we suspect that these two exceptions represent rare cases where the celera assembler co-assembled mac-destined and contaminating, high copy number mic-limited sequence . we have seen another rare example of mic:mac dna co-assembly: chromosome breakage sequence cbs4r- <dig>  which is mic-limited, was assembled at one end of scaffold ch <dig> .

as the stringency of transposon matches decrease , there is a dramatic increase in the number of matches to large scaffolds that, by the cgh criterion, are clearly mac-destined . co-assembly of mac-destined and mic-limited dna remains a possible explanation for some of these hits. alternatively, some transposon copies, or segments thereof, may have become permanently mac-destined. this may happen with evolutionary time, as their sequences degrade to the point that they can no longer be recognized by the scnrnas that guide ies removal  <cit> , even if transposon sequence-relatedness is still detectable by blast search. as an intermediate stage in this trajectory, such segments may still be generally mic-limited but failed to be removed during the differentiation of the mac in the particular cell line that was sequenced. better understanding of these possibilities can be gained once the mic genome sequence becomes available and by comparison of multiple independently derived mac genomes.

to summarize, the vast majority of mic-limited scaffolds are in all likelihood correctly identified. for most of the scaffolds, the identification remains statistical in nature and there is some possibility that a few scaffolds near the threshold have been misclassified. together, the  <dig> mic-limited scaffolds identified here represent about  <dig> % of the prior assembled genome sequence and about 8% of the total estimated mic-limited sequence . after removal of the  <dig> mic-limited scaffolds and other closure efforts , the complete span of t. thermophila scaffolds is  <dig> , <dig> bp, a decrease of  <dig> , <dig> bp from the previously published figure  <cit> .

targeted gap closure
multiple, independent lines of evidence indicate that the published whole genome assembly is of high quality and completeness  <cit> , but, as with all draft genome sequences, many gaps remain. because these gaps contain or interrupt an unknown number of genes, their closure helps to obtain as complete a gene annotation as possible. additional benefits of closure include placement of genes in a more extended chromosomal context and the correlation of physical and genetic maps, both for the mac and ultimately the complete mic genome. closure of the tetrahymena mac genome is somewhat complicated by the presence of as many as  <dig> or more chromosomes, but made simpler by the low levels of repetitive sequence.

initial assembly of bulk  mac shotgun sequence reads using the celera assembler  <cit>  generated  <dig>  scaffolds, composed of  <dig>  contigs  <cit> . following the cgh analysis reported above, the number of mac-derived scaffolds can be reduced to  <dig> . of these,  <dig> scaffolds are capped with telomeric repeats at both ends and thus represent complete mac chromosomes. an additional  <dig> scaffolds are capped with telomeres at one end. remaining gaps can be divided into two types: sequencing gaps and physical gaps. sequencing gaps occur between the contigs of a scaffold and result from no, low, or poor quality sequence coverage of regions that are, nevertheless, contained in known clones from one of the genomic dna sequencing libraries. therefore they can generally be closed by methods such as primer walking. physical gaps separate scaffolds and can occur stochastically or result from the absence of sequence from regions that are underrepresented because of incompatibility with e. coli cloning, or repetitive sequence regions that cannot be unambiguously resolved by the celera assembler. by visual inspection and resolution of such terminal repetitive regions, a number of scaffolds were linked into an additional  <dig> complete chromosomes, as shown in additional file  <dig> , and the lengths of four single telomere-capped scaffolds were extended.

tetrahymena closure efforts focused first on finishing to high standards of quality the largest scaffolds that are capped by telomeres at both ends, i.e. full chromosomes with no physical gaps. additional file 2a lists  <dig> chromosomes that are now completely finished, comprising  <dig> , <dig> bp of sequence, approximately 53% of the estimated full genome length. because we did not preselect "trouble-free" sequencing gaps, our success with this unbiased approach supports the idea that highly repetitive regions will not present a serious challenge to complete closure of sequencing and perhaps physical gaps.

substantial progress was made in closing an additional seven complete chromosomes, which are listed in additional file 2c as "complete chromosomes, with exceptions". the exceptions represent small regions that do not meet our quality control standards . six of these regions, ranging in length from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, are covered by only a single clone, sequence, or high quality sequence. four other regions, estimated at between  <dig> and  <dig> bp, have no sequence coverage. these gaps are represented as a corresponding number of unknown bases  in the assembled sequences. in two cases, sequence up to the telomeric repeats has not been determined, although the close proximity of telomeres has been confirmed by pcr. these seven nearly finished chromosomes comprise approximately  <dig>  mb of additional sequence. in addition to the complete chromosomes, progress was made on closure of four large, single telomere-capped scaffolds. additional files 2b and 2d list, respectively, three fully closed single-capped scaffolds and one "single-capped scaffold, with exception", which has a single sequencing gap of approximately  <dig> bp. together, these comprise approximately  <dig>  mb.

following closure, approximately 60% of the tetrahymena mac genome is now completely finished, or finished with minor exceptions in coverage or small gaps. of an estimated  <dig> sequencing gaps in the initial celera assembly,  <dig> have been closed, in addition to  <dig> physical gaps. six of the linkages by which scaffolds were extended have been independently confirmed by published happy mapping links  <cit> , and others have been confirmed by unpublished happy results .

est sequencing and analysis
previously reported est sequencing efforts  <cit>  were confined to two cell conditions â€“ log phase growth in rich medium and conjugation. to sample a wider variety of ests, cdna libraries were constructed and sequenced from these as well as several other conditions . tetrahymena grows rapidly in simple rich medium , with a doubling time of approximately two to three hours  <cit> , but can also be grown in simple chemically defined medium that includes a number of amino acids, nucleosides, salts and vitamins  <cit> . log phase cells grown in both rich and minimal media were used for library construction, as well as log phase cells in rich medium plus heavy metals, which induce expression of metallothioneins and other stress proteins  <cit> , or the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin a, which is known in other organisms to activate certain genes by causing hyperacetylation of chromatin  <cit> .

in addition, two cdna libraries were constructed from mrna collected at various time points of conjugation and starvation. the sexual conjugation pathway of tetrahymena has been extensively studied  <cit> , in large part because it is during this period that the genome-wide dna rearrangements that shape the macronuclear genome occur  <cit> . conjugation is an inducible process that, under ideal conditions, can be highly synchronous in large populations  <cit> . a number of genes have been identified  that are expressed solely or predominantly during conjugation . cell cultures are prepared to initiate conjugation by starvation in very dilute buffer , a treatment that also induces morphological alteration to a "fast swimmer" cell shape  <cit> , changes in chromatin structure  <cit>  and histone modification  <cit> , and general and specific changes in mrna abundance  <cit> .

a total of  <dig>  successful est reads were obtained from the nine cdna libraries listed in table  <dig>  representing the six different cell conditions described above. the sequences were trimmed for vector contamination and low quality regions as described in methods. all ests were submitted to the ncbi dbest public database , as well as to the taxonomically broad est database , an est repository focused on protists. over  <dig>  sequences that align to the rdna locus  <cit>  were removed from the pool, and all remaining ests were aligned to the whole genome assembly using pasa  <cit> . after removing sequences that failed alignment and splice site validation criteria ,  <dig>  ests that align to bulk  mac chromosomes remained. by visual inspection, we excluded an additional  <dig>  ests from the set used for reannotation purposes because of inconsistencies  with other strongly supported gene model evidence , leaving  <dig>  ests , which were used for all subsequent analyses. sequences of the  <dig>  validated ests are available for download at .

in addition to contamination by rrna, ests that failed to align with the bulk mac genome assembly could possibly originate from transcripts of dna regions not contained in the assembly, namely sequences located in assembly gaps, mic-limited dna, and the two or more chromosomes known to be lost during early vegetative growth following conjugation  <cit> . it has been repeatedly reported  <cit>  that, at least during vegetative growth, there is no detectable expression of the mic genome. during conjugation, non-genic, bidirectional transcription of germline-limited dna occurs  <cit> , but there is no evidence such transcripts are poly-adenylated , and thus, they should be underrepresented in our polya-selected cdna libraries. none of our ests aligned to the  <dig> scaffolds identified, as described above, as mic contaminants, which account for an estimated 8% of mic-specific sequences. we also examined the ests that failed our strict alignment criteria. the vast majority of ests derived from genome regions not represented in our assembly would be expected to fail both alignment criteria of greater than 90% identity over greater than 95% total sequence length, but none of our est reads did. most alignment failures appear to be the result of chimeric inserts. thus, we have not detected any evidence for transcription of germline-limited dna, chromosomes lost during early vegetative growth, or unidentified genes found in unsequenced assembly gaps.

the principal purpose of this est sequencing project was to gain experimental evidence on the structure of as many genes as possible; therefore we analyzed the ests in batches as they were generated to search for signs of redundancy in the libraries and adjust the proportion of reads obtained from each. compatible overlapping est sequences  that met all alignment criteria were clustered using pasa into  <dig>  clusters . overall, 49% of these clusters were singletons and only 9% were represented by greater than ten est reads. these results indicate that the libraries were far from being saturated and that further sampling would generate additional data concerning gene expression. the pasa clusters mapped to a total of  <dig>  predicted genes. in  <dig>  cases, just one pasa cluster mapped to each predicted gene, but between two and eight pasa clusters mapped to the remaining  <dig>  predicted genes to which any ests were mapped . most of these cases are the result of nonoverlap between the clusters, which is not surprising, given the fragmentary nature of est evidence and that many clones were sequenced from both the 5' and 3' directions. some of these nonoverlap cases may represent incorrect gene predictions that should be split into two adjacent genes. however, in the absence of confirmatory evidence, e.g. full-length cdna sequence or reliable comparative genomic data, we did not update gene annotations by splitting any gene models.

in contrast, pasa reported  <dig> cases of overlapping, but incompatible, sets of between two and five assemblies that represent potential examples of alternative splicing within protein-coding regions. alternative splicing within predicted mrna untranslated regions, which was previously reported in one t. thermophila gene  <cit>  using the same set of est evidence described here, was not examined in this study. there has been only one published report of alternative splicing in tetrahymena affecting a predicted open reading frame  <cit> . each of the  <dig> putative new examples was visually inspected. most alternate assemblies consisted of only a single est in which one or more introns was unremoved; inadvertent cdna cloning of immature mrnas is a potential explanation for these isolated examples. in a number of other cases, a single est showed evidence for usage of an alternative splice junction, resulting in either in-frame insertion or deletion of between one and seven codons, alternative start codon usage, or frame shift. although such outcomes might be programmed, the supporting evidence of only a single est suggests they may instead represent rare splicing errors. that the coding potential outcomes were generally either minor  or drastic  tends to support this view, although additional evidence is necessary to reach a final conclusion.

stronger evidence for alternative splicing was found in ten cases, summarized in additional file 4: putative cases of alternative splicing. in these cases, the alternate assembly consists of between two and eight ests from independent cdna clones. six of the ten cases represent alternate intron removal or retention; the other four represent alternate splice junction usage . the consequences of such putative alternative splicing events on coding potential include insertion or deletion of between  <dig> and  <dig> codons, and limited-range n- or c-terminal frame shifts. to confirm these alternative splices, we performed rt-pcr on vegetative cell rna. we successfully obtained amplification products for eight of the genes in question , and, in each case, the alternative splices were confirmed . in addition, for the four cases of alternate splice junction usage, another amplification product corresponding to unspliced mrna was detected.

we conclude from this analysis that alternative splicing is uncommon in t. thermophila, at least under the growth conditions we have examined, as has also been observed in p. tetraurelia  <cit> . alternative splicing has been posited as a means of encoding more information in the genomes of complex metazoans, such as humans, that have only marginally higher protein-coding gene counts than tetrahymena. recent studies  <cit>  suggest most alternatively spliced human transcripts may not encode functional protein products, and that these alternate transcripts may simply be tolerated but provide potential for rapid evolutionary changes. it remains to be seen whether the apparent rarity of alternative splicing in ciliates is directly related to their relatively high gene count and, if so, by what mechanism.

improvements to structural annotation
despite many advancements, automated gene finding in eukaryotic genomes remains a challenge  <cit> . in the case of tetrahymena, the lack of substantial comparative sequence data from near relatives and/or est data led us to the use of ab initio methods that, while sufficient for a general analysis of genome contents  <cit> , do not provide gene models of satisfactory quality for a widely studied model organism. with the est evidence here reported, many automated updates were made using the tools described below, but assessment of multiple forms of evidence still required manual intervention in many cases.

initial gene finding was done using tigrscan  <cit>  and custom parameters to generate  <dig>  protein-coding gene models  <cit> . for this study, gene finding was repeated using the programs genezilla , glimmerhmm  <cit> , and augustus  <cit> ; genezilla was the most sensitive of these and also performed with high accuracy, on the basis of accumulated est evidence. as more est sequences became available, as well as the genome sequence of p. tetraurelia  <cit> , we used evidencemodeler   <cit>  to generate consensus gene models from an automated weighted evaluation of the various independent pieces of structural evidence. est evidence was by far the most valuable source of data to improve the gene models and increase sensitivity. many models were short; as a conservative cutoff, we eliminated  <dig>  models with a predicted coding length of less than  <dig> amino acids.

in addition to using automated methods,  <dig> gene models were manually curated by proceeding from end to end of the largest scaffolds. an additional  <dig> gene models that lacked an atg start codon were examined and corrected. gene models for which est sequence alignment was problematic  were visually inspected, resulting in some cases in gene model mergers and/or refinements. in some cases, updates to the gene models implemented by evm, which relies heavily on pasa gene model predictions, caused spurious consequences. ests may be successfully mapped to a location on the genome assembly, but, in the absence of a polya-tail to orient the direction of transcription, the pasa algorithm will simply look for the longest single exon orf on either strand to make this determination. usually, this longest orf is on the correct strand and corresponds to the gene model predicted by gene finding algorithms, but occasionally it is on the opposite strand, and an erroneous gene model overlapping the original is automatically generated. such cases were reviewed and manually corrected. we also incorporated published annotation corrections based on proteomic evidence  <cit> .

following these automated and manual structural curation steps, our latest estimate of protein-coding genes in the t. thermophila genome is  <dig> . these gene models have been submitted to genbank and are available on the project's ftp site  and from the tetrahymena genome database . overall features of the gene models are similar to those reported previously . 71% of gene models contain at least one intron, with an average length of  <dig> nucleotides. the revised average number of introns per gene is  <dig> .

because of the numerous gene model updates, both manual and automated, performed over an extended time period, including 5' and 3' extensions, splicing changes, frame shifts, and mergers, it is difficult to fully characterize the nature and degree to which the gene models have been altered as a whole from the first published set  <cit>  to the present. nevertheless, to make an estimate, we performed a blastp search of each of the updated predicted peptide sequences  against the preliminary set  to find the highest scoring match . the full results are presented in additional file 5: blastp comparison of current vs. preliminary gene models. most of the updated gene models  match the preliminary models completely. an additional 14% of the updated gene models have best matches to preliminary models with genbank ids that are either identical or numerically adjacent . these updated models differ from their corresponding preliminary models to varying degrees in length  and/or amino acid sequence .  <dig> models have no significant match  among the preliminary set, but it is notable that these include an atypically high number of shorter peptide sequences , and that all but  <dig> of these  <dig> models are annotated only as "hypothetical proteins", suggesting the presence of spurious predictions among them. the remaining 1% of the updated models have a best match to a preliminary model with a non-adjacent genbank id , indicating that the original models have undergone substantial structural modifications.

selenocysteine-containing genes
as reported previously  <cit> , t. thermophila expresses a trna predicted to decode the only tetrahymena stop codon, uga, into selenocysteine . sec, the so-called 21st amino acid, is found in all three domains of life, often at the active site of certain redox enzymes  <cit> . in eukaryotes, translation of uga to sec depends on the presence of a conserved secondary structure, known as the selenocysteine insertion sequence , in the 3' untranslated region of the mrna  <cit> . because uga is only rarely translated as an amino acid codon, standard gene prediction programs cannot accurately annotate selenoproteins.

we searched the genome and predicted proteome of t. thermophila for homologs of known sec-containing proteins from humans  <cit> , drosophila  <cit> , chlamydomonas  <cit> , c. elegans  <cit> , p. falciparum  <cit> , and emiliania huxleyi  <cit>  using blastp against predicted tetrahymena proteins and tblastn against the whole genome assembly. no significant matches were detected for a number of the query proteins, including the four plasmodium proteins, which are so far confined to the apicomplexans. two of these four have been predicted to be targeted to the apicoplast  <cit> , an organelle for which we and others have failed to find evidence within the ciliate lineage  <cit> .

meaningful alignments in the regions of known sec residues from other organisms were examined manually for signs of misannotation of exon/intron boundaries and/or stop sites that might have resulted from an unrecognized in-frame uga. six cases of putative t. thermophila selenoprotein-encoding genes were identified . in the course of inspection, structural annotation of three other genes was manually improved in the region of interest without involving a putative sec codon . based on this evidence, the structural annotation of these nine genes was updated in the most recent genbank submission. the six predicted putative selenoproteins include two glutathione peroxidases , three members of the thioredoxin reductase  family, and one homolog of selenophosphate synthetase  <dig>  the first two enzyme families are associated with cellular defense against oxidative stress and, not surprisingly, tetrahymena ests from nearly all genes in these families are found disproportionately in libraries produced from stressed cells, in particular starved and heavy metal-treated cells . the putative selenoprotein-encoding gene ttherm_ <dig> is an exception to this trend, with ests being abundantly represented in vegetatively growing cells, suggestive of a role in non-stress cell metabolism.

the predicted 3' utr sequence of each tetrahymena homolog of a selenoprotein from the species described above was tested for the presence of a secis using secisearch  <cit> . the six putative selenoproteins, and only those six, were positive . it is quite possible that t. thermophila contains other selenoproteins, not readily detectable as homologs of known selenoproteins in other organisms, that may be detected by a more systematic search for secis elements downstream of predicted genes . additional comparative genomic information from related tetrahymena species will aid in the verification of such candidates.

condition-specific est representation
we examined the frequencies at which genes were hit by ests from each of the six conditions as potential signs of differential gene expression. additional file  <dig> is an excel spreadsheet of all  <dig>  predicted protein-coding genes hit by one or more est, with the number of est hits broken down by cell condition. generally, genes predicted to be highly expressed in a given condition were indeed found to be over-represented among the ests from that condition. for example, the top gene in conjugation est abundance is ngoa, an apparently non-protein-coding gene of unknown function that is also induced during starvation  <cit> . two of the next three  are twi <dig> and pdd <dig>  both implicated in conjugation-specific genome rearrangement  <cit> . pdd <dig> encodes a chromodomain protein that acts through binding of lysine-methylated histone h <dig>  <cit> . another uncharacterized chromodomain protein-encoding gene is among the top conjugation ests, as well as a gene encoding a protein containing a jmjc domain, which has recently been implicated in the demethylation of histones  <cit> . methylation of histone lysine residues is carried out by set domain-containing proteins  <cit> , and several genes encoding these are over-represented by conjugation ests. these examples, as well as numerous genes annotated as "hypothetical" found to be differentially represented among the conjugation est set, are promising candidates for experimental analysis, using the tools of tetrahymena reverse genetics  <cit> .

all five metallothionein genes  <cit>  are among the ests found predominantly in the heavy metal cdna library, as are other genes with potential roles in response to oxidative stress . a number of the genes over-represented among starvation ests encode proteases and proteasome subunits, which may be required for scavenging nutrients from both extracellular and intracellular sources  <cit> . a more quantitative assessment of genome-wide differential gene expression will be facilitated by interrogations of whole genome expression microarrays, which are in progress .

the overlaps between genes represented in the est pools are displayed in the venn diagrams of figure  <dig>  figure 3a shows the overlap between the four log phase, vegetative growth conditions . as the diagram reveals, there is considerable diversity in the est representations. the four most numerically abundant gene subsets are those unique to each of the four conditions while only  <dig> predicted genes are hit by one or more est in all four conditions. however, much of the apparent lack of overlap is due to undersampling of the est libraries. of the  <dig>  genes hit only by ests from a unique growth condition, 80% were hit by only a single est, and only 5% were hit by four or more. in figure 3b, the four vegetative conditions are lumped together and compared for overlap with the conjugation and starvation conditions. again, the three most abundant subsets are those unique to each of the conditions. of the  <dig>  genes in these unique subsets, 54% are represented by only a single est, while only 14% are represented by four or more.

CONCLUSIONS
we report here substantial progress in finishing and reannotating the mac genome sequence of tetrahymena thermophila. these results represent the culmination of the concerted effort begun in  <dig>  additional refinement of these genomic resources, as described below, is highly desirable and will be sought in the near future, but the current picture is greatly enhanced relative to our first report  <cit> . over 60% of the genome is essentially finished, and the vast majority of mic contamination has been removed from the assembly. to this point in the finishing phase, no exceptional difficulties have been encountered in closing sequencing gaps due to, e.g., complex repetitive regions. in addition, all physical gaps examined thus far have been small . ongoing happy mapping has now linked over 97% of the mac genome into super-scaffolds. we therefore predict that, with a limited additional closure effort in targeted regions, the entire t. thermophila mac genome sequence can be finished, which would be a remarkable achievement for a genome of this size. the updated mac genome sequence presented here will be a powerful tool for understanding eukaryotic chromosome structure, and an indispensable guide for the assembly of the germline mic genome , which will be a greater challenge due to its abundance of repetitive sequences.

by a combination of est sequencing and analysis, improved gene finding, and manual curation, we have addressed many of the shortcomings of the initial t. thermophila structural annotation. in addition, we have gained new insights into tetrahymena biology through the detection of alternative splice sites previously unknown in this genome, the identification of selenoprotein-encoding genes, and the analysis of patterns of differential est abundance. the updated set of  <dig>  gene models will provide a new framework for conducting and interpreting tetrahymena genomic and post-genomic research, as well as for comparative genomic studies involving the ciliates. further improvements to structural annotation  will benefit greatly from the comparison of sequences conserved between t. thermophila and related species within the tetrahymena genus and from generation of full-length cdna sequences.
