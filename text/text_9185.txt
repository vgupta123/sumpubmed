BACKGROUND
heavy metal pollution is an increasing environmental problem affecting human health. among the heavy metal pollutants, cadmium  has become one of the most toxic heavy metals to animals and plants owing to its high mobility and toxicity. long-term low-level cd exposure causes a variety of serious health risks, including emphysema, bone damage , cancer, cardiovascular disease, and irreversible chronic renal failure . the burden of cd on the body depends mostly on the dietary intake of plant-derived foods  <cit>  because plants accumulate cd in the edible parts. the roots uptake the element from cd-contaminated soils and it is subsequently transported from roots to shoots or grains  <cit> . recent molecular genetic studies have identified several gene families involved in the regulation of cd uptake or transport from arabidopsis, rice, and soybean , including the p1b-atpases, the natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins, and the cation diffusion facilitators  <cit> .

p1b-atpases are a subfamily of p-type atpases and have also been described as cpx-atpases  <cit> , metal p-type atpases  <cit> , and heavy metal atpases   <cit> . the main function of p1b-atpases is involved in the transport of metal cations across biological membrane  <cit> . previous studies showed that besides conserved regions in the p-type atpases, such as dktgt, gdgxndxp, pxxk, and s/tge, p1b-atpases specifically possess six to eight transmembrane segments , a hp locus, a cpx/spc motif  <cit>  essential for metal transport, and putative metal-binding domains in the n- and/or c-terminal regions  <cit> . unlike other p-type atpase subfamilies, p1b-atpases can transport multiple heavy metals, such as copper , zinc , cd, lead , and cobalt  in a wide range of organisms and are divided into two groups: cu/ag  and zn/cd/co/pb transporters , based on their substrate specificity  <cit> . in the model plants arabidopsis and rice, there are eight and nine p1b-atpases, respectively, which have been divided into six groups  <cit> . molecular genetic studies demonstrated that arabidopsis hma <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are specific to cu/ag transporters  <cit> , while hma <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are specific to zn/cd transporters  <cit> . in contrast to the other members of the hma gene family, athma <dig> likely contributes to two types of transporter activities  <cit> , and similar phenomena were also observed in rice hma members  <cit> .

soybean is an economically and nutritionally crucial crop, and provides not only vegetable protein and edible oil, but also essential amino acids for humans and animals. owing to the rapid urban and industrial development, cd contamination, especially in agricultural soils, is becoming a more and more serious problem in southern china . soybean is a cd-sensitive species and can accumulate cd even at low-cd soil concentrations. in addition, soybean genotypes are highly variable regarding cd tolerance and grain cd accumulation  <cit> , and several major quantitative trait loci associated with cd responses have been identified  <cit> . for example, cda <dig> and cd <dig> in chromosome  <dig> were associated with low-cd concentrations in grains. after narrowing the region between the two markers, six annotated genes, including gmhma1/gmhma <dig> , which is involved in cd response  <cit> . moreover, a study showed that gmhma <dig> is able to transport cu  <cit> . thus, soybean hma genes could play an important role in cd tolerance. however, molecular features and expression information on this family are largely unknown in soybean.

soybean is a paleopolyploid  <cit>  with two lineage-specific whole genomic duplications , resulting in ~75 % of the total gene complement being present in multiple copies  <cit> . here, we found that soybean has  <dig> hma genes, which is more than in arabidopsis or rice. for convenience, these genes were redefined from gmhma <dig> to gmhma <dig>  a phylogenetic analysis divided the  <dig> gmhmas into six clusters. based on the known hma functions in arabidopsis and rice, six gmhmas  were classified as zn2+-atpases, while the other hma members in soybean were identified as cu+-atpases. intron/exon structural patterns and conserved motifs among the  <dig> hmas showed a high level of consistency between gene organization and protein structure. the expression patterns of the  <dig> genes in different tissues and the variation of the snp distribution between wild and cultivated soybean lines suggest that they may be both functionally conserved and divergent. to further investigate the roles of these hma genes in cd tolerance, we examined their expression patterns in two previously identified soybean cd-responsive genotypes, hx <dig>  and zh <dig>   <cit> . analyses of the  <dig> hmas’ expression responses to cd stress provide an explanation for how plants deal with cd tolerance, in terms of the hma family, at least in the two examined contrasting soybean genotypes.

RESULTS
identification and nomenclature of hma genes in soybean
to investigate the hma gene family present in the soybean genome, the blast algorithm was used to search the phytozome website , with default settings, using the known soybean hma <dig> gene   <cit>  as the query. in total,  <dig> genes were identified. after screening these genes for the conserved hma motifs , the remaining  <dig> genes were considered hmas, which was consistent with the soybean genome annotation . a search using the blast algorithm, with another soybean hma <dig>   <cit>  gene as the query, revealed the same hma genes. to confirm that the identified proteins in soybean are potential hmas, we performed a multiple sequence alignment of the  <dig> hma protein sequences using dnaman and calculated manually the number of matches and mismatches based on the conserved hma motifs, as described previously  <cit> . thus, we believe that the soybean genome contains  <dig> putative hma genes. to validate whether these genes are truly expressed, the published rna-sequencing  data from  <dig> developing soybean tissues were used  <cit> . with the exception of gmhma <dig>  which had a low expression level in the stem, the other  <dig> gmhmas were expressed in multiple tissues .

for convenience, we redefined the soybean  <dig> hma genes, giving them unique names from gmhma <dig> to gmhma <dig> based on their chromosomal positions, and summarized relevant characteristics of the  <dig> soybean hmas , including annotation, chromosome location, gene loci from both glyma <dig>  and glyma.wm <dig>  a <dig>  v <dig> versions, protein lengths, and the features of exons and introns. to further understand the existing hma motifs, we then performed a complete multiple protein sequence alignment of all  <dig> hmas  and identified several conserved motifs , which were in general agreement with previously identified motifs in other hma proteins  <cit> . specifically, the  <dig> soybean hmas contained all six conserved motifs, dktgt, gdgxndxp, pxxk, tge, hp, and cpx/spc, as described previously . interestingly, gmhma <dig> lacked the pxxk motif and gmhma <dig> lacked the pxxk and gdgxndxp motifs. in addition, the replacement of dktgt with srqgt was also identified in gmhma <dig>  thus, these proteins may have divergent functions in soybean during evolution. the dktgt motif contains a phosphorylatable aspartate, and mutations of this aspartate inhibit the transport capabilities of athma <dig> and athma <dig>  <cit> . pxxk might interact with the oxygen of the phosphate transferred from atp  <cit> . d residues in gdgxndxp were identified as binding magnesium  <cit> . the replacement or loss of these motifs in gmhma <dig> and gmhma <dig> indicates that they might lose their functions during gene duplication. moreover, unlike other hmas with cpx motifs, gmhma <dig> and gmhma <dig> possessed a spc motif, which is a conserved characteristic of athma <dig> and oshma <dig>  <cit> .table  <dig> characteristics of  <dig> gmhmas



previous studies in both arabidopsis and rice showed that different hmas have distinct subcellular localizations  <cit> . we then predicted the subcellular localizations of the  <dig> hmas using targetp  <dig>  and found that only gmhma <dig> could be involved in the secretary pathway. gmhma <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> have a mitochondrial targeting peptide, whereas gmhma <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> have a chloroplast transit peptide. the localizations of the other  <dig> hmas was uncertain owing to the lack of a target peptide . the subcellular localization results also support the divergent functions of hmas under certain cellular contexts. moreover, unlike other p-type atpases, p1b-atpases have distinct characteristics because of the reduced number of tms, usually six to eight  <cit> . we used the tmhmm server to measure the number of tms in the soybean hmas. the result showed that, except for five members  in three clusters  having less than six tms, the other members identified had six to eight tms. in particular, gmhma <dig> does not contain any tms, suggesting that it might have lost some functions during gene expansion.

phylogenetic analysis and chromosomal distribution of soybean hma genes
to explore the evolutionary relationships of soybean hma genes, we performed an unrooted phylogenetic analysis for  <dig> hma genes from arabidopsis , rice , and soybean using neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood methods . the tree topologies produced by the two methods are largely consistent with each other, with only minor differences at the interior nodes. both trees divided the hmas into six distinct clusters, which was consistent with previous studies  <cit> . each cluster included genes from arabidopsis, rice, and soybean, suggesting that the same cluster had a common ancestor. based on sequence similarities and the phylogenetic tree’s topology, the hmas were also classified into two groups: zn2+-atpases  and cu+-atpases  . the former is responsible for zn, cd, co, and pb transport, while the latter specifically transports cu and ag. the relative positions in the phylogenetic tree showed that the genes in clusters iii and vi were more closely related to each other than to those in cluster i or ii, which is consistent with their different metal transport capabilities.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of hma genes among arabidopsis, soybean, and rice. neighbor-joining  methods were used to construct the hma unrooted tree using hma amino acid sequences in soybean, arabidopsis, and rice. nj bootstrap values are presented for each main clade



as mentioned earlier, soybean has more than double the number of hma members than either arabidopsis or rice, which was likely caused by the recent wgd in soybean. gene duplication mechanisms include tandem duplication  and large segmental/wgd events  <cit> . to examine which contributed to the expansion of the gmhma gene family, a chromosome map was constructed based on the locations provided by the soybase . the  <dig> gmhma genes showed an unequal distribution along the  <dig> soybean chromosomes . for example, chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> had three genes, chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> contained two genes, and chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> only had single hma genes . gmhma <dig> and gmhma <dig> are likely tandem-duplicated genes because both genes are linked in ~5 kb .fig.  <dig> distribution of soybean hma genes on chromosomes. chromosome size is indicated by its relative length. the scale on the left is in megabases . the vertical bars on the chromosomes indicate the positions of the centromeres. segmental duplicated genes are indicated by red lines. the figure was produced and modified using the map inspector program



recent studies indicated that ~75 % of soybean genes are paralogous pairs  <cit> . we detected the potential paralogous pairs among the  <dig> gmhmas using mcscanx as described previously  <cit>  and estimated the duplication time of paralogous pairs using kaks_calculator  <dig>    <cit> . subsequently, the  <dig> paralogous pairs and their duplication time were identified , and included nine pairs of wgd-paralogs: gmhma3/ <dig>  gmhma4/ <dig>  gmhma5/ <dig>  gmhma6/ <dig>  gmhma7/ <dig>  gmhma9/ <dig>  gmhma12/ <dig>  gmhma13/ <dig>  and gmhma14/ <dig>  and  <dig> td-paralog, gmhma1/ <dig>  by comparing the positions of the gmhmas on the chromosome map  and in the phylogenetic tree , we found that, for gmhmas that are clustered together on a chromosome, their respective paralogs were also clustered together on a different chromosome. for example, gmhma <dig> and  <dig> are clustered on the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  and the corresponding paralogs gmhma <dig> and  <dig> are clustered together in the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  similarly, gmhma <dig> and  <dig> on chromosome  <dig> correspond to gmhma <dig> and  <dig> on chromosome  <dig> 

comparisons of gene structures, protein motifs, and snp distributions among the  <dig> hmas in soybean
the intron/exon organization, and the intron types and numbers indicate the evolutionary history within some gene families . we examined these features in the  <dig> gmhma genes and observed that members of the same cluster, such as cluster  <dig>  and cluster  <dig> , shared similar exon/intron structures, such as intron number and exon arrangement . in contrast, some members of the same cluster showed variations in the intron/exon organization. for example, obvious changes were found in the 5′ termini of genes when compared with their paralogous pairs, such as gmhma <dig>  gmhma <dig>  and gmhma <dig>  gmhma <dig> was observed to have a new insertion in the last exon at the 3′ terminus, suggesting it may have obtained a different function. gmhma <dig> lacked seven exons, including those from the 2nd to 4th, and from the 14th to 17th. additionally, gmhma <dig> had a truncation in the 1st exon compared with its paralog gmhma <dig>  . we also compared the sequence similarities of the exons among the  <dig> hmas, as shown in fig.  <dig>  the distribution of similar exons was uneven. one gene could have only one exon, while another gene could have multiple exons. thus, intron/exon structure likely resulted in functional conservation and/or diversification during the long-term evolution in the soybean hma gene family.fig.  <dig> schematic for hma intron/exon structures in soybean. the gray lines indicate introns, the green boxes represent exons, the orange boxes indicate 5′ untranslated regions, the blue boxes represent 3′ untranslated regions, and the purple boxes represent novel exons. similar exon sequences are connected by gray shaded lines



as mentioned earlier, hma proteins contain several highly conserved motifs, while the functions in the different clusters are obviously divergent. it is reasonable to speculate that, besides the common motifs, each group may have their own specific motifs. therefore, a motif comparative analysis was conducted for the  <dig> hmas. as shown in fig.  <dig>   <dig> types of motifs were observed. clearly, the  <dig> hmas had the same five motifs, motifs 4– <dig>  representing the primary domains of the p1b-atpases. among these five conserved motifs, motif  <dig> represents tge, motif  <dig> represents cpx/spc, motif  <dig> represents dktgt, and motif  <dig> represents hp. however, motif  <dig> was not well annotated, suggesting that it could be a novel motif in the hmas. moreover, the same clusters had similar patterns in terms of motif types, order, and numbers . for example, members of clusters i and iv shared the same motif pattern, suggesting a potential functional redundancy. however, several proteins lost or gained new motifs in either the n- or c-terminus, such as gmhma <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which lost motif  <dig> or  <dig> in their n-termini, while gmhma <dig> had a new motif  <dig> in the c-terminus when compared with their paralogous pairs, suggesting a functional divergence between paralogous pairs. genes with similar exon/intron structures likely have similar motif organizations. for example, genes in clusters i and iv displayed similar structural organization, and proteins in these clusters showed consistent motif arrangements.fig.  <dig> diagrammatic representation of the  <dig> motif architectures of the hma proteins in soybean. conserved motifs in soybean hma proteins were identified using the meme search tool. different motifs are indicated by different shapes with distinct colors, and the names of all of the members are shown on the left side of the figure. the motif matches are shown with a cutoff p-value less than  <dig> 



to confirm the observed gene structure using the public dataset, we examined the  <dig> gene transcripts using the rna-seq data from  <dig> developing soybean tissues  <cit> . except for gmhma <dig>  which contained novel exons , the exon structures of the genes were in agreement with the previous annotation.

to further investigate functional conservation and divergence among the  <dig> hmas, we analyzed the distribution of snps previously generated from  <dig> wild and cultivated soybean lines  <cit> . in total,  <dig> snps were identified and 15 % of them were located in the exons. in addition, the snp distribution pattern was obviously different between paralogous pairs. while gmhma5/ <dig> and gmhma13/ <dig> displayed similar numbers of snps in both exon and intron/untranslated regions, the other pairs exhibited snp variations in either the exon or intron/untranslated regions . specifically, both gmhma <dig> and  <dig> showed higher snp numbers over the whole gene than their paralogs gmhma <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. a similar situation was also found between gmhma <dig> and  <dig> . further analysis showed that ~55 % snps  in exons were non-synonymous. with the exception of gmhma <dig> without non-synonymous mutation, gmhma <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> displayed > 80 % of non-synonymous mutation rate. thus, the different snp distribution patterns and non-synonymous mutation rate, especially between paralogous pairs, provides additional evidence to support the functional divergence among hmas during evolution.

expression analysis of hma genes in soybean and a comparison of the corresponding homologs in arabidopsis and rice
to further understand the potential functions of gmhma genes, we investigated the expression patterns of  <dig> soybean hmas using our previously generated rna-seq data from  <dig> tissues of hx <dig>  a soybean cultivar  <cit> . this dataset allowed us to detect  <dig> genes  and, except for gmhma <dig>  gmhma <dig>  and gmhma <dig>  they showed expression in specific tissues or developmental stages as detected by rna-seq from developing tissues of  <dig> soybeans . as shown in fig.  <dig>  genes in different clusters showed non-overlapping expression patterns, suggesting divergent functions, whereas genes in the same clusters usually displayed similar expression patterns, indicating a functional redundancy between paralogous pairs. for example, cluster iv exhibited a different expression pattern than other clusters. furthermore, two pairs of paralogs in cluster iv were also different, but each pair showed a similar expression pattern, such as gmhma <dig> and  <dig> having their highest expression levels in callus, whereas gmhma <dig> and  <dig> had their highest levels in roots .fig.  <dig> heatmap of soybean hma genes in  <dig> examined tissues. am, axillary meristem; sam6d, sam17d, and sam38d, shoot apical meristem at the 6-, 17-, and 38-day stages, respectively; ibm, inflorescences before meiotic stage; iam, inflorescences after meiotic stage; of, open flower



to compare the corresponding homologs in other species, we also obtained the expression profiles of hma genes in roots, stems , leaves, flowers , pods, and seeds from soybean , arabidopsis , and rice  generated by soyseq, atgenexpress, and plexdb, respectively. most of the genes in soybean, arabidopsis and rice had very broad expression spectra. genes from the same cluster also exhibited similar expression patterns among the three species, suggesting that the genes’ functions are highly conserved among the different species. for example, most genes from clusters ii–iv were preferentially expressed in the roots of the three species , suggesting that those genes may play an important role in root development or stress response. in addition, gmhma <dig> and  <dig> shared the same expression patterns in leaves, and their arabidopsis counterpart, athma <dig>  also showed a similar pattern. however, gmhma <dig> and  <dig> in cluster i showed high expression levels in leaves, which was inconsistent with their counterpart hma <dig>  which was highly expressed in arabidopsis flowers and in rice seeds, suggesting a functional divergence. thus, based on the hmas’ expression information among soybean, rice, and arabidopsis, we speculated that the hma gene family may have a distinct functional conservation and redundancy among different species.

validation of gmhma gene expression in different tissues and an analysis of their responses to cd stress using qrt-pcr
to validate the gmhma expression information from the published database generated by soyseq, we conducted a qrt-pcr experiment using six samples  from two genotypes, hx <dig>  and zh <dig>  under normal conditions. fifteen candidate genes were detected in at least one tissue . because the public soybean data and our qrt-pcr experiment used similar tissues, the expression patterns of most of the examined genes were consistent between the two methods, except for the undetectable gmhma <dig> and  <dig>  seven genes  and two genes  were preferentially expressed in roots and leaves, respectively. these results support the reliability of our hma expression information.

previous studies demonstrated that hmas play very important roles in cd responses in soybean  <cit> . in this study, we compared the expression patterns of  <dig> soybean hma genes between two contrasting genotypes, hx <dig> and zh <dig>  with and without cd treatments. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the expression of  <dig> genes, but not gmhma <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  were detected in at least one tissue. among the detected genes, gmhma <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> showed wide range expression in the examined tissues, while the other  <dig> genes displayed tissue-preferential or -specific expression. in total,  <dig> genes displayed significant changes in their cd responses between the genotypes or at least in one tissue . for example, gmhma <dig>  a root-specific gene, was undetectable in hx <dig> without cd treatment, but was detectable in roots treated with cd. however, no significant expression changes were observed in zh <dig> in response to cd stress. a similar expression pattern was also found for gmhma <dig>  interestingly, gmhma <dig> was identified as a major gene for cd accumulation in soybean grains  <cit>  and showed root-specific expression in a cd-unresponsive manner. the expression levels of gmhma <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were significantly increased in hx <dig> seeds, but only gmhma <dig> and  <dig> were detected in zh <dig>  by cd induction. furthermore, some gene expression levels were also altered in other tissue by the cd treatment, indicating that plant responses to cd stress may be involved in the coordinate regulation of hma gene expression. these findings provide an explanation for the molecular mechanisms of cd responses in hx <dig> and zh <dig> fig.  <dig> expression patterns of hma genes in six tissues in two soybean genotypes by qrt-pcr. samples are color coded: hx <dig> without cd treatment  in green, hx <dig> with cd treatment  in gray, zh <dig> without cd treatment  in red, zh <dig> with cd treatment  in blue. for each gene, the expression levels obtained by normalization to act <dig> are presented on relative scales. data are average values ± sd from three experiments, each carried out in triplicate. the significance of the changes between hx <dig> and zh <dig> with or without cd was assessed using the student’s t-test at the level of p ≤  <dig>   and p ≤  <dig>  



gene structure and protein motif organization analyses indicated that functional redundancy and divergence might occur between paralogous pairs. to test this hypothesis, a comparative analysis of expression patterns was conducted between each paralogous pair. except for four paralogous pairs  that had detectable expression information in at most one gene, the other paralogous pairs could be classified into three different types based on their expression change after cd exposure. the type i response, which displayed similar expression patterns between paralogous pairs without cd exposure, but showed different changes after the cd treatment, was observed for gmhma5/ <dig>  gmhma1/ <dig>  and gmhma7/ <dig>  for example, both gmhma <dig> and  <dig> were expressed in six examined tissues; however, gmhma <dig> expression was significantly reduced in zh <dig> roots, while gmhma <dig> displayed an obvious induction in hx <dig> leaves in response to cd exposure. in addition, both gmhma <dig> and  <dig> were predominantly expressed in roots, but they exhibited opposite cd responses, suggesting a functional divergence. type ii had different expression patterns with or without cd treatments. for instance, gmhma <dig> and  <dig> were mainly expressed in roots and stems, respectively. however, only gmhma <dig> displayed a cd response. a similar situation was found for gmhma12/ <dig>  type iii only included gmhma14/ <dig>  which showed comparative expression levels between the genotypes and the cd treatments. together, these results also provide an explanation of how the genetic variation in hx <dig> and zh <dig> affected cd responses in terms of altered paralogous gene expression levels after cd exposure.

discussion
soybean is a critical source of vegetable protein and edible oil, and has the ability to accumulate cd in its seeds. understanding the mechanisms of cd accumulation in soybeans grown in cd-contaminated soil is a very important issue for food safety. previous studies demonstrated that p1b-atpases play crucial roles in the detoxification and accumulation of cd in several species, but mainly model plants, such as arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . recently, extensive studies also identified gmhma <dig>  <cit>   and gmhma <dig>  <cit>  from soybean, as being involved in heavy metal responses, but the molecular features and expression patterns of the hma family remained to be investigated. the present study fully used molecular methods and systematic bioinformatics to analyze the hma family in soybean as related to cd responses.

wgd causes the expansion of hma genes in soybean
gene duplications are considered a primary driving force in the evolution of genomes and genetic systems  <cit> . a recent study indicated that 90 % and 62 % of loci have undergone duplication events in arabidopsis and rice, respectively  <cit> . polyploidy generates massive duplications, resulting in an important source of genetic innovation  <cit> . soybean is a paleopolyploid  <cit> , leading to nearly 75 % of the genes being present in multiple copies  <cit> . a recent study indicated that  <dig> and  <dig>  duplicate genes were caused by td and wgd, respectively  <cit> . here, we identified  <dig> members of the hma family in soybean and revealed that these  <dig> genes could be  <dig> paralogous pairs. among them, one pair is a tandem repeat, supporting the idea that td was also involved in the expansion of the soybean hma gene family. the other nine pairs evolved from segmental duplications, suggesting that segmental duplication plays a pivotal role in hma gene expansion in the soybean genome. this has also been found for other gene families in soybean  <cit> .

possible conservation and divergence of hma genes in soybean
gene duplication is an important mechanism for understanding evolutionary novelties, while a divergence of the duplicated gene’s expression is highly correlated with a functional divergence  <cit> . expression patterns detected by both public rna-seq data  and qrt-pcr using multiple tissues provided evidence that nearly all of the soybean hma genes detected had wide or distinct expression patterns, indicating that soybean hma genes are likely functional after wgd events. most soybean hma genes are expressed in multiple tissues, suggesting that they have a general role in plant development. a small number of soybean hma genes showed tissue-preferential expression, suggesting that those genes may have specific roles in a certain cell context.

the comparison of paralogous pairs’ expression patterns revealed that some pairs had similar expression patterns, suggesting that they might have undergone sub-functionalization, further supporting the idea that sub-functionalization might be a predominant event for wgd-duplicated genes in soybean. for example, gmhma5/ <dig> are expressed in multiple tissues. several pairs displayed different expression patterns, indicating that they might have undergone neo-functionalization after wgd in soybean. for example, gmham <dig> was predominantly expressed in roots, while its paralog gmhma <dig> was mainly expressed in stems . in addition, comparative analyses of gene expression with non-synonymous mutation rate among paralogs showed that non-synonymous mutation rate had a significant negative correlation with the gene expression levels. for instance, gmhma <dig> and  <dig> showed higher non-synonymous mutation rate , while displayed lower gene expression than their paralogs  . thus, our results provide an overall view of the functional redundancy and divergence in the hma family that occurred after wgd in soybean.

potential role of hma genes in soybean cd responses
previous studies demonstrated that gmhma <dig>  <cit>   and gmhma <dig>  <cit>  are involved in heavy metal responses. to fully address the overall expression patterns of hma in soybean, we examined their expression patterns in two genotypes with contrasting cd responses, hx <dig>  and zh <dig>   <cit> , with or without cd treatments . the coordinate and distinct expression patterns of the hma family members indicated that they might systematically regulate cd redistribution. specifically, hma <dig> was identified in both arabidopsis and rice, and displayed the same subcellular localization in chloroplasts  <cit> . however, it was demonstrated to be involved in cu and zn transport in arabidopsis and rice, respectively  <cit> . changes in the cu/zn distribution may affect cu/zn superoxide dismutase activities  <cit> , finally leading to cd resistance  <cit> . here, we found, using targetp  <dig> , that the soybean homolog gmhma <dig> also had a chloroplast transit peptide . the expression pattern of gmhma <dig> resembled its arabidopsis homolog, suggesting that it may also have a similar role in soybean. however, significant changes in gmhma <dig> expression under cd treatment were found in hx <dig>  but not in zh <dig>  providing an explanation for hx3’s cd tolerance. it is likely that gmhma <dig> elevates cu/zn superoxide dismutase activity in chloroplasts  <cit> .

the phylogenetic tree showed that cluster ii contains four soybean hma genes  and three arabidopsis genes  . gmhma <dig> and  <dig> are homologs of athma <dig> and  <dig>  while gmhma <dig> and  <dig> are the athma <dig> homologs. in arabidopsis, athma <dig> and athma <dig> have similar expression patterns, and are expressed mainly in vascular tissues  <cit> . genetic studies demonstrated that both genes contribute to cd translocation from roots to shoots. additionally, the rice homolog oshma <dig> also has a similar function in cd translocation  <cit> . in contrast, soybean gmhma <dig> was mainly expressed in the seeds of both hx <dig> and zh <dig> . interestingly, gmhma <dig> was only expressed in the seeds of zh <dig> after cd exposure. this finding not only indicates a functional divergence of this gene across different species, but also supports the high cd accumulation observed in zh <dig> 

athma <dig> was the first hma identified as a cd/pb transporter and can rescue the ycf <dig> yeast mutant strain  <cit> . its expression is strictly in vascular tissues and root apices  <cit> , which was also observed for the rice homolog of oshma <dig>  <cit> . a functional study demonstrated that oshma <dig> has an important role in the translocation of cd to the tonoplast, thereby creating seeds with low cd accumulation  <cit> . the soybean homolog gmhma <dig> showed a cd-responsive expression in stems of both hx <dig> and zh <dig>  but gmhma <dig> , a soybean homolog of athma <dig>  did not response to cd. in previous studies a single-base substitution was found in gmhma <dig>  a major gene controlling seed cd accumulation, but there was no significant expression difference between the two types of soybean genotypes with contrasting cd accumulation levels .

moreover, the distinct expression of the gmhma13/ <dig> paralogous pair suggests that they might gain new functions after duplication. gmhma <dig> was a cd-unresponsive gene with root-specific expression, but its expression level was higher in zh <dig> than in hx <dig>  indicating that it may help zh <dig> to redistribute more cd in the roots. whereas, gmhma <dig> is a cd-responsive gene and its expression level in stem was also higher in zh <dig> than in hx <dig>  with or without cd treatments, indicating that zh <dig> may accumulate more cd than hx <dig> in both shoots and seeds.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we show that the soybean genome has  <dig> hma family members, presented as  <dig> paralogous pairs, which is significantly more than in arabidopsis and rice, which is likely the result of the latest wgd in soybean. the phylogenetic analysis divided the  <dig> members into six groups, each having conserved or divergent gene structure and protein motif patterns. integration of rna-seq and qrt-pcr data from multiple tissues provided the overall expression patterns for the hma family in soybean. a further comparison of the expression patterns of the paralogous pairs provides insights into the functional conservation and divergence of hma genes in soybean. finally, analyses of hma expression patterns in response to cd stress provided an explanation of how plants manage cd tolerance, in terms of the hma family, at least in the examined soybean genotypes.
