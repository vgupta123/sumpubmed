BACKGROUND
in all mammals, atrial cardiac muscle cells  display phenotypic differences with their ventricular counterparts owing to the endocrine function of the former. atrial cardiocytes contain secretory-like granules known as specific atrial granules, which co-store two polypeptide hormones, atrial natriuretic factor  and b-type natriuretic peptide , referred to as cardiac natriuretic peptides .

the increase in atrial np gene expression and secretion observed during hemodynamic overload is viewed as a cardioprotective mechanism based on the capacity of anf and bnp to reduce load by modulating renal function, vessel tone, as well as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and the sympathetic nervous systems, among others.

considerable effort has been focused on the elucidation of the mechanistic underlying of anf and bnp gene expression and secretion by the atrial cardiocytes. the majority of these investigations have concentrated on pharmacological interventions but much remains to be determined regarding specific genes involved in cardiocyte secretory function. this information is important however, to understand why under chronic conditions of hemodynamic overload such as in chronic congestive heart failure, the secretion of anf and bnp is insufficient as demonstrated by the fact that patients that receive exogenous hormone benefit from the unloading of the heart induced by therapeutic administration of either of the hormones  <cit> . through the present work we have defined genes that may be fitted within a more detailed view of cardiac endocrine function.

RESULTS
differentially expressed genes between atrial and ventricular tissues
from the  <dig> probe sets found on the microarray, an average of 59% and 56% of probes had present calls in the atria and ventricles, respectively. based on a  <dig>  fold change ratio criterion,  <dig> probe sets were statistically differentially expressed between the atria and ventricles. of these,  <dig> probe sets showed higher expression levels in the atrial samples and  <dig> probe sets showed higher expression levels in the ventricles. the degree of change of the differentially expressed probes ranged between the  <dig>  fold minimum set cut-off and  <dig> fold . chamber specific genes were found differentially expressed in our dataset. sarcolipin, an atrial-specific ca+ <dig> binding protein was expressed  <dig>  fold higher in the atria than the ventricles. other atrial specific genes include dickkopf homolog  <dig>  , anf , and myosin light chain 2a . in the ventricles, four-and-a-half lim domain  <dig> , myosin light chain polypeptide  <dig>  and iroquois homeobox protein  <dig>   were identified. differential expression of  <dig> candidate genes was confirmed by real time-pcr. the results show excellent agreement between the microarray and pcr data . several genes exhibited a higher fold change ratio when analyzed by pcr as compared to microarray.

functional classification
differentially expressed genes between the atria and the ventricles were functionally classified into four major gene ontology categories: biological process, cellular component, molecular function and unclassified. an individual transcript was included in several categories or subcategories because of its relevance to more than one category or subcategory. out of the  <dig> significantly differentially expressed probes,  <dig> were grouped as unclassified, i.e. had unknown annotations at the time of the study. figure  <dig> illustrates the extent in gene expression differences found between the two heart tissues across functional classes.

biological processes
differentially expressed genes were similarly abundant in cell communication and signal transduction processes and they were mainly found involved in cell growth, metabolism, transport, g protein-dependent signaling, and protein kinase cascade . differentially expressed g protein-dependent signaling transcripts include those grouped in subcategories such as glutamate signaling, g protein signaling, neuropeptide signaling pathway, and serotonin receptor signaling . regulators of g-protein signaling  rgs <dig> and rgs <dig> were more abundant in the atria  while rgs <dig> was prevalent in the ventricles  . other accessory proteins for g proteins that were found differentially expressed include periplakin , rasd <dig>   and β-site app cleaving enzyme  <dig> . these genes were more abundant in the atria while rasd <dig>  and ags3-like  were more abundant in the ventricles. all these accessory proteins, including the rgs proteins interact with gαi/o  <cit> . small gtpase-mediated signal transduction transcripts found differentially expressed include regulators of membrane trafficking including rab <dig> , rab <dig>  and rab40b . the rab escort protein choroidermia, known to interact with rab3a and rab27a, as well as the rab27a effector protein synaptotagmin-like  <dig> were abundantly expressed in the atria by  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold, respectively. the latter is known to bind and regulate the gtp-bound form of ras-related protein rab27a, which has been shown to positively regulate the exocytosis of secretory granules in pancreatic beta cells and pituitary tissue  <cit> .

positive fold change values indicate a higher abundance in the atria as compared to the ventricles, while negative fold change values demonstrate a higher ventricular abundance in comparison to the atria.

genes involved in secretion included signal sequence receptor gamma  , blocked early in transport  <dig> homolog   , vesicle trafficking protein like  <dig>  , synapsin iii  and annexin a <dig> . these genes were found more abundant in the atria when compared to the ventricles.

cellular component
within the gene ontology category of cellular components, the intracellular components subcategory contained the largest amount of differentially expressed genes  in comparison to the extracellular  and the membrane components . cellular components that had prominent atrial abundant transcripts included those associated with the plasma membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum , the golgi apparatus, and the nucleus, while the ventricles were associated with abundant transcripts found within the mitochondrion and peroxisome components . er and golgi-associated genes that were abundantly expressed in the atria include stearoyl-coa desaturase  <dig>  and  <dig> , inositol  <dig> ,5-triphosphate receptor  <dig> , ribosome associated membrane protein  <dig> , sec <dig> like  <dig> , as well as ssr <dig>  transcripts involved in er to golgi vesicle-mediated transport include the previously mentioned genes sec <dig> and bet <dig>  other atrial abundant golgi resident proteins include islet cell autoantigen of  <dig>  , transforming growth factor-β <dig>  , nucleobindin  <dig>  and golgi transport  <dig> homolog b  .

molecular function
the molecular function subcategories that were most notably differentially expressed between atrial and ventricular muscles included enzyme, signal transducer, structural protein, and transport . the signal transducer subcategory is composed of ligands and receptors . the cytokines, frizzled receptor ligands, growth factor receptor ligands as well as hormone receptor ligands subcategories were also significantly differentiated. differentially expressed genes involved in hormone, hormonal activity, and hormone receptor ligand subcategories, including anf  and bnp , as well as secretory granule neuroendocrine protein  <dig>   are listed in table  <dig>  preliminary immunohistochemistry analysis localized sgne <dig> in structures compatible with adrenergic varicosities . differentially expressed transcription factors/dna binding proteins were more abundant in the atria than in the ventricles .

positive fold change values indicate a higher abundance in the atria as compared to the ventricles, while negative values demonstrate a higher ventricular abundance in comparison to the atria.

in general, genes coding for transport proteins were more abundant in the atria than in the ventricles. potassium channels, which were most abundant in the atria included potassium channel subfamily k member  <dig> , as well as potassium inwardly-rectifying channel, subfamily j, member  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the ventricles were most abundant in the potassium inwardly-rectifying channel, subfamily j, member  <dig>  channel subunit.

positive fold change values indicate a higher abundance in the atria as compared to the ventricles, while negative values demonstrate a higher ventricular abundance in comparison to the atria.

pathway analysis
pathway analysis using the gene map annotator and pathway profiler  software identified clusters of differentially expressed genes found within the same biological pathway. visual representation of specific known pathways, referred as mapps, revealed several mapps in which atrial gene expression was predominant. these mapps included pathways of fatty acid synthesis, prostaglandin synthesis, as well as eicosanoid synthesis, which shows a higher abundance of phospholipase a <dig>  , cox <dig>  and cox <dig> . in contrast, mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid β-oxidation and glucocorticoid metabolism pathways were dominant in ventricular samples. mapps other than those from metabolic processes, revealed atrial regional specialization in regards to the classical component activation pathway and g-protein signaling pathway . the latter demonstrated a higher abundance of the gαo <dig> subunit , kcnj <dig> and kcnj <dig> in the atrium compared to the ventricle by  <dig> ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  fold, respectively. also, gγ <dig> , gγ <dig>   and phosphodiesterase 7a   as well as inositol  <dig> ,5-triphosphate receptor  <dig>   were highly expressed in the atria while protein kinase c epsilon  was more abundant in the ventricles by  <dig>  fold. gβ subunits  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were present in both atria and ventricles at roughly similar levels while gβ <dig>  was expressed at higher levels in the ventricles .

discussion
mammalian atrial and ventricular cardiocytes display striking differences in phenotype. the bulk of atrial cardiocytes have, in addition to features commonly associated with striated cardiac muscle cell cytology, organelles that are normally found in cells engaged in the synthesis, vectorial transport and secretion of polypeptide hormones. these include an abundance of rough endoplasmic reticulum, a highly developed golgi complex and storage granules containing hormonal products. these cytological features led to a series of past investigations that culminated in the discovery of the endocrine function of the heart  <cit> , which is largely mediated by the polypeptide hormones anf and bnp.

from the data presented here it is evident that the phenotypic differences between the atria and the ventricles results from underlying differences in degree or presence/absence of several specific genes. despite this complex background of differential expression, the microarray data reproducibility observed in different biological replicates was excellent.

the proportion of probes that were called present, as well as the number of differentially expressed genes was higher in the atria than in the ventricles. this observation could be related to a higher functional complexity of the atrial tissue, which include contraction, excitation, conduction, secretion and the presence of a profuse innervation  <cit> . the detection of numerous known chamber specific transcripts  <cit>  supports the robustness of the genechip data and demonstrates that the differences in gene expression profiles observed between the atrial and ventricular tissues are not spurious in nature. a comparative analysis of the differentially expressed genes identified in other studies that are in common with our data is presented in the additional file  <dig>  several genes identified in these studies by others are in agreement with our data, even though there are experimental differences  as well as data analysis between studies. however, none of these previous studies focused specifically on gene expression profiles relating to the endocrine function of the heart.

based on atrial and ventricular phenotypical differences, the strategy used in the data mining process was to identify genes that had gene ontology annotations relating to hormone secretion, hormone activity, vesicle/granule packaging and transport. screening for gene ontology terms classified as golgi apparatus and er cellular components was also undertaken in an effort to identify genes involved in the regulation of np packaging and secretion. differentially expressed transcription factors as well as transcripts coding for proteins involved in signal transduction such as ligands and receptors were also of great interest. finally, hormone secretion can be modulated/regulated by ion channels and mechanosensors, hence genes coding for transport proteins were also of interest. differentially expressed genes coding for proteins involved in metabolic processes as well as contractile proteins were not specifically looked at since these differences are expected to be found between the atrial and ventricular tissues but are not thought to be involved in the endocrine function of the heart. in general, functional classification of the differentially expressed genes according to their cellular components, identified in our study, parallels the results obtained by barth et al., <cit> , which include ventricular abundance of mitochondrial genes as well as the identification of numerous atrial abundant er and golgi apparatus transcripts, such as sec <dig> and rab <dig>  the larger number of probes hybridizing to cellular components involved in secretory function agrees with the phenotypic and functional differences between atrial and ventricular muscle. for example, atrial cardiocytes were more abundant in the transcripts coding for anf and bnp than the ventricles. correspondingly, anf transcript abundance, which constitutes one to three percent of total atrial mrna  <cit>  was found to provide for the top one percent of the genechip® signal intensities. saturation of the fluorescent signal is thought to have occurred for anf probe sets, which explains the plateau level of  <dig> fold difference between atrial vs. ventricular tissues as compared to  <dig> fold with rt-pcr . oligonucleotide probe saturation can occur when the labeled crna is at high enough levels to result in an almost 100% probe/crna hybridization complex. any other increase in expression would not be measurable due to the olignucleotide hybridization saturation. it is difficult to estimate the amount of crna needed to saturate the oligonulceotide probes since the specific number of oligonucleotide probes tiled onto the  <dig> micron surface area of the genechip® is proprietary information.

storage granule-associated proteins identified in this study include ica <dig>  <cit>  and sgne <dig>  the evolutionary conserved gene ica <dig>  was shown to be abundant in human pancreas and heart, and moderately expressed in brain  <cit> . variable expression of 5'-untranslated region exons from the ica <dig> gene was shown to be tissue specific, where cardiac tissue distinctively expressed the exon b <dig> transcript variant  <cit> . the original observation that ica <dig> expression levels were high in the heart but null in skeletal muscle lead pietropaolo et al.,  <cit>  to postulate that ica <dig> was present in selective cells. we demonstrate here that ica <dig> is expressed specifically in the atria given that all four ventricular replicates exhibited an absent detection call for this transcript .

several studies have been able to co-localize sgne <dig>  a member of the secretogranin family, with neuropeptides and hormones in various tissues that are primarily composed of neuronal or endocrine cells, as well as tissues known to contain a sub-population of neuroendocrine cells  <cit> . rt-pcr analysis further confirmed atrial abundance of sgne <dig> . sgne <dig> has not been previously associated with the atria or the heart. our own immunofluorescence preliminary data suggest that sgne <dig> protein is localized in structures compatible with adrenergic varicosities .

differentially expressed transcription factors/dna binding proteins that were more abundant in the atria than in the ventricles included numerous orphan nuclear receptors. two out of the three affymetrix probe sets assaying for nuclear receptor subfamily  <dig>  group f, member  <dig>  transcripts were identified in the atrial abundant gene list. nr2f <dig> expression pattern is in agreement with previously published data  and real-time pcr analysis further validated its atrial abundance . other atrial abundant transcription factors include paired-like homeodomain transcription factor  <dig> , which is involved in atrial septation; t-box protein  <dig> , a known activator of the anf promoter; and early growth response  <dig> , which is up-regulated during endothelin, angiotensin ii, ischemia and stretch treatments. hairy/enhancer-of-split related with yrpw motif  <dig> , as well as its activator notch <dig>  were more abundant in the ventricles than in the atria. hey <dig> is thought to repress anf expression in the ventricles  <cit> . the known tissue specificity of several of these transcription factors further illustrates the soundness of the dataset and the identification of novel atrial abundant dna binding proteins warrants further attention.

of special importance to the understanding of the regulation of hormone secretion by the atria are genes that encode for molecular species involved in mechanical aspect of atrial activity given that a major stimulus for anf and bnp secretion is atrial muscle stretch. this phenomenon is referred to as "stretch-secretion coupling"  <cit> . questions still remain regarding the exact stimulus perceived by the atrial cardiocytes as well as the precise signal transduction cascade that leads to an increase in anf and bnp secretion following stretch. therefore, the finding that mechanoreceptors  as well as mechanosensors  are most abundant in the atria is central to the generation and the testing of hypothesis. because some prostaglandins are known to be potent stimulators of anf synthesis and secretion  <cit> , it is of interest that the mechanosensor pla <dig> is abundantly expressed in the atria. activation of pla <dig> following plasma membrane stretch could cause the release of arachidonic acid, a substrate for prostaglandin synthase.

the rapid secretory response following stretch of atrial cardiocytes as compared to the response to other anf secretion agonists such as endothelin- <dig>   <cit>  has long suggested that the phenomenon of stretch-secretion coupling is related to mechanosensitive ion channels. it has been suggested  <cit>  that katp channels are involved in stretch-secretion coupling. these channels are stretch-sensitive  <cit> , are known to couple to g proteins, including gαo  <cit> , and have been associated with other secretory processes  <cit> . the results and conclusions reached from investigations on the involvement of katp channels on anf secretion have often been contradictory. an inspection of the literature suggests that a likely reason for these discrepancies may lie on differences in experimental systems   <cit> . most importantly, pharmacological studies have been made with little reference to the several candidate ion channels that may be present in the atria. the present investigation shows that kir <dig>  is significantly expressed in the ventricles. the atp binding cassette sur <dig>  whose expression level  didn't meet the fold cut-off criteria was more abundant in the ventricles, and, while not significant, kir <dig>  and sur <dig> had marginally higher expression in atria.

three other channels had significantly higher levels of expression in the atria over the ventricles. these included the inward rectifiers kcnj <dig>  kcnj <dig> and the background channel trek- <dig>  kcnj <dig>  channels, which are activated by g protein coupled receptors  coupled to pertussis toxin  sensitive gi/o proteins, exhibit mechanosensitive properties and might participate in a mechanoelectrical feedback pathway regulating anf and bnp secretion  <cit> . this view is in line with our recent finding that ptx can abolish stretch secretion coupling  <cit> . the background channel trek- <dig> produces an outwardly rectifying current and is a member of the  <dig> pore domain potassium  channel family. trek- <dig> has been characterized as a stretch-activated membrane channel. it is primarily expressed in the central nervous system but has been found in cardiac tissues  <cit>  as well as in specific endocrine cells, such as adrenocortical cells  <cit> . atrial abundance of trek- <dig> was further validated by rt-pcr . immunohistochemical analysis localized trek- <dig> protein in isolated adult rat atrial cardiocytes and it is suggested that trek- <dig> may act as a regulator of anf secretion  <cit> .

the complex signal transduction pathways resulting from the activation of gpcrs is in part orchestrated by an assorted population of g proteins, assembled from a various combinations of  <dig> gα,  <dig> gβ and  <dig> gγ isoforms  <cit> . pathway analysis of the microarray data revealed differential expression of genes involved in g protein signaling pathways between atrial and ventricular tissues. the g protein gαo isoform  <dig> was found more abundant in the atria by both microarray and rt-pcr analyses and was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry to co-localize with anf in atrial granules and in the sarcolemma  <cit> . differential expression of the gβ and gγ subunit isoforms was also observed between the atria and ventricles but the functional significance of the differential g protein subunit diversity is not well known.

the identification of accessory proteins involved in the modulation of g protein signal transduction has helped to gain insight into the mechanisms involved in the specificity of a cellular response from an assortment of external stimuli. rgs proteins are capable of inhibiting signaling by acting as a gtpase accelerating/activating protein , which accelerate the intrinsic rate of gtp hydrolysis of the gαi/o subunit  <cit> . the preponderance of genes encoding for rgs proteins appears to be tissue specific. rgs <dig> and rgs <dig> were abundantly expressed in the atria while rgs <dig> was found at higher levels in the ventricles. these findings are confirmed by other studies in which rgs mrna and protein levels were measured within atrial and ventricular cardiocytes  <cit> .

in addition to the previously mentioned accessory proteins, in this work we identified the atrial specific transcript rasd <dig>  also known as ags <dig>  ags <dig> was found more abundant in the atria by both microarray and rt-pcr analyses. in the absence of receptor stimulation, ags <dig>  a member of the ras subgroup of small g proteins, specifically activates gi/o heterotrimeric signaling pathways by promoting nucleotide exchange on gαi/o proteins and enhancing gβγ uncoupling from gαi/o  <cit> . since stretch secretion coupling of anf and bnp is mediated by ptx-sensitive gαi/o, the differential expression of ags <dig>  as well as the other accessory proteins for g proteins identified in this investigation, is of particular interest. due to ags <dig> opposing effects on gi/o mediated signaling following agonist dependent or independent gpcr activation  <cit> , ags <dig> may help orchestrate the complex diversity and specificity of g protein signaling under different conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
the data developed in this investigation describes for the first time data on gene expression particularly centred on the secretory function of the heart. based on our data mining strategy, we narrowed down the list of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes to a group of  <dig> genes. additional data filtering generated a subset of  <dig> candidate genes, described herein, that are likely involved in the endocrine function of the heart. of special interest is the relationship between g proteins of the inhibitory type, as well as their accessory proteins, and members of the inward rectifiers and the two pore domain k+ channel superfamily. this investigation provides the basis of hypotheses formulation to further explore the endocrine function of the heart in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. several lines of investigation are being pursued in our laboratory based on the findings described herein.
