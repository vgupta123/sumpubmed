BACKGROUND
research interest in polygenic resistance to plant diseases has increased worldwide in the past ten years to meet the challenge of sustainable agriculture. recommendations to reduce chemical inputs and the frequent breakdown of major resistance genes in plants have encouraged the integration of polygenic resistance into cultivars of many crops. however, breeding strategies for polygenic resistance, which is controlled by many genes, have not been as widely developed as for monogenic or oligogenic resistance   <cit> . breeding schemes for polygenic traits are costly and time-consuming. the effects of quantitative trait loci  controlling resistance are not always conserved in different genetic backgrounds and environments and markers tightly linked to resistance loci have also often been lacking. further research is needed to validate qtl effects, reduce their confidence intervals  and identify their underlying causal genes  <cit> , to encourage and optimize qtl use in breeding  <cit> .

the identification of plant resistance qtl has broadly been explored using linkage mapping populations derived from crosses between two parental genotypes  <cit> . with the decrease in genotyping costs and the massive development of markers in the recent past years, genome-wide association  studies, are becoming common approaches to detect natural variation underlying complex traits, especially polygenic resistance to major diseases, in a large range of crop species , including legumes  <cit> . the advantages of gwa studies compared to bi-parental linkage mapping include access to wider genetic diversity, higher recombination rates due to the evolutionary history of the species, and thus substantially refined genomic regions associated with trait variations  <cit> . accurate marker density for gwa studies depends on the rate of linkage disequilibrium  decay and should be higher in species with a rapid ld decay  than in those with a slow ld decay   <cit> . segura et al.  <cit>  recently proposed a multi-locus mixed model  approach, in order to improve gwa studies precision and power of detection, and it was successfully applied  <cit> . the reduction of cis of genomic regions associated with traits of interest, opened the possibility of identifying haplotypes for marker assisted selection   <cit>  and pinpointing interesting candidate genes underlying qtl  <cit> . however, the gwa approach has also been reported to have poor power to detect rare alleles associated with the trait of interest, leading to missing heritability  <cit> , and complementarity between linkage and gwa approaches has been underlined  <cit> . multi-parental designs, including nested association mapping   <cit> , multi-parent advanced generation inter-cross   <cit>  and breeding line populations  <cit>  were proven to efficiently increase power of gwa studies to detect rare variants, for which rates are increased by selection of rare-allele-carrier parental lines  <cit> .

dry pea  is the third most important pulse crop worldwide  <cit> , for which yield has been unstable for the past decades, mainly due to biotic and abiotic stresses. one of the most damaging biotic stresses of peas is aphanomyces root rot due to aphanomyces euteiches  <cit> . the soil-borne root pathogen, first described in  <dig>  <cit> , has been mainly reported as a yield limiting factor in the united states of america  and europe for more than twenty years , and more recently in canada  <cit> . two main pathotypes of a. euteiches were described by wicker and rouxel  <cit> , including pathotype i predominant in france and pathotype iii detected in some regions of the usa . both pathotypes cause honey brown necrosis symptoms on pea roots and epicotyls, resulting in dwarfism, foliage yellowing and then death of plants in highly infested fields. increasing yield loss due to a. euteiches in dry and green pea production has been noted in western europe due to short crop rotations of susceptible pea varieties and the long lifespan of oospores  <cit> . the development of resistant cultivars has been considered as a major objective for the past two decades in france, as only prophylactic and cropping methods are available to manage the disease. pea lines partially resistant to a. euteiches were identified from germplasm screening and breeding programs conducted in the usa , and more recently, from a french germplasm screening program of approximately  <dig> pisum lines  <cit> . the most resistant lines were integrated into crossing programs to develop breeding lines  <cit> , recombinant inbred lines   and near-isogenic lines   <cit> . breeding lines with increased levels of resistance to a. euteiches were selected in a phenotypic recurrent selection-based breeding program developed by gsp   <cit> . rils have also been used for discovery of aphanomyces resistance qtl . a total of  <dig> meta-qtl were identified on a consensus genetic map from four ril populations  <cit> . eleven of them, corresponding to seven genomic regions, were detected on six of the seven pea linkage groups , with high consistency over locations, years, isolates and populations  <cit> . marker assisted back-crossing was used to introgress each of the seven consistent genomic regions into one of the susceptible ril parents and two main spring and winter pea varieties. the resulting nils were used to validate individual or combined major resistance qtl effects  <cit> . lavaud et al.  <cit>  considered large qtl intervals for nil creation, which brought undesirable morphological  or developmental  alleles linked to resistance alleles at several qtl.

massive numbers of single-nucleotide polymorphism  markers were recently developed from whole genome cdna   or genomic sequencing of pea lines  <cit> . a genopea infinium® beadchip was developed by tayeh et al.  <cit> , containing  <dig>  snps, all located in gene-context sequences. pea diversity panels, especially the usda  core collection and the inra  reference collection, were used to determine associations between low to medium density genetic markers  and traits of interest . however, only a few sources of resistance to a. euteiches were identified in these collections , as was also found in larger pisum screening programs for aphanomyces resistance  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to validate and refine the cis of previously reported aphanomyces resistance qtl, as well as identifying new resistance loci, using a gwa approach. a novel panel, enriched in pea lines partially resistant to a. euteiches from gene pools previously studied, was designed including breeding and germplasm lines  <cit> . the recent genopea infinium® beadchip was used for high-density snp genotyping of the collection  <cit> . the gwa study detected snps and ld blocks associated with aphanomyces resistance from data collected in nine field environments and two strains under controlled conditions. the genomic positions and cis of resistance loci detected by gwa study were compared to those previously identified by linkage analysis  <cit> . the gwa study also identified loci associated with morphological and developmental traits, in order to analyse their linkages with aphanomyces resistance loci. the gwa study allowed marker haplotypes and putative candidate genes to be identified, for future pyramiding of resistance alleles in breeding and to investigate the molecular basis of polygenic resistance.

methods
plant material
a collection of  <dig> pisum sativum lines, referred to as the “pea-aphanomyces collection", was used for association mapping. it includes cultivars, breeding lines and germplasm lines, supplied by public and private programs in legume genetics research and breeding : one hundred and one breeding lines, partially resistant or susceptible to a. euteiches, originating from the aphanomyces recurrent selection-based breeding program conducted by gsp  <cit> . the breeding scheme included four crossing programs , established from  <dig> to  <dig>  parental lines of the crosses included partially resistant germplasm lines confirmed in french field conditions   and dry spring or winter pea cultivars with good agronomic values but susceptible to the pathogen  <cit> . simple or double crosses between multiple parents were designed in the aea <dig>  aeb <dig> and aec <dig> programs.. the best f <dig> hybrids from the three programs were selected based on resistance levels of their inbred progenies . the selected f <dig> hybrids were then inter-crossed in the aed <dig> program which was divided into two parts. the first part  was generated from two crosses and aimed at developing pea lines with improved resistance levels for breeding purposes. the second part  was generated from three other crosses and was conducted as a divergent selection program of resistant and susceptible lines for qtl validation studies. in each of the four crossing programs, selection for resistance was conducted from f <dig> or f <dig> generations, alternatively in growth chamber and in french field nurseries. resistance levels and agronomic values of the best f <dig> and f <dig> lines were then assessed in infested field trials and in healthy field conditions.

 twenty rils from inra and usda research programs selected for aphanomyces resistance and for morphological and developmental traits. these rils included:  four lines from the baccara x pi <dig> ril population  <cit> ,  eight lines from the baccara x  <dig> ril population  <cit> , and  eight lines from the dark skin perfection  x 90- <dig> ril population  <cit> .

  eighteen parental lines of ril populations used for qtl analysis of aphanomyces resistance , and/or of the aphanomyces recurrent selection-based breeding program conducted by the gsp. these lines included the six pea differential genotypes defined by wicker et al.  <cit>  to verify disease severity and strain pathotypes in pathogenicity tests.

  twenty lines representing new sources of resistance, selected from the inra screening program of aphanomyces resistance sources previously conducted  <cit> . the new sources of resistance selected included pea breeding and germplasm lines from aphanomyces resistance screening programs in the usa and from collections of genetic resource centers in france, the netherlands, russia and the usa .

 sixteen spring or winter pea varieties currently or formerly grown in europe.



the pea-aphanomyces collection thus combined different genetic sources of resistance, especially originating from three major resistant pea lines effective in france  and analysed in previous qtl studies  <cit> . the collection included plant material described both for different end-uses  and for different sowing times . morphological descriptions  and available pedigree information of the lines are presented in additional file  <dig> 

phenotyping
the collection was evaluated for aphanomyces resistance in inoculated controlled conditions  and infested fields. in cc, resistance tests were performed in  <dig> on all the lines but the  <dig> rils with two pure-culture reference strains of a. euteiches described in  <cit> , i.e., the french rb <dig> strain from pathotype i and the american ae <dig> strain from pathotype iii. cc resistance tests were also conducted in  <dig> on all the lines with the rb <dig> strain only. the experiments used a modified version of the standardized test developed by moussart et al.  <cit> , as described in  <cit> . the pea lines were evaluated for resistance to each strain, using a randomised complete block design with four and three blocks in  <dig> and  <dig> tests, respectively, and five seeds per block sown in a pot. resistance tests were conducted in a growth chamber , as described in  <cit> . seven-day old seedlings were inoculated with a solution of  <dig> zoospores per plant, produced as described by moussart et al.  <cit> . disease severity was assessed on each plant seven days after inoculation, using a  <dig>  to  <dig>  scoring scale proportional to the percentage of browning symptoms on roots and epicotyls  <cit> . a cc root rot index  was calculated as the mean disease score on all plants in a pot.

in the field, the collection was evaluated for aphanomyces resistance in infested nurseries over four years  and three locations in france ; dijon-epoisses, côtes d’or  described in  <cit> ) and in the usa ). the collection was phenotyped each year at the two french locations and in  <dig> at ken, usa, for a total of nine environments. field assays were carried out using randomised complete block designs with three replicates and an adjacent susceptible control  every two lines, as described in  <cit> . two disease criteria were used to assess resistance in each plot, as reported in  <cit> :  a field root rot index , using the 0– <dig> cc scoring scale, evaluated on ten plants per plot for each year in french nurseries and  a field aerial decline index , measuring yellowing symptoms on a plot, evaluated once or twice  in all the usa and french disease nurseries, using a  <dig>  to  <dig> or  <dig>  disease scoring scale depending on the nursery. the rri and adi scores on each plot were adjusted for local disease variation measured by scores on the adjacent susceptible control, as described in  <cit> .

in the field, the collection was also phenotyped for developmental traits in a healthy nursery at rennes-le rheu ) for two years , using a randomised complete block design with three replicates, as described in  <cit> . earliness was scored on each plot as the number of calendar days to 50 % bloom , to 100 % bloom  and to ripening defined as 100 % of dried plants  from the first day of the year. average plant height  was evaluated on five plants per plot at 100 % bloom.

genotyping
the collection was genotyped using three morphological genes , specific-pcr markers for two known-function genes ,  <dig> simple sequence repeat  markers from  <cit>  and  <dig>  snp markers from  <cit> . dna was extracted from each pea line from approximately  <dig> g of young leaves collected on plants grown in a greenhouse, as described by doyle and doyle  <cit> . concentrations were adjusted to  <dig> ng/μl for ssr genotyping and to  <dig> ng/μl for snp genotyping.

ssr fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction  and analysed using genemapper® software v. <dig>  , as described in  <cit> , except for the  <dig> rils of the collection which were genotyped for ssrs as in  <cit> . out of the  <dig> ssrs,  <dig> and  <dig> were located within and outside the main genomic regions previously associated to aphanomyces resistance, respectively   <cit> . each ssr revealed between two and  <dig> alleles in the collection. each line of the collection was coded for each ssr allele as homozygous for the considered allele , heterozygous  or homozygous for another allele . a total of  <dig> ssr coded alleles were included in the genotyping matrix.

the  <dig>  snps were part of a large pea snp resource of  <dig>  robust filtered snps discovered from whole-genome illumina hiseq <dig> sequencing of  <dig> diverse pea genotypes  <cit> . these  <dig>  snps were all located in gene-context sequences, each originating from a separate transcript  <cit> , and were included in the illumina infinium® beadchip developed by tayeh et al.  <cit> . infinium genotyping and data analysis were conducted as described in tayeh et al.  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  snps were selected for clearly being bi-allelic in the collection. each line was coded “aa” or “bb” when homozygous for the first or second allele and “ab” when heterozygous.

statistical analysis of phenotypic data
phenotypic data obtained on the collection for resistance to a. euteiches, earliness and height were analysed, for each variable in each field environment or cc experiment , and then for all year x location field environments , using the r  <dig> . <dig> program  <cit> . in the individual analysis, phenotypic variables were analysed using a linear model   including g  and r  as fixed factors. in the global analyses, e  and gxe  interaction were added as fixed factors. normality of residuals and homogeneity of their variances were checked using skewness, kurtosis and shapiro-wilk statistics , as well as bartlett test , respectively . mean-based heritability  was calculated for each variable from variance estimates in the individual and global lm analysis, using the formulas h2 
= σg2/ and h2 
= σg2/, respectively, where σg <dig> is the genetic variance, σge <dig> the gxe interaction variance, σe <dig> the residual variance, e the number of environments and r the number of replicates per line. least square means  were calculated from each lm analysis . histograms of lsmeans frequency distributions were drawn using the r function hist.

pearson correlation analysis was carried out between lsmeans obtained from the individual and global analysis . the significance of the pearson correlations was evaluated with a false discovery rate correction for multiple testing . the heatmap of the pearson coefficients  was drawn using the r function heatmap. <dig>   <cit> .

a multiple factor analysis  was performed for the different resistance variable categories , using lsmeans from individual and global lm analysis . for mfa, lsmeans missing values were handled with the r package missmda  <cit> .

genetic analysis
the genotyping dataset of the collection, composed of three morphological genes, two specific-pcr markers for known-function genes,  <dig> ssr alleles and  <dig>  snp markers was filtered using plink  <dig>  software . six of the  <dig> pea lines with missing data for more than 10 % of snp markers were not included in the gwa analysis. markers with missing data that exceeded 10 % or with a minor allele frequency  that did not exceed 5 % in the  <dig> remaining lines, respectively, were also removed for the gwa analysis. a total of  <dig> markers, including three morphological genes, two specific-pcr markers of known-function genes,  <dig> ssr alleles and  <dig> snp markers were thus retained in the genetic analysis.

missing data imputation
the raw dataset of  <dig> snp markers was imputed using the r function knncatimputelarge . this function imputed missing values, which corresponded to  <dig>  % of the total dataset, regarding the k nearest neighbour snps without missing values. imputation parameters were tested with  <dig> replicates, using a subset of  <dig> snp of the dataset with no missing values. for each replicate,  <dig>  % of missing values were randomly simulated. parameters tested were one to  <dig> nearest neighbours and four different methods to determine distances between snps  <cit> . distance calculation methods were based on corrected pearson’s contingency coefficient, scaled manhattan distance, simple matching coefficient or cohen’s kappa. imputed values of simulated missing data were then compared to real values. the lowest error rate mean  over the  <dig> replicates was found with the cohen’s kappa distance calculation method and six nearest neighbours. these parameters were applied to the 9786-snp-markers and 189-ssr-allele dataset to impute missing values.

linkage disequilibrium analysis
pairwise ld between markers was explored within lgs from imputed genotypic data using plink  <dig>  software. obtained square correlation coefficient  values were then plotted against genetic distances  according to the consensus map from tayeh et al.  <cit> , namely tmap in this study, to estimate the ld decay. ld decay regression curves were fitted to the observed ld decay plots , following sved  <cit>  method with rexpected2 = 1/, ne effective population size and c recombination rate between two markers. a nonlinear model was fitted on the pairwise ld data, then least-squares estimates were computed  and ne was predicted from this fitted nonlinear model . the ld decay rate of the population was measured as the genetic distance  where the average r <dig> dropped to half its maximum value   <cit> .

population structure and individual relatedness
a principal component analysis  and a kinship relatedness matrix were used to estimate the structure of the collection from genotypic data, using the emma  method in the gapit  r package . pca and kinship matrices were calculated based on a subset of  <dig> snp markers, among the  <dig> imputed filtered markers on the tmap, corresponding to a single randomly-chosen marker per genetic position. regarding to eigenvalues, the three first principal components  of the pca were selected to take into account structure population in the gwa analysis. clustering of individuals was considered based on their kinship coordinates and was implemented in the gapit package with the upgma  method.

association mapping
gwa analyses were performed using a modified version of the multi-locus mixed model  r package  <cit> . briefly, the pca matrix of population structure and the kinship matrix obtained from gapit were defined as cofactors in the mlmm . significant snp markers were also used as cofactors in a forward/backward approach.

the initial script of mlmm_cof was modified to define the multiple-bonferroni  threshold using the formula: mbonf = , with α =  <dig> , the overall false positive threshold and m =  <dig>  the number of markers selected at non-redundant genetic positions on the tmap. thus, the mbonf threshold was set at  <dig> , which corresponded to a p-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  gwa study was performed from lsmeans scores of all the variables described in the phenotypic data analyses section, as well as from coordinates of lines on the two first pcs of mfa resistance variables analysis namely mfa.dim. <dig> and mfa.dim. <dig>  in each gwa analysis, the optimal mlmm step was determined as the largest stepwise mixed model regression in which all cofactors have –log  above the mbonf threshold defined. at the optimal mlmm step, reliability of the analysis was evaluated based on plot of mbonf criteria among forward and backward steps, qqplot at the optimal step with mbonf criteria, and plot of partition of variance among steps . the mlmm outputs used in this study were the partition of variance , the number and names of markers as cofactors at the optimal step and the p-value and allelic effect of each significant marker.

local ld analysis was used to define the cis around significant associated markers detected by gwa study using plink  <dig>  software. a ld block was determined as the interval containing all markers in ld  with the significant associated marker, as described in  <cit> . ld blocks were named with the lg name  and then an arabic numeral in genetic position order. a ld block was considered as consistent for each trait , when it contained either one marker associated with at least two variables of the trait, or two or more linked markers , each associated with at least one variable of the trait.

haplotype analysis
at each consistent ld block associated with aphanomyces resistance, marker haplotypes, i.e., genotypic patterns at the given ld block, were identified among all the lines of the collection based on non-imputed raw genotyping data. haplotypes were named with the ld block name and an arabic numeral. for each trait significantly associated with marker in a given consistent ld block, mean phenotypic scores of pea line groups comprising more than eight lines  and carrying different haplotypes were compared, using the tuckey-hsd test . favourable and unfavourable haplotypes were defined as those meeting the three following criteria:  carrying favourable and unfavourable allele, respectively, at the disease trait-associated marker,  without missing or heterozygous genotypic data at the other markers in the ld block and  showing a significantly lower or higher disease mean score  than the other favourable or unfavourable haplotypes, respectively, for the highest number of disease traits among those associated with the ld block. according to these criteria, more than one favourable or unfavourable haplotype per ld block could be defined. missing haplotypes were defined in lines showing missing genotypic data or heterozygosity for at least one marker in the considered ld block. each line of the collection was described for its number of favourable haplotypes at all the consistent ld blocks. a tukey-hsd test  was then used to compare the mean numbers of favourable haplotypes in three groups of pea lines without missing haplotypes. the three groups were defined based on their mfa.dim <dig> scores and corresponded to lines with high , intermediate  or low  levels of resistance, respectively.

comparative mapping
the consensus map from hamon et al.  <cit> , namely hmap in this study, summarized individual- and meta-qtl previously mapped for aphanomyces resistance and developmental traits  <cit> , while the consensus tmap of tayeh et al.  <cit>  contained all the markers used in the present study. thus, for comparative mapping, markers and qtl of the hmap were projected onto the tmap, using biomercator v <dig>  software  <cit> . the level of connectivity between the two maps was estimated using the “infomap” tool of the software. maps were compiled using the “iterative map projection” tool from biomercator v <dig>  based on loci position data. tmap was used as reference map and hmap was projected based on common loci. inversions of common loci were automatically resolved. visualization of loci detected by association and linkage mapping on the resulted consensus map  was computed using mapchart  <dig>  software  <cit> .

identification of putative candidate genes
using annotation data for snp anchored sequences from  <cit> , a search was carried out for the putative gene and protein functions contained in each ld block for resistance to a. euteiches, earliness and height. the annotation data described predicted protein functions for each transcript sequence. the annotation was obtained following blastx searches against p. sativum, m. truncatula, g. max and a. thaliana protein sequences. if at least two annotations were consistent, others missing, and at least one e-value was lower than 1e- <dig>  the corresponding putative protein function was assigned to the sequence underlying the snp. the putative annotation of the snp-anchored sequence was scored with a ‘disagreeing hits’ comment when annotations disagreed, and with a ‘not assigned’ comment when at least three annotations were missing and/or all e-values were higher than 1e- <dig> . when possible, putative protein functions were attributed to known mechanisms of plant development and responses to biotic stress, based on the literature. snps which were anchored to previously cloned pea genes and were located close to ld blocks associated with resistance or developmental variables were identified based on information provided in  <cit> .

RESULTS
analysis of phenotypic data
resistance to a. euteiches
global statistical analysis of rri and adi disease scores, obtained on the pea-aphanomyces collection in field infested nurseries over the nine environments studied, showed highly significant gxe interactions  . these results confirmed the relevance of data analysis in each environment. individual analysis of disease scores in each field environment, as well as in each cc experiment, revealed highly significant genotypic effects  for all the disease variables but for field_rri at ri in  <dig>  and field_adi <dig> at ri in  <dig>  . heritability of resistance ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , depending on the variable, and was high for most of the resistance variables . heritability values were especially high for cc_rri scorings , especially with the ae <dig> strain . frequency distributions of lsmeans values for each individual resistance variable tended to fit normal curves , except for cc_rri_09_ae <dig> which showed a skewed distribution with some highly resistant lines.

earliness and height
global statistical analysis of earliness and height scores, obtained on the collection in the field healthy nursery at ren over two years , showed highly significant gxe interactions  . individual analysis of the scores in each year revealed a highly significant genotypic effect . heritabilities of earliness and height traits in each environment were very high . frequency distributions of lsmeans values for each individual developmental variable tended to fit normal curves and were consistent between the two years .

correlations among variables
all field_rri and cc_rri scoring data were significantly and positively correlated between each other , as well as closely clustered, except that obtained with the ae <dig> strain . most of the field_adi data were slightly and positively correlated to cc_rri data  with the rb <dig> strain but not with the ae <dig> strain. most of the field_adi <dig> and field_adi <dig> scoring data  were also significantly and positively correlated between each other . field_adi scoring data were significantly and positively correlated with field_rri scoring data , except those from  <dig> .

all earliness and height data were significantly and positively correlated between each other  . earliness data were slightly and negatively correlated with most of the field_adi data .

multiple factors analysis
the two first pcs of the mfa analysis of disease resistance variables explained a total of 56 % of the inertia . three groups of variables could be distinguished, including cc_rri, field_rri and field_adi. a total of 77 % of the variables, especially the cc_rri_rb <dig> variables, were highly correlated with mfa.dim. <dig>  and well represented on the first axis  .fig.  <dig> graphical representation of multiple factors analysis  of the phenotypic data. correlation circle of variables   and genotype factor map  , on the first two principal components of the mfa of disease variables. earliness and height variables are supplemental variables and thus are projected onto the dimensions but were not included in the analysis. all the variables are abbreviated as described in table  <dig>  gsp0-3: lines from the gsp breeding program containing in their pedigree zero to three of the previously described major sources of resistance   <cit>  , respectively. parents: parental lines of gsp breeding programs and/or ril populations. brils iia, iib, iic: selected lines from the baccara x pi <dig>  baccara x  <dig> and dsp x 90– <dig> ril population, respectively; new sources: selected accessions from the large inra screening program; varieties: registered dry pea varieties. extreme genotypes are labelled on the two main principal components



pea lines with extreme negative or positive coordinates on mfa.dim. <dig> were considered as the most resistant or susceptible lines, respectively. mfa.dim. <dig> was mainly constructed from rb <dig> cc_rri variables  in contrast to field_adi variables . pea lines with extreme negative or positive coordinates on mfa.dim. <dig> had low levels of aerial symptoms or root symptoms, respectively. dispersion of the pea lines on the two principal mfa components showed that the frequency of resistant and susceptible lines was homogeneous among the collection and within some groups of lines , which is optimal for gwa analysis of the resistance. the three most resistant lines were gsp breeding lines, namely aed99osw −45-8- <dig> , aed99osw −50-2- <dig>  and aed99osw −47-6- <dig> . the two most susceptible lines were safranos  and marignan , registered as french varieties.

genetic analyses
linkage disequilibrium, structure, and kinship in the pea-aphanomyces collection
from the imputed genotypic data of the collection obtained with the filtered  <dig> markers, the ld decay was estimated to range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm, depending on the lg, and averaged  <dig>  cm over all the pea lgs . based on non-redundant marker positions on the consensus genetic map of tayeh et al.  <cit>  , the average distance between two markers used in the analysis was  <dig>  cm.

from the defined subset of  <dig> snps located at non-redundant genetic positions on the tmap, pca analysis of the collection identified three first pcs that explained a total of  <dig>  % of genetic variation in the collection . the first pc contributed to  <dig>  % of the variation and the second and third pcs to  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively. pea lines were clustered slightly on pcs  <dig> to  <dig> depending on their origin, mainly varieties, distinct ril populations, and groups of gsp breeding lines with any, two or three partially resistant parents in their pedigree . the first three pcs were added to the gwa model as cofactors to take into account this slight population structure. from the subset of  <dig> snps, the kinship matrix of genetic similarities revealed a moderate relatedness among lines of the collection , including sub-groups with higher relatedness  according to pedigree, end use or sowing type . thus, the kinship relatedness matrix was also added to the gwa model as a cofactor.

gwa markers and confidence intervals
disease resistance
gwa analysis identified a total of  <dig> markers, located on the seven lgs, associated with  <dig> global or individual aphanomyces resistance variables, including   <dig> field_rri or _adi variables from nine field environments,  the three cc_rri variables and  the two mfa variables . zero to nine markers were significantly associated with each variable, with a p-value that ranged from  <dig> e- <dig> to  <dig> e- <dig>  depending on the marker. zero to nine cofactors were thus retained in the mlmm for each disease resistance variable, explaining a total of zero to 68 % of the phenotypic variation depending on the variable and in accordance with the heritability of the trait. missing heritability  ranged from  <dig> to 85 % and pca and kinship individually captured between zero and 78 % of the variance, depending on the variable. allelic effects of markers associated with field_adi variables fluctuated widely, depending on the marker  . markers associated with field_rri had similar allelic effects as those associated with cc_ rri with the rb <dig> strain , but lower than those associated with cc_rri with the ae <dig> strain .table  <dig> genome-wide association analysis results using the multi-locus mixed model  method in the pea-aphanomyces collection

a total of  <dig> cis, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  cm, were defined around all the significant disease-trait-associated markers, which included markers in ld  with the targeted marker. three kinds of ld blocks were identified, based on their significance and consistency :  fourteen ld blocks were considered as consistent since these included two to six disease trait-associated markers .  four disease ld blocks included a single highly significant disease trait-associated marker . three of these markers were associated with cc_rri variables.  most of the disease ld blocks  included a single moderately significant disease-trait-associated marker .fig.  <dig> comparative genetic map of genome-wide association  and previously detected linkage quantitative trait loci . the comparative genetic map was constructed from the projection of the consensus map from hamon et al.  <cit>  onto the consensus map from tayeh et al.  <cit> . linkage groups  are named from i to vii and their size is indicated in cm haldane. resistance-, earliness- and height- associated markers, ld blocks and qtl are indicated in red, blue and black, respectively. to the right of each lg: names of significant trait-associated markers identified by gwa study are indicated. the shading in the lg bar represents the confidence intervals around the significant trait-associated markers, based on linkage disequilibrium  value of r

out of the  <dig> consistent ld blocks, seven were field_adi specific, three were field_rri specific and four were common to field_adi and _rri. the seven markers associated with global field_adi variables were all located in common ld blocks as individual field_adi variables. out of the two markers associated to the global field_rri variable, one was located in the same ld block as one containing individual field_rri variables. even if cc_rri and field_rri data were correlated , no common ld block was detected. among the four markers associated with mfa.dim. <dig>  two were included in field_rri specific ld blocks and one in a ld block that contained field_adi associated markers. the two markers associated with mfa.dim. <dig> variable were included in field_adi specific ld blocks.

the thmap, which resulted from the projection of the hmap onto the tmap, was based on  <dig> common markers , most of which were located in previous qtl regions. the projection led to a total of  <dig> inversions of marker positions, which did not likely affect the qtl projection.

comparison of linkage and association mapping results revealed that  <dig> of the  <dig> genomic regions including individual ae-ps qtl and  <dig> of the  <dig> mqtl-ae meta-qtl previously reported  <cit>  were also detected by association mapping .  eight out of the  <dig> consistent disease ld blocks  co-localized with four of the seven main ae-ps qtls previously identified and used for nils construction by lavaud et al.  <cit> , i.e., ae-ps <dig> , ae-ps <dig> , ae-ps <dig> a-b and ae-ps <dig> a-b. moreover, the highly consistent ld block vii. <dig> was located just  <dig>  cm away from ae-ps <dig> b. two other consistent ld blocks co-localized with two less consistent ae-ps qtl .  one of the four disease ld blocks including single highly significant disease-trait-associated markers  co-localized with the main previously detected qtl ae-ps <dig> .  among the  <dig> remaining disease ld blocks identified in this study, three co-localized with the previous main qtl ae-ps <dig>  and  <dig> were located in regions not previously reported for resistance to a. euteiches. the main qtl ae-ps <dig>  previously identified on lgv was not detected in this study.

linkage between resistance and morphological or developmental traits
a total of  <dig> markers, distributed over four lgs, were significantly associated  with the six earliness variables scored in the pea-aphanomyces collection in the ren healthy field nursery over two years . twenty ld blocks were defined around earliness-associated markers, covering  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm. six were consistent, since they were associated with two to six variables, and had different allelic effects ranging from one to  <dig>  days . three ld blocks were not consistent but included highly significant single trait-associated markers and had high allelic effects from  <dig>  to  <dig>  days . three of the  <dig> qtl previously identified in hamon et al.  for earliness, i.e., flo-ps <dig> , flo-ps <dig>  and flo-ps <dig> , were also detected by association mapping.

a total of five markers, corresponding to three ld blocks distributed over two lgs, were significantly associated with the two height variables scored . two ld blocks  on lgiii and lgvii, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm, were consistent, since they each included two height-associated markers. in particular, ld block iii. <dig> was highly significant  and presented an allelic effect which contributed to height differences of more than  <dig> cm. none of the three ld blocks co-localized with previous qtl detected for height in  <cit>  .

out of the total  <dig> ld blocks identified for resistance to a. euteiches, earliness and height, only five  were detected for both resistance and earliness, and one  for both resistance and height . in the five resistance and earliness common ld blocks, three snp markers and one ssr marker  were associated with both resistance and earliness. allelic effects at these markers were opposing for resistance and earliness, i.e., the resistance-enhancing alleles conferred later bloom.

one ld block identified for resistance to a. euteiches also co-localized with the af morphological gene which controls leaf type on lgi. no ld block co-localized with the a morphological gene  which control anthocyanin production on lgii. linkage between aphanomyces resistance and normal leaves at the ae-ps <dig>  qtl reported in  <cit>  was thus confirmed, while linkage between resistance and coloured flowers at the ae-ps <dig>  qtl was broken.

marker haplotypes
at each of the  <dig> consistent disease ld blocks, three to  <dig> haplotypes were identified, depending on the ld block . mean comparison of phenotypic lsmeans between marker haplotype groups of a ld block, allowed one or two favourable haplotypes per ld block to be selected, except at ld block iv. <dig> for which four favourable haplotypes were identified. a total of  <dig> favourable haplotypes were identified over the  <dig> consistent disease resistance ld blocks. a total of  <dig> haplotypes, carrying at least one favourable allele at the disease-trait-associated marker of the blocks, were also identified among the  <dig> consistent disease resistance ld blocks. in a subset of  <dig> lines without missing haplotypes, the 25 % most resistant lines, according to mfa.dim. <dig> coordinates, showed a mean frequency of favourable haplotypes which was significantly higher  than that of the lines classified in the intermediate or susceptible groups  . lines aed99osw-49-5- <dig> , aed99osw-45-8- <dig>  and aed99osw-37-3- <dig>  showed the highest number of favourable haplotypes defined  at the  <dig> consistent disease ld blocks in the subset of  <dig> lines. the group of susceptible lines carried the highest number of unfavourable haplotypes . two of the favourable haplotypes for resistance to a. euteiches  were the worst haplotypes for earliness as it gave the latest flowering time. another one  was unfavourable for earliness as it gave intermediate flowering time. one of the favourable haplotypes for resistance to a. euteiches  was unfavourable for plant height as it gave higher plants. early bloom and small height are two important selection criteria in dry pea breeding programs.fig.  <dig> mean comparison of favourable haplotype numbers in resistant, intermediate and susceptible lines. a: box plot of the number of favourable linkage disequilibrium  block haplotypes carried by pea lines  from the pea-aphanomyces collection belonging to the first quartile , interquartile  and third quartile  of coordinates on the first principal component of the multiple factors analysis . the three groups include pea lines with a high , intermediate  and low  level of resistance. letters indicate significantly different groups based on mean comparison . b: distribution histogram of mfa.dim. <dig> for the pea lines  of the collection. the first quartile  carries the highest number of favourable haplotypes, the interquartile  carries an intermediate number of favourable haplotypes and the third quartile  carries the lowest number of favourable haplotypes



putative candidate genes
out of the  <dig> markers in the  <dig> disease-related ld blocks,  <dig> were located in gene sequences and could be assigned to putative protein functions . out of these  <dig> annotated snps,  <dig> snps corresponded to genes with putative functions reported to be involved in plant response to biotic stresses. among these genes,  <dig> encode for protein domains reported as involved in plant recognition of pathogens ,  <dig> for domains reported to contribute to signal transduction ,  <dig> for proteins playing a role in transcription regulation  and  <dig> for proteins involved in plant defence responses such as cell wall modifications , oxidative burst , detoxification  or cell death . a subset of  <dig> putative proteins were also reported to be involved in plant growth or development, out of which  <dig> were not reported to be related to pathogen resistance. four disease-trait-associated markers in ld blocks iii. <dig>  iv. <dig>  v. <dig> and vi. <dig>  were close to  but not in ld with pea resistance genes analogues  coding for nucleotide binding site leucine rich repeat  proteins   <cit> . three rri-associated markers in ld blocks iii. <dig>  iv. <dig> and vii. <dig>  and one field_adi-associated marker in ld block vi. <dig>  were close  to cloned genes involved in pea-rhizobia symbiosis . a field_adi- associated marker in ld block i. <dig> co-localized with the sgr gene  which controls chlorophyll catabolism during foliage senescence  <cit> . among the  <dig> consistent or significant disease-related ld blocks,  <dig> snp markers were attributed to putative sequences coding for interesting candidate proteins involved in plant resistance to pathogens, including leucine-rich repeats  in ld blocks i. <dig>  iv. <dig> and vii. <dig>  serine/threonine protein kinases in six ld blocks  <cit>  and an abc transporter  <cit>  in ld block iii. <dig> 

among the  <dig> additional ld blocks exclusively related to earliness,  <dig> of the  <dig> snp markers could be assigned to a putative function,  <dig> of which are involved in plant growth or development. three earliness-associated markers in ld blocks ii. <dig>  iii. <dig> and iii. <dig>  were close  to cloned genes involved in flowering time or indeterminacy  . among the three height-related ld blocks,  <dig> of the  <dig> snp markers could be assigned to a function. eight of them were reported to be involved in plant growth and development, including two snps in ld blocks iii. <dig> and iii. <dig> designed in sequences of pea cloned genes controlling plant height, i.e., la   <cit>  and le   <cit> , respectively. the height-associated markers in the third height-related ld block vii. <dig> was located just  <dig>  cm from the snp marker designed in the sequence of the cry gene, involved in plant growth  <cit> .

discussion
this work describes the first gwa approach in pea to decipher polygenic control of partial resistance to a. euteiches, using novel plant material as well as high density and quality genomic resources. the study evaluated a pea-aphanomyces collection of  <dig> lines, enriched in sources of resistance to a. euteiches, which were identified in the last 15-years of research and breeding programs. genetic diversity and recombination events screened in the collection were higher than those previously studied in bi-parental populations. we took advantage of the genopea infinium ® beadchip recently generated  <cit> , containing  <dig>  snps precisely anchored onto a consensus genetic map generated from genotyping data on more than  <dig> rils. this novel genomic resource greatly enhanced the resolution of the genetic analysis in the association mapping collection compared to the few hundred genetic markers used in previous linkage studies of aphanomyces resistance in pea  <cit> . we used the same resistance phenotyping methodologies and aphanomyces field network as in the previous qtl analysis of resistance, which led to high accuracy when comparing the results of these two approaches. finally, this study used a mlmm to perform gwa study. this model corrects for population structure and individual relatedness, and takes into account significantly associated snps as cofactors to detect other snps. this approach limits the number of false positive and false negative associations  <cit> .

specifically, the gwa study  identified  <dig> consistent loci out of a total of  <dig> small sized ld-based cis detected for resistance to a. euteiches;  validated and refined six of the seven major resistance qtl previously identified;  confirmed or broke negative associations with morphological and developmental loci;  pinpointed interesting haplotypes and determined their frequency in the most resistance pea lines, for application in breeding;  identified relevant and interesting putative candidate genes underlying main resistance loci.

gwa study validated most of the previously detected qtl and identified new resistance loci
this study validated most of the previously detected aphanomyces resistance qtl in pea. out of the  <dig> resistance-associated loci,  <dig> were estimated to be located in  <dig> of the  <dig> projected ae-ps qtl, including six of the seven main consistent qtl, and  <dig> of the  <dig> projected meta-qtl  previously identified from bi-parental population studies  <cit> . four and two of the main previously consistent resistance qtl  were re-detected in this study by eight of the  <dig> consistent resistance loci and seven of the other single-variable specific loci, respectively. twelve previously detected minor-effect qtl were also confirmed with  <dig> resistance-associated loci, including two that were consistently detected. gwa validation of previous linkage resistance qtl was expected, as the pea-aphanomyces collection was enriched in genetic pools derived from sources of resistance studied in previous qtl analysis . a total of 87 % of the  <dig> gsp breeding lines and rils of the collection were derived from at least one of these three sources of resistance. in crops, gwa studies usually used panels with a good representation of species genetic diversity, such as diversity collections developed in pea  <cit> . for pea aphanomyces resistance, the gwa study required an adapted panel with a higher resistance allele frequency than to the one previously observed in the pea natural genetic variation   <cit> . however, kwon et al.  <cit>  identified a ssr marker  associated to aphanomyces resistance  <cit>  in the usda pea core-collection, which is estimated to be located in the ae-ps <dig>  qtl region, close to ld block vii. <dig>  using comparative genetic maps  <cit> . marker and methodology tools were also used to optimize comparative analysis of gwa and previous linkage results. most of the ssr markers, previously associated with resistance qtl  <cit> , were integrated into the consensus snp genetic map of tayeh et al.  <cit> . common markers were used as bridges for comparative mapping through linkage qtl projection. furthermore, the field and climate chamber conditions were the same in  <cit>  and in this study, which increased the accuracy of comparative mapping.

eight of the  <dig> projected ae-ps qtl previously associated with the resistance  <cit>  were not identified by gwa in this study, including one main consistent qtl . several factors could lead to non-validation of qtl by gwa. these include the low detection power of minor-effect qtl, low allele frequency, gxe interactions, epistatic interactions and gaps in marker coverage  <cit> . in this study, the detection power of low effect qtl may have not been optimal due to the moderate population size . markers with low maf  were sometimes clustered in some genomic regions, such as on lgv, and were removed from the analysis, creating gaps in the genome-wide scan of marker-trait associations. gxe interactions for field aphanomyces resistance were observed in this study over the nine environments tested, as previously reported and discussed regarding pedo-climatic conditions, pathogen diversity and the presence of other root rot pathogens  <cit> . they may have resulted in the detection of qtl specific to the field environments presently studied compared to previous ones, which were submitted to different climatic conditions and pathogen population pressures. epistatic interactions have also been reported for aphanomyces resistance  <cit>  and some qtl effects were recently shown to increase or be lost when transferred into a new genetic background  <cit> . finally, despite the unprecedented marker density used in gwa analysis in pea, marker coverage gaps cannot be excluded, due to the restricted choice of snps in the infinium snp chip used and the unavailable information on physical distances between markers. the non-detection of the main consistent qtl ae-ps <dig>  was particularly unexpected since it was identified from cc experiments with several strains including rb <dig> and ae <dig> used in this study, and contributed up to 38 % of the phenotypic variation in the dsp x 90– <dig> ril population  <cit> . however, lavaud et al.  <cit>  recently showed that the effect of ae-ps <dig>  was lost when transferred into pea lines other than dsp, suggesting epistatic interactions between this qtl and genetic background. in addition, a very low allele frequency was observed for the snp designed in the ae-ps <dig>  closely linked marker psld   <cit>  and for its neighbour snp in high ld , which were both consequently removed from the analysis.

in this study  <dig> new aphanomyces resistance loci were identified, including three consistent ones . comparative mapping was based on few markers  which resulted in some inversions. thus, some projection inaccuracies may have wrongly pointed out these loci as new ones, especially for the vii. <dig> interval. however, the higher resolution of gwa analysis may also have highlighted resistance alleles from the studied germplasm, which would not have been previously detected due to low marker coverage. most probably, new favourable alleles are present in the pea-aphanomyces collection, which included new sources of resistance  <cit>  which were not investigated in previous linkage-qtl analyses.

in other pathosystems, gwa mapping often validated linkage mapping qtl and detected new loci. for example, samayoa et al.  <cit>  and zhao et al.  <cit>  reported similar results when comparing linkage and association mapping of mediterranean corn borer resistance in maize and sclerotinia sclerotinium resistance in soybean, respectively.

gwa study detected resistance loci with a higher resolution than in previous linkage mapping studies
in the present gwa study, qtl resolution increased compared to previous linkage mapping studies of aphanomyces resistance. the  <dig> resistance-associated intervals were detected with much smaller sizes  than those previously identified in qtl mapping studies . the ld decay rate in the pea-aphanomyces collection was low  compared to the one observed in a similar study in pea  <cit>  . this low ld decay rate is particularly interesting as ld decay of autogamous  species have generally been reported slow , as in rice, foxtail millet or soybean, compared to outcrossing species   <cit> . this may be especially due to a high number of recombination events in the breeding lines coming from the gsp recurrent selection program , which were mainly derived from double crosses between multiple parents . the average distance between two adjacent marker positions of the tmap considered in this study  was higher than the ld decay rate. since marker genetic positions may not have covered all the putative recombination points in the collection, there is still the potential to increase genotyping density of the collection, to improve qtl detection resolution. previous meta-qtl analysis of aphanomyces resistance attempted to reduce qtl cis but this reduction was potentially over-estimated because of the only partial independence on populations and environments compared  <cit> . the mlmm model recently proposed by segura et al.  <cit> , used cofactors that captured background genetic variance during genome scan to improve the precision of cofactor detection as found in composite interval mapping.

comparative analyses of the qtl detected by linkage and association studies are often not carried out on comparable genetic distance scales in both studies. consequently, several association mapping loci could correspond to a single qtl interval identified by linkage mapping. ingvarsson & street  <cit>  reported frequent splitting of linkage mapping intervals into much smaller association mapping intervals. split association mapping intervals involved in a same larger linkage mapping interval could correspond to several linked genes controlling the trait or to a single imprecisely located region due to gxe effects on the phenotype. our findings suggest linkage between multiple genes hypothesis when closely located ld blocks were detected from different variables, as seen for example for the ae-ps <dig>  region on lgvii . in other cases the results were consistent with single genes hypothesis when neighbouring blocks were detected for the same type of variable, as in the ae-ps <dig>  region on lgiii .

gwa study provides new tools for pyramiding aphanomyces resistance alleles in breeding programs
this study identified marker haplotypes at consistent aphanomyces resistance loci, the pyramiding of which was associated with increased levels of partial resistance in pea lines of the collection. at the  <dig> consistent ld blocks identified,  <dig> favourable haplotypes carrying the favourable alleles at disease trait-associated markers were significantly associated with enhanced resistance levels. the highest resistant lines of the pea-aphanomyces collection carried a significantly higher number of favourable haplotypes. the five most resistant lines with no missing haplotypes were breeding lines from the aed99osw gsp program, all derived from direct crosses between the three most partially resistant germplasm studied in previous qtl analysis . these five breeding lines had a higher level of partial resistance than their individual parents. they combined between eight and  <dig> of the favourable haplotypes selected at the  <dig> consistent resistance loci, whereas each of their single parental lines combined between three to nine favourable haplotypes. from this study, different combinations of haplotypes seemed to be related to enhanced levels of resistance. the best combinations were quite difficult to identify since they could vary depending on the lines. however, the favourable haplotypes defined at several blocks  appeared to be frequently represented in the most resistant lines.

our findings suggested that the pyramiding of aphanomyces resistance alleles with moderate to low effects is a powerful strategy to develop pea lines with increased levels of partial resistance to a. euteiches. in the past  <dig> years, such a pyramiding strategy, based on phenotypic recurrent selection schemes, was successfully developed for root rot diseases in public usa pea breeding programs  <cit> . in particular, lewis and gritton  <cit>  developed a phenotypic recurrent selection protocol consisting of one cycle per year, including selection of f <dig> lines on aerial symptoms of the plants in an infested field nursery, followed by intercrosses and selfing of the best lines. the  <dig> germplasm line was selected from the eighth cycle of recurrent selection , suggesting that this line accumulated resistance alleles. accumulation of resistance alleles in the  <dig> germplasm line was demonstrated in this study . more recently, lavaud et al.  <cit>  reported that the combination of two or three of the main consistent aphanomyces resistance qtl identified in  <cit>  could increase the partial resistance level, depending on genetic backgrounds. in several other pathosystems, combinations of resistance alleles were shown to successfully enhance resistance levels, including stem rust resistance in wheat  <cit> , spot leaf diseases resistance in spring wheat  <cit>  and spot blotch resistance in barley  <cit> .

we also identified negative linkages between resistance and morphological or developmental alleles, to be considered with caution for application in dry pea breeding. undesirable linkages were previously reported between aphanomyces resistance and coloured flowers, long internodes, normal leaves and late-flowering  <cit> , and have been avoided in breeding programs  <cit> . in the present study, associations were highlighted between resistance and late flowering alleles at markers in the consistent disease ld blocks vii. <dig>  vii. <dig> and vii. <dig>  in non-consistent disease ld blocks, undesirable links were also highlighted between resistance and normal leaves  or late flowering . in contrast, high resolution of association mapping in this study also enabled linkage between resistance and coloured flowers  alleles to be broken in the genomic region corresponding to the previous main resistance qtl ae-ps <dig>  . thus, different pea lines of the collection carrying favourable haplotypes in the ld block ii. <dig> have white flowers. however, in the most resistant lines of the collection, such as aed99osw- 45-8- <dig>  some negative associations could not be broken, as those lines presented normal leaves and some of them still had coloured flowers. due to the high resolution of gwa study, we could also hypothesize that loci controlling resistance and delayed leaf senescence   <cit>  in the ld block i. <dig> are distinct since they were not in ld . morphological and developmental-trait-loci which are not associated with aphanomyces resistance could also be detected, suggesting that resistance could be improved without including undesirable traits. for height and earliness, the height locus iii. <dig> on the le gene and the earliness loci ii. <dig>  ii. <dig>  ii. <dig>  vii. <dig> and vii. <dig> were identified and not associated with resistance loci. genetic associations between plant disease resistance and undesired developmental traits such as late-flowering have been commonly reported in the literature  <cit> . association genetic studies could have confirmed such negative linkages  <cit>  but sometimes allowed them to be broken, as observed in our study

gwa study identified relevant putative candidate genes underlying aphanomyces resistance qtl
the high resolution of the present association mapping study and the recent availability of pea transcriptome sequences connected to the  <dig>  snps used in this study, constitute unprecedented advantages for identifying putative candidate genes underlying aphanomyces resistance qtl. indeed, the detection of plant height qtl in previously cloned genes involved in plant growth, and the proximity of flowering genes to earliness ld blocks suggests that the resolution of the present gwa study was high enough to pinpoint relevant candidate genes.

gwa study identified a high frequency  of putative candidate genes corresponding to a diversity of stress-related protein functions, underlying resistance-associated intervals. to date, the low number of resistance qtl cloned suggested that the molecular functions underlying them could be diverse  <cit> . hypothetical gene-encoded proteins underlying resistance qtl included genes involved in plant-pathogen recognition, signal transduction, activation or repression of transcription, defence responses and developmental or morphological modifications with pleiotropic effects. such a diverse range of genes underlying resistance intervals was also identified in this study. putative candidate genes underlying major effect qtl ae-ps <dig> - <dig> , recently validated for pea resistance to the american a. euteiches strain ae <dig>  <cit>  , included basic helix-loop-helix  and ethylene-responsive transcription factors and a nbs-lrr. a second main effect qtl ae-ps <dig> , validated for pea resistance to the french a. euteiches strain rb <dig> , included two putative infection-induced proteins. some different types of putative stress-related genes clustered in the disease ld blocks identified in this study and thus may be strong candidates for underlying one of the known mechanisms. for example, ld blocks iii. <dig> and i. <dig> contained six and four putative candidate genes, respectively, involved in mechanisms of pathogen recognition, transcription regulation, signal transduction and/or defence response.

other ld blocks seemed to be interesting as they are very close to nbs-lrr cloned genes , however they were detected in single environments and had moderate effects. genes encoding nbs-lrr protein domains are known to be clustered in crop genomes, such as described in medicago truncatula  <cit> , since they are known to be subjected to rapid evolution through local duplications. in pea, tayeh et al.  <cit>  recently reported a large cluster of  <dig> nbs-resistance-like genes at the bottom of lgiii. this genomic region, including snp markers assigned to these  <dig> nbs-like genes, co-localized with disease ld block iii. <dig> and is close to consistent ld block iii. <dig> identified in this study.

some disease ld blocks contained putative genes similar to those underlying disease resistance qtl cloned in plants, such as abc transporters  and nbs-lrr proteins ). an abc transporter protein have been shown to underlie the lr <dig> major qtl controlling durable resistance to leaf rust stripe rust and powdery mildew in wheat  <cit> . other ld blocks could also be detected close to cloned symbiosis genes , suggesting possible common mechanisms between plant-pathogens and plant-beneficial organisms interactions  <cit> . some ld blocks also included plant or root development genes , suggesting their involvement in disease resistance, tolerance or avoidance as reported for several pathosystems  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present gwa study, most of the previously identified aphanomyces resistance qtl were validated with a finer resolution than before, by taking advantage of the new plant and genomic resources developed in pea. new points of discussion were raised regarding comparison of association and linkage analysis to dissect polygenic disease resistances in plants. this study provides new tools for breeding, including pea germplasm and snp markers associated with resistance, as well as useful information about marker haplotypes at main resistance loci and undesirable allele linkages with resistance. it demonstrates that pyramiding resistance alleles is a key strategy for increasing levels of partial resistance to aphanomyces root rot in pea. the choice of resistance loci to be pyramided remains to be explored, especially using nils  <cit> . this study also identified relevant candidate genes to be confirmed and validated in future studies. these will benefit from further genomic resources in progress, developed in part from a complete pea reference genome sequence becoming available, for increasing resolution of the gwa study.
