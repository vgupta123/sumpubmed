BACKGROUND
β-mannans  are abundant polysaccharides playing diverse roles in plants including energy storage in seed endosperms, e.g. carob and guar seeds, legumes, coconuts and coffee beans  <cit> , or structural support in the hemicellulose cell wall matrix  <cit> , where they can constitute up to 25 % of the dry mass in softwood. the biochemical details of enzymatic mannan depolymerization have received increasing attention in recent years due to wide interest within the biofuel and biorefinery areas  <cit> . mannans, however, are also present in human nutrition, either as cell wall components in cereal grains and some fruits and vegetables such as kiwi, apple and tomato  or as common hydrocolloid food additives used as thickeners or to adjust texture  <cit> . mannans are not known to be hydrolyzed by human digestive enzymes and thus offer a potential resource to mannanolytic gut bacteria. the fermentation of guar gum  galactomannan has been demonstrated in the human gut  <cit>  and intake of partial hydrolysates of this polysaccharide stimulated the proliferation of bifidobacterium spp. in humans  <cit>  and mice  <cit> . however, insight into the microbial strategies and enzymes mediating mannan degradation in the human gut lags behind.

mannans occur as insoluble crystalline polymers of β- <dig> -linked mannosyl residues in seeds, such as ivory nut mannan  or as soluble heteropolymeric glucomannans consisting of alternating β- <dig> -linked glucosyl and mannosyl backbone e.g. in corms of amorphophallus konjac. mannan can be substituted to different degrees with α- <dig> -linked galactosyl sidechains as in carob  and guar gums and in glucomannan from softwood, which also has acetyl decorations  <cit> . konjac glucomannan , locust bean  and gg galactomannans are the main mannans used as food additives  <cit> .

the concerted action of several backbone- and sidechain-degrading enzymes is required for depolymerization of mannans. the precise number of enzymatic activities varies with the substrate structure, but endo-β- <dig> -mannanases  that hydrolyze internal backbone β- <dig> -linkages are central in mannan degradation. β-mannanases are assigned in glycoside hydrolase  families  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the carbohydrate-active enzymes  database  <cit> . many bacterial mannanases cluster in subfamily  <dig> of gh <dig>  according to a phylogeny-based assignment  <cit> . mannanases of gh <dig> employ a double displacement mechanism with the retention of anomeric configuration  <cit> . some mannanases contain carbohydrate-binding modules  that have been ascribed diverse roles including targeting enzymes to polysaccharides, increasing the local substrate concentration, or conferring processivity  <cit> .

the present study focuses on the widely utilized and clinically well-documented probiotic bacterium bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bl- <dig>  <cit> . genome analysis identified a gene encoding a mannanase comprising a gh <dig> catalytic module joined to a cbm <dig>  members of cbm <dig> were previously found to bind to insoluble microcrystalline cellulose  <cit>  and insoluble mannan  <cit> . furthermore, we show that the gh <dig> mannanase  from bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bl- <dig>  which is conserved within bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, displays the highest catalytic efficiency reported to date for a gh <dig> β-mannanase owing to a combination of very high kcat and low km. the cbm <dig> of this enzyme is the first described low-affinity mannan binding module and it forms a novel cbm <dig> subfamily together with close homologues. the distinct differences in the biochemical properties of this enzyme as compared to characterized β-mannanases from gut microbiota illustrate the diversity of mannan utilization strategies, which is likely to be important in adaptation to the highly competitive gut niche.

the conformational stability of  <dig>  μm blman5_ <dig> in 10 mm mes buffer, ph  <dig>  was assessed using differential scanning calorimetry  between 15 °c and 90 °c at 1 °c · min− <dig> in a microcal vp-dsc calorimeter. the enzyme was scanned twice with cooling and pre-equilibration in between to assess the reversibility of thermal transitions. the dialysis buffer was used as a reference and the reference and baseline corrected thermograms were analyzed using origin <dig> with a dsc add-on provided with the instrument.

binding to polysaccharides and oligosaccharides
qualitative screening of binding of blman5_ <dig> and blman5_8-Δcbm <dig> to soluble polysaccharides was analysed using affinity electrophoresis as previously described  <cit> . the electrophoretic separation of 2 μg of either protein was performed at 4 °c and 45 v for 20 h in 50 mm tris-borate, ph  <dig>  and in 12 % polyacrylamide gels without  or with  <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig>  g · l− <dig> kgm, as well as  <dig>  g · l− <dig> hydroxyethyl cellulose . quantitative binding analysis of blman5_ <dig> and blman5_8-Δcbm <dig> to lbg-lv was done using affinity electrophoresis  <cit>  at 100 v for 4 h in gels without  or with  <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig>  g · l− <dig> lbg-lv, as described above. the apparent dissociation constant  for lbg-lv was calculated by nonlinear regression using prism  <dig> . binding to insoluble inm and avicel was measured by adding 50 μl of appropriately diluted enzyme to 400 μl of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> or 100 g · l− <dig> of either substrate suspended in standard assay buffer. the slurry was incubated at 4 °c for 1 h with gentle shaking, centrifuged at  <dig> 000 × g for 10 min and the mannanase activity in the supernatant was assayed as described above.

surface plasmon resonance  analysis was performed using a biacore t <dig>  to assess binding to manno-oligosaccharides and cellotetraose. enzymes diluted to 40 μg · ml− <dig> in 10 mm sodium acetate, ph  <dig> , were immobilized onto a cm <dig> chip  using a standard amine coupling protocol to a density of  <dig> and  <dig> response units  for blman5_ <dig> or blman5_8-Δcbm <dig>  respectively. binding analysis was performed in triplicates at 25 °c in 10 mm mes, 150 mm nacl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig>  %  p <dig>  running buffer at 30 μl · min− <dig> with association and dissociation times of  <dig> and 30 s, respectively, at seven concentrations of m <dig> , m <dig> , m <dig>  and cellotetraose . a one-binding-site model was fit to the blank and reference cell-corrected steady state response data to determine the dissociation constant kd and the saturation binding level rmax, which was used to estimate the molar stoichiometry   <cit>  of oligosaccharide binding to immobilized enzymes that retain binding activity.

action pattern analysis using mannopentaose
for analysis of the productive binding modes of m <dig>  enzymatic reactions were carried out in 18o labeled water , as described  <cit>  at 8 °c with 1 mm m <dig> and  <dig> nm blman5_ <dig> in 1 mm sodium phosphate, ph  <dig>  in 93 % h218o. samples were incubated for 0 − 24 h and analyzed with maldi-tof ms. aliquots of  <dig>  μl were withdrawn at each time point, spotted directly on a maldi plate, covered with  <dig>  μl matrix  in water) and dried under warm air. this analysis combined with hpaec-pad quantification of m <dig> and m <dig> products of m <dig> hydrolysis was used to determine the frequency of productive binding modes of m <dig> as previously described  <cit> .

transglycosylation product formation from m5
for analysis of transglycosylation 5 mm m <dig> was incubated with  <dig>  nm blman5_ <dig> in standard assay buffer for 0–24 h. samples were analyzed with maldi-tof ms as described above.

sequence analyses and homology modeling
the sequence of blman5_ <dig> was analyzed to identify catalytic and ancillary modules using dbcan  <cit> , a cazy-based database  <cit>  for automated carbohydrate-active enzyme annotation. the sequence of the blman5_ <dig> catalytic module was aligned with  <dig> sequences listed as gh5_ <dig> in cazy  <cit> , as well as  <dig> characterized β-mannanases from gh <dig> subfamilies  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  using mafft  <dig>  <cit> . the cbm <dig> of blman5_ <dig> was aligned with  <dig> predicted cbm <dig> sequences retrieved using dbcan, after removing two sequences that appeared fragmented and three sequences that displayed e-values above  <dig> . these sequences were aligned using mafft  <dig> and a phylogenetic tree was calculated using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean using standard settings accessed on the cbrc server  and rendered using dendroscope  <dig>  <cit> . the crystal structure of the thermobifida fusca mannanase tfman5a   <cit>  served as template to model the 39 % amino acid sequence identical catalytic module of blman5_ <dig>  using modeller  <cit> . the homology model was evaluated with molprobity  <cit> , showing that  <dig>  % of all residues were in ramachandran favored regions. the model had a clash score of  <dig> , defined as the number of unfavorable  steric overlaps per  <dig> atoms  <cit> . evaluation with proq  <cit>  gave a predicted lgscore of  <dig>  and a predicted maxsub of  <dig> , indicating good model quality.

RESULTS
basic properties of blman5_8
blman5_ <dig> is predicted to be an extracellular modular β-mannanase comprising a catalytic module of glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> subfamily  <dig>  joined to a c-terminal carbohydrate-binding module of family  <dig>  by a typical linker sequence plausibly starting from gly <dig> to gly <dig> . the position of the truncation  was chosen as to avoid destabilisation of the catalytic module due to possible loss of interactions with the first few residues in the linker. the full-length blman5a and the truncated blman5_8-Δcbm <dig> were produced and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. both enzyme forms migrated in accord with their theoretical molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda, respectively. the lack of activity towards microcrystalline cellulose  and the high activity towards mannans  confirmed the β-mannanase specificity of blman5_ <dig> table  <dig> specific activity of blman5_ <dig> towards soluble and insoluble polysaccharides

product profiles, transglycosylation and productive binding frequency analysis
the hydrolysis profiles of lbg and inm by blman5_ <dig> and blman5_8-Δcbm <dig> were analyzed using hpaec-pad. both enzyme variants produced m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> as the main initial hydrolysis products from both lbg and inm, along with some mannobiose  . the main products of blman5_ <dig> from m <dig> were m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig>  the formation of 10-fold higher m <dig> compared to mannose   is indicative of transglycosylation activity, which was supported by the detection of mannohexaose , mannoheptaose  and mannooctaose  transglycosylation products by mass-spectrometry following incubation with m <dig> . all four productive m <dig> binding modes were observed, albeit with higher frequency  for binding modes where the larger part of the substrate was bound at the aglycone binding subsites .fig.  <dig> initial products from inm and lbg. manno-oligosaccharide products formed after 30 s of a inm and b lbg hydrolysis by blman5_ <dig> as measured using hpaec-pad analysis. the chromatograms from blman5_8-Δcbm <dig> , blman5_ <dig>  and the substrate before hydrolysis

binding to polysaccharides and oligosaccharides
based on retardation in affinity electrophoresis, blman5_ <dig> bound to lbg-lv  with an apparent kd of  <dig>  g · l− <dig>  while the affinity of blman5_8-Δcbm <dig> was too low to be determined due to lack of change in relative retardation as a function of increasing the lbg concentration. neither the full-length nor the truncated enzyme displayed binding to soluble hydroxyethyl cellulose , insoluble cellulose  or insoluble mannan  in this analysis.

spr is a particularly powerful tool to quantify low affinity interactions as observed above for blman5_ <dig> binding to mannan. ideally, cbm binding analysis would be carried out on an isolated cbm. in our case, however, the small size of the cbm <dig> and the presence of only a single lysine residue , renders the immobilization of the protein to sufficient levels challenging. to circumvent this limitation and avoid using this single lysine residue for immobilization with risk of affecting the function of the module, the binding analysis was done using immobilized full-length enzyme and blman5_8-Δcbm <dig> to evaluate the contribution of the cbm <dig> to binding. only the full-length enzyme showed affinity towards m <dig> based on the spr analysis, which suggested that the cbm <dig> mediated binding to m <dig> . the apparent binding stoichiometry of both m <dig> and m <dig> was approximately twice for the full-length enzyme as compared to the isolated catalytic module , reflecting binding of these ligands to both the gh <dig> catalytic module and the cbm <dig>  no binding to cellotetraose was measured with either enzyme variant.table  <dig> surface plasmon resonance binding analysis of blman5_ <dig> to oligosaccharides

sequence analyses and homology modeling
blman5_ <dig> contains the seven amino acids that are conserved in family gh <dig>  <cit>  . the homology model of blman5_ <dig> revealed that residues interacting with the substrate in subsites – <dig> through – <dig> are conserved between blman5_ <dig> and tfman5a  <cit>  . there are also several aromatic residues in the putative aglycone binding region of blman5_ <dig> including trp <dig> and trp <dig> which are invariant in gh5_ <dig> as well as trp <dig> which is conserved in 77 % of gh5_ <dig> sequences .fig.  <dig> modeling of putative subsite residues in blman5_ <dig>  conserved aromatic residues in the active site of blman5_ <dig> are visualized  by homology modeling using the structure from tfman5a  as template . a semi-transparent molecular surface is shown to depict the topology of the active site of tfman5a. the conserved aromatic residues are designated with blman5_ <dig> numbering and the co-crystallized m <dig>  accommodated at subsites – <dig> through – <dig> in tfman5a, is shown in white

discussion
the human gastrointestinal tract comprises one of the most densely populated ecological niches in nature, with bacterial counts exceeding  <dig> cells · g− <dig> content  <cit> . since most dietary glycans are indigestible to humans, their metabolism plays an instrumental role in shaping the composition of the gut microbiota  <cit> . to date, the gh <dig> mannanases from bacteroides fragilis  <cit>  and bifidobacterium adolescentis  <cit>  are the only described β-mannanases from the gut niche. in this study we report the biochemical properties of the first gh <dig> mannanase from the bifidobacterium genus.

blman5_ <dig> is an exceptionally potent enzyme optimized for efficient depolymerization of soluble mannan
the preferred substrates for blman5_ <dig> are soluble glucomannan and galactomannnan with low degree of galactosyl substitution . blman5_ <dig> displays 19-fold higher kcat on lbg as compared to m <dig> , suggesting that substrate contacts beyond five mannosyl residues contribute to catalytic turnover, similarly to other mannanases  <cit> . the catalytic efficiency of blman5_ <dig> on lbg is the highest measured to date for a gh <dig> mannanase owing to both a very high kcat and a low km . notably, the km value for blman5_ <dig> towards soluble mannan is one of the lowest amongst bacterial mannanases, which is likely to be an important advantage in the adaptation to the highly competitive gut ecological niche. the km value in part reflects substrate affinity, which appears higher at the aglycone-accommodating region of the active site cleft as evident from the productive binding frequency of m <dig> . substrate affinity at aglycone subsites has been shown to contribute to lowering km and increasing transglycosylation  <cit> . this is in line with the high transglycosylation activity of blman5_ <dig>  reflected by the disproportionate liberation of m <dig> relative to m <dig> ratio using m <dig> as a substrate , which is attributed to secondary hydrolysis of transglycosylation products of larger degree of polymerization . interestingly, sequence comparison and homology modeling revealed that the putative aglycone binding regions of thermobifida fusca gh5_ <dig> mannanase   <cit>  and blman5_ <dig> are lined with conserved aromatic residues, including trp <dig> and trp <dig> . indeed, the position and conservation of these residues correlate with the favored productive binding at the aglycone region .

the cbm <dig> of blman5_ <dig> binds soluble mannan with low affinity and represents a new clade within cbm10
the cbm <dig> of the modular cjxyn10a xylanase from cellvibrio japonicus, which binds tightly to avicel, is the only structurally characterized cbm <dig> member  <cit> . the man5a β-mannanase from the same organism, which possesses a c-terminal tandem repeat of two cbm <dig> modules , was also shown to bind both avicel and insoluble mannan   <cit> . deletion of cbm10- <dig> of cjman5a, which is a close homolog to the counterpart from cjxyn10a, resulted in a severe reduction of affinity to avicel and inm  <cit> , which hinted that the cbm10- <dig> was not efficiently mediating binding to the above insoluble substrates. similarly, the cbm <dig> of blman5_ <dig>  which belongs to the same subgroup as the cbm10- <dig> of cjman5a, did not bind to avicel or hec. by contrast, this cbm <dig> conferred increased affinity to soluble mannan based on larger relative retardation in affinity electrophoresis of the full-length blman5_ <dig> compared to the truncated blman5_8-Δcbm <dig>  remarkably, the affinity of blman5_ <dig> for soluble galactomannan is 35 − 67-fold lower than that reported for gh <dig> mannanases baman26a from bifidobacterium adolescentis   <cit>  and cfman26a from cellulomonas fimi  <cit>  possessing typical mannan-specific cbm <dig> modules. binding analysis using spr confirmed the mannan specificity and low affinity of the cbm <dig> of blman5_ <dig>  as deletion of this module considerably reduced the apparent stoichiometry of binding to m <dig> and m <dig> . blman5_8-Δcbm <dig> moreover displayed about two-fold higher affinity to m <dig> and m <dig> than the full-length enzyme, suggesting that the cbm <dig> had lower affinity than the catalytic module. the cbm <dig> of blman5_ <dig> is a novel low-affinity cbm that binds manno-oligosaccharides with kd values in the mm range, in contrast to canonical moderate-affinity mannan-binding cbms displaying kd values in the low μm range  <cit> . low-affinity starch-binding cbms, conferring more dynamic binding, have been identified in plastidial α-amylases and starch-regulatory glucan water dikinases  <cit> .

the low affinity of the cbm <dig> is consistent with its very modest impact on the kinetic parameters of lbg hydrolysis . the trend of increased km and kcat upon cbm deletion is similar to other enzymes acting on soluble substrates, but the magnitude of these changes is much larger with typical cbms than for the cbm <dig> of blman5_ <dig>  <cit> .

the cbm <dig> of blman5_ <dig> clusters exclusively with counterparts from gh <dig> and gh <dig> mannanases and segregates in the phylogenetic tree from sequences resembling the cellulose-specific cbm <dig> from cjxyn10a  also occurring in xylanases, cellulases and other carbohydrate-active enzymes as well as mannanases . the aromatic binding residue tyr <dig> in the cellulose-binding site of cbm <dig> of cjxyn10a  <cit>  is substituted to smaller residues  in the blman5_ <dig> cbm <dig> subfamily, that possesses a unique insertion preceding the substrate binding residue trp <dig> and lacks the two conserved cysteines cys <dig> and cys <dig>  suggesting the loss of one disulphide bridge compared to the clade represented by the cbm <dig> of cjxyn10a  <cit>  . altogether, the loss of the tyr <dig> aromatic stacking platform combined with significant differences in the loop length close to the binding trp <dig> provide a possible explanation for the low affinity of the cbm <dig> from blman5_ <dig> compared to cjxyn10a. additionally, the loss of a disulfide bridge may elicit flexibility and/or structural changes that affect the biochemical properties of the blman5_ <dig> cbm <dig> and its close homologs. assigning the effects of these differences requires further structural and mutational analyses of this clade of cbm <dig>

the concentration and residence time of mannan in the gastrointestinal tract is expected to be highly dynamic and dependent on nutritional intake and gut microbiota composition. the presence of mannan utilization pathways in human gut-adapted taxa, including the major gut commensal genus bacteroides, reflects an evolutionary adaptation to the dietary intake of this glycan. recently, a novel pathway for the utilization of mannan involving a putative extracellular mannobiose-forming gh <dig> exo-mannanase from bacteroides fragilis  was reported  <cit> . the mannobiose released by this enzyme is taken up by specialized ion symporters and subsequently degraded and metabolized intracellularly by an epimerase and a phosphorylase. this gh <dig> enzyme does not possess a cbm, and was speculated to act on mannan fragments produced by other β-mannanases from the same organism. the extracellular putatively cell-attached gh <dig> mannanase from bifidobacterium adolescentis  hydrolyzes mannan to mainly mannotriose  <cit> . this modular enzyme, featuring a gh <dig> catalytic module joined to a c-terminal tandem repeat of cbm <dig> mannan-binding modules, binds tightly to lbg   <cit> . the deletion of the tandem cbm <dig> repeat abolishes measurable binding and yields an enzyme with very high km , reminiscent of typical canonical moderate-affinity cbms that decrease apparent km values of the enzymes they are attached to  <cit> . this cbm-mediated decrease in km, however, is often associated with a penalty of reduced kcat  <cit> . such effects are very different in case of blman5_ <dig>  where the cbm <dig> makes little contribution to the low km. the justification for maintaining a cbm, albeit with lower affinity, could be a trade-off to increase the substrate-binding affinity of the enzyme  and thus lower the koff of the polymeric substrate, while minimizing the energy barrier pertaining to anchoring of the substrate tightly to the cbm. this may maintain proximity of the substrate to the enzyme, which has been shown to promote additional hydrolysis events following the initial enzyme-substrate encounter in cellulases  <cit>  due to a higher kcat/koff ratio. the optimization of substrate affinity through a low-affinity cbm is likely to offer a different adaptation solution to the fierce competition prevalent in the gut niche as opposed to the higher substrate affinity, but decrease in catalytic rates associated with canonical cbms.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, blman5_ <dig>  which is conserved in the b. animalis subsp. lactis displays a different modular organization, product profile and substrate preference than characterized β-mannanases from gut bacteria. blman5_ <dig> is the first characterized gh <dig> β-mannanase from the gut niche, which moreover possesses a novel low-affinity soluble-mannan-specific cbm <dig> not previously described in β-mannanases. this cbm may have evolved to increase the available substrate binding surface, while imparting less reduction in the catalytic rate typically observed for canonical moderate affinity cbms. these unique substrate-binding properties highlight the diversity of mannan utilization strategies. further studies are required to assess how these differences and the interplay of extracellular enzymes and transport systems contribute to establishing the hierarchy of mannan degradation in the gut niche.
