BACKGROUND
rice  is one of the most important food crops in the world, providing calories for over 21% of global population and 76% of south east asian  <cit> . the yield of rice is determined primarily by two vital factors, the grain filling rate and subsequently the grain weight  <cit> . it has been demonstrated by many researches that grain weight and the grain plumpness  are mostly positional-dependent in a rice panicle  <cit> – <cit> . a rice panicle is composed of numerous branches termed spikelets with some having high quality seeds termed superior spikelets and some with poor quality seeds termed inferior spikelets. in general, the superior spikelets flower earlier and subsequently have a faster grain-filling rate in seed development, producing high-quality seeds. the flowers or seeds on superior spikelets are typically located on apical primary branches in a panicle. in contrast, the inferior spikelets flower later with a lower grain-filling rate and are located on the proximal secondary branches, resulting in low-quality seeds  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> .

micrornas , a type of endogenous non-coding small rnas produced from stem-loop structured precursors, have been proved to play curial roles in many aspects of plant development, such as organ morphogenesis  <cit> , <cit> , stress response  <cit> , <cit> , flowering control  <cit> , <cit> , phytohormone homeostasis  <cit> , <cit> , and grain/fruit development  <cit> , <cit> . the expressions of various mirnas are extremely dynamic during rice grain development, revealed by a series of studies utilizing small rna high-throughput sequencing technology  <cit> , <cit> – <cit> . for example, in one study, most mirnas were shown to be equally expressed or expressed much higher in grains of 6– <dig> days than those of 1– <dig> days after fertilization  <cit> . a similar study showed that a high proportion of the detected mirnas were up-regulated in seeds of  <dig> to  <dig> days after fertilization  <cit> . the analysis of  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas in our previous studies suggests the expressions of these mirnas in rice grain were in a developmental stage dependent manner. the expressions of most known mirnas increased gradually as rice grain filling went on  <cit> . these observations were also in contrast to another study showing that about half of the known mirnas were up-regulated, while the remaining mirnas were down-regulated during indica rice grain development  <cit> .

although it is not known yet if all the known mirnas are involved in grain development, certain specific mirnas showed a high correlation with the grain developmental process. mir <dig> is such a candidate mirna that may plays a role in rice grain filling through the auxin-mir167-arf8-osgh <dig>  regulatory pathway  <cit> . over-expressing mir <dig> significantly reduced plant height, tiller number of individual plant, panicle length, spikelet number of each panicle, and seed setting rate via regulating its target arf family transcriptional factors  <cit> . mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> are potential grain filling regulators via controlling the levels of their target genes which encode copper-binding proteins and/or l-ascorbate oxidases  <cit> . mir <dig> is highly expressed in rice young panicles and grains, and over-expressed mir <dig> enlarged the grain size, promoted panicle branching, and significantly increased rice grain yield via down-regulating its target oslac <cit> . osspl <dig>  a target of mir <dig>  contributes to generating ideal rice plant architecture with a reduced tiller number, increased lodging resistance and enhanced grain yield  <cit> , <cit> . osspl <dig>  another target of mir <dig>  plays crucial roles in regulating grain size, shape and quality as well  <cit> . furthermore, the seed size was reduced in mir393-overexpressed transgenic lines when compared with that of the wild-type  <cit> . all these results indicate that mirnas play important roles in rice grain development or rice grain filling.

we have previously found  <dig> and  <dig> known mirnas expressed in superior and inferior grains respectively and specifically at  <dig> days after flowering . among them,  <dig> mirnas were found differentially expressed between grains from superior and inferior spikelets, suggesting their potential roles in multiple physiological or metabolic processes during rice grain development  <cit> . to further investigate their dynamic roles of mirnas in determining the development of superior and inferior spikelets during all stages of the entire rice grain filling process, we sequenced and analyzed mirnas in superior and inferior spikelets of five stages at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  35daf, respectively. as a result,  <dig> known mirnas,  <dig> novel mirnas were revealed. those known mirnas that differentially expressed between superior and inferior spikelets were specifically studied and analyzed in clustering. we found that the target genes of some key mirnas constituted essential regulatory networks in controlling various metabolic processes, including hormone homeostasis and starch accumulations. most importantly, we found that the occurrence of inferior spikelets was tightly associated with the lower expressions of mirnas that were differentially expressed between superior and inferior spikelets. our results suggest a vital role of mirna networks and their expression levels in determining the rice grain filling and provide mechanisms for the formation of grain weight in superior and inferior spikelets.

RESULTS
physiological and phenotypic differences between superior and inferior spikelets
in general, the rice grain filling processes were dynamic in spikelets according to their locations on the rachis/panicle branches. superior spikelets are on the top of the panicle, always flower earlier, have grains filling faster, and the higher final grain weight and plumpness than the inferior spikelets which are located on the base of the panicle  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . specifically, grain filling rates of superior spikelets  at the initial  <dig> to  <dig> daf are  <dig> times faster than those of the inferior spikelets . within  <dig> daf, the majority of the grains in superior spikelets were filled up at the highest rate and then the filling rate dropped to a level that is comparable to the highest filling rate of the inferior grains . in comparison, the grain filling rate in inferior spikelets  was only less than 50% of the highest filling rate of the superior spikelets  at this time point. the overall process of grain filling of superior spikelets took about  <dig> days with a much higher filling rate showing an asymmetrical curve, whereas that of the inferior spikelets took  <dig> days with a significantly lower filling rate showing a symmetrical normal curve . consequently, grains from superior spikelets were phenotypically larger and fully plump, while those from inferior spikelets appeared smaller with partial filling .

differential expressions of overall small rnas between superior and inferior spikelets
there are two major populations of small rnas that have been identified in plants according to their lengths: 21-nucleotide  and 24-nt small rnas. in order to understand how these two types of small rnas are expressed in superior and inferior spikelets during rice grain filling, high throughput rna sequencing technology was employed to the small rna libraries made from both types of spikelets. ten samples of superior and inferior grains at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> daf were used to isolate small rnas for sequencing. after trimming adaptor sequences and removing those reads with low quality and lengths smaller than  <dig> nucleotides, about  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> high-quality small rna reads, representing the lowest  <dig> , <dig> to the highest  <dig> , <dig> distinct small rnas, were obtained from each library. among those, more than  <dig> , <dig> distinct reads  were perfectly matched to the rice genome by analysis using soap   <cit> .

among millions of high-quality small rnas from the individual libraries, the 24-nt and 21-nt small rnas were dominant in all cases . specifically,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total reads were 24-nt and 21-nt small rnas in the developing seeds from the ten libraries. in contrast to the report that 21-nt small rnas were the most abundant population present in leaf and tricellular pollen in rice  <cit> , our data showed that 24-nt small rnas occupied the highest percentage in both superior and inferior spikelets , which may be due to tissue- and temporal- specific expressions of small rnas during rice organ development. furthermore, there are more 24-nt small rnas present in inferior spikelets than in the superior ones at all grain-filling stages, whereas the 21-nt small rnas showed a reversed trend .

among the above-mentioned small rnas, mirnas as well as other types of small rnas were analyzed. for example, all the known mirnas were identified by comparing the total small rnas with the known mirnas stored in mirbase , and their abundances were analyzed. we observed that a higher percentage of total known mirna was expressed in superior spikelets than in inferior spikelets during most rice grain filling stages except for the one at  <dig> daf, at which no obvious difference was found between superior and inferior spikelets . other types of small rnas that were characterized for each dataset were mainly associated with rrnas, snrnas, snornas, and trnas. these small rna populations contained more diverse small rnas with higher reads in superior spikelets than in inferior spikelets at all the grain-filling stages .

most mirnas expressed higher in superior than in inferior spikelets and a few mirnas showed the opposite
to understand how mirnas were expressed in superior and inferior spikelets during the grain filling process, the abundance of each mirna from the same libraries was normalized to transcripts per million  as performed in our previous publication  <cit> . the clean reads of small rnas were mapped to mirna precursors in mirbase release  <dig>  and altogether  <dig> known mirnas were identified in the ten libraries . to extract meaningful data for further analysis, only mirnas whose expressions were higher than  <dig> tpm at least in one of the datasets were selected. following this criterion, a total of  <dig> known mirnas were chosen for their expressional analyses . we found that  <dig> mirnas were differentially expressed between superior and inferior spikelets at least in one of the same filling stages, and most of them were more abundant in superior than inferior spikelets at early and middle grain filling stages .

in addition, the largest difference between superior and inferior spikelets was found at  <dig> daf, and among the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas,  <dig>  mirnas expressed higher in superior spikelets . furthermore, among the  <dig> higher expressed mirnas,  <dig> mirnas , such as mir168a, mir1861b,d,f,h-j,l, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir1883a,b, mir <dig>  miir815b-d, and mir827a,b, were expressed noticeably higher in superior than inferior spikelets at all stages in rice grain filling . in contrast, only  <dig> out of the  <dig> mirnas , mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir162a,b, mir164a,b,f, mir166k,l, mir2094-3p, and mir2101-3p, were more abundantly expressed in inferior spikelets at the similar grain-filling stage during rice grain filling .

targets of the differentially expressed known mirnas related to rice grain filling
plant mirnas recognize and bind imperfectly to their target mrnas through base-pairing, leading to mostly mrna cleavage or, to some extent, translational repression at the post-transcriptional levels  <cit> . genome-wide mirna-directed target mrna cleavage can be identified by a high-throughput sequencing method known as degradome analysis or parallel analysis of rna ends. this method was successfully used in rice to identify rice mirna’s targets  <cit> – <cit> . recently, the identified targets of rice mirnas using such a technology have been summarized and reanalyzed through seqtar based on a new algorithm  <cit> , providing a useful platform for us to analyze potential mirna targets during rice grain filling process. to analyze the function of these differentially expressed mirnas in grain filling, their targets identified by seqtar were collected and used for go enrichment analysis. as a result,  <dig> target mrnas were found and submitted to agrigo at the published website for further analysis  <cit>  . after the go biological process enrichment analysis in contrast to their expression backgrounds/references, these mirna target genes were functionally categorized into the following specific biological processes with or without significant differences from their respective backgrounds/references :

1) mirna target genes were largely from “cellular process” , “metabolic process” , and “response to stimulus”  with small differences from their backgrounds/references;  small portions of mirna target genes were functioning in “localization”  or the “establishment of localization”  with no differences from their backgrounds/references; and finally but not least  a fairly large amount of important mirna target genes were functioning in “reproduction” , “biological regulation” , “regulation of biological process” , “developmental process” , “reproductive process” , and the so-called “multicellular organismal process”, “multi-organism process”  with significant differences from their backgrounds/references. among these important mirna target genes that had significant expressional differences from their backgrounds/references, genes functioning in “reproduction”, “biological regulation”, “regulation of biological process”, “developmental process”, and “reproductive process” are extremely important in relation to the rice grain development and grain filling process. relations of some representative key regulatory genes and their corresponding mirna regulators during the grain filling processes of both superior and inferior spikelets were further analyzed below.

in general, the expressions of mirnas and their targets show negative correlations if simple regulations exist between them  <cit> , <cit> . to identify the expression patterns of key mirnas and their targets that are related to rice grain filling, we selected targets of three highly expressed mirnas , which may have crucial roles in rice grain filling, for further study by qrt-pcr. specially, mir <dig> and mir <dig> are auxin-related mirnas  that determine the cellular levels of free auxin through down-regulating their target nac and arf family transcript factors  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . these auxin-mirs may play a role in controlling rice grain filling. mir <dig> via targeting a transcript encoding a laccase-like protein, positively regulates rice grain size and panicle branching  <cit> . indeed, the relative expressions of these mirna target genes had a strong but simple negative correlation with the levels of their corresponding mirnas in both the superior and inferior spikelets during the rice grain filling processes .

novel grain-filling related mirnas and their predicted targets identified in superior and inferior spikelets
to identify novel mirnas in superior and inferior spikelets during rice grain filling, mirna candidates were first collected from mireap and then determined to be novel mirnas if they have not been reported and their corresponding mirna*s were also identified in one of our library  <cit>  or the potential mirnas were detected in more than half of the ten libraries  <cit> . among all the candidate novel mirnas, two  were highly expressed  in at least one of our dataset and were thus included as novel mirnas. following these criteria, altogether,  <dig> novel mirnas were identified to have perfect stem-loop secondary structures but have never been reported . among these novel mirnas, most showed differential expressions in a panicle-location and/or developmental-dependent manner. for instance, mirn <dig> was identified to be highly expressed only during the early and middle grain filling stages in inferior spikelets , but not expressed in superior spikelets or in inferior spikelets at later grain filling stages . furthermore, the expressions of three newly identified mirnas were validated by stem-loop qrt-pcr, and the results were consistent with the data we collected from high throughput sequencing . finally, we predicted the target genes for these  <dig> new mirnas based on psrnatarget proposed by dai et al.  <cit> . altogether,  <dig> candidate target genes were predicted for the  <dig> novel mirnas except mirn <dig> . two target genes of mirn <dig> were selected for validation by rna ligase–mediated 5’-race because these two targets can be identified in the degradome database psrobot  <cit> . the mirna binding sites of these two targets were located on the 3’ or 5’ untranslated regions , but the cleavage sites were somehow immediately downstream or upstream of the mirna binding sites . two other target genes of mirn <dig> were also observed in the degradome database termed starbase   <cit> , suggesting that this newly identified mirna may target their predicted genes for regulations. nevertheless, these non-canonical cleavage sites have never been reported previously, suggesting either an unidentified mechanism by which the target mrna was processed or that these putative targets were just random degradated and they were not the mirna bona fide targets.

discussion
despite as many as  <dig> mirnas and one mirna* and their expressions at certain specific developmental stages have been documented for oryza sativa in the mirbase release  <dig> , knowledge of mirnas dynamics in grain filling and grain development specifically in superior and inferior spikelets is lacking. in this study, high-throughput sequencing technology was employed to gather rich sequence reads information which makes investigation of the mirna dynamics possible in grain filling during the development of superior and inferior spikelets.

in plants, the majority of small rnas are 21-24nt in length. among them, most mirnas are 20-22nt, while most sirnas are either 21-nt or 24-nt in length  <cit> . in addition, 23-nt small rnas were also reported and might represent a new kind of functional small rna  <cit> . using high-throughput sequencing technology, over  <dig> million clean reads were obtained from superior and inferior spikelets at five different developmental stages during rice grain filling process. unlike the rice leaf and tricellular pollen tissues where the 21-nt small rnas were the major reported small rna population  <cit> , filling or developing grains contained the most abundant 24-nt small rnas by sequencing of ten small rna libraries constructed from different stages of growing grains. furthermore, the expressions of these 24-nt sirnas were extremely dynamic in a developmental stage-dependent manner in rice grain filling, indicating that 24-nt sirnas may also play a key role in the formation of distinct grain filling patterns between superior and inferior spikelets, because these 24-nt sirnas are related to certain important rice kegg pathways, such as the starch and sucrose biosynthesis, as discussed in our previous publication  <cit> .

differential expression patterns of mirnas may determine the differential grain filling patterns of superior and inferior spikelets or vice versa
 <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified in at least one of the ten small rna libraries from different developmental filling grains in rice. expressions of mirnas in a developmental stage-dependent and/or tissue-specific manner are the hallmarks of small rnas found in plant development  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . grain filling process has no exceptions. by massively parallel sequencing, we detected almost all of the mirnas that were expressed higher than  <dig> tpm had their unique expressional changes throughout different developmental stages of the rice grain filling process. the majority of these mirnas increased gradually as the grain filling progressed in both superior  <cit>  and inferior spikelets . these findings expanded the previous understanding on expressions of many mirnas focused on from relatively earlier stages of grain development such that 1– <dig> daf grains had more expressions at the second half period of such short timeframe than the first half time window  <cit> , <cit>  or other fragmented study of mirna dynamics in indica rice grain development  <cit> , to a more systematic study of mirnas over the entire rice grain developmental process.

specifically, our study showed that the majority of mirnas in superior spikelets expressed higher at the initial and middle stage , and peaked at 15daf, whereas in the inferior spikelets, most mirnas had higher expression levels at the later stage  . since the overall expressions of mirna target genes were in generally negative correlation with overall expression levels of mirnas during grain filling process, this observation explained why the previously reported  <dig> out of  <dig> genes were expressed over two folds lower in superior spikelets than in inferior spikelets at  <dig> days post-anthesis in rice  <cit> . thus, simple negative regulations by mirnas were dominant in rice grain filling by our observation. so far, we could not conclude that the differential expression patterns between superior and inferior spikelets determine the difference of grain qualities between the two types of grains in rice. it could be just the opposite that their developmental differences determine the differential expressions of mirnas in rice.

importance of individual mirnas in grain filling activities of superior and inferior spikelets
in animals, individual mirnas have multiple targets and a single protein-coding gene is normally regulated by multiple mirnas. in contrast, plant mirnas have narrow but important target gene spectrums. thus the importance of individual mirnas is often visible when their expressions are altered. in the case of mir <dig>  for example, osspls are its targets that are under strict control by mir <dig> in the young panicles due to a predominant expression of mir <dig> in panicles. over-expression of mir <dig> in rice resulted in severe dwarfism, significant reduction of panicle size, and flowering delay  <cit> . more specifically, osspl <dig>  targeted by mir <dig>  controls shoot branching development at the vegetative growth stage, which forms the basis for generating ideal rice plant with increased lodging resistance and enhanced grain yield  <cit> , <cit> . osspl <dig>  another mir <dig> target, encodes a protein that positively regulates cell proliferation. over expressing osspl <dig> promoted cell division and grain filling and hence increased grain width and rice yield  <cit> . in our study, mir <dig> not only highly expressed in superior and inferior spikelets during rice grain filling, but also showed a dynamic expressional change along grain filling progresses. specifically, mir <dig> is expressed higher at early grain filling stage , but lower at middle and later grain filling stage in superior than inferior spikelets . the differential expression patterns of mir <dig> have a strong correlation with the difference of grain filling rate  between superior and inferior spikelets, suggesting a potential contribution of mir <dig> to the grain filling difference between superior and inferior spikelets.

as an individual mirna, mir <dig> was highly expressed in both superior and inferior spikelets during the early and middle grain filling stage, and decreased continuously along the whole grain filling period. overall, mir <dig> was much lower expressed in inferior than superior spikelets, especially during the early and middle grain filling processes . it has been reported that mir <dig> positively controls the rice grain size through down-regulating its target, oslac, a laccase-like protein that may control plant sensitivity to brassinosteroid  <cit> . brassinosteroid hormone levels can be regulated by c- <dig> hydroxylases in rice. over-expressing c- <dig> hydroxylases in rice will enhance the tiller and seed numbers and grain weight, especially the weight of the seeds at the bases of the spikelets, increased in c- <dig> hydroxylases over-expressed transgenic rice  <cit> . we found that lower grain weight of inferior spikelets might result from the lower expression of mir <dig> during the grain filling of inferior spikelets .

mir <dig>  another individual mirna, induced by aba, has a role in controlling transcript levels of two myb factors during arabidopsis seed germination  <cit> . although both superior and inferior spikelets contained a good amount of mir <dig>  this mirna was expressed higher in inferior spikelets than in superior spikelets in our study . previous researches demonstrated that cell-division, grain-filling rates, as well as starch accumulation in rice grains were significantly and positively correlated with aba contents  <cit> , <cit> . application of aba at early grain-filling stage can significantly enhance endosperm cell division rate, so as to increase cell number, and promote grain-filling rate and the final grain weight of inferior spikelets  <cit> , <cit> . indeed, it has been reported that mir159ab double mutant has pleiotropic morphological defects, including altered growth habit, curled leaves, and most importantly, small siliques and small seeds in arabidopsis  <cit> .

rice seed development is actually a process for starch deposition, due to starch accounts for 80 ~ 90% of the final weight of brown rice. as one of the key enzymes involved in the starch synthesis pathways, activity of starch synthase was shown to be significantly and positively correlated with rice grain filling rate  <cit> . interestingly, such a key enzyme has been found to be regulated by mir <dig> as revealed by the 5’-race and degradome analysis  <cit> . our data showed that mir <dig> was highly but differentially expressed in superior and inferior spikelets . additionally, mir <dig> has been demonstrated to target genes that encode beta-amylase and starch-binding domain containing proteins and thus may also play curial roles during rice seed development  <cit> , <cit> . interestingly, mir <dig> expressed much lower in inferior spikelets than in superior ones during all the grain filling stages .

roles of mirnas in auxin homeostasis
auxin homeostasis and signal transduction related mirnas, including mir <dig>  <cit> , mir <dig>  <cit> , mir <dig>  <cit> , <cit> , mir <dig>  <cit> , <cit> , and mir <dig>  <cit> , <cit> , have been reported in arabidopsis. these mirnas belong to highly conserved mirnas between rice and arabidopsis and among different plant species. while mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> expressed at comparatively low levels during rice grain filling in our study, mir <dig> and mir <dig> were very abundant in both superior and inferior spikelets . by comparing their expressions between superior and inferior spikelets, we found mir <dig> and mir <dig> were higher expressed in superior spikelets at all grain filling stages except  <dig> daf. specifically, mir164e expressed  <dig>  and  <dig>  times higher in superior than in inferior spikelets at  <dig> and  <dig> daf, respectively . similarly, mir167d,f-h,j were expressed  <dig>  times more in superior spikelets than the inferior spikelets at 15daf . furthermore, the expressions of both mir <dig> and mir <dig> in superior spikelets were gradually increased during rice grain filling. in contrast, in inferior spikelets although the expression of mir <dig> was also increased along with grain filling process, mir <dig> first slightly decreased at the initial grain filling stage and then was up-regulated. these tiny differential expressions in mirnas between superior and inferior spikelets may impose a big impact on the differential grain filling behaviors between the two types of spikelets since the tiny changes of these mirnas-controlled auxin homeostasis were enough to change the grain filling activities. indeed, mir167-arf8-osgh <dig>  regulatory node was observed to play a key role in tuning cellular free auxin contents in rice callus development  <cit> . similar regulations of auxin content may exist in grain filling process.

auxin content may indeed play a key role in grain filling. it has been reported that the expression of putative iaa biosynthesis genes, osyuc <dig>  osyuc <dig>  and ostar <dig> were strongly correlated with iaa content in developing rice seeds, and may influence rice grain filling by regulating starch deposition  <cit> . therefore, expression patterns of these genes in spikelets during rice grain filling were tested by qrt-pcr method in our study, and the results indicated that these genes were gradually decreased in superior spikelets. in inferior spikelets, however, they were first up-regulated until  <dig> daf, and then reduced in the middle of grain filling process. while osyuc <dig> and osyuc <dig> remained almost unchanged since  <dig> daf, ostar <dig> kept decreasing until 27daf and then increased dramatically until the end of grain filling . overall, our data showed that the expressions of these three genes were negatively correlated with the levels of mir <dig>  while positively correlated with iaa content in superior and inferior spikelets during rice grain filling processes  <cit> . iaa content in developing rice seeds was positively and significantly correlated with the rates of endosperm cell division and grain filling. therefore, differential accumulation of iaa, or differential expression of auxin-related mirnas, such as mir <dig> and mir <dig>  in grains may be a reason for poor grain filling and less final grain weight of inferior spikelets  <cit>  .

mechanisms for synchronous grain filling activities in superior and inferior spikelets
while many studies over-stated roles of individual mirnas in development, study of hundreds of mirnas in relation to thousands of their target genes in dynamics would place us in a good stead in fully understanding of the mechanisms underlying the synchronous grain filling activities in grain development. for example, mir <dig> was revealed to play a key role in the establishment of rice architecture and grain size  <cit> – <cit> , <cit> . mir <dig> is a key determiner of rice agronomic and yield characters  <cit> , <cit> . mir <dig> is an important player in regulating inclination of flag leaves and stress response  <cit> , <cit> . most recently, mir <dig> was determined to be a key factor of modulating rice panicle branching and grain size  <cit> . all these mirnas function individually by targeting and modulating the expressions of key transcription factors that determine agronomical important traits during rice development. our study indicates that these mirnas may function as cohorts coordinately in rice grain filling. it would be interesting to see that a change in one such mirna or its target could alter the changes of not only specific traits but also the changes of other mirnas and their targets in dynamic regulations.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results together with data published by other laboratories suggest that differentially expressed mirnas, especially those that expressed differently at early grain filling stage and that are involved in the hormone homeostasis and starch deposition, etc., might or at least partially account for, the asynchronous and asymmetric filling patterns during rice grain filling and the formation of different final grain weights between superior and inferior spikelets. future studies will focus on roles of multiple mirnas, such as auxin related mirnas, in the discovery process of mechanisms for poor seed filling in rice.
