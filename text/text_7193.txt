BACKGROUND
there exist several public data sources such as biocarta  <cit> , kegg  <cit> , wikipathways  <cit> , pathway commons  <cit> , ncbi's biosystems  <cit> , nci nature  <cit> , reactome  <cit>  and humancyc  <cit>  for pathway annotations including cellular process, metabolic process, molecular function, and physiological process. these data sources also provide a variety of information ranging from simple formats, for example a list of genes involved in a specific pathway, to complex information, like the directed graph of biological entities and their effect on each other. there also exist private data sources like ingenuity  <cit> , pathway studios  <cit> , and protein lounge  however they are not freely available.

pathway information can offer insights for a variety of research including genome-wide gene expression analysis. gene expression levels detected by microarrays and next generation sequencing  allow the profiling of gene products that are differentiated between diverse conditions. likewise, genomic copy number alteration, differential methylation, and other genome-wide profiling experiments result in a list of resultant genes with the capacity to differentiate phenotypic or treatment conditions. often biological concepts are used to describe gene lists  <cit> . the concepts are unifying characteristics that are statistically enriched for the gene list and provide functional insight related to the gene list. any concept that has a predefined list of genes matching some or all of the experiment's resultant genes is considered enriched and the level of enrichment is statistically quantifiable . selection of pathways  based on the statistical significant enrichment score  is one natural way to infer function from gene expression patterns. gene set enrichment analysis   <cit>  introduced a kolmogorov-smirnov like method that finds enriched pathways by statistical analysis of genes that can be ordered by measurement such as expression fold change. however when no ordering measurement is available, some other means, like fisher's exact test is necessary to find enriched pathways.

the development of many genome-wide profiling technologies and the number of pathway data sources has lead to an explosion in the number of pathways to be studied from a single gene set. chowbina et al.  <cit>  discuss the integration of multiple data sources to determine a single collection of pathways that provides functional insight for experimental gene sets. additionally, they provide an online database  to give users access to their integrated pathway database containing  <dig> human pathways. yu et al.  <cit>  have combined several pathway database to create another integrated pathway database  with  <dig> human pathways. to create a similar database, we downloaded pathways from biocarta, pathway commons, ncbi biosystems, and wikipathways, and after removing pathways with no gene members,  <dig>  pathways remain  from specific sources including wikipathways, reactome, kegg, nci nature, biocarta and humancyc. our database contains all of the pathway sources of hpd and hipathdb except protein lounge which is not publically available. while larger collection of pathways may appear to be better starting point, the interdependency and/or redundancy within and between databases will skew the statistical assessment of a large gene set and lead to incorrect functional associations. a better solution would be to consolidate the complete list of pathways as non-redundant and representative pathways, enabling better understanding of any experiment including gene set enrichment results.

a natural way to combine lists is by parsing the pathway names, for example, kegg, reactome and wikipathways all contain "apoptosis". however in this instance although the pathway names are the same, the gene sets are different. name matching by itself also misses exact gene set matches. "synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies" from wikipathways and "ketone body metabolism" from pathway commons contain exactly the same  <dig> genes. this match would be missed if simple name matching were employed.

another natural method of pathway consolidation finds some overlap between the gene members of pathways pairs, including exact gene set matches. by observing the same gene set in two pathways they could be consolidated into a single representative pathway. for example, three separate reactome pathways contain the exact same gene members, "smac binds to iaps", "smac-mediated apoptotic response", and "smac-mediated dissociation of iap:caspase complexes". like the previous example, all three pathways could be consolidated into one "pathway concept" simply by observing the identical gene membership in sets. among the  <dig>  pathways,  <dig> have exactly the same gene members with at least one other pathway, forming  <dig> distinct groups. this method would reduce the number of pathways somewhat . to consolidate further, pathways that are similar could be combined when they have sufficiently similar gene sets, however the difficulty is determination of "sufficiently similar".

a naïve way of determining "sufficient similarity" is by using subset relationship. for example, "regulation of rhebgtpase activity by ampk" from reactome contains  <dig> genes that are all present in the "insulin signaling" pathway from kegg with  <dig> genes. this situation is typical when aggregating data sources that contain general pathways and pathways that represent specific sub-pathways of the general pathways. of the  <dig>  pathways,  <dig>  of them are exact subsets of at least one other pathway. while this might seem to offer a way to significantly consolidate pathways, there exist overlapping pathway gene sets that make consolidation difficult. for example, "endothelins" from nci nature and "trail signaling pathway" of nci nature contain all of the  <dig> genes of the "il <dig> pathway" from biocarta, but "endothelins" and "trail signaling pathway" are not subsets of each other, making it impossible to combine them by grouping subsets with supersets. therefore "il <dig> pathway" cannot be labelled as a subset of a single pathway, in this case only as a subset of two pathways.

in addition to membership comparison, several methods have been proposed to accomplish pathway clustering by pathway activity similarity . mamitsuka et al.  <cit>  proposed a method based on markov mixture models that relies on microarray expression and the graph of a metabolic pathway. li et al.  <cit>  proposed a method that clusters sub-pathways according to diseases. because of the diversity of representations of pathways among the publically available databases, we relied on the most simple representation of pathways, their gene members. similarly, it is possible to find microarray expression values for the gene members, like fang et al.  <cit> , however we chose to keep our gene sets unbiased for specific microarray studies. while this information might be advantageous in specific applications, for many systems biology studies, a generic approach is desired.

one online integrate pathway repository, hpd  <cit> , computes a similarity score for all pathway pairs based on overlapping gene sets. a user then can visualize the scores in an "association table". through visualization a user would be able to see similar pathways. another repository, hipathdb, only lists all of the pathways that contain at least one of the input genes with no means for determining pathway overlap. we propose three different methods to consolidate multiple pathways into one pathway concept. each provides a slightly different analysis of the concepts describing a single experiment. figure  <dig> illustrates how different methods of analysis can draw attention to different aspects of the same data. hierarchical clustering by gene expression  shows how the absolute expression values for each gene changes over the time course data. alternatively, clustering by pathway expression  highlights pathway activity over the time course data. taken together, they provide complementary, but different views of the same data. our consolidation methods also provide complementary, but different views of the pathway concepts that represent an experiment's resultant gene set. one is tightly associated with the results from gene expression experiments consolidating only enriched pathways. another uses pathway pair scoring, comparing not only the overlap of the resultant genes, but also weighting by shared interactions between the pathways. this method consolidates both enriched and non-enriched pathways. the third method, independent of any given resultant gene set, combines pathways with other pathways using their gene member and the gene member annotations like ontology or interacting pairs. the first and second pathway consolidation methods combine gene set membership and gene expression analysis to create a consolidated list of pathways specific to the condition studied in the analysis. therefore, it is tailored to a specific experiment. the third measures the overlap of two sets by a variety of criteria and then groups pathways with the greatest similarity. this creates a set of grouped pathways independent of any experiment that is used for gene set enrichment.

methods
data collection
all human pathway data presented here were downloaded from four primary data repositories, biocarta, wikipathways, ncbi biosystems and pathway commons representing six data sets . biocarta , kegg , nci nature  and humancyc  were contained in one of the data sources as indicated, however reactome  and wikipathways  were contained in two different repositories. for those situations where the names matched between sources the gene identifiers were combined.  <dig>  pathways were determined from biocarta, kegg, nci nature, wikipathways, reactome and humancyc.  <dig> pathways with no gene members were removed leaving  <dig>  pathways with at least one gene member.

annotations including gene ontology   <cit>  and protein interactions  <cit>  were downloaded along with go slim annotations for the go entries.

two gene expression data sets were obtained. the first  <cit>  was used to test our consolidation methods and is provided as an example in the pathway distiller framework. gene expression profiles by affymetrix hg-u95av <dig> were measured at five different time points after treatment with cisplatin in the human ovarian cancer cell a <dig>  after normalization and filtering steps, thresholding of log-fold-change at  <dig>  was performed to generate  <dig> differentially expressed gene sets that were further combined to form a single resultant gene set  that represents this experiment over any time point. the background gene set contained all of the probes of affymetrix hg-u95av <dig>  regardless of expression level that map to ncbi entrez geneids .

pathway enrichment and consolidation
one-sided fisher's exact test finds p-values for all pathways that contains at least  <dig> of the user supplied resultant gene set compared to the human genome or a user supplied background gene set. three methods were developed to focus on different but complementary cluster types for the resulting pathways. one method focuses only on enriched pathways unique to the experiment's resultant gene set. another method clusters both enriched and non-enriched pathways using scores derived from interactions within each pathway involving the resultant genes. the final method independent of the resultant gene set finds cluster of pathways based on gene membership, go ontology and protein-protein interactions. this is the only method that can be pre-determined, independent of experiments' resultant gene lists.

a. consolidation of enriched pathways
given the initial resultant gene set and the initial most enriched pathway, we iteratively reduce the list of enriched pathways and the resultant gene set by removing the genes in the most enriched pathway from the resultant gene set and recomputing enrichment p-values for the remaining pathways using the reduced gene set. any pathway that is no longer enriched is consolidated with the most enriched pathway for this iteration. because each iteration starts with removal of shared genes based on enrichment p-values, the order of gene removal is different for each resultant gene set and therefore specific to that experiment. we perform the consolidation procedure as follows,

pathway consolidation procedure 1: enrichment consolidation

1) start with a set of all enriched pathways , or s <dig> = {si: pi_fisher ≤  <dig> }, where d is the differential expressed gene set or resultant gene set, pi_fisher is the enrichment p-value of pathway si in gene set d; a set of genes supporting all pathways, or g <dig> = {gk: gk ∈ any si}, and initialized the selected pathways set p <dig> = ∅;

2) find the most enriched pathway sj where sj ∈ s <dig> & pj ≤ pi, for all i ≠ j;

3) upon obtaining sj, we update s <dig> = {s0\sj}, g <dig> = {g0\gk; gk ∈ sj}, and selected pathway set p <dig> = p <dig> ∪ {sj};

4) update pathway enrichment p-values, since we removed genes contained in sj from all other pathways;

5) update remaining pathway set by removing non-significant pathways after removing genes contained in previous enriched pathway, s <dig> = {s1\si: pi_fisher >  <dig> }; and

6) repeat steps 2- <dig>  stop when sm = ∅.

by starting with the most enriched pathway each iteration, each pathway concept is represented by the most enriched pathways for the resultant gene set.

b. weighted consolidation with resultant genes
weighted consolidation first orders pathway pairs by scores that incorporate information about the number of overlapping resultant genes and the interactions among those resultant genes. second, it adds each pair from highest to lowest score into a cluster. for weighting we followed the method outlined by fang et al.  <cit>  to determine weight  for each gene  within each of the pathways  by comparing the number of known and predicted interactions  <cit>  between gi and the other genes in sj, against the number of known and predicted interactions between gi and the other genes in the genome. suppose that gi has no specific functional association with genes in pathway sj; then the number of interactions xi of gi to others in a given pathway is expected to follow a hypergeometric distribution,

  p=mixn-mikj-xnkj 

where mi is the number of interactions of gi to others in the genome, n is the number genes in the genome, and kj is the number of genes in pathway sj with the expected number of interactions e of gene i derived as

  e=mikjn 

for gene gi, i =  <dig>   <dig>  ..., kj. the observed number of interactions between genes in sj is likely to be significantly larger than e, when there is a specific function association of gi in pathway sj, thus a larger weight. in the algorithm, they rescaled this weight to quantify the relative association strength wi of gi as,

  wi=xi-e, 

  wi=log <dig> wi> <dig> wi≤ <dig> 

although fang et al. included co-expression and functional annotation associations between genes, we limited the association count to the interactions found in one of our earlier implementations of the protein interaction database, interologfinder  <cit> . gene expression could be determined for the gene members, however the experiments themselves are tissue and condition specific. we chose to leave pathway distiller unbiased for any one experiment by not incorporating gene expression information.

the pathway consolidation procedure is implemented by utilizing a similarity score confined to the resultant gene set, d, with weights generated from the number of interactions within a given pathway. upon obtaining a similarity score  for each pathway pair, we iteratively process the pathway pairs from high to low scores either adding them to existing clusters or forming a new cluster with the pair. specifically, we perform the consolidation procedure as follows,

pathway consolidation procedure 2: weighted consolidation

1) start with a set of all pathways ; a resultant gene set, d, is also required;

2) determine a similarity score for each pathway pair where the weights for overlapping resultant genes between the pathways are compared against the weights between all resultant genes in the pathway pair,

  similarity=∑gk∈wk∑gk∈∩d)wk 

3) for each unique pathway pair, ordered by their similarity score, add one, both or neither pathway to a cluster ck that is a member of all clusters c = {ck} and made up of a set of pathways.

a. if neither si nor sj already belong to a cluster in c, create a new cluster c' = {si, sj}, add cluster c' to c;

b. if si is an element of ck, but sj is not a member of any cluster in c, add sj to ck, similarly handled vice versa;

c. if both si and sj are members of any cluster in c, do nothing.

4) repeat step 3) for all pathway pairs.

c. de novo pathway clustering
to cluster pathways without experimental information, a hierarchical clustering-based method was developed in matlab using the statistics toolbox . after finding similarity measurements between pathways, the linkage algorithm is used to link pairs of pathways to form a hierarchical cluster tree. the cluster function was used to either choose a particular cut-off threshold for groupings, or to choose how many clusters the user desires. as shown in figure  <dig>  the clustering is effectively a horizontal cut of the clustering dendrogram. the number of clusters is relative to the minimum jaccard coefficient  <cit>  threshold required to combine clusters when each pathway starts in its own cluster. by choosing different cluster count thresholds, the user can have different similarity requirements. the lower the cut-off threshold the fewer the number of clusters and the more pathways grouped in each cluster. to find an actual measure of pathway similarity, the jaccard coefficient and distance are used as shown in  and .

  j=|ai∩aj||ai∪aj| 

  di,j=1-j 

where |·| is the cardinality of a set, and si and sj are ith and jth pathways similarly defined earlier, and ai and aj are attributes of genes in pathways si and sj. a total of three different gene attributes were looked at as the common term: 1) gene membership, 2) "guilt-by-function" via gene ontology, and 3) "guilt-by-association" via protein-protein interactants. our algorithm handles all in the same manner by finding the jaccard distance between two pathways based on set commonality. this forms a jaccard matrix, that represents the similarities between all pathways.

for pathway consolidation based on gene ontology and protein-protein interactions, a map was created to link pathways to goslim terms, and to protein-protein interactants creating new member sets from the original sets used in  and . or

  ai←{gi;gi∈sj}⋃gi∈sjgoslim⋃gi∈sjppi 

the mapping in  takes each gene in the pathway, or creates a new set including the goslim ancestors of the original gene's go terms, goslim; or creates a new set including any gene that is known to interact with the genes known to be in the pathway ppi. the exact procedure is follows,

pathway consolidation procedure 3: de novo consolidation

1) start with a set of all pathways , or si = {gi}.

2) determine the method of similarity measure , and then evaluation jaccard coefficient by eqs. 6-7;

3) perform hierarchical clustering to obtain desired specificity of pathway clusters defined by the user. user indicates jaccard score cut-off, which defines the clustering stop point.

pathway distiller framework
we developed a web-based application, the pathway distiller , which provides access to our integrated pathway database base, pathway enrichment and three methods of pathway consolidation. it builds on the sidekick  <cit>  framework. pathway distiller was built using adobe flex and action script  <dig> which produces a adobe flash movie that runs in a user's web browser. the back-end automatic data download, processing and query availability was created using the sidecache  <cit>  framework that is implemented in java and designed to run as a java servlet in a container such as apache tomcat  <cit> . users can upload a set of genes  to access all components of the pathway distiller functions or use a supplied sample gene set. the de novo pathway clusters are also available for download.

RESULTS
using the pathway distiller framework as outlined in figure  <dig>  we describe the process of taking a resultant gene list  and finding enriched pathway concepts  that provide function insights for the genomic data. further, we outline how the various consolidation methods find different descriptions of the resulting pathway concepts related to the supplied resultant gene list.

cisplatin case study and framework use case
the web-based application, pathway distiller, as shown in figure  <dig> and accessible at http://cbbiweb.uthscsa.edu/pathwaydistiller, facilitates resultant gene set analysis using pathway enrichment and consolidation. using the supplied cisplatin resultant gene set as a use case, we import  the  <dig> differential expressed genes induced by cisplatin treatment  and the  <dig> background genes . the user is able to upload their own resultant gene set and background gene set using the upload file button. the background gene set could be all of the probes for a given microarray platform, while the resultant gene set would include only the differentially expressed genes. by default , the entire gene set of human genome will be used as the background. in step  <dig>  we leave the default option  to find the enrichment score for each of the  <dig>  pathways maintained by our backend data management module. the user is able to limit the pathway sources. step  <dig>  fills the enrichment results grid with the pathways with at least one of the resultant genes. for the cisplatin case study, this results in  <dig> pathways. step  <dig>  fills the consolidation results grid. the default method, pathway enrichment , provides the  <dig> pathway concepts mostly closely aligned with the enrichment results. step  <dig>  displays the results of the other consolidation methods. additional features of pathway distiller include flexible viewing options and links to external data sources for most of the pathways and genes. a more thorough use case is available on the pathway distiller website including screen shots explaining pathway distiller's functionality.

in our cisplatin case study, by sorting the grid by enrichment score,  <dig> pathways were found to be significantly enriched with p-value ≤  <dig>  . after the pathways are consolidated, the user is able to choose from all of the consolidation methods using the consolidation method drop down box. this displays the pathway concepts , their member pathways, the clustering score and the number of pathways within the pathway concept. each pathway concept, is labelled with the most significant pathway in the group. the clustering score for each method is the lowest enrichment score of the individual pathways within the cluster.

for our cisplatin example, the consolidation results grid first displays the ec consolidation results providing insight into the similarity of the significantly enriched pathways highly according to the resultant gene list's pathway enrichment. by choosing the weighted consolidation  option, the user finds pathway concepts related to the specific input resultant gene set, however it includes all of the  <dig>  pathways with at least one cisplatin-induced differentially expressed gene. of the  <dig> pathway concepts for the ec method,  <dig> of them contains  <dig> pathways and  <dig> of them contain a single pathway. the wc method finds a maximum of  <dig> and minimum of  <dig> pathways in the  <dig> pathway concepts.

when more specific functional insights are required, by choosing from the  <dig> de novo consolidation methods  a user is able to have more fine-tuned control of both the means to measure pathway similarity and the number of concepts to determine. the dc naming convention pathway distiller uses is as follows, the first half of each option in step  <dig> indicates the gene attribute from which the jaccard score is derived. specifically, membership will provide gene membership, goslim "guilt-by-function" via gene ontology, and ppi "guilt-by-association" via gene interactions. each attribute is further subdivided into  <dig> cluster count thresholds indicated in the second half of the dc naming convention. cut-offs of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> provide the user fined-tuned control of the number of expected clusters and the resulting size of each cluster. together with ec and wc, the dc results for the cisplatin-induced differentially expressed genes are described in the first two columns of table  <dig>  in step  <dig>  choosing goslim <dig>  displays the  <dig> pathway concepts with at least one of the  <dig> pathways . of these two concepts only one of them contains a significantly enriched pathway . membership <dig> and ppi <dig> each only produce  <dig> concept that overlaps the pathways with at least  <dig> cisplatin resultant gene. in step  <dig>  goslim <dig>  displays the  <dig> pathway concepts with at least one of the  <dig> pathways and by sorting  <dig> of them contain at least one enriched pathway. summarized in the table, membership <dig> and ppi <dig> find larger number of concepts than their corresponding  <dig> cut-offs  and of these even fewer contain enriched pathways . the final dc type/cut-off combination of  <dig> for goslim, membership and ppi finds  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> concepts with  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> concepts with at least one enriched pathway for each, respectively.

note: n/a - indicates all pathways formed a single cluster

as expected in the fine-tuning of the dc methods the maximal number of pathways in pathway concepts decreases as the number of pathways increases. for example all of the  <dig> pathways with at least one cisplatin induced differentially expressed gene are clustered together for goslim <dig>  however the maximal number of pathways in a pathway concept for goslim <dig> is  <dig>  in table  <dig>  we additionally provide results for allowing  <dig> and  <dig> clusters to demonstrate the incremental gain of number of pathway concepts, thus provide precise description of the input gene set.

the correct cut-off level is dependent on the user's needs both in terms acceptable size and number of clusters and interest in specific pathways. for example, if a user is interested in a specific group of pathways using a lower cut-off like  <dig> combines them into the same cluster with very few other pathways, this cut-off would be appropriate. in membership <dig>  the sphingolipid metabolism cluster contains only  <dig> pathways which is very manageable. however, at the same cut-off, the nucleotide metabolism cluster contains  <dig> which might be too large to inspect. using membership <dig> reduces the nucleotide metabolism cluster to  <dig> pathways.

we investigated whether the pathway concepts obtained from the ec and wc algorithms are significant when compared to random draws of the same number of genes from the genome. we assume that genes contained in these pathways concepts show much stronger interaction, comparing to genes randomly selected from the genome. table  <dig> shows the p-values of the number interactions of genes within pathways concepts when comparing to the same number of genes drawn at random  <dig> times. other than  <dig> pathway concepts , genes in most pathway concepts show significantly strong interaction.

note: p-value is derived from χ2goodness of fit

overview of table 3- <dig> organization
tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> show results from a variety of resultant gene sets. the tables are organized with rows of pathways and in each column how the pathways are grouped in that consolidation method. the columns are divided to facilitate reading the tables in column-wise directions. in other words, the divisions of a column show how one clustering methods groups the pathway rows. each division represents a pathway concept. pathways that do not consolidate into pathway concepts are not contained in their own division and do not share similar symbols.

note: matching symbols in a column indicate shared cluster membership. n/a indicates non-enriched pathway not included in any cluster. dividers and matching symbols indicate pathways groups within a consolidation method.

note: recq helicases and atpase were not found among the human pathways. p-values are derived from one-tail fisher's exact test, before multiple test correction. dividers and matching symbols indicate pathways groups within a consolidation method.

p <dig> related pathway analysis
as a drill-down example, table  <dig> shows consolidation results of seven pathways related to p <dig>  cisplatin is one of the most effective and widely used anticancer drugs. it is generally considered as a cytotoxic drug which kills cancer cells by damaging dna and inhibiting dna synthesis. on the other hand, the tumor suppressor protein p <dig> is considered as the "guardian of genome" <cit> . it plays a critical role in eliciting cellular responses to cisplatin-induced dna damage. to start the de novo consolidation, the de novo clustering methods based on gene membership, gene ontology, and protein-protein interaction were set for  <dig> clusters . for de novo membership,  <dig> pathway concepts were obtained  containing  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> pathways respectively. similarly, de novo gene ontology groups these pathways into  <dig> pathway concepts  with  <dig> and  <dig> pathways respectively. when we tried to group pathways by de novo ppi, all  <dig> pathways  listed in table  <dig> were grouped together. as indicated by the different divisions, each method determines unique clusters, however, it is clear some of these p <dig> related pathways serve similar functions across different concept consolidation methods. specifically, "direct p <dig> effectors" and "p <dig> pathways" are always grouped together, with "p <dig> signaling pathway" possibly included in this group. by finding pathway concepts based on a variety of gene attributes, different functional connections are determined between the pathways.

mms case study
to demonstrate the capability of examining gene sets at pathway level, we also tested a second gene set that mimic the effect of cisplatin-induced dna damage and inhibition of dna synthesis. ravi et al.  <cit>  used a cell-based rnai screen against the drosophila genome and the alkylating agent methyl methanesulphonate . the screen determined a resultant set with  <dig> drosophila genes required for dna damage survival. using this gene set they identified  <dig> pathways integral to dna damage response. to compare their pathway analysis between two studies, we used ensembl  <cit>  to convert the drosophila genes to  <dig> ncbi entrez geneids for the human orthologs.

the pathways found to be integral to dna damage response included base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, homologous recombination repair, recq helicases, dna damage response, proteasome, glutathione synthesis, tor pathway, basal transcription, ribosome, atpase, and notch signaling pathway. all of the pathways had equivalent human pathways except for recq helicases and atpase. using their resultant fly gene set converted to human orthologs we found enrichment scores for each, described in table  <dig>  together with ec and wc, we performed de novo consolidation method with a cut-off of  <dig> clusters. in table  <dig>  we show each pathway's membership for clusters formed for each method. for de novo ppi, all pathways except glutathione synthesis were found in the same pathway concept . for de novo membership, notch and tor pathways formed a separate concept  and for de novo goslim, base excision repair and mismatch repair formed a separate concept . ec separated everything into different clusters. wc combined base excision repair, mismatch repair, homologous recombination repair and dna damage response  and separated every other pathway.

hpd comparison
chowbina et al.  <cit>  determine  <dig> hpd pathways that contain some combination of the brca <dig>  foxa <dig> and stk <dig> genes. we downloaded their pathway list and pathway - pathway similarity scores and by hand, found  <dig> pathway pairs with similarity score of  <dig>  or higher among  <dig> of the original  <dig> pathways. their similarity score is derived from pathway similarity based on pathway components . the pathways were aurora a signaling , signaling by aurora kinases , aurora b signaling , foxa transcription factor networks , foxa <dig> transcription factor network , foxa <dig> and foxa <dig> transcription factor networks , atrbrca_pathway , and fanconi anemia pathway . indicated in table  <dig> column  <dig>  using hpd's similarity score, we grouped the aurora, foxa, atrbrca/fanconi anemia, and atm/repair of double-strand breaks pathways. pathway distiller finds  <dig> pathways that contain some combination of the brca <dig>  foxa <dig> and stk <dig> genes and  <dig> of them are enriched with a p-value less than  <dig> . we tested if the different consolidation methods will cluster the  <dig> pathways like hpd. described in table  <dig>  membership <dig> was the most similar to hpd's similarity group, exactly matching the foxa and atm/repair of double-strand breaks pathways . this similarity is to be expected because both hpd and membership use gene set similarity as the scoring mechanism. highlighted in the remaining columns of table  <dig>  pathway distiller's other methods, each utilizing different similarity measurements, find slightly different pathway groups.

we also extended our analysis of tp <dig> by compared hpd and pathway distiller's analysis of a single gene by searching on "p53" in hpd and inputting a file with "7157" in pathway distiller. both yield all pathways that contain tp <dig>  for hpd, we determined  <dig> pathways that group together into  <dig> clusters. by manual name comparison, we determined pathways similar to  <dig> of hpd's pathways. described in table  <dig>  the  <dig> pathway distiller pathways map to four different hpd similarity groups . the cell cycle pathways were not grouped with any of the other pathways. the akt, dna repair and mapk pathways were grouped. finally all of the disease related pathways were grouped. our de novo membership, was most similar to hpd's groups and ppi the least similar, grouping all  <dig> pathways  together. only the de novo methods were included in table  <dig> because with a single gene resultant gene set, by definition, ec and wc will group all pathways.

discussion
merging several pathway data sources allows for better coverage of existing information but is difficult because of the heterogeneous nature of the member pathways. a simple solution reduces the information for each pathway to its gene members. while this loses information that could be used to cluster pathways like directionality, we see that our consolidation methods achieve consolidation both de novo and with the experimentally focused data. the resulting pathway concepts are made up of pathways that have been found to share some functional characteristics. using various methods for consolidation enables different views of the same data. for example, ppi and wc offer users consolidation based on interactions which could provide mechanisms for understanding how pathways are interconnected within a single concept. goslim on the other hand, focuses on functional connections according to go ontology annotations. even within a single de novo method we provide various cut-offs that can find general to very specific measured similarities between pathways within a cluster. as each method has strengths, they also have weaknesses. the ec method is limited to only enriched pathways and will miss any non-enriched pathway. because the other methods utilize a single measurement to assess similarity, they will sometimes miss connections that exist when the measurement does not fit the data.

for most research, ec and wc will provide the best overview of pathway concepts related to experiment specific enriched pathways and all pathways. because ec is tightly aligned with enrichment results researchers interested in only connections between enriched pathways will typically rely on this method. however because wc includes non-enriched pathways, it is possible to find connections between enriched and non-enriched pathways.

discussed further later, we saw that wc failed for methionine degradation i in our random testing even when the testing was based on interactions. this was due to the lack of interactions between the few gene members. however as we also saw in table  <dig>  this failure was mitigated by the successful concept development of the same pathway using ec. while we recognize that the goal of many pathway analysis tools is to find a single results and some confidence score, pathway distiller seeks to facilitate exploration of various results to aid a user in finding distinct functional connections between pathways in a pathway concept.

pathway distiller's supplied resultant gene set  is a good example of one of the challenges that our pathway enrichment consolidation addresses. the  <dig> pathways with p-values ≤  <dig>  are difficult to draw conclusions from. shown in table  <dig>  the enrichment consolidation  method reduces this to  <dig> pathway concepts, each represented by the most enriched among the pathways consolidated. this enables focused attention and readability. while the ec method only groups enriched pathways, the weighted consolidation  method groups all pathways with at least one resultant gene. out of the  <dig>  human pathways, for example, there are  <dig>  pathways with one of the cisplatin resultant genes that results in  <dig> pathway concepts. while this is too large compared with the ec method, it offers a different pathway description precision of the resultant gene set. because it is not limited to enriched pathways, enriched and not enriched pathways are combined. our web-based pathway distiller's result tables are column sortable and therefore we are able to find the lowest p-value for each pathway concept. in the case of cisplatin resultant gene set, there are  <dig> pathway concepts with at least one enriched pathway, much larger than  <dig> pathway concepts generated by ec method however small enough to browse for interesting information.

often it is important to incorporate specific enrichment values within a single experimental design, for instance across time points in a single cell line treated with a compound. but among diverse experiments the most enriched pathway in one might have no relationship to another experiment. a de novo method for consolidating pathways independent of specific experiments that still handles the problems of set matching and numerical identification of subset similarity allows empirical comparison and consistent results. like the wc method, both enriched and non-enriched pathways are included, however all gene members of each pathway were used to determine clusters, not only the resultant genes. table  <dig> highlights the variation between the clustering methods and within the de novo methods with different cut-off values.

measuring the number of interactions among a set of genes gives an estimation of their functional relatedness. the probabilities in the first column of table  <dig> indicates that the interactions are unique among most pathway concepts and not due to random sampling of genes for the pathway concept found using the ec method. clearly, in almost all of the cases, the pathway concepts are not combined without some relationship among the pathways as measured by interactions. the second column measures the randomness of the interactions in the matching clusters of the wc method. this method of validation fails for three of the pathway concepts we tested, two in ec and one in wc. this illustrates well the advantage of not using a "one size fits all" approach to consolidation. the two pathway concepts that fail for ec  both have few pathway gene members  and few interactions . both matching clusters were significant for the wc method because each concept contains a slightly different set of member pathways. interestingly, methionine degradation i  fails in wc but was significant in ec again due to a slightly different set of member pathways. it is surprising that it fails in the interaction based validation when it was clustered due to weighted interactions until it is considered that there was only a single interaction among the genes in the concept, and this one interaction was very specialized to the pathway members of the concept.

tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> highlight the strengths of our consolidation methods. the tables should be read in a column-wise format; they include dividers to facilitate this. in other words, the divisions show how one clustering methods groups the pathway rows. each division configuration represents a different way to cluster the rows of pathways.

from table  <dig>  one would expect grouping of pathways with a common relationship to p <dig>  gene ontology divides the  <dig> pathways into two different clusters and the two different clusters have significance in terms of normal cells and those dealing with dna damage response. protein interactions and the ec method group all pathways together. gene membership and wc method group the  <dig> pathways into three and four pathway concepts respectively. the wc method follows the grouping of the gene membership except it separates the p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways, clearly offering different precision of pathway representation.

not only does pathway consolidation make the data more manageable, readable and publishable, it could focus attention to pathways not previously considered. for example, ravi et al.  <cit>  determined  <dig> pathways related to dna damage response,  <dig> corresponding human pathways are shown in table  <dig>  similar to their findings, when we utilized the human ortholog resultant gene set for their rnai screen, not all of the pathways were enriched, therefore simple enrichment methods would fail to draw attention to one of these pathways. our different but complementary consolidation methods can group both enriched and non-enriched pathways together. for example, gene membership <dig> finds base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, homologous recombination repair  and dna damage response all together in a single concept . only nucleotide excision repair would have been apparent in the initial pathway enrichment step with a p-value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  but, by looking at pathways also clustered with nucleotide excision repair in the consolidation results grid, one might find connections between enriched and non-enriched pathways. ravi et al. created a similar hypothesis of connections between these pathways by hand. in this example, all pathways except for glutathione metabolism are contained in the same concept in at least one method and some are in the same concept for all methods. because glutathione metabolism is never clustered with the other pathways this offers a chance for exploration of the differences between glutathione metabolism and the other pathways. similarly, the possible functional connections between notch and tor pathways  and base excise repair and mismatch repair  might lead to novel avenues for research.

pathway distiller found  <dig> and  <dig> enriched pathways when processing the mms and tp <dig> case studies, respectively. functional connections in the form of interactions, gene membership and go ontology between pathways will enable users to focus attention on meaningful groups instead of many individual members.

in the second comparison with hpd, their similarity scores placed mapk signaling pathway and the cancer pathways into different clusters. mapk signaling pathway was included in the cancer related cluster for pathway distiller's membership <dig> cluster. pathway distiller also includes bladder, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, chronic myeloid leukemia, thyroid, prostate, and small cell lung cancers. dhillion et al.  <cit>  describe how mapk features prominently in cancer. in retrospect, the membership <dig> cluster could have hinted at the same conclusion.

CONCLUSIONS
pathway enrichment is an important tool when making sense of gene expression data, however the information must be in a form conducive to examination and evaluation. each of the publically available pathway data sources has strengths and weaknesses. in order to exploit the information, the combination of these data sources is essential, but only if we can avoid overlapping and maintain the independence between the pathway concepts. the proposed pathway consolidation is important to make the combined data manageable, but still accurately describing the original data. three methods were discussed in the paper: one focusing on pathways determined enriched in a given experiment, another looks at both enriched and non-enriched pathways, but using only the experiment's resultant genes, and the final grouping the pathways in a de novo, experiment independent manner. in addition, the web-based pathway distiller implementation  will enable access to a variety of pathway data sources, pathway enrichment given resultant gene sets and our diverse consolidation methods. the default option consolidation method, enrichment consolidation and weighted consolidation, are the most descriptive representation of the enrichment results, but the other methods offer additional views of the results focusing on gene annotation information and the overlap of enriched and non-enriched pathways within concepts.

pathway distiller will benefit a scientist who needs a simple-to-use yet sophisticated pathway consolidation and enrichment method to find functional insight for their genotypic data. it allows them to use four steps to retrieve concept grouping and then the additional ability to further explore concept relationships if desired.
