BACKGROUND
bacteriophages  are naturally occurring predators of bacteria that are ubiquitous in the environment; they are almost certainly the most abundant biological entities on the planet  <cit> . it is commonly accepted that phage genomes are an extremely rich source of novel and unique dna sequences, and that phage genomes are highly variable, often showing a mosaic patchwork of genetic segments acquired from a range of sources including other phages and bacteria. however, this view is almost certainly an oversimplification; as more phage genomes become available it is clear that closely related phage lineages exist in the environment which may be stable over appreciable time-scales and geographic areas  <cit> . understanding how these lineages evolve and adapt to their hosts will provide useful insights into the phage pan-genome, genetic flux within communities and phage genome stability.

the general availability of phages in the environment coupled with their ease of isolation and cultivation has led them to be used in a variety of ways. phages have been instrumental in the development of molecular biology, their use as typing tools for bacterial pathogens continues today and recently there has been a resurgence of interest in phage intervention to control pathogens, so called 'bacteriophage therapy'. the closely related zoonotic pathogens campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli are major causes of infectious bacterial gastroenteritis in humans  <cit> , and have been associated with rare but serious, sometimes fatal, neurological sequelae such as guillain-barré syndrome, miller-fisher syndrome and the onset of reactive arthritis  <cit> . using phages to reduce campylobacter at multiple stages of the food chain is a promising sustainable intervention strategy but requires detailed knowledge of phage genomes at the sequence level. although previous studies have shown that the application of phages can effectively reduce campylobacter contamination  <cit> , to date the most common use of campylobacter phages has been in typing schemes allowing the discrimination between different campylobacter isolates  <cit> . previous studies have shown that all the campylobacter phages examined to date belong to either the myoviridae or siphoviridae tailed phage families  <cit> . based on genome size, they have been categorized into three groups; group iii  <dig> -  <dig> kb, group ii  <dig> -  <dig> kb and the typing phages nctc  <dig> and nctc  <dig>  which are reported to be ~ <dig> kb in size, as group i  <cit> . molecular characterization of these phages has been slow, with many of the currently available campylobacter phages being extremely refractory to genomic analysis. in many cases phage genomic dna is resistant to digestion with any of the standard restriction endonucleases, although, hhai has proven to be useful to discriminate some group iii phages  <cit> . however, thorough characterization of campylobacter specific phages  is a prerequisite to avoid the inadvertent transfer or mobilization of harmful genes  <cit> .

in this work we report the first full genome sequences, analysis of virion proteins and the genome analysis for two large virulent campylobacter specific phages; cp <dig> a phage isolated from chickens in  <dig>  <cit>  and cpt <dig> a member of the uk campylobacter typing scheme phages, isolated from a slaughterhouse environment prior to  <dig>  <cit> . both display typical genome sizes for group ii phages, a morphology typical of the myoviridae phages  <cit>  and exhibit broad but different host ranges with both phages notably able to lyse campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli isolates. the genome sequences illuminate a very highly conserved campylobacter specific phage lineage that has survived the ongoing competition between host and virus.

RESULTS
genome structure
two virulent campylobacter phages have been sequenced to reveal double stranded dna genomes of  <dig>  <dig> bp  and  <dig>  <dig> bp , a comparison of the genomes can be found in table  <dig>  the full annotated genome sequences have been deposited with the embl nucleotide sequence database with accession numbers; cp <dig>  and cpt <dig> . these phages have a gc content comparable to that found in the host species,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % for c. jejuni nctc  <dig>  rm <dig> and c. coli rm <dig> respectively  <cit> . both the cp <dig> and cpt <dig> genomes show a distinct strand bias for putative protein coding sequences ,  with the majority of the cdss lying on the 'forward' strand, an observation in accordance with that for many other phages where a similar bias in orientation is observed  <cit> . in many bacterial species predominant gene orientation is frequently parallel to the direction of replication of the forward strand, thus minimising interference between rna transcription and dna replication. however, both phage genomes contain notable exceptions to this strand bias, including two distinct sections of dna where contiguous runs of cdss lie on the reverse strand .

b the number of cds regions and the coding density is based on the proportion of the genome covered by discrete coding regions. it does not account for cds regions produced from internal initiation sites or alternative gene products produced by splicing, post-translational processing or other mechanisms that may increase the number of protein products produced from the genome.

in most cases the strand alignment of the open reading frames is supported by the apparent change in strand ag content, with a distinct preference for a and g bases in the coding strand. this bias was also reflected in the codon usage  <cit> . comparison of the codon usage frequencies from the entire genome sequences of cp <dig> and cpt <dig> and from several c. jejuni and c. coli genome sequences reveals that in cases where synonymous codons are available, the phages show a preference for alternative codons to those employed by campylobacters . there is a small but definite bias towards codons with a or u at the third position, which probably reflects the high a+t content of these phage genomes, although as noted above the phage genomes closely match that of host campylobacters in terms of their overall base composition.

the phages carry tandem trna genes with arginine and tyrosine type anticodons. unusually, the tyr-trna in cp <dig> shows a single base substitution in a highly conserved trna residue but it is not clear how this base change would impact on function. examination of the phage codon usage shows that the two codons recognized by these trnas are represented more frequently in the phage coding regions than in campylobacter, and thus probably explains the evolutionary pressure for their retention. what is perhaps more surprising is that these phages don't carry more trna genes, for example t <dig> encodes eight trnas  <cit> , as there are a number of other codons that are represented more frequently in phage cdss than in campylobacter. the codon preferences observed could be an evolutionary relic, considering the wide range of organisms that appear to have contributed to the phage genomes, or it may be a strategy to fully utilize the available trna pools in campylobacter to maintain key host functions whilst translating phage proteins necessary for replication and reproduction.

of the  <dig> and  <dig> predicted cdss identified for cpt <dig> and cp <dig> respectively, some show significant conservation  to a range of structural and enzymatic proteins from phage t <dig> . proteins gp <dig>  and gp <dig>  are both represented in the campylobacter phage sequences with identity to the corresponding t <dig> proteins of 28% and 31% respectively. the observation of sequence conservation suggests that these phages belong to the diverse t4-like phage superfamily but somewhat distant to the archetypal member of the group. the overall architecture of the genome appears to follow a modular construction, with most of the phage structural and dna replication genes clustered in the left and right arms of the genomes as represented in figure  <dig>  while the central third of the genome comprises a much more heterogeneous selection of genes involved with metabolic processes. however, in common with other phage genome sequences, a large proportion of putative cdss 85/ <dig> from cp <dig> and 95/ <dig> from cpt <dig> show no significant matches to sequences currently deposited in databases.

direct comparison of the two genomes reveals an extremely high level of conservation , with an average nucleotide identity over the entire length of the phage chromosomes of  <dig> %. so high is the conservation between these two phages it is possible to identify the boundaries of insertion or deletion events encompassing discrete cdss. comparison of the genomes revealed that  <dig> cdss are unique to cp <dig> and  <dig> are unique to cpt <dig>  the majority of these have no significant matches to database sequences, however, two of the unique sequences in cpt <dig> code for putative dna methyltranferases not present in cp <dig>  cpt10_ <dig> shares 59% identity  with a type iii restriction/modification methyltranferase subunit from campylobacter jejuni. although the gene has a confirmed frame-shift mutation in a poly-adenosine tract towards the distal end of the gene, the full-length product could still be expressed through a process of transcriptional slippage  <cit> . the second putative methyltranferase, cpt10_ <dig>  shows similarity to dna methyltranferases from both clostridium and campylobacter sp. cp <dig> and cpt <dig> have different campylobacter host ranges , the two identified methyltranferases may enable cpt <dig> to avoid host restriction defences in some strains through modification of its own dna. in addition methylation is known to be involved in control of gene expression in many organisms and these enzymes may be involved in such a process during cpt <dig> infection, either through modification of its own dna or by modification and possibly silencing of host gene expression.

the largest region differentiating these two phages is a cluster encoding  <dig> cdss in cpt <dig>  and  <dig> in cp <dig>  the two clusters show little relationship at the nucleotide or amino-acid sequence level but show remarkable functional conservation, where five cdss from each cluster possess conserved radical s-adenosylmethionine  domains and each cluster appears to posses a putative glycine amidinotransferase. these regions are unlikely to have diverged from a common progenitor as this would require localised mutation rates in these regions to be much higher than in the surrounding phage genome. it is more likely these sequences have been acquired en masse from a related organism, whether phage or bacterial, by homologous or non-homologous recombination.

in total there are  <dig> proteins belonging to the radical sam superfamily in cp <dig> and  <dig> in cpt <dig>  radical sam proteins are involved in the cleavage of unreactive c--h bonds in a range of biochemical processes as diverse as dna repair, lysine metabolism and the generation of vitamins and cofactors such as biotin, heme and thiamine  <cit> . the presence of so many radical sam proteins in these phage genomes is highly unusual. approximately  <dig>  proteins have so far been assigned to this superfamily, of these the overwhelming majority  are bacterial proteins, with only around  <dig> having been identified in phage genomes thus far  <cit> . these proteins are associated with oxygen-independent oxidation reactions and are often found in anaerobic organisms; presumably they may also confer a metabolic advantage at low oxygen tensions, precisely the conditions that campylobacter faces in the gut lumen. this analysis identifies a central portion of both phages, carrying five radical sam genes, as being an interchangeable module with related functions that are likely to be non-essential for phage proliferation. however, it is possible that these metabolic enzymes could temporarily improve the competitive fitness of infected campylobacter thus also benefiting the phage.

repeat regions and genome expansion
cp <dig> and cpt <dig> both carry regions of repetitive dna, accounting for  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of their respective genomes. in all but one instance, common to both phages, the repeat regions are extragenic. the sole exception being a  <dig> bp repeat motif found within the putative coding sequences cpt_ <dig> and cpt10_ <dig> in cp <dig> and cpt <dig> respectively. the remaining repetitive regions contain between  <dig> and  <dig> copies of an approximately  <dig> bp core repeat unit , with minor sequence polymorphisms evident between units both within and between repeat regions. pcr was used to further examine these repeats in cp <dig>  six out of the seven regions examined were shown to produce amplicons of mixed lengths, despite the template originating from a single plaque purified population of cp <dig> . thus, the length of these regions would appear to be subject to variation during phage proliferation and may serve to create genome diversity. examination of individual repeat regions shows the presence of tandem repeats containing the same sequence polymorphisms, suggesting that expansion  could occur by slip-strand mispairing during dna replication. other repeat regions show evidence that recombination or translocation of repeat units has occurred, for example sequences more characteristic of repeat units within regions  <dig> and  <dig> are present in repeat region  <dig> of cp <dig>  so either identical sequence changes have occurred at multiple sites or more likely the repeat units have propagated themselves in the phage genome.

the generation of genomes of variable length could be an adaptive mechanism of the phages in response to conditions in their host or environment, perhaps by influencing the packaged genome and gene dosage in the terminally redundant regions. however, it is difficult to see to what extent these relatively small changes in genome size would contribute to such a mechanism. more likely, they may serve as recombination substrates allowing reassortment of phage genes. for example, there are three instances in cp <dig> , where one or more discrete cdss are bordered by repeat sequences. the relative positions of the repeat regions within the cp <dig> and cpt <dig> genomes are generally conserved . thus, they could also facilitate the exchange of larger segments between closely related phages. it is clear however that any cp <dig> and by corollary cpt <dig> recovered, is actually but a single representative of a larger family of related genomes under continual size-flux, the relative proportions of which may be dictated by selective environmental pressures.

tail proteins
both cp <dig> and cpt <dig> have multiple genes whose products show homology to gp <dig> - the tail sheath and gp <dig> - tail tube proteins. protein sequencing of tryptic fragments of proteins excised from sds-page demonstrates that at least two types of gp <dig> and two types of gp <dig> are present in mature cp <dig> virions . it is unknown whether the individual protein types are mixed within a single phage virion or if discrete populations exist, with each mature virion containing a single protein type. regardless, these variants arise within virus populations originally propagated from single plaques. the versions of gp <dig> are associated with mobile elements; this suggests a mechanism whereby copies of the tail sheath genes may be exchanged, thereby enabling reassortment between related phages and possibly modulating their host range.

phage replication and packaging
the phages carry genes involved in replication including; putative genes for dna primase, sliding clamp, sliding clamp loader proteins, dna polymerase, rnaseh and dna ligase, thus replication of the phages is most likely independent of the host replication complex. several putative transcription factors are present and may coordinate gene expression throughout the phages lifecycle; these genes provide inviting targets to examine transcriptional control during the infection process in these phages.

putative terminases with significant similarity to the t <dig> large terminase subunit gp <dig>  32% identity  for cp <dig>  have been identified in both phages. interestingly, the cp <dig> protein exhibits sequence conservation within the c-terminal domain, responsible for the dna nuclease activity, but not the n-terminus which has an atpase function and is responsible for dna binding  <cit> . cp <dig> also encodes a putative single-strand dna binding protein and t4-like endonuclease vii packaging and recombination enzyme, each of which have been shown to interact with gp <dig> during t <dig> genome packaging.

inter and intra-genomic gene flux
four new insertion sequence  elements, iscaje1- <dig>  were identified in the genomes of these two phages, all belonging to the is200/is <dig> family. in total five separate is elements were found in the two genomes, four of which were closely related to each other and belong to the subgroup that encode only tnpb. iscaje <dig> was found in both cp <dig> and cpt <dig>  but the two isoforms, which share 97% dna identity, have inserted into different locations in each genome. iscaje <dig> in cpt <dig> and iscaje <dig> in cp <dig> show similarity to each other, but are sufficiently different to constitute discrete is elements . although they were found to insert at the same target sequence , their relative genomic locations were different. the presence of related is elements in both phage genomes strongly suggests that these phages are derived from the same lineage. they predate upon the same range of hosts, thus allowing the transfer of related insertion elements to occur between phages or between host and phage genomes. the fourth novel is element, iscaje <dig>  represents a unique insertion in the cp <dig> genome, and encodes a putative tnpa subunit in addition to tnpb .

whether these insertion elements are active during infection is unknown, but they may provide mechanisms whereby regions of the phage genomes can be mobilised, perhaps allowing integration of dna sequences into the host chromosome or conversely the integration of novel genes into the phage genomes. the presence of putative homing endonucleases at similar sites in both genomes may also provide a partial exclusion mechanism during infection of multiple phage types, or provide a means by which transfer of those genes surrounding the endonuclease can occur, predominantly in favour of the homing endonuclease carrying phage  <cit> .

genetic transfer between host and virulent phage genomes can occur; illegitimate recombination allows the integration of host dna and if the integrated fragments carry genes that are useful or advantageous to the phage, or to hosts that the phage subsequently infect, they may be maintained in the genome. there is certainly evidence that genes from diverse sources have been integrated into both cp <dig> and cpt <dig>  fifteen cdss in cp <dig> show significant homology to campylobacter and its taxonomic relatives helicobacter, arcobacter and wolinella . the presence of such dna provides an indication of the importance of phage in the transfer and dissemination of genes between related species as, presumably, if these genes can mobilise onto the phage genome the reverse could also be true. although during the course of these experiments the gene contents have remained fixed.

the products of other cdss encoded by these phages showed the highest level of sequence identity with those from clostridium sp., bacillus sp., porphyromonas sp. and fusobacterium sp. thus, the host range of this phage may not have been limited to c. jejuni and c. coli but extended to other genera. consistent with this notion, these organisms do share common niches with various campylobacter sp. and therefore provide opportunities for encounters between phage and bacteria to occur.

rohwer has estimated that there are as many as  <dig> billion phage associated open reading frames still to be discovered and potentially  <dig> million different phage genotypes  <cit> . however, with the availability of an expanded portfolio of phage genome sequences it has become evident that while there are undoubtedly a large number of unique phage genomes, there are many other cases where phages can be clustered into closely related phylogenetic groups  <cit> . that these two phages have maintained their genomes in an almost identical configuration and at such a high level of sequence conservation, despite their independent isolation  <dig> years apart, suggests that they are well adapted to their hosts; we presume that this is campylobacter, and that just as host bacterial genomes are under selection by their environment there are also significant selective pressures to maintain optimal phage genome structure.

distribution of cp <dig> and cpt <dig> cdss in other virulent phage targeting campylobacter
to explore the possibility that these two bacteriophages were part of a conserved lineage targeting campylobacter, we compared a campylobacter phage  that we had partially sequenced years previously. cp <dig> had been isolated from chickens independently of both cp <dig> and cpt <dig> but unlike the latter had proved refractory to further molecular analysis  <cit> . nevertheless cp <dig> exhibits significant sequence identity with cp <dig>  ranging from 56% up to 100% over a total aggregate sequence length of  <dig> bp. we have also extended the current analysis by designing primers for specific regions within cp <dig> and cpt <dig> that feature insertion sequences, methylases and structural genes. these primer sets have been used in pcr experiments with genomic dna isolated from the remaining  <dig> phages of the uk campylobacter typing scheme.

five of the phages did not yield dna amplicons with any of the primer combinations tested , either due to gene absence, sequence divergence or dna modifications that prevent efficient pcr amplification  <cit> . however, the remaining  <dig> phages, of disparate origin, share sequence loci with cp <dig> and cpt <dig> . the typing phages have previously been classified on the basis of genome size by sails et al  <cit> . based on this classification cp <dig> and cpt <dig> fall within group ii, and it is clear from additional file  <dig> that the majority of the phages that contain amplicon homologues also belong to group ii. phages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> display particularly good correlation with the genes present in cp <dig> and cpt <dig>  however, ϕ <dig> isolated in the usa and belonging to group iii, also shares at least four genes with the cp220/cpt <dig> family and in this respect is similar to cp <dig>  which is also a group iii phage. therefore, some genes would seem to be more widely spread in the sampled campylobacter phage meta-genome than others.

the late transcription factor identified in both cp <dig> and cpt <dig> appears to be present in all of the group ii phages tested but only in one of the group iii phages. this may be indicative that these smaller phages are indeed different to the group ii class, and have different regulatory factors controlling gene expression. the resolution of these questions requires that we sequence more genomes from these phages.

CONCLUSIONS
we have compared two novel genome sequences from independently isolated virulent campylobacter phages and found them to be extremely similar to each other. examination of further campylobacter phages has revealed positive matches between a number of them and the two genomes sequenced in this paper, with the implication that the two sequenced phages are well adapted to their particular niche and that there are substantial selective pressures on these phages to maintain this particular genome configuration. it would suggest that phage genomes are as susceptible to selection for stability as they are for variability. genome stability could be aided by the ability of these phages to display genotypic and phenotypic microvariation by harboring variable length dna repeat sequences and expressing more than one form of structural protein. concerted sequencing efforts may reveal the fate of these individual phage lineages and elucidate the extent of genetic flux within campylobacter bacteriophages and between organisms sharing similar niches. however, for most organisms and certainly for campylobacter, the number of sequenced phages is insufficient to ascertain how genome stability would play a role in competition with other phage that may have adopted alternative evolutionary strategies.
