BACKGROUND
zoysia matrella  merrill , commonly known as manila grass, is naturally distributed in south-east asian countries, along the coasts of indian ocean, and in southern japan  and northern australia  <cit> . z. matrella was first introduced into the united states from manila in the early 20th century and since then it has been increasingly used as a turfgrass on athletic fields, golf courses, home lawns, and parks  <cit> . its fine leaf texture, high density, rhizomatous growth habit, and excellent tolerance to shade, heat, and salinity stresses has made it an ideal choice for high quality playing surfaces. z. matrella has become an economically important warm-season turfgrass, widely growing in the southern united states, japan, china, southeast asia, new guinea, australia and new zealand.

the primary focus of the zoysiagrass  breeding program is to improve resistance or tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses in order to reduce replacement and management costs incurred by the end user. the fall armyworm , spodoptera frugiperda , is a destructive pest in over  <dig> plant species, including the major cool-season and warm-season turfgrasses, corn, wheat, rice, sugarcane, and sorghum  <cit> . outbreaks of faw are sporadic and unpredictable, making it very difficult to control. utilization of host plant resistance is the most effective, efficient, and economical approach in pest control. in addition, the use of pest-resistant or tolerant varieties can help to reduce pesticide application and meet the increasing strict environmental quality and safety standards. for this reason, resistance to faw was evaluated in major zoysiagrass cultivars . among the twelve cultivars or genotypes evaluated, ‘cavalier’  exhibited the highest resistance to faw, regardless of the development stage of the larvae  <cit> . no faw larvae were observed to be able to survive more than 17 days on cavalier  <cit> . while, cultivar ‘diamond’  served as an excellent host and produced the largest larval weight in the test  <cit> . an f <dig> segregating population was created from a cross between the faw resistant cultivar cavalier and the sensitive cultivar diamond. in the present study, we developed high-resolution linkage maps of z. matrella and identified major quantitative trait loci  associated with faw resistance utilizing this segregating population.

effort has been made to map faw resistance in zoysiagrass by jessup et al.  <cit> . however, a limited number of molecular markers were used to develop the linkage map of z. matrella, which could lead to inaccurate genetic mapping of qtls. the locus of faw resistance was mapped on the linkage group   <dig> that only contains three markers  <cit> , which significantly limited its application in marker-assisted breeding and cloning the genes controlling the resistance to faw through a positional cloning approach.

the advent of next-generation sequencing  technologies provides us new opportunities to identify single nucleotide polymorphism  with high resolution in a cost-effective manner at a much faster speed than ever before. restriction site-associated dna sequencing , a method that utilizes ngs and restriction enzyme digestion to reduce the complexity across the targeted genomes enabling discovery of genome-wide genetic markers  <cit> , has become a powerful tool for a wide range of genetic studies in both model and non-model organisms. radseq has been applied in genetic map construction as well as detection of qtls that impact economically and agronomically important traits for a number of plant species, including eggplant  <cit> , barley  <cit> , ryegrass  <cit> , grape  <cit> , lotus  <cit> , pear  <cit> , and z. japonica  <cit> . in the present work, we developed high-resolution linkage maps of z. matrella using radseq markers to serve as foundation for gene mapping, qtl studies, assigning genome sequence to chromosomes, and comparative genomics studies.

the true grasses, family poaceae , provide for the major source of carbohydrates and proteins need by humans as well as various herbivores and fowl. panicoideae and chloridoideae are the two major subfamilies in the family poaceae, which include mostly c <dig> grasses that are adapted to warm climates. z. matrella is a member of the subfamily chloridoideae which has attracted less attention in genomics research due to its relatively smaller economic impact compared to its sister subfamily panicoideae. the sequence-tagged high-resolution linkage map of z. matrella provides a framework for comparative and evolutionary genomic studies thus allowing us to further investigate the evolutionary history of this underexplored grass family.

methods
plant materials and dna isolation
the f <dig> segregation population of  <dig> individuals created from a cross between z. matrella varieties cavalier  and diamond  was used for construction of the high-resolution linkage maps of z. matrella. the mapping population was planted in pots and maintained in a greenhouse at texas a&m agrilife research center at dallas, texas, usa.

young and healthy leaf tissue was harvested from each individual of the mapping population and frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately. the leaf tissue was then stored in a −80 °c freezer until dna isolation. approximately 100 mg of leaf tissue of each sample was ground into fine powder using liquid nitrogen, and then used for genomic dna isolation with dneasy plant mini kit . the extracted dna samples were run on an agarose gel and measured with a nanodrop 2000c  to ensure the dna quality for radseq library construction. the high-quality dna was then quantified by a qubit fluorometer with the qubit double-stranded dna hs assay kit .

radseq library construction and sequencing
the radseq libraries were constructed using a modified protocol described by wang et al.  <cit> . approximately 1 μg of genomic dna was digested with restriction enzymes nsii  and msei . the digested genomic dna was ligated with p <dig> and p <dig> adapters containing unique identifying sequences . the ligation reaction was then deactivated at 65 °c for 20 min and purified with axyprep mag pcr clean-up beads  following the manufacturer’s instruction. purified adaptor-ligated dna was pcr amplified with <dig> cycles using phusion high-fidelity dna polymerase . then, size selection of 300–500 bp dna fragments were performed using axyprep mag pcr clean-up beads  following the manufacturer’s instruction. quantification of recovered dna was performed on a qubit fluorometer . the radseq libraries of the whole mapping population were pooled and sequenced on an illumina hiseq  <dig> .

radseq sequence analysis and snp calling
raw data processing and snp identification were performed using modules implemented in the open-source stacks pipeline v <dig>   <cit> . raw reads were de-multiplexed and trimmed to remove low-quality sequences and adapter contamination using the ‘process_radtags’ module of the stacks package. sequences with base call accuracy lower than 99 %  in a sliding window of 15 % of the read-length were considered to be low quality and trimmed. filtered reads were then subjected to build stacks using ‘ustacks” module. a set of de novo loci were defined with no more than two nucleotide mismatches and at least six reads in each stack. a catalog of parental loci was created using ‘cstacks’ module. progeny loci were compared to the parental loci in catalog and snps were called using maximum likelihood method implemented in ‘sstacks’ module. finally, the haplotypes were determined and genotype data were exported as joinmap compatible format using the ‘genotypes’ module of stacks pipeline.

construction of genetic maps
linkage maps were constructed using joinmap  <dig>   <cit>  and outcross pollinated family  was selected as the population type. since both parents, diamond and cavalier, are tetraploids, we selected single-dose markers for linkage analysis to avoid statistical challenges caused by complicated segregation patterns for the reason as described by wu et al.  <cit> . markers that are heterozygous in diamond and homozygous cavalier  were selected to build diamond linkage groups. markers that are heterozygous in cavalier and homozygous in diamond  were selected to build cavalier linkage groups. qc-filtered snps were further filtered by the following standards: 1) markers must be genotyped in at least  <dig> out of  <dig> individuals; 2) individuals with over 10 % missing data were discarded; 3) markers segregating at distorted mendelian ratio  were discarded; 4) redundant markers were removed by standard of similarity =  <dig> 

the linkage groups were built using regression mapping algorithm, with a minimum logarithm of odds  value at  <dig>  and a maximum recombination frequency at  <dig> . marker positioning calculation was performed with a goodness-of-fit jump at  <dig>  followed by a “ripple” procedure . kosambi mapping function was used to correct linkage distance. ‘n.n. fit’ function of joinmap  <dig>  was used to check the map quality. mapchart  <dig>   <cit>  was used to draw linkage maps.

comparison with other grass genomes
we used blastn   <cit>  with default parameter settings and an e-value cutoff of  <dig> × 10− <dig> to blast the consensus sequences of mapped radseq markers against the genome sequences and gene models of rice and sorghum genomes. markers that showed significant hits to the genome sequences and/or gene models of rice and sorghum genomes were extracted and used for comparative genomics study.

in vitro insect feeding bioassays
the whole mapping population including the parents were subjected to in vitro insect feeding bioassays using the method described by reinert and engelke  <cit> . the bioassay was a no-choice experiment and conducted in the laboratory with 9-cm diam. x 20-mm deep plastic petri dishes as larvae feeding chambers. each dish was provided with 3 g of fresh leaf tissue on two layers of water-saturated filter paper. water was added daily as needed to maintain filter paper saturation and grass-clipping turgor. grass clippings were added daily as needed during the whole experiment to ensure turgid fresh grass was always available to the developing larvae. the faw used in the bioassay was a corn strain requested from the usda-ars-ibpmrl at tifton, ga. each individual of the mapping population was phenotyped using 4-day-old larvae that had first fed on fresh tissue of a susceptible zoysiagrass genotype, dalz  <dig>  dalz  <dig> is an excellent host of faw with near 100 % survival. three 4-day-old larvae were randomly selected and placed into the feeding chambers with clippings from the respective individuals making up the mapping population, in a randomized complete block design  replicated  <dig> times. each replicate started with  <dig> larvae for the first 3– <dig> days. and then the  <dig> larvae were separated into separate dishes. larvae survivorship was measured at 7-, 10-, and 17-day-old larvae. the fresh weight was measured at 12-day-old larvae. the number of days to pupation and to adult emergence, and the sex types of larvae were also recorded. the bioassay for the whole population was split into  <dig> experiments. the two parents and a susceptible zoysiagrass genotype, dalz  <dig>  were included in each experiment and used as controls to normalize the data between experiments. percentage of mortality was adjusted by abbott’s formula  <cit> .

qtl analysis
phenotypic data which includes mortality rate of the 7-, 10-, and 17-day-old faw larvae for each individual and the genetic map of cavalier were used for qtl analysis with mapqtl  <dig>  <cit> . the non-parametric kruskal–wallis  k-test was performed for detection of the presence and locations of qtls. qtl significance in the kruskall-wallis analysis was based on p value <  <dig>  significance level as suggested by the software.

RESULTS
rad sequencing and snp discovery
we genotyped all  <dig> individuals and parents that make up the whole mapping population using radseq. a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw sequence reads were obtained . after filtering low-quality sequence reads,  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads remained. all the radseq sequences can be accessed through the ncbi sra database under bioproject accession prjna <dig> . to maximize the chances of detecting segregating snps in the parents, we radseq’ed the parents more extensively than the offspring. we obtained  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads for the parent diamond and  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads for cavalier. the number of sequence reads of the f <dig> progeny ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  million reads. the average sequence depth for the f <dig> progeny was  <dig> , <dig> reads per progeny .

using ‘stacks’ software, we identified  <dig>  snp markers. to avoid statistical challenges caused by the complex segregation patterns of polyploid genomes, only single-dose alleles  were kept for linkage analysis. markers having a pattern of heterozygous in diamond and homozygous in cavalier were selected to build diamond linkage groups. markers that are heterozygous in cavalier and homozygous in diamond were selected to construct cavalier linkage groups. among the  <dig>  snps,  <dig>  of them were identified as sdas. a total of  <dig>  snps proved to be heterozygous in diamond and homozygous in cavalier, and a total of  <dig>  snps were found to be heterozygous in cavalier and homozygous in diamond. we further filtered f <dig> individuals that contained a large number of missing data and snp markers that showed non-mendelian and skewed segregation patterns . among the 95 f <dig> individuals,  <dig> individuals showed more than 10 % missing data or markers with extreme distorted segregation patterns. the remaining  <dig> individuals were used for linkage map construction. among the  <dig>  diamond markers,  <dig>  markers remained after filtering identical markers and removing markers with more than 10 % missing data and significantly distorted markers. among the  <dig>  cavalier snp markers,  <dig>  markers remained after filtering identical markers and removing markers with more than 10 % missing data and significantly distorted markers. the detailed filtering process is shown in table  <dig>  the final dataset of  <dig>  and  <dig>  snp markers were used to construct genetic maps for diamond and cavalier, respectively.table  <dig> summary of snp marker filtering procedure



linkage map construction
a pseudo-testcross strategy was used to develop the genetic maps of z. matrella. because only single-dose markers were selected for genetic map construction, the segregation ratio of the selected markers should be 1: <dig> in the f <dig> progeny. the selected markers were then divided into two data sets based on their segregation patterns. each data set contains the meiotic segregation information of one parent. then the two segregation data sets were subjected to construction of two independent linkage maps of z. matrella, one for each parent.

using joinmap  <dig>  <cit> , the selected markers were grouped into distinct lgs. among the  <dig>  single-dose snp markers selected for linkage analysis in diamond,  <dig>   of them were grouped into  <dig> major lgs with a lod score ≥ <dig>   <dig> marker remained as singleton, and  <dig> markers were assigned to  <dig> small lgs with  <dig> and  <dig> markers for each lg, respectively. among the  <dig>  snps selected for linkage analysis in cavalier,  <dig>   of them were grouped into  <dig> major lgs with a lod score ≥ <dig>   <dig> markers remained unlinked, and  <dig> markers were assigned to  <dig> small lgs with  <dig> and  <dig> markers for each lg, respectively.

the markers in each lg were positioned and ordered using regression mapping algorithm . markers of “suspect linkages” were inspected for accuracy in scoring and removed from the map calculation if they proved problematic or troublesome. a total of  <dig> markers from diamond lgs and  <dig> markers from cavalier lgs were identified as “suspect linkages” during mapping and thus were discarded from subsequent linkage analysis.

compared to the cavalier linkage map, diamond lgs contained fewer numbers of markers. we attempted to place the distorted markers back to increase the marker-density of the diamond linkage map. the distorted markers were kept on the final linkage map only when their presence did not change the orders of surrounding markers. a total of  <dig> distorted markers, accounting for  <dig>  % of the total mapped markers, were placed back on the diamond linkage map. the distorted markers were not evenly distributed across lgs. the majority of the distorted markers were clustered together and formed segregation distortion regions . five sdrs were detected on lgs <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and three of these sdrs were located near the ends of the lgs . four distorted markers on lg <dig> were clustered at one end of the lg, extending the length of lg <dig> from  <dig>  cm to 72 cm. thirty-eight distorted markers formed the largest cluster in the middle section of lg <dig> , increasing the length of lg <dig> from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm. the final lg <dig> contained  <dig> distorted markers at one end of the lg, extending the length of lg <dig> from 71 cm to  <dig>  cm. lg <dig>  contained  <dig> distorted markers between  <dig>  cm and 95 cm without changing the length of the lg. lg <dig> contained  <dig> distorted markers at one end of the lg, extending the length of lg <dig> from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm.fig.  <dig> the distribution of radseq markers on the high-resolution linkage maps of zoysia matrella. a genetic map of diamond. the number on the top of each linkage group  shows lg number and the ruler on the left of each genetic map indicates the length of the lg in centimorgans . the black lines on the right of diamond lgs indicates segregation distortion regions . b genetic map of cavalier



we numbered each lg based on their homology with sorghum chromosomes . for each sorghum chromosome, we identified two homologous lgs, eg. both lg <dig> and lg <dig> are homologs of sorghum chromsome <dig>  and lg <dig> and lg <dig> are homologs of sb <dig>  etc. . the total lengths of the final genetic maps for diamond and cavalier were  <dig> .48 cm and  <dig> .92 cm, respectively. considering that diamond and cavalier share almost the same genome size, the average recombination ratio between the two was estimated at 1:  <dig>  and no significant difference for overall recombination rates was observed between the two genomes. the mapped markers are distributed unevenly along each lg. in general, the middle sections of lgs contained the highest density of markers, while, both ends of each lg had the lowest density of markers. the ‘gap <5 cm’ value, which reflects linkage degree between adjacent markers, was  <dig> and 99 % for diamond and cavalier genetic maps, respectively.table  <dig> summary statistics for diamond and cavalier linkage maps


lg linkage group, density: average distance between adjacent markers; gaps <5 cm: percentage of locus intervals where the distance between adjacent loci was smaller than 5 cm



the genetic map of diamond consisted of  <dig>  snp markers distributed on  <dig> lgs, with an average interval of  <dig>  cm . in the diamond genetic map, the length of individual lg ranged from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm , and the number of markers mapped on each lg ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . lg <dig> showed the highest density of markers at  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers, almost twice of the density at genome level. while, lg <dig> had the lowest density of markers at  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers, 150 % reduction of the marker density compared with genome-wide average. no major interruption was observed on most lgs except three relatively large gaps , a  <dig>  cm gap on lg <dig>  a  <dig>  cm gap on lg <dig>  and a  <dig>  cm gap on lg <dig>  the detailed information of diamond genetic map are given in additional file 3: figure s <dig> and additional file 4: table s <dig> 

the final genetic map of cavalier consisted of  <dig>  snp markers mapped on  <dig> major lgs. compared with the diamond linkage map, the cavalier map had a much higher density with an average interval of  <dig>  cm . the number of markers mapped on each lg varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the average interval of individual lg ranged from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm , and the length of individual lg varied from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm . the longest lg was lg <dig>  which contains  <dig> loci spanning  <dig>  cm. the shortest was lg <dig>  which contains  <dig> loci spanning  <dig>  cm. owing to the high density, only  <dig> gap >10 cm, a  <dig>  cm gap on lg <dig>  was found in cavalier linkage map. the detailed information of cavalier genetic map are given in additional file 5: figure s <dig> and additional file 6: table s <dig> 

conserved synteny relationships between z. matrella and other grass genomes
genetically mapped high-density rad tags provide anchor points for comparative genomics analysis between z. matrella and other grass species. one of the most important research topics in comparative and evolutionary genomics studies is karyotype evolution. rice represents the most extensively studied and complete annotated genome among grasses. and it was suggested that the two major clades of grasses, panicoideae-aristidoideae-centhothecoideae-chloridoideae- micrairoideae-arundinoideae-danthoideae  and bambusoideae-ehrhartoidea-pooideae , evolved from a common paleo-ancestor genome having a base chromosome number of n =  <dig> . comparative genomic analysis revealed the rice genome resembled the most of the ancestral form of the paleo-ancestor genome . to address the question how z. matrella genome obtained its reduced chromosome count from  <dig> to  <dig>  we conducted comparative genomics analysis between z. matrella and rice and identified the synteny relationships between these two genomes.

we investigated synteny relationships between z. matrella and rice genomes. consensus sequences of the mapped radseq markers were blasted against the genome sequences and gene models of the rice genome. markers showing significant hits were then extracted for comparison study. among the  <dig>  rad tags positioned on diamond lgs,  <dig>  were found to have significant sequence similarities to gene models or genome sequences on the rice chromosomes . among the  <dig>  rad tags mapped on cavalier lgs,  <dig>  can be associated with gene models or genome sequences on the rice chromosomes . in order to have a whole genome comparison view of the two species, we generated a circos plot  and a dot plot  by plotting the linkage map positions of z. matrella rad markers against the physical positions of aligned sequences in the rice genome. the dot plot and the circos plot illustrated considerable collinearity between the two genomes. for each rice chromosome, we identified two corresponding lgs or regions in z. matrella genome, consistent with an expected 1: <dig> ratio between the diploid rice and tetraploid z. matrella genomes . the high levels of conservation of gene content and orders along the entire chromosome were observed between eight rice chromosomes and their orthologous chromosomes in z. matrella . the remaining four rice chromosomes, os <dig>  os <dig>  os <dig>  and os <dig>  were involved in chromosome fusion events reducing the base chromosome number of n =  <dig> in the paleo-ancestor genome to n =  <dig> in z. matrella genome . z. matrella lg <dig> and its homologous lg <dig> correspond to two rice chromosomes, os <dig> and os <dig>  the two arms of lg <dig> and  <dig> are orthologous to os <dig>  while the middle sections of lg <dig> and lg <dig> correspond to a truncated os <dig> . we couldn’t identify the orthologous regions to the distal ends of os <dig> in z. matrella genome, suggesting the terminal parts of os <dig> might have been lost during evolution. similarly, z. matrella lg <dig> and its homologous lg <dig> correspond to two rice chromosomes, os <dig> and os <dig>  the two arms of lg <dig> and  <dig> are orthologous to os <dig>  while the middle sections of lg <dig> and lg <dig> correspond to os <dig>  our comparative analysis indicated the paleo-ancestor genome with the base chromosome number of n =  <dig> had undergone two nested chromosomal fusion  events to reduce the base chromosome number from  <dig> to  <dig> in z. matrella genome. since rice genome has largely preserved the paleo-ancestral karyotype, we numbered the paleo-ancestral chromosomes  based on rice karyotype. therefore, two paleo-ancestral chromosomes ρ <dig> and ρ <dig> were invaded by paleo-ancestral chromosomes ρ <dig> and ρ <dig> in the centromeric regions, respectively, in the two ncf events reducing the base chromosome number from  <dig> to  <dig> in z. matrella genome.fig.  <dig> genome comparison between zoysia matrella and rice. circos plot revealed the rice chromosome os  <dig> inserted into the centromere region of os  <dig> to form cavalier lgs  <dig> and  <dig>  and the rice chromosome os  <dig> inserted into the centromere region of os  <dig> to form cavalier lgs  <dig> and 20

z. matrella and sorghum are closely related plant species and belong to sister subfamilies, chloridoideae and panicoideae, respectively, under paccmad clade. like z. matrella, sorghum has a base chromosome number of n =  <dig>  did the same pairs of ancestral chromosomes fuse in the karyotype evolution of the sorghum genome as fused in the z. matrella lineage? to address this question, we conducted comparative genomics analysis between z. matrella and sorghum genomes.

we identified anchor points for comparative analysis by searching the consensus sequences of the mapped rad tags on z. matrella genetic maps against sorghum genome sequences and gene models. among the  <dig>  rad tags mapped on the cavalier lgs,  <dig>  of them can be placed on sorghum chromosomes . among the  <dig>  rad markers positioned on the diamond lgs,  <dig>  of them can be found homologous positions on sorghum chromosomes . dot-plot diagrams were drawn by plotting the genetic positions of anchored markers on z. matrella maps against the physical positions of their homologs on sorghum chromosomes . the dot-plot diagrams revealed extensive collinearity along chromosome arms between genomes of z. matrella and s. bicolor, but interruption of collinearity occurred at centromeric and pericentromeric regions of sorghum chromosomes for each pair of orthologous chromosomes. for each sorghum chromosome, we identified two orthologous lgs in z. matrella, reinforcing the tetraploid genome nature of z. matrella. we numbered the z. matrella lgs according to their homology to sorghum chromosomes to simplify the synteny relationship for comparative genomics studies.

comparative genomics analysis has revealed that sorghum chromosomes sb <dig> and sb <dig> derived from the paleo-ancestral chromosomes ρ <dig> and ρ <dig>  and ρ <dig> and ρ <dig>  respectively, via ncfs  <cit> . these two ncf events, ρ3- ρ10- ρ <dig> and ρ7- ρ9- ρ <dig>  occurred in sorghum lineage are different with the two ncf events we observed in the z. matrella lineage, ρ2- ρ10- ρ <dig> and ρ6- ρ9- ρ <dig>  our comparative analysis between z. matrella and sorghum revealed genome rearrangements occurred between sb <dig> and sb <dig> , and between sb <dig> and sb <dig>  , reinforcing our observations that the two ncf events occurred independently in z. matrella and sorghum lineages during the karyotype evolution. interestingly, the paleo-ancestral chromosomes ρ <dig> and ρ <dig> served as invading chromosomes in the ncf events in both z. matrella and sorghum lineages. table  <dig> summarizes detailed synteny relationships between z. matrella lgs and sorghum and rice chromosomes.table  <dig> syntenic relationships between zoysia matrella lgs and rice and sorghum chromosomes. numbers of markers that can be positioned on rice and sorghum chromosomes were present and the number of markers that hit rice or sorghum gene models were present in the bracket



besides inter-chromosome rearrangements, dot-plot also revealed few intra-chromosomal rearrangements between z. matrella and sorghum genomes. one inversion event was observed near one ends of lg <dig> and lg <dig> when the comparison was done between z. matrella and sorghum genomes, but not between z. matrella and rice genomes. this inversion event was also revealed by the comparison between sorghum and rice genomes. similarly, another two inversion events were identified between z. matrella lg <dig> and lg <dig> and their corresponding sorghum chromosome sb <dig>  and between z. matrella lg <dig> and lg <dig> and their corresponding sorghum chromosome sb <dig>  these two inversion events were also observed when we compared sorghum chromosomes and their orthologous chromosomes in rice genome, but not between z. matrella lgs and their rice homologous chromosomes.

identification of qtls associated with resistance to faw
we evaluated the faw resistance in the whole mapping population of  <dig> individuals using in vitro insect feeding bioassays. the bioassay for the whole population was split into  <dig> experiments and the two parents and a susceptible zoysiagrass genotype, dalz  <dig>  were included in each experiment. the data between experiments were normalized using the susceptible genotype, dalz  <dig>  by abbott’s formula  <cit> . the mortality rates of larvae that were fed with leaf tissue of each individual of the mapping population were recorded at 7-, 10-, and 17-day. significant difference in resistance to faw between the two parents was observed during the whole procedure of in vitro insect feeding bioassay. overall, the frequency distribution of the mortality rate of larvae fed leaf tissue from each individual of the mapping population exhibited non-normal distribution . after 7 days of feeding, the mortality of larvae that were fed leaf tissue from the faw resistant parent cavalier was  <dig>  % versus  <dig>  % for the sensitive parent diamond. the f <dig> population showed a skewed distribution toward faw sensitive . a total of 88 f <dig>  exhibited similar level of lethality rate  as the faw sensitive parent diamond at 7-day. while, a total of 33 f <dig> individuals  showed higher lethality rates than the faw resistant parent cavalier, indicating transgressive segregation of the mapping population for faw resistance. after 10 days of feeding, the mortality of larvae that were fed leaf tissue from the faw resistant parent cavalier was at  <dig>  %, a significant increase over the data collected at 7-day. for the faw sensitive parent diamond, the mortality of larvae remained low at  <dig>  %. among the 221 f <dig> individuals, almost equal number of individuals exhibited extreme tolerance and extreme sensitive to faw . after 17 days of feeding, the mortality rate of larvae that were fed leaf tissue from cavalier had increased to 100 %, while these that fed on diamond tissue remained at similar levels as the one collected at 10-day . the frequency distribution of the mortality rate of larvae fed leaf tissue from the f <dig> individuals shifted toward faw resistance at 17-day .

we took non-parametric genomic scan based on kruskal-wallis  test to identify loci statistically  associated with faw resistance. the data sets of mortality rates of larvae collected at 7-, 10-, and 17-day were subjected to single marker association analysis individually. using the data set collected at 7-day, two loci,  <dig>  cm on lg <dig> and  <dig>  cm on lg <dig>  were detected to be significantly associated with faw resistance  . using the data set collected at 10-day, we identified three additional loci,  <dig>  cm and 50 cm on lg <dig> and  <dig>  cm on lg <dig>  besides the two loci detected by the 7-day data set . the 17-day data set detected three loci on lg <dig> with a significance level at p <  <dig>  . the locus at  <dig>  cm on lg <dig> was consistently detected by all three data set, indicating this locus play important roles in resistance to faw at a wide range of insect growth and developmental stages. the locus at  <dig>  cm on lg <dig> was detected by both 7-day and 10-day data sets, but not detected by 17-day data set, suggesting this locus might provide resistance to faw at the relatively early insect growth and developmental stages. similarly, two loci on lg <dig> at 50 cm and  <dig>  cm were detected by 10-day and 17-day data sets, not by 7-day data set, suggesting this locus might provide resistance to faw at the relatively late insect growth and developmental stages. three loci on lg <dig> ranging within  <dig>  cm  were detected to be significantly associated with faw resistance, providing us a major target for cloning genes controlling faw resistance. to saturate the major qtl region on lg <dig>  we mapped the distorted markers back on lg <dig> and the order of markers remained same after adding distorted markers . the major qtl region,  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm on lg <dig>  was aligned on rice genome . a syntenic block on rice chromosome os <dig>  was identified corresponding to the major qtl region.table  <dig> list of qtls detected to be significantly associated with faw resistance in zoysiagrass cavalier

grasses are the most important plant family to humans. they not only provide more than ¾ of our food, but also serve as a major producer of our oxygen due to their ecological dominance, wide geographic range, and enormous biomass. the chloridoideae, consisting of more than  <dig>  species, is one of the three largest subfamilies of the grasses, along with pooideae and panicoideae  <cit> . chloridoideae species share unusual features of leaf anatomy, and many of them exhibit extreme levels of tolerance to drought and high soil salinity. furthermore, the transition from c <dig> to c <dig> photosynthesis that confers ecological success in many biomes firstly occurred in subfamily chloridoideae, approximately  <dig> – <dig>  mya  <cit> . and the subfamily chloridoideae has been identified as the largest wholly c <dig> clade in plants  <cit> . despite their ecological and economic importance, chloridoideae species have received little attention on genomics studies, resulting in limited genetic and genomic information available for this important plant family. as a chloridoideae species, z. matrella has a base chromosome number of n =  <dig> which represents the predominant karyotypic number among the chloridoideae. the sequence-tagged high-density linkage maps of z. matrella developed in the present study provide a high-resolution framework for understanding evolutionary processes of this underexplored plant family, and serve as a foundation for future comparative genomic studies to expand our understanding of the origin of c <dig> photosynthesis in grasses.

karyotype evolution in the subfamily chloridoideae
karyotype evolution and genome size variation have been of significant interest, not only in terms of evolutionary relationships, but also in determining the evolutionary events that have shaped grass genomes. the two distinct evolutionary lineages in the grass family poaceae, the bep and paccmad clades, diverged from one another approximately 65– <dig> mya  <cit> . comparative genomic analysis revealed that grasses evolved from an n =  <dig> ancestral karyotype, which subsequently underwent whole genome duplication  and chromosome fusion  to become n =  <dig>  <cit> . compared with other existing grass species, the modern rice  genome has retained the karyotype structure of the n =  <dig> ancestral genome the most  <cit> . the n =  <dig> intermediate ancestral genome subsequently went through two ncfs, giving the progenitor genome of the panicoideae ancestor with n =  <dig>  <cit> . to elucidate the karyotype evolution from the n =  <dig> intermediate ancestral genome toward the karyotype of chloridoideae, we compared the genome structure of z. matrella to rice and sorghum. our z. matrella-rice-sorghum comparison studies revealed that the z. matrella genome evolved from the n =  <dig> intermediate ancestral genome through two ncf events, ρ2-ρ10-ρ <dig> and ρ6-ρ9-ρ <dig>  which are different from the two ncf events  occurred in sorghum genome. both panicoideae and chloridoideae ancestors were derived from the paleo-ancestor of n =  <dig> though two ncf events. however, different sets of paleo-ancestral chromosomes were involved in the ncf events, indicating different karyotype evolutionary paths led to the separation of the two sister subfamilies, panicoideae and chloridoideae. in the process of karyotype evolution in chloridoideae, the paleo-ancestral chromosomes ρ <dig> and ρ <dig> served as ‘invading’ chromosomes and ρ <dig> and ρ <dig> served as ‘invaded’ chromosomes. while, two different chromosomes, ρ <dig> and ρ <dig>  played as ‘invaded’ chromosomes in the process of karyotype evolution in panicoideae although ρ <dig> and ρ <dig> still played as ‘invading’ chromosomes. paleo-ancestral chromosomes ρ <dig> and ρ <dig> served as ‘invading’ chromosomes twice in the two distinct karyotype evolutionary pathways, indicating that their unique and common structure is favored in the ncf process. interestingly, the two ‘invaded’ chromosomes, ρ <dig> and ρ <dig> in chloridoideae, and ρ <dig> and ρ <dig> in panicoideae, were paired homologous chromosomes, suggesting the ncf process might be facilitated by the specific structure of the complex formed between the paired homologous chromosomes. if our hypothesis is true, the two ncfs in both panicoideae and chloridoideae should be completed in a single step instead of two steps. in fact, there is no basic chromosome number of n =  <dig> observed in either panicoideae or chloridoideae  <cit> , strongly supporting our hypothesis. in addition, the karyotype evolution analysis in this study is strongly supported by an earlier study using an independent population of z. japonica  <cit> . based on our results, we summarized the karyotype evolution of panicoideae and chloridoideae subfamilies from the n =  <dig> intermediate ancestral genome in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> the karyotype evolution of panicoideae and chloridoideae subfamilies from the n =  <dig> intermediate ancestral genome



genome collinearity between zoysiagrass and rice, and between zoysiagrass and sorghum
modern grass genomes have diverged at the level of genome size tremendously since they evolved from a common ancestor. the common ancestor genome had undergone a genome-wide duplication approximately  <dig> mya . diversification of the two main grass clades, bep and paccmad, occurred approximately  <dig> mya following the genome-wide duplication . both zoysiagrass and sorghum are under the paccmad clade and rice belongs to the bep clade. although zoysiagrass is evolutionarily closer to sorghum than rice, our comparative analysis revealed a higher level of conservation between zoysiagrass and rice than that between zoysiagrass and sorghum. the genome size of the ancestral genome at the base of poales was reconstructed as 1c =  <dig>  pg  <cit> , and the genome size of rice was estimated at 1c =  <dig> – <dig>  pg  <cit> , indicating extensive dna loss during the diploidization following the genome-wide duplication. the genome sizes of zoysiagrass and sorghum were estimated by flow cytometry at  <dig>  pg/2c  <cit>  and  <dig> – <dig>  pg/2c  <cit> , respectively. zoysiagrass is a tetraploid genome, and both rice and sorghum are diploid genomes. therefore, the monoploid genome size of zoysiagrass would be the smallest among the three genomes, approximately  <dig>  pg, only half of the size of the monoploid genome of rice and a quarter of the monoploid genome of sorghum. in general, chloridoideae species have relatively smaller genome sizes and a narrower range of chromosome sizes compared to panicoideae species  <cit> , which may suggest the two subfamilies followed two distinctive paths toward genome size evolution after they diverged from a common ancestor. genome size differences in plants are mainly caused by amplification and removal of repetitive dnas  <cit> . therefore, we predicted that zoysiagrass genome contained much less repetitive sequences than sorghum genome. mutations and genetic rearrangements are frequently associated with repetitive sequences. large chromosomal rearrangements can be caused by ectopic recombination between repeat sequences in different genomic regions  <cit> . thus, the sorghum genome might have undergone more frequent genome rearrangements than did zoysiagrass due to its higher amount of repetitive sequences. on the other hand, the ancestor genome structure might have been better preserved in zoysiagrass than in sorghum.

faw resistance in zoysiagrass influenced by a major gene effect
high-resolution genetic map provides an essential tool for efficient detection of qtls of economically and agronomically important traits. the accuracy of qtl mapping relies to some extent on the density of the genetic maps. in our present study, the genetic maps consisted of  <dig>  and  <dig>  snp markers with average interval of  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively. considering the genome size of zoysiagrass estimated at  <dig> mbp  <cit> , the average physical distance between adjacent markers is 177 kb for the diamond map and 118 kb for the cavalier map. the total lengths of the genetic maps are  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm for diamond and cavalier, respectively. thus, the global ratio of physical distance /genetic distance  is 241 kb/cm for the diamond map and 231 kb/cm for the cavalier map. the major qtl for faw resistance was mapped on the  <dig>  cm region  of the lg <dig> of cavalier map. based on this estimation, the major target of faw resistance encompasses approximately 320 kb.

plant resistance to herbivores can be attributed to plant secondary metabolites and plant physical traits. studies have shown that leaf tensile strength and lignin concentration were positively correlated with faw resistance in varieties such as cavalier and emerald  <cit> . in addition, the secondary metabolite luteolin- <dig> was found in zoysiagrass that has an inverse relationship with faw mortality, while luteolin- <dig> was positively correlated with faw mortality in zoysiagrass  <cit> . we evaluated the faw resistance in the whole mapping population of  <dig> individuals using in vitro no choice insect feeding bioassays. our phenotype evaluation revealed a clearly non-normal distribution, implying the possibility that faw resistance in zoysiagrass was influenced by specific genes with major effects. after 10 days of feeding, the ratio of extremely tolerant f1s to extremely sensitive f1s fitted 1: <dig> ratio, reinforcing our hypothesis that the faw resistance in zoysiagrass is a quantitative trait with a major gene effect.

our qtl analysis provides us a major target for cloning faw resistance gene in zoysiagrass, which will serve as a basis for a better understanding of host resistance adaptations in zoysiagrass. the major qtls associated with faw resistance will be validated using different mapping populations and a large germplasm collection, which will help refine estimates of the genetic structure of faw resistance in zoysiagrass. molecular markers developed from the present study offer breeders a more efficient approach to select for targeted chromosome regions during zoysiagrass improvement efforts.

CONCLUSIONS
we constructed sequence-based high-resolution genetic maps of z. matrella. these maps offer valuable resource for comparative genomic analysis between z. matrella and other plant species. our comparative analysis revealed that z. matrella shared a higher level of genome collinearity with rice than that with sorghum. our result suggested that the sister subfamilies chloridoideae and panicoideae followed separate karyotype evolutionary pathways reducing the chromosome number from  <dig> to  <dig>  these high-resolution maps also provide us important tools for detection of qtls associated with economically and agronomically important traits. six loci located on lgs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were detected to be significantly associated with faw resistance, providing us a major target for cloning faw resistance gene in zoysiagrass.
