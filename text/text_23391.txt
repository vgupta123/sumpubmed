BACKGROUND
molecules that orchestrate the cell cycle have to interact with extrinsic signals to trigger neural cell specification and differentiation  <cit> . discovered  <dig> years ago, necdin , possesses all the characteristics of such a molecule as described in the literature  <cit> . necdin belongs to the type ii mage  gene family, all of whose members share a mage homology domain  of an as yet unknown function  <cit> .

different roles, mainly based on in vitro studies, have been assigned to necdin. the mouse necdin protein was first defined as a "growth-suppressor" that could facilitate the cell cycle exit and the maintenance of the neuronal postmitotic state  <cit> . a role in neuronal terminal differentiation, more specifically in neurite outgrowth and fasciculation was also supported by a number of studies  <cit> . this role is thought to implicate the nerve growth factor  signalling pathway  <cit>  and/or a signalling pathway involving centrosomal function and cytoskeletal rearrangement  <cit> . supporting these findings, a large variety of necdin partners have been revealed using yeast two-hybrids or ras rescue systems. necdin cytoplasmic interactors , or nuclear interactors such as cell-cycle proteins  and neurotrophic receptors  have been characterized.

interestingly, it is not only necdin but also other members of the family such as nrage and mageh <dig> which interact with the death domain of the low affinity receptor to neurotrophin p75ntr  <cit> .

as most of these data were obtained from in vitro experiments, their physiological relevance remained to be demonstrated. thus, by focusing on the nervous system, we asked whether necdin plays a unique role via a single signalling pathway or different roles, as suggested by the in vitro experiments, depending on the cell type and on the physiological context. effectively, the necdin expression profile in mouse is consistent with a role in neuronal differentiation including cell cycle arrest, neuronal maturation and later in maintaining a post-mitotic state  <cit> .

the human necdin gene is deleted in the prader-willi syndrome   <cit> , a complex multigenic neurogenetic disease. pws is mainly characterized by a transient infantile hypotonia, global development delay, hyperphagia leading to severe obesity and many other clinical features   <cit> .

four different necdin-null mouse models  <cit>  have been generated in order to reveal the physiological and pathophysiological role of necdin. at first glance, these mice show no obvious abnormal phenotype. nevertheless, some phenotypic characteristics reveal striking parallels with the phenotypic manifestations in pws patients: such as a high level of scraping, a particular cognitive profile  <cit>  and, more importantly, depending on the genetic background, postnatal respiratory distress leading to lethality  <cit> . up to now, the phenotype description of the necdin knock-out  model is still partial and further analysis could reveal other alterations similar to pw symptoms.

finally, subtle morphological abnormalities were also reported suggesting that necdin deficiency results in aberrant neuronal migration and affects axonal extension, arborization and fasciculation during development  <cit> .

here, in order to clarify the functional roles of necdin in the cellular physiology of the nervous system, we investigate the sensory system. first, we explore the sensory-motor behaviour and reveal sensory deficits that might result from necdin deficiency. then, to address the function of necdin at the cellular level we examine the integrity of dorsal root ganglias  in necdin mutant embryos  we have previously generated  <cit> . we analyse carefully the spatio-temporal expression pattern of necdin in the developing sensory neurons. we observe a significative loss of trka and trkc sensory neurons in ndn ko compared to wild type; this loss is achieved at e <dig>  dpc and remains at p <dig>  we reveal an increase of caspase3-dependant apoptosis, before the peak of naturally occurring cell death. this cell death does not involve the p75ntr receptor.

we also investigate the axonal outgrowth in several structures innervated by the spinal sensory neurons in necdin mutants.

RESULTS
phenotypic features suggest defects of sensory pathways
phenotypical analysis is performed on  <dig> wild type and  <dig> mutant adult mice  . ndn ko mice had normal body weight and body temperature , well-groomed coats, and normal body posture. gross neurological examination of animals reveals no distinct signs of modified sensory or vestibular reflexes in mutants as assessed in simple tests of vision, audition, olfaction, touch sensitivity or righting reflex. necdin mutants also show a normal reactivity to handling and a normal exploratory activity when exposed to a novel cage immediately following the transfer arousal test.

we explored further the sensory-motor abilities and general behaviour of necdin adult deficient mice using specific behavioural tests. mutant mice had comparable level of spontaneous activity to wild types, as revealed by the distance travelled and number of rears in the open field test . the number of entries and percentage of time spent in the center of the open field arena was also comparable between genotypes, suggesting that necdin deletion has no effect on anxiety at least in this test. when analyzed for specific motor abilities, mutant mice performed as well as the wild type mice in the grip and string tests, showing that muscle strength and traction force are not affected in mutants . on the other hand, the time spent in an accelerated rotarod was reduced and the latency to reach the goal platform in the beam walking test was significantly increased  in necdin deficient mice as compared to wild type, suggesting motor coordination or balance deficits in mutants. mutant mice also showed a higher tendency to slip off with the hind limbs that might be interpreted as altered proprioceptive sensitivity.

values indicated represent the median and, between brackets, the interquartile range.

electrophysiological tests to evaluate innervation of peripheral targets and spinal cord reflexes, were performed on hindlimbs . the sensory nerve conduction velocity  is comparable between wild type and necdin deficient mice. the compound muscle action potentials including the direct muscle response  at the level of the gastrocnemius or plantar muscles, and the monosynaptic reflex response  on the plantar muscle were also recorded. amplitude and latency of the m-wave were not significantly different between mutant and wild type mice. on the other hand, the h-wave amplitude and the h/m amplitude ratio, recorded on the plantar muscle, were significantly higher in the mutant group . the h-reflex amplitude and the h/m amplitude ratio have been used traditionally to evaluate spinal excitability. these data suggest an overall facilitation of the stretch reflex circuit  that could result from hyperexcitability of motoneurons and/or sensory neurons.

finally, the hot plate test was used to evaluate pain sensitivity and revealed significantly reduced withdrawal latency in mutant mice compared to wild type animals , thus suggesting reduced pain threshold in necdin deficient mice.

taken together these data reveal significant defects in the sensory system.

expression of necdin in developing drgs
in order to detect histological abnormalities in lumbar drgs that could be correlated to the sensory dysfunction in ndn ko mice, we first analysed the morphology and the size of lumbar drgs. at p <dig>  comparing the volume of the first lumbar  drg between ndn ko and wild type mice , we observed a 37% reduction of the mutant l <dig> drg volume , n = 3; ndn ko:  <dig>   <dig> Î¼m <dig> , n = 3). since previously, we have shown that necdin is expressed through embryogenesis in postmitotic neurons  <cit> , we hypothesized that a defect during the ontogeny of sensory neurons in necdin deficient mice might result in a loss or pronounced atrophy of sensory neurons resulting in a reduction of l <dig> drgs volume in necdin deficient mice. in developing drgs, expression of necdin transcript is first detected at e <dig>  and progressively increases to e <dig> , in accordance with an increasing number of neurons present in ganglia . at e <dig> , using the thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine , to label proliferative cells, we revealed the absence of necdin expression in brdu-positive cells ; however we showed a colabelling of necdin and neurofilament  by immunohistochemistry  . therefore, in developing drgs, necdin is clearly expressed in post-mitotic neurons and not in the progenitor cells as it has been shown in other brain structures  <cit> . necdin protein is detected in the nucleus and the cytoplasm , as confirmed by confocal analysis .

in an attempt to determine which class of specified drg neurons express necdin, we examined the expression of the three tyrosine kinase receptors , trka, trkb and trkc; characterizing respectively ngf responding nociceptive neurons, bdnf responsive neurons and nt <dig> responsive proprioceptive neurons  <cit> . at e <dig> , in situ hybridization using the riboprobes trka , trkb  and trkc  combined with immunostaining using necdin antibodies showed that all trkc- and trkb-expressing neurons, as well as a significantly high number  of trka-expressing neurons, co-expressed necdin.

lack of necdin causes embryonic loss of sensory neurons
with regard to necdin expression, we examined more closely the trka, trkb and trkc sensory neuron subpopulations. as these populations are highly dynamic through gangliogenesis  <cit> , we studied different embryonic stages from e <dig> , when discernible drgs are formed, to e <dig> , when drg neurons are specified. at all stages, trka, trkb and trkc expressing cells were detected in mutant mice as shown at e <dig>  . at e <dig>  a quantitative analysis of each trk-expressing cell subpopulation in lumbar drgs , revealed no difference between wild type and mutant embryos . at e <dig> , the morphological appearance and the volume of lumbar drgs are similar in mutant and wild type embryos. however,, the pool of lumbar drgs revealed a significant reduction of  <dig> % in the density of trka-expressing cells , n = 5; ndn ko:  <dig> , n = 5; *p <  <dig> )  and a reduction of  <dig> % in trkc-positive neurons , n = 5; ndn ko:  <dig> , n = 5; *p <  <dig> ) ) in the mutant embryos. the density of trkb-expressing neurons was not affected , n = 5; ndn ko:  <dig> , n = 5) .

at p <dig>  in order to confirm the loss of sensory neurons in ndn-ko drgs, we compared the expression of trka in l <dig> drgs specifically, between mutant and wild type neonates , n = 3; ndn ko:  <dig> , n = 3).

these data indicate that the abrogation of necdin results in a partial loss of sensory neurons expressing trka and trkc receptors. this loss occurs in early embryonic development and is maintained at birth. the number of trkb-expressing neurons appears similar in mutant and wild type animals.

apoptotic cell death is increased in developing drg neurons in necdin mutant
as the physiological wave of cell death among drgs neurons occurs mainly from e <dig>  to e <dig>   <cit> , we hypothesized that an increase of cell death could be responsible for the loss of sensory neurons in necdin mutants. we quantified cells undergoing dna fragmentation, using a tunel assay -mediated dutp nick end labelling), in the lumbar region and at different developmental stages  . in wild type mice, we observed an increase of apoptosis in the lumbar region between e <dig>  and e <dig> , as previously reported  <cit> . in necdin mutants, at e <dig>  , we observed no significant difference with the wild type control littermate , n = 5; ndn ko:  <dig> , n = 3). however, at e <dig> , we observed a significant 41% increase in the density of tunel positive cells in mutants compared to control drgs , n = 4; ndn ko:  <dig> , n = 3; * p <  <dig> ) . finally, at e <dig> , the density of tunel positive cells was equivalent in both mutants and wild type , n = 3; ndn ko:  <dig> , n = 3). double labelling using the tunel assay and immunostaining with anti-nf  revealed a colocalisation of both markers, indicating that dying cells are mainly post-mitotic. in accordance, tunel staining combined with brdu labelling  indicated that progenitors are not affected.

finally, in mutant mice, we compared serial sections marked either with fluorojade, a marker of non specific neuronal degeneration  <cit> , or with tunel staining. these two labellings, gave a similar, scattered pattern of stained neurons suggesting no increase of a necrotic non-apoptotic process in mutant drgs .

in conclusion, we observed an increase of apoptosis in necdin mutant lumbar drg mice at e <dig>  precisely, just before the normal peak of cell death occurring at e <dig> . this cell death is restricted to neurons and does not affect progenitors.

the increase of apoptosis observed in early sensory neuron development of necdin deficient mice is not dependent on p75ntr
different studies suggest that necdin could be involved in the signalling pathway mediated by p75ntr  <cit> . interestingly, mice with a targeted deletion in p75ntr show a partial loss of sensory neurons in drgs  <cit> . we propose that if the sensory neurons lost in necdin mutant embryos are those expressing p75ntr, then we would expect, at e <dig> , a reduction of the number of neurons expressing p75ntr in necdin mutant mice.

initially, in wild type embryos, we clarified the expression pattern of p75ntr in sensory neurons. we performed three separate double labelling experiments with a p75ntr riboprobe and either an anti-islet1/ <dig> antibody , an anti-necdin antibody , or an anti-runx <dig> antibody, labelling the trkc expressing neurons . colabelling results showed that p75ntr is expressed only in a subset of sensory neurons , in a subpopulation of necdin expressing neurons and more particularly in 40% of proprioceptive  neurons . noticeably, an equivalent amount  of trkc-positive cells was lost in necdin deficient mice.

we then compared the number of cells expressing p75ntr in the lumbar drgs of wild type and necdin mutant. at e <dig>  , the quantification of the p75ntr-expressing cells did not reveal any difference between wild type and mutant lumbar drgs , n = 3; ndn ko:  <dig> , n = 5). at e <dig> , this quantification is similar , n = 3; ndn ko:  <dig> , n = 4) as at p <dig> , n = 4; ndn ko:  <dig> , n = 3).

indeed, these results show that cell death observed in necdin mutant drgs does not affect specifically the p75ntr-expressing neurons and consequently does not directly involve the p75ntr-signalling pathway.

neurite outgrowth in developing sensory neurons of necdin mutants
to investigate whether necdin is required for axonal elongation in sensory neurons as has been previously suggested, in the superior cervical ganglia at e <dig>  <cit> , we examined the axonal outgrowth in wild type and mutant embryos in several structures innervated by the drgs sensory neurons. first, we performed a whole-mount immunostaining using anti-Î² tubulin iii  antibody, an axonal marker, to visualize the morphology and to measure the length of axons in mutants compared to wild type . we analyzed different nerves along the rostro-caudal axis. at e <dig> , in necdin mutant embryos, the brachial plexus, formed by the last three cervical and first two thoracic nerves, in the forelimb was appropriately patterned and all nerves emanating from it appear normal compared to wild type . at e <dig>  and e <dig> , peripheral spinal nerves were analysed quantitatively by measuring the length of nerves  innervating the trunk region. statistical analysis did not reveal any difference between mutant and wild type neither at e <dig>  , n = 4; ndn ko:  <dig> , n = 5) nor at e <dig>  , n = 7; ndn ko:  <dig> , n = 9) . thus, at early stages of development  our data suggest that necdin does not play a major role in axonal growth in those structures.

at e <dig> , when sensory axons from drg reach their targets, we examined whether axonal projections were correctly patterned. we performed immunohistochemistry with anti-parvalbumin antibody , which detects specifically proprioceptive  afferent fibers entering the spinal cord  <cit>  . comparison of pv-immunoreactive fibers in control  and necdin mutant mice  showed that axons extend correctly ventro-laterally through the gray matter from the dorsal column to the ventral horn. however, in mutant mice, pv-immunostaining showed a difference in the region of the intermediate spinal cord, close to a set of islet-positive neurons located in the deep dorsal horn  <cit> . we clearly observed that afferent projections from the proprioceptive neurons are reduced in the intermediate spinal cord .

finally at p <dig> and at adulthood, we examined the cutaneous innervation in the hindpads of mice, revealed by using immunofluorescence with an antibody for calcitonin gene-related product , a marker of nociceptive  afferent fibers. at p <dig> and adulthood, cgrp-immunoreactive fibers are found in the epidermis, around the hair follicles, in the upper dermis and around blood vessels as in wild type animals  and as previously described  <cit> . however, we noticed a reduction in the number of cgrp-immunoreactive fibers in mutant mice.

in conclusion, we did not observe any gross impairment of axonal outgrowth in early developmental stages  in our ndn ko embryos. later in development and in adult, we showed that pv-fibers and cgrp-fibers that express trkc and trka respectively are correctly patterned; however we detected a reduction in the number of fibers.

since we did not observe any gross impairment of axonal outgrowth in our ndn ko mice although others have reported such defects, specifically in vitro  <cit> , we then assessed in vitro the role of necdin on neurite outgrowth as it has been shown in a different ndn-ko mutant  <cit> . drg explants isolated from e <dig>  were cultured for  <dig> hours in the presence of either the neurotrophic factor nt <dig> or ngf. in the presence of nt <dig>  drg explants from wild type and ko extended neurites with similar length . however, in the presence of ngf, a significant reduction of  <dig> %  was observed in the length of neurites in necdin mutant explants cultured, compared to the control , suggesting that necdin deficiency impairs the neurites extension induced by ngf signalling in drgs explants.

discussion
until now, necdin function was investigated mainly by in vitro experiments, which suggested a role of necdin during proliferation, in neuronal differentiation and/or apoptosis. here, using a necdin knock-out mouse model, we have first analysed the sensory-motor function in adult mutants and second investigated the in vivo cellular function of necdin during the development of the mouse nervous system and in particular in sensory neurons of drgs.

in this instance, drgs are a system well adapted to study the cellular function of necdin in the nervous system. in drgs, neural progenitors coexist with differentiated sensory neurons throughout all of neurogenesis and the ontogeny of sensory neurons is well characterized in terms of origins, proliferation, determination, cell death and neuronal survival  <cit> .

necdin prevents apoptosis in early developing sensory neurons
thus necdin deficiency impairs lumbar sensory neuron development between e <dig>  and e <dig> , resulting in a loss of sensory neurons persisting at p <dig> and at adulthood . during this time frame, we observed in our control mice a wave of naturally occurring cell death as previously described  <cit> . we revealed a significant 41% increase of cell death in lumbar necdin mutant drgs compared to wild type. this increase concerns post-mitotic neurons only and occurs at e <dig> , just before the peak of naturally cell death, which is observed in normal mice at e <dig> . this increase of cell death was confirmed by caspase- <dig> staining and hoechst incorporation . thus, abrogation of necdin triggers an increase of early apoptosis via the caspase- <dig> pathway.

notably, this increase of apoptosis and subsequently the loss of sensory neurons observed in necdin mutant are specific to the lumbar region. no defect is detected at the thoraco-brachial level . however, at e <dig> , a similar loss of sensory neurons was obtained in the primary sensory neurons of the trigeminal ganglia .

clearly, at the cellular level, necdin prevents apoptosis but the mechanism is unclear. necdin could be an anti-apoptotic factor or equally it could be having a positive survival effect on the sensory neurons .

are specific neurotrophic factors and/or neurotrophic receptors involved in necdin signalling pathway?
the wave of cell death in normal developing drgs, at e <dig> , occurs before sensory axons have reached their targets and before neurons are actually exposed to target derived neurotrophic factors  <cit> . thus, at e <dig> , the role of necdin is probably independent of neurotrophic factors provided by the target. however necdin signaling pathway might depend on local action of neurotrophins or other growth factors.

the timing of neurotrophin/trk signalling requirements and the cell types affected by the neurotrophin deficiencies have been well studied  <cit> . it is assumed that a single neurotrophic factor might promote the survival of a specific population of sensory neurons, although phenotypic comparisons among mice with different mutations have revealed a considerable overlap in terms of neurotrophin requirements  <cit> . the abrogation of necdin results in a relatively selective loss of neurons in drgs: trka and trkc cell populations are reduced but not trkb population. a simple interpretation of that might be that necdin transduces a survival signal of ngf via trka  or/and of nt <dig> via trkc. considering that neurogenesis in developing drgs is a dynamic process and the expression patterns of the different trk proteins are also highly dynamic between e <dig>  and e <dig> , another interpretation is that the trka and trkc populations present at e <dig>  expressed a common receptor at an earlier stage of their development and required a common neurotrophic factor that could trigger necdin function as a survival factor.

another way to explain the mechanism, by which necdin could act as an anti-apoptotic/survival factor, is to consider the p75ntr pathway. previously, it has been shown that p75ntr interacts with necdin  <cit>  and a common signalling pathway involving necdin and p75ntr has been proposed  <cit> . furthermore, throughout development, necdin and p75ntr expression partially overlaps in the post-mitotic territories  <cit> . however, we did not observe any reduction in the number of neurons expressing p75ntr in necdin embryonic drgs compared to wild type. these data suggest that there is no direct genetic interaction between p75ntr and necdin to prevent the regulated cell death in post-mitotic developing sensory neurons.

cell proliferation is not increased in drgs of necdin deficient mice
necdin has been demonstrated to function as a "growth suppressor" in vitro, since its ectopic expression induces an arrest of cell growth  <cit> . considering such a role, we could hypothesize that the increase of cell death observed in drgs from mutant mice might be subsequent to a previous increase of proliferation. indeed these events are tightly linked and a compensation mechanism cannot be excluded  <cit> . an "anti-proliferative" role of necdin should induce, in necdin deficient drgs, a reduction in the pool of post-mitotic generated neurons and an increase of the number of precursors and/or an increase in cell death. three types of data do not support such a role in developing drgs: 1) at e <dig> , we did not observe any reduction of the number of trks expressing cells, including the entire pool of post-mitotic neurons at this stage; 2) we performed brdu labelling experiments at e <dig>  to assess the amount of proliferation in drgs and no difference was observed as checked by analysis on one representative lumbar drg; 3) the increase of apoptosis observed at e <dig>  is restricted to post-mitotic neurons and neither apoptosis nor necrosis of precursors were observed.

the abrogation of necdin does not disturb the axonal growth in early stages of neuronal differentiation
altogether, the analysis of axonal growth made in necdin mutant compared to wild type mice, suggests that, in vivo, necdin is not involved in early axonal outgrowth. later in development at e <dig> , we observed a reduced innervation from the trkc afferent fibers in the intermediate spinal cord, visualised by a parvalbumin labelling. thus this specific defect of the trkc neurons might suggest an involvement of necdin in axonal growth. however, we have shown that the lack of necdin leads to a loss of trkc expressing cells that in turn could explain the absence or reduction of afferent projections. in the same way, we observed that, qualitatively, the innervation of the cgrp afferent fibers  in the hindpads of wild type animals is similar in necdin adult mutant whereas the number of cgrp-positive nerves appears globally reduced. again the loss of trk a sensory neurons could explain this difference.

previous in vitro experiments  <cit>  suggest a function of necdin in neurite outgrowth depending on ngf. in our mutant, we investigated whether, independently of the increase of apoptosis observed, the surviving sensory neurons could normally extend neurites in drg explants cultures. we revealed a reduction in neurite outgrowth of e <dig>  embryonic drg mutant explants, dependant on ngf. this discrepancy between our in vitro results and our in vivo observations  might be explained by a role of necdin in late neuronal differentiation only. this necdin function is separable from its anti-apoptotic role previously revealed. with this in mind, we report a loss of 27% of trka expressing cells at e <dig>  and a 40% loss of trka expressing cells at p <dig>  a substantial reduction between e <dig>  and p <dig>  indeed, a role of necdin in neurite outgrowth depending on ngf might explain this discrepancy: a deficiency in axonal outgrowth would then lead to an alteration of neuronal differentiation and an additional loss of trka cell death, in later embryogenesis stages. furthermore, such a role would explain the observations reported by other groups  <cit> .

the necdin anti-apoptotic function is not restricted to sensory neurons
in drgs we observed an approximately 30% partial loss of all neurons. in previous work, such a loss has also been reported but not investigated in the hypothalamus of necdin mutants   <cit> . more generally, we observed an increase of cell death in a whole necdin embryo at an early stage of development , as revealed by an anti-caspase- <dig> labelling . this increase of apoptosis is not restricted to the nervous system but is extended to other tissues like somites or the extremities of members. an expression of necdin has previously been reported in these structures  <cit> .

thus we propose that necdin anti-apoptotic/survival function might be widespread in the nervous system and other tissues.

does the loss of sensory neurons explain the sensory defects observed in necdin ko adult mice?
sensory-motor studies on adult necdin deficient mice showed sensory alterations . these observations lead us to investigate the developing sensory neurons in drgs. in accordance, we found cellular defects and revealed a loss of nociceptive  and proprioceptive  sensory neurons. however considering the cellular defects, we cannot immediately explain the sensory defects observed: from a loss of sensory trka cells, we would expect an increased pain threshold in necdin deficient mice but we observe the opposite effect, .

furthermore from a loss of trkc-cells, we would expect an alteration of the stretch reflex circuit with a diminution of the h-wave amplitude whereas, again, we observe the opposite effect with an increase of the h-wave amplitude only. a similar effect was observed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disease in which a loss of motoneurons facilitates the stretch reflex circuit   <cit> . in both cases, these data suggest either a hyper-excitability of sensory neurons or a lack of neuronal inhibition.

thus to better understand the physiopathology of necdin mutant mice, it will be necessary to take into account 1) all the cellular effect of necdin in different neuronal populations and/or 2) the physiological compensation used by the organism to compensate for cellular impairment. interestingly, recent data  <cit>  suggest that necdin promotes gabaergic differentiation; thus, a lack of gabaergic neurons in ndn ko might lead a lack of neuronal inhibition.

CONCLUSIONS
our study reveals the sensory-motor behaviour of necdin deficient mice. overall, our data clarify the in vivo function of necdin in growth arrest, survival and differentiation through neurogenesis. we show clearly that, in early development of the nervous system, necdin is an anti-apoptotic or survival factor.
