BACKGROUND
due to the widespread use and even abuse of conventional antibiotics, antibiotic resistance is rampant all over the world, which limits the lifespan of commercial antibiotics and results in the urgent demand of new platforms for efficient antibiotic discovery  <cit> .

as an essential part of innate immunity, antimicrobial peptides  have been receiving increasing attention because of their unique antimicrobial mechanism against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and even including some multidrug-resistant strains over recent decades  <cit> . antimicrobial peptides are ubiquitous in all living organisms. more than  <dig> amps  have been identified and  <dig> peptides have been derived naturally  since the discovery of the lysozyme by alexander fleming in  <dig>  <cit> . although substantial amps have been discovered over the past decades, only a small part of them have been used because of high costs and potential cytotoxicity  <cit> . hence, finding efficient, nontoxic and low-cost amps is urgent in promoting amps’ practical applications.

the whole blood is a mixture of cells  and plasma , which delivers nourishment and oxygen to and removes waste products from all parts of the body  <cit> . components in blood, such as platelet concentrates  <cit> , defensins  <cit> , leukocyte extracts  <cit> , also play important roles in antimicrobial host defense. hemoglobin is the main component of the erythrocyte  <cit> . aside from the basic function of transporting oxygen, hemoglobin has been found as a source of various biological peptides . many amps called hemocidins have been isolated from hemoglobin cleavage in vivo  <cit>  or from hemoglobin hydrolysis by chemical reagents, physical methods, or enzymes in vitro  <cit> . to date, the hemocidins derived from human beings  <cit> , bovines  <cit> , rabbits  <cit> , swine  <cit> , crocodiles  <cit> , fish  <cit> , and shellfish  <cit>  have been reported and most of them are made up of  <dig> to  <dig> residues, characterized by a common random coil structural and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity . as a byproduct and even one of the major dissolved pollutants in slaughter house wastewater  <cit> , appropriate treatment of chicken blood is of great benefit to both environmental protection and economic development. however, hemocidins from poultry have not been documented yet. in this study, the hemocidins from chickens were isolated and their antimicrobial and bactericidal activities were further detected.

methods
materials and chemicals
all common chemical reagents and biological products were of analytical grade from commercial sources. papain  was purchased from sigma chemical co. .

preparation of chap
the chicken hemoglobin antimicrobial peptides  were prepared as modified method described before  <cit> . in brief, fresh chicken blood  was collected with heparin and then centrifuged with  <dig>  × g at 4 °c for 10 min. the upper liquid and white cells were removed and washed with sterilized saline. the procedures described above were repeated  <dig> times. the cells were frozen, thawed, stirred and homogenized in deionized water  with papain  proteolysis at 70 °c for 8 h. the digested suspensions were added with ice-cold aqueous 5% acetic acid solution  and extracted overnight at 4 °c. after being centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 30 min at 4 °c, the suspensions were collected as crude extracts, and the protein concentration was detected by nanodrop  <dig> uv–vis spectrophotometer . the ph of the extracts was adjusted to  <dig>  with sodium hydroxide. the crude extracts were loaded onto 10 × 300 mm sephadex g- <dig> column and eluted by  <dig>  mol l− <dig> sodium acetate buffer  with the speed of  <dig>  ml cm− <dig> h -1
. each elution was analyzed by agarose diffusion assay  <cit>  with escherichia coli atcc  <dig> as the indicator organism. the fractions with potent antibacterial activity were collected and detected with tricine sds-page  <cit>  and then subjected to mass spectrometry .

bacterial strains and growth conditions

staphylococcus aureus atcc <dig>  staphylococcus aureus atcc  <dig>  staphylococcus albus atcc <dig>  escherichia coli atcc  <dig>  escherichia coli o <dig>  escherichia coli c <dig>  escherichia coli c <dig>  pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc <dig>  pasteurellae gallinarum c48- <dig> were purchased from the china veterinary culture collection center . aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus and escherichia coli were clinically isolated from crucian carps, pigeon and equines respectively by laboratory of veterinary pathology and public health of the college of veterinary medicine, china agricultural university. staphylococcus aureus mr-l <dig>  mr-qd-cd <dig>  enterococcus faecalis 53a, 52a, 37 n and pseudomonas aeruginosa m <dig> and escherichia coli t <dig> were all multi-resistance strains of clinics, and obtained from beijing key laboratory of detection technology for animal food safety of the college of veterinary medicine. all the above gram-negative strains were grown in luria-bertani  agar and the gram-positive bacteria were grown in brain heart infusion  agar.

determination of antimicrobial and bactericidal activities
agarose diffusion assay
the primary antibacterial activities of chap elution  were detected by modified agarose diffusion assay as described before  <cit> . briefly, the single colony of each bacterial strain was grown in trypticase soy broth  overnight at 37 °c under aerobic conditions. 2 × 108 cfu ml− <dig> bacteria culture of each strain was added to warm  sterile agarose  . 10 μl samples were added to 3 mm wells punched by agar punch .  <dig>  mol l− <dig> sodium acetate  and 20000 iu penicillin-streptomycin solution of the same volume were added as negative and positive control, respectively. after being incubated overnight at 37 °c, the diameter of the each clean zone of growth inhibition was measured as the antibacterial activity of chap against different strains.

minimum inhibitory concentration  analysis
a micro dilution assay was employed to determine mic according to the broth micro dilution guideline of clinical and laboratory standards institute   <cit> . briefly, 50 μl of twofold serial dilutions of chap  was placed into wells of sterile 96-well cell culture plates. the 50 μl of bacterial suspensions  were added to the peptides. the wells were added with 50 μl of mueller- hinto  broth and 50 μl of bacterial culture was treated as positive and negative control, respectively. after 24 h incubation, the mics were determined at 492 nm by spectrophotometer .

time-dependent inhibitory assay
a 500 μl aliquot of chap with 2 × mic of the bacterium was added respectively to 500 μl bacterial suspensions  in the sterilized  <dig>  ml tubes as the treated groups. bacteria treated with 500 μl solvent  were set as the control groups. after being incubated for 30 min, 100 μl aliquot of the suspensions were pipetted into to a sterilized  <dig>  ml tube. after centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for 5 min, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl mhb medium. tenfold serially diluted suspension was placed on agar plates and incubated at 37 °c until viable colonies could be seen and the numbers of colony-forming units  were counted. the inhibitory rate of each bacterium was calculated according to the following formula: the inhibitory rate =  × 100%.

in order to further detect the process and speed of the antimicrobial activity of chap, the time growth curves and inhibitory rates of escherichia coli atcc  <dig>  staphylococcus aureus atcc <dig>  staphylococcus aureus mr-l <dig>  enterococcus faecalis 52a, pseudomonas aeruginoda m <dig> and escherichia coli t <dig> were achieved after the treated suspensions were incubated for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  90 min respectively.

minimal bactericidal concentration  analysis
the mbc values were determined in 96-well plates, which was similar to the method of mic. mbc values were further confirmed by plating 100 μl samples of each well with no visible turbidity onto the mhb medium. the least concentration showing no visible growth on the plates was considered as the mbc value.

time-dependent bactericidal assay
the time depending bactericidal curves of escherichia coli atcc  <dig> were determined as the time-dependent inhibitory assay mentioned above by adding chap with concentration of its mbc value to the bacterial cultures grown to early and late exponential phase as the reference  <cit> .

in order to detect the bacteriolysis against bacteria in stationary phase, 10 ml of bacterial culture  was treated with 10 × mic of chap. the culture treated with solvent  was set as the control group. after 24 h incubation, 2 ml of each culture was added to a glass tube and was photographed  <cit> .

bacterial biofilms assay
crystal violet staining method was applied to detect the effect of chap on the biofilm formation  <cit> . briefly, staphylococcus aureus atcc <dig> were cultured in tsb overnight. 100 μl bacterial suspensions  with 2 × mic, 1 × mic, 1/2 × mic, 1/4 × mic, 1/8 × mic, 1/16 × mic of chap were added to 96-well plates and the bacterial suspensions with no chap and the sterilized tsb were treated as control groups. after static culture at 37 °c for 24 h or shake culture  at 37 °c for 72 h, the contents were aspirated and the wells were washed by 200 μl pbs for three times, methanol fixed for 1 h and stained with 200 μl crystal violet  for 30 min. the wells were washed by running water and air dried. the plates were determined at 600 nm by spectrophotometer.

nacl permeability assay
the effect of chap on the nacl permeability of bacteria was detected as modified protocol as follows  <cit> . 100 μl of bacterial suspensions  with 1/2 × mic of chap were added to 96-well plates and the bacterial suspensions with no chap as control. 100 μl of nacl solutions with different concentrations  were added into each wells and incubated at 37 °c for 12 h. the bacterial concentration of each well was determined by measuring the optical density at 600 nm .

electron microscopy observations
both transmission electron microscopy  and scanning electron microscopy  were conducted as previously described . briefly, escherichia coli atcc  <dig> and staphylococcus aureus atcc <dig> were cultured overnight, 107 cfu ml− <dig> bacteria were incubated with 1 × mic of chap or diluents of the same volume at 37 °c for 30 min. all the samples were fixed and proceeded for the tem and sem respectively.

hemolytic assay and embryotoxicity assay
the hemolytic activity was evaluated as previously described  <cit> . 4%  fresh chicken erythrocyte suspensions were added to a 96-well plate and incubated with chap at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  μg ml− <dig> individually at 37 °c for 1 h. wells treated with pbs and  <dig> % triton x- <dig> of the same volume were taken as  <dig> and 100% hemolysis. the wells were determined by measuring the optical density at 492 nm .

the embryotoxicity of chap was detected as the following measures. the 10-days-old-chicken embryos were randomly divided into  <dig> groups, each of  <dig> eggs,  <dig>  ml of chap of 1 × mic, 2 × mic, 4 × mic, 6 × mic dose against escherichia coli atcc <dig> were injected into the chorio-allantoic cavity, and embryos treated with the same volume of solvent  were used as controls. the eggs were put in a hatching machine and hatchability and weight of the eggs were observed regularly until hatching.

stability in different temperatures and in 50% plasma
chap  was treated with different temperatures varying from 30 °c, 40 °c, 50 °c, 60 °c, 70 °c, 80 °c, 90 °c, 100 °c, 121 °c for 30 min. the antimicrobial activities of these treated aliquots were determined with agarose diffusion assay and were compared with chap stored in 4 °c.

the stability of chap in 50% plasma was evaluated as previously described  <cit>  with some modifications. briefly, the plasma of chicken and rabbit was determined with no antimicrobial activity before the test. then 640 μg ml− <dig> chap was diluted 1: <dig> in fresh chicken and rabbit plasma and pre-incubated at 37 °c for  <dig>   <dig>  and 6 h respectively. after incubation, the antimicrobial activity of each sample was determined by agarose diffusion assay. the effect of chap diluted by its solvent was regarded as the 100%, and the effect of the treated samples was demonstrated as percentages.

statistical analysis
experiments were conducted with biological replicates and experimental data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation of at least three determinations and analyzed by one-way anova using spss  <dig>  . differences were considered to be statistically significant at p <  <dig>  or p <  <dig> .

bacterial biofilms assay
the formation of biofilms of staphylococcus aureus atcc <dig> was decreased with the increase of the concentration of chap . the 2 × mic, 1 × mic, 1/2 × mic, 1/4 × mic, 1/8 × mic of chap could inhibited the formation of biofilms  in 24 h and 2 × mic, 1 × mic, 1/2 × mic, 1/4 × mic of chap could significantly decrease the formation of biofilms  in 72 h. remarkably, in the  <dig> × mic and  <dig> × mic groups, there were almost no biofilm formation.

nacl permeability assay
as shown in fig. 3c and d, the values of od <dig> of escherichia coli atcc  <dig> and staphylococcus aureus atcc <dig> cultures decreased with the increased concentration of nacl solution and reached to their minimum values at concentration above 160 g l− <dig> and above 140 g l− <dig>  respectively. by adding chap, the value of od <dig> in both escherichia coli atcc  <dig> and staphylococcus aureus atcc <dig> groups decreased to the lowest value at concentration of nacl above 120 g l− <dig>

discussion
since the first anti-streptococcus peptide was identified from the cow’s milk  <cit> , the enzyme strategy of isolating amps on a large scale has been a feasible method as bolscher postulated  <cit> . our lab isolated the peptides from the hemoglobin of chickens by using a simple and practical way and studied the antimicrobial activities against  <dig> bacterial strains, including  <dig> multidrug-resistant bacteria. at the same time, the properties such as hemolytic activity, embryotoxicity and stability in different temperatures and plasma were detected, which laid a foundation for its further employment in agricultural production, public health and medication.

antibiotics have been helping humans to fight against hazardous infections since alexander fleming discovered the first antibiotic, penicillin, in  <dig>  <cit> . however, resistance to most antibiotics was discovered shortly after their applications. for example, penicillin resistance arose in  <dig> just one year after its introduction to clinics  <cit> . the main target of most amps is cell membrane and there are several models for explaining the process such as barrel-stave pore model, thoroidal pore model and carpet model  <cit> , and it tends to be difficult for bacteria to totally change this basic structure to resist the effect of amps  <cit> . given the unique antimicrobial mechanism of amps, it was not surprising that most amps induced little or no resistance  <cit> . although there are reports and doubts about the resistance of some peptides  <cit> , there is no report about the natural ones so far, which means the development of natural amps is high in potential.

in our study, both the antimicrobial and bactericide results showed that chap was capable of strong and rapid activities against various bacteria and even some multi-resistant strains, implying its wider utility in the prevention and treatment of infectious agents, which was similar with the hemosidins reported before  <cit> . by specifically analyzing the results above, there was no obvious difference between the antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria and gram-positive bacteria, even between the standard strains and the multi-resistant strains, suggesting that the target of chap is the common component of bacteria such as the cell membrane like most amps reported before  <cit> . the biofilm and the nacl permeability results showed that chap could inhibit the formation of bacterial biofilms and change the permeability of some gram-negative bacteria and gram-positive bacteria to some extent. with the confirmation of the mechanism of most amps, the em observations further revealed that chap could accumulate copious pathogens nearby and punch through their cell surfaces swiftly  <cit> . however the specific mechanism needs to be further investigated.

as a double-edged sword, the unique mechanism of targeting cell membranes could also lead to the low selection of some amps  <cit> . hence, toxicity especially hemolysis and safety problems, are constantly an obstacle to their final applications  <cit> . according to our study, chap demonstrated low hemolysis and embryotoxicity even at rather high concentrations, which further implied that there was relative high selectivity of chap between eukaryote cells and prokaryote cells.

good stability also plays an important role in the application of any biological product. as for the amps, the substances such as ions and proteolytic enzymes in the serum may reduce their biological ability to a large extent  <cit> . in this study, chap kept high antimicrobial activity in two kinds of animal serum and different temperatures, suggesting its convenient application, transportation and storage.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study firstly reported a practical method of isolating chicken hemosidins  from the byproduct and even the pollutant of chicken-slaughtering industries. chap has an attractive antimicrobial and bactericidal ability with low hemolysis, low or none in toxicity and good temperature resistance and high stability in serum, which well accounts for their potential of expanding production and high development value in animal medication, breeding industry and environment protection.
