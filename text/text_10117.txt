BACKGROUND
ribosome biogenesis is fundamental to cell growth and accounts for a substantial proportion of a cell's energy expenditure  <cit> . the ribosomal rnas  are central to the ribosome structure and function  <cit> . the rrna genes exist as tandem repeats and form the foci upon which the nucleoli form. the rrna precursor  is synthesized from the genes by rna polymerase i and assembled with ribosomal proteins to form the 90s pre-ribosome. this 90s preribosome is matured to form the large-60s ribosomal subunit and the small-40s ribosomal subunit. the 60s subunit contains the 28s,  <dig> s and 5s rrnas as well as approximately  <dig> proteins, whereas the 40s subunit contains the 18s rrna and approximately  <dig> proteins. it is estimated that  <dig> proteins are involved in assembling the mature ribosomes  <cit> . many of them have been studied in yeast, but not in mammals. nonetheless, the proteins are highly conserved and as a starting point, it is reasonable to assume that they function similarly in mammals.

emg <dig>  was initially identified as "essential for mitotic growth" in yeast  <cit> , and later was shown to be involved in the biogenesis of the mature 40s ribosome  <cit> . yeast emg <dig>  is a  <dig> kda protein primarily detected in the nucleolus  <cit> . because the deletion of yemg <dig> in yeast is lethal, temperature sensitive mutations in this gene have been used to study the effects of its deficiency. depletion of yemg <dig> resulted in a reduction in 18s rrna, a decrease in 40s ribosomal subunits and an increase in the ratio of 60s to 40s ribosomal subunits  <cit> . these findings indicate an important role for emg <dig> in the biogenesis of the 40s ribosome.

deciphering the precise role of emg <dig> in 40s ribosome biogenesis has been challenging. a temperature sensitive mutation in yemg <dig> could be suppressed by the methyl donor s-adenosyl methionine   <cit>  or deletion of the snr <dig> gene encoding a snorna needed for 2'-o-ribose-methylation of g <dig> in the 18s rrna  <cit> . furthermore, yemg <dig> was found to interact directly with snorna  <cit>  and the 18s rrna  <cit> . taken together, these findings suggested that yemg <dig> functions to methylate the 18s rrna, a concept that was later supported by the identification of yemg <dig> as a sam-dependent pseudouridine-n1-specific methyltransferase  <cit> .

the emg <dig> protein is highly conserved from archaebacteria to humans or mice  <cit> . expression of the human orthologue of emg <dig> in yeast demonstrates that it is capable of suppressing the lethal defect in yemg <dig> cells, indicating that emg <dig> is both structurally and functionally conserved among these eukaryotes  <cit> . more recently, a mutation in human emg <dig>  which significantly reduces emg <dig> protein levels, has been found to cause bowen-conradi syndrome , an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severely impaired prenatal and postnatal growth, profound psychomotor retardation, and death in early childhood  <cit> . this finding strongly suggests that emg <dig>  as a key molecule in ribosomal synthesis, could be important for development. to get a better understanding of this, in the present study, we have attempted to generate an emg1-deficient mouse and characterize the expression of emg <dig> during mouse development. our data demonstrates that emg <dig> is essential for mouse pre-implantation development.

RESULTS
expression of emg <dig> during mouse embryogenesis
as a first step toward elucidating the role of emg <dig> during development, we analyzed the expression of the emg <dig> gene in mouse embryos and postnatal tissues. using rna in situ hybridization, emg <dig> expression was readily detected in e <dig>  morula embryos , with the strongest expression associated with the inside cells in the late stage of morula . high levels of emg <dig> mrna were also detected in the inner cell mass  of mouse blastocysts , but not in the trophectoderm . this expression pattern is consistent with emg <dig> being expressed highly in the embryo proper, but weakly expressed or not detectable in the trophoblasts of mouse placenta .

expression of emg <dig> in mouse pre-implantation embryos was also analyzed by determining the activity of lacz in emg <dig> knockout heterozygotes in which the expression of the lacz transgene was regulated by the endogenous emg <dig> regulatory elements . crosses of wild-type males with emg1+/- females revealed a positive lacz signal in zygotes and in 2-cell embryos, which was not present in those from breeding emg1+/- males with wild-type females , indicating that these early mouse embryos could contain maternally transmitted emg <dig>  however, starting at the 8-cell morula stage, there were two distinct lacz-staining patterns for the embryos collected from the breeding of wild-type males with emg1+/- females . among these embryos, emg1+/- showed wide-spread lacz staining, whereas the ones that were genotyped as emg1+/+ exhibited a weak disperse staining which could be from residual maternally transmitted lacz proteins. this data indicates that the onset of zygotic expression of emg <dig> may occur at the 8-cell morula stage. in addition, x-gal staining of e <dig>  emg1+/- blastocysts showed strong lacz staining in the icm, but not in the trophectoderm , which is consistent with emg <dig> expression detected by in situ hybridization .

to determine the expression pattern of emg <dig> in post-implantation embryos, mouse embryos at e <dig> -e <dig>  were analyzed. at e <dig> -e <dig> , emg <dig> was widely and strongly expressed and showed no clear tissue-specific pattern . at later stages , however, emg <dig> was found to be expressed at a low level in most embryonic tissues, but strongly in several regions, including the ventricular zone of the neuroepithelium , the neural layer of retina , the follicles of vibrissae , thymus , submandibular glands , brown adipose tissue , lung , nephric tubules and renal mesenchyme  and seminiferous tubules in the testis .

to examine the expression of emg <dig> in extraembryonic tissue, we performed rna in situ hybridization on e <dig> -e <dig>  mouse placenta. no emg <dig> signal was detected in the trophoblast cells, while a control gene, rtel  showed strong expression in this cell lineage   <cit> .

in adult mice, similar levels of emg <dig> mrna were detected in multiple tissues by northern blot hybridization , suggesting that emg <dig> could be widely expressed during postnatal development. however, using rna in situ hybridization assays, emg <dig> cell-specific expression patterns were detected in several tissues . in the adult testis, emg <dig> is highly and specifically expressed in both spermatogonia and early meiotic spermatocytes, but not in late stage spermatocytes . a strong emg <dig> signal was also identified in oocytes and the granulosa cells of the pre-antral follicles in the ovary . in the adult mouse brain, emg <dig> expression was mainly detected in the granular layer of neurons of the cerebellum  as well as in the hippocampus . specific expression of emg <dig> was also found in the crypts of the intestine .

taken together, our gene expression data indicates that emg <dig> is broadly distributed in the early developing embryos, but its expression is more restricted in the later stages of development. in adult mice, emg <dig> also exhibits cell-specific expression, most notably in the gonads, brain and intestine. this expression pattern suggests that emg <dig> may not only be important for early embryonic development, but could also be required for the development of several cell lineages at late developmental stages or during postnatal development.

generation of the emg <dig> null mouse allele
to further study the developmental role of emg <dig>  we have mutated emg <dig> in mice by homologous recombination. the mouse emg <dig> gene contains  <dig> exons that encode a protein composed of  <dig> amino acids. in order to create an emg <dig> null allele, a gene-targeting vector with a splice acceptor -ires-βgeo-pa cassette was used to replace exons 2- <dig> and to remove approximately 80% of the emg <dig> coding sequence . given that emg <dig> is highly expressed in es cells, the inserted sa-iresβgeo cassette in the first intron of the emg <dig> locus will trap exon  <dig> to turn on the expression of βgeo, a fusion protein of lacz and neo. this was designed to allow us to significantly increase the targeting frequency, while also allowing us to establish a mouse allele in which a lacz reporter is regulated by the endogenous emg <dig> regulatory elements. indeed, approximately 25%  of the es colonies obtained after g <dig> selection showed correct homologous recombination by southern blot analysis using both 5' and 3' probes external to the targeting vector . furthermore, lacz transgene expression in emg+/- embryos was entirely consistent with the expression pattern established by in situ hybridization . in this study, we have used two independently targeted es lines to generate germline-transmitting chimeras that were bred with 129s <dig> or cd <dig> females to produce emg <dig> null mutants for functional analysis.

the pre-implantation lethality of emg <dig> null mutants
both emg1+/- males and females were normal and fertile, and transmitted the targeted allele to about 50% of their progeny. however, no homozygous offspring were born from emg1+/- intercrosses , indicating that loss of emg <dig> function leads to embryonic lethality. to determine at which stage of development the homozygous mutant embryos died, timed heterozygous matings were performed. an analysis of embryos between e <dig> -e <dig>  revealed that none of the  <dig> embryos genotyped were emg1-/-. the expected mendelian frequency of heterozygote, homozygote and wild-type was only observed in the pre-implantation embryos , indicating that mice lacking emg <dig> protein stopped developing at the pre- and/or peri-implantation stages.

to address this further, we analyzed more than  <dig> pre-implantation embryos collected from two independent mouse lines carrying the emg <dig> knockout allele. at e <dig> , emg1+/- intercrosses yielded early stage embryos that were indistinguishable from each other, despite the presence of emg1-/- mutations among these progeny . in addition, all the emg1-/- embryos at this developmental stage showed similar brdu incorporation , and nearly undetectable levels of apoptosis, like that of the wild-type controls , indicating that emg1-/- embryos were not blocked at the e <dig>  stage.

the e <dig>  embryos from emg1+/- intercrosses, however, consistently showed a mixture of morula and blastocyst-stage embryos. genotyping of these embryos demonstrated that whereas the blastocysts were either emg1+/+ or emg1+/- heterozygotes, the morula-stage embryos were emg1-/- mutants . in emg1-/- morulae, the blastomeres flattened and tightly aligned themselves against each other to form a compact ball of cells. immunofluoresence  with anti-e-cadherin antibody revealed that emg-/- morulae exhibited the same organized pattern of e-cadherin along the cell boundaries as the wild-type control . these data indicate that emg-/- embryos do reach the compaction stage of morula development.

to determine whether emg1-/- embryos at e <dig>  were arrested at this stage or simply delayed, we further cultured these embryos in vitro. after  <dig> h of culture, while emg1+/+ and emg1+/- e <dig>  embryos formed expanded blastocysts, none of the e <dig>  emg1-/- embryos developed to blastocysts . instead, many cells in the cultured mutant embryos showed fragmented, pyknotic nuclei, suggestive of cell death. to determine whether cell death is indeed increased in these cultured mutant embryos, we performed a tunel assay. a significantly higher number of tunel-positive nuclei were detected in the mutant embryos than in emg1+/+ embryos . in addition, very few cells in the cultured mutant embryos were positive in the brdu labeling assay . these data clearly indicate that emg1-/- embryos arrest prior to forming the blastocyst and subsequently the embryos undergo degeneration. because of this severe phenotype, no emg1-deficient cells could be established to perform further molecular investigations.

specification of early cell lineages in emg1-/- embryos
the failure of emg1-/- embryos to form blastocysts could suggest a defect in the specification of early cell lineages in these mutant embryos. to test this, we analyzed the expression of several early cell lineage markers, including oct <dig>  nanog and cdx <dig>  in e <dig>  emg1-/- embryos. these markers have been shown to be widely expressed in the blastomeres of cleavage stage embryos, but become restricted to the different lineages, i.e. oct <dig> and nanog in icm and cdx <dig> in trophectoderm, after initiation of blastocyst formation  <cit> . using these lineage markers, we found that although e <dig>  emg1-/- embryos did not form the oct-3/ <dig> or nanog-positive icm like that of emg1+/+ blastocysts, the blastomeres in the mutant embryos displayed levels of expression of these markers similar to wild type . however, the expression of cdx <dig> was consistently found to be significantly decreased in the mutant embryos as compared to the controls . these results suggest that loss of emg <dig> function more specifically down-regulates the expression of cdx <dig> in the blastomeres of the cleavage stage embryos, which might then influence the allocation or morphogenesis of cell lineages during early embryogenesis.

ribosomal biogenesis in emg1-/- mutants
emg <dig> has been shown to be a highly conserved nucleolar protein required for ribosome biogenesis  <cit> . emg1-null mutants exhibit arrested development prior to the blastocyst stage, similar to that observed in other mouse models that lack factors involved in ribosomal rna synthesis or processing, including rbm <dig>   <cit> , pescadillo- <dig>   <cit> , fibrillarin  <cit> , rna polymerase i or ii  <cit> , bysl  <cit> , surf <dig>  <cit>  and rps <dig>   <cit> . some of these genetic mutations have been clearly demonstrated to cause severe defects in ribosomal biogenesis  <cit> . thus, loss of emg <dig> function in mice could also disrupt this biological pathway, leading to pre-implantation lethality.

to address this question, we first determined whether loss of emg <dig> could affect nucleologenesis during pre-implantation development. as demonstrated previously, "de novo" nucleologenesis which begins at the two-cell stage is critical for the resumption of rrna transcription during early embryogenesis  <cit> . this process involves the morphological transformation of the nucleolus precursor body  to a mature, tripartite nucleolus as seen in the blastocysts  <cit> . to determine the effect of the emg <dig> gene-deletion on nucleologenesis, we performed if staining for the nucleolar makers b23/nucleophosmin and fibrillarin in e <dig>  embryos harvested from emg1+/- intercrosses. as shown in figure  <dig>  in e <dig>  emg1+/+ or emg1+/- embryos, the nucleoli are smaller and more irregular than npbs in e <dig>  morula, indicating a striking maturation occurred at this developmental stage. in contrast, the nucleoli in e <dig>  emg1-/- embryos still showed the large ring shape, closely resembling the npbs observed in e <dig>  wild-type morula. therefore, these data strongly suggest that deletion of the emg <dig> gene arrests nucleologenesis during early embryonic development.

to determine if emg1-/-embryos exhibit defective 40s ribosome biogenesis, similar to yeast depleted in yemg <dig>  we examined the level of mature 18s rrna using reverse transcription  followed by pcr. although the levels of 18s rrna are significantly reduced in yeast depleted in yemg <dig>  no detectable decrease in 18s rrna were detected in emg1-/- morulae at e <dig>  as compared to wild-type embryos at the same developmental stage . since e <dig>  mouse morulae could contain residual maternal rrnas, we used the same approach to analyze 18s rrna in e <dig>  emg1-/- embryos as compared to wild-type embryos with the same developmental stage. again, no difference was observed . given that the levels of 18s rrna in cells are very high, and small differences would not be detectable using this assay, we also looked for an increase in the precursors to the 18s rrna, the pre-rrna, but again no obvious difference between emg1-/- and wild type or heterozygous embryos was detected . the unchanged expression of 18s rrna and 47s rrna in emg1-/- embryos was also indicated by rt followed by real-time pcr analysis . although this data differs from that in yeast, it is still possible that there is a delay in ribosomal rna processing or assembly that was not detected using these assays. more sensitive approaches such as metabolic labeling or pre-rrna specific probes may be required to show a delay in rrna processing, as was recently shown in the study of a protein required for the maturation of the 60s ribosomal subunit in human cells  <cit> . however, due to the early pre-implantation lethality of the emg <dig> null allele, we are unable to derive emg1-deficient cells in which to perform these assays. future experiments with a conditional knockout of emg <dig> will greatly help to address the role of emg <dig> in the regulation of ribosomal biogenesis during development.

p <dig> deficiency does not rescue the pre-implantation arrest of emg1-/- mice
previous studies have found that mutations in many proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis lead to an up-regulation of p <dig>  <cit> , a key regulator of the cell cycle and apoptosis. the importance of p <dig> in the regulation of ribosome biogenesis has been addressed by studies showing that inhibition of p <dig> can suppress the effects of some defects in ribosome biogenesis. in mice, p <dig> inhibition was found to suppress the effects of mutation of tcof   <cit>  and rps <dig>   <cit> . these findings suggest that the inhibition of p <dig> may suppress the detrimental effects of mutations in other disorders of ribosomal biogenesis, such as emg <dig> deficiency. to test this, e <dig>  embryos were collected from intercrosses of emg1/p <dig> double heterozygotes  or emg1+/-/p53-/-. a total of  <dig> emg1-/-/p53-/- e <dig>  embryos were identified, and all of them were found to be arrested at morula stage like the emg-/- null mutants . in addition, none of e <dig>  emg1-/-/p53-/- embryos developed to blastocysts during in vitro culture. taken together, these data demonstrate that p <dig> inactivation fails to rescue the pre-implantation arrest of the emg <dig> null allele.

in summary, we have demonstrated that emg <dig> is essential for mouse pre-implantation. we showed that loss of emg <dig> function specifically arrests early embryonic development at the morula stage, preventing blastocyst formation. this phenotype is consistent with our expression data showing that emg <dig> is highly expressed during this critical developmental stage. however, due to the high expression of emg <dig> in mouse oocytes , which could be maternally transmitted into early developing embryos like other nucleolar components  <cit>  , we could not exclude the possibility that emg <dig> is also required before the morula stage. future experiments with a conditional knockout of emg <dig> specifically in mouse oocytes will allow us to answer this question. nevertheless, our study highlights a critical role of emg <dig> in mouse early embryonic development.

the importance of emg <dig> in development has also been demonstrated by our recent finding that this gene is mutated in human bcs syndrome, a severe developmental disorder with prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, profound psychomotor deficit, and death in early childhood  <cit> . because of this mutation, the emg <dig> protein was found to be significantly reduced in fibroblasts of bcs patients  <cit> . the residual protein that is detected is likely necessary to allow survival, as mice with a complete deficiency of emg <dig> exhibit pre-implantation lethality. therefore, the involvement of emg <dig> in development could be dose-dependant. the hypomorphic mutation of emg <dig> in bcs could specifically affect late embryonic development or certain cell lineages to cause bcs-associated phenotypes. in line with this, in this study, we found that emg <dig> is predominately expressed in distinct cell types at late embryonic developmental stages or in adult . the unique expression of emg <dig> in the granular neurons of cerebellum or in hippocampus could underly an important role for emg <dig> in the control of psychomotor development, whose dysfunction is characteristic of bcs. future experiments with mouse alleles to allow knockin of the bcs mutation, or a conditional allele, will allow us to address the pathological role of emg <dig> in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
we have provided direct genetic evidence that emg <dig> is essential for mouse pre-implantation. given the requirement of yemg <dig> in the biogenesis of the ribosomal 40s subunit, our study also highlights the critical role of ribosomal biogenesis in early development. the absolute requirement for emg <dig> in mouse development is consistent with its essential role in yeast. further, our findings also lend support to the previous study that showed bowen-conradi syndrome results from a partial emg <dig> deficiency. a complete deficiency would not be expected to be compatible with a live birth.
