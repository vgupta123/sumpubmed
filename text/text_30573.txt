BACKGROUND
quercus  belongs to the fagaceae family which also contains the genera castanea , fagus , lithocarpus  and castanopsis. oaks constitute a major component of northern hemisphere forests, extending from temperate to tropical regions  <cit> . oaks provide raw material for different uses but also afford important environmental services . these long-lived organisms are also considered good models for studies of the short- and long-term mechanisms of adaptation to the abiotic and biotic constraints associated with global climate change, because they grow under a wide range of soil and climatic conditions  <cit> . the traits involved in adaptation are complex, so exploration of the entire genome is required to locate the genes involved.

the species of the quercus genus are diploid . haploid dna content varies between the species, ranging from  <dig> mb in q. velutina to  <dig> mb in q. coccifera and q. ilex, and  <dig> mb in q. robur  <cit> , corresponding to five times the size of the arabidopsis genome  and approximately twice the size of the poplar genome .

large collections of oak expressed sequence tags  have been generated from various tissues and developmental stages, including  <dig>  sanger sequences and  <dig> m 454-reads, available from public databases  <cit> . this catalog constitutes a useful resource for detecting candidate genes controlling traits of interest and for the development of new genetic markers for forward genetics approaches  for dissection of the genetic architecture of adaptive traits  <cit> . however, little is known about the overall structure of the oak genome.

bacterial artificial chromosome  genomic libraries provide a source of large genomic dna insert clones for physical mapping, gene isolation, comparative studies of gene organization between species and sequencing projects  <cit> . despite carrying large inserts of genomic dna , bac clones display low rates of de novo rearrangement and are easy to handle. bac libraries are thus widely used as genomic tools for diverse organisms, including forest tree species . with the recently introduced strategies of genome sequencing combining bac end sanger sequences  with sequence reads from next-generation sequencing technologies, it has now become possible to sequence the oak genome. in this context, the use of bess should make it possible to develop scaffolding over long distances, thus ensuring the long-range contiguity of the assembly particularly for large and heterozygous genomes  <cit> . we had two main aims in this study: i) to construct and characterize a bac library for quercus robur, and ii) to characterize the composition of the oak genome by sequencing and analyzing bess. a  <dig> × coverage library was obtained and an analysis of  <dig>  bess provided insight into the structure and composition of the oak genome.

RESULTS
bac library characterization
estimation of mean insert size
this library consists of  <dig>  clones stored into  <dig> 384-well plates. we evaluated the mean size of bac inserts by randomly selecting  <dig> clones, extracting their dna and digesting it with the rare cutter enzyme noti for analysis by pfge . the mean size of the inserts was  <dig> kb with insert size ranging from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb. over 85% of the bac clones carried an insert larger than  <dig> kb and only 1% had inserts smaller than  <dig> kb . the percentage of empty clones was estimated at 7% for the total library . the empty clones probably resulted from problems in colony picking.

screening the library for cytoplasmic dna sequences
we investigated the frequency of bac clones containing chloroplast  and mitochondrial  dna sequences in the library by carrying out pcr with specific primers to screen a subset of the library consisting of  <dig> individual bac clones. amplification products were detected for  <dig> bac clones, indicating a low frequency of clones derived from the chloroplast genome . no bac clone containing mt dna was detected .

estimation of genome coverage
the approximate haploid genome size of quercus robur has been estimated at  <dig> mb  <cit> . based on mean insert size, the frequency of cytoplasmic sequences and the number of empty clones, the coverage of this library was estimated at 12×. we used the clarke - carbon equation  <cit>  to estimate the probability of covering the genome: n = ln/ln, where n is the number of clones in the library, gs is genome size, and i is the insert size. in our case, the probability of recovering any sequence of interest from the library was more than 99%. moreover, the high degree of genome coverage and the mean insert size of  <dig> kb make this library suitable for diverse applications such as physical mapping, map-based cloning and genome sequencing.

depth of genome coverage
the theoretical genome coverage of the bac library was validated by pcr screening of the library with  <dig> genetic markers detecting unique loci . library screening was facilitated by forming plate pools for  <dig> plates corresponding to the equivalent of seven genomes. for a unique co-dominant locus, we expected a mean of seven hits. all but three of the markers detected at least one positive pool plate. in total,  <dig> pool plates were identified and the number of bac clones detected by each marker ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  giving a mean of seven bac clones per marker. thus, the calculated depth of coverage was confirmed by screening the library with  <dig> genetic markers by pcr . however, the library is not entirely random because not all the sequences tested were represented. this bias may be due to the use of ecori for cloning or may reflect the presence of genomic regions in which the ecori site is underrepresented. the use of several enzymes is usually recommended to achieve complete representation of the genome  <cit> . we therefore constructed a second bac library for the same q. robur genotype, using hindiii as the cutting enzyme . both libraries are available at the cnrgv  <cit>  and picme  <cit>  repository centers for library and clone distribution. a set of  <dig>  clones is also being sequenced  to characterize this second library.

bac end sequences
we sequenced  <dig>  bac clones from both ends. after trimming of the sanger reads for vector, e. coli contamination and low read quality, we retained  <dig>   bac ends for further analysis . we had forward and reverse sequences for 71% of these bess , giving  <dig>  bes mate pairs. the mean length of high-quality reads was  <dig> bp with a mean gc content of  <dig> % . although lower than the gc content estimated by colorimetry , this figure is similar to that found for the complete genomes of arabidopsis , poplar  <cit> , yellow poplar  <cit>   and grapevine . however, gc content may be biased by the restriction enzyme used to generate the bac clones, as found in tomato  <cit> . a noticeable difference in gc content was observed between bess with  and without a protein signature .

comparison of the bess with the chloroplast  genomes of oak , poplar  and grapevine  confirmed the low frequency of cp sequences in the library . the mitochondrial  genome of oak has not yet been sequenced, so we searched for homologous mt sequences by comparison with the grapevine mt genome. less than 1% of our bess showed significant matches with the grapevine mt genome . these values are consistent with the estimates obtained by pcr screening with cp- and mt-specific primers.

classical repeat analysis and classification
based on similarity searches in the repeat database,  <dig> % of the nucleotides in the oak bess were identified as belonging to known repeats. class i retrotransposons were the most abundant repeats, with a total of  <dig>  retroelements . bess homologous to retrotransposons were further classified as line  or ltr elements   . ty1/copia elements were the most abundant retroelements. similar figures have been reported for the apple  <cit> , grapevine  <cit> , carrot  <cit>  and banana  <cit>  genomes. by contrast, gypsy retroelements are the most abundant in clementine, poplar, arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . the proportion of retrotransposons was half that reported for rapeseed , arabidopsis  and black cottonwood  and was much lower than that for carrot  and grapevine . however, the low repeat content may be due to the use of ecori in construction of the oak library. in tomato, ecori bess were found to contain far fewer repeats than hbai or mboi bess. in potato, ecori bess also had lower retroelement content than hindiii bess. ecori shows methyl sensitivity limiting the restriction of highly methylated regions of the genome where repeat elements are usually found.

a - numbers indicate the percentages of bess displaying similarity to a repeat from the indicated category.

identification of novel repeats
similarity-based repeat detection may be limited by the size and diversity of the repeat database. we therefore carried out a self-comparison of the bess, to identify previously unknown putative repetitive sequences. if a region of a bes has multiple hits with many other bess, these sequences probably correspond to novel repetitive sequences. even with the stringent threshold requirement -- that each  <dig> bp window matches a bes with at least 90% identity --  <dig> %  of the oak bess matched at least one other bes . similar results were obtained when repetitive elements and low-complexity sequences were masked, slightly decreasing the number of matching bess from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . for the purposes of comparison, we performed the same analysis on two fruit trees and one forest tree: carita papaya , citrus clementina bess  and populus trichocarpa , then the probability that two  <dig> bp sequences with 90% sequence identity have a match equals p <dig> =  <dig>  =  <dig>  ×  <dig> e- <dig>  under the null hypothesis, the distribution of the number of match is a binomial distribution with  <dig>  trials and a probability of success equals to p <dig>  since the probability p <dig> is close to  <dig>  the probability to have no match equals  <dig>  that means that as soon as a bes has a match with another bes it can be considered repeated. if the calculation of p <dig> is done from the empirical frequencies observed on the oak genome, p <dig> =  <dig>  × 1e- <dig> but the conclusions are the same since the probability to have no match equals  <dig>  that is to say that as soon as a bes has a match with another bes, it can be considered repeated. this result suggests that oak bess contained other repeat elements not yet identified in other plants.

characterization of oak repeat elements 
despite the masking of known repeat elements in our bess,  <dig> % could be considered as putative repeats. datema et al. carried out a similar analysis on potato and tomato  <cit> . based on the criterion that at least 50% of a given sequence matches another bes with at least 90% identity, 52% of the nucleotides in the tomato bess displayed matches with at least one other tomato bes and 19% displayed matches with at least five other bess. potato bess displayed a lower degree of redundancy than those of tomato; 39% of the nucleotides in the potato bess had a hit with at least one other bes, and  <dig> % had a hit with at least five other bess. the authors concluded that the remaining redundancy after repeat masking might correspond to novel repetitive or duplicated sequences. in carrot, high levels of redundancy were found to be due to repetitive elements not previously identified in other plants  <cit> . by considering the bes with a minimum of  <dig> hits, the authors characterized  <dig> carrot repetitive elements. in the oak bes data set we identified  <dig> repeat sequences among the  <dig>  bess presenting at least six matches with other bess. for confirmation that these sequences were unique to the oak genome, we queried them against the ncbi genbank non-redundant nucleic acid sequence database, the ncbi genbank est database , the swissprot database, the tigr plant repeat databases, the triticeae repetitive sequence database and the giri repeat database. none of these repeat sequences matched protein sequences in the swissprot database but  <dig> repeat sequences matched at least one accession in the other databases. these sequences were removed from our list of putative oak repetitive elements . of the remaining  <dig> ores,  <dig> matched oak ests,  <dig> motif matched fagaceae ests ,  <dig> motif matched a quercus suber retrotransposon 'qsub2' in the nr database, and  <dig> motifs specifically matched oak bess corresponding to unknown repetitive sequences . these  <dig> ores were present in seven to  <dig> copies in the bes database and their sizes ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp . overall, these ores matched  <dig>  bess, covering  <dig>  bp and accounting for almost  <dig> % of the total bes length. extrapolating to the level of the oak genome, there could be as many as  <dig>  copies of the most frequent ore. similarly, four other ores may be present more than  <dig>  times. thus, in addition to the repetitive dna fraction identified by classical analysis , the  <dig> ores and  <dig> repeat sequences bring the total repetitive dna content to a minimum of  <dig> %.

simple sequence repeats 
in total,  <dig>  ssrs with a motif length of between two and six nucleotides were detected among the oak bess corresponding to one ssr per  <dig>  kb  of genomic sequence. this frequency was found to be higher than in other plant species . dinucleotide motifs were the most abundant , followed by penta- , tri- , tetra-  and hexa-nucleotide motifs  . the most abundant dinucleotide ssr motifs in oak bess were at/ta  and ag/ga/tc/ct  . no gc motifs were found. dinucleotide motifs were also the most abundant motifs in other species, such as carita papaya  and prunus persica , followed by penta- and tri-nucleotide motifs  and, finally tetra- and hexa-nucleotide motifs. conversely, for other species, approximately equal proportions of di-, tri- and pentanucleotide motifs were found . in addition, the ssr motif content of oak was found to be significantly different from that of other species . in the oak unigene dataset  <cit> , di- and trinucleotide motifs were the most frequent  followed by tetra-  and hexanucleotide motifs . trinucleotide ssrs  were twice as frequent as in the unigene set. the enrichment of trinucleotide ssrs in ests is consistent with previous reports of ssr abundance in the gene space .

gene content
once repeats were masked,  <dig>  bess  were found to match at least one a. thaliana sequence in the nr database. we found that  <dig> % and  <dig> % of these  <dig>  bess were homologous to cp and mt sequences, respectively. a total of  <dig>  masked bess  matched at least one a. thaliana sequence in the swissprot database  ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of which matched a chloroplast- or mitochondrion-encoded protein sequence, respectively. the number of cp hits was in the range of chloroplast contamination estimated by pcr . we found that  <dig>  bess matched an a. thaliana sequence in both the nr and swissprot databases, including  <dig> %  of cp and  <dig> %  of mt sequences. we found that  <dig>  masked bess  matched at least one oak est sequence in the oak unigene dataset , and among these sequences, we identified  <dig> % of cp and  <dig> % of mt protein-coding sequences. among these  <dig>  bess,  <dig>   also matched at least one sequence in swissprot, nr or both databases .

based on the number of bess matching at least one a. thaliana sequence in the swissprot database , the mean sequence length of the bes , the size of the oak genome , the total size of the bess  and the mean size of a gene , we estimated a number of  <dig>  genes. bioinformatics' analysis on oak unigene set revealed that 11% of them have no homology with genes in arabidopsis  <cit> , taking into account this result we estimated the gene content of the whole genome of at least  <dig> genes. this estimated number of genes is consistent with the gene number for a fully sequenced plant genome.

functional annotation
among the  <dig>  oak bess significantly aligned with a. thaliana sequences in swissprot,  <dig> bess were associated with at least one go term . a total of  <dig> go terms were assigned to these  <dig> oak bess on the basis of matches in the pfam database:  <dig> bess were annotated with at least one of the  <dig> terms of the biological process category,  <dig> were annotated with at least one of the  <dig> terms of the molecular function category and  <dig> were annotated with at least one of the  <dig> terms of the cellular component category . most terms occurred at relatively low frequency. only  <dig> of the  <dig> go terms assigned to the bess occurred ten or more times in this dataset. a large proportion of the  <dig>  assignments to the molecular function category were associated with the binding  and catalytic activity  categories . most of the  <dig> assignments to the biological process category concerned the metabolic process , cellular process  and localization  categories .

within these two categories -- molecular function  and biological process  -- the distribution of the functional annotations of our bess differed significantly from the global gene ontology database. indeed, a chi <dig> test  showed that the metabolic process, cellular process, biological regulation, response to stimulus, signaling and molecular transducer activity categories were significantly underrepresented in our dataset. by contrast, the localization category was twice as frequent.

comparative genome mapping
we found that  <dig> of the  <dig>  oak bess that were compared with the v. vinifera genome presented at least one match. these matches were divided into seven categories, as shown in the last seven columns of additional file  <dig>  the 'single end' category corresponds to bac end pairs for which only one of the two sequences matched a sequence in the v. vinifera genome most of the matches  were of this type. twenty bes pairs for which bess from the same bac matched the v. vinifera genome  were assigned to the 'paired-end' category. the 'colocalized' category contained eight bac end pairs that matched the same v. vinifera chromosome. the distance between the paired matches for seven of these eight bes pairs was either smaller than  <dig> kb or larger than  <dig> kb . for one of the eight bes pairs,  <dig> hits were detected with the v. vinifera genome and all of these intertwined alignments fell into the 'no-gapped' category for chromosome  <dig> of v. vinifera. the last two categories corresponded to bacs for which both end sequences matched the genome, at points  <dig> to  <dig> kb apart on the v. vinifera and p. trichocarpa genome, either in the correct orientation with respect to each other  or rearranged with respect to each other . one of the eight bes pairs matching the same v. vinifera chromosome fell into the 'collinear' category, suggesting the presence of one putative microsyntenic region between oak and chromosome  <dig> of v. vinifera. this region contains the gsvivg <dig> gene  <cit> , which encodes an alcohol acyl transferase protein very similar to that encoded by the lupinus albus q5h873_lupal gene and involved in competition with other plant species and in the synthesis of defense compounds active against pathogenic organisms  <cit> . the sequence of the protein encoded by gsvivg <dig> matched  <dig> sequences in the oak unigene set  <cit> , all classified as having go: <dig> transferase activity, transferring acyl groups other than amino-acyl groups in the gene ontology classification.

only three pairs of the bess mapped to the p. trichocarpa genome . for two of these pairs of bess, both bess matched the same chromosome. however, none of the oak bess matched to points in the p. trichocarpa genome within  <dig> to  <dig> kb of each other.

 <dig> pair = bes pair

 <dig> alig. = significant alignment

we repeated this analysis for the a. thaliana genome. for the  <dig> bes pairs identified as 'co-localized', both ends matched to the chloroplast molecule  .

in similar investigations in the a. thaliana genome, datema et al.  <cit> , identified very few regions of microsynteny in potato  and tomato . tomato displayed a higher degree of synteny with p. trichocarpa, with  <dig> collinear sequences and  <dig> rearranged sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
we constructed the first genomic bac library for the genus quercus. it was built for a genotype involved in controlled crosses for genetic mapping and qtl detection. the estimated genome coverage of  <dig> × was confirmed by pcr screening of  <dig> genetic markers evenly distributed over the genetic linkage map. both genome coverage and the mean insert size of  <dig> kb make this library useful for physical mapping and map-based cloning approaches for adaptive trait qtls and genome sequencing. we carried out a preliminary examination of the composition of the genome sequence by generating  <dig>  bess and searching for sequence similarities. the sequences contained a relatively small proportion of the known repetitive dna sequences . however,  <dig> % of the bess constituted new repeat sequences. protein-coding regions accounted for  <dig> % of the bess. only  <dig> and  <dig> matches were found between oak and grapevine or oak and poplar respectively, suggesting that studies of the oak genome will provide new insight into the organization and function of plant genomes.
