BACKGROUND
the transcription factor gata- <dig>  which is expressed during the earliest stages of hematopoiesis, is essential for early hematopoietic development; gata-2-/- mice have severe anemia and are deficient in the proliferation and survival of multipotent hematopoietic progenitors  <cit> . given the essential nature of gata- <dig>  the factors required for its hematopoietic expression are likely to play an important role in the initial stages of hematopoietic development. although a few growth factors that affect gata- <dig> expression are known  <cit> , little is understood about the regulation of gata- <dig> in hematopoietic tissues. recent studies showed that oct- <dig>  gata, and evi <dig> factors and their binding sites were involved in regulating gata- <dig> hematopoietic expression  <cit> . however, these binding sites are located in the proximal region of the promoter and are unlikely sufficient in directing hematopoietic expression of gata- <dig> since several lines of evidence have shown that the regulatory elements required for gata- <dig> hematopoietic expression are located many kilobase pairs  upstream of gata- <dig>  <cit> . in fact, to fully rescue hematopoietic development in gata-2-/-mice, constructs containing over one hundred kbp of genomic sequence are required  <cit> .

we have previously utilized bacterial artificial chromosomes , which can accommodate inserts containing several hundred kbp of genomic dna <cit> , to study regulation of gata- <dig> in hematopoietic cells. once a genomic fragment has been cloned into a bac, it can be modified by insertion of a reporter gene <cit> . using multiple gfp reporter modified bac clones, containing varied amounts of upstream and downstream genomic sequence, we have demarcated a distal genomic region that regulates hematopoietic gata- <dig> expression in transgenic zebrafish  <cit> .

in this report, we describe the identification and functional studies of two highly conserved non-coding sequence elements within this genomic region. using tol <dig> transposon cassettes containing these non-coding sequence elements linked to gfp, we have identified a  <dig> bps cis-acting element that is sufficient to drive reporter gene expression in a manner that recapitulates hematopoietic gata- <dig> expression pattern in a stable transgenic zebrafish line. in addition, deleting this element from the modified bac clone eliminates hematopoietic gfp expression. further analysis by base change mutations coupled with transgenic analysis we demonstrated that the hoxa <dig> and lmo <dig> play critical roles in regulating gata- <dig> hematopoietic expression.

RESULTS
comparative genomics analysis
the expression patterns of gata- <dig> in hematopoietic and neuronal tissues are conserved in vertebrates, suggesting that the arrangement and sequence of the gata- <dig> genomic locus may be highly conserved. comparative analyses of a <dig> kbp sequence spanning the zebrafish gata- <dig> locus and approximately  <dig> kbp sequences of gata- <dig> from human, mouse and rat and  <dig> kb genomic sequence flanking the fugu gata- <dig> locus has revealed a conserved syntenic relationship of gata- <dig> with rpn <dig> . a similar arrangement of general exon and intron structures and high sequence homology in exons has also been observed in the genomes of the five species . in addition, we have identified highly conserved non-coding sequences in the genomicregion flanking gata- <dig> . we identified two conserved non-coding sequences, one at ~ <dig> and the other ~ <dig> kbp upstream of zebrafish gata- <dig> start codon . these sequences are located in approximately the same location in human, mouse, and rat, but in fugu are located closer to the gata- <dig> coding sequence . a conserved non-coding sequence was also found downstream of gata- <dig> in fugu, mouse, rat, human and zebrafish genomes .

the conserved sequence located between12892- <dig> bp upstream of the zebrafish gata- <dig> start codon  is  <dig> bp. zebrafish up <dig> sequence has an 81% sequence identity with human up <dig> sequence, an 80% sequence identity with both mouse and rat up1sequences and an 83% sequence identity with that of fugu . a conserved sequence located 9887– <dig> bp upstream of the gata- <dig> start codon  is  <dig> bp. zebrafish up <dig> sequence has a 74%, 72%, 72% and 94% sequence identity with up <dig> sequences from human, mouse, rat and fugu genomes, respectively .

an alternative first exon  has been found in the gata- <dig> genomic sequences of human, rodents and chick  <cit> . in mouse genome, the conserved up <dig> region  is located at about  <dig> kb 5' upstream of is, which is approximately  <dig>  kb further upstream of the general exon ig of gata- <dig> gene. to determine if alternative first exons also exist in zebrafish, 5' race was performed using mrna from zebrafish embryos at the stages of 22~ <dig> somites. as shown in supplementary figure s <dig> , only one pcr band was amplified, indicating that there is no alternative transcriptional product. this finding is consistent with the data from analyzing gata- <dig> mrna of 75% epiboly stage zebrafish embryos reported by oren et al  <cit> . although zebrafish is different, the genomic arrangement of is among human, rodent and chick genomes are conserved.

functional analysis of the putative regulatory elements of gata- <dig> gene in zebrafish
as noted, during zebrafish embryogenesis, gata- <dig> is expressed in the embryonic hematopoietic tissue intermediate cell mass  and in neuronal cells . icm specific gene expression of gata- <dig> can be recapitulated in transgenic zebrafish embryos carrying a gfp-modified bac construct that includes  <dig> kb genomic sequence upstream of and adjacent to the gata- <dig> start codon  <cit> . in contrast, gfp expression was not observed in the icm of transgenic zebrafish embryos carrying constructs containing only  <dig>  kbp of upstream sequence, although strong gfp expression was seen in neuronal cells in these embryos . these results indicate that a hematopoietic regulatory element is located between  <dig>  and  <dig> kbp upstream of the zebrafish gata- <dig> start codon.

to determine whether conserved non-coding sequences located in this region, up <dig> or up <dig> are necessary, alone or in combination, to drive hematopoietic expression, we generated germline stable transgenic zebrafish carrying modified bac constructs having deletions of up <dig> or up <dig> or both. in progeny of transgenic zebrafish harboring bacΔup1/gfp, strong fluorescent expression was observed in the icm region at  <dig> hpf . gfp expression was stronger in embryos carrying bacΔup1/gfp than in transgenic zebrafish embryos carrying bac/gfp . gfp expression was not observed in the icm of embryos carrying bacΔup2/gfp  or bacΔup1Δup2/gfp ; however, gfp expression in neuronal cells was not affected in these embryos .

to determine whether these elements are sufficient, alone or in combination, to induce hematopoietic expression, gfp reporter gene constructs that contained up <dig> or up <dig> or both  were used to generate transgenic zebrafish. the conserved non-coding sequences found  <dig>  kb and  <dig> kb, respectively, upstream of the gata- <dig> start codon were inserted into tol2-transposon cassettes proximal to a gata- <dig> minimal promoter/gfp fusion generating a series of construct combinations . these constructs were flanked by the tol <dig> cis-acting elements, which are required for genome integration of the construct. each cassette was microinjected into fertilized eggs containing maternally expressed tol <dig> transposase. tol2-transposon mediated germline transmission of a gata- <dig> minimal promoter/gfp reporter gene fusion  or of constructs with up <dig>  and/or up <dig>  inserts  was determined by pcr. this approach, which typically produces at least 40% germline transgenic zebrafish, resulted in multiple stable transgenic zebrafish lines for each construct analyzed.

in zebrafish transgenic embryos carrying the up1-mp/gfp construct  , no icm-specific expression was observed; however, strong fluorescence was detected in the heart at  <dig> hpf . in progeny of three independent transgenic zebrafish lines carrying up2-mp/gfp, fluorescent expression was observed in blastoderm cells at 80% epiboly . at  <dig> hpf, in the same transgenic lines, strong gfp expression was seen in the icm, and weakly in the spinal cord . the icm expression pattern of up2-mp/gfp correlates well with gata- <dig> expression pattern determined by in situ hybridization . two up <dig> fragments  were also analyzed for the ability to drive hematopoietic expression in transgenic zebrafish. in four independent transgenic zebrafish lines, we found that up2a can drive gfp expression in the icm although less fluorescence was observed than in the up <dig> transgenic and up2a transgenic zebrafish embryos also had non-specific gfp expression in the notochord . we also obtained several lines of transgenic zebrafish carrying a gfp expression vector in which both non-coding sequence elements were linked to gata- <dig> minimal promoter ; gfp expression in the icm and the heart was observed at  <dig> hpf . gfp expression was undetectable in five independent transgenic zebrafish lines carrying gata- <dig> minimal promoter construct .

conservation of the non-coding sequence, up <dig>  in five vertebrate species suggests functional conservation. to determine whether this enhancer element is active in mammalian hematopoietic cells, we performed transient transfection assays with a construct containing up <dig>  we transfected two human myeloid leukemia cell lines  and a non-hematopoietic mammalian cell line nih 3t <dig>  with the mp/gfp, up2-mp/gfp and the up2a-mp/gfp constructs along with a cmv β-galactosidase plasmid to normalize for transfection efficiency. in myeloid cell lines, we observed increased gfp expression and this activity was stronger with the entire up <dig> compared to activity of the minimal promoter . transfection with the up2a element also showed increased gfp expression but this activity was less than that of the up <dig>  in both cases, the differences were found to be statistically significant when compared to the minimal promoter . no gfp expression was observed in nih3t <dig> cells; β-galactosidase expression was observed in this cell line indicating that up <dig> and up2a enhancer activities are specific to hematopoietic cells. finally, we generated a reporter construct containing the mouse up <dig> linked to gfp and analyzed its activity in transient transgenic zebrafish assays. as shown in supplementary table s , mouse and zebrafish up <dig> showed a similar enhancer activity to direct hematopoietic expression of gfp.

analysis of binding sites for potential transacting factors
transfac <dig>  match and p-match were used to search databases <cit>  for potential transcription factor binding sites involved in gata- <dig> hematopoietic expression directed by up <dig> sequence. multiple transcription factor binding sites including those for aml1a, gata- <dig>  gata- <dig>  en- <dig>  fac <dig>  hnf- <dig>  e2f- <dig>  lmo <dig>  arp- <dig> and hoxa <dig> were identified. constructs carrying mutations on the binding sites for transcription factor aml- <dig>  e2f- <dig>  arp- <dig>  lmo <dig> and hoxa <dig> were generated and injected into zebrafish embryo for transient assays of hematopoietic gfp expression. under a condition that is statistically significant,  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the embryos injected with construct carrying mutation in e2f- <dig>  lmo <dig> and hoxa3-a binding site, respectively, showed transient hematopoietic gfp expression . these percentages are significantly lower than that of embryos injected with the control up <dig> construct . other constructs did not show any significant differences .

emsa showed that, in vitro, proteins of transcription factors e2f- <dig> and hoxa <dig> specifically formed the protein-dna complexes with the probes containing lmo <dig> and hoxa3-a binding sites present in up <dig>  respectively . with the anti-e2f- <dig> antibody, a super shift was observed while there was no super shift with a non-specific antibody. the shifted band was not observed with the probes containing a mutation in the e2f- <dig> and hoxa3-a binding site, respectively.

the function of e2f- <dig>  lmo <dig> and hoxa <dig> binding sites were further analyzed in the germline transgenic zebrafish embryos carrying the described base change mutations in the same up2-mp/gfp construct context. a base change mutation in e2f- <dig> binding site showed increased non-specific expression in muscle and notochord  and less severe but notably reduced expression in hematopoietic cells. mutation within lmo <dig> and hoxa3-a binding sites resulted in almost elimination of gfp expression in hematopoietic cells, showing a mosaic gfp positive pattern in less than 10% of hematopoietic cells compared to up2-mp/gfp wild type construct . as a control, mutation within the arp- <dig> binding site showed no effect on gfp expression . these results revealed that integrity of these putative lmo <dig> and hoxa3-a binding sites is required for proper regulation of gata-2/gfp expression in hematopoietic cells.

discussion
due to important roles of gata- <dig> in hematopoiesis  <cit> , a number of previous studies have been carried out to analyze the cis-acting elements and transcription factors that regulate hematopoietic gata- <dig> expression. transcription factors gatas, oct <dig> and evi <dig>  <cit>  and distal cis-acting dna sequence elements appear involved in regulating its hematopoietic expression as revealed by transgenic animal studies  <cit> . the evolutionary conservation of non-coding sequences indicates that they have important biological functions, including developmental regulation of gene expression  <cit> . we used comparative genomics to identify three highly conserved non-coding sequences in the genomic regions flanking gata- <dig> in the fugu, mouse, rat, human, and zebrafish genomes. one conserved element is located downstream, and two others, up  <dig> and up <dig>  are located upstream of gata- <dig> in a genomic region that, we showed in previous studies <cit> , is required for hematopoietic expression of gata- <dig> in transgenic zebrafish. in this study we show that up <dig> specifically directs gfp reporter gene expression in heart and up <dig> is required for hematopoietic regulation of gata- <dig>  the enhancer activity of up <dig> in heart should represent an authentic activity since gata- <dig> is expressed in the mouse heart  <cit>  as well as weakly expressed in embryonic zebrafish heart as detected by whole mount mrna in situ hybridization .

transgenic zebrafish carrying the up2-mp/gfp construct expressed gfp strongly in hematopoietic tissues, showing that up <dig> is sufficient to drive hematopoietic-specific gene expression. in addition, bac clones having a deletion of up <dig> did not drive hematopoietic gene expression whereas deletion of up <dig> had no impact on hematopoietic gene expression, suggesting that up <dig> is also necessary for regulating gata- <dig> expression in hematopoietic tissues. in transfection analyses, we also found that hematopoietic up <dig> enhancer activity is conserved in mammalian cells. similarly, mouse up <dig> enhancer has directed higher expression in zebrafish hematopoietic cells as shown by transient assays , suggesting that function of up <dig> is conserved between zebrafish and mammals. the tissue-specific expression in zebrafish appears to require elements that repress gene expression since deleting up2b results non-specific expression of gfp in notochord . interestingly, we have also observed this in the regulation of the zebrafish gata- <dig> gene  <cit> .

up <dig> contains several known consensus binding sites including those for aml1a, gata- <dig>  gata- <dig>  en- <dig>  fac <dig>  hnf- <dig>  e2f- <dig>  lmo <dig> and hoxa <dig>  among these factors, hoxa <dig>  aml1a, e2f- <dig>  arp- <dig>  lmo <dig> and gata-1/ <dig> are likely to be involved in regulating hematopoietic gata- <dig> expression since expression of the others has not been observed in hematopoietic tissues. several hox genes have recently been shown to be necessary for cdx4-mediated specification of hematopoietic cell fate during vertebrate embryogenesis <cit> . since specification of hematopoietic cell fate precedes hematopoietic gata- <dig> expression, hoxa proteins are good candidates for gata- <dig> regulation. e2f- <dig> and aml1a are also potential regulators of hematopoietic gata- <dig> expression. e2f- <dig> mouse mutants have defects in hematopoietic progenitor cells that result from impeded cell cycle progression <cit> . aml <dig>  also known as runx <dig>  contributes to both transcriptional activation and repression in cell type-specific hematopoietic gene expression; aml <dig> knock-out mice lack fetal liver-derived hematopoietic cell clusters  <cit> . furthermore, associated with chromosomal translocation, aml <dig> is involved in several types of acute myeloid leukemia <cit> . arp- <dig> is a regulator of gene switching from embryonic to fetal globins <cit> . lmo <dig> forms transcription factor complexes with scl and gata factors in erythroid and hematopoietic progenitor cells <cit> . gata transcription factor binding sites found in up <dig> may be involved in auto-regulation of gata- <dig> expression by gata- <dig> <cit>  or trans-regulation by other gata factors. gata- <dig> and gata- <dig> double knockdown in zebrafish did not eliminate initial expression of gata- <dig> <cit>  . similarly, gata- <dig> promoter driven gfp expression were not affected in gata-2-/- or gata-3-/- null mouse embryos  <cit> . we therefore focused on analyzing function of binding sites for other non-gata factors within up <dig>  from the transgenic embryos injected with a series of site-specific mutagenesis constructs of other potential transcription binding sites contained in up <dig>  we demonstrated that the mutations in putative e2f- <dig>  lmo <dig> and hoxa3-a binding sites decreased hematopoietic gfp expression. there are two high affinity hoxa <dig> binding sites in up <dig> region. mutation of the hoxa3-b binding site did not affect the hematopoietic expression of the gfp reporter gene, neither in transient nor in transgenic zebrafish embryos. interestingly, this hoxa3-b site is not conserved from zebrafish to mammals. thus, we consider the hoxa3-a binding site is the conserved functional site. although mutations in the lmo <dig>  e2f- <dig> and hoxa3-a binding sites all affect gfp expression in hematopoietic cells, lmo <dig> and hoxa <dig> sites appear playing a bigger role in positive regulation of gata- <dig> whereas e2f <dig> site is more involved in restricting gata- <dig> from expression in non-hematopoietic cells. further analysis of their corresponding transcription factors by genetic and molecular approaches may lead to a better understanding of mechanisms underlying gata- <dig> expression in hematopoietic cells.

up <dig> is located near at  <dig> kb 5' of start codon in both the zebrafish and mouse gata- <dig> gene. previously, kobayashi-osaki et al. showed that a  <dig> base genomic sequence element located immediately 5' upstream of the conserved mouse up <dig> is essential for embryonic hematopoietic expression of gata-2/gfp in mouse  <cit> . in addition, five of six gata binding sites scattered in a genomic region of  <dig> bp, which encompass the up <dig> element, are critical for gata-2/gfp expression in transgenic mouse. these observations, in addition to implicating roles of gata factors in regulating hematopoietic gata- <dig> expression, conceivably validate the necessary function of up <dig> in mouse. however, since expression of gata-2/gfp is not affected in either gata-2-/- or gata-3-/- null mouse mutant as well as gata- <dig> expression is not affected when both gata- <dig> and gata- <dig> are down regulated in zebrafish, other factors may play more essential roles in initiating embryonic gata- <dig> hematopoietic expression. our studies suggest that factors binding to putative hoxa <dig>  lmo <dig> and e2f <dig> binding sites may be good candidates for such function. it is worth noting that the core sequence of hoxa <dig>  lmo <dig> and gata binding sites share high sequence similarity. therefore the true identity of transcription factors binding to these sites in vivo remains as a subject of further investigation. finally, mouse transgenic analysis suggests that a putative necessary enhancer for complete hematopoietic expression is located between 100– <dig> kb 5' of gata- <dig>  <cit> . it would be interesting to determine in transgenic mouse if up <dig> is also necessary by deletion analysis of bac or yac constructs. if yes, it would suggest that mouse needs additional enhancer located even further away to facilitate function of up <dig> element in directing hematopoietic expression of gata- <dig>  gata- <dig> regulation in mouse and zebrafish may certain differences reflecting evolutional divergence between the two species. nonetheless, up <dig> is conserved in sequence and genomic location and is functionally important in zebrafish.

although we focus on analyzing regulation of gata- <dig> gene expression the approach described here, drawing on embryological, genetic, molecular and computational methods, is generally applicable for rapidly identifying functional distal cis-acting sequences that regulate embryonic gene expression in vertebrates. in particular, we have established a transgenic line that expresses tol <dig> transposase in germ cells, providing the transposase maternally eliminates the need to co-inject transposase mrna. this simplified tol <dig> transposon-mediated transgenesis approach allows generation of multiple stable transgenic zebrafish lines with non-mosaic expression of the gfp reporter gene. this study and a recent report by fisher et al  <cit>  showed that tol <dig> transposon vectors are extremely useful for analyses of promoter and enhancer activity in zebrafish.

CONCLUSIONS
a highly conserved  <dig> bp non-coding sequence  located approximately  <dig> kb 5' upstream of the zebrafish gata- <dig> is necessary and sufficient to direct hematopoietic expression of gfp reporter gene. within up <dig> element, binding sites for transacting factors hoxa <dig> and lmo <dig> appear important for its enhancer activity. sequence similarity of up <dig> among zebrafish, mouse and human genomes suggests function conservation.
