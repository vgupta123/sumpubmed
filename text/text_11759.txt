BACKGROUND
the global importance of cattle production has resulted in considerable efforts to detect the genes controlling variations in economically important traits. this task is greatly facilitated by the availability of molecular markers ordered along chromosomes. in the last decade a number the bovine genome maps have been published, many of them based on genetic linkage between markers  <cit> . a major disadvantage of linkage maps is that only polymorphic loci can be included, whereas, rh maps can be constructed using sequence information from non-polymorphic loci. therefore, rh maps potentially contain more coding loci than linkage maps facilitating comparative mapping across species. in contrast to linkage maps, which exploit the frequency of natural recombination between markers to calculate distances and orders of markers, rh maps are constructed using the probability of breaks between markers induced by radiation. several whole genome radiation hybrid  panels are available for cattle that have been used to construct rh maps  <cit> . these rh maps have been used to create comparative maps between bovine and human chromosomes through the alignment of the loci derived from coding sequences  <cit> . the rh maps can also be integrated with other bovine physical maps such as bac maps constructed by fingerprinting methods by identifying the marker loci within e.g. bac end sequences  <cit> . this additional mapping information facilitates the ordering of fingerprint contigs and the construction of physical bac maps covering whole chromosomes. such physical bac maps provide a valuable starting point for genome sequencing  <cit> . fingerprint contig bac maps have been constructed for cattle using clones from the inra bac library  <cit>  and the chori- <dig> bac library  <cit> . the ultimate map for a species is the correctly assembled genome sequence. the bovine genome sequencing project started in  <dig> and uses a combination of whole genome shotgun sequences  and sample sequencing of a minimum tiling path of bac clones spanning the genome. the current, publicly available, bovine genomic sequence  has 6-fold genome coverage from wgs assembled into scaffolds and aligned on the chromosomes using limited mapping data. the use of rh and linkage map information  <cit>  would greatly improve the genome sequence assembly  <cit> .

here we report a second generation rh map of the bovine genome which can be used to improve the construction of an integrated bovine genomic map. sequences of the markers used to construct the map were aligned with the marc  <dig> linkage map and the illinois-texas  rh map  <cit>  to investigate discrepancies. loci that were unambiguously placed in all the maps were then aligned with the btau_ <dig>  sequence to identify potential problems in the current sequence assembly.

RESULTS
radiation hybrid map
 <dig> markers were added to those on the first-generation rh map of williams et al.  <cit> , of which  <dig> are newly mapped loci and  <dig> are previously reported aflp markers  <cit> , giving a final total of  <dig> markers . the majority of the new markers,  <dig>  are within genes,  <dig> are microsatellite loci,  <dig> aflp markers,  <dig> bac end sequences and  <dig> are from ests sequences that do not show convincing similarity to the annotated bovine sequence. the rh chromosome maps constructed from this data can be viewed and information downloaded from the arkdb database  <cit> .

the total length of the whole genome rh map, including all bovine autosomes and the x chromosome is  <dig> rays . the map of bta  <dig> is the shortest at  <dig> cr and the longest is bta  <dig> . the average marker interval, over the whole genome, is  <dig> cr ranging between  <dig> cr  to  <dig> cr . distance comparisons between common markers on the rh map, marc  <dig> linkage map and the bovine sequence suggests, on average,  <dig> cr on the bovgen rh map is equivalent to  <dig>  cm and  <dig> kbp, respectively, although this varies considerably across the genome.

comparison with the iltx  <dig> rh map
there are  <dig> marker loci in common between the bovgen rh map described here and the illinois-texas  rh map  <cit> . all of these common loci were assigned to the same chromosomes on both maps .

three chromosomes  cannot be assessed for consistency of their order between the iltx  <dig> and bovgen rh map because they have no markers in common. for the remaining  <dig> chromosomes,  <dig> are consistent with the bovgen rh map. for example, the bovgen rh map of chromosome  <dig> has  <dig> markers in common with the iltx  <dig> map and the order agrees between maps . out of the  <dig> chromosomes another  <dig> have one marker out of  <dig> to  <dig> corresponding loci inconsistently positioned. on bta  <dig> there are marker order discrepancies between the maps involving  <dig> out of the  <dig> corresponding markers.

comparison with marc  <dig> linkage map
there are  <dig> marker loci in common between the bovgen rh and the marc  <dig> linkage map  <cit>  which allows a detailed comparison of map order and chromosome assignment. inconsistencies in chromosomal assignment are found for  <dig> of these  <dig> loci . in all these cases only individual markers are involved.

the marker order on  <dig> chromosomes  is in very close agreement between the bovgen rh and marc  <dig> maps. for example, the order of the  <dig> markers on bta  <dig> that are in common show only minor inversions of two pairs of linked loci: bms <dig> and maf <dig> appear in different order and bms <dig> is located telomeric to bms <dig> and bms <dig> on the bovgen rh map, but centromeric on the marc  <dig> genetic map . despite the similarity the marker order as suggested by the marc  <dig> map is inconsistent with the multipoint map bovgen rh data. if the rh data is forced into the order of the marc  <dig> map a much lower probability for the map is obtained. thus, in order to determine the true order of these markers additional information is required.

on a further  <dig> chromosomes, minor discrepancies between these maps were observed. on bta  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and x the order of markers is essentially the same, but with a number of individual markers at different positions. for bta  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> differences were observed involving the orientation of groups of markers, but with a conserved order of markers within the group. for example, on bta  <dig> the marker order is in general consistent between the bovgen rh and the marc  <dig> linkage map, however two small groups of linked markers 26_a  and 26_b  have the same marker order in both maps, but are inverted with only one marker  at a divergent position .

on four chromosomes major inconsistencies are observed where groups of linked markers map to different chromosomal positions  or where the order of markers differs within several marker groups . on bta  <dig>  for example, the position of two groups of linked markers 7_a  and 7_b  are exchanged. in addition the group 7_a is in a different orientation in both maps, while the marker order in 7_b is inconsistent . nevertheless, these discrepancies only involve about a quarter of the chromosome, and  <dig> out of the  <dig> common markers. the map positions of the other  <dig> markers are in close agreement between the two maps. these differences could be further investigated by comparison with additional mapping information .

comparison with the 6Ã— bovine assembly
of the  <dig> markers successfully included in the rh map,  <dig> could be unequivocally assigned to a position in the btau_ <dig>  bovine sequence,  <dig> were assigned to the same chromosome, but  <dig> mapped on different chromosomes between the bovgen rh map and the sequence . on seven chromosomes inconsistent assignments involving groups of three or more markers were observed .

on all but two chromosomes  there were many differences between the map order and the sequence: on many chromosomes large discrepancies involving groups of linked markers and/or large numbers of individual loci were seen, particularly on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  for example, on chromosome  <dig> two large groups of linked loci on the bovgen rh map locate to divergent positions in both the btau_ <dig>  and marc  <dig> map, however, these latter two maps agree. this inconsistency is similar to an inconsistency observed between the bovgen rh and the marc  <dig> map, resulting in a good agreement with the btau_ <dig>  sequence . further information from the iltx  <dig> map does not help to resolve this inconsistency as there is only one marker in common with the bovgen rh map in this region.

when markers that were at inconsistent positions between the bovgen rh and either the iltx  <dig> or marc  <dig> linkage map were removed,  <dig> common markers with the iltx  <dig> map and  <dig> common markers with the marc  <dig> linkage map remained. the mapping order of these markers was then compared with the order in the bovine sequence. the comparison with the btau_ <dig>  sequence still revealed discrepancies across the whole genome. for example, on bta  <dig> four markers which could be assigned to positions in the sequence assembly appeared to have inconsistent positions  when compared between the bovgen rh, the marc  <dig> and/or the iltx  <dig> map. after their removal the remaining corresponding markers are in close agreement between the three maps but still reveal inconsistencies with the sequence assembly . many of the markers which are in common between the bovgen rh map and btau_ <dig>  are not present in the marc  <dig> map. these markers tend to have a higher inconsistency when compared to the sequence assembly.

discussion
the ability to determine the order of close markers on genome maps differs between approaches, and all approaches, including the assembly of a whole genome sequence, are prone to errors. in some cases insufficient information is available to assign the correct order or positioning of loci, while data errors can introduce distortions in the maps. the ultimate genome map of a species is the correctly ordered dna sequence. achieving the correct sequence assembly uses several sources of information. sequence information from other species, including the human genome could be used as a template, but this approach should be treated with extreme caution as species specific variations are known  <cit> . therefore, direct sequence information is used for the local assembly of shotgun sequence reads into contigs, and these contigs are then assembled into scaffolds using additional information, such as overlapping clones, and sequences from paired clone ends. the ordering of these scaffolds on chromosomes and assembly of the final sequence relies on additional mapping information, including bac fingerprint contig maps, linkage maps and rh maps. in this paper we describe an rh map with almost  <dig> mapped loci which will contribute to the assembly of the bovine genome sequence.

comparison with other linkage and rh maps
the consistency in ordering of common loci can be assessed across different maps, however, it is important that the information used when assembling the maps is independent, as circular arguments can give a false measure of agreement. the approach of e.g. itoh et al.  <cit>  was to use the linkage map as template for their rh map; in contrast we did not use any prior information to construct the rh map presented here. this was because the aim was to assemble the most likely map using completely independent data and so not to propagate potential errors across different maps. resolving these inconsistencies often requires the use of additional independent evidence such as bac fpc mapping data or cytogenetic  information. we carried out an alignment of the bovgen rh map with the other available bovine genome maps and the btau_ <dig>  sequence assembly, but only after the rh maps had been constructed. while this approach relies on only one source of information it may not result in the "best" possible map, however, it avoids bias and the resulting independent map can then be used to develop a combined map which carries a measure of map confidence based on similarity and differences between maps.

the bovgen and iltx  <dig> rh map appear to be more consistent with each other than with the marc  <dig> linkage map. some inconsistencies between linkage and rh maps may be due to the different mapping approaches. however, the observation of the apparently higher consistency between the rh maps must be treated with care as the bovgen rh map has fewer loci in common with the iltx  <dig> map than with the marc  <dig> linkage map, and so fewer discrepancies could be detected. the iltx  <dig> map was constructed on the basis of the first-generation map  by increasing the marker density and a subsequent rigorous removal of markers which did not pass a quality control procedure  <cit> . in this process a significant number of markers common to both the bovgen rh and the iltx  <dig> map were removed and as a result there are fewer correspondences of our map with iltx  <dig> than with the old iltx  <dig>  it can be assumed that this process improved the iltx map enormously. therefore, we used the iltx  <dig> map for comparison despite fewer correspondences. nevertheless, the iltx  <dig> map has a similarly high marker order consistency and chromosomal assignment with the bovgen rh map .

comparison with the sequence assembly
sequence similarity search algorithms used to align maps with btau_ <dig>  have a considerable risk of errors as they may also detect gene duplications or similar motifs in different genes. to minimize this problem we used very stringent parameters for minimum homology and maximized the required length of overlap between sequences. in addition, sequence matches were assessed manually. thus the loci we aligned between the different maps and the bovine sequence carry a very high probability of correctly assigned homology. differences in the position of individual markers between different maps could be the result of technical variations explained by using different parameters and algorithms to construct the multipoint maps. inconsistencies in the chromosomal assignment of individual markers may also have simple explanations, such as poor primer design resulting in amplification of related loci and not the target locus. of greater importance for the interpretation of the map information are inconsistencies affecting whole groups of linked markers. to minimise the propagation of errors in individual maps we eliminated individual markers that were inconsistently placed between bovgen rh, iltx  <dig> and marc  <dig> maps from a further combined analysis against the sequence assembly.

while the bovgen rh map is in general agreement with the iltx map and the marc  <dig> map, there is poor agreement with the btau_ <dig>  sequence at specific chromosomal regions. in such regions, e.g. those described above on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the assembled btau_ <dig>  sequence is most consistent with the linkage map. this is not surprising, because, among other sources of information, the marc  <dig> map was used to order the sequence scaffolds in btau_ <dig> . recalculating the bovgen data for these chromosomes and forcing the markers into the order they appear in the sequence assembly significantly increases the map length and reduces the probability showing that our data are not consistent with the sequence order. further information must be generated to resolve such inconsistencies.

assignment of markers to different chromosomes
a problem in the genome assembly is that of erroneous assignments of sequence scaffolds. by comparing assignments among the different rh and linkage maps  <cit>  and also using comparative human  <cit>  or mouse  <cit>  information, it seems likely that the assignment in the bovine assembly is most often at fault . for example the markers ptk2b, bz <dig> and b4galt <dig>  are closely linked on the bovgen rh map of bta  <dig> and the linkage map of barendse et al.  <cit>  which also places these genes on bta  <dig>  this is also consistent with data from fiedorek & kay  <cit>  who mapped pyk2b  on murine chromosome  <dig> and inazawa et al.  <cit>  who mapped the gene on human chromosome  <dig> at positions which share conservation of synteny with bta  <dig>  <cit> . however, these marker loci are placed on chromosome  <dig> in the btau_ <dig>  sequence assembly. all three markers are located on a single sequence scaffold , suggesting that the chromosomal assignment of this scaffold is likely to be incorrect.

a group of neighbouring markers formed by kiaa <dig>  q9y4f <dig>  kns <dig> and btbd <dig> were assigned to bta  <dig> on the bovgen rh map; however, this assignment is not consistent with other mapping data . the human homologues of these loci are located on human chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that this group is correctly assigned in the btau_ <dig>  sequence to chromosome  <dig> and that in this case the bovgen rh assignment is incorrect. nevertheless, the linkage of this group to other markers on bta  <dig> is convincing with lod linkage values up to  <dig>  between the extreme marker kiaa <dig> and the neighbouring markers on the bovgen rh map. if this marker group is tested with the markers located on bta  <dig> using the bovgen rh datasets it shows no linkage. in the btau_ <dig>  assembly this marker group is at an extreme telomeric position which suggests that the statistical support for this assignment is weak. this chromosomal assignment may have been made on the expected position derived from the supposed conservation of synteny between human and cattle chromosomes and should be tested using independent evidence.

the markers bz <dig>  cc <dig> and cc <dig> are assigned to bta  <dig> on the bovgen rh map and to bta  <dig> in the btau_ <dig>  sequence assembly . these markers are derived from bac end sequences of clones from the chori- <dig> library and are not present on other maps. all these markers are assigned to the scaffold chr <dig>  and are in a chromosomal region of the assembly with a low density of corresponding markers. in contrast on the bovgen rh map, the markers in the same region are at a higher density. this suggests that these markers are more tightly linked on the bovgen rh map. no further information is available to resolve this inconsistency.

independent information is essential to produce the best maps of the bovine genome and to assemble the most accurate sequence. in addition to the rh mapping approach and linkage mapping that have been discussed here the refinement of the sequence should use additional sources of information such as bac fpc maps, comparative mapping, fluorescent in situ hybridization, and somatic cell hybrid mapping.

CONCLUSIONS
there is reasonable consistency between the rh map presented here, the marc  <dig> linkage map and the iltx  <dig> map. however, where the maps differed it is usually not possible to determine which order of markers is correct. manipulating the data to make the different maps match is not productive. when the major discrepancies are removed a number of inconsistencies with the btau_ <dig>  bovine sequence assembly still remain. using the various mapping information it is possible to identify potential errors in the assembly of the current bovine genome sequence which should be investigated further to aid the improvement of the next sequence build.

using the information presented here it will not be possible to reach a final version of the sequence. the btau_ <dig>  sequence assembly contains more than  <dig>  scaffolds of which only  <dig> are anchored to chromosomes using markers from the genetic map, and about half of the anchored scaffolds contain two mapped markers allowing them to be orientated. the data presented here will increase the number of scaffolds that can be assigned and orientated. nevertheless it will be necessary to use additional information such as fingerprinting or bac skim data and physical maps, such as fish based techniques, which in addition to comparative mapping data will help to finalize the assembly and yield a reliable sequence.
