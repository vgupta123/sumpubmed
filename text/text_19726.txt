BACKGROUND
proteomics is the large-scale identifying and quantifying all expressed proteins in biological samples. understanding protein expression, the structure and function of each protein and the interactions among them will facilitate the search of useful targets and biomarkers for pharmaceutical design. currently, mass spectrometry  is an indispensable tool for protein identification and quantification  <cit> . the typical procedures in proteomics include digestion of the protein mixture into peptides, peptide separation using multidimensional liquid chromatography , and finally ms for quantification and tandem mass spectrometry  for identification of proteins from which the peptides were derived  <cit> .

ion mobility-mass spectrometry , which combines the features of ion mobility spectrometry  and ms, separates and detects peptide ions on a millisecond time-scale  <cit> . a typical proteomics experimental setup using imms consists of five components: sample introduction, compound ionization, ion mobility separation, mass separation as well as peptide and protein ion detection  <cit> . firstly, peptides mixture is introduced into the imms system. all peptides are ionized by electrospray ionization . the ionized peptide ions are then subjected to a drift tube for separation based on the mobility of peptide ions. the separated peptide ions are further submitted to an ms, where peptide ions are separated by mass-to-charge ratio  and finally detected by a mass detector. although these five components all play essential roles in the process, ion mobility separation is crucial for its impact on the consequent mass analysis and peptide ion detection. ion mobility allows for the separation of peptide ions based on differing cross-sections and molecular charge. this advantage makes it possible for peptides with the same mass-to-charge  ratio to be discriminated by the difference of their cross-section-to-charge ratio. to achieve high confidence peptide identification, many researchers have enhanced peptide ion separation based on changing the ion mobility conditions such as employing different gases, altering electric field strengths, and adopting non-linear electric field gradients  <cit> . even though these efforts, attempting to change the experimental environment, can impact the observed results and improve the ability of imms instruments to separate peptides, they are time-consuming and may be difficult to reproduce with different instrumentation configurations.

ims separates peptide ions based on drift time that is determined by the collision cross-section of each peptide ion in a given experiment condition. a peptide ion's collision cross-section is related to the ion size and shape resulted from the peptide amino acid sequence and its chemical modifications. therefore, peptide ion drift time in ims is actually correlated to the peptide amino acid sequence. deciphering such inherent relation between the drift time of peptide ion and peptide sequence will significantly benefit not only the understanding of gas phase peptide chemistry, but also the identification of peptide and proteins in proteomics.

peptide selection, fractionation and separation on chromatographic columns may be modelled with various methods. we have developed an algorithm to predict the fractionation of peptides in strong anion exchange  chromatography using a pattern classification technique based on artificial neural network  method  <cit> . an ann has also been used to predict peptide separation in reversed phase  chromatography  <cit> . predicted peptide retention times have been applied to assist peptide identification  <cit> . like other chromatographic methods, imms separates peptides based on their chemical and physical properties that reflect the peptide amino acid sequence and associated chemical modifications. it has been reported that the measurement of peptide ion drift time using imms is very reproducible  <cit> . any two measurements of mobilities  recorded on the same instrument usually agree to within 1% relative uncertainty. measurements performed by different groups usually agree to within 2%  <cit> . the high reproducibility of ims measurements encouraged us to explore the possibility of predicting peptide ion drift time using commercial imms instrumentation. the predicted peptide ion drift time can be used to simulate peptide separation in imms and also can be used to enhance confidence in protein identifications.

in this paper, a computational method was proposed to predict peptide ion drift time in imms using an artificial neural networks  regression model. in seeking a general property to estimate drift time of peptide ions in imms, sequence-based information was first extracted from each peptide, including peptide molecular weight, sequence length and a two-dimensional sequence index. the two-dimensional sequence index has two parameters designed to reflect the peptide amino acid sequence information based on the ionization constant  values of  <dig> amino acids. thereafter, a 10-fold cross-validation strategy was employed for ann model training and testing using three datasets with different charge state assignments. the developed ann model was tested on a five-protein digest sample. the high prediction accuracy achieved in this work demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the prediction model.

RESULTS
in this study we used the peptides generated from tryptic digestion of  <dig> pure proteins for our model development and testing. the raw data obtained from the mass spectrometer were first processed using instrument control software  to determine the drift time of each peptide ion. peptide charge status was manually assigned based on the m/z spacing between isotopic peaks. peptide ion assignment was achieved using a peptide mass fingerprint approach in which peptide ion assignment thresholds of ± <dig>  da were used. we assigned  <dig> peptide ions to the  <dig> proteins. of these assigned peptide ions,  <dig> were singly charged,  <dig> were doubly charged and  <dig> were triply charged.

to evaluate our proposed method objectively, we randomly grouped the  <dig> pure proteins into two subsets, {p1} and {p2}, where {p1} contains  <dig> proteins while {p2} contains  <dig> proteins. all peptides digested from the protein subset {p1} were used as the training dataset for the ann model construction, training and cross-validation . the peptides digested from the protein subset {p2} were used for model generalization testing. the motivation of generalization testing is to verify the generalization capability of the trained ann model using a new dataset which was not used for the creation and training of the network. table  <dig> summarizes the numbers of  all peptide ions identified from the  <dig> proteins. we then grouped these peptides and corresponding drift times into three datasets, c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  based on peptide charge states. we have identified  <dig> peptide ions from the digests of protein subset {p1} and  <dig> peptide ions from protein subset {p2}.

ain the bracket, the former is the number of peptides in the protein subset {p1}, and the latter is the peptides in the protein subset {p2}.

in this study, we developed our ann regression models for the singly-, doubly-, and triply-charged peptide ions, respectively. during the ann model construction, we employed a 10-fold cross-validation strategy  <cit> . for each of the three datasets, we first equally partitioned the entire dataset into  <dig> subsets in a random manner. of the  <dig> subsets, a single subset was selected as validation data while the remaining  <dig> subsets were used to train the ann model. the peptide drift times of the validation data were then predicted based on the trained ann regression model. this process was repeated to ensure that every data subset was selected as the validation data for one time only. therefore,  <dig> experiments were implemented for each charge specific dataset. by doing so, the drift time of each peptide ion in a dataset was predicted exactly once. the advantage of this cross-validation method is that all observations are used for both training and validation. this provides reliable learning of our model from the original data.

for a neural network model, the hidden layer configuration is very important because it introduces a nonlinear relationship into the network and provides the network with its ability to generalization. the model created in this paper is a back-propagation neural network model with a single hidden layer as increasing the number of hidden layers cannot improve the results  <cit> . however, choosing the number of nodes in the hidden layer is difficult because there are no acceptable theories to deal with this problem. it is generally accepted that selecting more nodes for the hidden layer will enable the model to "learn" more from the training data and have more power and flexibility. however, too many hidden nodes will increase the risk of over-fitting and an incapability of generalization  <cit> . therefore, a balance between the learning ability and the generalization of the model must be investigated. because of the complexity of the current problem and the number of nodes in the input and output layers, we first established a single-node hidden layer, and then the number of nodes in this hidden layer was increased iteratively by adding a single node in each iteration. we then chose an optimal number of the hidden layer nodes based on prediction results.

we employed the 10-fold cross-validation to find the optimal number of hidden layer nodes for our ann model. the analysis was performed separately on each of the three charge-specific datasets, i.e., c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  to a certain number of hidden layer nodes, we implemented the ann regression model ten times. table  <dig> shows the integrative performance of these repeated experiments under a prediction variation threshold of 15%. here, prediction variation threshold was defined as the relative variation of the predicted peptide ion drift time from the experimentally observed drift time:   

athe performance values consist of two measurements. one is the integrative prediction accuracy of five repeat experiments based on the variation threshold, and the other is the standard deviation of those accuracies.

where ηpred is the prediction variation, tpred is the predicted peptide ion drift time and texp is the experimentally observed peptide ion drift time.

after determining the optimal three-node hidden layer, we used 10-fold cross validation to study the performance of our proposed ann regression model on the training dataset. figure  <dig> displays the relation between fractions of peptides with a correct prediction of drift time for the threshold of ann prediction variation. our proposed ann regression model performs best on the singly-charged dataset. with 10% of prediction variation threshold, the ann regression model correctly predicted the drift time of  <dig> % of the singly-charged peptide ions. the fraction of correct prediction increases to  <dig> % when the prediction variation threshold is set at 15%. the performance of the proposed ann regression model on the doubly-charged peptide ions is close to its performance for the singly-charged peptide ions.

the performance of our model on the triply-charged peptide ions is relatively poor. with 15% prediction variation threshold, the ann model can only correctly predict the drift time of 74% of the triply-charged peptide ions. the prediction accuracy increases to 95% if the prediction variation is set to 27%. we believe there are three reasons for such poor prediction accuracy of the triply-charged peptide ions. one is that the volume of the training dataset is not sufficient to obtain a reliable model. the training dataset contains only  <dig> triply-charged peptide ions, while there are  <dig> singly-charged peptide ions and  <dig> doubly-charged peptide ions. the other reason is that the four peptide features extracted from the peptide sequence do not include peptide conformation information. in general, the triply-charged peptides are large peptides. for example, the average peptide molecular weight of the triply-charged peptides in the training data is  <dig>  da and the average peptide sequence length is  <dig>  amino acid residues . such large peptides usually form secondary structure, which will contribute to the peptide's cross-section and therefore, affect the peptide ion's drift time. additionally, the larger coulomb force experienced by the triply-charged peptide ions may cause a larger range in overall cross-section differences; that is, many more species  may adopt elongated conformations in order to minimize coulomb repulsion. this increased diversity in size distribution further compounds the problem of insufficient training dataset size. unfortunately, a method of exactly predicting peptide ion conformation is not developed yet.

detailed regression results on the three training datasets can be found in figure  <dig>  the drift time distributions of peptide ions with different charge states show an evident variance. most drift times of the singly-charged peptide ions range from  <dig> s to  <dig> s. the drift times of the doubly-charged peptide ions range from  <dig> s to  <dig> s, and the drift times of the triply-charged peptide ions range from  <dig> s to  <dig> s. the correlation coefficients between the predicted peptide ion drift time and the experimentally observed peptide ion drift time for the singly-, doubly-, and triply-charged peptide ions are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. such high correlation signifies that our proposed ann regression model can capture the general properties of peptide ion size for the prediction of drift time in imms measurements.

after constructing the ann regression model, we used the testing dataset, i.e., peptides from the protein subset {p2}, to check its performance. here the ann regression model utilizes four nodes in the input layer, three nodes in the hidden layer and one node in the output layer. the testing dataset contains  <dig> peptides generated from the five randomly selected proteins {p2}. overall there are  <dig> singly-charged peptide ions,  <dig> doubly-charged peptide ions and  <dig> triply-charged peptide ions. the prediction results of the ann regression model on the testing dataset are listed in table  <dig>  with a 15% of prediction variation threshold, we achieved prediction accuracy of  <dig>  for the singly-charge peptide ions,  <dig>  for the doubly-charged and  <dig>  for the triply-charged peptide ions. the mean difference between the experimental and the predicted values among the three charge states are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  ms, respectively. these prediction accuracies are very close to the performance of the ann model obtained in the training dataset, which indicates our proposed model can be generalized well for the prediction of peptide ion drift time.

the testing data were peptide digests of five randomly selected proteins. the tryptic digests of each protein were analyzed separately on imms. the drift time prediction performance for the peptide digest of each individual protein indicates the quality of prediction performance of our developed ann regression model on different experiments operated under the same experimental conditions. the mean differences between the observed and the predicted drift time values of all tryptic peptide ions for the five proteins are  <dig> ,  <dig> , - <dig> , - <dig> , and - <dig>  ms, respectively. this small prediction difference among different protein digests, i.e., the different imms experiments, indicates our proposed prediction model is robust for the prediction of peptide ion drift time from repetitious experiments.

it is well known that the prediction ability of an ann depends on the model training. in the model training phase, there are two key elements. one is the quality of the original data; another is the architecture of model. these two facets are synergistically linked to each other. because our original data is dependent on the original experimental environment, this model is applicable for the present experimental conditions. under new conditions, our present model should be trained again and adjusted to the new states.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, an ann regression model was developed to predict peptide ion drift time for imms measurements. to evaluate our proposed model, we tested its performance on a testing dataset which was not used during the model construction and training. the similar prediction accuracy between the training dataset and the testing dataset indicates the possibility of using the prediction results of the present model to assist protein identification efforts in proteomics studies. we achieved  <dig> % prediction accuracy for + <dig> peptide ions and  <dig> % for + <dig> ions. the relatively high level of performance indicated the capability of our proposed method. in addition, a simple net architecture consisting of four input nodes, three hidden nodes and one output node, makes our model more effective because the more simple net architecture is, the faster the ann training and prediction will be. a relatively low prediction accuracy,  <dig> %, for the + <dig> peptide ions suggests that spatial conformations of peptides with higher charge states presents an additional level of sample complexity that is not currently addressed in our current ann model. combining the conformation information, such as secondary structure formation, ion elongation, or interaction between peptide residues, into the present model will improve prediction capability and is the aim of future work. furthermore, we plan to generalize the ann model to predict the drift time of peptides with various post-translational modifications.
