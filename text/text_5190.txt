BACKGROUND
the inflammatory bowel diseases , crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, are relatively common chronic disorders considered to develop due to an aberrant immune response to intestinal microbes in a genetically susceptible host  <cit> . human data and murine models both implicate the involvement of luminal bacteria in ibd pathogenesis. for example, inflammation is induced by direct delivery of fecal material into non-inflamed bowel loops in susceptible individuals  <cit>  and diversion of feces results in distal improvement in mucosal inflammation  <cit> . in addition, most of the genes associated with susceptibility to ibd, including nod2/card <dig>  atg16l <dig> and irgm encode proteins involved in host-microbial interactions  <cit> . further support for the involvement of microbes in the pathogenesis of ibd is based on the observation that colitis does not occur in most gene knock-out models of ibd when animals are reared in germ-free conditions  <cit> .

recent advances in molecular techniques have identified a reduction in the phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes in ibd patients  <cit> . although several organisms have been proposed as a cause of ibd, there is still no compelling evidence that any one specific microbe is the etiologic agent. mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis has been suggested by some investigators  <cit> , although this remains an area of ongoing controversy  <cit> . most recently, absence of faecalibacterium prausnitzii from the ileum of patients with crohn disease undergoing surgical resection was associated with recurrence of disease, suggesting a protective role for this commensal organism  <cit> .

observations linking ibd to an increase in adherent escherichia coli strains have also been recognized over the past decade  <cit> . invasive properties of some of these isolates, including e. coli strain lf <dig> , led to the proposition that adherent-invasive e. coli strains  are involved in disease pathogenesis  <cit> . such an association is supported by the isolation of aiec from 36% of ileal lesions in post-surgical resection crohn disease patients, compared to just 6% of healthy controls  <cit> , accompanied by increased prevalence and diversity of aiec strains in patients with crohn disease  <cit> . although some of the mechanisms by which these bacteria lead to colonization and intestinal injury, such as induction of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell-adhesion molecule - <dig> receptor expression by tnf-α  <cit> , have been well characterized, other virulence traits remain to be determined.

defects in the structure and function of apical junctional complexes  are implicated in both patients with ibd and in animal models of ibd  <cit> . in this context, the adverse effects of microbes on intercellular junctions offer potential bridges connecting bacteria to the pathogenesis of ibd. barrier dysfunction precedes the relapse of crohn disease in asymptomatic patients  <cit>  and is also seen in unaffected first-degree relatives, who are at increased risk of subsequently developing the illness  <cit> . recent studies demonstrate specific distribution patterns of the tight junction proteins claudin  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  &  <dig> in ibd patients, which correlate with increased gut permeability  <cit> . for these reasons, the aim of this study was to define the ability of aiec strain lf <dig> to disrupt model epithelial cell polarized monolayers. we describe herein increased permeability of polarized epithelia infected with aiec as well as morphologic disruption of apical junction complexes.

methods
epithelial cells in tissue culture
t <dig> and madin-darby canine kidney -i cells are polarized epithelial cells that form ajcs, resulting in high electrical resistance, and are widely used for studying the effects of bacteria on permeability  <cit> . t <dig> human colon cancer epithelial cells were cultured in dulbecco's minimal essential medium /f- <dig>  10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum , 2% penicillin-streptomycin, 2% sodium bicarbonate and  <dig> % l-glutamine. mdck-i cells were grown in dmem, 10% fbs and 2% penicillin-streptomycin . cells were maintained in  <dig> cm <dig> flasks  and then grown on 12-well transwells  or 24-well plates . non-polarized intestine  <dig>  cells were cultivated in minimal essential medium , 10% fbs and 2% penicillin-streptomycin .

bacterial strains
enterohemorrhagic e. coli , strain cl <dig> serotype o157:h <dig>  <cit> , non-pathogenic e. coli, laboratory strain hb <dig>  used as a negative control, and adherent-invasive e. coli , strain lf <dig> serotype o83:h <dig>  a generous gift from dr. darfeuille-michaud   <cit>  were stored at -80°c and re-grown on 5% sheep blood agar plates at 37°c. colonies were transferred from plates into penassay broth and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> h, and re-grown in 10: <dig> fresh penassay broth . multiplicity of infection  used for all experiments was 100: <dig>  to determine whether live bacteria were required for the observed effects, bacterial suspensions were either boiled at 100°c for  <dig> min or fixed with formaldehyde for  <dig> h prior to infection of cell monolayers.

measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance  and macromolecular permeability
mdck-i and t <dig> cells were plated onto transwells  and grown until ajcs developed . twenty four hours prior to infection the tissue culture medium was removed and fresh medium without antibiotics, but with fbs, was added. fbs was maintained throughout the infection period. transwells were then infected with either ehec o157:h <dig>  e. coli hb <dig> or aiec  introduced either to the apical or basolateral aspect of the transwell. sham control monolayers were treated in an identical fashion, excluding the addition of bacteria. ter was measured prior to and  <dig> h after infection, using a millicell-ers voltmeter and chopstick electrodes . ter of transwells without cells was  <dig> Ω·cm <dig>  results are expressed as a percentage, relative to sham control wells.

dextran flux was used to measure paracellular macromolecular permeability  <cit> . after  <dig> h of infection, monolayers were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline  and infrared-labeled dextran  was then inserted into the apical compartment of transwells. after  <dig> h at 37°c, the basal compartment was sampled, diluted 1: <dig>  and loaded into 96-well plates for infrared signal quantification using an imaging system at  <dig> nm . integrated intensities were expressed relative to sham control polarized monolayers.

confocal microscopy for zonula occludens- <dig>  and lysosomal-associated membrane protein -1
for zo- <dig> staining, mdck-i cell monolayers were grown to confluence  on  <dig>  mm transwells and then infected with aiec, strain lf <dig> at a moi of 100: <dig> for  <dig> h at 37°c. monolayers were then washed  <dig> times with pbs and fixed with 100% cold methanol for  <dig> min at 4°c, blocked with 5% skim milk  for  <dig> h at room temperature and then incubated with primary rabbit anti-zo- <dig> antibodies  for  <dig> h at room temperature. after rinsing  <dig> times for  <dig> min with pbs, cell monolayers were incubated with secondary antibodies, cy2-goat anti-rabbit , for  <dig> h at 20°c. after two further washes,  <dig> nm of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  was added for  <dig> min, and rinsed off twice. membranes supporting the monolayers were then excised and mounted onto glass slides .

for lamp <dig> staining, intestine  <dig> cells were grown on glass cover slips in 24-well plates overnight and then either left uninfected or infected with aiec, strain lf <dig> for  <dig> h at 37°c . wells were washed  <dig> times with pbs  and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in pbs for  <dig> min at 20°c. wells were then washed with pbs and permeabilized with triton-x  <dig>  and blocked overnight with 5% skim milk  at 4°c. wells were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-lamp <dig> antibodies  for  <dig> h at 20°c, washed  <dig> times in pbs and then incubated with secondary antibody, cy3-goat anti-mouse  for  <dig> h at 20°c. dapi staining was performed, as detailed above, and coverslips mounted onto glass slides.

all samples were examined using a leica dmire <dig> quorum spinning disk confocal scan head inverted fluorescence microscope , equipped with a hamamatsu back-thinned em-ccd camera , at 63× objective. images were acquired and analyzed using velocity  <dig> . <dig> acquisition software .

transmission electron microscopy
confluent mdck-i transwells were left uninfected or infected with aiec, strain lf <dig> . support membranes were washed, excised and cells fixed in formaldehyde  and glutaraldehyde  in phosphate buffer, and then post-fixed in osmium tetroxide . specimens were dehydrated in a graded series of acetone, and subsequently infiltrated and embedded in epon-araldite epoxy resin. the processing steps from post fixation to polymerization of resin blocks were carried out in a microwave oven . ultrathin sections were cut with a diamond knife , stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and then examined by transmission electron microscopy  at  <dig> kv. digital electron micrographs were acquired directly with a  <dig> ×  <dig> pixels ccd camera system .

RESULTS
aiec infection decreases ter in t <dig> and mdck-i epithelial cell monolayers
similar to ehec o157:h <dig>  apical infection for  <dig> h with aiec, strain lf <dig> caused a 46% reduction in ter in human colonic t <dig> cells . when the pathogen was introduced into the basolateral aspect of monolayers there was an 81% reduction in ter, relative to sham control monolayers, with aiec infection , compared to a 50% reduction with ehec infection . in contrast, both apical and basolateral infection of t <dig> monolayers with non-pathogenic e. coli, strain hb <dig> did not lead to a reduction in ter .

apical and basolateral infections of canine kidney-derived mdck-i polarized monolayers with ehec and aiec caused a comparable reduction of 53–73% in ter . live bacteria were required, because there was no drop in ter with either heat-inactivated or formaldehyde-fixed bacteria . the effects were not due to the metabolic activity of bacteria on epithelial cells, since incubation with tissue culture medium corrected to ph  <dig>  did not reduce ter .

macromolecular permeability increases following aiec infection of mdck-i monolayers
transcytosis of a 10-kda dextran probe across monolayers supported the ter results. consistent with previous reports  <cit> , ehec o157:h <dig> caused a dramatic increase in permeability to dextran, indicating breakdown of the epithelial barrier. infection with aiec also resulted in increased dextran permeability in mdck-i cells  comparable to findings seen with ehec infection . there was a similar, but more modest, increase in permeability of t <dig> monolayers infected with aiec . there was no difference in permeability between apical and basolateral bacterial infections of monolayers of both cell types. increases in permeability were not the result of epithelial cell death, since cells were still present in monolayers after  <dig> h of infection .

aiec infection alters the distribution of zo-1
sham control mdck-i cells  demonstrated a normal distribution of zo- <dig>  delineating intact apical cellular junction complexes  <cit> . consistent with effects on permeability,  <dig> h infection of mdck-i monolayers with aiec, strain lf <dig>  led to profound disruption of zo- <dig> with large gaps between cells with punctate and interrupted distribution of zo- <dig>  indicating disruption of this integral tight junction protein  <cit> . nevertheless, cells in the monolayer remained viable, as demonstrated by the presence of nuclei and maintenance of normal cells shape and morphology.

disruption of mdck-i monolayers is accompanied by aiec invasion and bacterial replication
transmission electron microscopy of infected mdck-i monolayers was used to define the effect of aiec infection of polarized monolayers. in contrast to sham control epithelial monolayers, which demonstrated tightly placed cells without expanded intercellular spaces , aiec-infected mdck-i monolayers were disordered after  <dig> h of incubation, with spaces evident between adjacent cells and disruption of intercellular spaces. loss of cellular polarity was also observed, as demonstrated by presence of microvilli on the lateral aspect of infected cells. furthermore, consistent with previous reports  <cit> , multiple bacteria were seen within cells  <dig> h after infection with effective replication, indicating that these organisms survive within the cytoplasm of epithelial cells . extension of bacterial infection to  <dig> h resulted in profound disruption of the monolayer, with complete separation between cells and terminal changes in cells, including loss of membrane integrity, chromatin condensation and ballooning of mitochondria . this effect may be the result of bacterial overgrowth after  <dig> h of infection.

invasive aiec are found within a membrane-bound, lamp <dig> positive intracellular compartment
the ability of invasive microbes to survive in cells is dependent on creating a protective niche for replication  <cit> . invasive aiec were found in membrane-bound compartments  <dig> h after infection . presence of multiple organisms in one compartment suggests that they can effectively replicate within these vacuoles. since the membrane appeared to be partially missing, it is possible that bacteria were escaping the vacuole.

confocal microscopy of infected intestine  <dig> cells, using an antibody against the late endosomal marker lamp <dig>  demonstrated that aiec co-localized with this marker after  <dig> h of infection, indicating that vacuoles containing invasive aiec were directed to the endosomal pathway in epithelial cells .

discussion
the intestinal barrier is comprised of a single layer of polarized epithelial cells serving to separate the luminal content, including microbes, from the underlying mucosa. breaches in the epithelial barrier integrity result in penetration of luminal antigens and microbes, which stimulate pro-inflammatory responses, leading to chronic intestinal and systemic diseases, including ibd  <cit> . the importance of barrier maintenance in ibd is further highlighted by the development of colitis in mice expressing constitutively active myosin light chain kinase, which is involved in regulating the epithelial barrier  <cit> . ajcs are common targets of bacterial virulence, as displayed by multiple infection models affecting the integrity of the epithelial barrier  <cit> . targeting of ajcs can be mediated by either bacterial toxins or effectors, by direct contact of the pathogen and by indirect effects on signaling pathways involved in host regulation of junction-associated proteins.

recent research related to microbes isolated from patients with crohn disease highlight a role for adherent-invasive e. coli strains, including strain lf <dig>  in the pathogenesis of ibd  <cit> . studies have focused on bacterial adhesion, invasion and replication in both epithelial cells and macrophages, as well as the accompanying inflammatory response  <cit> . for example, epithelial surface adhesions, such as ceacams, mediate attachment of various bacterial pathogens  <cit> . the association between lf <dig> and crohn disease is linked to up-regulation of ceacam <dig> and ceacam <dig> by intestinal epithelial cells, which is induced by lf <dig> through tnf-α secretion  <cit> . nevertheless, the ability of these microbes to disrupt the integrity of the epithelial barrier has not been extensively studied. only a single published study describes aiec-induced barrier disruption of caco- <dig> cells  <cit> . therefore, we employed transformed human colonic t <dig> cells and canine kidney mdck-i cells as model polarized epithelia, which both express mature apical junctional complex proteins and maintain cell polarity  <cit> , and are used extensively to study host-microbial interactions  <cit> . furthermore, the utility of polarized epithelial monolayers in the study of aiec infection was recently reported by eaves-pyles et al.  <cit>  that demonstrated chemokine secretion by aiec-infected caco- <dig> and t <dig> monolayers leading to transmigration of immune cells.

our findings indicate that infection of polarized monolayers with aiec, strain lf <dig> leads to disruption of epithelial cell monolayers, as demonstrated by both reduced transepithelial electrical resistance and increased macromolecular permeability, as well as morphological defects in the structure of the ajcs of infected monolayers. the ability of invasive bacteria to disrupt monolayer integrity is described for some intestinal pathogens, such as shigella flexneri, listeria monocytogenes  <cit>  and campylobacter jejuni  <cit> , while other bacteria, such as helicobacter pylori, appear to alter ajcs without entering into the cytoplasm  <cit> . since aiec strains are associated with ibd, host cell invasion and barrier disruption, as presented in this study, are mechanisms that could contribute to intestinal injury and immune stimulation in affected patients.

sasaki et al.  <cit>  demonstrated the ability of lf <dig>  as well as other aiec strains, to reduce ter of caco- <dig> monolayers and displace both zo- <dig> and e-cadherin from ajcs. our results confirm these findings in additional polarized epithelial cell lines and also reveal an increase in macromolecular permeability of infected monolayers. in addition, we show that introducing bacteria to the basolateral surface of t <dig> monolayers leads to a more profound reduction in ter. the significance of this finding is highlighted by the suggestion that other enteric pathogens, such as c. jejuni, enter epithelial cells through the basolateral membrane  <cit> .

our findings show that aiec can replicate in membrane-bound vesicles, which positively stain with the late endosomal marker lamp <dig>  similar to these findings, previous work suggests that strain lf <dig> is present in vacuoles in epithelial cells after invasion, but is also seen in the cytoplasm, suggesting that these bacteria can escape from the vacuoles  <cit> . nevertheless, the phagocytic pathway involved in aiec invasion of epithelial cells has not been characterized. similar to our findings in epithelial cells, lf <dig> co-localizes with lamp <dig> in infected macrophages  <cit> , suggesting that there are common features in the intracellular fate of these microorganisms in different cell types.

the ability of aiec to survive and replicate within the cytoplasm of epithelial cells is of relevance in ibd, since defects in the handling of intercellular microbes are considered to contribute to disease pathogenesis  <cit> . for example, absence of nod <dig> in transgenic mice results in increased susceptibility to infection with intracellular pathogens, such as mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> . furthermore, the autophagy protein atg16l <dig>  which is also implicated in the pathogenesis of ibd  <cit> , is involved in inflammatory responses to invasive microbes. mice lacking atg16l <dig> are more susceptible to chemically-induced colitis than wild-type animals subject of the same stress  <cit> . therefore, it is plausible that defective handling of invasive aiec strains in patients with ibd who have genetic mutations linked to defects in microbial processing contributes to intestinal injury, as suggested by increased response of monocytes from crohn disease patients with nod <dig> mutations to aiec infection in vitro  <cit> . the findings of our study support the ability of aiec to subvert one of the first lines of host innate defence, the epithelial cell barrier.

taken together, these findings provide an improved understanding of mechanisms leading to intestinal injury and chronic immune stimulation by an aiec bacterial strain that has been linked to ibd pathogenesis. further insight into the mechanisms of epithelial barrier disruption and subversion of host defenses by intestinal pathogens is essential for developing novel strategies to interrupt the infectious process and thereby prevent its complications, including ibd.

CONCLUSIONS
the invasive e. coli strain lf <dig>  which is linked to ibd, disrupts ajcs of polarized epithelial monolayers and leads to increased macromolecular permeability and morphological interruption of intercellular tight junctions. after invasion into epithelial cells, the bacteria replicate within late endosomes. these findings contribute to current understanding of bacterial-mediated processes related to the pathogenesis of ibd and offer potential targets for intervening early in the course of the disease process.
