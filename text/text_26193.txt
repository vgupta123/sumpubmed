BACKGROUND
lameness is an important problem in modern swine husbandry. prevalence of lameness in a cross-sectional study in the united kingdom was estimated to be  <dig> % in pregnant gilts,  <dig> % in pregnant sows and  <dig> % in finishing pigs  <cit> . lameness has negative consequences from an animal welfare as well as from an economic point of view. the negative consequences of lameness on animal welfare are primarily due to pain and the resulting reduced mobility. a lame pig may not be able to reach feeding and drinking facilities and at the same time has a higher risk to be overrun by penmates, encountering additional trauma further reducing its welfare. the economic impact of lameness is caused by lower productivity and higher costs of treatment or even early culling of affected animals  <cit> .

to minimize the aforementioned negative consequences of lameness and increase the chances of recovery it is critical to detect lame pigs as early as possible. subtle changes in posture or weight bearing may occur in early stages of the disease process, and can easily be missed when gait is only assessed visually  <cit> . furthermore, these changes can easily be overlooked in a pen with many pigs. fast, sensitive, yet practical methods to detect lameness are necessary to help farmers to provide timely care for lame pigs, and to adequately measure the effect of interventions. therefore, an objective method that does not only identify lame pigs but also quantifies the degree of lameness is needed to provide evidence-based information.

several techniques have been developed for this purpose. the simplest and least expensive methods are lameness scoring systems based on visual inspection. the visual lameness scoring system for finishing pigs developed by main et al.  <cit>  incorporates gait characteristics , posture and behavior . although visual scoring is fast and inexpensive, research in horses and dogs has shown that it may suffer from inherent subjectivity, is affected by observer bias and has limited intra- and inter-rater agreement, especially in untrained observers and in mild lameness  <cit> . similarly, visual grading of mild lameness in pigs has been proven to be subjective  <cit> . these drawbacks underline the need for a more objective method to quantify lameness.

kinematic techniques have been used in pigs to study the effect of different flooring types on locomotion  <cit>  and to quantify lameness in sows  <cit> , although this rather complicated, expensive and time-consuming methodology is unlikely to be extrapolated to a practical situation. therefore, in pigs as well as in other species, force plates have become ‘the gold standard’ to objectively evaluate kinetic gait variables. they have been used in pigs to study the effect of different flooring types on gait kinetics  <cit>  and to assess lameness in sows  <cit> . a major drawback in the use of force plates is that they cannot distinguish between several feet simultaneously in contact with the plate. therefore, data collection can be time-consuming, or multiple consecutive force plates are needed to gather data of all limbs. the two parameters most often used in force plate analysis, peak vertical force  and vertical impulse  are strongly influenced by velocity  <cit> . therefore, velocity needs to be controlled within strict limits if footfalls from different runs are to be compared to each other. this might be a problem in pigs, since they are difficult to handle and to guide over the runway at a certain pace.

pressure mats may provide a solution to this problem, as they contain a dense array of pressure sensors with a high measuring frequency, enabling them to distinguish simultaneous impacts of different limbs. this equipment allows measuring kinetic as well as spatiotemporal data of simultaneous and even consecutive footfalls. systems of different manufacturers have been used successfully to evaluate locomotion in sound horses  <cit> , cows  <cit> , sheep  <cit> , dogs  <cit> , and cats  <cit> , and to assess lameness in dogs  <cit>  and cows  <cit> . previous studies have shown that pressure-measuring systems may be useful to study the pressure distribution within each claw  <cit>  and to measure pvf symmetry in an experimental lameness model in sows  <cit> . however, comprehensive baseline data describing the replicability, longitudinal development, and major confounding effects on pressure mat variables in weaned piglets are lacking.

therefore, the aim of this experiment was to investigate the use of a pressure mat to evaluate longitudinal development of locomotion in growing, weaned pigs. multiple pressure mat measurements were performed weekly during 10 weeks, starting at the age of 5 weeks. we evaluated the replicability of body-weight normalized peak vertical force , load rate , vertical impulse  and peak vertical pressure  as well as asymmetry indices  of these variables, to establish baseline data for pressure mat analysis in growing pigs.

RESULTS
at the start of the experiment, pigs’ body mass was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kg. at the end of the experiment, 10 weeks later, their body mass had increased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kg. the overall mean velocity of valid runs was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  m/s. the experimental setup is illustrated in figure  <dig>  bodymass, velocity and duty factor per week are summarized in figure  <dig> 

pathology
the limb joints did not show any macroscopic abnormalities. longitudinal cuts through the humerus, radius, ulna, femur, tibia, and fibula were macroscopically normal. no abnormalities were noted in skin, muscles, or connective tissue in any of the limbs. therefore, all pigs were considered to be sound and healthy at scheduled necropsy.

replicability
intra-class correlations  between runs on the same day were fair to excellent. icc for nlr was the lowest , followed by the icc for npvf  and npvp . icc for nvi was the highest .

discussion
this study is the first to explore the use of a pressure mat for longitudinal measurement of porcine locomotion and to establish baseline data for pressure mat analysis in weaned pigs. the data collection with the pressure mat was fast and efficient, and a maximum of 10 minutes per pig was needed to collect  <dig> valid runs. training of the pigs proved to be simple and effective. the preparation of data for analysis, however, was very time-consuming, mainly because the software used in this study is designed for human gait analysis, and as such could not automatically distinguish the  <dig> limbs of the pigs. all footprints had to be assigned manually. some other pressure mat manufacturers  do provide software that can distinguish the  <dig> limbs of, for example dogs, automatically.

replicability
intra-class correlations for pressure mat kinetic variables showed that data within one day were highly replicable, which is in agreement with a previous study in ponies by oosterlinck et al.  <cit>  reporting a high replicability of npvf and nvi, and a slightly lower replicability of npvp. oosterlinck et al.  <cit>  hypothesized that the higher variability in npvp  might have been due to limitations in the dynamic response of the activated sensors in the pressure mat.

absolute values of pressure mat kinetic variables
mass-normalized forelimb npvf was considerably lower in trotting pigs than in trotting ponies  <cit> , horses  <cit>  and dogs  <cit> . mean hind limb npvf was also lower than found in dogs  <cit> . nvi of the front limbs was lower than found in dogs  <cit>  and ponies  <cit> . some of these differences may be associated with differences in measuring equipment setup, such as measuring frequency and calibration. the relatively low measuring frequency in our study  may have caused some data points to be missed. however, this explanation is unlikely considering the mean stance time of a pig in our study . we still have an average of  <dig> data points per curve, resulting in a smooth force graph. also, the calibration procedures for pressure mats vary between studies, which may make comparison of variables more difficult. when comparing pressure mat data to force plate data, it has been shown in horses that a pressure mat cannot be used interchangeably to a force plate to measure absolute values of limb loading as it has limitations in accuracy  <cit> , especially at impact and breakover  <cit> . the dynamic response of the pressure-measuring sensors may be slower than that of the piëzo-electric measurements of force plates, as was suggested by besancon et al.  <cit>  and oosterlinck et al.  <cit> .

the npvp of the front limbs was higher than that found in ponies  <cit> . since the npvf was lower than in ponies, the magnitude of the npvf cannot be the reason for the higher npvp. since npvp is influenced by both npvf and contact area, it may be that the contact properties of pig hooves promote higher npvp. further investigations of the npvf and npvp in different areas of the porcine hoof, using a pressure mat, may provide more information on this subject.

little research is available on nlr, making this parameter hard to compare to other studies.

effect of velocity
in this study, pigs were trained to trot across the runway at a steady pace. in studies in other species, such as dogs, horses and sheep the animals were often led by a handler. the advantage of leading the animals across the runway is that it will take less time to collect valid runs, since the animal can be guided to walk in a straight line, at a steady pace and within certain speed limits.

since pigs resist to being handled by a collar, another method had to be used. training the pigs to trot over the runway without any form of guidance made sure the pig was trotting in a natural pattern and looking straight ahead, not turning their head or looking up or down.

because the pigs were running without any guidance, the velocity of the pigs could not be strictly controlled. still, the spread of the velocities was not very large. velocity was measured by the pressure mat. in a previous study in dogs, pressure mat and photoelectric switch measurements of velocity yielded highly similar results  <cit> . velocity significantly influenced npvf, nlr and npvp. the influence of velocity on npvf is in agreement with previous reports in other species  <cit> . in the hind limbs of walking and trotting dogs, an increase of velocity is associated with a higher npvf and a lower nvi  <cit> . surprisingly, in the pigs we did not find a significant relationship between velocity and nvi. vertical impulse is the amount of force applied over a certain amount of time  and therefore depends on the stance time and the vertical force. normally, with increasing speed the decrease in stance time is relatively more pronounced than the increase in npvf, resulting in a decrease in nvi. in the present study, an increase of 1 m/s in speed caused a  <dig>  n/kg increase in npvf. it is unclear whether this effect may have been large enough to outweigh the effect of decreasing stance time with speed.

there is little information on the effect of velocity on nlr in quadrupeds. mclaughlin et al.  <cit>  did, however, show that with increasing velocity, npvf increases and stance time decreases in both horses and dogs. this could explain the effect of velocity on load rate, since a higher npvf has to be achieved during a shorter time period.

in the present study, contact area was not affected by velocity. as npvp is force per unit of area, it is possible that at higher velocities npvp increases due to increasing npvf while contact area remains constant.

effect of time
in this study, a significant difference between longitudinal measurements of mass-normalized npvf, nlr, nvi and npvp was found. it is known that besides speed, inter-trial variability is the most important confounding factor  <cit> . lascelles et al.  <cit> , however, did not find significant differences in pressure mat values for pvf and vi in measurements made 1 week apart in clinically normal mixed-breed dogs. importantly, the latter studies were performed in adult dogs. in the present study, young, growing piglets were used, and even though the kinetic data were corrected for body mass, conformational changes occurred over the study period. breed-dependent differences in kinetic data have been shown in dogs  <cit>  and horses  <cit> . thus, it seems possible that conformational changes in growing piglets may account for part of the longitudinal variation, especially because we followed the piglets for a long period of time compared to the studies by mölsa et al.  <cit> , voss et al.  <cit>  and back et al.  <cit> .

differences between fore- and hind limb
our results on the difference in fore- and hind limb data for npvf are in agreement with data in other species with a reported distribution of bodyweight of approximately 30% on each front limb and 20% on each hind limb  <cit> .

asymmetry indices
symmetry is generally assumed to be a characteristic feature of normal locomotion  <cit> , whereas a substantial lack of symmetry usually correlates with the presence of pathology/lameness  <cit> . the trot is a symmetric gait, facilitating comparison of left vs. right limbs. our results indicate a very low degree of asymmetry in sound pigs. however, some degree of asymmetry can even be observed in sound individuals  <cit> . similar as reported in dogs  <cit> , the 2 m-pressure mat in the present study allowed the recording of contra-lateral and consecutive foot strikes, and therefore, asi between contra-lateral limbs were not affected by inter-trial variability. notwithstanding the fact that the range of asi observed in the present study was larger than the degree of symmetry reported in dogs  <cit>  and ponies  <cit> , there were no significant differences in asi over a prolonged time. therefore, asi are a highly promising tool for the longitudinal analysis of locomotion, prospecting evidence-based evaluation of lameness, effects of treatments etc. cut-off values of asi obtained from pressure mat analysis to distinguish lame and sound pigs have not yet been determined, but the present study provides normative data for asi’s in young, sound pigs.

in agreement with previous work by oosterlinck et al.  <cit> , our results did not present a significant influence of velocity on asi’s. this is particularly interesting for the measurement of gait in pigs, since in this species it is difficult to maintain a fixed speed over several trials without disturbing the natural gait of the animal. from a practical point of view, for this type of pressure mat further development of software for use in quadrupeds is needed. in order to facilitate the analysis and subsequent interpretation of kinetic symmetry in a clinical situation using this particular kind of pressure mat, automated selection and calculation of symmetry ratios would be interesting. the software currently available allows the automated selection of human feet, whereas in our study, manual selection of each footprint was needed. in large datasets, this may be time consuming and therefore the automated allocation of left/right fore and hind hoof prints in combination with automated calculation of symmetry indices between contra-lateral, ipsilateral and diagonal limb pairs would facilitate a swift interpretation of kinetic data.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study provides normative kinetic data for young, sound pigs. based on the significant effects of velocity, fore vs. hind limb, and measuring session on absolute values of kinetic variables, it is advised to set limits for speed. moreover, measurements that are set apart in time  should be interpreted cautiously, especially in young growing pigs in which conformation may change. fore- and hind limbs present different absolute values of limb loading and this must be accounted for when interpreting results.

in the present study, the pressure mat allowed recording contra-lateral and consecutive foot strikes. asi’s of contra-lateral limbs were shown to have excellent replicability over time, and were not affected by speed. therefore, we recommend the use of asi of kinetic variables in further studies focusing on the discrimination between lame and sound pigs, the early detection of lameness, and the evidence-base evaluation of treatments.
