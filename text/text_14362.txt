BACKGROUND
parasitic nematodes of livestock animals are of major socio-economic importance worldwide due to the diseases and production losses that they cause. haemonchus contortus  is one of the most important nematodes of the abomasum  of small ruminants. the disease  caused by this parasite represents ~15% of all gastrointestinal diseases of small ruminants worldwide and causes major financial losses http://www.fao.org. haemonchus contortus is a blood-feeding worm that causes anaemia and associated complications, leading to death in severely affected animals  <cit> . in the abomasum of the ruminant host, the oviparous adult females release eggs via the faeces into the environment, in which first-stage larvae  develop and then hatch . the l1s develop into second-stage larvae , which then moult to become infective third-stage larvae . the cuticle from the l <dig> is retained as a sheath around the l <dig> and protects this stage from environmental pressures. infective l3s are ingested with herbage by the host, pass through the forestomachs and undergo an exsheathment process to then establish, via the parasitic fourth-stage larvae , to dioecious haematophagous adults within ~ <dig> weeks  <cit> .

the exsheathment process marks the transition from the free-living  to the parasitic  larval stage, at which h. contortus grows, develops and commences feeding on the blood of the host  <cit> . early studies examined aspects of this process in nematodes in response to a host stimulus. evidence indicated that at least two separate pathways control these responses  <cit> . these pathways are stimulated by gaseous co <dig> and mediated by carbonic anhydrase, leading to the secretion of the neurotransmitter noradrenaline  <cit> . noradrenaline then mediates the activation of genes required for further development and the release of exsheathment fluid to induce moulting of the l <dig> cuticle through a separate pathway. in the absence of co <dig> stimulation, both pathways appear to be inhibited in l3s by an analogue of the "insect juvenile hormone", which is implicated in the regulation of development in insects  <cit> . it has been suggested that the co <dig> cue is sensed by chemosensory neurons of the amphids  <cit> , which are sensory organs located in the head of l3s and are exposed to the external environment via a pore  <cit> . the exsheathment process can be induced in vitro  <cit>  and is recognised to suitably represent the process in vivo in the host animal  <cit> . in spite of knowledge of the exsheathment process, the role of carbonic anhydrase and the chemoreception are poorly understood in h. contortus, and the exact nature of the regulation and components of the "downstream" molecular pathways are not yet known  <cit> .

despite these substantial knowledge gaps for h. contortus, rogers and petronijevic  <cit>  did hypothesize early that there is likely to be a specific pattern of gene expression during the development of nematodes, whereby genes which control continuous "house-keeping" processes and maintain survival are expressed on a constitutive basis, whereas genes which have specific functions in one or more stages of development are regulated for expression exclusively at specific developmental time points. although studies of h. contortus have shown that the pattern of transcription differs between free-living and parasitic stages  <cit> , there has been no detailed study of the molecular alterations occurring during the early phase of transition to parasitism in this parasite, although there is some information for the canine hookworm, ancylostoma caninum  <cit> . insights into the transcriptome of h. contortus during this critical phase of establishment in its host would enhance knowledge of developmental processes at the molecular level and might identify new intervention targets.

advances in genomic, proteomic and bioinformatic technologies  <cit>  now provide opportunities for exploring the molecular basis of developmental switches in h. contortus and other nematodes. in particular, the combined use of next-generation sequencing, such as  <dig> technology, solid and illumina/solexa  <cit>  and improved bioinformatic algorithms for the analysis and annotation of expressed sequence tag  datasets  <cit>  are suited to elucidate molecular changes at the transcriptomic level. in the present study, we  provide the first detailed insights into the transcriptome of h. contortus during its transition from the l <dig> to the exsheathed, parasitic xl <dig> stage using a next generation sequencing-based approach,  predict, employing a number of bioinformatic approaches, the functional roles of these molecules in larval development and the metabolic pathways linked to this transition, and  discuss the implications of the findings in relation to the fundamental, developmental biology of nematodes as well as applied aspects of developing new methods of nematode control.

RESULTS

ests/genomic sequences
results of the bioinformatic analyses of expressed sequence tag  and genomic sequences representing the ensheathed  or exsheathed  third larval stage of haemonchus contortus. numbers of sequences with open reading frames  and of predicted proteins classified according to their domains , gene ontologies  and/or biological pathways . the numbers of sequences with orthologues or homologues in caenorhabditis elegans, other parasitic nematodes and/or organisms other than nematodes are also listed.

the subsequent annotation of the proteins inferred for the l <dig> stage revealed  <dig>  different gene ontology  terms, of which  <dig> were linked to 'biological process',  <dig> 'cellular component' and  <dig> 'molecular function' . for xl <dig>   <dig>  go terms were identified, of which  <dig> represented 'biological process',  <dig> 'cellular component' and  <dig> 'molecular function'. for both l <dig> and xl <dig>  the most common go terms were 'translation'  and 'metabolic process'  for 'biological process', 'intracellular'  and 'ribosome'  for 'cellular component' and 'structural constituent of ribosome'  and 'catalytic activity'  for 'molecular function' . pathway mapping using kegg orthology-based annotation system  predicted a total of  <dig> different pathways, of which the most represented were 'ribosome', 'oxidative phosphorylation', 'chaperones and folding catalysts' .

subtractive bioinformatic analysis identified  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotide sequences as being uniquely transcribed in the l <dig> and xl <dig> stages, respectively . the uniqueness of selected  transcripts was verified by independent reverse transcription pcr-coupled sequencing of amplicons. of the sequences unique to l <dig>   <dig> had orthologues in caenorhabditis elegans ,  <dig> % of which encoded ribosomal proteins , collagens and elongation factors . of the  <dig> functional domains predicted for all proteins, 'glutathione s-transferase/chloride channel' , 'homeodomain-like'  and 'morn motif'  were abundant. among the  <dig> go terms identified in the l3-'unique' dataset, the most common were 'isoprenoid biosynthetic process'  'dna recombination'  and 'dna replication' for 'biological process'; 'alpha dna polymerase, primase complex'  for 'cellular component'; and, 'cation binding' , 'metallo carboxypeptidase activity'  and '4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase activity'  for 'molecular function'. kobas mapping revealed links to  <dig> different pathways, of which 'biosynthesis and biodegradation of secondary metabolites' and 'cell motility and secretion' were the most commonly represented .

of the  <dig> sequences unique to xl <dig>   <dig> had known orthologues in c. elegans, the largest number  representing peptidases and other enzymes of the amino acid catabolism  . among the  <dig> functional domains identified in the interproscan analysis, 'globin' or 'globin-like' domains  had the greatest representation . the go analysis identified a total of  <dig> terms, the most common being 'oxygen transport' , 'regulation of phosphorylation'  and 'nitrogen compound metabolic process'  for 'metabolic process'; 'transcription factor tfiia complex'  for 'cellular component'; and, 'oxygen binding' , 'phosphoric ester hydrolase activity'  and 'dopamine beta-monooxygenase activity'  for 'molecular function' . among the seven kobas pathways predicted for the xl3-specific data, 'cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction' and 'd-arginine and d-ornithine metabolism' were most commonly represented .

twenty-one c. elegans orthologues  unique to l <dig>  were predicted to interact directly with a total of  <dig> other genes . in contrast, seven c. elegans orthologues  unique to xl <dig>  were inferred to interact with  <dig> other genes . the functional classification of the c. elegans orthologues of molecules which were unique to l <dig> revealed one predominant group linked to 'embryonic development' ; this cluster contained molecules associated with 'regulation of development' and other pathways, including 'positive regulation of growth', 'rna metabolism' and 'biosynthesis' . orthologues unique to xl <dig> also revealed one main cluster associated with 'embryonic development'  .

discussion
in h. contortus, the transition to parasitism was proposed to be accompanied by differences in the levels of transcription of particular genes that may facilitate the invasion of the host and the evasion of the immune response  <cit> . next-generation sequencing technology was used here to investigate the transcriptome of the h. contortus l <dig> before and after the exsheathment process in vitro. interestingly, ~75% of the sequences determined did not have orthologues/homologues in any other organism for which sequence data are available. however, annotation was enhanced through the mining of genomic data available for h. contortus , ultimately increasing the percentage of annotated sequences to ~50% for the l <dig> and xl <dig> datasets . the likely explanation for this result is technical and would appear to relate to a 3'-bias in sequence reads  <cit> , thus affecting the prediction of open reading frames  and, thus, the identification of orthologues/homologues. in the absence of the complete genome sequence for h. contortus, genomic mining provided the sole option for maximizing the mapping and subsequent annotation of sequences.

the integrated approach of using both transcriptomic and available genomic data allowed the annotation of a total of  <dig>  sequences, of which  <dig>  matched unique c. elegans orthologues. of the  <dig>  unique interpro domains identified, the most represented in both l <dig> and xl <dig> were the 'transthyretin-like' , 'calcium-binding ef-hand' , 'nad-binding'  and 'sperm-coating protein -like extracellular'  motifs . most 'transthyretin' proteins identified to date are conserved   <cit>  and have been recognized as enzymes of the purine catabolism that catalyse the conversion of 5-hydroxyisourate  to ohcu  <cit> . of the  <dig>  'nematode-specific' protein families encoded by 'nematode-restricted' genes, the 'transthyretin-like' proteins   <cit>  represent one of the largest groups  <cit> . indeed, members of the ttl family have been detected in plant parasitic nematodes, such as xiphinema index, heterodera glycines, meloidogyne incognita and radophilis similis  <cit> , the filarial nematode of humans, brugia malayi  <cit> , and ostertagia ostertagi of ruminants   <cit> . in o. ostertagi, at least  <dig> ttl genes have been identified by database mining; most of these genes are constitutively transcribed from the free-living l <dig> stage through to adult males and females  <cit> . in parasitic nematodes, ttls might play a role as carriers of lipophilic substances or hormones  <cit> . more recently, jacob and coworkers  <cit>  localized the expression of ttl genes to the ventral nerve of r. similis  and to the nervous system and hypodermis of c. elegans . these findings, together with the sequence similarity between ttls and some neuropeptides, suggest that these proteins play a yet uncharacterized role in the nematode nervous system  <cit> . in h. contortus, a ttl has been identified previously using a proteomic approach and shown to be the most immunogenic protein in excretory/secretory products  of the adult stage  <cit> . ttls are also highly abundant in e/s of the canine hookworm, a. caninum  <cit> . these latter two studies propose a central role for these proteins in the parasite-host interplay  <cit> , which warrants detailed investigations.

some host-parasite interactions have been reported to rely on the essential role played by calcium-mediated signalling pathways in protein secretion, motility, cell invasion and/or differentiation  <cit> . these functions are controlled by various, specialized subcellular structures  for the uptake and release of calcium, which acts as a secondary messenger for the activation of calcium-dependent proteins  <cit> , particularly those containing 'ef-hand' domains. in the present study, the large number of sequences  with such domains in the l <dig> and xl <dig> stages of h. contortus might reflect a substantial need for calcium ions in the cascade of developmental events occurring during larval growth, particularly those linked to the maturation of the nervous system, as proposed to function in the c. elegans dauer stage  <cit> . similarly, the redox reactions catalysed by oxidoreductases with a nad-binding domain are essential for all developmental processes  <cit> . the nad+, a coenzyme found in all living cells, is involved in redox reactions and carries electrons from one reaction to another. in contrast, the main function of nadp+ is as a reducing agent in anabolism, with this coenzyme being involved in key pathways, such as fatty acid synthesis and glucose metabolism  <cit> .

another relatively abundant group of sequences in both l <dig> and xl <dig> encoded key scp/tpx-1/ag5/pr-1/sc <dig> proteins , characterized by one or more scp-like extracellular domains   <cit> . in parasitic nematodes, such proteins are also called ancylostoma secreted proteins or activation-associated proteins , mainly because they were originally discovered in hookworms  <cit> . although the numbers of sequences encoding scp/taps  were similar in l <dig> and xl <dig> , there were some qualitative differences in transcription between these two stages. homologues of the molecules designated hc <dig> and hc <dig>  previously identified in excretory/secretory  products of adult h. contortus  <cit> , were encoded in both of these stages. however, other previously undescribed scp/taps, such as an inferred protein homologue  with no known homologues in any other nematode, were encoded only by sequences in xl <dig> . the finding of entirely novel scp/taps supports a previous hypothesis, formulated based on observations from transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, that a broader range of molecules of this group is expressed in h. contortus  <cit> . this finding also suggests a diversified, active and specific involvement of scp/taps in the exsheathment process, establishment of h. contortus in its host and/or the parasite-host interplay. current evidence indicates that the transcriptional profile for h. contortus in the transition from l <dig> to xl <dig> is quite distinct from that of a. caninum, in that there was a massive expansion in scp/taps in the serum-activated l <dig>  in the hookworm  <cit> . although there were methodological differences between studies, particularly in relation to the use of normalized cdna libraries herein, an apparent difference in the diversity of transcripts encoding scp/taps might reflect distinct roles for various types of these molecules in h. contortus compared with a. caninum during the invasion process in the host. specifically, l3s of h. contortus are ingested by the ruminant host, exsheath in the reticulo-rumen and establish in the abomasum, in which the xl3s start feeding on blood to subsequently develop into dioecious adults  <cit> . in contrast, infective l3s of a. caninum penetrate skin of the canid host, exsheath and then migrate as xl3s via the circulatory system and the lung to finally reside as adults in the small intestine; the dioecious hookworm adults attach via their buccal capsule to the intestinal mucosa, rupture capillaries and feed on blood  <cit> . some xl3s also undergo somatic migration to then encyst in tissues, such as muscle and the mammary gland, and become arrested as l3s  <cit> . therefore, the added biological complexity in the hookworm life cycle, particularly in the initial phases of invasion and migration as an xl <dig>  compared with the relatively simple gastric infection process for h. contortus, supports the current proposal of a very distinct arsenal of scp/taps  between the two nematodes during their transition to parasitism. nonetheless, only a direct comparison of transcription between l <dig> and xl <dig> for the two parasites using the same or a similar approach as employed herein will allow this hypothesis to be tested conclusively.

expressed sequence tags  inferred to encode scp/taps proteins in the ensheathed  or exsheathed  third larval stage of haemonchus contortus.

the in silico subtraction approach employed in the present study identified  <dig> and  <dig> sequences that were specific to h. contortus l <dig> and xl <dig>  respectively. the specificity of a subset of these transcripts was unequivocally verified by rtpcr-coupled sequencing . most of the subset of 'l3-specific' molecules with known orthologues in c. elegans encoded ribosomal proteins , collagens  and elongation factors  . in nematodes, the synthesis of collagens has been observed to increase significantly prior to a moult  <cit> , whereas ribosomal proteins have been reported to participate in various cellular processes besides protein biosynthesis. for instance, they can act as components of the translation apparatus and also regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis  <cit> . indeed, genetic interaction networking for c. elegans orthologues of h. contortus l3-specific transcripts predicted a number of genes coding for ribosomal proteins  to interact directly with a gtpase , which is required for phagocytosis during programmed cell death and for migration of the distal tip cells of the somatic gonad  <cit>  . in addition, the protein ced- <dig> has been demonstrated to be essential in the cascade of events which leads to the development of the nervous system in the growing and developing larva, by guiding the migrating cells and axonal growth cones to their final position in the body  <cit> . a direct interaction was also predicted between ced- <dig> and another c. elegans orthologue of an l3-specific transcript  encoding a proteasome alpha-type seven subunit of the core 20s proteasome subcomplex  involved in the 'ubiquitin proteasome system'   <cit> . loss-of-function in this system is known to be the primary cause or secondary consequence of pathological conditions of the nervous system . moreover, gene silencing of pas- <dig> in c. elegans has been shown to result in a wide variety of defects, including embryonic and larval lethality, sterility, abnormal locomotion, slow growth, and abnormal transgene expression and subcellular localization  <cit>   http:// http://www.wormbase.org. here, both ced- <dig> and pas- <dig> were predicted herein to interact with a c. elegans orthologue of sumo . sumo is a small ubiquitin-like moiety that, when attached to protein substrates, regulates subcellular localization and activity  <cit> . the loss of function of smo- <dig> results in developmental defects of the nervous and reproductive systems as well as embryonic or larval lethality  <cit> . based on the genetic interaction networks predicted for orthologues of h. contortus l3-specific molecules, it could be proposed that axon guidance and synapse formation, which are primarily controlled by ups, through the regulation of protein turnover at the growth cone and the synapse  <cit> , are crucial in the biology of the l <dig> of this parasitic nematode. this statement is supported by the fact that the exsheathment process is triggered by gaseous co <dig>  detected by chemosensory neurons of amphids, located in the anterior end of the l <dig>  <cit> , ultimately leading to the secretion of the neurotransmitter noradrenaline  <cit> .

of the h. contortus xl3-specific transcripts, those predicted to be involved in mechanisms regulating chemotaxis during larval development were also highly represented. for example, the c. elegans orthologue ncs- <dig> encodes a neuronal calcium sensor protein, whose expression in c. elegans is primarily associated with two sensory organs, the head amphids and tail phasmids  <cit> . this orthologue was predicted to interact with  <dig> distinct genes involved in axon guidance, neuron projection, embryonic and/or larval development . however, the largest number of genetic interactions was predicted for a c. elegans orthologue of a h. contortus xl3-specific transcript encoding a subunit of the nuclear cap-binding complex . this complex includes rna-binding proteins that bind to the 5'-cap within the nucleus; when rna is exported to the cytoplasm, the nuclear cap-binding protein complex is replaced by cytoplasmic cap-binding complex  <cit> . although ncbp- <dig> has been demonstrated to play key roles in mrna decay, embryonic/larval development, reproduction and vulval morphogenesis  <cit> , its precise role in the biology of the developing larva is still unclear.

the largest number of c. elegans orthologues of h. contortus xl3-specific transcripts encoded peptidases and other enzymes of the amino acid catabolism . a similar spectrum of proteases and other molecules linked to catalytic activity have been shown also to be highly represented in the transcriptome of the serum-activated xl <dig> stage of a. caninum by comparison to its l <dig>  <cit> . this finding, for two haematophagous bursate nematodes with differing biologies, is likely to reflect the key roles that these molecules play in host tissue invasion, degradation and/or digestion  <cit> . in particular, a cysteine protease  was amongst the c. elegans orthologues of xl3-specific molecules in h. contortus . this finding is supported by previous evidence, showing that cysteine proteases play a crucial role in the catabolism of globin peptides by the cleavage of haemoglobin in blood-feeding nematodes   <cit> . given this role, these proteases have been considered as promising candidates for developing recombinant vaccines against h. contortus as well as hookworms  <cit> . typically, these proteases include a 'globin domain' that protects the haeme iron from rapid oxidation and regulates oxygen homoeostasis  <cit>  in the gut of the host, which is characterized by a reduced oxygen tension  <cit> . indeed, this domain  was identified as the most abundant motif amongst the xl3-specific molecules. in h. contortus, transcripts encoding cathepsin b cysteine protease-like  proteins have been reported to be most abundant  in the intestine of the adult female  <cit> . in addition, a comparison of h. contortus isolates from europe and north america has revealed a minor to moderate nucleotide diversity in cbl genes, which has been proposed to reflect antigenic variation among cbls  <cit> . clearly, c. elegans provides a useful surrogate system  <cit>  to express h. contortus cysteine-proteases and to assess their function.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study has provided new and exciting insights into the molecular biology of the l <dig> stage of h. contortus and has elucidated transcriptional alterations taking place during the transition from the free-living to the parasitic stage of this nematode. although approximately half of the sequences generated by  <dig> sequencing remains uncharacterised, as a consequence of the absence of complete genomic information for this parasite, future sequencing efforts using, for example, illumina technology, should provide the efficiency and depth of coverage required to define the complete transcriptomes of all developmental stages and various tissues as well as the genome of h. contortus. the determination of the genome sequence of h. contortus has major potential to accelerate large-scale studies of genes and gene products involved in nematode development and reproduction, parasite-host interactions and the disease caused by the parasite. importantly, comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic data will also underpin future proteomic and metabolomic studies of h. contortus. such an integrated approach should lead to important conceptual advances in our understanding of various aspects of nematode biology and should have major implications, in the medium to long term, for the development of novel strategies for parasite intervention, resulting in biotechnological outcomes . for instance, future work could focus on defining a spectrum of key molecules involved in pathways linked to the development of the nervous system in different stages of h. contortus and assessing their potential as drug targets. moreover, determining the structure and function of scp/taps homologues/orthologues could establish their role in the invasion of and establishment of this parasite in the host animal, providing the prospect of interfering with the host-parasite relationship. although the present study focused on h. contortus, the research findings and the integrated technological approach employed should find broad applicability to other parasitic nematode of major global importance.
