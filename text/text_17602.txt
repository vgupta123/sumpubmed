BACKGROUND
the genus streptococcus consists of gram-positive cocci that are divided into sub-groups via numerous biochemical and molecular methods. the majority of streptococcus species can be divided into either β-hemolytic causing complete zones of lysis on blood agar plates or α-hemolytic, formation of green zones due to oxidation of hemoglobin by hydrogen peroxide to form a green methemoglobin. lancefield typing  provides groupings that do not necessarily follow recognized species. the most clinically important are s. pyogenes known as lancefield group a streptococcus , s. agalactiae lancefield group b streptococcus , lancefield group o  and the variable lancefield group species belonging to the streptococcus anginosus group  that include non-typeable  as well as strains that are lancefield group c, f and g. the majority of α-hemolytic streptococci are non-pyogenic including the viridans group streptococcus , mutans, and s. suis, which is a species that has not been assigned to a group  <cit> . vgs are considered to be part of the normal microbiota in the human oropharyngeal, urogenital and gastrointestinal tracts  <cit> . many of the vgs are classified as α-hemolytic based on their activity on standard sheep’s blood agar. however, some strains can be β-hemolytic, including s. anginosus and s. constellatus that show beta-hemolytic activity and have been shown to produce a streptolysin s-like protein  <cit> . s. intermedius produces beta-hemolysis on human blood due to a human specific hemolysin called intermedilysin  <cit>  and may also be beta-hemolytic on sheep blood agar. many other vgs behave similarly and also show β-hemolytic activity under anaerobic conditions, but not aerobically under which these assays are usually conducted .

the taxonomic grouping of the sag has historically been debated and the definitions have ranged from that of one to three species   <cit> . the validity of s. anginosus , s. intermedius  and s. constellatus  as individual species has been addressed through phenotypic analysis, dna: dna hybridization studies and genetic characterization, and currently there is little debate that there are at least three distinct species with additional subspecies  <cit> . a recent study has elucidated that sag consist of  <dig> species with s. constellatus divided into  <dig> subspecies , subsp pharyngis  and subsp viborgensis) and s. anginosus divided into  <dig> subspecies , based on the use of seven core housekeeping genes  <cit> . the sag are phenotypically diverse but most strains share common characteristics such as slow growth rate, distinctive ‘caramel smell’, ability to hydrolyze arginine, acetoin production from glucose, and an inability to ferment sorbitol  <cit> . lancefield sero-grouping is variable with sa lancefield types of a, c, f or g, while sc is typically lancefield c, f or no antigen, and si is generally not typeable using the lancefield method. almost half of all human sag clinical isolates are lancefield f type  <cit> . due to this phenotypic variability, molecular methods must be used for proper classification of sag.

the sag are part of the microbiota of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tract with variable carriage levels  <cit> . the sag are also medically important for their ability to cause suppurative infections and have been isolated from numerous body sites  <cit> . of particular interest, sag has been identified as the most common organism isolated from brain abscess  <cit> , liver abscess  <cit>  and empyema  <cit> . their capacity to elicit pulmonary exacerbation and contribute to disease pathology in cf has also been demonstrated  <cit> . however, the exact mechanism for virulence within sag has yet to be determined.

although many streptococcus species have the ability to cause disease, virulence studies within the streptococcus genus often focus on gas, gbs and s. pneumoniae <cit> . sag virulence and pathogenesis mechanisms have not yet been well studied; however, virulence mechanisms have been identified within sag that allow for the invasion of host cells, evasion of host immune activity, spreading, and allow for the colonization of host tissues to occur. intermedilysin is a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin produced by all si strains that demonstrates specificity for human erythrocytes  <cit> , and is essential for invasion of human cells by si  <cit> . s. constellatus and sa also exhibit the β-hemolytic phenotype on sheep’s blood agar  <cit> , this hemolytic activity has been attributed to the cytolytic factor streptolysin s-like peptides encoded by the saga gene within a sag operon  <cit> . mutation to the luxs gene has also been shown to decrease hemolytic activity in si  <cit> . capsules allow evasion of the host immune system and encapsulated sag strains have been isolated having a greater virulence potential than non-encapsulated strains  <cit> . they are more likely to cause larger abscesses, earlier spontaneous drainage and death in mice compared to non-encapsulated strains  <cit> . hyaluronan  is a major component of the extra cellular matrix of human connective tissue and is expressed by many cell types  <cit> . ha up regulates the hyl gene increasing sag spreading and colonization within the host  <cit> . most sag isolates have both hyaluronidase and chondroitin sulfatase activity  <cit> . a detailed analysis of sag virulence targets are required to achieve a firm understanding for the overall virulence potential within sag.

the number of sequenced bacterial genomes has exploded with the advent of new sequencing technologies, which has allowed for comparative genomic analysis. using roche gs <dig> and illumina technologies, we have sequenced to closure and, sequence polished and fully annotated seven sag genomes including representatives of each species. with the abundance of sequenced strains within the streptococcus genus, we conducted a detailed comparative analysis utilizing  <dig> streptococcal genomes including representatives from sag, mitis, pyogenic, salivarius, bovis, mutans groups and s. suis strains. such genomic comparisons allowed for detailed characterization with insights gained into sag phylogenomics, core genome, virulence potential, horizontally transferred genetic material, and microevolution within the host.

RESULTS
an introduction to the sag genome structure
the sag strains were chosen for study based on being the numerically dominant bacterial isolate cultured during cf pulmonary exacerbation or primary culture from an invasive infection . all strains were sequenced using roche gs <dig> and illumina sequencing technologies. the sequence coverage for each genome can be observed in additional file  <dig>  all seven genomes were sequenced to full closure with additional sanger and illumina sequence polishing to correct sequence errors and false pseudogenes. polishing was used to correct homopolymer base-calling errors known to occur with the gs <dig> pyrosequencing reactions. illumina sequencing was not done for scp c <dig> as sanger sequencing was done previously to evaluate homopolymer errors and achieve genome closure.

acase history as described in parkins et al.  <cit> ; *scp c <dig> was isolated from the same individual 13 months after scp c232; nt, non-typable; na, not available for these isolates.

each finished genome of the seven in-house sequenced sag was comprised of a single circular chromosome ranging in size from  <dig>  mbp to  <dig>  mbp and is within the range of genome sizes observed for all available sequenced sag strains . a schematic view of all sequenced sag genomes, including the draft genome sequences available from ncbi are provided in figure  <dig>  with an overall sag comparison showing the pan-genome in figure 1a and a comparison of each species in figure 1b-d. the average genome size for sag is very similar to the  <dig>  mbp average among the streptococci used for this study . an overall comparison, using mauve, of the different species within sag revealed that si and sc had long stretches of synteny with regions of rearrangement. sa had a greater amount of variation, although  <dig> of the genomes were draft genomes  meaning that synteny is difficult to infer . the blast atlas comparison for figure 1b-d allows for a comparison of all strains to a reference strain for each species of sag, and reveals regions of divergence within the genomes relative to the reference strain. the general features of the sag genomes are summarized in table  <dig>  and an overall summary of all genomes used in this study with publicly available genomic sequence data . as previously identified si f <dig> was incorrectly submitted as an si and has subsequently been shown to be a scc  <cit> .

*there are no genes annotated as pseudogenes, however, there are genes that are annotated with potential sequence errors or frameshift mutations. strains that have been bolded are high quality finished genomes from this study. t: denotes reference strain, sa: streptococcus anginosus, sc: streptococcus constellatus, si: streptococcus intermedius.

the g + c content for sag strains ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % , with the overall g + c content increasing from si, sc to sa . overall the average of  <dig> % is similar to the  <dig> % average g + c content for all streptococcus strains analyzed . none of the sag strains contained plasmid dna similar to other streptococcus <cit> . all seven in-house sequenced sag contained four rrna operons and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> trna genes in sa, sc and si respectively, with the majority of trna genes situated around rrna operons, as seen with other sequenced streptococcus strains  <cit> . with regard to the number of trna and rrna found within the finished genomes, sag were most similar to s. mitis and s. suis <cit> , having fewer numbers of both these rna genes than streptococci in the pyogenic, mutans, bovis and salivarius groups  <cit> .

the sag strains had on average  <dig> cdss  with an average length of 934 bp, while the streptococcal average was  <dig> cdss with an average size of 893 bp. this difference in number of cdss may be due in part to the differing size of streptococci genomes, but it may also be partially due to the extra care taken to manually annotate the in-house sag genomes resulting in a higher number of pseudogenes. this has been demonstrated using s. pyogenes mgas <dig>  mgas <dig>  sf <dig> and ssi- <dig>  which in the original annotation had zero pseudogenes  <cit> , but when retrospectively examined for the presence of pseudogenes they were shown to have  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively  <cit> . the seven in-house sequenced sag genomes harbor  <dig> to  <dig> pseudogenes depending on the strain, with the most found in saw c <dig> and the least in si b <dig> . when pseudogenes are included in the total cdss, the average number of cdss increased to  <dig>  an example of how sequence errors or pseudogenes can affect the average cds size is seen in the whole-genome shotgun sequence for scp sk <dig>  this genome had an average cds size of 754 bp , however, a closer look at this genome revealed a large number of essential genes that were truncated including, parc, gyra, rpoa, uvra, dnag, dnae, and ftsa. the lack of extra genetic material as shown in figure 1a for scp sk <dig> compared to other sc strains also shows that the extra cdss are created owing to sequence errors and not novel genetic materials. in this study, even after manual sequence verification, generating high quality finished genomes, all seven in-house sequenced sag strains still contained predicted pseudogenes, defined as a full-length cds present within another sag strain from this study or genbank or another genome in genbank. this demonstrates the value of having single contig, high quality reference genomes for sag to aid in the analysis of comparative genomic studies.

accurate phylogeny of sag requires multiple genetic loci
with the increased genomic sequences available, the capacity for applying phylogenetic analysis methods has increased; however, there is urgent need to evaluate their equivalency. phylogenetic analysis using the single locus 16s rrna has historically been the primary molecular method determining species within the sag and, indeed this is how the seven in-house sequenced sag strains were originally speciated. to assess the discriminatory power of 16s rrna sequencing we compared the results to those acquired from an in-house core-snp pipeline, a multi-locus automated pipeline for phylogenomic analysis called amphora  <cit> , and two alternate single loci targets cpn <dig> and rpob. for all analysis strategies, 66-sequenced streptococcal genomes were included in the sag clustering analysis. in all iterations si, sc, and sa strains clustered together by species with one exception-sa f <dig> clustered with the sc strains when using cpn <dig> as a reference.

compared to the dendrogram constructed for 16s rrna , dendrograms of similar overall topology were acquired for all methods  ; in general the branch lengths were longer with the multi-locus approaches and a greater degree of statistical certainty was achieved. it has been suggested that rpob is a sensitive single locus method for differentiating streptococcus. housekeeping genes, such as rpob and cpn <dig> are believed to be either selectively neutral or subject to purifying selection. the rate of synonymous substitutions  should be equal to or slightly greater than the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions , giving a dn : ds ratio of less than  <dig>  the ratio of mean dn : ds per site  for rpob was found to be  <dig>  and the ratio for cpn <dig> was  <dig>  indicating purifying selection and demonstrating their suitability for use in phylogenetic analysis. our analysis revealed cpn <dig> to provide the longest branch lengths discriminating one strain from another , thus outperforming both rpob  and 16s rrna , supporting the findings of glazunova   <cit> . for all analytic approaches, except for 16s rrna, the closest related species to the sag were s. sanguinis and s. gordonii. these cluster in a tight group away from all other sequenced streptococcal strains as previously demonstrated  <cit> . schouls  have previously demonstrated that speciation based on 16s rrna is problematic given there is demonstrated lateral transfer within the sag of portions of the 16s rrna gene  <cit> ; our study supports this fundamental limitation of 16s rrna as a phylogenetic marker and demonstrates that 16s rrna has lower discriminatory power for speciation than any of the other approaches tested herein. although cpn <dig> and rpob each performed reasonably well for sag phylogenetic discrimination, we advocate that single locus results will be less reliable than results achieved with multiple genetic loci.

global ortholog analysis for sag within the genus streptococcus
a total genetic content comparison was conducted to determine the streptococcus pan- and core genomes via ortholog comparison between  <dig> streptococcus reference strains using orthomcl  <cit> . a total of  <dig> orthologous groups were identified within the  <dig> streptococcus strains, with  <dig> ortholog groups absent within sag . in a similar study using  <dig> species and  <dig> strains of streptococcus,  <dig> orthologous groups were identified with  <dig> absent within the s. dysgalactiae group  <cit> . the differences in numbers are due to an increased number of species  and strains  used in the present study, which is the largest study of this type done for streptococcus. the streptococcus pan-genome increases by an average of  <dig> genes for each of the  <dig> additional strains used  <cit> . most genes are from the five new streptococcus species generated in this study. this shows that the streptococcus pan-genome should still be considered ‘open’ with new genes added with additional genomes analyzed.

the core genome of streptococcus contains  <dig> genes, accounting for  <dig> %  × 100) of the streptococcus genome. previous analysis suggests that the core genome should account for >25% of the average genome  <cit> . the core genome common to all seven in-house sequenced sag was  <dig> genes , and decreased to  <dig> when the  <dig> sag draft genomes  available in genbank are added to the analysis . the three comparator groups of pyogenic streptococcus including group a streptococcus , group b streptococcus  and group c streptococcus  have  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> core genes respectively  <cit> . the s. dysgalactiae group has  <dig> genes common to both s. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis <cit> . the average core genome percentage for sag is lower than other groups at only  <dig> % , however, it is more than the 60% threshold suggested as a limit for core genomes within streptococcal groups  <cit> . the majority of groups analyzed were for a single species rather than multiple species as done for sag.

comparison of individual species within sag revealed that sc had the most core genes  followed by sa  and si , this is consistent with other species of streptococcus; s. thermophilus   <cit> ; s. pneumoniae   <cit> ; and s. agalactiae   <cit> . within sag the average percentage of core genes is  <dig> % for sc,  <dig> % for sa and  <dig> % for si. the values for sag are similar to those found for other streptococcus species including s. pyogenes , s. agalactiae  and s. thermophilus   <cit> .

extended analysis demonstrates that sag shares the most core genes with s. gordonii and s. sanguinis . s. anginosus shares a slightly greater percentage of their core genome with s. sanguinis, whereas si and sc share a very similar percentage of their core genome with both s. gordonii and s. sanguinis . the finding that s. gordonii and s. sanguinis were most closely related to the sag strains confirms previous studies  <cit> . genome comparisons also confirmed that sag shared a decreased portion of their core genome with less taxonomically related streptococcus species including s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, and s. agalactiae . the greatest numbers of orthologs from the core genome were found in s. gordonii  and s. sanguinis sk <dig> , while the fewest were found in s. pyogenes with  <dig> . this is partly due to the closer taxonomic relationship between sag, s. sanguinis and s. gordonii, however, it may also be attributed to the number of genomes used in the analysis, with groups that have a greater number of sequenced genomes having a fewer number of core gene orthologs. interestingly, s. mutans  shared more genes than some of the more closely related strains . this was also seen in a previous study that showed s. sanguinis shared more genes with s. mutans than the more closely related s. pneumoniae <cit> . the most plausible explanation is the shared ecological niche that they all inhabit, however, s. pneumoniae is known to have increased virulence relative to s. sanguinis and s. mutans.

*this table was constructed using results from orthomcl; as. gordonii analysis included  <dig> strain; bs. sanguinis analysis included  <dig> strain; cs. mitis analysis included  <dig> strain; ds. pneumoniae analysis included  <dig> strains; es. suis analysis included  <dig> strains; fs. agalactiae analysis included  <dig> strains; gs. pyogenes analysis included  <dig> strains; hs. mutans analysis included  <dig> strains.

differences in protein functional classifications within sag
protein functions for the ortholog groups  were analyzed observing cog superfamily protein for all  <dig> streptococcus reference strains this revealed that all strains had a similar distribution of proteins within the cog categories . indeed previous studies have revealed the majority of streptococcus strains have a similar percentage of their genome dedicated to each cog category  <cit> . analysis of the total predicted coding orfs shows that approximately 68%  of all proteins in sag code for a characterized protein from the cog superfamily of proteins, except for in scp sk <dig> , which has only 51% of its proteins hitting to characterized proteins. focusing on the most closely related strains to sag reveals that s. gordonii and s. sanguinis, both have approximately 68% of their genomes coding for characterized cog superfamily proteins .

comparing sag to s. gordonii and s. sanguinis there are only a few noticeable differences in the number of proteins within different cog categories . within sa there is an increase of replication, recombination, and repair proteins for saw c <dig>  and saw ccug <dig> , compared to an average of  <dig> for the other strains in figure 4b. this difference is likely due to the increase in phage-related proteins within a recently identified saw subspecies, which may have increased propensity for the uptake of foreign dna  as compared to saa . there is a decrease in amino acid transport and metabolism proteins , and poorly characterized protein  in sag  compared to s. gordonii  and s. sanguinis . some of these differences are due to the size of the genomes, as the genomes for both s. gordonii and s. sanguinis are larger than the sag genomes, accounting for some of the increase in proteins found. in s. mutans, cog groups l, e, r and s are also known to be variable within the genus, with many proteins from these groups present within the accessory genome for s. mutans <cit> . the analysis of these differences will provide insight into the species-specific characteristics for sag.

orthologs identified as sag-unique signatures
the delineation of sag as a unique group of streptococcus species relies on the presence of genomic material not present within other streptococcus species. sag-unique signatures were identified as regions conserved within sag and absent in all other streptococcus strains. a total of  <dig> ortholog groups were present in at least one strain of sag and not in any of the other streptococcus strains included in this study. small conserved regions were identified from the overall large cog figure and a drill down figure focusing on the potential unique regions within sag was created . of the 114-ortholog groups that were identified within sag, only eight unique proteins were conserved within most of the sequenced sag strains . these eight proteins had < <dig> percent identity  to anything in the ncbi protein database and < <dig> pid to any streptococcal protein . this analysis was conducted for each individual species with sa, si and sc having  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ortholog groups respectively that were unique to each species. a number of orthologs were unique to each strain of sag, however, almost all of these genes encoded for hypothetical or conserved hypothetical proteins . very few unique proteins were observed for sa and si. interestingly, the unique genes for sc had a g + c content of  <dig> %, which is lower than the average g + c content for sequenced sc strains , suggesting these genes were likely acquired via horizontal transfer. a small number of unique genes found in sag is not unexpected since a large number of streptococcus strains have been sequenced to date; further analysis of these proteins may provide specific markers for detection or typing assays.

*genes found in all sequenced sag from genbank and this study. as. constellatus subsp. pharyngis c <dig> was used as reference for all sag strains; blength of protein within sag strains in amino acids; ccog number generated during orthomcl analysis; dpercent coverage of protein from sag compared to best match in ncbi database using blastp; epid is equal to the percent aa identity for the best match using blastp from ncbi ; forganisms with best protein match to a non-sag strain from ncbi database using blastp.

sag virulence factor repertoire identified for future pathogenomics investigations
owing to a paucity of genome and experimental data, limited virulence traits have been previously identified for the sag, and studies to date have focused on specific virulence traits and not their global virulence potential  <cit> . the curated genomic sequence data sets herein provide the opportunity for in silico ortholog gene searches to identify potential virulence traits within sag. a custom virulence database  constructed for this study contains  <dig> known or putative virulence factors from the genus streptococcus . virdb was used to query all sequenced streptococcus strains  to identify virulence genes within the streptococcus pan-genome . a more detailed analysis of the putative virulence genes within s. gordonii and s. sanguinis is also presented . there are  <dig> virulence proteins identified within sag that had greater than  <dig> pid over at least 50% of the protein when compared to this virulence database . the importance of using these respective cut-offs was to limit the over-inference of short domains or incomplete proteins in our analysis. overall, there were  <dig> known streptococcus virulence proteins conserved within the sequenced sag strains and each individual sag strain contained  <dig> to  <dig> virulence proteins. the breakdown of virulence gene by sag species was 30– <dig> , 30– <dig>  and 27– <dig> . the overall division of virulence traits showed that si and sc share greater than half of their virulence traits, although the overall repertoire of virulence traits differed between the two species. there was less conservation of virulence traits among the seven strains of sa, with some strains showing greater similarity to either sc or si for their overall virulence gene composition . although the phylogenetic groupings in this study are from our core-snp method, the examination of the genes reveals the same similarities mentioned above.

five of the  <dig> virulence proteins newly identified within sag are inferred to be adhesion proteins including: a fibronectin binding protein , important in adhesion for s. gordonii <cit> , a s. pneumoniae and s. mitis surface adhesion protein   <cit> , a laminin-binding protein important for adherence in gbs  <cit> , pullulanase protein important in streptococcus adhesion  <cit>  and streptococcus enolase a strong plasminogen-binding protein  <cit> .

twelve loci involved in invasion or evasion from host proteins were also identified in sag. all five proteins encoded for by the streptococcus invasion locus sila to sile  <cit> , four capsule proteins  from s. pneumoniae <cit> , hemolysin proteins from the s. agalactiae hemolysin loci cylz and cylg  <cit> , and udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase protein   <cit> , were present in the conserved sag virulence proteins. finally, three regulator function proteins were present, including a two component response regulator csrr , known to regulate expression of extracellular carbohydrates in streptococcus <cit> ; a protein with homology to salivaricin-a , a bacteriocin known to inhibit growth of streptococci  <cit> ; and gapdh an immunomodulatory protein important in streptococcal colonization  <cit> .

some virulence proteins were present in more than one species of sag revealing that the sag virulence repertoire may vary with strain. homologs for s. pneumoniae polysaccharide capsule operon   <cit> ; four proteins from the hemolysin complex from s. agalactiae   <cit>  and a s. pneumoniae surface-expressed adhesion protein   <cit>  were found in si, scc and some sa. interestingly only some sa  and scp contained homologs to saga through sagi that form the streptolysin s cytolytic toxin complex of gas. streptolysin s is a strong cytolytic toxin that provides the ability for transepithelial migration  <cit>  and saga homologs have recently been shown to confer β-hemolytic activity in sa  <cit> . the cytolytic function can be detected via β-hemolysis on sheep’s blood agar plates. strains predicted to be β-hemolytic based on genomic analysis  were congruent with β-hemolytic phenotype observed on sheep blood .

there was also a homolog present in sag to a hyaluronidase precursor protein  that provides the ability to survive on host hyaluronic acid as a sole carbon source, as well as aiding in bacterial spreading by allowing for detachment from biofilms  <cit> . this gene was found in all sc and si strains and saw strains, and the presence of the hyla protein was confirmed through traditional phenotypic growth testing for in house sequenced sag strains  <cit> .

internalin a  is a major invasion protein from listeria monocytogenes that mediates the attachment and invasion of hepatocytes by l. monocytogenes and is encoded by the inla gene  <cit> . a homolog to this gene has been found in streptococcus spp. and was termed the streptococcal leucine-rich  protein  <cit> . a homolog to this protein was identified in all scp, si and some sa , and is highly conserved within sag having  <dig> % nucleotide identity and  <dig>  pid. internalin a orthologs have also been identified in many other sequenced streptococcal species including s. sanguinis vmc <dig> , s. pyogenes mgas <dig>  and s. agalactiae 2603 v/r . within sequenced s. sanguinis, inla is found inserted between pyrr and a hypothetical protein, while in s. pyogenes this gene is located between metk and bira and in s. agalactiae it is located between lepa and a histidine diad domain protein encoding gene. the region around the inla gene is conserved in all sag, with inla inserted between pyrr and a conserved hypothetical protein as previously seen in s. sanguinis. in sag without inla, the pyrr and the gene encoding the conserved hypothetical protein are present, thus it appears that the inla was lost or never integrated into some sa and scc. in s. gordonii , sa 62cv  and sc sk <dig> , there are remnants of a leucine-rich protein that has been truncated located next to pyrr, which shows that inla has been gained and lost in some streptococcus strains. it has been shown in l. monocytogenes that loss or truncation of the inla gene causes decreased invasive ability  <cit> . similar results were shown for slr, where an isogenic gas strain lacking slr was significantly less virulent in a mouse model and more susceptible to phagocytosis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes  <cit> .

two virulence genes were identified in si that were not found in any of the other sag. both genes have been previously identified including; nana, a sialidase a precursor that may influence host bacterial interactions  <cit> , a pneumolysin-like protein , identified as intermedilysin, which is a human erythrocyte specific cytotoxin  <cit> . there were no virulence traits found to be specific to either sc or sa. indeed, the use of virdb has identified numerous virulence genes within sag that may allow sag to adhere, invade and spread within the host.

evaluation of colonization potential: a genetic look at sag lpxtg proteins
bacterial attachment to host cells is essential in host colonization. colonization occurs through interactions between bacterial surface-exposed proteins and host cell receptors  <cit> . one of the most common motifs found in bacterial cell surface-exposed proteins is the lpxtg motif. the motif anchors the c-terminus of these externally facing surface fibrillar proteins  <cit> . these lpxtg motif proteins are covalently attached to the cell wall by sortases, with sortase a  being the most common within streptococci  <cit> . many lpxtg motif proteins have been associated with virulence in gram-positive microorganisms, however many also have no known associated function  <cit> . each sag strain had at least one srta sortase ortholog, with all si having two srtc orthologs. sa f <dig> is the only sa strain to have multiple sortases, with a srta and two srtc orthologs. increased sortase function may increase virulence potential through assembly of surface structures  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> lpxtg motif proteins were identified within sag, however, only  <dig> of these proteins had a signal peptidase in addition to the lpxtg motif to allow expression on the cell surface. the number of lpxtg motif proteins in sag strains was in the mid range for streptococcus spp. ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . sa had the most lpxtg motif proteins with  <dig> and  <dig> for saw c <dig> and c <dig> respectively, while sc and si ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . one lpxtg motif protein, hyaluronate lyase precursor protein  was found in all si, sc and saw strains. this protein is known to be an important virulence factor as discussed above. twelve of the lpxtg motif proteins had collagen-binding domains, the same number found in s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus <cit> , and thus could be involved in sag virulence. also identified were eight proteins important as either pili or in fibrinogen-binding. the presence of numerous potential adherence proteins is common for oral microbiota, and thus, high numbers of these proteins within sag is not unexpected.

genetic analysis of two component  systems 
bacterial survival is dependent on a pathogen’s capacity to sense and respond to their environment. two-component histidine kinase systems  have been shown to play vital roles in virulence as well as the ability to respond to specific environmental signals  <cit> . in total there were  <dig> tcs found in sag,  <dig> of which were conserved in all sag strains, although the response regulator  for sagtcs <dig> is truncated in saw c <dig> and the sagtcs <dig> histidine kinase  is truncated in scp strains. s. intermedius and saw had the most tcs with  <dig>  while scp had the least with  <dig> . these numbers are similar to other sequenced streptococcus strains including:  <dig> in s. sanguinis <cit> ,  <dig> in s. pneumoniae <cit> ,  <dig> in s. mutans <cit> ,  <dig> in s. pyogenes <cit>  and  <dig> in s. agalactiae <cit> .

1two component system histidine kinases systems found in sag; 2the equivalent tcs found in s. pneumoniae as reviewed by paterson et al.  <cit>  , sag orthologs found using blast hits from ncbi; 3all sagtcs present in more than one sag are listed using the loci from histidine kinase from si b <dig> since this strain had the most tcs orthologs.; 4pid is equal to the percent aa identity for the best match using blastp from ncbi ; and; no data for this hk, bsa = s. anginosus, csi = s. intermedius, dscc = s. constellatus subsp. constellatus.

thirteen of the  <dig> tcs found in sag were found to have orthologs in other species of streptococcus including nine orthologs to tcs that have been linked to virulence in s. pneumoniae <cit> . of these nine, four are well characterized, including vicrk, ciarh, comde, and blpr . these tcs are important to s. pneumoniae virulence, quorum sensing, competence, bacteriocin production, and stress response  <cit> . four additional sag tcs  show homology to less characterized tcs that are also important for virulence in s. pneumoniae  <cit> . another tcs sequence  is poorly characterized showing the most similarity to a characterized tcs from s. mutans <cit> . sagtcs <dig> has been disrupted in scp and sa except sk52t, ccug <dig> and c <dig>  to leave only a truncated portion of the hk with an absent cognate rr. this truncation appears to be due to the insertion of the sag operon within these strains of sag, as a complete hk/rr system is observed in all strains that lack the sag operon; the importance of this tcs has not been well characterized  <cit> . finally sagtcs <dig> was only found in sa c <dig>  62cv and sk52t, with homology to uncharacterized tcs from s. oralis, s. mutans, s. macacae and lactobacillus salivarius. the importance of tcs in many aspects of virulence is well known and shows the virulence potential for sag, however, more work is required to fully characterize tcs within sag.

potential natural immunity conveyed by clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  within sag
clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  contribute to bacterial immunity to invasion from foreign dna such as bacteriophage and plasmid dna  <cit> . crispr analysis in sag strains showed that seven of the  <dig> strains analyzed contained crisprs . three of the seven strains had more than one crispr for a total of  <dig> crisprs identified within sag . based on the cas <dig> protein all crisprs except for one that had a cas <dig> protein were of the crispr subtype ii-a also known as the nmeni subtype  <cit> .

the crisprs sintb196- <dig>  sang62- <dig> and sang1051- <dig> were closely related to each other based on cas <dig> aa identity and are all inserted between a transcriptional regulator  and a conserved hypothetical protein . crisprs sconsk53- <dig>  sangsk52- <dig>  sangsk1138- <dig> and f0211- <dig> and f0211- <dig> were also similar to each other based on cas <dig> aa identity. f0211- <dig> and f0211- <dig> may be part of the same crispr as inferred from their location within the genome; however, as this strain is only publically available as a draft wgs project data set, this inference cannot be confirmed. gene composition was the same for all three crispr elements including known crispr associated proteins cas <dig> , cas <dig>  cas <dig> and csn <dig> followed by the crispr direct repeat  and spacer regions . this genetic arrangement and blast results suggests that this crispr is most closely related to the crispr subtype ii-a family. crisprs with similar genetic content have been identified within s. thermophilus, s. gordonii, s. suis and s. infantarius <cit> . the dr length was  <dig> to 36 bp for all three strains , while there was variation in the number of spacers present within each crispr . the dr regions were similar for all subtype ii-a crispr elements within sag with the last repeat showing variation as has been shown for other crispr elements  <cit> .

the crispr sconsk53- <dig> was the only non type ii-a crispr , which is located next to an integrase and is composed of cas <dig>  cas <dig>  cas <dig>  cas <dig>  cas <dig>  cas <dig> and cas <dig> genes from 5′ to 3′ and followed by a crispr region with a dr of 32 bp and  <dig> spacers . this type of crispr has been previously identified within streptococcus <cit> , and showed the most similarity to crispr-associated loci from s. sanguinis, s. mutans, s. parasanguinis, and s. pyogenes. the localization next to an integrase gene and high similarity  to a similar region within s. mutans lj <dig> , while the surrounding area shows less similarity  suggests that this region was horizontally transferred into scc sk53t.

s. anginosus c <dig> had a total of three crispr regions, with sang1051- <dig> and sang1051- <dig> both appearing to be degenerate. sang1051- <dig> has cas <dig> and cas <dig> genes and the crispr region with  <dig> dr of  <dig> bases in length , similar to sthe2c from s. thermophilus lmd- <dig>  <cit> , however, compared to other cas <dig> proteins there is less than 65% aa identity as compared to all other cas <dig> proteins that have matches greater than 90% based on aa identity. the third crispr region, sang1051- <dig>  had three spacers of  <dig> bases . although neither crispr- <dig> nor crispr- <dig> had a full complement of crispr-associated proteins, the fact the crispr- <dig> had  <dig> spacers suggests that this crispr may still be functional  <cit> . s. anginosus c <dig> and si b <dig> did not have any detectable prophage integrated into their genomes. this may be due to the presence of multiple crispr elements within these genomes.

for the  <dig> crisprs described above, there were a total of  <dig> spacers . of these  <dig> a total of  <dig> had greater than 80% identity over 50% of their sequence to a sequence in genbank. however, none of the spacers from sag showed 100% dna identity to anything in the ncbi nucleotide database, which is significant as it has been shown that 100% match is required for immunity to foreign dna  <cit> . a total of  <dig> spacers showed >90% nucleotide similarity to previously identified streptococcal-specific phages including five phages from s. pneumoniae;  <dig>   <dig>  v <dig>  <cit> , cp- <dig>  <cit>  and ej- <dig>  <cit> ; two phages from s. pyogenes, phi <dig>   <cit> , and phinih <dig>  <cit> ; streptococcus phage c <dig> isolated from group c streptococcus <cit> ; s. oralis phage ph <dig>  <cit> ; s. gordonii phage ph <dig>  <cit> ; and a phage from s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus ucn <dig>  <cit> ; . all spacers were unique except for  <dig> spacers from sa f <dig>  this one spacer was located within each of the three crisprs identified for sa f <dig>  these spacers were similar to an integrative conjugative element  from vibrio fluvialis ind <dig>  and showed similarity to genes encoding for pili and conjugative machinery. it appears that f <dig> had multiple encounters with one or multiple conjugative elements similar to icevflind <dig> and has acquired a means to prevent integration of this type of ice. perhaps crisprs have played a role in the evolution of sag and may be responsible for the lack of foreign genetic material seen in some in-house sequenced sag strains. we are currently investigating whether sag crisprs might be variable enough to be useful in a subtyping scheme.

extensive horizontal gene transfer and accessory gene content in sag
none of the sag strains sequenced in this study possessed extracellular plasmids, which would indicate that this is not a common method of hgt among sag strains; although loss of plasmid on in vitro culture is not uncommon and cannot be completely ruled out. this was shown in a previous study where only two plasmids were identified within  <dig> strains of sag  <cit> . however, all strains from this study showed evidence of hgt via presence of prophage, insertion sequences, transposons and ices and those account for  <dig> to  <dig> % of the total predicted coding sequences within the seven genomes sequenced for this study . the prophage and ices identified within this study are highlighted in figure 1b-d and can be seen in the mauve analysis also . these sag mobile elements will be described in detail elsewhere .

investigation of sag natural competence
uptake of naked dna from the environment, known as natural competence, allows bacteria to survive and thrive in variable environmental conditions. natural competence has been studied in-depth for the streptococci with s. pneumoniae serving as the model organism  <cit> . the complexity of natural competence systems and diversity of streptococcal competence genes has made in-silico prediction of natural competence difficult  <cit> . genome transcriptomics and tiling microarrays have shown that there are  <dig> essential genes required for natural transformation in s. pneumoniae <cit> . orthologs to  <dig> of the essential competence genes were identified in all seven in-house sequenced sag . for all remaining wgs strains, there were truncated or absent genes likely owing to sequence errors; however, this would have to be experimentally confirmed. the only homolog absent in all strains was comw, which is also missing in the naturally competent s. zooepidemicus <cit> , s. sanguinis <cit>  and s. mutans <cit>  suggesting that it may not be absolutely required for natural competence.

all scp examined to date  are not naturally competent, but competence has been shown in si . sequence analysis has revealed that the lack of natural competence in sc may be due to an insertion within comea gene. this truncation results in a gene product approximately half that of the original comea and when this gene is inactivated in s. pneumoniae, competence is abrogated  <cit> . the detected insertion has been experimentally validated using sanger sequencing. all scp strains had a nine nt in-frame deletion in the comd gene. this has been found to be a feature of all scp , but does produce a functional comd . the only other difference seen in the complement of competence genes within sag was the number of comx orthologs. for most streptococcus strains there are two comx orthologs , for the sag there were three comx loci in most strains. however, one copy of comx was truncated in scp c <dig>  and in some of the publicaly available wgs strains included in our analysis . further functional studies will have to be completed in sag to identify and characterize which competence proteins are essential.

microevolution within sag
two strains  that were sequenced within this study were cultured from the same individual almost one year apart. these isolates were both the numerically dominant strain present during a pulmonary exacerbation. genomic comparisons revealed that these strains were almost identical, differing by only  <dig> snps . the snps were found within intergenic regions , and causing both synonymous  and non-synonymous mutations . two of the non-synonymous mutations introduced stop codons, resulting in two truncated genes within scp c818; one is a putative abc transporter  while the other is a 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase . mutations in arod have been extensively characterized in salmonella typhi <cit>  and have been shown to render bacteria auxotrophic for aromatic amino acids p-aminobenzoate  and  <dig>  3-dihydroxybenzoate. this results in the inability to produce ubiqinone and menaquinone causing cellular respiration defects  <cit> , as well as defects in the cell envelope  <cit> . indeed, it has been shown that aromatic amino acids are abundant within the sputum produced within the lungs of cf lung patients and thus may provide an adequate source of these essential nutrients  <cit> . further studies will be required to determine the importance of this arod mutation within scp c <dig>  two snps were located within a region of the rpob gene known to cause rifampicin resistance  <cit> . finally, a second type of divergence between scp c <dig> and c <dig> were tandem repeat and microsatellite regions, which are potential targets for multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis . there were a total of five regions of increased/decreased copies of tandem repeats ranging in size from four to  <dig> nt . of these five regions, three are located in truncated genes, whereas the other two were within non-coding regions. further analysis into potential mlva targets within sag is warranted. although both these strains are highly similar, appreciating the evolution that occurred during a year in a cf lung is critical to understanding the fitness advantage required for chronic bacterial pathogens.

CONCLUSIONS
this study presented the analysis and comparison of the whole-genome sequences for the three species within sag, important pathogens with the capacity to cause serious infections throughout the body. sequencing strains from both respiratory and invasive infections, we identified no clear differences in gene content between these types of isolates, suggesting that it may be host factors that promote certain types of infection as opposed to bacteria-specific virulence factors. there were only eight genes detected that were uniquely common to all seven in-house sequenced sag; these were also found in most sag draft genomes that are currently publically available. the comparison of sc, si and sa strains revealed significant differences with respect to virulence factors, surface proteins and carriage of horizontal genetic elements, with sa showing the most intra-species variability. horizontal gene transfer between sag and other pathogens within their environment has clearly played a significant role in the evolution of species within sag, which will need to be studied in far greater detail. the detailed comparison of microevolution within sag has identified potential targets for molecular typing methods as well as potential research questions regarding survival of a bacterial pathogen within the lung of a cf patient. the generation of our high quality finished reference genomes for the seven in-house sequenced sag strains will provide a valuable resource for the analysis of future sag draft genomes. this comparative genomic analysis provides a key genetic framework for assessing and understanding the molecular events contributing to sag pathogenesis.
