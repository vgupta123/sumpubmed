BACKGROUND
most cancers occur as a result of changes in the genome of somatic cells. while such changes often have no effect, some alterations in combination with the environment of the cells that harbor them, conspire to initiate and maintain a tumorigenic process resulting in abnormal cell proliferation. discovering the genomic lesions contributing to tumor initiation and progression will provide a more profound understanding of the biology of cancer, new prognostic markers, and hopefully novel therapeutic targets. our improved understanding of cancer genetics is the result of the revolution in experimental tools available to make observations at different dimensions and scales. large scale projects, such as the cancer genome atlas  or the international cancer genome consortium   <cit>  aim to provide a comprehensive characterization of nearly  <dig> tumor types. these projects collect large numbers of tumor samples, providing information on clinical and high throughput biological data, including mrna and small rna expression, point mutations, methylation, and copy number copy number  alterations. recently, many studies have reported recurrent genetic alterations in a variety of tumors by analyzing high throughput data in large panels of tumor samples .

although we can observe a cancer genome at nucleotide resolution with high throughput sequencing, the impact of particular alterations is not clear. the ultimate answer can only be obtained from a detailed functional analysis of the biological consequences of the mutations. unfortunately, this is a laborious process and the complexity of the mutational landscape makes impossible to assess the impact of all reported alterations. thus it is desirable to prioritize the mutations identified with sequencing analysis in order to guide the subsequent functional validation. one can heuristically predict the impact of gene mutations, such as nonsense mutations and frameshift indels, on the structure of the protein product using indicators of selection pressure such as dn/ds test. alternatively, one can rely on the statistical likelihood of mutational recurrence across many different samples. it is expected that driver genes with a significant contribution to the etiology of a particular cancer type will be altered repeatedly across many different samples in proportion significantly higher than passenger mutations.

several approaches have been proposed to identify the most relevant recurrent alterations across a large number of tumor samples. gistic  <cit>   aims to identify significant chromosomal aberrations in tumors by studying alterations in large collections of copy number data. the method identifies genomic regions that present more aberrations in tumors than random. other groups  <cit>  have proposed to combine copy number data with expression data to pinpoint driver genes within regions of frequent chromosome aberrations. in  <cit>  we proposed a heuristic measure of focality as a way of identifying focal alterations in copy number data. a problem with copy number analysis is that often the genomic alterations are not sufficiently focal to identify the genes that are the target of a particular genomic lesion, as opposed to those alterations that are there by chance only. a direct solution to the lack of specificity in copy number analysis is provided by high throughput sequencing technologies, which have been the object of many exciting developments in the last decade, providing a read-out of the cancer genome at nucleotide level.

in this work we propose a framework, mutcomfocal, for assessing the importance of genes using sequencing and copy number data from multiple samples of the same cancer type. the method formalizes in a bayesian framework a previous heuristic idea  <cit>  used to identify focal copy number aberrations. the measure proposed here takes into account the recurrence of altered genes as well as the size of the lesions. genes are scored separately for deletions and gains, with the assumption that genes with high cn gain score will tend to be oncogenes, while those with high deletion score will tend to be tumor suppressors. in this way, focality of the lesions altering a particular region is not inferred entirely from the recurrence of alterations to genes in that region, but includes also the size of the lesions covering it. as a test of the applicability of the method we use several datasets from studies with non-overlapping samples of dlbcl. in each case, the method confirms the genes that were previously reported as contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease and identifies some new targets.

RESULTS
focality and recurrence from copy number data and mutations
the method is based on two measures of the significance of each gene : a focality score and a recurrence score. both scores are computed separately for cn gains and deletions. first, for a fixed sample each of the measures assigns a score to every gene. the focality score of a gene in a fixed sample is d/l, where d is the amplitude , and l is the length of that lesion, in terms of the number of genes contained. for example, in an autosomal chromosome a loss of two copies has deviation d =  <dig>  a loss of one copy has d =  <dig>  a gain of one copy has d =  <dig>  etc. the recurrence score of a gene in a sample is d/t, where d is the amplitude of the lesion covering the gene and t is the sum of the deviations of the genes altered in the sample. next, the scores for each gene are summed across the samples and normalized across the genes to sum to  <dig>  the focality and recurrence scores are combined into a single score by multiplication and then normalization to  <dig>  the combined score forms a distribution over the genes and, as explained in the methods, genes are divided into tiers using the entropy function. the scores are formally introduced within the bayesian framework in the methods section. the main quantity to be computed is the probability that a gene is a driver given a set of alterations.

while cnvs provide information on genomic lesions spanning several genes, point mutations provide more specific information on single genes. to integrate mutations, we devise a method that considers both mutations and copy number alterations within the same framework . we first compute a mutation score in a manner analogous to computing the recurrence score by considering mutated genes to participate in single gene lesions. more precisely, in a fixed sample which has n mutated genes, each mutated gene receives a sample mutation score of 1/n. the mutation scores are obtained by adding sample mutation scores over all samples followed by normalization to  <dig>  the mutation scores are combined separately with recurrence and focality scores for cn gains and deletions to obtain the gain/mutation and deletion/mutation scores for each gene. more precisely, for every gene, the gain/mutation score is equal to the product of the mutation score and the sum of the recurrence and focality gain scores for that gene. similarly, using recurrence and focality deletion scores, we obtain deletion/mutation scores. the gain/mutation and deletion/mutation scores are normalized to sum to  <dig> 

results in dlbcl data
we performed the mutcomfocal analysis for identifying driver genes in diffuse large b-cell lymphoma using copy-number data from  <dig> dlbcl samples  and somatic mutations data from  <dig> cases, including  <dig> samples from lohr et al.  <cit>  corresponding to  <dig> mutated genes,  <dig> samples from pasqualucci et al.   <cit> , and  <dig> samples from the morin et al. study  <cit> ; from the latter study, only mutations obtained by dna sequencing and confirmed to be somatic were selected . keeping only genes recurrently mutated resulted in  <dig> genes. genes were scored according to their copy number status from snp array analysis as explained in the methods section.

figure  <dig> represents the scores for the  <dig>  genes of the human genome on the autosomal chromosomes annotated with the names of the leaders of the top  <dig> regions. for each region, the gene with the highest score is declared a leader of the region . adding the mutation data to the copy number analysis data resulted in the scores shown in figure  <dig>  where we have listed the top  <dig> genes .

the leader genes in the top deleted regions contained genes with a known contribution to the pathogenesis of dlbcl, such as cdkn2a , b2m  <cit> , prdm <dig>  <cit> , tnfaip <dig>  <cit> , and nrxn <dig>  a gene previously noted to be altered in dlbcl  <cit> . the top genes also included some known fragile sites, as fhit in 3p <dig>   and immp2l in 7q <dig> -7q <dig>  . in addition, the method identified the pdcd1lg2/cd <dig> region  <cit> , 17p <dig> , a region that has been implicated as a tumor-suppressor region in medulloblastoma, where it is deleted in 40% of cases  <cit>  and arid1b, a member of the swi/snf chromatin remodeler complex implicated in differentiation and development  <cit> . arid1b is deleted in 24% of cases and mutated in 6% of cases.

adding the information on somatic mutations to the copy number analysis confirmed several genes obtained from copy number data only, such as b2m, nrxn <dig>  fhit, tnfaip <dig>  and arid1b. in addition, this analysis brought forth genes that have been recorded previously to contribute to dlbcl such as ciita  <cit> , crebbp  <cit> , cd <dig>  <cit>  and tp <dig>  <cit> , as well as genes that have been associated to dlbcl such as tmem30a, actb, itpkb and tbl1xr <dig>  <cit> . the analysis also singled out robo <dig>  a candidate tumor suppressor in head and neck cancer  <cit> , and msr <dig> , a gene with tumor suppressor function in leukemia stem cells of chronic myeloid leukemia  <cit> . surprisingly, card <dig> also scored high by this analysis. this observation can be attributed to the fact that the analysis does not distinguish deleterious mutations from those that confer an activating effect.

a similar analysis of cn gains produced regions encompassing known contributors to dlbcl such as pdcdlg2/cd <dig>  bcl <dig>  and myc, all of which are targeted by amplifications. the appearance of pdcdlg2/cd <dig> as a relevant target of both cn gains and losses is an indication of a more complex behavior of the region, potentially induced by a genomic translocation  <cit> . the method also identified a region containing rel  <cit>  and a region containing nfkbiz, which have been singled out previously as occurring frequently in dlbcl and studied in that context  <cit> . in addition, a region containing mdm <dig>  a gene frequently observed to be overexpressed in human tumors and contributing to tumor formation in mice by inhibiting tp <dig>  <cit> , was identified. among the top  <dig> genes obtained by integrating cn gains with somatic mutations were known dlbcl-associated oncogenes such as pim <dig>  <cit> , card <dig>  <cit> , myc, ezh <dig>  <cit> , and bcl <dig>  <cit> . in addition, the analysis identified klhl <dig> , a gene involved in bcr signaling and germinal center formation in mice  <cit> , il <dig> , a gene involved in the activation of jak/stat, pi3k/akt and mapk signaling  <cit> , and lrp <dig> , a gene promoting cancer cell invasion  <cit> .

we compared the performance of mutcomfocal with the result produced by gistic, a widely used tool for analyzing copy number data. the results of gistic in the dlbcl data are shown in the supplementary information . gistic produces two levels of q-values – one at the level of probes  and a second one at the level of peaks, which are contiguous genomic regions spanning one or more genes . we compared the analysis of mutcomfocal to both levels of q-values produced by gistic. to this end, for a particular level of q-value we sorted the genes by that q-value and selected the top  <dig> regions in the manner described above . for probe level q-values, the top  <dig> regions of gain included  <dig> genes and the top  <dig> deletion regions contained  <dig> genes;  <dig> of the top  <dig> regions of gain produced by gistic appeared also in the top  <dig> regions produced by mutcomfocal  ;  <dig> of the top  <dig> deletions regions produced by gistic, containing cdkn2a, b2m, tnfaip <dig>  prdm <dig>  arid1b, fhit, rph3al, loxl <dig>  mtap, and, c4orf <dig>  overlapped with the results of mutcomfocal . for peak level q-values, the  <dig> regions of gain contained  <dig> genes  and the  <dig> deletion regions contained  <dig> genes ;  <dig> of the  <dig> amplification peak regions produced by gistic, containing rel, bcl <dig>  pdcd1lg <dig>  il10ra, nfkbiz, myc, and nup <dig>  overlapped with mutcomfocal ;  <dig> of the  <dig> deletion peak regions produced by gistic, containing cdkn2a, prdm <dig>  tnfaip <dig>  and fhit, overlapped with mutcomfocal . in summary, the comparison of the two methods shows that at a high level they capture similar recurrent alterations. in addition, by incorporating somatic mutations mutcomfocal is able to narrow down those regions to specific genes, thus reducing significantly the number of candidate genes implicated in cancer.

CONCLUSIONS
novel driving alterations in cancer provide the opportunity for the discovery of potential molecular targets in cancer, and the identification of prognostic and diagnostic alterations. with the advent of novel high throughput technologies in biomedical research, several comprehensive molecular characterization initiatives have been put forward. at least three large consortiums, the cancer genome atlas , the international cancer genome consortium  and the nci's therapeutically applicable research to generate effective treatments  are collecting samples in hundreds of patients. as diverse high throughput data from large scale projects become available, there is a growing need of methods to  integrate and  extract the biologically relevant information. in this paper, we present a bayesian framework aiming to identify candidate genes implicated in oncogenesis combining copy number and point mutation data. mutcomfocal is a method based on the concept that small focal alterations are more informative than large chromosomal aberrations. compared to methods based only on recurrent copy number alterations, mutcomfocal is able to pinpoint candidate driver genes in regions encompassing large genomic alterations.

we have applied mutcomfocal to cnv and point mutation data in dlbcl. apart from previously reported genes, mutcomfocal has identified several potential novel genes that may be involved in dlbcl development: arid1b, robo <dig> and mrs <dig> as candidate tumor suppressors and klhl <dig>  il <dig> and lrp <dig> as candidate oncogenes. among them, arid1b is a member of the swi/snf chromatin remodeler complex and has been implicated both in transcriptional activation and repression by chromatin remodeling  <cit> . it is found deleted in  <dig> % of the samples and mutated in  <dig> %. other members of the swi/snf complex are also found mutated  and deleted  suggesting the possible involvement of the swi/snf complex in dlbcl.

the application of mutcomfocal to other tumor types is straightforward. mutcomfocal provides not only a method for integrating somatic point mutations and copy number alterations, but a general bayesian framework that can be easily extended to other types of data.
