BACKGROUND
cotton is the most important natural fiber crop which supports a multi-billion dollar production and processing industry  <cit> . the cotton genus  consists of about  <dig> diploid species belonging to eight genome groups  and  <dig> allotetraploid  species  <cit> . within the gossypium genus, two of the five tetraploid species , along with two diploid species , were independently domesticated for cotton fiber production in the last few thousand years in the new and old world  <cit> . of these four cultivated species, the tetraploid species g. hirsutum, also referred to as “upland cotton”, accounts for about 95% of the global cotton production. consequently, a great majority of world-wide cotton breeding programs have been focusing on improving upland cotton.

with the increasing global demand for textile products, intense competition from synthetic fibers, and textile industry’s modernization by shifting to high-speed spinning technologies, the need for higher yielding upland cotton cultivars with improved fiber quality has never been more critical  <cit> . however, yield increases are often negatively associated with fiber quality within upland cotton . this negative association between yield and fiber quality has hampered cotton breeding efforts for the improvement of multiple traits. it has been a cotton breeder’s high desire to effectively break this negative linkage. random mating procedures have provided an important methodology to break undesirable associations and to form new combinations in several crop plants, including tobacco  <cit> , sorghum  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , and oats  <cit> . random mating has previously been shown to reduce correlations between traits in cotton as well . random mating requires a considerable expenditure of time and energy. if one starts with a large diverse group of parental lines, it offers an opportunity to break up adverse linkage blocks and to form new recombinations, some of which should be superior.

conventional cotton breeding programs, primarily relying on crossing adapted genotypes and selecting novel allele combinations based on phenotypes, have greatly contributed to the success of the cotton industry in the past century  <cit> . however, the very complex quantitative inheritance of yield and fiber quality traits and the negative associations between them as described above require cotton breeders to develop more effective strategies in order to develop superior cultivars.

marker-assisted selection  is one such strategy that has received great attention among plant and animal breeders during the past three decades. in cotton, many reports on mapping qualitative and quantitative traits have been published . as for mapping quantitative trait loci  related to fiber quality, more than  <dig> qtls have been reported so far  . however, most of these qtls were obtained based on the analysis of interspecific  populations. these fiber qtls have very limited values in upland cotton breeding through a mas strategy because: 1) favorable qtls  from g. barbadense are often not present in g. hirsutum; 2) markers showing polymorphism between two species may be monomorphic within g. hirsutum, which in turn makes the markers not useful in upland cotton breeding; 3) transfer of favorable traits from g. barbadense to g. hirsutum via inter-mating has been very difficult, and resulted in very limited success  <cit> . in realization of these limitations, cotton scientists have been using g. hirsutum intra-specific populations to identify fiber qtls  <cit> . however, this approach faces a challenge of low intra-specific polymorphism in cotton. the average polymorphism rate between any two upland cotton cultivars used so far in a bi-parental mapping project is about 4–8% as revealed by microsatellite markers . currently, there is no a high density g. hirsutum intraspecific genetic map that covers the entire genome.

to overcome this challenge, cotton scientists used a four-way cross population  <cit>  or three-parent composite population  <cit>  to map fiber and yield qtls. the approach using populations involving more than two parents ensured greater genetic diversity and an increased polymorphism frequency in the mapping populations, and improved possibility of qtl analysis. in addition, research on association mapping agronomic trait qtls using a group of varieties has been rising in cotton  <cit> .

in this research, we first developed a recombinant inbred population of  <dig> lines that were derived from six cycles of random-mating beginning with half diallel crossing of  <dig> upland cotton cultivars, followed by six generations of self-pollination. the  <dig> recombinant inbred lines  were planted in two years to obtain fiber quality measurements. second, we screened  <dig> simple sequence repeat  markers to identify polymorphic markers among the  <dig> parents. third, we analyzed  <dig> rils  using  <dig> well-distributed ssr markers. fourth, we conducted association analysis between markers and fiber quality traits using the software package tassel  <cit>  in order to identify fiber qtls. finally, for each fiber trait, we confirmed the marker-trait associations using the other  <dig> rils  by comparing the phenotypic data of the rils that were grouped based on the genotypes of seven qtl-linked markers. the main objective of this research was to identify stable qtls related to fiber quality traits. since the  <dig> parents represent a diverse germplasm pool of the us cotton cultivars, marker-trait associations identified in this research should be very useful in upland cotton breeding aimed at improving fiber quality.

RESULTS
genetic diversity of the  <dig> parents
we screened  <dig> ssr markers for their polymorphism among the  <dig> parents . of these markers,  <dig>  were polymorphic. when comparing any two parents, the most different pair was between acala ultima and m240rnr , and the least different pair was between fm <dig> and stv <dig> . a upgma dendrogram tree that was constructed using  <dig> ssr marker data based on the dice coefficient  <cit>  is presented in additional file  <dig>  as shown in this figure, the overall genetic diversity is very low even though these  <dig> parents were selected to represent the wide spectrum of diversity within the us cotton cultivars.table  <dig>

statistics and genome distribution of  <dig> polymorphic ssr markers
of the  <dig> polymorphic markers that covered more than 80% of the tetraploid cotton genome according to the high density consensus map  <cit> , we selected  <dig> markers. these  <dig> markers revealed  <dig> codominant,  <dig> dominant and  <dig> monomorphic loci among the  <dig> parents . a total of  <dig> alleles were identified. the genomic distribution of the  <dig> selected markers is shown in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  these markers covered about 83% of the cotton genome if based on the high density consensus map  <cit> . however, if based on the g. raimondii genome sequence  <cit> , the selected markers covered  <dig> mbp which accounted for  <dig> % coverage. due to the unavailability of a genome reference sequence, we used the genetic map of tetraploid cotton as the main reference in this report. the coverage was uneven, ranging from 55% on chromosome   <dig> to 98% on chr.  <dig>  there were  <dig> gaps greater than 20 cm, and  <dig> of them occurred at the telomeric regions of  <dig> chromosomes. chr. <dig> had the least  coverage. there was a big gap of  <dig>  cm on the long arm of chr. <dig> where no single polymorphic marker was found. possible reasons for this are discussed later . alignment of the  <dig> polymorphic markers against g. raimondii reference genome sequence did not identify any markers in this region either. we also screened five  markers that were aligned to the telomeric region of g. raimondii’s chr. <dig>  based on the whole-genome marker map  <cit> , however, none was polymorphic among the  <dig> parents.table  <dig>

ril population structure assessment
the efficacy of random-mating and its effect on reducing population structure of the ril population  were assessed based on the  <dig> polymorphic ssr markers using the software structure  <dig>   <cit>  and jmp genomics  <dig>  . these markers contained  <dig> alleles . all alleles contained in the parents were observed in the rils. for any a given allele, its percentage within the ril population was almost the same as that within the  <dig> parents , implying thorough random-mating and uniform allele flow between generations. furthermore, the rils did not contain any allele that was absent in parents, indicating absence of outcrossing and successful implementation of crossing and self-pollinating. overall, the rils were very homozygous with average residual heterozygosity of  <dig> %. figure  <dig> is a heat-map generated by jmp genomics  <dig>  to show the relatedness between rils. as seen from this figure, no two rils appeared identical . examination of the raw data indicated that ril pairs with relatedness value higher than  <dig>  in the heat map were essentially absent. these results indicated that the random mating method employed in this study was very effective, and the population structure within the rils essentially did not exist. analysis of all  <dig> rils using the  <dig> markers that were used to genotype all the  <dig> rils produced the same conclusion . we also assessed the ril population structure using the software structure  <dig> , which indicated that the ril population was thoroughly random-mated, and no obvious structure was present .figure  <dig>

fiber quality measurements of parents and rils
the  <dig> parents and rils were planted in triplicates in mississippi state, ms, usa for two years .

the fiber properties of the rils and their parents are shown in table  <dig>  wide ranges for all traits were observed among the rils and transgressive segregations existed. comparisons among pearson correlation coefficients between traits of parents, and rils are shown in additional file  <dig>  the correlation coefficients were generally lower in rils than in parents, indicating that random-mating did break linkages to a certain degree. the strong positive association between elongation  and micronaire  in parents was broken in the rils, however, a significant positive association between bundle strength  and upper-half mean fiber length  was observed in the rils.table  <dig>

identification of fiber qtls
at p <  <dig>  level,  <dig> marker loci were significantly associated with fiber traits, and some of them were associated with more than one trait . when marker loci were mapped within a 5 cm interval, they were considered as a single qtl. thus a total of  <dig> qtls were identified ranging from  <dig> for short fiber content  to  <dig> for elo . as for chromosomal distribution, all  <dig> chromosomes harbored qtls ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . fifty-eight qtls were located on the at subgenome chromosomes , and  <dig> on the dt subgenome chromosomes  . a positive or negative qtl was determined based on the effects of its major allele on the trait value. if the major allele of the qtl increased a trait value, it was determined as a positive qtl. it is worth noting that a positive qtl is not necessary a favorable qtl from a breeder’s perspective for certain traits such as mic and sfc. for each trait, there were qtls that had positive or negative effects, and the qtl number of either type was similar. the phenotypic variance  explained by these qtls is listed in table  <dig>  the full detail is also shown in additional file  <dig>  following are a brief description about these qtls based on each trait.table  <dig>

elo: twenty-five qtls were identified, and located on  <dig> chromosomes . all together, the  <dig> positive qtls explained  <dig> % of the total phenotypic variance with an average of  <dig> % per qtl. the qtl on chr. <dig>  had the largest effect, and explained  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. the  <dig> negative qtls explained a combined  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance with an average of  <dig> % per qtl. the qtl on chr. <dig>  had the largest negative effect.

mic: a total of  <dig> qtls were identified, and distributed on  <dig> chromosomes. chr. <dig> had  <dig> qtls, and all were able to reduce mic value. thirteen qtls had positive effects, and explained a combined  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. the qtl on chr. <dig>  had the largest effect, and could increase the mic value by  <dig> %. there were  <dig> qtls that could reduce mic value by a total of  <dig> %. the qtl on chr. <dig>  had the largest effect, and could reduce mic value by  <dig> %.

sfc: nineteen qtls were identified, and located on  <dig> chromosomes. nine positive qtls explained a combined  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance with an average of  <dig> % per qtl. the qtl on chr. <dig>  had the largest effect, and could increase sfc value by  <dig> %. a total of  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance could be explained by the  <dig> negative qtls. the qtl on chr. <dig>  was responsible for  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance.

str: twenty qtls residing on  <dig> chromosomes were identified. ten qtls had positive effects, and explained a combined  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. the qtl on chr. <dig>  had the largest effect, and was responsible for  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. ten qtls had negative effects, and could explain  <dig> % of total phenotypic variance. one major qtl on chr. <dig>  had significant effect, and could decrease str by  <dig> %, the largest among all the qtls identified.

uhm: twenty qtls were identified, and located on  <dig> chromosomes. ten qtls each had positive and negative effects, respectively. the largest positive effect qtl was located on chr. <dig> , and could increase uhm by  <dig> %. the qtl on chr. <dig>  had the largest negative effect, and explained  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance.

ui: twenty three qtls were found as associated with ui, and resided on  <dig> chromosomes. ten qtls could increase the ui value, and had a combined effect of  <dig> % on the phenotypic variance. the qtl on chr. <dig>  had the largest effect, and was responsible for  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. thirteen qtls could reduce ui value by as much as  <dig> % if combined. the qtl on chr. <dig>  had the largest negative effect, and was responsible for  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance.

qtl clusters
of the  <dig> marker loci associated with fiber quality traits,  <dig> loci were associated with more than one trait. eighteen, thirteen, four and two were associated with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> traits, respectively . no single locus was associated with all  <dig> traits. with exception of mic which is a complex trait , the effect of each qtl cluster on the traits was usually similar. in other words, a qtl cluster that was usually able to increase the values of elo, str, uhm or ui but reduce the sfc value is considered as a favorable qtl from a breeding point of view. an unfavorable qtl cluster usually increased sfc value but decreased the values of all other four traits. it is worth mentioning that the qtl cluster on chr. <dig>  had the largest favorable breeding effects on these four traits . on the contrary, the qtl cluster on chr. <dig>  had the largest unfavorable breeding effects on sfc, str, uhm and ui.

confirmation of fiber qtls using the  <dig> rils of set 2
one hundred seventeen ssr markers that were identified as associated with fiber traits were used to genotype the  <dig> rils of set  <dig>  for each trait, we selected  <dig> markers  to group the rils into two groups: rils with  <dig> or more favorable alleles, and the remaining rils. we also did the same using all  <dig> rils . the specific markers  used for this study are listed in additional file  <dig>  by selecting favorable alleles based on the markers, the mean phenotypic value of the selected rils was significantly better  than that of non-selected rils. figure  <dig> shows the results for str using  <dig> rils of set  <dig>  or  <dig> rils . for the  <dig> rils of set  <dig>   <dig> rils containing  <dig> or more favorable alleles at the  <dig> marker loci had mean fiber bundle strength of  <dig>  g/tex, while  <dig> rils containing fewer than three favorable alleles had mean strength of  <dig>  g/tex. the difference was significant at p <  <dig> . for the whole  <dig> rils,  <dig> rils met the criterion, and their mean fiber strength was  <dig>  g/tex which was significant higher than the mean  <dig>  g/tex of the remaining  <dig> rils. similar results were obtained for the other  <dig> traits .figure  <dig>

discussion
intraspecific genetic diversity and marker coverage
although the  <dig> parental cultivars used in the present research were quite diverse in agronomic performance and breeding pedigrees, the genetic diversity among them as revealed by the  <dig> ssr markers was low. these ssr markers were developed by many groups around the world. the sources of the markers were either from genomic dna or est sequences of many genotypes  <cit> . the  <dig> ssr primer pairs used in screening were not pre-selected. and it is reasonable to believe that these markers cover the entire genome of tetraploid cotton as reported by wang et al.  <cit> . the present research further confirms that cultivated upland cotton has very narrow genetic diversity and close kinships possibly because of a few bottlenecks occurred during the domestication process as reported previously . in addition, there were  <dig> genomic regions of greater than 20 cm where no polymorphic markers were found among the  <dig> parents. these regions might indicate fixation  in the modern upland cotton, and may contain key adaptive genes which have been fixed through breeding and selection processes. the fixed homozygous genomic blocks are a great obstacle to construct a medium to high density intraspecific g. hirsutum linkage map. however, it is also likely that these regions may not contain important agronomic genes or qtls. targeted sequencing of these regions may provide better insights about their biological functions. it is worth noting that nineteen of these  <dig> genomic blocks occurred at the telomeric regions of  <dig> chromosomes. the biological implications caused by this phenomenon remain unclear, as does their impact on practical breeding. recently, gore et al.  <cit>  observed the same phenomenon when using rils derived from a cross between tm- <dig> and nm <dig>  in our previous research to fine map the ligon-lintless  <dig>  gene, we revealed a similar phenomenon  <cit> , and so did cai et al.  <cit> . chr. <dig> had a very big gap  at the end of its long arm. after examining the consensus map  <cit> , we noticed that the region between  <dig> and 230 cm was almost exclusively mapped with rflp markers. likewise, the region between  <dig> and 20 cm of chr. <dig> was also composed of rflp markers in the consensus map. it is very likely that the overall genetic distance of chr. <dig> may be not as long as 230 cm as reported by blenda et al.  <cit> . our marker coverage may be greater than 55%. in fact, our markers covered the range between  <dig>  bp and  <dig> ,467 bp of the g. raimondii chr. <dig>  , which is about  <dig> % of the entire g. raimondii chr. <dig>  <cit> . a similar situation also exists for chr. <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

fiber qtl numbers, chromosomal distribution and clustering
it is difficult to compare fiber qtl numbers between any two reports in the literature, because many factors affect qtl analysis results. these include experimental populations, population structure, environments, lod threshold or significance level, and etc.. for example, lacape et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> qtls when using lod  <dig>  however, this number was drastically reduced to  <dig> when lod  <dig>  was used. in the present research, we used p <  <dig>  as a threshold to declare that a marker was associated to a trait. using such high significance threshold would without a doubt lead to some qtls, especially those with minor effects not being identified. in fact, the combined phenotypic variance explained by the qtls reported herein was less than 90% for all six traits  although some of the phenotypic variance might be due to other reasons such as genotype × environment effects or epistasis. our objective was to identify stable qtls with moderate to major effects, and reduce the qtl number to a more manageable level from a breeder’s perspective.

the  <dig> fiber qtls identified in this research were distributed on all  <dig> chromosomes. however, the distribution was uneven with chr. <dig> harboring the greatest number of  <dig> qtls. the same result was also reported by rong et al.  <cit> . chr.  <dig> is known to be rich in fiber genes  <cit> , and harbors the n <dig> fiberless gene  <cit> . previously, rong et al.  <cit>  reported that dt subgenome chromosomes contained 25% more fiber qtls than at subgenome chromosomes. a recent meta-analysis of  <dig> fiber qtls  <cit>  indicated that 23% more fiber qtls resided on dt subgenome chromosomes. our research obtained the same conclusion showing 21% more fiber qtls residing on the dt subgenome chromosomes. both rong et al.  <cit>  and said et al.  <cit>  reports were largely based on interspecific populations while the present study focused on an intraspecific population. without a doubt, dt subgenome chromosomes play more important roles in determining fiber quality.

qtl clustering is a common phenomenon in cotton  <cit> . a recent meta-analysis of  <dig> qtls  identified  <dig> qtl clusters  <cit> . identification of qtl clusters will be useful in mas since the markers delineating these regions can be used to select several traits of interests in cotton breeding. in the present research, we identified  <dig> qtl clusters. two clusters, one on chr. <dig> and the other on chr. <dig>  were particularly interesting. the qtl cluster on chr. <dig>  had major effects to increase sfc value but decrease the values of str, uhm and ui. the qtl cluster on chr. <dig>  had reverse effects. because the directionality of the qtl effects agreed with the known phenotypic association in the parents and ril population, it remains unclear whether this is due to the pleiotropic effects of a single qtl, or due to the co-localization or co-segregation of several fiber trait specific qtls or genes. chr. <dig> and chr. <dig> are homeologous chromosomes. the chromosomal locations of these two qtls are also comparable . it is likely that they may be duplicate loci with opposite effects. because of their large effects on multiple traits, these two qtls serve as excellent candidates for mas to improve fiber quality. using our ril population as an example, if we selected for the favorable allele of the qtls on chr. <dig>  and against the deleterious allele of the qtls on chr. <dig> , the four traits  could be simultaneously improved as compared with those selected but containing deleterious alleles for both qtls . in addition, adjacent to the chr. <dig> qtl cluster, there is a qtl qelo-c16- <dig>  with a large positive effect on elo.figure  <dig>

congruence with previously reported fiber qtls
as of today, more than  <dig> fiber qtls have been reported by many researchers. although it is not easy to compare among the reported qtls in different studies using different populations, it is possible to compare the qtls identified in the present research to the prior studies using the common markers and the high density consensus genetic map. we considered two qtls the same if the associated markers were mapped within 5 cm in the consensus map  <cit> . of the  <dig> fiber qtls,  <dig> were reported in prior researches. the detail markers and references are shown in additional file  <dig>  some qtls or clusters were reported by different research groups. notable examples include qui-c <dig>  qtl clusters on chr. <dig>  chr. <dig>  chr. <dig>  and chr. <dig>  the fiber strength qtl, qstr-c <dig>  on chr. <dig> reported by zhang’s group  <cit>  was also identified in the present study. most of the prior qtls that our research agreed with were originally identified in g. hirsutum cultivars  <cit> , intraspecific populations  <cit> , chromosome substitution inbred population  <cit> , or interspecific populations but with a few generations of backcross with g. hirsutum. qtls identified in an interspecific population such as those reported by lacape et al. or yu et al.  <cit>  agreed poorly with our qtls. this might be due to the reasons mentioned in the background section such as qtls from g. barbadense not being present in upland cotton. this also presents a challenge using the qtls identified in an interspecific population in upland cotton breeding. fifty-four qtls reported in this research were not found to be close to any previously-reported fiber qtls, and could be considered as new fiber qtls.

said et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> fiber hotspots. we compared the fiber qtls identified in the present research with these hotspots to see whether any of these qtls belong to these hotspots. we used the high density consensus map and common markers as the guidance. if the qtl is within 10 cm range of the hotspot, the qtl is considered as part of the hotspot. fourteen qtls including  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for elo, mic, str, uhm, and ui, respectively, likely belong to the fiber hotspots described by said et al.  <cit> . the detail list of qtls and hotspots is shown in the additional file  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
one of the major challenges that cotton breeders have been facing when using mas to improve quantitative traits such as fiber quality is the difficulty to transfer a qtl from other species such as g. barbadense into upland cotton without compromise of other traits. while qtls identified in an intraspecific population will have fewer obstacles to implement in breeding, the low genetic diversity within upland cotton presents another challenge for researchers to accurately identify and map stable qtls with moderate to high effects. in this study, we used a random-mated recombinant inbred population involving  <dig> diverse upland cotton cultivars to identify fiber qtls. this approach ensured higher polymorphism which enabled us to genotype the ril population with  <dig> polymorphic ssr markers, the most as of today. coupled with a larger population , we have identified  <dig> fiber qtls and  <dig> qtl clusters at p <  <dig> . seventy-seven qtls were mapped at the same or similar positions as previously identified qtls in the literature, while  <dig> were new. by selecting favorable alleles of only  <dig> qtls , the mean trait value of the selected rils could be significantly improved . the qtl clusters on chr. <dig> and chr. <dig> had major effects on  <dig> fiber traits. using these two loci could simultaneously improve  <dig> fiber traits. we are continuing to evaluate these qtls across a panel of cotton varieties. in addition, we are testing these rils in multiple locations to obtain yield data, and to assess the effects of random-mating on breaking the negative linkage between yield and fiber quality traits.
