BACKGROUND
angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from the existing vasculature is associated with physiological  and pathological processes   <cit> . angiogenesis is mediated by pro-angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial cell growth factor , fibroblast growth factor- <dig> , angiopoietin, and epidermal growth factor   <cit> .

vegf comprises a family of multifunctional cytokines which include the variants vegf-a, -b, -c, -d and-e and placental growth factor   <cit> . vegf-a is mitogenic in vitro and angiogenic in vivo  <cit>  and its role in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis has been elucidated  <cit> . at least nine different isoforms of human vegf-a have been identified with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> amino acid residues  <cit> . of these, vegf <dig> is most clearly associated with pathological angiogenesis  <cit>  and exerts its biological action upon binding with two high affinity receptor tyrosine kinases; vegfr- <dig>  and vegfr- <dig>   <cit> . the role of these receptors, especially flk- <dig> in angiogenesis has been confirmed through gene knockout studies and flk-1-/- embryos are unable to form blood islands and to generate haematopoietic precursors . vegfr- <dig> has a  <dig> times higher binding affinity for vegfr- <dig> than vegfr- <dig>  <cit>  however, vegfr- <dig> has a stronger receptor tyrosine kinase activity than vegfr- <dig> and acts as a major mitogenic receptor on endothelial cells   <cit> .

due to the central role of angiogenesis in tumour growth and progression it has been a target in cancer therapy. for example bevacizumab, a vegf-a blocking antibody has been approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer  <cit>  and sunitinib, a vegf receptor antagonist for treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours and for advanced renal cell carcinoma  <cit> . several other vegf inhibitors including the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors , pegaptanib and sorafenib have been tested in phase- <dig> to phase-iii clinical trials against vegf-associated malignancies  <cit> .

natural compounds from medicinal plants display diverse pharmacological activities  <cit>  and have advantages over synthetic drugs, such as smoother action, better tolerance and fewer allergic reactions. cheiradone, a naturally occurring plant diterpene, was isolated from the medicinal plant euphobia chiradenia and in preliminary screening was shown to be a pla <dig> inhibitor, have anti-inflammatory properties and inhibit wound healing although the mechanisms of action were not investigated  <cit> .

in this study we have investigated the effect of cheiradone on vegf-induced angiogenesis and show vegf <dig> binding to vegfr- <dig> and - <dig> resultined in inhibition of in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis.

RESULTS
cheiradone inhibited vegf <dig> binding to vegfr- <dig> and -2
cheiradone was found to specifically inhibit the binding of vegf <dig> to vegfr- <dig> and vegfr- <dig> in a dose dependent manner with ic <dig> values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm respectively . no significant inhibition of fgfr- <dig> and - <dig> was observed even at the highest concentration  tested .

• ns = overall inhibition is less than 50% and therefore ic <dig> values cannot be calculated.

cheiradone inhibited vegf-induced ec proliferation
cheiradone was tested to evaluate its effect on cell proliferation in the presence of vegf, egf and fgf- <dig>  a concentration-dependent inhibition of vegf-stimulated baec and hdmec proliferation with ic <dig> values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm respectively   was observed. however, no significant inhibition of fgf-2- and egf-triggered cell proliferation was observed .

cheiradone inhibited vegf-induced ec migration
the effect of cheiradone on the migration of ecs was analysed using both two- and three-dimensional cell migration assays. in the two-dimensional assay, a wound-healing model was used to assess the migratory behaviour of baecs and hdmecs . in the vegf treated control group, significant wound healing was found  <dig> h after the cell monolayer was wounded with a sterile razor blade . no significant inhibition was observed on non-stimulated wound recovery  however, vegf- stimulated hdmec and baec migration was inhibited after  <dig> h in a dose dependent manner by cheiradone with ic <dig> values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm respectively . in a three-dimensional cell migration assay, baecs and hdmecs treated with vegf showed  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold increase in migration to the lower chamber compared to non-treated cells respectively . cheiradone was found to significantly inhibit  vegf-induced baec and hdmec migration with ic <dig> values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm respectively.

cheiradone had no effect on fgf- <dig> or egf stimulated migration in the concentration range used .

cheiradone inhibited vegf-induced ec tube formation
to examine the role of cheiradone on ec differentiation into vascular structures in vitro, tube formation of baecs and hdmcs on matrigel was assessed. when these cells were stimulated with vegf, elongated tube-like structures were formed and the process was inhibited in a dose dependent manner by cheiradone . cheiradone reduced the width and length of vegf-induced hdmec and baec tubes with ic <dig> values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm respectively . no significant effect of cheiradone was seen on non-stimulated tube formation .

cheiradone inhibited cell invasion
the effect of cheiradone on cell invasion was analysed using a transwell boyden chamber system coated with reconstituted growth factor-reduced matrigel. baecs or hdmecs were allowed to invade the lower chamber in the presence and absence of vegf and cheiradone. a statistically significant increased in cell invasion was observed in vegf treated hdmecs  and baecs  . cheiradone showed dose-dependent inhibition of vegf stimulated cell invasion of hdmec and baec with ic <dig> values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm respectively .

cheiradone inhibited angiogenesis in the cam assay
the above in vitro data suggests that cheiradone inhibits several steps of angiogenesis in vitro. therefore, we analyzed its effect on in vivo angiogenesis using the cam assay. after exogenous stimulation of angiogenesis with vegf <dig>  significant new blood vessel growth was observed towards the stimulus after  <dig> days . there was no significant angiogenic response to cheiradone alone . vegf165-induced blood vessels formation was completely abolished in the presence of cheiradone  . there was no evidence of an inflammatory response with cheiradone alone  or in the control .

cytotoxicity study
no significant cytotoxicity was found at the tested concentrations of cheiradone , whereas staurosporine induced a noticeable cytotoxic effect in the mtt  and immunofluorescence  assays.

discussion
sesterterpenes are naturally occurring polyisoprene compounds widely distributed in plants and animals. there is growing interest in these molecules as potential disrupters of protein-protein interactions  <cit>  since many protein interfaces are characterised by extended, flat surfaces and a number of small molecules which interfere with protein-protein binding have been identified  <cit> . in addition, members of the sesterterpene family have moderate antibacterial activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis strain hrv, inhibit dna replication  <cit> , are cytotoxic against tumour cell lines  <cit>  and have potent antiplasmodial properties  <cit> .

during angiogenesis, nascent blood vessels grow by sprouting from the existing vasculature by a cascade of events including degradation of the basement membrane, ec migration, proliferation and tube formation  <cit> . vegf exerts its angiogenic effect by binding to high affinity receptors on ec. in addition other growth factors, fgf- <dig> and egf and their corresponding receptors are associated with angiogenesis  <cit> .

in this study, we demonstrated that cheiradone inhibited multiple steps of vegf-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. vegf is the main regulator of angiogenesis and elevated levels have been reported in pathological conditions. the binding of vegf to high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors such as vegfr- <dig> &  <dig> activates vegf-dependent signalling cascades which initiate the early events of angiogenesis . our in vitro inhibition data showed that cheiradone appeared to inhibit ec proliferation and migration with ic <dig> values in the range  <dig> – <dig>  μm. in the later stages of angiogenesis, ecs differentiate into tubular like structures that eventually form the lumen of the new vessel. the in vitro matrigel tube formation assay showed that cheiradone inhibited vegf-induced tube-like structures at low concentrations. we also demonstrated that cheiradone completely inhibited angiogenesis in vivo using the cam assay. therefore, cheiradone appears an effective antagonist of angiogenesis. cheiradone was equally effective at inhibiting angiogenesis in both large vessel-derived  and small vessel-derived cells .

binding studies with vegfr- <dig> and - <dig> showed significant inhibition of vegf binding in the presence of cheiradone, with stronger inhibition of vegfr- <dig>  when cells were pre-incubated with cheiradone, and the cheiradone removed prior to addition of vegf a significant inhibition of cell proliferation was still observed, indicating that cheiradone was not interacting directly with vegf. instead cheiradone competed with vegf for binding to a vegf receptor. both vegfr- <dig> and - <dig> contain extracellular, juxtamembrane and tyrosine kinase domains. we have no evidence which domain cheiradone binds to and are currently investigating the tyrosine kinase activity of the vegf receptors in the presence of the inhibitor. an additional mechanism by which cheiradone can affect vegf-induced angiogenesis is by regulating the expression levels of vegfr- <dig> and/or vegfr- <dig>  we are currently investigating the interaction of cheiradone with the receptors on endothelial cells.

semino et al.,  <cit>  have developed an in vivo model of angiogenesis in the presence of interstitial flow. they propose a two step model of angiogenesis requiring initial activation by vegf and subsequent maturation of the new blood vessel on exposure to egf. cheiradone would be an ideal molecule to test this model since it has no activity against egf. in vivo, vegfr- <dig> is constitutively expressed in the blood vascular system while vegfr- <dig> is down regulated but is over expressed in angiogeneic endothelial cells and after hypoxia  <cit> . we have shown that cheiradone is more active against vegfr- <dig> and may therefore be a more specific molecule for targeting angiogenic blood vessels in diseases such as cancer.

in addition, cytotoxicity studies showed that cheiradone had no adverse effects at concentrations greater than those used in the present study.

the advantage of cheiradone over existing vegf inhibitors is that it does not remove vegf from the system and vegf activity may be modulated by varying the concentration of cheiradone.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that cheiradone, a naturally occurring sesterterpene inhibits vegf-induced angiogenesis by competing with vegf for vegfr- <dig> and - <dig>  there was no activity against fgf- <dig> or egf. further study of the structural relationships of cheiradone and its activity may provide a basis for designing vegf receptor antagonist with enhanced inhibitory potential and improved specificity.
