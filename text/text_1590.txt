BACKGROUND
pertussis  caused by b. pertussis , remains a major global public health problem  <cit> . despite a vaccine coverage over 90% in newborns, pertussis remains endemic in the western countries  <cit> . in the first months of  <dig>  outbreaks have been described in ireland  <cit> , israel  <cit>  and usa  <cit> . in california a new outbreak in  <dig> was particularly severe, with  <dig>  reported cases from january 1st to december 31st  <cit>  .

the efficacy of current vaccination programs is likely hampered by adaptation of the pathogen, overcoming the effect of herd immunity  <cit> . a comprehensive study covering bp clinical isolates from  <dig> to  <dig> showed the appearance of a bp strain that carries a mutation in the pertussis toxin promoter; the increased expression of this virulence factor directly correlated with the resurgence of pertussis in the last decades in the netherlands  <cit> . another study from the same country, covering the period  <dig> to  <dig>  showed the circulation of different serotypes of the pathogen in correlation with the use of whole cell or acellular pertussis vaccines in different time-frames  <cit> . substantial evidence has been accumulated in the last two years that immunity induced by acellular vaccines is much shorter lived than immunity induced by whole cell vaccines  <cit> .

there is an unmet need i) to depict the immunological recognition matrix to understand the specific epitope recognition pattern induced by natural infection with bp, ii) to identify differences in immune recognition induced by available bp vaccines as compared to natural infection, and iii) to objectively define the qualitative differences in humoral target recognition induced by current vaccines  <cit> . we assessed in the current study the immune recognition pattern in serum from infants with whooping cough and in  <dig> groups of infants randomized to different bp vaccines from a trial conducted  <dig> in sweden  <cit>  using a high-content peptide microarray. the immune recognition profile  represents a detailed molecular recognition ‘fingerprint’ of serum igg directed against linear epitopes.

material and methods
patient samples
samples were randomly selected among the serum samples from the pertussis vaccine stockholm trial i  <cit> , stored at the bio-bank of the swedish national institute of public health. samples from children born during  <dig>  collected at  <dig> study sites after the completion of the vaccination , were included in the study according to the following scheme as described in detail  <cit> . <dig> children who received a diphtheria  and tetanus , vaccine  as placebo, and developed whooping cough;;

 <dig> children immunized with the diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis  whole cell   vaccine licensed in the united states ;

 <dig> children immunized with the  <dig> component acellular candidate dtpa <dig> vaccine ;

 <dig> ichildren immunized with the  <dig> component acellular candidate dtpa <dig> vaccine ;

 <dig> children immunized with the swedish-produced dt vaccine and did not develop whooping cough.



sera were collected 30 days after the last dose, except for the group which whooping cough .

ethics statement
the stockholm regional ethics committee north  has approved the study. all subjects provided informed consent. both parents of the children provided informed consent on their behalf. the informed consent was provided in a written format, signed and is on file at the swedish national institute of public health, stockholm, sweden.

microarray slides and experiments
peptide microarray slides were customized and manufactured by jpt . the slides contain three identical sub-arrays with  <dig>  unique peptides on each subarray. each sub-array contains  <dig> blocks arranged in a regular pattern, with spots arranged in a matrix  <dig> x  <dig>  an image of a microarray is provided in the additional file 1: figure s <dig>  and a table with the list of the peptides, additional file 2: table s <dig>  are available in the online data supplement. each sub-array contains positive controls, negative controls and the unique peptides spanning  <dig> bp proteins , a total of  <dig>  spots per slide. the entire amino acid sequence of each bp protein was printed on the microarray, as 15-mer amino acid peptides overlapping the previous and next printed peptides by  <dig> amino acids; this allows to identify minimal amino acid epitopes of  <dig> amino acids per spot defined by antibody reactivity. variant peptides for the  <dig> bp proteins, published earlier  <cit> , were also printed on the microarray .table  <dig>

experiments were performed following a standardized protocol  <cit> : 300 μl serum diluted 1/ <dig> in washing solution  were pipetted on the peptide microarray slide, covered with a cover slip  to evenly distribute the dilution over the slide and incubated at +4°c in a humid chamber for 16 hours; after the removal of the cover slip, the slides were washed  <dig> times on a shaker for 5 min each .after washing, 300 μl cy5-labeled goat anti-human igg, affinity purified secondary antibody  diluted 1/ <dig> in the washing solution were added , and incubated in the dark 1 hour in a humid chamber at room temperature. washing steps were repeated after the incubation with the secondary antibody. prior to scanning, slides were dried with a slid spinner . five additional slides were processed using only buffer in the first incubation step, to detect false positive spots due to non-specific binding of the secondary reagent. high-definition images from the slides were acquired with genepix 4000b microarray scanner  using the wavelength 635 nm  and 532 nm . data acquisition from the images was performed with the software gene pix  <dig> pro .

data analysis
data analysis consisted of  <dig> steps as described  <cit> .

quality control
all images and aligned files were visually inspected to check for artifacts and for spots erroneously flagged by the software. images of background and foreground intensities were produced for every sub-array by using bioinformatics tools. all spots or areas which did not represent a high quality signal were removed from analysis. further quality controls were also performed  <cit>  and the intensity values were background-corrected ).

false positive, “empty” spots removal and exclusion of low intensity signal spots
all spots showing a response on the buffer slides - and for this reason identified as possible false positive - were removed from the analysis, as well as all spots that did not show any signal  in the data acquisition process. low response spots, with a signal below a computed cut off  were also removed.

normalization
the normalization process was performed using the simple linear model as described before  <cit> . the quality of the normalization was assessed by inspection of the normalized data plot in all the study groups.

analysis and data mining
data analysis was performed using two different statistical methods:  pam   <cit> , a predictive analysis which performs sample classification from peptide recognition data providing a list of significant peptides whose response level characterizes each diagnostic group. compared to other differential recognition analysis methods, pam is highly selective and allows the detailed examination of each time point in case of consecutive serum testing. this reveals only the peptide target with good predictive power associated with the differentiation of the patient group. this will result in a set of peptides constantly weakly recognized in one group and strongly in the other group.  ‘exclusive recognition analysis’  of epitopes predicted by pam. the latter approach identifies epitopes recognized in serum from individuals exclusively in one group but never in serum from any individual in a control reference group, e.g. in the current report the ‘reference’ individuals who received placebo . strongly recognized peptides identified in each group were plotted according to index value and number of times they were recognized in the group of interest. lastly, a 3d-graphical representation of the “reactome”  <cit>  of b. pertussis proteins was computed for every group, by plotting mean index value for every peptide, as well as the protein and position on the respective amino acid-sequence of the protein. a similar 3d-plot was computed to compare the signals in two study groups, plotting the Δ value between the mean index values in the two groups .

all pre-processing and statistical analyses were performed customizing open-source packages of bioconductor, r software  <cit> . in addition, to assess the statistical significance of the differences in the trends of recognition  with whooping cough group vs. all remaining groups, as well as the dt  group vs. the remaining groups, a chi-square test for the goodness of fit was used.

epitope comparison with published data
in order to relate our results to the epitopes which have been identified previously in the literature, we searched the b-cell immune epitope database  <cit>   site  and homologous sequences highlighted.

RESULTS
differential recognition of bp epitopes in children with whooping cough
three thousand eighty five peptides remained in the analysis after quality control, i.e. after false positive, empty and low intensity signal spots removal. analysis of sera from children with whooping cough showed that  <dig>  of  <dig>  peptides were commonly recognized in in 10/ <dig> serum samples.  <dig>  peptides were recognized in 10/ <dig> serum samples from subjects who received the dtpwc vaccine, while  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  peptides were recognized in sera obtained from 10/ <dig> children receiving the dtpa <dig> vaccine, the dtpa <dig> vaccine or the dt vaccine, respectively . figure  <dig> shows the number of peptides recognized in serum from 10/ <dig>  9/ <dig> and 8/ <dig> children in each group . the trend of peptide epitope recognition was similar between natural bp infection and dptwc , while it was statistically different between serum recognition patterns associated with whooping cough and the groups who received the acellular vaccines . table  <dig> shows the frequency of recognition per peptide species, their origin on the respective bp protein, stratified for the study groups.figure  <dig> number of peptides recognized in each study group in all , 90%  and 80%  serum samples obtained from children s in each test group. the trend of recognition  was similar between natural infection and dptwc , while it was statistically different in the comparison between natural infection and the remaining groups .

the table shows the recognition frequency of target peptides spotted on the microarray slides, stratified per study group and by target proteins. whooping cough: children who received the placebo and developed whooping cough; dtpwc: diphtheria tetanus pertussis whole cell vaccine; dtpa5: diphtheria tetanus pertussis  <dig> component vaccine; dtpa2: diphtheria tetanus pertussis  <dig> component vaccine; dt: children who received only the diphtheria tetanus vaccine; all groups n = 10; none of the children in the vaccine groups, including dt, were diagnosed with a condition related to b. pertussis infection.



figure  <dig> shows the 3d representation of the “reactome” in each group, this ‘landscape recognition pattern’ depicts the qualitative appreciation of differences in antibody recognition patterns between different  groups as a function of the igg signal strength to individual bp epitopes. the igg target recognition pattern induced by the dtpwc and the dtpa <dig> vaccines were similar to the serum pattern from children with whooping cough, while the dtpa <dig> group showed a shape similar to the recognition pattern detected in the dt group .figure  <dig> 3d-plots representing the mean index value reactivity in each individual study group. a) dtpwc: children who received the diphtheria tetanus pertussis whole cell vaccine; b) dtpa5: diphtheria tetanus pertussis  <dig> components vaccine; c) dtpa2: i diphtheria tetanus pertussis  <dig> components vaccine; d) whooping cough: children who received the placebo and developed natural infection; e) dt: children vaccinated the placebo, who did not develop whooping cough. the proteins on the microarray are aligned the :  <dig> - p.69a protein ;  <dig> - bordetella resistance to killing;  <dig> - tracheal colonization factor;  <dig> - vag <dig> protein ;  <dig> - pertussis toxin subunit  <dig> precursor;  <dig> - pertussis toxin subunit  <dig> precursor;  <dig> - pertussis toxin subunit  <dig> precursor;  <dig> - pertussis toxin subunit  <dig> precursor;  <dig> - pertussis toxin subunit  <dig> precursor;  <dig> - bifunctional hemolysin-adenylate cyclaseprecursor;  <dig> - filamentous hemagglutinin;  <dig> - fim <dig> pilic subunit;  <dig> - serotype  <dig> fimbrial subunit precursor;  <dig> - outer membrane porin protein precursor;  <dig> - outer membrane porin protein ompq;  <dig> - gtp-binding elongation factor;  <dig> - putative autotransporter. the dtpwc and the dtpa <dig> vaccines were similar to the pattern obtained from serum from children diagnosed wth whooping cough, while the dtpa <dig> group showed a shape similar to the igg recognition pattern detected in the dt group.



different igg reactome and exclusive recognition of bp epitopes in sera from infected children
next, we visualized differences between the ‘reactome patterns’. the bp serum recognition pattern from individuals with whooping cough and from the dtpa <dig> groups showed a characteristic shape of igg recognition curves using the computed Δ value for mean indexes using the dt group as a reference . the 3d-plots visualize the differential mean index value in the whooping cough  and dtpa <dig>  groups as compared to the reference, i.e. the mean index value in the dt  group. the 3d plots help to visualize the overall recognition pattern, based on serum igg binding to individual epitopes, yet it does not identify peptides that are exclusively recognized in a  group. we show in figure 3b the exclusive recognition analysis  of sera from children with whooping cough  and dtpa <dig>  groups vs. the dt group. these peptides are exclusively recognized in the respective test group at the indicated frequency  and never in serum from any individual in the dt group .  <dig> peptides were strongly recognized in serum from at least  <dig> out  <dig> of the children developing whooping cough and never in any serum samples from an children in the dt  for peptides exclusively detected in each of the study groups vs. serum from non vaccinated children, in the supplementary material).figure.  <dig> differential target epitope recognition in patients with whooping cough. figure 3a: 3d-plots representing the differential mean index value in the whooping cough  and dtpa <dig>  groups as compared to the reference the mean index value in the dt group. figure 3b: inclusive/exclusive analysis of serum reactivity from children in the whooping cough  and dtpa <dig>  groups vs. the dt  group. these peptides are exclusively recognized in the respective test group at the indicated frequency  and never in serum from any individual in the dt group.  <dig> peptides were strongly recognized in serum from at least  <dig> out  <dig> of the children developing whooping cough;  <dig> peptides were highly recognized in serum from at least  <dig> out of  <dig> infants in the dtpa <dig> group. no specific pattern of recognition was detected by the inclusive/exclusive analysis in the other study groups. dtpa2: infants who received the diphtheria tetanus pertussis  <dig> components vaccine, dt: infants not vaccinated and who did tno developed whooping cough.



 <dig> strongly and exclusively recognized linear bp epitopes  could be identified in 10/ <dig> serum samples from patients with whooping cough;  <dig> peptides were derived from pertussis toxin components ;  <dig> peptides from adhesion proteins ; and  <dig> peptide from the transporter protein ompp. in serum samples from the dtpa <dig> group,  <dig> peptide was derived from the tracheal colonization factor  and a different peptide epitope from the gtp-binding elongation factor . the two peptides specifically recognized in the dtpa <dig> group did not belong to the  <dig> proteins used as vaccine components; the sequence of these  <dig> peptides is reported in table  <dig>  we performed then a comparative 3d analysis of bp epitope recognition in serum from children with whooping cough versus the control, i.e. the reference group who received dt , to visualize which bp proteins are predominantly recognized in serum from bp- infected children. strong igg epitope target recognition could be observed to components of filamentous hemagglutinin, yet comparatively relatively weak igg reactivity directed against the vag <dig> protein and a factor which confers resistance to killing.table  <dig>

children who received the the dtpa <dig> vaccine
the table shows the sequence of target epitopes specifically recognized in serum  children with whooping cough  and in serum from children who receivedthe diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis acellular  <dig> components  vaccine . peptide microarray slides containing unique bp peptides  were processed and analyzed. we list here only peptides which were exclusively recognized in serum samples from individuals either with the natural bp infection or after dtpa <dig> vaccination and never recognized in any serum samples from individuals who received the placebo .



differential recognition of bp epitopes identified by pam segregates bp vaccines
the exclusive epitope recognition analysis yields peptide targets that are unique for each test cohort. a different kind of analysis, pam, identifies epitopes that are both always strongly recognized in the reference, and always weakly recognized in the ‘test’ group  in serum from each individual in the group. this allows predicting whether a reactivity pattern is associated to a certain defined endpoint . alternatively, this method allows also comparing groups of individuals, i.e. individuals who received different kinds of bp vaccines.

figure  <dig> shows the comparison of the vaccinated groups, as well as the bp-infected group along with the group who received  placebo. the peptide epitope targets are only shown if they exhibited a constant reactivity pattern for each of the  <dig> individuals in the test groups. the dtpa <dig> group yielded  <dig>  the dtpa <dig>  <dig> and the whole cell vaccine  <dig> bp targets that were differentially recognized as compared to the placebo group. infection with bordetella pertussis yielded  <dig> targets that were differentially recognized as compared to the group who received  placebo. the identity of these targets and location within each target molecule is provided in the online additional file 2: table s <dig> . the comparison between the vaccinated groups with the  <dig> individual who experienced natural infection resulted in  <dig> targets for the dtpa <dig>   <dig> targets for the dtpa <dig> and  <dig> targets for the group who received the whole cell vaccine . as expected, the comparison between the placebo and the infected group results also in  <dig> bp targets that would segregate infected versus non- bp infected individuals. the detailed listing of the targets is provided in the additional file 2: table s <dig> .figure  <dig> pam analysis of strongly versus weakly recognized bp target epitopes segregates vaccination with different vaccines compared to healthy controls . epitopes are recognized in serum from 10/ <dig> individuals in each group, the number of targets that segregates each group is listed. the colors are based on the fluorescence intensity of the peptide microarray results. red: strong recognition and green: weak recognition. the identity of each target peptide is listed in the additional file 2: table s <dig> 



peptide microarray analysis identifies previously described b-cell epitopes
finally, we examined if already published bp epitopes were captured by the peptide microarray matrix: sixty-five b. pertussis b-cell epitopes were retrieved from the iedb , showing that the platform utilized in this report picks up already described b-cell epitopes. we identified bp target peptides that were frequently recognized; these target peptides exhibited a variant amino acid sequence which occurs in natural bp clinical isolates – the non-variant peptide epitopes were not recognized .

discussion
primary prevention remains the main intervention to limit pertussis occurrence and new transmission. the protective effect mediated by the bp vaccine appeared to vanish over time  <cit>  and emergence of bp strains carrying mutations of virulence factors has been reported  <cit> 

our study explored the immune response against bp induced by natural infection and  <dig> different vaccines in children enrolled in a clinical trial conducted in sweden  <cit> : this trial showed that acellular vaccines, in particular dtpa <dig>  ensured the best ratio between protection from whooping cough and acceptable rates of side effects.

we have been able to i) identify a high number of b-cell epitopes that have been described in the literature and the bp epitope database with the peptide microarray technology described in this report , ii) show robust differences between different vaccines concerning epitope recognition patterns , and iii) picked up differences in igg mutant bp epitopes, i.e. that not the wildtype, yet the naturally occurring variant bp epitope was recognized . these results suggest that peptide microarrays provide a platform to visualize quantitative and qualitative differences in humoral recognition patterns at the epitope level. this may be relevant since genetic changes in bp have been reported  <cit> .

serum from children with whooping cough displayed the broadest bp epitope antibody recognition, with a certain number of peptides exclusively recognized in this group. only serum analysis from individuals vaccinated with dtpwc showed a similar trend concerning the number of recognized bp peptides, consistent with the fact that all the components of the bacterial wall are present in this vaccine preparation. the dtpa <dig> as well as the dtpa <dig> vaccine induced a significantly different humoral recognition pattern. the dtpa <dig> vaccine appeared to boost pre-existing bp-reactive antibody responses as compared to the induction and expansion of new antibody reactivity pattern directed to new bp target antigens.. this is reflected in stronger recognition of the proteins bordetella resistance to killing , vag <dig> protein, putative autotransporter . conversely, humoral recognition of the filamentous hemagglutinin  appears to be induced by vaccination with the dtpwc vaccine as well as after natural infection with bp.

the immune responses induced by bp in the course of whooping cough after resolution is long-lasting and more protracted as compared to the immune response induced by vaccines; it may offer new potential targets to improve vaccine design for pertussis once the nature of the antibody reactivity mediating immune protection will be deciphered. the dtpa <dig> vaccine has a very good safety profile, yet its effect has been questioned in the past particularly in terms of protection and its duration  <cit> . this could, in part, be explained by the fact that the dtpa <dig> vaccine acts by boosting a pre-existing ‘natural’ bp recognition matrix, as compared to other vaccines which rather induced a shift in serum bp epitope recognition patterns. both dtpwc and dtpa <dig> showed a reactome similar to the bp natural infection; future studies may address whether this would be related to increased protection induced by these vaccines compared to the dtpa <dig>  <cit> .

there are at least four different, not mutually exclusive explanations concerning the spectrum of bp target recognition induced by different vaccines: i) vaccines could boost and modulate the recognition matrix for natural occurring and bp specific antibodies directed against bordetella spp, eliciting pre-existing humoral immune responses directed against bp epitopes. this is consistent with the concept that ‘natural antibodies’ are a fundamental part of the immune system and play a crucial role in modulating the recognition  to self and ‘non-self’ infectious antigens  <cit>  ii) children without bp vaccination experience most likely the full-blown disease with the typical whooping cough presentation, yet some  individuals appear to experience limited disease, suggesting that ‘abortive’ cases or even immune protection may occur in the absence of vaccination  <cit> . therefore, silent infection or colonization with other bordetella species   <cit>  could be responsible in the modulation of the immunological recognition matrix directed against bp.

most of the serum immune responses in the groups of our study were shared among the individuals in each group , yet we identified also ‘private’ humoral responses unique for each individuals ; iii) potentially cross-reactive antibodies which target closely related hemagglutinin or fimbriae from other bacterial species may be responsible for different efficacy of the vaccines iv) vaccination leads not only to epitope-specific immune responses directed against targets contained in the vaccine, yet to other molecular targets as well . this concept is appreciated in other areas of medicine and contributes to clinical efficacy of some vaccines. for instance, antigen-spreading mediates vaccination-induced regression in human melanoma  <cit>  and the impact of different  adjutants on the antibody repertoire to target protective epitopes is appreciated in the development of humoral and cellular immune responses against influenza a  <cit> .

if the human proteome is scanned as 5mer peptides, then up to 90% of the viral proteome may show similarity to the human proteome  <cit> . this information is more easily accessible using peptide microarrays, since igg recognition patterns are mapped using defined peptide targets that can be tested for amino acid composition similarities with related or unrelated protein targets.

we show here that not only the antibody titers directed against specific bp targets, yet also the detailed recognition focus of vaccine components was different, even if the vaccines contained the same molecular components, supporting the notion that bp vaccine composition impacts on the quality of antibody response  <cit> .

peptide-microarray-guided analysis may also help to decipher the phenomenon of ‘epitope suppression’  <cit>  which has recently gained interest in bp vaccine evaluation. individuals primed with a bp  whole cell vaccine exhibited decreased pertussis attack rates as compared to individuals primed with acellular vaccines  <cit> : differential target epitope focus associated with different vaccine formulation was evident in the pam-analysis reported in the current study .

CONCLUSIONS
microarray analysis offered for the first time a comprehensive characterization of the immune response to bp after natural infection in comparison to  <dig> vaccines. the report shows the potential of the high-content peptide microarray technique in infectious diseases, detecting epitopes by far more numerous and likely more immunogenic compared to the ones already reported in electronic databases. it also offers a new possibility to objectively decipher immune reactivity in clinically well-defined test groups undergoing vaccination strategies and allows to test for batch-to-batch consistency. target recognition patterns in serum from individuals who experienced infection with bp  could guide the development of bp vaccines.
