BACKGROUND
hypoxia/ischemia  during prenatal brain development is a major cause of neural cell loss, and consequently morbidity and mortality in infants and children  <cit> . it is estimated that  <dig> % -  <dig> % of full-term infants and ~50% of surviving preterm infants suffer brain damage caused by h/i injury  <cit> , leading to cerebral palsy, epilepsy, cognitive deficits and growth retardation in affected children.

several lines of experimental evidence implicate insulin-like growth factor  in protecting neurons from injury-induced cell death and in promoting neural repair during recovery: 1) igf-i mrna abundance falls sharply in injured and surrounding areas during the first  <dig> hr following h/i injury  <cit> , concurrent with significant neuronal apoptosis during this time  <cit> ; and then increases during recovery  <cit> . 2) injection of exogenous igf-i into the lateral ventricle immediately or shortly after h/i injury attenuates h/i-induced brain damage and neuron loss  <cit> , and oligodendrocyte precursor damage  <cit> . locally administered igf-i also promotes neural tissue recovery  <cit> . 3) more recently, peripherally administered igf-i  mitigates h/i brain injury significantly, in part by promoting the survival of neuronal cells and the proliferation of neural precursor cells. notably, igf-i remains effective when given by subcutaneous injection  <dig> and  <dig> hrs after h/i injury  <cit> , a finding that supports its potential clinical utility in treating ischemic neural injury.

the type  <dig> igf receptor  is essential in mediating igf actions during neural cell development  <cit> . whether the igf1r also plays a key role in igf's neuroprotection and/or promotion of neural regeneration following h/i injury, however, has not been directly demonstrated. in an earlier study, the data of guan et al  <cit>  raised the possibility that these igf-i actions involve mechanisms in addition to those mediated by the igf1r. des-igf-i, an igf-i analog lacking the n-terminal three peptides, retains the high affinity of the native peptide for the igf1r, but has greatly reduced affinity for igf binding proteins . consequently, it is generally more potent than native igf-i, because its actions are not inhibited by igfbps. nonetheless, guan et al.  <cit>  showed that des-igf-i was much less effective than native igf-i in mitigating h/i-induced brain damage, suggesting that igf-i could exert its effects independent of igf1r and/or that it requires igfbps.

to directly address the role of the igf1r in neuroprotection following h/i, we studied neuronal cell survival following h/i in conditional mutant mice in which the igfir expression is halved specifically in nestin-expressing neuronal precursors and their progeny . we demonstrated that signaling through igf1r is critically important for neuronal cell survival in developing brains following h/i injury.

RESULTS
general
similar to our previous report  <cit> , the somatic growth of uninjured nes-igf1r-/wt and control mice was not significantly different during development. after h/i injury, however, both nes-igf1r-/wt and control mice exhibited reduced body weight, being ~80% and ~70% of uninjured mice from  <dig> to  <dig> days after injury  and at  <dig> dai, respectively . somatic growth of injured control mice gradually caught up such that by  <dig> dai their body weights were similar to those of uninjured mice. the body weight of injured nes-igf1r-/wt mice, however, remained reduced by ~15% . a similar percentage of control mice and nes-igf1r-/wt mice  died during ischemia surgery and hypoxia. nes-igf1r-/wt mutant mice, however, appeared to be more susceptible to death after h/i injury. about 16% of nes-ifg1r -/wt mice died within  <dig> hr after surgery, while only ~8% of control mice died during the same period . the increase, however, did not meet statistical significance.

control mice  and nes-igf1r-/wt mice  were subjected to h/i insult, as described in the methods section. the percentage of mice dying during common carotid artery ligation surgery, hypoxia treatment, or  <dig> hours after h/i insult in each group is reported in the parentheses. statistical analysis was done using x <dig>  assisted with the software sigmastat for windows . no significance was observed.

blunting neuronal igf1r expression increases h/i-induced brain edema
h/i-induced edema, characterized by increased tissue water, enlarged tissue volume , and reduced cell density, has been well-documented  <cit> . similar to the morphologic observation of menley et al.  <cit> , our examination of brains of injured mice showed that the hemisphere and hippocampus ipsilateral to the ligated right common carotid artery appeared to be larger than their contralateral counterparts, while cell density in injured areas was significantly reduced . this increased size caused by h/i is consistent with h/i-induced swelling/edema. to quantify h/i-induced swelling/edema in hemisphere and hippocampus, we performed stereological analysis of rapidly frozen brains of h/i-injured mice at  <dig> dai.

while the size of the ipsilateral hemisphere was not significantly increased in control mice, it was significantly increased in nes-igf1r-/wt mice . consistently, the size of the ipsilateral hippocampus, including both hippocampal proper  and dentate gyrus , also was increased in control and nes-igf1r-/wt mice. when calculated as a percentage of their respective contralateral sizes, the volumes of the ipsilateral hemisphere and hippocampus in nes-igf1r-/wt mice were increased by 15% to 17%, as compared to that of control mice .

control mice  and nes-igf1r-/wt mice  that underwent h/i were sacrificed at  <dig> dai and their brains were frozen-sectioned. the volumes of hemisphere and hippocampus  from each side were measured. #, p <  <dig> ; *, p <  <dig> ; **, p <  <dig> , compared to their respective contralateral.

blunting neuronal igf1r expression exacerbates h/i-induced infarct
while hypoxia and ischemia without hypoxia had no obvious impact on neuronal cells in both control mice and nes-igf1r-/wt mice, ischemia followed by hypoxia resulted in significant and widespread damage to the hemisphere ipsilateral to the ligated right common carotid artery, including neurons in cerebral cortex, hip and dg . h/i of control mice resulted in an infarct area that averaged ~13% and ~16% of the ipsilateral hemisphere at  <dig> dai and  <dig> dai, respectively . compared to control mice, the percentage of ipsilateral hemisphere infarct area in nes-igf1r-/wt mice was doubled or more at each time point examined . infarct area in mice  <dig> dai often became cystic or occupied by an enlarged lateral ventricle . compared to controls the relative volume of the ipsilateral hemisphere in nes-igf1r-/wt mice, thus, was significantly smaller at  <dig> dai, and that of the hippocampuses was much smaller at both  <dig> and  <dig> dai, .

blunting neuronal igf1r expression exacerbates h/i-induced reduction of hip and dg neurons
to more precisely define the impact of reduced igf1r expression on neuronal cells following h/i injury, we performed stereological analysis of hip and dg. hip and dg have a distinct and relatively simple cyto-architecture that facilitates our analysis of neuronal cell response following injury.

following h/i, control mice exhibited significant neuronal loss in the injured ipsilateral hip and dg, resulting in a significant reduction in neuron density in cornu ammonis  and dg regions . when compared to the contralateral, neuron density in control mice at  <dig> dai exhibited a  <dig> - 45% reduction in the pyramidal neuron layer  of ipsilateral ca <dig> and ca <dig>  and a  <dig> - 30% reduction in ca <dig> pcl and in dg granule cell layer  . many neurons in affected ipsilateral ca and gcl contained a condensed cell nucleus  , a hallmark of apoptosis. with increasing time after injury, neural repair and recovery in control mice were apparent as manifested by a gradually increasing neuron density, although neuronal density remained reduced compared to the uninjured contralateral hemisphere .

blunting igf1r expression in nes-igf1r-/wt mice resulted in a more dramatic reduction in the density of neurons in both h/i-injured ipsilateral ca pcl and dg gcl. when compared to control mice at  <dig> dai, nes-igf1r-/wt mice exhibited a trend toward a reduction in relative neuron density in ipsilateral ca <dig> pcl and gcl , and in ca <dig> and ca <dig> pcl . at  <dig> dai the relative density of neurons was significantly reduced by  <dig> - 50% in pcl of ca regions and in gcl of dg . at  <dig> dai the relative densities of ipsilateral ca and dg neurons in nes-igf1r-/wt mice remained reduced in ca <dig> 

consistent with the reduction in the size of hemisphere and hippocampus , the volume of pcl and gcl ipsilateral to h/i injury also appear to be reduced . in this experiment, the volume of pcl in ca <dig> and ca <dig> was combined for calculation. with increasing time following h/i, the volume of ipsilateral pcl and gcl gradually decreased in both control and nes-igf1r-/wt mice. compared to control mice, however, the magnitude of reduction in nes-igf1r-/wt mice appeared to be greater ; but these changes  did not meet statistical significance.

blunting neuronal igf1r expression aggravates h/i-induced apoptosis in hip and dg neurons
injury-induced cell death largely contributed to the neuronal loss observed in both nes-igf1r-/wt and control mice. when the histological appearance of pyknosis was used as a measure, more than 90% of the damaged cells appeared to be apoptotic during the course of the experiment. few neurons in hip and dg contralateral to the ligated right common carotid artery underwent apoptosis, and the density of pyknotic cells was from  <dig> -  <dig> cells/mm <dig> in control mice and  <dig> -  <dig> cells/mm <dig> in nes-igf1r-/wt mice, respectively. when compared to control mice during development, the density of pyknotic cells was significantly increased in nes-igf1r-/wt mice, a finding that is consistent with our previous report  <cit> . a marked increase in the number of pyknotic cells in nes-igf1r-/wt mice also was observed when pyknotic cells number was expressed as a percent of total cell number .

following h/i injury the density of pyknotic cells was markedly increased in the ipsilateral side in both groups of mice at each time assessed. when compared to control mice, the density of pyknotic cells in nes-igf1r-/wt mice was  <dig>  -  <dig> folds more in ca <dig> and ca <dig> at  <dig> dai, and  <dig> -  <dig> fold more in all regions examined at  <dig> dai . while by  <dig> dai the number of pyknotic cells in ipsilateral hip and dg fell significantly in both control and nes-igf1r-/wt mice, the density of pyknotic cells in nes-igf1r-/wt mice remained elevated, compared to control mice.

increased neuronal apoptosis in nes-igf1r-/wt mice was confirmed using tunel labeling of brain sections from mice  <dig> dai. most, if not all, pyknotic cells were found to be tunel-positive, and very few tunel-positive cells were observed in contralateral hemispheres. however, abundant cells were tunel-labeled in the ipsilateral ca pcl and dg gcl in both control and nes-igf1r-/wt mice . similar to our findings on pyknotic cells, the density of tunel-positive apoptotic cells was increased by  <dig> -  <dig> fold in ipsilateral ca pcl and dg gcl of nes-igf1r-/wt mice . quantification of cells positive for active caspase- <dig> in the hippocampus also showed a similar result .

igf-i-igf1r signaling promotes survival protein mrna expression
to determine whether igf1r signaling promotes neuronal survival by regulating the expression of anti-apoptosis protein genes, we examined the abundance of mrna for cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein - <dig> and x-linked iap . compared to that in control mice, the contralateral hemisphere of nes-igf1r-/wt mice exhibited ~55% and ~40% reductions in the abundance of ciap- <dig> and xiap mrna, respectively , indicating that blunting igf1r significantly reduced the abundance of mrna for ciap- <dig> and xiap in developing brain. following h/i injury, the abundance of ciap- <dig> and xiap mrna was increased by ~180% and ~234% in ipsilateral hemispheres of control mice, as compared to that of their contralateral hemispheres. this finding is consistent with data showing that ciap- <dig> and xiap protein abundance is increased in h/i-injured brain  <cit> . the increases in ciap- <dig> and xiap mrna abundance induced by h/i injury, however, were suppressed by igf1r haploinsufficiency in nes-igf1r-/wt mice . compared to the respective ~180% and ~234% increases in ciap- <dig> and xiap mrna in the control ipsilateral hemispheres, the abundance of ciap- <dig> and xiap mrna in the ipsilateral hemispheres of nes-igf1r-/wt mice was only increased by ~120% and ~133% , respectively.

to directly determine whether igf-i has a role in the igf1r signaling regulation of the brain iap expression, we determined iap mrna abundance in igf-i transgenic mice at  <dig> days of age, when the igf-i transgene expression peaks  <cit> . igf-i-/- mice were also used as a complimentary model. consistent with the results observed in nes-igf1r-/wt mice, blunting igf-i expression in igf-i-/- mutant mice resulted in a significantly reduced abundance of ciap- <dig> and xiap mrna in hip and cerebral cortex  . in contrast, overexpressing of igf-i in brain markedly increased the abundance of ciap- <dig> and xiap mrna in hip and ctx .

discussion
our data strongly indicate that the interaction of igf and igf1r in neuronal cells plays an important role in neuronal survival against h/i brain injury. we found that nes-igf1r-/wt mice with blunted igf1r expression specifically in nestin-expressing neuronal precursors and their progeny exhibit exacerbated h/i-induced injury. specifically, compared to normal mice these mutant mice have: 1) worsened brain edema, 2) increased rates in neuronal death, leading to greater decreases in neuron number, and 3) increased infarct area. we also show that a reduction in signaling through igf1r significantly down-regulates the mrna expression of ciap- <dig> and xiap, two iap family proteins that are capable of suppressing cell apoptosis in multiple cell types, including neurons. in contrast, overexpression of igf-i in brain increases the mrna expression of ciap- <dig> and xiap. these data suggest that the down-regulated expression of neuronal ciap- <dig> and xiap, caused by reduction in neuronal igf-igf1r signaling, contributes to the aggravated neuronal apoptosis and h/i brain injury in nes-igf1r-/wt mice.

h/i brain injury causes significant brain edema in rats that begins  <dig> minutes after injury and remains  <dig> dai  <cit> . consistently, our results show that the ipsilateral ischemic hemispheres and hippocampuses had much larger volumes than the contralateral control hemispheres and hippocampuses, and these acute increases in volume must result from edema. furthermore, when igf1r expression was halved in nes-igf1r-/wt mice, the relative increases in ipsilateral hippocampal volume induced by h/i injury were much larger, and likely represented increases in the severity of edema. this finding further supports an important role for igf-igf1r signaling in protecting brain from h/i-induced injury. because the crenestin transgene is not expressed in brain blood vessels  and brain vascular igf1r signaling and cytoarchitecture is apparently normal in nes-igf1r-/wt mice  <cit> , the aggravated brain edema in h/i-injured nes-igf1r-/wt mice is likely a result of increased responses to more severe neuronal damage. a possible compromise of blood brain barrier secondary to neuronal injury, however, cannot be excluded.

cell death in injured areas is a hallmark of the h/i-induced brain damage, and usually begins shortly after h/i and continues for several days, reaching its peak  <dig> -  <dig> dai  <cit> . in line with previous reports, we also observed abundant loss of neuronal cells during the first  <dig> days after injury. most of the observed dying/dead neuronal cells exhibited characteristics of programmed cell death , such as condensed nuclei, nuclear dna fragmentation that can be end labeled, and an increased abundance of active caspase- <dig>  our data, thus, are consistent with published data  <cit> , and indicate that under our experimental conditions the majority of dead neuronal cells underwent apoptosis, although necrosis also is likely to contribute to h/i-induced cell death. when compared to control mice, blunting igf1r expression in nes-igf1r-/wt mice resulted in  <dig> -  <dig> fold more dead cells during the first  <dig> days after injury. at  <dig> dai the number of dead cells observed was still increased but more modestly . these results indicate that biallelic igf1r expression is required for the normal survival of hippocampal neurons after h/i-induced injury, and that igf1r signaling may be more critical in neuronal survival during the first  <dig> days after injury.

it is well-documented that the expression of both igf-i and igf-ii, igf1r ligands, is temporally and spatially regulated in h/i-injured brain . alteration in serum igfs in subjects with h/i brain injury also has been reported  <cit> . while igf-i has been widely implicated in neuronal protection and repair following h/i, the functions of igf-ii in h/i brain injury is not clear. guan and co-workers  <cit>  have shown that administering igf-ii does not reduce cortical infarction induced by h/i, and that co-administration of igf-ii with igf-i abolishes the protective effects of igf-i. these data suggest that igf-ii likely has a function that differs from igf-i. under our experimental conditions it is not clear whether the igf1r exerts its neuroprotective effects by interacting with igf-i, igf-ii or both. regardless of its ligand, or the origin of these ligands, our data strongly indicate an important role for signaling through igf1r in neuronal protection following h/i injury.

ciap- <dig> and xiap, two members of iap family proteins, are capable of suppressing the activity of caspases  by either enhancing caspase degradation  or directly inhibiting their activity   <cit> . the findings that ciap- <dig> and xiap mrna is increased in igf-i overexpressing transgenic mice and markedly reduced in nes-igf1r-/wt mice and igf-i null mutant mice demonstrate that signaling through igf1r has an important role in regulating the expression of mrna for these two proteins during brain development. we further showed that following injury the expression of ciap- <dig> and xiap mrna is increased in ipsilateral hemisphere, and that these increases are dampened by igf1r haploinsufficiency. these data suggest that increased ciap- <dig> and xiap, at least in part, mediates the anti-apoptotic effects of igf signaling in cns neuronal cells during development and following h/i injury.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our data demonstrated that blunting igf1r expression specifically in neuronal cells exacerbates h/i-induced injury, and thus, are consistent with the proposition that igf-igf1r interaction in neuronal cells is critically important for their survival following h/i injury. in addition, our data showing that igf-igf1r signaling up-regulates the expression of neuronal ciap- <dig> and xiap during development and following h/i, strongly suggest that ciap- <dig> and xiap are two candidate targets for therapeutic treatment of h/i-induced brain injuries.
