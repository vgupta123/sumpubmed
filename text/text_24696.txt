BACKGROUND
ciliates, unicellular eukaryotes, are extremely species-rich and colonize a very broad spectrum of ecological niches. they are characterized by complexes of cilia, used for swimming and food capturing and by a nuclear dimorphism that is unique for ciliates. all members possess a micronuclear genome, which is active in sexual reproduction, and a macronuclear genome that is transcriptionally active during somatic development and maintenance. in addition to the macronuclear and micronuclear genomes, aerobic ciliates also possess a mitochondrial genome. although there are thousands of different ciliate species, only six mitochondrial genomes have been completely sequenced and analyzed thus far: p. aurelia  <cit>  and five tetrahymena species: t. pyriformis, t. thermophila, t. pigmentosa, t. paravorax and t. malaccensis  <cit> . only minor differences between the mitochondrial genomes of the tetrahymena species were found. the mitochondrial genomes of p. aurelia and tetrahymena species are also very similar; only two large blocks of genes are shifted between them but within these blocks the gene order is conserved. a third smaller block, containing the split mitochondrial ribosomal rnl gene, is duplicated in tetrahymena but not in paramecium. although most of the sequenced mitochondrial genomes are circular mapping, the mitochondrial genomes of paramecium and tetrahymena are monomeric linear and capped with telomeres. no mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced in the order of hypotrichous ciliates that contain intensively studied species such as oxytricha and stylonichia as well as euplotes, a genus widely distributed in freshwater and seawater environments. the two euplotes species studied here  are both marine ciliates that were collected in the mediterranean sea.

we investigated the mitochondrial genome organization of euplotes for three reasons: firstly, because euplotes is only distantly related to p. aurelia and the various tetrahymena species, the only species from which mitochondrial genomes have been studied so far . secondly, because euplotes contains two morphologically different types of mitochondria, which might possess different genomes  <cit>  and thirdly, because we assumed that euplotes is more closely related to nyctotherus ovalis than tetrahymena or paramecium. phylogenetic analysis, however, did not support this assumption because of lacking statistical support . nevertheless, it is likely that its organellar genome is closely related to the hydrogenosomal genome of nyctotherus ovalis, which exhibits characteristics of a ciliate mitochondrial genome and significant sequence similarity to certain euplotes genes. nyctotherus ovalis, which thrives in the hindgut of various cockroach species, has been investigated extensively, but only  <dig> kb of its hydrogenosomal genome have been sequenced so far  <cit> . here, we show that the mitochondrial genomes of e. crassus and e. minuta are linear with a large repeat region in the middle that is potentially involved in transcription initiation. the gene content of the euplotes genome is almost identical to that of paramecium and tetrahymena, but the order of the genes is completely different. we discuss the observation that euplotes contains extremely large cox genes and several other mitochondrial genes with large extensions. it is shown that several n-terminal extensions of the mitochondrial genes have the potential to function as mitochondrial import signals.

RESULTS
structure of the mitochondrial genomes
the linear mitochondrial dna of e. minuta has been completely sequenced with exclusion of the telomeres and a repeat region of more then  <dig> base pairs that is located almost in the middle of the mitochondrial genome. the length of the sequenced mitochondrial genome of e. minuta clearly exceeds  <dig> bp, while  <dig> bp  of the mitochondrial genome of e. crassus have been sequenced . the length of the telomeres can only be estimated roughly since it is known from investigation of  <dig> different tetrahymena species that the composition and length of mitochondrial telomeres can differ enormously  <cit> . also, in three tetrahymena species the terminal repeats at both ends of the mitochondrial dna are completely different. moreover, analysis of the mitochondrial genome of t. malaccensis has shown that telomeric lengths can vary between  <dig> and  <dig> bp with an average size of  <dig> bp.  <cit> . since pulsed field gel electrophoresis of e. minuta dna has indicated that the total length of the mitochondrial genome is clearly less than  <dig> kb , it is likely that we have sequenced the total mitochondrial genome with exception of the telomeres. this interpretation is supported by the observation that chromosome walking using organelle dna failed to provide evidence for the presence of additional dna at the ends of the sequenced mitochondrial genome.

the central repeat region is made up from 18-bp units that are palindromic except for the positions 3-4/15- <dig>  the repeat units are identical in e. crassus and e. minuta .

because the direction of transcription of all mitochondrion encoded genes is away from this repeat region , we tested whether the palindrome exhibits significant sequence similarity to any known transcription factor binding site using the online motif comparison tool tomtom  <cit> . as expected, no significant levels of sequence similarity were found . notably, it has been observed that unrelated a-t rich repeat units serve as autonomously replicating sequences in the mitochondrial dna of paramecium and tetrahymena; these units are located at one end of the mitochondrial chromosome, close to the telomeric repeats  <cit> . other examples of repeat regions in mitochondrial genomes of protists are found in the cryptophyte algae rhodomonas salina  <cit>  and hemiselmis andersenii  <cit> . both mitochondrial genomes contain a large complex repeat region that seems to play a role in transcription. however, the mitochondrial genomes of these unicellular cryptophyte algae are not linear but circular mapping.

the overall a+t content of the mitochondrial genome of e. minuta, , is much lower than in t. pyriformis  but significantly higher than in p. aurelia   <cit> . genes are tightly packed and the intergenic regions  are generally short . these intergenic regions have an overall a+t content of  <dig> % which is hardly higher than in the coding areas. we found eight cases where the orfs overlap  and no gene duplication. one gene  was split into two parts that are located on different positions of the genome.

the overall a+t content of the sequenced part of the mitochondrial genome of e. crassus is  <dig> %. the genes in the mitochondrial genome of e. crassus are also tightly packed and intergenic spacers  have a length of  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides with an average size of  <dig> nucleotides and an a+t content of  <dig> %. overlapping orfs were identified in  <dig> cases with overlaps varying in size from  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs.

the mitochondrial genes of euplotes minuta and euplotes crassus
the mitochondrial dna of e. minuta includes  <dig> protein coding genes involved in the electron transport chain,  <dig> ribosomal protein coding genes,  <dig> ribosomal rna genes,  <dig> transfer rna genes, and one gene that encodes a cytochrome c assembly protein  . finally,  <dig> orfs were found with no detectable sequence similarity to known genes . the sequenced part of the mitochondrial genome of e. crassus contains  <dig> genes of the electron transport chain,  <dig> ribosomal protein coding genes,  <dig> ribosomal rna genes,  <dig> transfer rna genes, the ccmf/jeyr gene and  <dig> orfs with significant sequence similarity to e. minuta genes, but no detectable sequence similarity to other known genes .

*: gene present, -: gene absent. ns: not sequenced, these genes are expected to be located in the not sequenced part of the mitochondrial genome of euplotes crassus

partial: only a part of this gene/orf has significant sequence similarity. ns: these orfs are located in the part of the euplotes crassus mitochondrial genome that has not been sequenced. -: no gene/orf found in this organism with significant sequence similarity. the remaining orfs in tetrahymena spp. or paramecium aurelia do not show significant sequence similarity .

there are no differences in gene order between the closely related e. crassus and e. minuta, but their gene order is completely different than that of the tetrahymena species and p. aurelia . only four genes could be found that have a conserved order in all these ciliate species: rpl2-orf-nad10-rps <dig> 

genes encoding components of the electron transport chain
as shown in table  <dig> all mitochondrion-encoded complex i genes that were found in t. pyriformis and p. aurelia  <cit> , were also found in e. minuta with the exception of nad6/ymf <dig> that was identified as nad <dig> in t. pyriformis  <cit> . the mitochondrial genomes of all sequenced tetrahymena species possess nad6/ymf <dig>  which exhibits a significant sequence similarity with orf <dig> in p. aurelia.

in all tetrahymena species and in p. aurelia the complex i gene nad <dig> is split into a larger a and a smaller b part, which is located on the opposite strand. in e. minuta this gene is also split but located on the same strand. in e. crassus the corresponding part of the mitochondrial genome has not been sequenced .

the length of the nad <dig> gene of t. pyriformis, p. aurelia and n. ovalis  is almost the same but about  <dig> amino acids smaller than the nad <dig> gene of bos taurus . in contrast, the nad <dig> genes of both euplotes species have large n terminal extensions. the nad <dig> gene of e. crassus has an extension of about  <dig> amino acids, and the homologous gene of e. minuta is around  <dig> amino acids longer. these extensions have no detectable sequence similarity to each other or to other known genes.

the complex i gene nad4l has been identified by brunk et al. in t. thermophila  <cit>  , in the hydrogenosomal genome of the anaerobic ciliate n. ovalis and in both euplotes species . it has not been annotated in paramecium, but alignments of orf <dig> in p. aurelia with the tetrahymena species and with the nad4l gene of n. ovalis shows that this orf <dig> is homologous to nad4l  <cit> . the nad <dig> genes of both euplotes species are highly conserved; both have a small n-terminal extension . these extensions are not similar to each other and are not found in other ciliates.

the only complex iii gene that is found in the mitochondrial genomes of the tetrahymena species and p. aurelia is cytochrome-b , which has also been identified in both euplotes species . the cob genes of both euplotes species possess small n-terminal extensions that are not conserved while the remaining part of the gene is very well conserved. the complex iv genes cytochrome oxidase  <dig> and  <dig> , are found in all tetrahymena species, in p. aurelia and in both euplotes species . as shown earlier in t. pyriformis and p. aurelia both genes contain large  upstream open reading frames  <cit> . in euplotes the cox <dig> frames reach extreme lengths,  <dig> amino acids in e. crassus and  <dig> amino acids in e. minuta . the insert does not show significant similarity to any known gene, precluding the inference of function and functional constraints by sequence similarity. the sequencing of two euplotes species, however, allows us to assess whether there is any selection on the protein coding sequence by calculating the ratio of non-synonymous over synonymous substitutions  and test for protein sequence conservation. figure 6a shows the clustalw alignment  <cit>  between the cox <dig> proteins in euplotes and several other ciliate species. there are only two regions that could be unequivocally aligned among all the ciliates and of which the alignment did not depend on the program used  <cit> . these regions are indicated by the high conservation and quality bars in figure  <dig>  they are also highly conserved between the two euplotes sequences , and overlap with the regions for which we detected likely sequence similarity with the pfam cox <dig> domain, albeit with an insignificant e-value for the n-terminal part  <cit> . in contrast, there appear to be less constraints on the primary sequence of the ~ <dig> amino acid in-frame cox <dig> insert . for cox <dig>  we found a similar situation  when the cox <dig> protein sequences of both euplotes species are compared with the cox <dig> protein sequence of bos taurus a large insert in frame of  <dig> amino acids was identified between positions 119- <dig>  t. pyriformis and p. aurelia possess an insert of  <dig> amino acids in exactly the same position. furthermore, it seems that the cox <dig> genes of t. pyriformis and both euplotes species contain n-terminal extensions of about  <dig> amino acids. the n-terminal extension in p. aurelia is a bit longer, about  <dig> amino acids. the n-terminal extensions of the cox <dig> gene in both euplotes species and in p. aurelia harbour a potential mitochondrial import signal that has been identified by the program mitoprot  <cit> . in a recent publication  <cit>  it was observed that latent mitochondrial targeting signals are present on the mitochondrial genomes of arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa. it is possible that some of the n-terminal extensions we find in euplotes spp. play a role as latent mitochondrial targeting signals. alternatively, they could function as an internal localization signal, resulting from a bias in nucleotide alteration, or even hint at the possibility of back-transfer of genes from the nucleus to the organelle  <cit> . furthermore, the cox <dig> gene of e. minuta possesses a c-terminal extension  that has not been found in the other ciliates, including e. crassus.

another cytochrome c related gene, ccmf/yejr, is also found in both euplotes species . it is a cytochrome c assembly protein that encodes the potential catalytic subunit of cytochrome c lyase. there is a large difference in the lengths of the ccmf/yejr genes between these ciliates. t. pyriformis  and e. minuta  have a large c-terminal extension. the corresponding extensions in p. aurelia  and e. crassus  are significantly smaller.

only one complex v gene, atpase  <dig>  has been identified in e. minuta. it is also located on the mitochondrial genomes of t. pyriformis and p. aurelia . the corresponding region in e. crassus was not sequenced.

ribosomal proteins
mitochondrial genes encoding mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are common in plants and protists but have never been found in the mitochondrial genomes of animals. ciliates possess a limited number of ribosomal proteins on their mitochondrial genomes. so far  <dig> ribosomal proteins have been identified in e. minuta . another ribosomal protein, rpl <dig> from e. crassus, which is present in all other ciliate mitochondrial genomes, has an n-terminal extension  that has no significant similarity with other known proteins. similar extensions were observed for the rpl <dig>  rps <dig> and rps <dig> genes in both ciliates e. crassus and e. minuta . when the mitochondrial genes were examined with the mitochondrial import signal prediction program mitoprot  <cit>  we found high scoring hits for all ribosomal proteins in e. minuta and all ribosomal proteins in e. crassus except one. all these ribosomal proteins also contained a predicted cleavage site. analyses of the mitochondrial ribosomal proteins of t. pyriformis and p. aurelia indicated that also some of these proteins possessed a potential import signal. an analysis based on the signal prediction programs predotar  <cit>  and targetp  <cit>  gave less hits but still identified a significant number of potential mitochondrial import signals .

bold face: significant import probability due to mitoprot prediction. italics: genes used by ueda et al.  <cit> . y: cleavage site predicted with mitoprot. n: no cleavage site predicted with mitoprot. putative n-terminal targeting sequences for ribosomal proteins were also calculated using the programs predotar  <cit>  and targetp  <cit>  *: these proteins could be imported into mitochondria according to predotar. #: these proteins could be imported into mitochondria according to targetp.

trna genes
among eukaryotes the number of mitochondrial-encoded trna genes varies from  <dig> trnas in reclinomonas americana to zero in apicomplexa  <cit> . seven different trna genes were identified in the mitochondrial genome of e. minuta  in contrast to only four such trna genes in p. aurelia    <cit> . in e. crassus only  <dig> trna genes were identified. also, in t. pyriformis a set of seven trna genes were identified i.e. trne, trnf, trnh, trnl, trnm, trnw and trny  <cit> . the mitochondrial-encoded trna for glutamine  seems to be unique for euplotes, since it was not identified in either t. pyriformis or in p. aurelia; trnl is duplicated in t. pyriformis. two different programs  did not detect a trna for tryptophan ; instead, this trna was identified as a trna for selenocystein. recently however, the presence of trnw in the mitochondrial genome of e. crassus was experimentally confirmed by turanov et al.  <cit> .

open reading frames
additional  <dig> orfs have been identified in e. minuta and  <dig> orfs in e. crassus . one orf  of e. minuta and e. crassus has, after blastx and blastn searches, detectable sequence similarity with orfs from t. pyriformis and p. aurelia . in t. thermophila the gene ymf <dig> has been identified as a putative ribosomal protein, based on physicochemical parameters of the predicted protein  <cit> . comparison of an alignment of the ymf <dig> homologs in the ciliates with the hidden markov models  in pfam, using the sensitive profile-profile based homology detection tool hhsearch  <cit>  indicates that ymf <dig> exhibits significant sequence similarity with the c-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein s <dig> . an hmm of the genes that are currently annotated as rps <dig> in the tetrahymena species and in p. aurelia indicated that they are homologous to the n-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein s <dig> . the gene length of ymf <dig> in t. thermophila is  <dig> amino acids; in p. aurelia  it has a length of  <dig> amino acids. the orthologous euplotes genes are much larger . we could not detect significant sequence similarity of the s <dig> n-terminal domain to any of the euplotes sequences.

for the remaining  <dig> orfs in e. minuta and  <dig> in e. crassus no homologous genes were found using blastx and blastn searches. however, one of these, orf <dig>  which is part of the conserved region of four genes in euplotes spp., is weakly conserved when compared to orf161/ymf <dig> in t. pyriformis and orf178-2/ymf <dig> in p. aurelia 

mitochondrial ribosomal rna genes
the mitochondrial large and small subunit ribosomal rna genes in five tetrahymena species and in p. aurelia are split into two pieces  <cit> . in all these tetrahymena species the rnl gene is duplicated. analysis of the mitochondrial genomes of e. minuta and e. crassus by blastn identified the regions were the rnl and rns genes are situated. the rnl gene in euplotes species is not duplicated as in the tetrahymena species. even by sensitive smith-waterman queries  <cit>  with selected parts of the rnl and rns sequences from other ciliate species, we did not find any indication that these genes were split in euplotes . both, the region containing the putative rnl and the region containing the putative rns, have significant sequence similarity to the rnl and the rns of the published mitochondrial ciliate ribosomal rnas. nevertheless, the regions of significant sequence similarity do not cover the complete published ribosomal rnas, prohibiting complete sequence alignment and therewith assessment as to whether these rnas are complete or interrupted. as expected, a 5s rrna gene could not be identified.

genetic code
analysis of the codon usage as described in the methods section confirmed that both euplotes species use the protozoan mitochondrial code, with tga encoding tryptophan. there are a few spurious predictions , but for all these cases we find the correct translation at an almost equal score. the prediction that tag would code for a serine in e. minuta is only based on a single aligned occurrence of the codon, caused possibly by a sequence error or a misalignment .

CONCLUSIONS
when the mitochondrial genome of t. pyriformis was published and compared with that of p. aurelia, it seemed that the mitochondrial gene order in ciliates was very well conserved  <cit> . with the determination of the mitochondrial genome of a third ciliate genus, belonging to a completely different taxon, we have shown that the gene order in mitochondrial genomes of ciliates can be very different while a similar set of genes is conserved. also the linearity of the mitochondrial chromosomes is conserved. this might suggest that monomeric linear mitochondrial chromosomes, which are relatively rare among protozoa and animals  <cit> , are characteristic for ciliates. this possibility is corroborated by the observation that also species belonging to the sister taxon apicomplexa possess linear mitochondrial chromosomes  <cit> . however, it should be noted that among yeasts even the mitochondrial genomes of closely related species differ with respect to their linearity/circularity  <cit> .

from the  <dig> unidentified open reading frames in the mitochondrial genome of euplotes minuta two could be found with significant sequence similarity to t. pyriformis and p. aurelia . this contrasts with the situation in t. pyriformis and p. aurelia where  <dig> out of the  <dig> unidentified open reading frames in t. pyriformis were also found in p. aurelia  <cit> . one of these orfs, ymf <dig>  has now, with the aid of the euplotes sequences and profile based homology searches been shown to be significantly similar to a known protein domain, the c-terminal part of the rps <dig> protein. this suggests that with the sequencing of more mitochondrial genomes of the ciliates also for other orfs sequence similarity might be detected with known mitochondrial genes.

one of the rare mitochondrial features present in the mitochondrial genomes of t. pyriformis and p. aurelia is a split nad <dig> gene. this split gene has also been identified in euplotes and thus seems to be specific for a large group of  ciliates.

one of the most striking differences between the mitochondrial genomes of euplotes and those of tetrahymena species and p. aurelia is the presence of a large repeat region in the middle of the mitochondrial genome of both euplotes species that seems to be used as a bi-directional transcription start. no such repeat was found in tetrahymena species and p. aurelia and, in contrast to euplotes, the transcription direction changes several times.

another striking feature of the genes in the mitochondrial genome of euplotes species is the presence of very large open reading frames. most of these large orfs contain n-terminal extensions, but in some cases, like the cox <dig> and cox <dig> genes, large inserts in frame cause this effect. such inserts in frame were also detected in tetrahymena sp. and p. aurelia. surprisingly, all of the n-terminal extensions of genes encoding ribosomal proteins of euplotes minuta contain a potential targeting signal for import into mitochondria. this is the first report identifying such import signals in mitochondrial-encoded genes in organisms other than plants.

sequencing and analyzing the mitochondrial genomes of e. crassus and e. minuta shows that the mitochondrial genomes of ciliates are rearranged more extensively than previously thought. sequencing of the mitochondrial genome of e. minuta also did not provide any evidence for the presence of a slightly deviating, alternative genome that might be expected for the two morphs of mitochondria observed in this species. studying these mitochondrial genomes has provided additional information about the evolution of mitochondria in general and in particular about the evolution of the elusive hydrogenosomal genome of nyctotherus ovalis  <cit> , which appeared to be more related to the mitochondrial genome of euplotes than to those of paramecium and tetrahymena.
