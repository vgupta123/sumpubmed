BACKGROUND
the development of high-throughput technologies, such as gene or proteinn microarrays, has provided the scenario of the state of cells by monitoring the expression levels of hundreds or thousands of biological inputs  for a few number  of experimental units measured under different clinical conditions. a challenging problem within this domain is the identification of inputs or interactions of them highly correlated to the outcome. the low sample-high dimensional  structure of the data we handle makes this challenge a difficult task, in particular when we are concerned with the detection of bivariate interactions. some papers that tackle this problem using indexes of pairwise feature association are  <cit> , which introduced the tsp score, and  <cit>  which defined the corscor index by the changes in the intra-class correlation coefficient and explores the feature space looking for gap/substitution and on/off association patterns. these approaches assume a specified shape for the interaction.

in this paper we address the problem by evaluating the performance of a classification rule trained on the data at hand; hopefully, this will enrich the typology of interactions that might be hidden in the data. one of the main drawbacks for facing up this problem is the well known peaking phenomenon; it consists of the deterioration of the performance of the designed classifier when the number of inputs increases and many noisy variables are involved in fitting the classifier, so the signal gets masked and the classifier confuses it with the noise. there is a great deal of literature discussing this phenomenon; some recent papers  <cit>  study the problem within a general framework and  <cit>  tackles it in the context of feature selection.

the peaking phenomenon is more acute for weak marginal/strong bivariate signals as pointed out in  <cit> , that is, for highly predictive interactions having useless marginal distributions for classifying the outcome. this paper studies the peaking phenomenon for this type of bivariate interaction patterns. we propose a search procedure which utilizes the error rate of the quadratic discriminant analysis  classifier to carry out an exploration of the feature space in order to find such signals. the use of the qda classifier will hopefully enlarge the type of patterns of bivariate differential expression uncovered by the aforementioned methods tsp and corscor.

methods
motivation
this section gives a detailed description of how weak marginal/strong bivariate interactions are lost by different classification rules as the dimension of the feature space increases and many noise predictors are involved in training the classifier. for the sake of simplicity we confine ourselves to the binary classification problem, where n <dig> and n <dig> observations are drawn from each one of the categories of the outcome variable.

weak marginal/strong bivariate interactions
four examples of weak marginal/strong bivariate interaction patterns are given by the following synthetic scenarios.

scenario 1
the observations are drawn from bivariate random variable z =  in accordance with the following scheme: the conditional distribution of z|y =  <dig> —black labels— is bivariate normal with mean vector µ <dig> = ; meanwhile, the other class conditional distribution for z|y =  <dig> —red labels— is bivariate normal with mean vector µ <dig> = . we assume both distributions have the same covariance matrix given by  

scenario  <dig> 
the observations for the xor pair are drawn from a bivariate random variable x =  in accordance with the following scheme: the conditional distribution of the random variable x|y =  <dig> —black labels— is uniform over the quadrants . on the other hand, x|y =  <dig> —red labels— has a uniform distribution over .

scenario  <dig> 
cases are simultated from a bivariate normal distribution r =  with vector means µ =  and covariance matrix the indentity i. the labels are assigned in accordance to the following rules: if  then y =  <dig> —black labels— and if  then y =  <dig> —red labels.

scenario  <dig> 
observations in this situation are drawn from uniform distributions confined to the domain . the interaction between the pair v =  and the outcome variable y is given by the following rules: v|y =  <dig> —black labels— has a uniform distribution over , with . on the other hand, v|y =  <dig> —red labels— has a uniform distribution over , with .

the peaking phenomenon
we consider the previous synthetic scenarios and generate samples of sizes n <dig> = n <dig> =  <dig>  for each scenario, we add j independent noisy features, j =  <dig>   <dig> …,  <dig>  with standard normal distribution and estimate the error rate for the following four classification rules: adaboost  <cit> , random forests   <cit> , a support vector machine  with polynomial kernel  <cit>  and the qda classifier  <cit>  . the error rate is estimated by 10-fold cross validation. the results are shown in the plots of figure  <dig> 

note that the error rate of the polynomial kernel in scenario  <dig> is high, around  <dig> , when only the variables of the pair  are used as predictors. this ugly performance is related to the type of polynomial kernel we used, a second order polynomial kernel, which is well suited for tracing nonlinear quadratic patterns but poor for identifying linear decision boundaries as in scenario 1; see the improvement of svm classifier in scenarios  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> where it makes a better job with the non linear interaction patterns ,  and  tracing the separation between the classes.

in addition, we can observe that the error rate deteriorates as the number of features increases; this shows the peaking phenomenon for weak marginal/strong bivariate interactions. the qda resistance to peaking compares to rf and adaboost, with the exception of scenario  <dig> when p < 20; see that the error rates are nearly similar, specially for a number of inputs under  <dig> or  <dig>  in addition, the qda has the appealing property of requiring a low computational cost for training the classifier; this fact is crucial in the design of the search strategy since our procedure will explore the feature space in an almost exhaustive way by fitting thousands of times the qda classifier.

comparative study for a benchmark of classification rules
the cma package  <cit>  from bioconductor project repositories in  <cit>  provides an interface for the analysis of genomic data. one of the utilities of cma is the possibility to carry out a comparative study of the performance of classifiers for a benchmark of classification rules.

in this section we revisit the effect of the peaking phenomenon for a selection of classifiers from the cma package: k-nearest neighbors  and neural networks   <cit> , diagonal , linear  and quadratic  discriminant analysis as in  <cit> , partial least squares with lda, logistic regresion and rf variants  as in  <cit> , pam classifier  as introduced in  <cit> , random forests  <cit> , the componentwise boosting  introduced in  <cit> , the elasticnet  <cit>  and two versions of the svm  with second order polynomial and radial kernels respectively. the error rate was estimated by 10-fold cross validation.

the function compare gives a picture of how these classifiers compare one with each other. for each one, it displays the boxplot of the error rate over the  <dig> validation sets.

the data sets were generated by drawing n <dig> = n <dig> =  <dig> samples from scenarios  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the boxplots in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> give a glance of the performance of the classifiers. the experiment was carried out for p =  <dig> , p =  <dig>  and p =  <dig>  features. we can see that qda outperforms the remaining classification rules in almost all the scenarios. it is of special interest the xor interaction pattern as pointed out in  <cit> ; in this case, all these simulations have shown that the performance of all the classifiers deteriorates when the number of features reaches p =  <dig>  it is worth noting that for p under  <dig>  the most resistant classifier to peaking for the xor signal is qda; meanwhile, for p =  <dig> all the classifiers are highly affected by peaking in the xor scenario . so we conclude that qda is a good candidate for designing a search strategy that uncovers this type of interaction patterns.

a closer look at qda and its resistance to peaking
now we explore with more detail the resistance of qda classification rule to peaking by means of a simulation study.

recall that binary qda is concerned with the discrimination between two p-dimensional multivariate normal class conditional populations n and n, where µ <dig> and µ <dig> are the mean vectors and Σ <dig> and Σ <dig> are the covariance matrices. the decision boundary corresponding to the qda classification rule is given by  

with  and π <dig>  π <dig> the a priori class probabilities. when we are dealt with balanced classes π <dig> = π <dig> =  <dig> .

when the sample estimates , , ,  of the covariances and the means are plugged in the expression above, we obtain the qda designed classifier.

the previous decision boundary defines an hyperquadric whose shape depends on the elements involved in the difference of inverses , more specifically on the product of its eigenvalues. this yields to elliptical, hyperbolic, parabolic or linear boundaries; see  <cit>  for details. thus, the variety of patterns recognized by qda is rich enough to consider it a good classification rule for pattern discovery. we now carry out a simulation experiment in order to study its resistance to peaking for weak marginal/strong bivariate interactions.

we have drawn  <dig> observations  according to patterns in scenarios  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  along with  <dig> cases from p –  <dig> independent standard normal variables, which are uninformative features for class prediction. on the order hand, we have generated n <dig> + n <dig> =  <dig> samples from p independent standard normal variables and obtain a data set with only noisy features. the error rate of the qda classifier was estimated by 10-fold cross validation for each data set. we repeated the experiment b =  <dig> times in order to get both populations of error rates: with the signal and with only noisy features. we have considered feature spaces with p =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> predictors.

the boxplots of figures  <dig> and  <dig> show the results of the simulations. the amount of overlap between both populations is shown for each p in parenthesis. this overlap was measured by one of the alternatives widely used in the statistical practice: the well known measure Φ, with Φ the distribution function of the standard normal variable and ∆ the mahalanobis distance. this measure has an appealing theoretical flavor since it provides the overall error rate of the linear discriminant classifier when the multivariate normality within the classes and the equality of class covariance matrices assumptions are met; see  <cit> . note that the amount of overlap between both populations is always less than 5% when the number of predictors is smaller than  <dig>  which means that qda classification rule is able to distinguish between chunks of inputs containing a weak marginal/strong bivariate signal and chunks with only noisy features, provided that the size of the chunk is not greater than  <dig>  as p increases, the amount of overlap becomes larger; therefore the qda would be unable to catch the signal and might confuse it with the noise.

the qda interaction detector procedure
the results of the simulations have shown that qda resistance threshold to peaking can be set at p =  <dig> , when we are concerned with the detection of weak marginal/strong bivariate interactions in high dimensional data sets. this finding is crucial and puts the basis of the search strategy we will design to uncover this type of interaction patterns. the rationale behind this strategy is as follows. the naive solution would explore the feature space in an exhaustive way by fitting a qda classifier to each pair of variables; a high accurate classification would be highlighting the presence of a signal. obviously, this alternative is time consuming prohibitive since it would require a total of p/ <dig> qda fits; for example, if p =  <dig> then  <dig> fits are needed.

our search strategy proceeds in a nearly exhaustive way by dividing the feature space in small blocks of features of a specified size bsize and by fitting the qda for all pairs of blocks. as we know that qda is resistant to peaking while the number of features ranges between p* =  <dig> and p* =  <dig>  we propose to take bsize such that  <dig> ∗ bsize ≤ p*; in this way we protect ourselves against the danger of peaking when the qda classifier is fit with all the features belonging to the union of both blocks. once the qda classifiers are obtained for all the possible matchings of blocks, we know that for a matching containing a bivariate interaction pattern, the classifier will give a very low error rate; meanwhile, for a block matching with only noisy features we will obtain a high error rate. thus, we can construct a ranking of block matchings, where the top ranked matchings will contain the informative bivariate interaction patterns, and the matchings at the bottom of the ranking carrying on only noisy features. now, at a second stage we can restrict the search to the subset of features belonging to the top ranked matchings of blocks. for example if we confine the search to the  <dig> ∗ bsize features of the first block matching, we would need to explore bsize × bsize interactions in order to find out which one of them is responsible for the observation of such a low error rate in the qda; usually this search is very low time consuming since bsize is smaller than  <dig> 

searching in the feature space in a blockwise manner has an enormous advantage with respect to the exhaustive search; for example, if p =  <dig> and we take bsize =  <dig>  we would obtain  <dig> blocks; so the search would need only  <dig> qda fits, much less than the  <dig> fits of the naive solution.

this procedure has been implemented using the r platform for statistical computing downloaded from  <cit> . the following steps summarizes the main stages.  

it is recommended to carry out a first screening step in order to filter the strong marginal features highly correlated with the outcome before applying the search procedure. recall that our search strategy was designed to uncover the weak marginal/strong bivariate interactions which are usually rejected by traditional sequential search procedures or pre-screening filtering tools .

RESULTS
a simulation example for synthetic data
let n <dig> = n <dig> =  <dig> be the class sizes. the cases were drawn from p-dimensional random vectors, , ,  and  corresponding to scenarios  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  with e =  a vector of independent noisy standard normal variables added to the signal. for p =  <dig> the signal represents 1% of a 200-dimensional feature space.

we have applied the qda interaction detector procedure with bsize =  <dig> to the previous synthetic scenarios and have obtained the ranking of block matchings. as we have discussed, this ranking is a useful tool that allows to restrict the search for the hidden interaction patterns by exploring its top ranked positions. figure  <dig> displays the heat matrix of qda errors for all the bivariate interactions obtained from the first position of the ranking of block matchings. light yellow and orange shades represent a high error rate while the red color represents a low error rate.

note that the procedure has found interaction patterns ,  and . the red hot squares of scenarios  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in figure  <dig> highlight the weak marginal/strong bivariate interaction hidden in the matching. these matrices may also provide a useful tool for identifying different types of weak marginal/strong bivariate signals: for example the first row of red squares in scenario  <dig> is highlighting the not so weak behavior of component v <dig> in the v-shaped pattern. on the other hand, the isolated red hot spot in scenario  <dig>  surrounded by light yellow and orange spots, might be explaining the weak predictive power of the components in the xor interaction, where both variables behave as noisy features.

an application to real data: the colon cancer dataset
the colon cancer data set is a publicly available experiment which can be obtained from the package colonca in  <cit> . gene expression levels for  <dig> genes across  <dig> tumor and  <dig> normal tissue samples were collected with affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays  <cit> . the data were preprocessed by a log transformation and standardization across genes.

random forests  outlier detector utility identified cases  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as outliers. these were previously identified in  <cit>  as aberrant observations and will be removed from the analysis.

data analysis and findings
the table of variable importance of rf identifies the most influential genes for class prediction. we took as a measure of importance the mean decrease gini score; we utilized the values ntree =  <dig> for the number of trees in the forest and the default for mtry, the number of eligible splitters. figure  <dig> shows the screeplot for the variable importance scores. after a deep decay, we find a long plateau which begins at an elbow located at position  <dig> of the ranking.

we pick up the first one hundred genes of rf table of variable importance. the list has a great agreement with other previous selections in the literature, in particular with that one in  <cit> . table  <dig> shows the identifiers of the genes of the list . we put them aside and retain the remaining ones for the application of qda interaction detector procedure.

application of the qda interaction detector procedure
after putting aside the biomarkers identified in the screening step and eliminating a few duplicated columns, we end up with a data set containing  <dig> features along with the binary outcome.

before applying the procedure, we set bsize =  <dig>  figure  <dig> displays the heat matrix plots of the error rate given by qda classification rule for all the bivariate associations obtained by pairwise matching of the variables belonging to the six top positions of the ranking of block matchings.

the heat matrix plots reveal interesting interactions among features which were considered useless by rf ranking of variable importance at the initial screening step. four bivariate interactions are standing out; they correspond to the interaction of the genes at columns: , ,  and  which come from the first, third, fourth and fifth positions of the ranking of block matchings. these associations correspond to the following gene to gene interactions: , ,  and . the scatter plots in figure  <dig> contain the type of bivariate interaction pattern displayed by each one of them.

note that none of the genes in the scatterplots exhibit univariate differential expression since both classes of the outcome do overlap when projected on the axes. however, if both genes are considered together, they discriminate the binary outcome; such discrimination stems from the bivariate association between them. they are four cases of weak marginal/strong bivariate gene interaction patterns uncovered by our procedure.

comparative analysis with tsp and corscor methods




CONCLUSIONS
this paper has explored the peaking phenomenon in the context of detecting marginal/strong bivariate interactions in high dimensional settings. the appealing properties of the qda classifier and its resistance to peaking has justified its use as a search engine of a procedure that explores the feature space in order to look for this type of signals in high dimensional data.

the method was applied both to artificial data and to a real microarray gene expression experiment, the colon cancer data set. the application to real data has led to promising results providing gene interactions that exhibit bivariate differential expression but are not differentially expressed when considered marginally. the results show the usefulness of qda interaction detector procedure, which is expected to become an efficient tool for biologists and bioinformaticians for the discovery of new gene to gene interactions.

the proposed method has been developed for binary classification; the analysis for multi-class problems is a natural extension for conducting future research efforts. some research regarding the computational cost involved in the qda interaction detector search strategy is also an issue for further improvements.
