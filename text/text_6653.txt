BACKGROUND
micrornas  are short non-coding rna molecules of ~ <dig> nucleotides  that can affect stability and/or translation of mrnas. in mammals, the primary transcript  is processed into a precursor  of ~ <dig> nt with a characteristic stem-loop structure by the enzyme, drosha, and then the pre-mirna is transported from nucleus to cytoplasm by exportin- <dig>  the dicer nuclease cuts out the mature mirna from one strand of the pre-mirna, and loads it into rna-induced silencing complex   <cit> . finally, the cleavage or translational repression is induced, depending on the degree of base pairing between risc-mirna and target mrna  <cit> .

the first mirna, lin- <dig>  was discovered in the lab of victor ambros in  <dig>  <cit> , which was complementary to the 3'utr  of the mrna transcribed from the lin- <dig> gene. seven years later, the second mirna let- <dig> was found in gary ruvkun's lab  <cit> . subsequently, mirnas have become a hot spot and a large number of mirnas have been identified in various species across time  <cit> . there are  <dig> mature mirna products, according to the release  <dig>  of mirbase  <cit> . mirnas are integral components in many biological processes including development, differentiation, apoptosis, etc. moreover, unexpected novel functions have been discovered recently. however, the experimental techniques are difficult to systematically detect mirna molecules under the assumption that highly diverse functions and activities are involved in biological processes.

at present, computational methods, including comparative and non-comparative methods, prove good at identifying mirna precursor from both pseudo mirna and other ncrna , which are also available for human pre-mirna recognition. xue et al.  presented a classifier  based on support vector machine to classify human pre-mirna from pseudo hairpin with structure-sequence triplet features. mipred extended the triplet-svm, using the random forest algorithm based on hybrid features to improve the classification results  <cit> . to the contrary, mipred and micropred regarded some other ncrnas  as a negative training/testing dataset for the reason that pseudo hairpin structures can be found in the complete secondary structures of other types of ncrnas and their motifs. therefore, a proper approach for novel human pre-mirna recognition should distinguish real pre-mirna hairpins effectively, from both genome pseudo hairpins and other ncrnas  <cit> .

almost all pre-mirnas have characteristic stem-loop hairpin structures, which are thought to provide insight into the biological function  <cit> . during the biogenesis of a mature mirna, hairpin structure acts as a structure motif for exportin- <dig> in the nuclear-cytoplasm transportation and a substrate for dicer  <cit> , and it is also of great importance in the specific nucleotide base-paring and stacking interactions. in the rna folding, the adopted shapes or folds can be highly complex while capable of carrying out a variety of molecular functions, such as binding metabolites and proteins with high specificity  <cit> . genomic regions are also binding targets for rnas allowing for their hybridization with nucleotide sequences  <cit> . as for researches into microrna function, the identification of mirna targets using computational methods has developed in an increasing number. recent improvements in this field have been reported in li j et al  <cit> , target-align  <cit> , mirontop  <cit> , etc.

recent studies showed various ways to represent rna structure with graphs , such as bracketed, tree, dual graph, etc. these representations specify the connectivity between rna secondary structural elements, such as loops, bulges, stems and junctions  <cit> . they facilitate the detection of numerous detailed facets of each pre-mirna element and their combined patterns in creating pre-mirna secondary structure. thus, a parameter can be defined on the level of network constituents  or the network itself. in this work, we describe a pre-mirna secondary structure as a two-dimensional network , and then several network parameters are defined and analyzed. based on these parameters, a random forest  approach is used to construct prediction model for pre-mirna. this classifier is trained on animal pre-mirna sequences with <90% similarity and achieves high accuracies across independent datasets.

RESULTS
prediction performance of rf classifier
training/testing model
embedded in the procedure of estimating classifier performance, the parameter optimization is done by grid search. during the process of the grid search, two parameters, ntree  and mtry  are optimized based on 10-fold cross-validation. the original value is ntree = { <dig>   <dig>  500} and mtry = { <dig>  mdim, 1} . the best performed parameters  are selected to construct random forest prediction models. a similar method of parameter optimization was also successful in predicting mirna targets  <cit> .

a rf model is constructed with training dataset and tested by testing dataset. our dataset contains  <dig> positive samples  and  <dig> negative samples .  <dig> samples from each class are randomly selected for training, and the rest are for testing. this procedure is repeated  <dig> times and the true positive rates  and the true negative rates  are averaged to determine the performance. our method achieves sensitivity of  <dig>  and specificity of  <dig> . comparing with previous report, our approach is well performed, as redundant sequences are filtered out with a threshold of 90% identity while others only get rid of duplicate sequences. the stricter data preprocessing reduces the bias of prediction results yielded by redundant data.

roc curves for testing datasets represent the distribution of  <dig> times experiments with box plot, in which the middle bar is the median, the outer edges are the  <dig> and  <dig> percentiles, and the edges of the boxes are the  <dig> and  <dig> percentiles. outliers are showed as circles. an average auc value of  <dig>  is obtained with all network parameters . the result further suggests that network represented stem-loop secondary structure can be used to construct model for effectively predicting novel pre-mirna.

performance of independent dataset
in order to evaluate the practical prediction ability of the final prediction model, two independent datasets are used, which contains  <dig> known plants and  <dig> virus pre-mirna sequences, respectively. table  <dig> shows the results on the independent datasets. sequences with similarity greater than 90% are excluded from original dataset. our model achieves high accuracies of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. a total accuracy of  <dig>  indicates that our method is reliable and robust. network parameters can be used to identify pre-mirna sequences with high performance. in contrast, most existing methods only work on the pre-mirnas with no multiple loops, and do not filter out the high similarity sequences. the pre-mirnas sharing high sequence similarities induces biased evaluation of the prediction model in this manner.

triplet-svm is a svm-based method with triplet elements that represent information of pre-mirna stem-loop structure. there is an extension called mipred.

micropred combined the new rnafold-related, mfold-related, and pair-related features with  <dig> 'global and intrinsic' features introduced in the mipred approach.

a  <dig> virus and  <dig> plant sequences were used, as samples with multiple loops were filtered out by triplet-svm.

b  <dig> virus and  <dig>  plant sequences were submitted to micropred web server.

contribution of individual parameter
in the present work, two different strategies are adopted to measure the contribution of individual parameter to the prediction of pre-mirna. because predicting the response with "black-box" model alone cannot fully satisfy the requirements in the current classification tasks.

rf is a classification method that also provides feature importance measures, with which significant features would be distinguished and interactions among features would also be reduced as well. permutation importance and conditional variable importance are adopted as criteria for measuring the contribution of individual parameter in pre-mirna prediction. this process is repeated  <dig> times with random resampling of constructed models, and the scores are averaged. the contribution of each network parameter is measured and showed in figure  <dig> 

the average degree exhibits the greatest contribution with an average score of  <dig>  followed by the variance of betweenness , the average burt's constraint , and three graph motifs . these parameters significantly contribute to the performance of the model and are consistent with the results from permutation and conditional variable importance strategies. however, the latter based on conditional inference trees seems to produce less noise than a permutation importance strategy. in addition, this analysis suggests that girth, coreness and transitivity have a limited or no contribution to the prediction. subsequently, we rank the features by average score of each parameter, and delete one feature of the lowest score each time and construct models with features remained. this procedure is repeated  <dig> times, till only one feature is left. the average prediction results for each model are showed in figure  <dig>  the complete parameter set is tested in the classifier that achieves sensitivity of  <dig>  and specificity of  <dig> . elimination of lower scored parameters does not lead to significant change of the model performance. when the top  <dig> parameters are remained, the sensitivity is  <dig>  and specificity is  <dig> , decreasing by  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, comparing to the results from the total feature sets. these results further confirm the above experiment, and the top  <dig> parameters are of great contribution to pre-mirna prediction.

comparing the practical prediction ability with previous methods
several pre-mirna prediction tools were released and each had its own merits. however, these tools suffered from imbalance problem, that is, the negative dataset was much larger than the positive dataset. the triplet-svm, mipred and mipred all randomly chose more balanced positive and negative dataset from the complete dataset as the training data. meanwhile, the remaining positives and other randomly chosen negatives were as the testing samples. instead, micropred used smote  to address this imbalance problem. however, smote and random over-sampling methods augment the minority class through all the samples or a random subset of the minority class. over-sampling makes exact copies of the minority class, which tends to result in over-fitting of the model. thus, these methods increase the size of the training set to build a classifier, which likely yields overestimated prediction ability. in addition, existing methods haven't considered redundant owing to high similarity sequence, which results in biased evaluation of the prediction performance. here,  <dig> samples are randomly selected from  <dig> non-redundant animal sequences with less than 90% similarity and  <dig> negative samples , respectively. the remainder samples are used for testing model. finally,  <dig> plants and  <dig> virus sequences <90% similarity are used to evaluate the practical prediction ability of the final prediction model and compare with that of the previous tools.

we perform a comparison on the independent dataset, and the result is listed in table  <dig>  triplet elements were first proposed in triplet-svm, which combined the local contiguous sequence and structure information of the stem-loop secondary structure of pre-mirna  <cit> . this feature representation could be effectually applied in pre-mirna identification, which was further proved and improved by recent study  <cit> . the micropred presented  <dig> multifaceted features, including  <dig> conventional features originally used in the mipred approach and  <dig> newly introduced rnafold-related, mfold-related, and pair-related features  <cit> . in our approach, a novel representation of pre-mirna structure is proposed by translating characteristic stem-loop structure into network and generating  <dig> network features for random forest classification. the independent dataset test indicates that all three methods perform well, and our model performs best.

besides, we have also implemented our method on the same positive and negative datasets previously used. we train our model with the same training data as that of the triplet-svm, and test model performance with the same testing data used in triplet-svm. as a result, all the  <dig> human pre-mirnas are correctly recognized, while  <dig> out of  <dig> pseudo-mirnas are defected as negative by our method. comparing with triplet-svm, this method significantly improves the performance of prediction. moreover, we try our approach on positive and negative datasets originally used in micropred, yielding sensitivity of  <dig>  and specificity of  <dig> . the micropred was time-consuming, as a large number of random sequences were generated for calculating statistical thermodynamic features. our method not only yields high accuracy, but also greatly reduces the computation time. this result demonstrates that our method is robust and effective. network parameters can be considered as a complement to feature extraction of previous work, using in comprehensive and systematic feature analysis for pre-mirna prediction.

CONCLUSIONS
microrna investigation not only sheds new light on rna function, but also reveals the mechanism involved in cell function and regulation. current methods use sequence, triplet structure-sequence, and thermodynamic properties to construct prediction model of pre-mirna. in the present study, we design a novel representation of pre-mirna secondary structures for modelling pre-mirna classifier. the graph theory is applied in analyzing rna structure recently, and some of the relevant biological relations can be explained. for instance, the node betweenness is thought to measure the number of base pairs existed in the structure and the compactness of structure to a small extent. likewise, the articulation point is regarded as a nucleotide in a dangling end or a bridge between two separable secondary structures  <cit> . however, further researches of biological interpretations for graph properties are in demand. as more and more new methods have been proposed, we are highly assured that understanding microrna and complex biological processes they influence could unlock the secrets of their function.
