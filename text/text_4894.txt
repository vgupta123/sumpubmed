BACKGROUND
microcin j <dig>  is a  <dig> -da peptide antibiotic which is constituted by  <dig> unmodified amino acids and is excreted to the culture medium by e. coli strains harboring the mccj25-coding plasmid  <cit> . uptake of this antibiotic into e. coli is dependent on the outer-membrane receptor fhua  <cit>  and the inner membrane proteins tonb, exbb, exbd, and sbma  <cit> . energy provided by the proton motive force of the cytoplasmic membrane and the tonb–exbb–exbd protein complex is required for active transport through fhua  <cit> . once inside the sensitive cell, the peptide is able to inhibit e. coli rna polymerase  and the membrane respiratory chain  <cit> .

this antibiotic is active against bacteria related to the producer strain such as salmonella, shigella and e. coli, while other enterobacteriaceae are resistant  <cit> . then, it is possible to say that mccj <dig> shows, in vitro, a narrow action spectrum. currently, we are interested in mccj <dig> action on salmonella, a facultative intracellular pathogen responsible for a variety of diseases in a wide range of animal species. in humans, this pathogen may cause gastroenteritis , septicemia and typhoid fever. several salmonella enterica strains showed high sensitivity to mccj <dig>  while others like s. typhimurium, s. derby, and some s. enteritidis strains were completely resistant  <cit> . since, transforming resistant salmonella strains with a plasmid coding for the e. coli fhua gene rendered them hypersensitive to the antibiotic, we concluded that the intrinsic resistance is due to the inability of the salmonella fhua protein to mediate the mccj <dig> uptake  <cit> . in fact, mccj <dig> was able to inhibit both intracellular targets in the resistant salmonella strains carrying e. coli fhua <cit> . based on these results it was postulated that the outer membrane is the principal barrier that mccj <dig> has to overcome to reach its targets.

recently, we demonstrated that the membrane permeabilizing peptide, 3k, allows the mccj <dig> uptake independently of fhua and sbma receptors thus turning microcin naturally resistant strains into susceptible ones  <cit> . moreover, the same effect of 3k on s. typhimurium susceptibility to mccj <dig> was observed in bacteria replicating within eukaryotic cells. furthermore, an interesting observation was that mccj <dig> itself was able to inhibit 30% of the s. typhimurium intracellular replication  <cit> . the goal of the present study was to address the mechanism causing this phenomenon. our data demonstrate that the low ph affects the bacterial membrane permeability in vitro, indicating that this mechanism could be also responsible for the s. typhimurium sensitization once it is phagocytized and transferred to vacuoles.

RESULTS
effect of macrophages internal environment on s. typhimurium sensitivity to mccj25
we previously showed that, although s. typhimurium is a mccj25-resistant strain in vitro, its intracellular replication was moderately inhibited by the antibiotic   <cit> . in the present work we observed that the number of surviving s. typhimurium cells within macrophages decreased 60% after  <dig> h of mccj <dig> exposition compared with the control . this effect was strongly increased with time, reaching between an 80-90% of intracellular replication inhibition after  <dig> h of mccj <dig> treatment . a potential explanation for this effect is an unspecific mccj <dig> uptake produced when the pathogen grows within macrophages. in order to prove this hypothesis we determined, in vitro, the mccj <dig> sensitivity of s. typhimurium cells grown for  <dig> h within macrophages in the absence of the antibiotic . we observed a 58% viability decrease when bacteria directly harvested from macrophages  were incubated with mccj <dig> for  <dig> h, compared with the control  . additionally, we determined the mccj <dig> sensitivity of bacteria grown on lb medium and resuspended in triton x- <dig>  and no mccj <dig> effect on bacterial viability was observed .

low ph effect on susceptibility of s. typhimurium to mccj25
when bacteria replicate within eukaryotic cells, many changes in the membrane are produced in response to the internal environment. for example, acidic conditions, low magnesium and iron concentrations are some of the host-cell internal conditions to which the bacteria must adapt to  <cit> . as we observed that mccj <dig> affects in vitro the viability of s. typhimurium previously replicated within macrophages , we investigated which macrophage environmental condition would allow an unspecific mccj <dig> uptake. when bacteria were grown under low magnesium concentration  or under iron deprivation , no changes in mccj25-resistance was observed . on the contrary, when bacteria were cultured with mccj <dig>  in acidic medium , the number of cfu ml- <dig>  was  <dig> orders of magnitude lower than the bacteria grown without the antibiotic, after  <dig> h . as expected, no antibiotic effect of mccj <dig> was observed when ph  <dig> medium was used in a similar assay .

furthermore, we studied the effect of low ph on the sensitivity to mccj <dig> of a mccj25-resistant e. coli strain. for this, we determined the antibiotic sensitivity of mc <dig> fhua::km strain  in m <dig> medium plates either at ph  <dig> or ph  <dig> . as expected, this strain became susceptible to the antibiotic at ph  <dig>  , while at ph  <dig>  the bacterium was resistant . since the fhua gene is totally deleted in the mc <dig> fhua::km strain, we could assume that the sensitivity changes observed in both e. coli fhua  and s. typhimurium are mediated by an fhua-independent mccj <dig> uptake.

taken together, our results suggest that low ph could alter the outer membrane permeability letting mccj <dig> to reach its intracellular targets and consequently to inhibit the bacterial growth. furthermore, the high mccj <dig> concentration required to inhibit s. typhimurium growth at low ph or within macrophages is indicative of the unspecific nature of the antibiotic uptake. our interpretation is supported by the observation that a variety of stresses can produce a modification in the outer membrane barrier of gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . alakomi et al. <cit>  reported that lactic acid  was capable of permeabilizing e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. typhimurium by disrupting the outer membrane. thongbai et al. <cit>  proposed that exposure to low ph can alter the outer membrane permeability barrier and allow lethal compounds, normally unable to penetrate, to go through the modified bacterial membrane. in agreement with our data, authors reported that s. typhimurium cells, at ph  <dig> , lose the outer membrane integrity allowing cetylpyridinium chloride -nisin access to the cytoplasmic membrane which results in the cell death  <cit> .

yamaguchi et al. <cit>  showed that the lower the ph of the medium, the higher the accumulation of tetracycline in e. coli. in this report, authors concluded that the molecule taken up across the membrane is a protonated form of tetracycline. in this sense, we considered the possibility that mccj <dig> could become more hydrophobic under low ph thereby favoring entry into the cell. to rule out this possibility, we performed an assay where only bacteria were exposed to low ph effect. for this, bacteria were previously incubated in m <dig> medium either at ph  <dig> or  <dig>  for different times, washed with pbs  and then treated for  <dig> h with mccj <dig> . as seen in figure  <dig>  bacteria preincubated for  <dig> and  <dig> h at ph  <dig>  were susceptible to the antibiotic, while those preincubated at ph  <dig> remained resistant. these results suggest that low ph makes resistant bacteria susceptible to mccj <dig> by significantly changing the bacterial physiology rather than by modifying mccj <dig> hydrophobicity.

ofek et al. <cit>  proposed that resistance to novobiocin in gram-negative enteric bacteria is probably due to the inability of the antibiotic to penetrate the outer membrane. based on this, vaara and vaara  <cit>  used the sensitization of s. thypimurium to novobiocin as an indicator of outer membrane permeability changes in the presence of cationic agents. in a similar manner, we studied if the s. thypimurium resistance to novobiocin was circumvented by growing bacteria in acidic ph condition. to this end, we determined cfu ml- <dig> at different times after exposure to novobiocin . as expected, we observed that  <dig>  μm novobiocin did not affect s. thypimurium growth at neutral ph whereas at ph  <dig> , the antibiotic reduced 90% of colony counts after  <dig> h of incubation . taken together, our results suggest that low ph incubation modifies the outer membrane permeability, allowing the entry of mccj <dig> and novobiocin into the cell.

as a mean of simulating internal macrophage conditions, antibiotic sensitivity assays were carried out in m <dig> medium without nutrient supplementation. however, we considered interesting to evaluate the low ph effect on the sensitivity of s. thypimurium to mccj <dig> and novobiocin when bacteria are cultured in a medium that allows bacterial growth. the s. thypimurium viability upon antibiotic treatment was estimated by calculating cfu ml- <dig> after  <dig> h of incubation in m <dig> medium  supplemented with  <dig> % glucose,  <dig> % casamino acids and  <dig> μm mgso <dig>  in fact, compared with the control , surviving bacteria were  <dig>  and  <dig> % for cultures treated with mccj <dig> and novobiocin, respectively . since bacterial physiology is radically different in actively growing cultures compared with cultures in non-supplemented minimal medium, the observation of the low ph effect in both conditions strengthen the idea that low ph is a determinant feature in turning resistant bacteria to mccj <dig> and novobiocin into sensitive ones.

in summary, these results present evidence that the previously reported resistance of s. thypimurium to mccj <dig> and novobiocin, produced by the inability of the antibiotics to penetrate the bacterial outer membrane  <cit> , could be overcome when cells are exposed to low ph.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present work we demonstrated that mccj <dig> has an inhibitory effect on the intracellular replication of an in vitro mccj25-resistant strain of s. typhimurium. we suggest that the low ph of the macrophage environment is responsible for this effect, possibly by modifying the bacterial outer-membrane permeability.

from our results we can infer that several intracellular pathogenic strains that are naturally resistant to the antibiotic in vitro could be sensitive in vivo and that the action spectrum of mccj <dig> may be broader than what in vitro studies suggested.
