BACKGROUND
gastrodia elata is a rootless and leafless achlorophyllous orchid that grows in a symbiotic relationship with two compatible mycorrhizal fungi, mycena spp. and armillaria mellea, during seed germination and vegetative growth, respectively . the seeds of g. elata are tiny and do not possess an endosperm, and these seeds germinate only when adequate nutrition is obtained through the digestion of the specific fungi, mycena spp., which invades the embryonic cells of these seeds . currently, four fungi species, including mycena anoectochila, m. dendrobii , m. orchidicola, and m. osmundicola, isolated from different species of orchids  <cit> , promote the germination of g. elata seeds to form protocorms and further develop into vegetative propagation corms  . once vegetative propagation corms have been established from seed germination, g. elata undergoes vegetative growth through an established symbiotic association with the compatible mycorrhizal fungi, a. mellea , to yield juvenile tubers   <cit> . the vegetative propagation corms of g. elata obtain nutrition and energy from a. mellea to develop into tubers, and the growth conditions of tubers are positively and closely associated with the hyphal development of this fungi  <cit> . the hyphae of a. mellea develop well in the cortical layers of g. elata tubers  <cit> ; however, the cells in the pith of tubers digest the invaded hyphae to obtain nutrition and energy  <cit> .fig.  <dig> materials in the study. fungus of mycena dendrobii , vegetative propagation corm , armillaria mellea , and juvenile tuber  of gastrodia elata. scale bars = 1 cm



since ancient times, gastrodia elata has been used as a chinese medicine for the cure of various conditions, including for its analgesic, antiepileptic, neuroprotective, anticonvulsant, and sedative effects against vertigo, general paralysis, and tetanus . numerous functional components isolated from g. elata have been characterized, such as gastrodin  and the aglycone gastrodigenin  as a primary active ingredient , and the other related components, including 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillyl alcohol, and vanillin, also show potential anticonvulsant activity . moreover, other constituents in g. elata, including gastrodioside, 4-hydroxybenzyl methyl ether, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, parishin, β-sitosterol, bis  sulfide, n6- adenine riboside, dauricine, citric acid, palmitate, and succinic acid, have been reported .

gastrodin, a simple glycoside comprising glucose and 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol , is the major phenolic compound of g. elata, and pharmacological tests have shown that this compound exhibits tranquilization, anti-inflammation, analgesia, cortical neuron protection, memory improvement, sedative, anticonvulsant, free radical scavenging, neuroprotective effect, anesthetic, and antioxidant effects . gastrodin was identified, characterized, and artificially synthesized at the end of 1970s  <cit> . furthermore, gastrodin biosynthesis markedly increases from the growth stage of vegetative propagation corms to that of juvenile tubers, which have no flower buds  <cit> . in general, gastrodin production is derived from 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol through a one-step glycosylation with different glucose donors. therefore, one of key enzymes of gastrodin biosynthesis is glucosyltransferase, a large family identified in various plants  <cit> . glycosylation is typically the final step in the biosynthesis of secondary plant compounds, resulting in the formation of a large number of glucosides . the glycosylation might increase solubility or decrease volatility compared with non-glycosylated molecules  <cit> . toluenes are general components in plants that serve as the precursors of plant secondary compounds . toluene is considered as a precursor of gastrodin  <cit> . the derivation of the metabolic pathway of 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol derived from toluene is largely unknown in g. elata and other plants. however, the catalytic pathway from toluene to 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol has been reported to involve hydroxylation through monooxygenase of cytochrome p <dig>   <cit> , a member of a large enzyme family in plants that catalyzes most of the oxidation steps in plant secondary metabolism . the molecular basis of gastrodin biosynthesis remains largely unknown. in the present study, the comparative transcriptome analysis among a. mellea, the vegetative propagation corms and juvenile tubers of gastrodia was conducted using deep sequencing to reveal the gene regulation of gastrodin biosynthesis in g. elata.

RESULTS
the transcriptome sequencing of ngs
de novo transcriptome sequencing has been used in various functional genomics studies, and is particularly suitable for gene expression profiling in non-model organisms without genomic sequences. the next generation sequencing  technology not only provides a comparative expressed sequence tag  analysis for gene discovery on a genome-wide scale in non-model plants but also an efficient process for transcriptome sequencing and characterization. ngs platforms, such as the illumina/solexa genome analyzer and the roche  <dig> gs flx, have been widely used in recent years for the high-throughput sequencing of various organisms  <cit> . using these techniques for de novo transcriptome sequencing, est databases have been successfully obtained for several medicinal herbs, including american ginseng  <cit> , salvia miltiorrhiza  <cit> , sweet wormwood  <cit> , euphorbia fischeriana  <cit> , taxus  <cit> , and other crops, such as chili pepper  <cit> , maize  <cit> , curcuma longa  <cit> , chestnut  <cit> , eucalyptus tree  <cit> , olive  <cit> , camellia sinensis  <cit> , sweet potato  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> , and phalaenopsis  <cit> . the illumina platform is beneficial and useful for gene discovery because this technique can obtain deeper coverage and higher accuracy than roche  <dig> sequencing technology  <cit> . hence, the illumina system was used in the present study to clarify the differential gene expression of different life stages of g. elata.

differential expression analysis between a. mellea and juvenile tuber of gastrodia elata
the comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of the a. mellea and g. elata  juvenile tubers was conducted based on the combined transcriptome assembly of all three samples. among the total  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes were aligned with reads from a. mellea and g. elata juvenile tubers, respectively . among these unigenes, only  <dig> unigenes were identified in both samples of deep sequencing data. to evaluate differential gene expression, the absolute value of the log2-fc  ≥  <dig>  the q-values <  <dig>  and the tmm-normalized fpkm >  <dig>  were used as the criteria to determine the significance of gene expression differences  <cit> . a total of  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes were revealed in the transcriptome comparison, of which sixty-nine unigenes were significantly up-regulated  in a. mellea , and  <dig> unigenes in g. elata juvenile tubers were expressed at significantly higher levels   . of  <dig> the differentially expressed unigenes, only  <dig> unigenes can be assigned with kegg ortholog identifiers  or enzyme commission  numbers corresponding to biological pathways for cellular functions and molecular interactions after kegg analysis. among these, twenty-five up-regulated unigenes from a. mellea and g. elata juvenile tuber were assigned koids or ec numbers corresponding to twenty-eight isogroups involved in sixteen different pathways ; and eighty-one down-regulated unigenes were corresponding to  <dig> isogroups involved in sixty different pathways .fig.  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes between a

differential expression analysis between the juvenile tuber and vegetative propagation corm of gastrodia elata
the comparative analysis of transcriptomes of the juvenile tubers  and vegetative propagation corms  was conducted also based on the combined transcriptome assembly of all three samples. among the total  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes were aligned with reads from juvenile tubers and vegetative propagation corms, respectively . among these,  <dig>  unigenes were identified in both samples, and  <dig>  differentially expressed unigenes were revealed in the transcriptome comparison using the same criteria .  <dig> and  <dig>  unigenes were expressed at higher levels in g. elata juvenile tubers and vegetative propagation corms, respectively . to focus on highly and differentially expressed unigenes by modifying the threshold of tmm-normalized fpkm larger than ten,  <dig> highly and differentially expressed unigenes were revealed in the transcriptome comparison. among which  <dig> unigenes were significantly up-regulated  in juvenile tubers , and  <dig> unigenes in vegetative propagation corms were expressed at significantly higher levels   . of  <dig> the differentially expressed genes, only  <dig> unigenes can be assigned to koids or ec numbers corresponding to to biological pathways for cellular functions and molecular interactions after kegg analysis. among these,  <dig> up-regulated  unigenes from juvenile tubers compared with vegetative propagation corms were assigned to koids or ec numbers corresponding to  <dig> isogroups involved in seventy-eight different pathways ; and  <dig> down-regulated  unigenes were assigned to koids or ec numbers corresponding to  <dig> isogroups involved in eighty different pathways .

kusano  first reported that g. elata existed in a mycorrhizal relationship with the wood-rotting pathogen a. mellea; however, this relationship was uncharacterized  <cit> . until  <dig>  zhang and li showed that g. elata digests the invasive hyphae of a. mellea as the source of nutrition  <cit> . lan et al.  also confirmed that a. mellea was used as the source of nutrition for g. elata through the observation of labeled materials from a. mellea in the transverse section of g. elata. the labeled materials appeared in mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum and vacuoles of g. elata cortical cells  <cit> . when the hyphae of a. mellea are disconnected between wood  and g. elata, the growth of g. elata terminates and this organism dies; therefore, the role of a. mellea for g. elata was considered as the food for survival  <cit> . according to the differential gene expression in g. elata in response to a. mellea symbiosis, unigene trinity_dn70668_c0_g <dig> is significantly induced , as high as ~ <dig> folds, and this gene was annotated as a gastrodianin  gene, which digests the cell wall of a. mellea  <cit> . this result suggested that g. elata digests the invasive hyphae of a. mellea as a source of nutrition according to zhang and li   <cit> . in the present study, the low-level gene expression of the gastrodianin biosynthetic gene was detected in vegetative propagation corms , which differentiated from protocorms, suggesting that the symbiotic relationship between a. mellea and g. elata only can be developed during the vegetative propagation corms of g. elata  <cit> . according to previous reports, there are two copies of gastrodianin biosynthetic genes in g. elata  <cit> , and these two genes  were also identified through deep sequencing data in the present study, only unigene trinity_dn70668_c0_g <dig> was significantly induced in the juvenile tubers of g. elata in response to a. mellea symbiosis . the result was consistent with the previous gene expression study of the gastrodianin biosynthetic gene in g. elata  <cit> .

identification and validation of candidate genes involved in gastrodin biosynthesis
the mechanism and related genes in the gastrodin biosynthesis pathway are currently unknown. to the best of our knowledge, gastrodin  is a simple glycoside comprising glucose and 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol  <cit> . the last biosynthesis enzyme of gastrodin is glucosyltransferase  <cit> . gastrodins are synthesized from 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol with udp-glucose via glucosylation catalyzed through glucosyltransferase. the precursor of gastrodin, 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, is catalyzed through cresols degradation  from toluene through two steps of hydroxylation via monooxygenase   <cit> . therefore, both monooxygenase and glucosyltransferase are considered two key enzymes for gastrodin biosynthesis  <cit> . according to the chemical structure of gastrodin and gastrodin precursors, analyzed in previous reports, the putative gastrodin biosynthetic pathway is shown in fig.  <dig>  however, both monooxygenase  and glucosyltransferase belong to a large enzyme families involved in different biosynthesis pathways in various plants  <cit> . moreover, 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol and gastrodin were also detected in anoectochilus formosanus  <cit> . to determine the candidate genes involved in gastrodin biosynthesis, the comparative analysis of the transcriptomes between vegetative propagation corm and juvenile tuber of g. elata was conducted. a total of thirty and forty-six unigenes, respectively, were annotated to monooxygenase and glucosyltransferase among the  <dig>  unigenes expressed both in the juvenile tubers and the vegetative propagation corms of g. elata. under the criteria of log2-fc ≥  <dig>  tmm-normalized fpkm >  <dig> and q-values <  <dig> , four putative monooxygenases were selected. among them, unigene trinity_dn54282_c0_g <dig> was the most abundance in fpkms and differentially expressed one . under the same criteria, three putative glucosyltransferases were selected and the unigene trinity_dn50323_c0_g <dig> was the highest differentially expressed one .fig.  <dig> putative gastrodin biosynthetic pathway in gastrodia elata




to validate the differential expression of gastrodin biosynthesis-related unigenes trinity_dn54282_c0_g <dig> and trinity_dn50323_c0_g <dig>  we investigated the expression of these genes in different life stages between the vegetative propagation corms and juvenile tubers of g. elata using semi-quantitative rt-pcr and real-time pcr , and compared the results with fold-changes of fpkm . the specific primers for semi-quantitative rt-pcr and qrt-pcr were designed. in semi-quantitative rt-pcr, expression profiling revealed the differential expression of both monooxygenases and glycosyltransferases between the vegetative propagation corms and juvenile tubers of gastrodia elata . both monooxygenases and glycosyltransferase genes were up-regulated in the juvenile tubers and were considered as gastrodin biosynthetic-related genes, as gastrodin production markedly increases from the growth stage of vegetative propagation corms to that of juvenile tubers  <cit> . in addition, the differential expression of the two genes was also validated through qrt-pcr analysis as shown in fig.  <dig>  the expression levels of the unigene trinity_dn54282_c0_g <dig> were up-regulated up to  <dig>  times in juvenile tubers and  <dig>  times for qrt-pcr and rna-seq, respectively. similarly, qrt-pcr and rna-seq showed that the expression levels for unigene trinity_dn50323_c0_g <dig> were up-regulated approximately  <dig>  and  <dig>  times, respectively, in juvenile tubers. the results of both semi-quantitative rt-pcr  and qrt-pcr analysis  were consistent with the rna-seq data.fig.  <dig> semi-quantitative rt-pcr profile of gasstrodin related candidate genes unigene trinity_dn54282_c0_g <dig>  and trinity_dn50323_c0_g <dig>  in different life stage of vegetative propagation corm  and juvenile tuber  of gastrodia elata tissues with ubiquitin as the internal control. rt+ and rt- represent amplifications with and without reverse transcriptase

monooxygenases belong to cytochrome p <dig> proteins, the largest family of plant proteins, which catalyze most of the oxidation steps in plant secondary metabolism  <cit> . the comparison of the chemical structures of 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol and the precursor toluene , revealed two steps catalyzed through monooxygenase, the conversion of toluene to 4-hydroxytoluene and the conversion of 4-hydroxytoluene to 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol. therefore, unigene trinity_dn54282_c0_g <dig>  was considered as a toluene monooxygenase gene, consistent with the kegg pathway annotation . generally, glycosylation is the last step in the biological biosynthesis of secondary metabolism because sugar conjunction results in both the increased water solubility and stability of the compounds . in g. elata, glycosyltransferase catalyzes the last step of the gastrodin biosynthesis pathway, which converts 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol to gastrodin  <cit>  . therefore, unigene trinity_dn50323_c0_g <dig>  was considered as a glycosyltransferase gene, consistent with the kegg pathway annotation . in short, both unigenes trinity_dn54282_c0_g <dig> and trinity_dn50323_c0_g <dig> might be key enzyme genes that, respectively, participate in the hydroxylation  and glucosylation  of gastrodin .fig.  <dig> hydroxylation by monooxygenase  in toluene degradation. the putative enzymes are in red

cloning of gastrodin biosynthesis related genes
the full-length cdna sequences of monooxygenases  and glycosyltransferases  from g. elata were further isolated through race analysis. the nucleotide sequence of the full-length monooxygenase cdna has an open reading frame  of  <dig> nucleotides spanning from the first initiation codon  to the termination codon , an in-frame stop codon located 12 nt upstream from the initiation codon and an out-of-frame atg located upstream of the main orf. the complete orf encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  kda . in addition, the nucleotide sequence of the full-length glucosyltransferase cdna has an orf of  <dig> nucleotides spanning from the first initiation codon atg to the termination codon tga, an in-frame stop codon located 12 nt upstream from the initiation codon and an out-of-frame atg located upstream of the main orf. the complete orf encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a predicted protein of  <dig>  kda .fig.  <dig>

notably, both monooxygenases  and glycosyltransferases  induced in response to fungi symbiosis possess an out-of-frame upstream atg and an in-frame stop codon in the main orf within the 5’utr. in mammals, upstream atgs/upstream orfs significantly reduce protein expression levels through a reduction of the translation efficiency  <cit>  or mrna decay . upstream augs/upstream orfs in the 5′ utr efficiently disrupt the translation of the downstream coding sequence, thereby reducing the translation efficiency of the main coding region  <cit> . according to deep sequencing, semi-quantitative rt-pcr, and real-time rt-pcr, both monooxygenases  and glycosyltransferase  genes were co-expressed in vegetative propagation corms. therefore, the upstream atgs of these two genes might result in the low concentration of gastrodin in vegetative propagation corms. the induction of gene expression in response to fungi symbiosis might increase the translation efficiency or mrna stability of the two key enzymes to increase gastrodin production in juvenile tubers. in response to stress, the translation repression of upstream atgs/upstream orfs could be significantly reduced  or mrna stability could be increased  <cit> . in response to fungi invasion, the repression reduction of the translation efficiency of both monooxygenases  and glycosyltransferase  genes in g. elata might also increase the accumulation of gastrodin in juvenile tubers, as fungal infection could be a biotic stress to g. elata.

CONCLUSIONS
the molecular basis of gastrodin biosynthesis in g. elata was clarified based on de novo transcriptome sequencing in the present study. two putative monooxygenase  and glycosyltransferase  genes associated with the gastrodin biosynthesis pathway were identified. the genes of the two key enzymes involved in gastrodin biosynthesis might be applied as the target genes for plant gene transformation in future studies to obtain transgenic plants or microbial hosts with gastrodin production. moreover, this transcriptome dataset also provides important information to accelerate future gene expression and functional genomics studies in g. elata.
