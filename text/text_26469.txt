BACKGROUND
traumatic brain injury  results in immediate irreversible primary brain tissue damage and secondary delayed loss of neurons and glia in the penumbra surrounding the injury site leading to progressive emotional, cognitive and behavioral impairment  <cit> . prevention of the secondary brain injury represents the main target of tbi therapy. excessive release of glutamate following tbi and subsequent intracellular calcium  overload significantly contributes to second brain injury, including brain edema, cerebral ischemia, energy failure, mitochondrial dysfunction, abnormal oxidative phosphorylation, and neuronal death  <cit> . notably, glutamate accumulation inhibits cystine uptake and leads to depletion of gsh, a crucial constituent of the anti-oxidative system  <cit> . elevated intracellular ca2+ makes neurons more dependent on cystine uptake for gsh synthesis, thus exacerbates the imbalanced redox status. neuronal degeneration following excess glutamate exposure also has been attributed to oxidative damage generated in mitochondria  <cit> . mitochondrial dysfunction induced by tbi causes overproduction of reactive oxygen species, depletion of adenosine triphosphate, and more importantly, leakage of cytochrome c, which is a key mediator in prompting caspase-dependent cell apoptosis  <cit> . as a result, inhibition of glutamate release following tbi is likely to attenuate oxidative stress and delayed cell death.

n-acetylaspartylglutamate  is one of the most abundant transmitters in the mammalian nervous system  <cit> , and serves as a potent agonist at the type  <dig> metabotropic glutamate receptor  . activating mglur <dig> by naag reduces the synaptic glutamate release . furthermore, elevated concentration of naag promotes glutamate uptake in astrocytes as a consequence of mglur <dig> activation  <cit> . inhibition of glutamate carboxypeptidase ii  increased naag and reduced glutamate, aspartate, and gaba levels in a fluid percussion injury rat model  <cit> . in the same tbi model system, naag peptidase inhibition, reduced acute neuronal degeneration and astrocyte damage in the ca2/ <dig> regions of the hippocampus  <cit> .

these data suggest that inhibition of gcpii is a potentially significant therapeutic strategy for reducing glutamate induced secondary neurodegeneration following traumatic brain injury. however, the cellular mechanisms underlying this neuroprotection have not been established. in the present study, a gcpii knockout  mouse strain has been used to assess the potential role of oxidative stress related pathways in the neuroprotective activity of naag. we previously reported that these gcpii ko mice develop normally and exhibit less neurodegeneration and astrocyte damage following tbi  <cit> .

methods
animals
male gcpii ko mice and their littermates  in ages 8–12 weeks, weighing 25–28 g were used in this study. genotypes of ko mice and their wild-type  littermates were confirmed by pcr amplification as described in a previous study  <cit> . animals were free access to food and water and housed under a 12-h light/dark cycle in a constant temperature  and humidity  environment.

production of tbi
a controlled cortical impact  device  was used to induce tbi as described previously  <cit> . mice were anesthetized  and fixed in a stereotaxic frame. the core body temperature was monitored by a rectal probe and maintained at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  °c using a heating pad. a 5-mm diameter craniotomy centered at  <dig>  mm posterior to bregma and  <dig>  mm lateral to the midline over the right parietal cortex was performed, and injury to dura was avoided. injury was induced by a  <dig>  mm rounded metal tip that was angled to have a vertical direction to the brain surface. the metal tip compressed the brain at a speed of  <dig>  m/s with a deformation depth of  <dig>  mm below the dura. apart from cci injury, the sham group mice underwent the identical procedure as injured mice.

tissue collecting and sectioning
animals  were euthanized with sodium pentobarbital  at 24 h post-injury, and transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline  followed by 50 ml of 4 % paraformaldehyde . the intact brains were post-fixed in 4 % pfa at 4 °c overnight and then transferred to pbs containing 30 % sucrose for cytoprotection. consecutive coronal sections of 5 μm thickness were cut at 200 μm intervals in a vibratome . every section starting at approximately bregma-1 mm and ending at bregma- <dig>  mm was collected in 24-well cell culture plate for staining. a total number of twelve sections in each brain were collected for terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dutp nick 30′-end labeling  staining.

tunel staining and quantification
tunel staining data were obtained using a commercial kit . briefly, sections were incubated in tunel reaction mixture containing terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase  for 60 min at 37 °c. the slides were then washed in pbs for three times, counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  for 2 min, and rinsed with pbs. the sections were analyzed under a fluorescent microscope . a cell was considered as apoptotic only if its nucleus was stained with both fluorescein and dapi. six randomly selected non-overlapped vision fields  surrounding the primary contused area in each section  were chosen, and the mean number of tunel-positive nuclei/dapi-stained nuclei in the six views was regarded as the apoptotic index of each section. the final average percentage of tunel-positive cells of the twelve sections was regarded as the data for each animal.

measurement of glutathione , malondialdehyde  levels, and superoxide dismutase  and glutathione peroxidase  activities
to detect oxidative damage and evaluate the neuroprotective ability of gcp ii ko against tbi-induced oxidative injury, the entire ipsilateral cortex  was collected 24 h following tbi for analysis of the brain concentration of mda and gsh and the activity of gpx and sod using commercially available assay kits .

protein extraction and western blot analysis
mice were sacrificed and decapitated 1 day after cci, and the brains  were quickly removed. a 5-mm punch of the ipsilateral cortex including 3 mm primary impacted tissue and 2 mm penumbra tissue in each brain was obtained for western blot analysis . protein extraction of both cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions was performed as previously described  <cit> . samples were homogenized in prechilled extraction buffer  with a protease inhibitor and dtt, and then sedimented at 700 g for 10 min at 4 °c. the supernatant was further sedimented at  <dig>  g for 30 min at 4 °c. supernatant of  <dig>  g was collected as cytosolic fraction while the pellet was resuspended with mitochondrial extraction buffer mix and saved as mitochondrial fraction. protein concentrations were determined using the pierce bca kit. equal amounts  of proteins were separated by 12 % sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride  membranes. the membranes were blocked with 5 % skimmed milk in pbs containing  <dig>  % tween  <dig>  for 2 h at room temperature and then probed with primary antibodies at 4 °c overnight on a shaking platform. the primary rabbit-anti-mouse antibodies, including cleaved caspase- <dig>  cytochrome c, bcl- <dig>  bax, β-actin, and vdac were 1: <dig> dilutions purchased from cell signaling technology, danvers, ma, usa. the membranes were washed by pbst and incubated with goat anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody  at 4 °c for  <dig>  h. the relative intensity of protein signals was normalized to the corresponding β-actin or vdac intensity and was analyzed by image j software.

statistical analysis
all data were presented as mean ± standard error of the mean . data were analyzed by one-way anova and post hoc bonferroni t test. statistical difference was set at p <  <dig> .

cleaved caspase- <dig> levels, a crucial apoptotic executor, were robustly upregulated in both groups after tbi , consistent with the result of tunel-staining. the gcpii ko group had significantly lower levels of cleaved caspase- <dig> compared to their wt counterparts .

discussion
our previous study found that this strain of gcpii ko mice developed normally with no apparent differences compared with wt mice in terms of survival and standard neurological tests, but had lessened neuronal degeneration and astrocyte damage after tbi  <cit> . data from the present study also indicate that the gcpii ko mice are less sensitive to tbi in terms of apoptosis in the penumbra around the impact site and additionally support the hypothesis that this protection is mediated by limiting oxidative stress.

it has long been recognized that head trauma induces an excessive release of glutamate and prolonged activation of ca2+ ion channels  <cit> . previous reports have demonstrated a close relationship between glutamate excitotoxicity and oxidative damage . high levels of glutamate release and increased ca2+ influx induces generation of reactive oxygen species and inhibition of gsh synthesis. free radicals interact with unsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes to generate mda, which serves as an index of lipid peroxidation  <cit> . under normal conditions, the low levels of superoxide free radicals are scavenged by enzymatic or non-enzymatic antioxidants. however, a consequence of the overproduction of free radicals is depletion of gsh and reduction in the activity of cat, gpx, and sod, resulting in cellular redox disequilibrium. these observations support the proposal that reducing glutamate release helps to attenuate intracellular ca2+ overload and oxidative stress.

previous studies have reported that inhibition of gcpii exerts an endogenous protective role via increasing extracellular levels of naag, which selectively activates the mglur <dig> and subsequently prevents further pre-synaptic glutamate release. for example, pretreatment with zj- <dig>  an naag peptidase inhibitor, reduces the levels of glutamate, aspartate, and gaba following tbi, and protects neurons and astrocytes from undergoing neurodegenerative changes  <cit> . however, the exact cellular mechanism by which gcpii inhibition is protective against tbi has not been fully elucidated. in the current study, we focused on evaluating the injury-induced oxidative response using a gcpii ko model. in agreement with the theory that inhibiting glutamate exposure helps with gsh synthesis  <cit> , the brain concentration of gsh in the ko mice was significantly higher than that of the wt mice following traumatic impact. furthermore, the level of mda was significantly reduced, and the activities of sod and gpx were evidently enhanced due to gcpii ko. these data supports the hypothesis that the neuroprotective effects of gcpii ko can be attributed, at least in part, to limiting oxidative stress.

mitochondria are important target organelles in the oxidative stress pathway and in affecting cell survival  <cit> . the imbalance of mitochondrial bcl- <dig> and bax leads to an increased release of mitochondrial intermembrane space  proteins, such as cytochrome c, smac/diablo, and apoptosis inducing factors   <cit> . those ims proteins aid in the activation of caspase- <dig> and triggers apoptosis  <cit> . in the present study, we observed decreased bcl-2/bax ratio, as well as increased cytochrome c leakage and cleaved caspase- <dig> expression in the tissues surrounding the primary injury. these data were consistent with the results of previous studies  <cit> . importantly, loss of gcpii reduced the number of tunel-positive neuclei and alleviated the alterations of these apoptosis-related proteins in the penumbra surrounding the primary impact area. these results support the hypothesis that gcpii ko better preserved the mitochondrial function and integrity, an action that likely contributes to decreased neurodegeneration following traumatic brain injury.

in addition to down-regulating presynaptic glutamate release, another possible neuroprotective mechanism of gcp ii ko is also worth noting. recent in vitro studies have shown that activating mglur <dig> helps with recovering the endogenous gsh level  <cit> , reducing ros generation, increasing free radical scavenge and stabilizing mitochondrial function  <cit> . the exact mechanism by which mglur <dig> regulates glial cell survival remains to be elucidated, but stimulation of map/erk kinase and pi3 k/akt signaling pathway may underlie protective effects of mglur <dig> activation in these cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the current study confirmed that gcp ii ko is neuroprotective against tbi induced oxidative damage and cell apoptosis and that effects correlate with the preservation of mitochondrial integrity. further research will be required to determine the relationship among extracellular glutamate and naag levels and intracellular calcium in the gcp ii ko mice after tbi in order to better prove that gcpii ko exerts its neuroprotective effects through the action of naag.
