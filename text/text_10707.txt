BACKGROUND
mature blood cells arise in bone marrow from a small population of haematopoietic stem cells during the haematopoietic process. haematopoietic stem cells give rise to erythroid/myeloid and lymphoid precursors which then continuously proliferate and differentiate to adult blood cells  <cit> . biological functions of haematopoietic cells are tightly regulated with multiple growth factors and cytokines, and by interactions with other cells in bone marrow compartment. these factors determine the rate of haematopoietic cells renewal, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. a failure to respond to external stimuli regulating these processes within bone marrow micro-environment may lead to haematological disorders  <cit> .

the serpins  form a protein superfamily, with members identified in all organisms  <cit> . although designated as protease inhibitors, serpins have also other functions that are not related to their inhibitory activity. all serpins have a common tertiary structure with a dominant β-sheet a supporting a mobile reactive centre loop   <cit> . the p1-p1' peptide bond in the rcl acts as a bait for target proteases. serpins inhibit their target proteases by a mechanism that involves cleavage of the rcl and its insertion into β-sheet a, with simultaneous translocation of the covalently-bound protease to the opposite pole of the serpin molecule  <cit> . the serpins that have been studied most extensively are extracellular proteins. they control proteases in various patho-physiological processes, including inflammation, coagulation, and angiogenesis  <cit> .

the human genome encodes  <dig> serpins, which are grouped into nine clades . the clade b includes  <dig> intracellular serpins  <cit> . some of them are cross-class inhibitors, inhibiting both serine and cysteine proteases  <cit> . eight of them have a unique inter-helical loop, the so-called cd-loop  <cit> , which is an important functional domain of the serpins  <cit> . although the clade b serpins are thought to regulate apoptosis or cell differentiation, their targets remain mostly unknown.

bomapin  belongs to the clade b of human serpins. it is expressed only in bone marrow, leukocytes of patients with myeloid leukaemia that correspond to myeloid progenitors  <cit> , and promyelocytic leukaemia cell lines , but it is not present in terminally differentiated leukocytes  <cit> . this protein has a  <dig> amino acid-long cd-loop that contains a nuclear localization signal  <cit> . bomapin is assumed to have p1-arg at its reactive centre which is consistent with in vitro inhibition of thrombin and trypsin  <cit> . bomapin complex with a possible intracellular protease was detected in hela cells over-expressing the serpin, but the protease was not identified  <cit> . it was proposed that bomapin possibly regulates a protease in the early stages of hematopoietic differentiation  <cit> . however, the roles of bomapin and its intracellular partners still remain unknown.

the main focus of the present studies is to determine the biological role of the haematopoietic-specific bomapin. we show that naturally expressed human bomapin is located in the nucleus, where it exists in an oxidized form with a single disulfide bond. we show also that bomapin has the capacity to influence the fate of myeloid progenitors/leukaemia cells by enhancing their proliferation under optimal growth conditions, or by sensitizing them to apoptosis when the growth conditions are improper. this function of bomapin may be of particular importance because a tight regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, and balance between the two processes, are critical for normal haematopoietic process and for preventing haematological diseases.

RESULTS
bomapin has reactive cysteines that form intramolecular disulfide bond
bomapin was expressed in a thioredoxin reductase deficient e. coli strain, and purified by sequential metal-affinity and ion-exchange chromatography. from the ion-exchange column, bomapin eluted in two partially overlapping peaks; the first peak contained bomapin monomer, whereas the second peak contained mainly bomapin dimer  and small amount of higher order oligomers . interestingly, the purified monomeric bomapin migrated on non-reducing sds-page as a strong 40-kda band, and as a weak 45-kda band . however, only the 45-kda band was present under reducing conditions . this difference in electrophoretic mobility suggests that the only two bomapin cysteines, c <dig>  and c <dig> , form an intramolecular disulfide bond. the oxidized and reduced monomeric forms of bomapin, as well as oligomeric species of the protein, were active as inhibitors since they formed an sds-stable complex with trypsin . as shown by an indirect chromogenic assay, bomapin was able to inhibit about 90% of trypsin activity at bomapin/trypsin  <dig>  molar ratio, and at  <dig>  ratio all trypsin was inhibited . this data suggest that bomapin forms 1: <dig> complex with trypsin, and support the general model for 1: <dig> complex formation between serpin and protease  <cit> .

immunostaining of bomapin in thp <dig> cells  and hl- <dig> cells  revealed that naturally expressed bomapin is mainly localized in the nucleus. since nuclear proteins can be stabilized by disulfide bonds  <cit> , the redox status of the nuclear bomapin became of particular interest. thus, bomapin was immunoprecipitated from hl <dig> cells and analyzed by 7% sds-page followed by western blot. the electrophoretic migration of the naturally expressed bomapin  resembled that of the recombinant protein, suggesting that majority of natural bomapin exists in the oxidized form which contains the intramolecular c68-c <dig> disulfide bond. in contrast to e. coli-expressed bomapin, we have not detected disulfide-linked dimers for the naturally-expressed bomapin.

to provide a structural reference for the redox forms of bomapin, models of the reduced and oxidized forms of bomapin were constructed using homology modelling and simulated annealing calculations . in the model of reduced bomapin, cysteines c <dig> and c <dig> are separated by a distance of about  <dig> Å, they are surface-exposed and likely to take part in redox reactions. the entire cd-loop  is located on the side of the bomapin molecule. secondary structure predictions using apssp <dig> server http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/apssp2/ predicts random coils structure from asn  <dig> to glu  <dig> and between leu  <dig> to ser  <dig>  and a helical tendency between ser  <dig> and asn  <dig>  thus, the cd-loop can be predicted to be flexible, and it can therefore easily be translocated so that the c68-c <dig> disulfide bond can be introduced without apparent perturbation of the overall structure of bomapin.

wild-type bomapin promotes proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells
to investigate the role of bomapin, we stably transfected k <dig> cells with bomapin-egfp fusion or egfp alone. as shown in figure 2a, bomapin-egfp was localized in the nucleus whereas the control egfp was distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. the expression level of bomapin-egfp in k <dig> cells, measured by bomapin-specific elisa, was similar to that of native bomapin in thp- <dig>  u <dig> and hl- <dig> cells .

exponentially growing cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail, and bomapin level was quantified by bomapin-specific elisa .

proliferation of the bomapin-egfp and egfp expressing cells was assayed by manual counting, and by using cell proliferation reagent wst <dig>  as shown in figure 2b, bomapin-egfp cells had about 90% higher cell density at  <dig> h of incubation than those expressing egfp. proliferation of wild-type  k <dig> cells, although slightly higher than for egfp cells, was still significantly lower than for bomapin-egfp cells. bomapin-egfp cells metabolized the wst <dig> reagent faster than the egfp cells . finally, the nuclei of bomapin-egfp cells were about 50% larger than the nuclei of egfp cells . doubling time during the linear phase of cell growth was shorter for bomapin-egfp cells  than for egfp cells  and wt k <dig> cells . however, as shown by dna-flow cytometry analyses, the cell distribution in the g0/g <dig>  s, and g2/m phases for bomapin-egfp cells  was similar to that for egfp cells , suggesting that bomapin had no effect on distribution of cells during the cell cycle. in addition, the difference in percentage of trypan blue-positive cells for exponentially growing bomapin-egfp cells  and the control egfp cells  was not statistically significant, suggesting that the increased proliferation of bomapin-egfp cells can not be explain by a lower apoptosis rate.

to show that native bomapin also has en effect on cell proliferation, we incubated u <dig> cells with bomapin-specific antisense  or sense  dna oligonucleotides. proliferation of all oligonucleotide-treated cells was lower than proliferation of untreated u <dig> cells, which can possibly result from the known slightly toxic effect of the nucleotides on cells. nevertheless, the antisense-treated cells had decreased bomapin levels , and had about 40% lower cell proliferation , compared to the cells incubated with the sense oligonucleotide. in addition, u <dig> cells incubated with bas <dig> metabolized less wst- <dig> reagent than the control u <dig> cells incubated with bs .

to find out whether bomapin can influence proliferation of other cells, not only myeloid progenitors, we expressed bomapin in ht- <dig> cells. in these cells, bomapin-egfp was also located in the nucleus , and was expressed to a similar level as it was in leukaemia cells , but it had no effect on cell proliferation .

bomapin mutant lacking disulfide bond has no effect on cell proliferation
as majority of natural bomapin was found in the conformation where the cd-loop was linked to c-terminal part of the protein via a disulfide bond, it was of interest whether the oxidized form of bomapin is important for the observed bomapin effect on cell proliferation. therefore, we created a single-cysteine bomapin mutant  lacking the disulfide bond, which represents the reduced form of bomapin. expressed in e. coli, this mutant was active as inhibitor and formed an sds-stable complex with trypsin . the c395s-bomapin-egfp fusion expressed in k <dig> cells had nuclear localization , as it was shown for wt bomapin . expression level of the c395s mutant in k <dig> cells was also similar to the wild type bomapin . however, proliferation of the cells that were expressing the c395s-bomapin-egfp mutant was identical to that of the control cells expressing egfp . this strongly suggests that it is the oxidized form of bomapin that is important for the enhancement of cell proliferation.

bomapin enhances cell apoptosis following withdrawal of growth factors
haematopoietic progenitors deprived of growth factors undergo mitogenic arrest that is followed by apoptosis  <cit> . therefore, we tested whether the haematopoietic-specific bomapin has an effect on cell apoptosis. for this purpose, we incubated k <dig> cells expressing bomapin-egfp, wt k <dig> cells, and k <dig> cells expressing egfp, under normal growth conditions or in the absence of serum. at different time points of the starvation, dead cells were labelled with trypan blue and counted under microscope. as shown in figure 4a, the amount of dead cells was about 65-70% higher for bomapin-egfp cells, than for the parental k <dig> cells and egfp cells. the cells were also stained with annexin v-pe-cys <dig> and then apoptotic cells showing purple fluorescence on cell membrane were counted under microscope . again, there was about 100% more apoptotic cells in the cells expressing bomapin-egfp than in the control cells. the analysis of cell cycle phases of egfp-expressing k <dig> cells cultured without serum showed a progressive increase of cell population in g2/m-phase with a concomitant decrease of cell population in s-phase, compared to the cell distribution under normal growth conditions. under the same conditions, bomapin-egfp expression resulted in accumulation of cells in s-phase, while the cell number in g2/m-phase remained constant .

apoptosis is characterized by cleavage of several intracellular proteins. therefore, the cell extracts from egfp- and bomapin-egfp-expressing cells were analyzed for two apoptotic markers: lamins-a/c and parp. there was no, or very little, degradation of lamins-a/c and cleavage of parp in all the cells under normal growth condition . however, bomapin-egfp cells revealed more pronounced degradation of lamins-a/c and higher cleavage of parp following serum starvation, than the control wt k <dig> and egfp-expressing cells . the data indicate that bomapin expression facilitates apoptosis of k <dig> cells following withdrawal of growth factors.

discussion
haematopoiesis is the best studied stem cell differentiation process, where hematopoietic progenitors self-renew and differentiate into blood cells, or undergo apoptosis. any failure to respond to stimuli regulating these processes may lead to leukaemia. many transcription factors that regulate the haematopoietic processes have been described. however, the downstream pathways, including regulation of various factors by proteases - and control of the latter by specific inhibitors - are less well defined. in this study, we have used leukaemia cells as a model of myeloid progenitor cells. we have shown that the haematopoietic-specific bomapin  is a nuclear, redox-sensitive protein that enhances proliferation of myeloid leukaemia cells under normal growth conditions, and enhances apoptosis of the cells following growth factors withdrawal.

bomapin has two cysteines: c <dig> which is located in the long cd-loop, and c <dig> located close to the c-terminus. molecular modelling of bomapin suggests that these cysteines in the reduced form of bomapin are distant, solvent-exposed and predicted to be highly reactive. due to a high potential flexibility/mobility of the cd-loop, the cysteines can be disulfide-linked to form intramolecular disulfide bond without major perturbations of the bomapin structure . the high reactivity of both cysteines is supported by the fact that bomapin expressed in e. coli was present in the form of oxidized monomer , and disulfide-linked dimers . sds-page analysis of immunoprecipitated naturally expressed bomapin showed that majority of the protein existed in the oxidized monomeric form with intramolecular disulfide bond . there is a theoretical possibility that bomapin was artificially oxidized during immunoprecipitation and sds-page, however, the fact that disulfide-linked conformation of bomapin is important for an enhanced cell proliferation  strongly suggests that the oxidized monomers of bomapin existed already in intact cells. in contrast to the bacterial-expressed bomapin, we have not observed any oligomeric species for the naturally expressed bomapin in leukaemia cells. this could be due to low bomapin levels  and crowding effect in nucleus, or known differences in redox environment between nucleus of human cells and bacterial cytoplasm.

although it is generally known that cytosolic compartment of eukaryotic cells has a high reducing potential which prevents the formation of stable disulfide bonds in proteins, relatively less is known about redox potential of nuclear compartment. however, several reports show that nuclear proteins may exist in oxidized forms with disulfide bonds of functional importance. for example, lamins-a/c, which are structural proteins of nuclear envelope, have to be in the form of disulfide-stabilized dimer to be able to bind chromatin dna  <cit> ; formation of a single intramolecular disulfide bond in transcription factor yap <dig> is responsible for redistribution of the protein into nucleus  <cit> ; disulfide-linked form of clusterin is known to accumulate in nuclei of early apoptotic epithelial cells  <cit> . therefore, the existence of a disulfide bond in naturally expressed bomapin is consistent with its nuclear localization . the disulfide bond also appears to be essential for the function of bomapin since only wt/oxidized bomapin, but not the c395s mutant, was capable of enhancing proliferation of k <dig> cells . these data suggest that the oxidised conformation of bomapin is important for an interaction of the serpin with another nuclear protein, and that bomapin effect on cell proliferation might be dependent only on the redox status of bomapin. however, with the current knowledge, we can not exclude a scenario where bomapin inhibitory activity is also involved, but it becomes essential only after the oxidized bomapin binds to its nuclear partner. bomapin is a second, after its closest homologue plasminogen activator inhibitor type  <dig> , redox-dependent intracellular serpin. for pai- <dig>  the formation of a single disulfide bond between cysteines located in the cd-loop and at the bottom of the serpin molecule, induces conformational changes which result in spontaneous non-covalent polymerization of the serpin  <cit> , but biological function of the conformational switch is unknown.

to study intracellular function of bomapin, we took advantage of the fact that the human k <dig> cells do not express bomapin naturally , and stably transfected the cells with bomapin-egfp fusion, or egfp as a control. consistent with previous studies on hela cells over-expressing gfp-bomapin  <cit> , the bomapin-egfp fusion in k <dig> cells had a dominant nuclear distribution . expression of bomapin-egfp in k <dig> cells resulted in about 90% higher cell proliferation , and a significant shortening of the cell cycle without changes in distribution of cells in different phases of cell cycle. bomapin-egfp expressing cells had also bigger nuclei than the control cells . on the other hand, down regulation of bomapin expression in u <dig> cells by means of antisense oligonucleotides resulted in a decreased cell proliferation , suggesting that the bomapin effect on cell proliferation was not specific for the k <dig> cells only. however, the effect of bomapin on cell proliferation was leukaemia/haematopoietic-specific because expression of bomapin-egfp in the human fibrosarcoma ht <dig> cells did not change proliferation of the cells . this strongly suggests that bomapin needs a haematopoietic-specific partner protein to enhance cell proliferation. two other serpins from clade b have been reported to influence cell proliferation. the first one is rat trespin which is believed to be a homolog of human bomapin, but it is expressed in various tissues whereas bomapin is bone marrow-specific  <cit> ; over-expression of trespin in human embryonic kidney epithelial cell line  resulted in an increased proliferation of the cells  <cit> . the second one is kidney-specific mouse megsin which is responsible for increased proliferation of messangial cells in megsin-transgenic mice  <cit> . the mechanism behind serpin-dependent enhancement of cell proliferation remains yet unknown.

bone marrow haematopoietic progenitors, quiescent without stimulation, can be activated to proliferate and to differentiate by cytokines and growth factors. when growth factor levels decrease, the cells undergo mitotic arrest followed by apoptosis that leads to termination of cell expansion  <cit> . in contrast, leukemic cells cultured in the absence of growth factors can continue to proliferate and evade apoptosis for a long time. in the case of k <dig> cells, the aberrant bcr/abl fusion kinase activates both proliferation and anti-apoptotic signals that are responsible for relatively high proliferation rate of these cells, and their resistance to apoptosis  <cit> . however, bomapin-egfp expressing k <dig> cells cultured without serum showed an increased cell accumulation in s-phase and increased apoptosis, compared to the control cells expressing egfp . therefore, bomapin antagonise the anti-apoptotic properties of bcr/abl fusion and sensitizes k <dig> cells to apoptosis when growth factors are absent.

CONCLUSIONS
hematopoiesis requires a tight balance between proliferation and apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitors. this balance is controlled by many factors, including cytokines and growth factors. although precise signalling pathways and downstream effectors balancing proliferation and apoptosis are not fully known, they may involve akt, e2f1/rb protein, and/or myc signalling pathways  <cit> . these signalling pathways respond to growth factor levels by inducing cell proliferation or cell apoptosis. here we show that bomapin, a nuclear and redox-sensitive protein, can stimulate proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells under normal growth condition, and can increase apoptosis of the cells following the growth factors removal. we therefore propose that bomapin is involved in a pathway that sensitizes myeloid progenitor cells to growth environment. since proper regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis is essential for normal hematopoiesis and for prevention of leukemic transformation, the function of bomapin described here may be of considerable importance.
