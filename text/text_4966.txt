BACKGROUND
the large yellow croaker  is an economically important marine fish in china, with an annual yield that exceeds any other single netcage-farmed marine species. however, recent rapid development of the large yellow croaker farming industry has led to increasingly severe outbreaks of infectious disease caused by marine bacteria such as aeromonas hydrophila , resulting in great economic losses  <cit> . however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the immune response to such pathogenic bacteria in this fish species, thereby hindering the establishment of effective measures in disease control  <cit> .

cellular identity and function are determined by the transcriptome or the complete repertoire of expressed rna transcripts. transcriptome profiling is a powerful method for assessing the relative importance of gene products in any chosen cell, tissue, organism, or condition. during the last few years, several methods have been used to study the fish transcriptome, including ests in channel catfish  <cit> , atlantic salmon  <cit> , and orange-spotted grouper  <cit> , as well as microarrays in adult zebrafish  <cit> , rainbow trout  <cit> , blue catfish  <cit> , medaka, and xiphophorus maculates  <cit> . however, microarrays are limited by background and cross-hybridization problems and only measure the relative abundance of transcripts. moreover, only predefined sequences are detected  <cit> . est sequencing techniques have limitations in the depth of the transcriptome that can be sampled  <cit> .

recent rapid developments of high-throughput deep sequencing technologies have provided an unprecedented increase in transcriptome data  <cit> . these next-generation sequencing platforms, such as the solexa/illumina genome analyzer and abi/solid gene sequencer, can sequence in parallel massive amounts of dna molecules derived directly from mrna, producing millions or even billions of high-quality short reads  <cit> . deepsage is a tag sequencing method on the illumina high-throughput sequencing platform that is analogous to longsage  <cit> . compared to longsage, deepsage provides much more sensitive and cost-efficient gene expression profiling  <cit> . by using this technology, some progress has recently been made in the characterization of the immune mechanisms and pathways in zebrafish  <cit> . nevertheless, there are still important gaps in the knowledge of numerous immune mechanisms, and the available information varies according to the fish species  <cit> .

here, the large yellow croaker was used as a model to investigate the host response to a. hydrophila infection. first, a transcriptome library was constructed from spleen isolated from a. hydrophila-infected fish. deep sequencing was accomplished using the solexa/illumina sequencing technology. using the soap de novo transcriptome assembly software, we ultimately obtained a transcriptome database containing  <dig> identified unigenes. quantitative gene expression analysis was performed using deepsage technology. tags identified from normal and bacteria-infected fish were mapped to the transcriptome database above for comparative analysis. a reference set of significantly upregulated and downregulated immune-related genes was compiled.

RESULTS
transcriptome profile of the large yellow croaker 
to better understand the molecular mechanisms of the large yellow croaker immune system, we constructed a solexa cdna library from the spleen of fish infected with a. hydrophila. high-throughput paired-end sequencing yielded a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads. of these,  <dig>  reads containing more than five consecutive bases with a quality <  <dig> were removed. the remaining  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads were assembled into  <dig>  scaffolds by using the soap de novo software, with a maximum scaffold length of  <dig> bp. the length statistics of all scaffolds are presented in figure  <dig> 

scaffold annotation was achieved through blastn similarity searches against the zebrafish refseq mrna database . this analysis revealed that  <dig>  of the  <dig>  scaffolds  shared homology with zebrafish genes when a cutoff e-value of 1e- <dig> was used. scaffolds were clustered if two or more query sequences were annotated to the same zebrafish gene. ultimately,  <dig> unigenes were obtained. scaffolds that did not display any similarity to zebrafish genes were further searched against the nonredundant  database, and  <dig> unigenes were obtained after clustering. in total,  <dig> unigenes were identified in the transcriptome of the large yellow croaker . the remaining  <dig>  scaffolds failed to match proteins in the nr database and therefore represented potentially novel genes.

gene ontology  analysis of these genes was performed using the web-based database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery   <cit> . among the  <dig> unigenes, david had functional annotation for  <dig> genes. the david functional annotation analysis for go  is summarized in table  <dig>  sequences with go terms corresponding to the "cellular component" group fell into  <dig> subcategories, "molecular function" into  <dig> subcategories, and "biological process" into  <dig> subcategories. the largest subcategory found in the "cellular component" group was 'cell part,' which comprised  <dig> % of the genes in this subcategory. in the "molecular function" and "biological process" categories, "nucleotide binding" and "primary metabolic process" were the most abundant go terms, making up  <dig> % and  <dig> % of each subcategory, respectively.

*, indicates the percentage of genes in the specific subcategory from each of the three go ontologies.

to identify the biological pathways that are active in the large yellow croaker, we mapped the  <dig> genes to canonical signaling pathways found in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes . a total of  <dig> genes of the large yellow croaker transcriptome were mapped to kegg, and  <dig> statistically remarkable categories  are listed in table  <dig>  the mitogen-activated protein kinase  signaling pathway, neurotrophin signaling pathway, and chemokine signaling pathway were identified as statistically significant. in fact,  <dig> genes were found to be related to the mapk pathway. other major immune pathways, such as those mediated by the t cell receptor  and b cell receptor , were also statistically significant.

*, indicates the percentage of genes in each pathway from  <dig> genes mapped to kegg.

global changes in gene expression upon a. hydrophila infection
to characterize the immune response of the large yellow croaker to bacterial infection, two deepsage libraries were constructed using mrna from spleens injected with a. hydrophila or  <dig> % nacl. after removal of the low-quality tags, adaptor tags, and one copynumber tag, a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean tags were obtained from the two libraries with  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique nucleotide sequences, respectively . subsequently, the tag sequences from the infected and control libraries were mapped to the transcriptome database described above. approximately 50% of the tags matched sequences in the transcriptome, while 39% could be identified unequivocally by unique tag mapping . a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes  were found , including  <dig> upregulated genes and  <dig> downregulated genes, in the spleen of fish infected with a. hydrophila. particularly,  <dig> genes were upregulated at least  <dig> -fold, including  <dig> genes that were unique to the infected library, while  <dig> genes were downregulated at least  <dig> -fold, including  <dig> genes uniquely expressed in the control library.

to achieve a functional annotation of the infection-responsive genes, go classifications were assigned to the  <dig> differentially expressed genes by using david . go analysis indicated that bacterial infection up- and downregulated genes involved in immunity, transcription, translation regulations, and biological regulation.

some significantly differentially expressed genes in expression profiles using go classifications are shown in table  <dig>  the immune-related genes were enriched in go terms "response to chemical stimulus" and "immune system development." relative quantitative real-time pcr analysis was also performed to confirm the differentially expression genes. these genes were mapped to kegg and found to be associated with the toll-like receptor  signaling pathway . this group included tlr genes , cytokine genes , and chemokine and chemokine receptor genes . additionally, apoptosis-related genes, including casp <dig> and fas, as well as those involved in antioxidant activity such as prdx <dig>  prdx <dig>  gpx1b, and gpx4b were discovered. genes involved in b cell and t cell development, such as blnk and cd3ζ/d, were also found to be differentially expressed . the b cell linker protein , also known as slp- <dig>  is essential for normal b cell development by influencing the bcr signaling pathway  <cit> . the tcr/cd3ζ complex mediates antigen recognition and t cell stimulation, with cd3ζ/d playing a pivotal role in this process  <cit> .

limitations of all differentially expressed genes are based on p <  <dig> . a p value <  <dig>  indicated that the gene was significantly altered after bacterial challenge. the absolute value of "fold" means the magnitude of up- or downregulation for each gene/homolog after bacterial challenge; "+" indicates upregulation, "-" indicates downregulation, and "0" indicates the gene was not found in one library. "accession no" is genbank identifiers for the conformable reference sequences.

many genes in the transcription regulation group were upregulated by a. hydrophila infection. this group includes genes encoding nf-κb <dig>  nf-κbie, irf <dig>  irf <dig>  jund, jak <dig>  stat <dig>  cebpa, and cebpb . nf-κb is a transcription factor involved in regulating a large number of genes, especially cytokine genes  <cit> . jak <dig> and stat <dig> are components of the jak-stat signaling pathway. the remaining genes were represented by go terms such as cellular component, binding, catalytic activity, structural molecular activity, and growth. these biological functions and pathways have not been associated directly with a particular immune-related event. meanwhile, a number of uniquely expressed genes were hypothetical proteins, and future identification of these genes and their function may provide new insights into the immune response to a. hydrophila infection.

genmapp analysis reveals genes involved in tcr and mapk signaling
to further explore the immune response profiles induced by a. hydrophila infection to the level of a single pathway, we performed a map-based pathway analysis by using the genmapp software package http://www.genmapp.org/. in our study,  <dig> mus musculus homologs were used to create the genmapp. mus musculus homologs were identified by searching the  <dig> unigenes against the zebrafish refseq data downloaded from the ucsc website http://genome.ucsc.edu/ and then the database of homologene at the ncbi http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. genmapp analysis was performed to identify genes involved in the mapk pathway . in total, seven genes were identified as highly upregulated upon infection, casp <dig>  prkcb <dig>  hspa <dig>  radd45a, dusp <dig>  rac <dig>  and casp <dig>  contrarily, four genes were highly downregulated in response to a. hydrophila infection, map3k <dig>  crkl, jun, and raf <dig> . we also used genmapp to analyze genes involved in tcr signaling. t cell activation, a key event in adaptive immunity, promotes a variety of signaling cascades that ultimately lead to cytokine production, cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation  <cit> . the resultant map  revealed eight remarkably downregulated genes  and seven remarkably upregulated genes  involved in tcr signaling after a. hydrophila infection .

discussion
at present, molecular studies on the immune response to pathogens in the large yellow croaker are still rare. to increase our knowledge of host responses to bacterial infection, we firstly analyzed the transcriptome profile of the fish after a. hydrophila infection. bioinformatic analysis of rna-seq data should involve mapping of short reads to the genome  <cit> . however, genome and transcriptome resources for most vertebrate species have not yet been obtained, including the large yellow croaker. we analyzed the transcriptome of the large yellow croaker in advance and obtained a mass of sequence information. then quantitative gene expression profile analysis was performed, and the tags were mapped to obtained transcriptome database. in the set of highly differentially expressed genes, a number of genes were reported to be involved in immunity and signal transduction, encoding receptors, cytokines, innate defense molecules, enzymes, signal transducers, transcription factors, and other functional proteins.

the innate immune system represents an efficient first line of defense against invading microbial pathogens. tlrs signal the presence of pathogens and elicit an innate immune response. this process has been reported in zebrafish infected with mycobacterium marinum  <cit> . our data revealed  <dig> genes involved in tlr cascades in the transcriptome of infected large yellow croaker and  <dig> differentially expressed genes in expression profiles . tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> function together to recognize lipopeptides with a triacylated n-terminal cysteine. tlr <dig> is only mildly expressed in t. nigroviridis tissues and slightly upregulated in the spleens of lps-injected fish  <cit> . our data demonstrated that tlr <dig> was upregulated while tlr <dig> was downregulated at  <dig> h after a. hydrophila infection . this result was partly consistent with that reported by baoprasertkul et al., in which tlr <dig> expression in the spleens of channel and blue catfish was downregulated initially but upregulated  <dig> day postinfection with edwardsiella ictaluri  <cit> . bacterial infection has also been shown to induce tlr <dig> mrna expression in zebrafish and channel catfish, as well as in channel-blue backcross hybrids following infection with e. tarda and e. ictaluri  <cit> . in our study, tlr <dig> expression was also upregulated  <dig> -fold postinfection , suggesting that this receptor might be involved in the immune response to bacterial infection in fish in addition to recognizing double-stranded rna as in mammals. tlr <dig> is a fish-specific member of this family  <cit>  that has also been found in the large yellow croaker. recently, tlr <dig> was found located on the pufferfish cell surface recognizing long dsrna sequences, whereas mammalian nucleic acid-sensing tlrs are localized in endosomes or the er of myeloid cells, indicating that tlr <dig> may be a functional substitute for mammalian tlr <dig> that monitors for infections by double-stranded rna viruses  <cit> . tlr <dig> was downregulated in the expression profile, implying that tlr <dig> was suppressed in the early period of a. hydrophila infection. taken together, these results indicate that tlrs are regulated by various components of gram-negative bacteria, suggesting that multiple tlr-mediated signaling cascades may simultaneously be involved in immune response to bacterial infection.

in our study, a. hydrophila infection led to a dramatic increase in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as il-1β, il- <dig>  and tnf-α . studies have reported that these cytokines are induced within  <dig> h in human monocytes following gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infection  <cit> . il-1β is considered the prototypic multifunctional cytokine that affects nearly all cell types, either alone or in combination with other cytokines response to infection, injury, or immunologic challenge  <cit> . il- <dig> is a proinflammatory cxc chemokine that has been shown to be regulated by a number of different stimuli including inflammatory signals , chemical and environmental stresses, and steroid hormones  <cit> . here, upregulation of these cytokines was observed by real-time pcr , which is consistent with the observed findings in deepsage. therefore, the upregulation of these proinflammatory cytokines strongly suggests that the proinflammatory response may represent an important antibacterial mechanism at the early phase of infection.

the jak-stat pathway is initiated in response to cytokines, such as interleukins and ifns, and growth factors present in the surrounding microenvironment  <cit> . jak <dig> is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that noncovalently associates with a variety of cytokine receptors and plays a nonredundant role in lymphoid cell precursor proliferation, survival, and differentiation  <cit> . stat <dig>  after activation by ifn-γ signaling, leads to the activation of peritoneal macrophages, resulting in enhanced bacteria killing and protection against lethal levels of listeria monocytogenes infection in mice  <cit> . genes encoding jak-stat pathway members, including jak <dig> and stat <dig>  were found to be upregulated in our study , suggesting that the jak-stat pathway may be affected by bacterial infection, which may result in changes in other cross-talk biological processes, such as nf-κb signaling pathway, tgf-β-activated smad pathway, and apoptosis  <cit> .

another signaling pathway affected by bacterial infection in the large yellow croaker was the mapk cascade. this pathway has been demonstrated to regulate the expression of genes involved in the immune response to pathogens  <cit> , cell differentiation, and cell death  <cit> . modulation of mapk activity in the common periwinkle in response to escherichia coli-derived lps has been studied  <cit> . some key mapk-related genes were identified in our transcriptome, including casp <dig>  rac <dig>  gadd45α, and dusp <dig> . quantitative pcr analysis confirmed the differential expression of casp <dig> and dusp <dig> . the rho family gtpase rac <dig> has been implicated in the control of the p <dig> mapk signaling pathway by controlling β <dig> integrin. as shown in humans, dominant-negative rac <dig> completely inhibits β <dig> integrin-induced p <dig> mapk activation, whereas wild-type rac <dig> overexpression causes a slight increase in β <dig> integrin-induced p <dig> mapk activation  <cit> . dual-specificity phosphatases including dusp <dig> are a subset of protein tyrosine phosphatases, many of which dephosphorylate threonine and tyrosine residues on mapks and hence are also referred to as mapk phosphatases . the regulated expression and activity of dusp family members in different cells and tissues control mapk intensity and duration to determine the type of physiological response  <cit> . therefore, the identified changes in gene expression in the large yellow croaker may facilitate the activation of the mapk pathway and protect hosts against a. hydrophila infection.

adaptive immunity is the process that leads to specific host resistance to infection  <cit> . t cells orchestrate responses against such foreign pathogens as viruses and bacteria. tcr and its downstream signaling cascades play a key role in these events. here, we identified tcr pathway-related genes that were downregulated at  <dig> h after a. hydrophila infection. this complex process is shown in figure  <dig>  and genes expressed differentially are listed in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  lyn, itk, was, ptpn <dig>  and jun expression was downregulated, implying that the tcr signaling pathway may be suppressed in the early period  following bacterial infection. studies have shown that a fine balance exists between a positive signal that initiates tcr cascade and a negative signal that controls the threshold, extent, and termination of tcr activation  <cit> . several protein tyrosine phosphatases  have been shown to function as negative regulators of the tcr signaling pathway by dephosphorylating activated signaling molecules  <cit> . here, expression of ptpn <dig>  a member of the ptp family  <cit> , was downregulated , suggesting that although the tcr signaling pathway was suppressed by a. hydrophila, the host began to downregulate the expression of the ptps to antagonize the repression. clearly, there is a need for further studies to elucidate the precise roles of the ptp family members in the tcr signaling pathway in fish.

CONCLUSIONS
several recent studies have exploited novel high-throughput deep sequencing technology as a new method to advance further understanding of the mechanism of fish defense against infection  <cit> . we used the a. hydrophila-infected large yellow croaker as a model to study the immune response of fish to bacterial infection. our analysis of the transcriptome and gene expression in a. hydrophila-infected large yellow croaker revealed changes in multiple signaling pathways involved in immunity in the large yellow croaker. the multiple tlr-mediated signaling cascades may be involved in early response to bacterial infection, causing the production of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and other cytokines, which may result in the inflammatory response and affect other signal pathways such as jak-stat and mapk. however, the tcr signaling pathway, a pivotal process in cellular immunity, was suppressed in the early period of a. hydrophila infection. the immune-related genes and signaling pathways involved in bacterial infection were identified and thereby provided valuable leads for further investigations into the immune response of fish.
