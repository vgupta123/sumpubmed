BACKGROUND
viruses form a substantial portion of the human microbiome, and many have previously been identified as bacteriophage living in association with the numerous cellular microbes that inhabit human body surfaces  <cit> . relative to their bacterial counterparts, there have been comparatively few studies characterizing human viral communities  <cit> . many of these studies of human viruses generally have been limited to cross-sectional analyses, where little could be ascertained about the stability or the rate of turnover of viruses in these environments. moreover, the effects of environment on the composition of human viral communities have not been thoroughly examined. we recently demonstrated that individuals living together are significantly more likely to have similar oral viruses  <cit> .

crisprs  are part of the crispr/cas system in bacteria and archaea and mediate an adaptive immune response against invading viruses. they function by acquiring short sequences from invading viruses into the crispr locus, and counteract future infections through nucleic acid interference  <cit> . because crispr loci acquire and accumulate short viral sequences, they have been used to trace viral exposures  <cit> . in addition to having similar oral viruses, household members also have significant similarities in their crispr spacer profiles  <cit> , suggesting that oral crispr spacers may evolve as a result of each individual’s oral virome composition.

while certain human sample types such as saliva, feces, and respiratory secretions provide sufficient biomass to characterize viral populations  <cit> , the skin generally presents a more challenging body surface on which to characterize viruses. because of a general lack of starting material, analysis of the skin microbiome mostly has been limited to analysis of those microbes on skin swabs or scrapings  <cit> . to analyze skin viral populations, foulongne et al. recently used high-throughput sequencing techniques to sequence the skin metagenome, and to analyze those viruses present by targeted analysis of viral reads  <cit> . in most human sample types, the majority of the viruses present have been identified as bacteriophage  <cit> , which may reflect the  <dig> to  <dig> proportion of bacterial to human cells in these environments. in analysis of the skin virome, however, bacteriophage constituted only a small proportion of the metagenome sequences  <cit> . by examining the crispr spacer profiles of the skin, we may improve our understanding of the sequence features of viruses to which skin bacteria have previously encountered.

study of the human microbiome has detailed unique populations of microbes inhabiting different body surfaces. while the oral cavity and the skin surfaces differ substantially in their bacterial constituents, they share some bacterial genera including some species from the genus streptococcus <cit> . streptococci generally are present on the skin and in the saliva of most humans  <cit> , and represent a substantial proportion of the oral microbiota and a much smaller proportion of the skin microbiota  <cit> . the human oral cavity is known to harbor various types of viridans streptococci, including s. mutans, s. gordonii, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. milleri , s. sanguinis, and s. parasanguinis, and also some non-viridans streptococci, including s. bovis . the skin generally harbors different species of streptococci, including s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae, which belong to lancefield groups a and b, respectively. the skin also is known to harbor streptococci that belong to lancefield groups c and g  <cit> . in this study, we sought to characterize the crispr profiles present in a cohort of human subjects on both their skin and in their oral cavities. our goals were to determine whether there were similar crispr profiles among streptococci on human skin and saliva, whether crispr content on the skin and saliva was relatively conserved over time, and whether there were crispr spacers present on human skin that matched viruses present in saliva.

RESULTS
crispr spacer sequencing
we sampled  <dig> human subjects with good overall cutaneous and periodontal health, collecting skin swabs and saliva samples  <dig> times per day on days # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig>  and week # <dig>  skin and saliva samples were collected at the same time in the am prior to breakfast or oral hygiene , approximately noon each day before lunch , and in the early evening prior to dinner  <cit> . skin samples were collected from the volar surface of the forearm, as prior studies utilizing this surface provide insight into its indigenous microbes  <cit> . we analyzed streptococcus group i  and streptococcus group ii  crisprs, by amplifying them based on their consensus repeat motifs   <cit> . these crispr repeat motifs are present in a variety of different streptococcal species, including s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae that are primarily found on the skin, and numerous different viridans streptococci such as s. mutans, s. gordonii, s. mitis, and s. sanguinis that are found in the oral cavity . the benefits of this approach were that we could analyze crispr spacers from numerous streptococcal species simultaneously and were not limited to examining individual crispr loci. the main drawbacks of this technique were that it was difficult to ascribe the spacers to any single crispr locus or bacterial species, and the consensus repeat motifs could be present in some non-streptococcal species. we amplified crisprs from all subjects, sample types, and time points, and sequenced  <dig> , <dig> crispr spacers consisting of  <dig> , <dig> sgi and  <dig> , <dig> sgii spacers using semiconductor sequencing  <cit>  . there were  <dig> , <dig> spacers obtained from saliva and  <dig> , <dig> spacers obtained from skin. for all time points combined, we found  <dig> , <dig> spacers for subject # <dig>   <dig>  spacers for subject # <dig>   <dig> , <dig> for subject # <dig>  and  <dig>  spacers for subject # <dig> 

spacer binning and estimated coverage
we binned each of the crispr spacers according to trinucleotide content according to our previously described protocols  <cit> . the majority of the crispr spacers identified in each subject and time point were identical to other spacers, with only  <dig> % of sgi and  <dig> % of sgii spacers identified as having polymorphisms that necessitated grouping according to trinucleotide content. we sequenced an average of  <dig>  spacers per time point and sample type in each subject to capture the majority of the crispr spacer diversity in these environments. we then performed rarefaction analysis on all subjects by crispr and sample type to estimate how thoroughly each had been evaluated. we found that all curves neared asymptote for all subjects, sample types, and time points, with the exception of subject# <dig> in the evening of week  <dig> for sgii crispr spacers .

crispr spacer distribution
we compared crispr spacers and their relative abundances across all time points in each subject to determine how spacers in each subject were distributed over time. at each time point, many of the spacers found at early time points persisted throughout later time points , indicating that many of the sgi and sgii crispr spacers were conserved throughout the study period. we quantified the proportions of persistent sgi salivary spacers and found 61% to be persistent in subject # <dig>  62% in subject # <dig>  36% in subject # <dig>  and 49% in subject # <dig> . this was similar for sgii salivary spacers  . there was a smaller yet similar group of spacers on the skin of each subject for sgi spacers  and sgii spacers  persisting throughout the study. many of the conserved spacers in saliva matched spacers on the skin of each subject for sgi spacers  and sgii spacers .

we measured the relative conservation of sgii and sgi spacers by time of day sampled to determine whether there were biases in crispr spacer profiles on the skin and in the saliva based on sampling times. we found that in the saliva, there was significantly greater conservation  of crispr spacer profiles in the am for both sgii  and sgi spacers . similar conservation of crispr spacer profiles were not found for noon and pm time points for either sgii or sgi spacers in saliva . because the saliva samples were collected prior to meals and oral hygiene practices in the am, while the noon sample was collected after breakfast and oral hygiene and the pm time point was collected after lunch, we believe that the substantial time between disturbances for the am time points resulted in greater stability of the oral bacteria harboring these crispr loci. similar results were not found on the skin for any time points . we did not control for skin-related hygiene practices, which may have affected the skin microbiota.

when compared to skin spacers, the proportion of shared spacers in saliva over time in each subject was highly significant  . in some cases there were more shared spacers between skin and saliva than there were for comparisons of different time points within the skin of the same subject for sgii spacers  and for sgi spacers . these data demonstrate a smaller group of shared spacers present on the skin of these subjects than in their saliva, which suggests greater heterogeneity in the skin microbiota.

we also examined spacers shared between different subjects and whether there were any sgi crispr spacers shared with sgii spacers. on average,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the sgi spacers were shared between subjects,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the sgii spacers were shared between subjects, while only  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  of the sgi and sgii spacers were shared between subjects, indicating that either sgi and sgii spacers likely target different viruses/plasmids, or target different portions of the same viruses/plasmids  <cit> .

crispr locus assembly
because of the short read lengths of most of the sequences produced in this study, crispr loci could not be assembled; however, longer reads sequenced from the day 14 am sample from subject # <dig> could be assembled into loci. by using adjacent spacers as scaffolds, we were able to reconstruct  <dig> different crispr loci in the saliva and  <dig> different crispr loci on the skin. of the  <dig> loci reconstructed in the saliva,  <dig> shared at least  <dig> spacer with loci reproduced on the skin . we identified crispr loci that were identical between the skin and saliva , that shared a common end , that shared a common middle , and that only shared a single spacer flanked by spacers not present at the other body site . only a single spacer from any of these  <dig> loci is identical to any previously sequenced spacers. these data suggest that at least some of the shared spacers on the saliva and skin were derived from loci with shared spacer content and order.

analysis of crispr spacer variation
because there were shared spacers between the saliva and skin of each subject , we tested whether the variation present in the spacers in the saliva versus the skin was unique based on environment. principal coordinates analysis of the crispr spacer repertoires examining only the presence/absence of spacers demonstrated that at most time points the biogeographic site was an important determinant of diversity for sgi spacers  and sgii spacers . we also used a permutation test  <cit>  to determine whether there was a significant association amongst the spacers by biogeographic site . briefly, we tested whether the fraction of shared spacers amongst the skin spacers or amongst the salivary spacers would be greater than for comparisons of spacers on the skin against spacers in saliva. we performed this test by randomly sampling  <dig>  spacers from each subject over  <dig>  iterations. we found that the estimated fraction of shared spacers over time amongst the salivary spacers was highly significant  . the estimated fraction of shared spacers amongst the skin spacers of each subject was no greater than for comparisons of skin against saliva, with no significant relationships found. these data indicate that there is a highly significant group of shared sgi and sgii crispr spacers present in saliva that is not paralleled on the skin of each subject.

we also examined crispr repertoires by collapsing all time points between subjects to determine whether the crispr spacers in each environment were a direct reflection of the subject and environment from which they were derived. when considering both the presence of spacers and their abundance in skin and saliva, we found that for most subjects the crispr repertoires were significantly subject-specific . we estimated that 94% of the sgii spacers were conserved across the skin and saliva of subject # <dig> compared to only 35% when comparing between different subjects . similar results were produced for all subjects for both sgi and sgii crispr spacers with the exception of subject # <dig> . while the results did not reach statistical significance for subject# <dig>  the trends in the proportions of intra-subject shared spacers between skin and saliva exceeded inter-subject comparisons substantially .

crispr spacer matches
we tested whether the spacer repertoires from skin and saliva matched similar viruses . we found that  <dig> % of saliva-derived and  <dig> % of skin-derived sgii spacers were homologous to streptococcal viruses in the ncbi non-redundant  database, and  <dig> % of saliva-derived and  <dig> % of skin-derived sgi spacers were homologous to streptococcal viruses. comparatively, only  <dig> % of saliva-derived and  <dig> % of skin-derived sgii spacers were homologous to streptococcal plasmids, and  <dig> % of saliva-derived and  <dig> % of skin-derived sgi spacers were homologous to streptococcal plasmids. in all cases, the proportion of skin-derived spacers with homologues in the nr database was significantly  greater than that for saliva-derived spacers. we created heatmaps of the spacer homologues across all time points for both saliva and skin, where only spacers that were newly identified at each time point were included. for many of the viral homologues, newly identified spacers targeted different portions of the same viruses over time for both sgi spacers  and sgii spacers , suggesting that the bacteria harboring these crispr spacers either acquired additional resistance motifs against the same or similar viruses or that new bacterial strains harboring spacers targeting these viruses entered the community. most of the viruses that matched crispr spacers in this study were previously identified in s. thermophilus and s. pneumoniae. we also noted that  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the sgii and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the sgi spacers on the skin matched the same viruses as those spacers identified in saliva. approximately  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the sgii and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the sgi crispr spacers from different subjects matched the same viruses. a few of the spacers matched viruses found in species of lactococcus, which are closely related to streptococcus.

we also compared the crispr spacers from the skin and saliva of all subjects to determine whether there might be spacers in our cohort that matched those identified in previously sequenced crispr loci. we found that 2-8% of the crispr spacers were also found in loci from the crispr database  <cit> , with the number of skin spacers found in the database generally exceeding salivary spacers . while there were spacers identified that matched loci from many different streptococcal species, the majority of the loci belonged to s. thermophilus. for example, many of the sgii 3’ spacers from crispr locus  <dig> of s. thermophilus lmg <dig> were identified on the skin of subject # <dig>  but only  <dig> of those spacers was identified in the saliva . all of the sgii spacers in locus  <dig> of s. thermophilus mn-zlw- <dig> were identified on the skin of subject # <dig>  but  <dig> was missing in the saliva of that subject . similar patterns of shared spacers were found in subjects # <dig> and # <dig> . sgi spacers also matched spacers from various s. thermophilus loci . these data suggest that loci similar to those isolated from s. thermophilus were sampled on both the skin and saliva of our study subjects.

to determine whether skin-derived crispr spacers matched viruses present in the saliva, we sequenced the viromes present in each of our subjects’ saliva on day  <dig> and week  <dig>  similar to our previous studies  <cit> , the proportion of crispr spacers matching virome reads was relatively low. when examining the pooled reads from all subjects, we found that between  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the crispr spacers in each subject matched virome reads for sgi spacers and sgii spacers . when we tested the skin- and saliva-derived spacers against a larger database of salivary viromes from a cohort  <dig> human subjects  <cit> , we found that a high number of salivary- and skin-derived spacers matched salivary virome reads . the proportion of spacers matching salivary viruses was significantly  higher for saliva-derived spacers than for skin-derived spacers for subjects # <dig> and # <dig> for sgii spacers, but not subjects # <dig> and # <dig>  there also were a significantly higher proportion of sgi saliva-derived spacers that matched salivary viruses in subjects # <dig> and # <dig>  but not subjects # <dig> and # <dig> .

we also tested whether there were matches to spacers found in previously sequences metagenomes recovered from the human oral cavity  <cit> , the gastrointestinal tract  <cit> , and human skin  <cit> . we found that a significantly higher percentage of sgii  and sgi  spacer sequences were found in oral metagenomes than the 1-2% of sgii and sgi found in the gut and the <1% found on the skin  . while the significant difference between spacers shared between oral and gut metagenomes is consistent with a prior study  <cit> , the lack of spacers found on skin metagenomes may be secondary to the different surfaces sampled between studies, where the retroauricular surface was sampled to produce the skin metagenomes compared to the volar forearm surface used in this study.

spacer rate change
little is known about the rate at which spacers are acquired for bacteria in human ecosystems. due to our repeat motif based amplification approach, we were unable to discern between newly acquired spacers in existing bacteria and those that may be newly identified because of new bacteria entering the environment. we could, however, compare the estimated rates of newly identified spacers between skin and saliva. to estimate the number of spacers at each time point, we corrected for the probability that any spacer present at a given time point might not be observed due to variations in sampling. for sgii spacers the estimated rate of newly identified spacers per hour for skin exceeded that for saliva in all subjects, and was significant  for  <dig> of the  <dig> subjects . similar trends were not observed for sgi spacers , where only in subject # <dig> did the estimated rate for skin significantly exceed saliva. the overall rate per hour of newly identified sgii spacers was significantly higher for skin  than for saliva , while it was similar for skin  and saliva  for sgi spacers.

bacterial community variation
because many of the sgi and sgii crispr spacers were subject specific and shared between skin and saliva, we also characterized the bacterial communities in each subject to ensure that the microbiota of each body site were distinct. we sequenced a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads from the v <dig> region of 16s rrna, for an average of  <dig>  reads per time point and sample type for all subjects over the 8-week study period. we performed principal coordinates analysis for the bacterial communities to determine whether the variation in these communities may be subject specific and reflective of the body site from which they were derived, as had been demonstrated for sgi and sgii crisprs . the majority of the variation observed between skin and saliva was on the x-axis, which accounted for 66% of the observed variation . the bacterial communities from both saliva and skin appeared to be highly specific to the body site examined, but not subject specific. we quantified the proportion of shared otus  within and between the skin and saliva of each subject, and found that there was a significant proportion conserved in the saliva of each subject . while only subjects # <dig>  # <dig>  and # <dig> had significant proportions of shared otus  on the skin, the proportion shared on the skin of subject # <dig> substantially exceeded those shared between the saliva and skin . there also was a greater abundance of streptococci in the saliva than on the skin of each subject  . these data indicate that while there were discernible differences between the bacterial communities and crispr spacer profiles of the skin and saliva for each subject, only the crispr spacer profiles were subject specific.

discussion
the study of viruses inhabiting body surfaces is still in its relative infancy. because little biomass can be obtained non-invasively from the skin, viral communities on this surface remain relatively poorly characterized. others have begun to characterize some of the features of the viruses in this broad ecosystem  <cit> , yet their analysis has not identify many viruses of bacteria. because of the abundance of bacteria inhabiting human skin, the skin might be expected to be inhabited by many bacteriophage, as has previously been demonstrated for the human oral cavity  <cit>  and gut  <cit> . we sampled crisprs because their profiles may shed light into the diverse features and types of viruses to which streptococci on the skin might encounter in nature, and might be contrasted with viruses found in saliva. while we found many spacers on skin that matched those of saliva, many may belong to loci that have been either vertically or horizontally inherited; thus, the similarities between skin and salivary crispr spacer profiles may not reflect independent viral encounters. it does represent an intriguing possibility that bacteria on the skin and saliva encounter similar viruses, but this study was not designed to demonstrate that phenomenon.

while there were relatively few crispr spacers that matched salivary viruses from the subjects in this study, there were many that matched viruses from a larger cohort of different subjects  <cit> . we previously demonstrated that crispr spacer/virome matches generally are not subject specific  <cit> , and we believe that this phenomenon may be due to heterogenous representation of viruses between different subjects. for example, similar viruses may be present in both subjects, but in one subject one virus may be highly abundant at the time of sampling, while in another subject it is not. therefore, by comparing crispr spacers to viromes from multiple subjects, we may identify matches to viruses that are of otherwise too low an abundance to be identified in our cohort.

the repeat-based amplification technique used in this study was not without limitations, including that we could not ascribe most spacers to bacterial species or crispr loci  <cit> . additionally, crispr spacers could have been amplified from loci that are similar but not identical to sgii and sgi crispr repeat motifs  <cit> . by removing any altered crispr repeat motifs from the analysis, we also could limit the potential effect of amplifying non-streptococcal species that might bear similar repeat motifs. we believe that much of the similarity observed in our analysis of sgi and sgii crisprs between the skin and saliva was due to the presence of different streptococcal species harboring these repeat motifs on both body sites, as the vast majority of homologous sequences found to our crispr spacers were from streptococcal phage, plasmids, and genomes. we attempted to find and include spacer sequences from crispr repeat motifs not known to be present in streptococcus, including repeat motifs found in species of gemella, veillonella, leptotrichia, and kingella, but their presence was not uniform on the skin .

because of the error rate of ion torrent sequencing  <cit> , we took additional precautions to reduce sequencing error biases in our analysis of crispr spacers. each crispr-bearing read was trimmed according to quality scores, and was removed if it had significant homopolymer tracts. we specifically removed any crispr-bearing reads from the analysis that did not match the known consensus repeat motifs, as those reads were more likely to contain sequencing errors. the combination of these techniques reduced the error rate from approximately 1% to an estimated  <dig>  and  <dig> % for sgi and sgii crispr spacers, respectively. our previous studies of crispr repertoires in humans had been performed using conventional sanger sequencing, however we now have extended our analysis using next-generation sequencing techniques. the primary benefit of the current technique was that we were able to achieve greater sampling depth, which allowed for more robust comparisons of skin and salivary crisprs with fewer unsampled spacers.

our data on shared crispr spacers between skin and saliva revealed several qualities about crisprs on human body surfaces: 1) fewer spacers were shared between subjects than within subjects, suggesting that crispr repertoires were individual specific, 2) the substantial persistence of spacers, suggesting that the bacteria harboring them were conserved over the time period studied, and 3) the level of shared spacers between skin and saliva in individual subjects , which raises the possibility that skin-derived bacteria may have encountered viruses with similar sequences to those in the mouth. while it is possible that some of the spacers were acquired through independent means  <cit> , the substantial levels of shared spacers between skin and saliva suggests some vertical or horizontal acquisitions. despite our inability to reconstruct many crispr loci using this short-read technology, our finding that many spacers from previously sequenced s. thermophilus isolates were present in this cohort suggests that those loci may be present in this study with their spacer content and order intact. because the location of the crispr loci in our subjects was variable, we were unable investigate them robustly by pcr amplification using their flanking regions, followed by sanger sequencing.

we initially hypothesized that there would be large groups of spacers specific to saliva and specific to skin that would be unique to each body surface. we found that there was a group of salivary spacers that were highly persistent over the 8-week study period, but the same trend was not true for skin spacers . we believe that the lower level of spacer persistence on skin may be secondary to increased heterogeneity in skin bacterial populations over time. we analyzed the bacterial populations using 16s rrna specifically to substantiate that there were differences between skin and salivary microbiota in these subjects, as the substantial levels of shared crispr spacers between the body sites in such a large dataset were unexpected. the segment of 16s rrna sequenced was not sufficient to differentiate different streptococci at the species level, but was sufficient to discern differences between the microbiota of each body site.

CONCLUSIONS
we aimed to characterize streptococcal crispr spacer profiles of distinct human biogeographic sites to determine whether crispr spacers were highly conserved over time. we found that there were robust repertoires of spacers from both sites, but neither profiles were fully ecologically distinct. there were abundant shared spacers between the skin and saliva of all  <dig> subjects , suggesting vertical or horizontal acquisition of crispr loci among the streptococci inhabiting these body sites. the significant group of temporally conserved spacers in saliva was much larger than that found on skin , which might reflect a higher diversity of cutaneous bacterial strains. while many of the crispr spacers identified in saliva matched concurrent viruses in saliva, the relatively high proportion of skin-derived spacers matching salivary viruses warrants further study to determine whether streptococci on the skin may encounter viruses with similar sequences to those in the mouth.
