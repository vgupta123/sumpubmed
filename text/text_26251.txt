BACKGROUND
plant growth and development are regulated by the coordinated expression of thousands of genes at every moment throughout their lives. transcription factors  play a key role in these processes by self-regulating or regulating the transcription of downstream target genes. they usually consist of at least four discrete domains, namely a dna-binding domain , a nuclear localization signal, a transcription-activation domain, and an oligomerization site  <cit> . these domains function together to mediate many physiological and biochemical processes, and to activate and/or repress transcription in response to endogenous and exogenous stimuli  <cit> . additionally, most tfs are members of gene families, thereby making their regulation more complex, but also more orderly  <cit> .

the myb superfamily is one of the largest tf families in plants  <cit> . myb proteins are found in all eukaryotes  <cit>  and are defined by a highly conserved myb dbd at the n-terminus  <cit> . the myb domain is highly conserved among eukaryotes and forms 1– <dig> imperfect repeats  with a consensus sequence of approximately  <dig> amino acid residues. moreover, each repeat contains regularly spread triplet tryptophan  residues, forming a hydrophobic core structure  <cit> . the higher structure of each repeat is composed of three α-helices. the latter two helices form the hth  structure and bind to the promoters of target genes  <cit> . the third helix plays a crucial role in dna recognition  <cit> . in general, these dbds are localized to the n-terminus of mybs, while their c-termini function as trans-acting domains  and vary considerably, which leads to the wide range of regulatory roles for the myb gene family  <cit> . myb transcription factors have been separated into four classes named 1r-, r2r3-, 3r- and 4r-myb proteins according to the number of dbd repeats  <cit> .

the first identified plant myb gene was c <dig>  isolated from zea mays, and encodes a c-myb-like transcription factor that regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit> . an increasing number of plant r2r3-myb superfamily members have been identified subsequently and characterized in numerous plants, such as arabidopsis, grape, maize, petunia and snapdragon  <cit> . plant r2r3-myb proteins play important roles in many biological processes including cell metabolism  <cit> , cell fate, development  <cit>  and stress responses  <cit> . in addition, 3r-mybs only account for a very small proportion; for example, arabidopsis thaliana contains only five 3r-myb genes, compared with up to  <dig> r2r3-myb and myb-related genes  <cit> .

recently, numerous studies have shown that myb family transcription factors play roles in plant stress responses. atmyb <dig> functions as a negative regulator in the cbf pathway in response to cold stress in arabidopsis  <cit> . osmyb <dig>  a rice myb gene, has been shown to respond to salt, cold, and dehydration stresses  <cit> . the wheat tamybsdu <dig> gene has been reported to act as a potentially important regulator in tolerance to salt and drought stresses  <cit> . ammyb <dig> from avicennia marina regulates the response processes under salt stress and transgenic tobacco plants expressing it showed better tolerance to nacl stress  <cit> . wang et al. have reported that transferring apple mdsimyb <dig> to both tobacco and apple could increase tolerance to multiple stresses  <cit> .

r2r3-myb family transcription factors participate in multiple plant-specific processes, raising the hypothesis that their expansion may be responsible for the diversity of plant evolution  <cit> . r2r3-myb families from several sequenced plants such as arabidopsis, rice, corn, wheat, barley and soybean have been identified  <cit> . however, studies on r2r3-myb tfs from vegetable crops have been limited and unsystematic so far. chinese cabbage  is a vital cruciferae brassica vegetable, but the functions of only a few chinese cabbage r2r3-myb  genes  are known  <cit> . therefore, it is very important to characterize the roles of r2r3-brmybs and to achieve complete identification and classification of these genes. in this study, we first identified  <dig> myb family members in chinese cabbage and then systematically analyzed their organization, collinearity and stress-responsive expression patterns. our results showed the functional diversity of the r2r3-brmyb genes, which may be involved in plant development, stress responses and leaf senescence.

RESULTS
identification and conserved dbd analysis of myb tfs in chinese cabbage
to define the brmyb gene family, we searched the entire b. rapa genome sequence for genes containing the myb domain using the pfam program with the myb dbd model  as a query. we identified more than  <dig> sequences containing myb or myb-like repeats . firstly,  <dig> golgi-associated retrograde protein  were excluded  <cit> ; consequently, based on the identification numbers and chromosome locations, any redundant sequences were removed from the dataset. to verify the reliability of our results, we also performed smart analysis to identify all of the putative myb protein sequences in the chinese cabbage genome. the results were consistent with the pfam outcome. finally,  <dig> myb-related,  <dig> typical r2r3-myb   and  <dig> r1r2r3-myb  proteins were successfully identified in chinese cabbage. six atypical myb proteins were also identified, including four 4r-like proteins and two 5r-myb proteins  <cit> . the resulting sequences were named according to the standard constructed by stracke  <cit> , and the corresponding relationships between the names we defined and their genomic ids are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  our analysis revealed that the r2r3-myb subfamily was the largest myb subgroup, comprising  <dig> % of chinese cabbage myb genes , which was consistent with previous studies in rice and arabidopsis  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
chromosomal distribution of myb transcription factor genes. the proportion of each class distributed among  <dig> chromosomes  and three subgenomes . we classified brmyb transcription factors into four distinct groups, namely myb-related, r2r3-myb, r1r2r3-myb, and atypical myb, based on the presence of one, two, three and more than three myb repeats, respectively.



wang et al. divided the chinese cabbage genome into three subgenomes according to their fractionation degree, namely the least fractionated , medium fractionated , and most fractionated  subgenomes, and the lf subgenome seemed to be fractionated later than the mf <dig> and mf <dig> subgenomes because that the earlier subgenomes evolutionally appeared, the more time they would have to proceed fractionation  <cit> . in our study, the lf subgenome had the highest number of myb genes , and atypical myb genes were distributed in all three subgenomes , indicating that atypical myb genes appeared before the mf subgenomes began to fractionate. in total, myb genes represented approximately  <dig> % of the  <dig>  predicted chinese cabbage protein-coding loci. we also counted myb genes in plants ranging from algae to higher plants, except p. trichocarpa  <cit> , g. max  <cit> , a. thaliana  <cit> , v. vinifera  <cit> , z. mays  <cit>  and o. sativa  <cit>  that had published myb information, while there were few genome-wide studies of mybs in other selected plants, thus myb numbers in these plants were obtained through the strategy used in chinese cabbage myb identification in this study ; among these species, land plants seemed to carry far more myb genes than algae, indicating that a huge expansion of myb family members occurred after the evolution of land plants. the r2r3-myb family is the most abundant transcription factor family in most plants, with  <dig> members in arabidopsis  <cit> ,  <dig> in rice  <cit> , and  <dig> in grape  <cit> . moreover, species-specific members of this subgroup of the myb gene superfamily have been identified.figure  <dig>

to investigate the homologous domain sequence features, we performed multiple alignment analysis using the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> homologous domain amino acid sequences of r2r <dig> repeats from arabidopsis, chinese cabbage and rice, respectively . the basic regions of the myb domains had around  <dig> amino acid residues, with rare deletions or insertions as previously reported  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the distribution of amino acid residues at the corresponding positions of the r <dig> and r <dig> myb repeats of each species. generally speaking, the distribution of conserved amino acids among the myb domains of chinese cabbage was very similar to those of arabidopsis and rice, suggesting evolutionary conservation of mybs among plants. they all included highly conserved triplet tryptophan  residues in each dbd repeat, and the characteristic w residues were located at positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of the r <dig> repeat  and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the r <dig> repeat in chinese cabbage ; similar localization was observed in both arabidopsis and rice . conserved w residues have also been found in myb-related and 3r-myb genes , indicating the indispensable role of these residues in maintaining the helix-turn-helix structure of myb domains  <cit> . in the r <dig> repeat, the first tryptophan  residue was generally replaced by phenylalanine . however, the second and the third tryptophan residues were apparent and showed high conservation. in each repeat, the major conserved residues in the myb domain were mainly distributed at the second and third conserved trp residues, suggesting that the first part of each repeat in the myb domain was apparently less conserved  <cit> . this was mainly because helix- <dig> is highly conserved in chinese cabbage for its dna recognition and direct contact functions. in addition to the highly conserved w residues, more than 90% of alternative residues were highly conserved in the chinese cabbage r2r3-myb domains, including e- <dig>  d- <dig>  l- <dig> and g- <dig> in r <dig> repeats and g- <dig>  e- <dig>  g- <dig>  g- <dig>  n- <dig> and r- <dig> in r <dig> repeats . however, the myb domains in both repeats of the r2r3-myb genes in chinese cabbage and rice seemed to be larger than that in arabidopsis ones; this was inferred from the space between neighboring w residues. an analogous phenomenon also existed in other types of myb domains . the largest insertions in myb domains were observed in rice, while the size varied only slightly between arabidopsis and chinese cabbage.figure  <dig>

chromosomal distribution and collinearity analysis of duplicated r2r3-brmyb genes
genome chromosomal location analysis revealed that the chinese cabbage mybs were distributed on all  <dig> chromosomes and all three subgenomes . in total,  <dig> brmybs  were separately mapped onto chromosomes a01–a <dig>  except for three members  on the scaffolds. on average, one r2r3-myb gene was present every  <dig>  mb relative to the whole genome. relatively high densities of brmybs were observed in some chromosomal regions, including the top and bottom of chromosomes a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig>  and the bottom of chromosomes a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig>  in contrast, almost all central chromosome regions lacked r2r3-mybs. among the  <dig> chromosomes, chromosome a <dig> contained the most r2r3-myb genes, while chromosome a <dig> possessed the least  . furthermore, the  <dig> brmyb genes were also mapped onto the chromosomes in relation to the three subgenomes , including  <dig> in lf,  <dig> in mf <dig>  and  <dig> in mf <dig> . therefore, the  <dig> putative r2r <dig> proteins , could be divided into three groups accordingly. however, 3r-myb and atypical myb genes were seemingly not present on all chromosomes in chinese cabbage; furthermore, chromosomes a <dig> and a <dig> only had myb-related and r2r3-myb genes .figure  <dig>

it has been confirmed that gene duplication occurred during the process of plant evolution, thereby contributing to the establishment of new gene functions  <cit> . the emergence of multigene families is attributed to gene duplication via region-specific duplication or genome-wide polyploidization. mcscanx was used to further analyze the collinear relationships of the r2r3-mybs in chinese cabbage  <cit> . it had been well addressed that a genome duplication event in chinese cabbage occurred approximately 5– <dig> million years ago  and resulted in a highly duplicated genome  <cit> . the collinear relationships of the duplicated pairs in the r2r3-myb gene family in chinese cabbage are shown in figure  <dig>  in total, we identified  <dig> pairs  of highly similar paralogs that shared a high degree of identity through their protein sequences . at least eight brmybs were located in duplicated segments on each chromosome. interestingly, all of the r2r3-myb genes in subgenome lf had one or more duplicates in the other subgenomes, suggesting that all r2r3-myb genes were retained in the genomic triplication of chinese cabbage; this might also have contributed to the expansion of r2r3-myb gene family.figure  <dig>

it is likely that after duplication, a series of synonymous and/or non-synonymous mutations in their orfs generated new functions for the brmybs during evolution. therefore, we calculated the synonymous  and nonsynonymous substitutions  per site between duplicated gene pairs to estimate the selection types and divergence timing. the calculation results for the  <dig> duplicated pairs are listed in table  <dig>  all duplicated r2r3-myb gene pairs had a ka/ks ratio <  <dig>  representing purifying selection . all of the duplicated genes were found to be segmentally duplicated according to the classify method constructed previously  <cit> , which are located on duplicated segments on  <dig> chromosomes and  <dig> subgenomes in chinese cabbage. among them, r2r3-myb genes containing subgenome lf have one or more duplicated genes in other subgenomes, suggesting that all the brmyb genes have been retained in chinese cabbage after genome triplications. in previous reports, estimations of cruciferous plant evolutionary timescales were based on the synonymous substitution rate  <cit> . the divergence times of the duplicated r2r3-mybs were also calculated as described in the “methods”. the divergence time ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>   million years . this indicated that the duplication events for most r2r3-mybs in chinese cabbage occurred after the genome triplication event   <cit> . their duplication seemed to be inconsistent with the whole-genome duplication, it might be caused by the genome partly deletion, and the lacking degree of the three subgenomes were distinct, which further leaded to the delay of the calculated divergence times. in contrast, the divergence times of brmyb3r11-brmyb3r <dig>  brmyb177-brmyb <dig>  brmyb59-brmyb <dig>  brmyb39-brmyb <dig>  brmyb169-brmyb <dig>  brmyb169-brmyb <dig>  brmyb222-brmyb <dig> and brmyb3-brmyb <dig> were earlier than the triplication event.

phylogenetic analysis and conserved motif identification of the r2r3-myb family in chinese cabbage
to evaluate the evolutionary relationships within the r2r3-myb gene family, we performed a combined phylogenetic analysis of arabidopsis and chinese cabbage r2r3-myb proteins  to obtain a maximum likelihood  tree using mega  <dig> . because of the large number of taxa and relatively low support values for informative characters, we used nj analysis to support our subgroup designations . the tree topologies derived from the ml and nj analyses were basically identical, which indicated that the two methods were in strong agreement. five sequences did not belong to any of the subfamilies . the sequence similarity and phylogenetic tree topology allowed us to divide the genes into  <dig> subfamilies, which ranged in size from  <dig> to  <dig> mybs . in our subfamily classification of myb genes, we also referred to the classification model of arabidopsis r2r3-myb genes constructed by stracke et al. and dubos et al.  <cit> . in arabidopsis,  <dig> of the  <dig> r2r3-mybs had been divided into  <dig> subfamilies , so we labeled the previously defined clades in the trees shown in figure 6a and additional file 4: figure s <dig> to compare our results with these studies. most of the large subgroups  were supported by previous studies while some small ones  were not. the unequal distribution of r2r3-mybs between chinese cabbage and arabidopsis further supported the existence of the b. rapa whole genome triplication event . in most subgroups defined in our ml tree, there were more r2r3-mybs in chinese cabbage than arabidopsis; by contrast, the c <dig> subgroup included an equal number of mybs from arabidopsis and chinese cabbage. these findings indicated that the r2r3-mybs in chinese cabbage experienced duplications after the divergence of chinese cabbage and arabidopsis. notably, subgroups c <dig> and c <dig> contained  <dig> and  <dig> r2r3-brmybs but no r2r3-atmybs, which suggested that the members of these subfamilies might have specialized roles that were either lost in arabidopsis or acquired in the chinese cabbage lineage after divergence from the last common ancestor with arabidopsis . to determine whether this arabidopsis ortholog gene loss phenomenon was unique to dicots or also extended to monocots, we constructed a ml phylogenetic tree of r2r3-mybs from arabidopsis, chinese cabbage and rice . the tree topology showed there were also ancestral duplication and gene loss events in rice r2r3-mybs. taking previous studies on poplar into consideration  <cit> , we suggest that the ancestral duplication of r2r3-myb genes might extend to various types of land plant species.figure  <dig>

genes from the same subfamily sharing the same motifs are likely to share similar functions  <cit> . since our classification was based on the arabidopsis model, which was grouped according to the functions of the atmybs, we could further explore the common motifs and potential functions of each r2r3-brmyb group. using meme, we searched for conserved motifs outside of the myb domains of each group. thirty-one of the  <dig> classified subfamilies shared one or more motifs outside of the myb domains, which provided further support for the subfamily definitions. we identified  <dig> conserved motifs in the c-terminal regions and two motifs located before the myb domains , ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. this was consistent with previous hypothesis that mybs with similar protein structures were clustered into the same conserved subfamily  <cit> . most of these conserved motifs were novel, but some had been characterized with different functions  <cit> . for instance, motif  <dig>  which was conserved in c <dig> members, was characterized as involved in apoptotic signaling and has spt <dig> protein-binding characteristics according to smart analysis. these results suggest that these genes probably participate in cell death processes regulated by spt5-mediated transcriptional elongation  <cit> . in many plants, r2r3-myb , bhlh and wd-repeat proteins regulate the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . the companions of atmyb <dig> in c <dig> contained motif  <dig>  which is known to participate in wd-repeat interactions. in arabidopsis, atmybcdc <dig>  is distantly related to typical r2r3-myb proteins  <cit> . atmybcdc <dig> contains an r3-repeat in its myb domain that shows low homology to typical r3-repeats in r2r3-mybs , and a very long c-terminal region. in chinese cabbage, four genes  were highly homologous to atmybcdc <dig> . a meme search identified a conserved  <dig> amino acid motif in the c-terminal region of this subfamily  that might interact with histone deacetylase  proteins, raising the possibility that these subfamily members might be involved in hdac-mediated transcription inhibition  <cit> .table  <dig>

expression profiling of r2r3-myb genes in chinese cabbage
previously developed rna-seq web-based tools, including tissue-specific gene expression data, allowed us to analyze the transcriptome in chinese cabbage  <cit> . then, different transcript patterns were identified for the  <dig> r2r3-myb genes  using brad data, and gene expression levels were calculated in rpkm units . consequently, we obtained expression information for each subfamily and compared the expression profiles of myb transcription factor subfamilies of chinese cabbage in different tissues . we subsequently summarized these expression profiles against the phylogenic tree .

as with many genes encoding transcription factors, many of the r2r3-brmyb genes had low transcript levels according to the rna-seq analysis. however, different transcript abundance patterns were identified in the rna-seq dataset for the r2r3-brmyb genes. the rpkm values of the r2r3-myb genes are shown in additional file 8: table s <dig>  among the  <dig> genes,  <dig> were expressed in at least one tissue, while the remaining  <dig> members either had no expression or their expression profiles could not be found in the rna-seq database. nearly  <dig> of the  <dig> genes  were expressed at relatively low levels in all three tissues. for example, the expression of  <dig> r2r3-brmybs  in the roots,  <dig>  in the stem, and  <dig>  in the leaves was downregulated . however,  <dig>  r2r3-mybs showed high transcript levels in all three tissues, indicating that they might be indispensable in maintaining normal growth and metabolic processes of chinese cabbage. in contrast,  <dig>  of the  <dig> genes had marked peaks in transcript levels in only one tissue, including  <dig> in the roots,  <dig> in the stem and  <dig> in the leaves, which suggests that these r2r3-brmyb proteins act as regulators limited to discrete tissues or organs. for instance,  <dig> of the r2r3-brmyb members with the most abundant expression in roots encode proteins in subfamily c <dig> . the c <dig>  subfamily containing arabidopsis mybs  has been reported to function in the regulation of root development and axillary meristems  <cit> . this suggests that r2r3-brmyb members of this subfamily that are expressed in chinese cabbage roots may have a similar role in determining root architecture. brmyb <dig> had the highest transcript abundance in leaves, and its homologous gene atmyb <dig> has been shown to regulate cuticle formation in trichomes and induce over-accumulation of waxy substances on leaves  <cit> ; thus, we could deduce from the peak expression of brmyb <dig> in leaves that it probably be involved in waxy substance formation to protect the leaves of chinese cabbage. in addition, some of the r2r3-brmybs exhibited tissue-specific expression. for example, consistent with its arabidopsis homolog atmyb <dig>  brmyb <dig> was only expressed in the root, indicating a role in rhizobacteria-induced systemic resistance such as atmyb <dig> performs in arabidopsis roots  <cit> . however, in contrast with the expression profile of atmyb <dig>  which was shown to function in seed size regulation  <cit> , its chinese cabbage homolog brmyb <dig> was only expressed in the stem. overall, although the functions of most r2r3-brmyb genes are unknown, our phylogenetic and expression profiling analyses provide a foundation for further research on r2r3-brmyb gene functions.

r2r3-brmybs involved in abiotic stresses and signal transduction
r2r3-myb proteins that have been characterized mainly participate in plant-specific processes, such as primary and secondary metabolism, cell identity, developmental regulation and stress responses  <cit> . in nature, plants suffer various biotic and abiotic stresses throughout their growth and development. some r2r3-mybs, such as atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> are involved in responses to these stresses  <cit> . we selected forty-three r2r3-brmybs that had relatively remarkable expression in the expression profiles above for qpcr analysis of their responses to abiotic stresses  and signaling hormones , to explore whether these brmyb genes had significant performance in response to exogenous stressors. the overall expression trends of these selected genes in response to cold stress were similar under osmotic stress, and more than half of the selected r2r3-brmyb genes were differentially expressed under at least one stressor  . most of the r2r3-brmyb genes up-regulated by cold or osmotic stress reached their peak expression at about 12 h after treatment, indicating that their stress response might be rapidly regulated. by contrast, some selected genes such as brmyb <dig>  brmyb <dig>  and brmyb <dig> were continuously expressed  under different abiotic stresses. brmyb <dig>  brmyb <dig>  brmyb <dig>  brmyb <dig> and brmyb <dig> were significantly upregulated by both cold and osmotic stress treatments respectively , suggesting that they have roles in abiotic stress responses, much like their arabidopsis orthologs. similarly, the c <dig> subfamily members  were also up-regulated by both stresses . previous studies have revealed that plant myb3r factors participate in the transcriptional control of cyclins, especially in late g <dig> and m phase, and osmyb3r- <dig> regulates a cyclin involved in the cbf pathway to increase tolerance to low temperatures and drought  <cit> . our results were consistent with these findings, and indicate that the 3r-myb factors of chinese cabbage are probably involved in stress response regulation, and that some homologous genes  may be functionally redundant in these processes. however, brmyb <dig>  had no response to cold treatment, but was induced drastically by osmotic stress. since atmyb <dig> was identified as a regulator of glucosinolate biosynthesis  <cit> , a process involved in leaf water balance in broccoli  <cit> , our findings strengthen the suggestion that myb <dig> homologs may be novel regulators in the plant water deficit response.figure  <dig>

genes under abiotic stress and hormone treatments. four-leaf-stage chinese cabbage plants were given various treatments, including  cold,  osmotic stress,  aba and  auxin, under a continuous time course . qpcr data were normalized using brgapdh. results are the means ± standard deviation  of three independent experiments.



the plant hormones aba and auxin control important cellular processes, including seed germination, leaf senescence, stomatal aperture and stress responses  <cit> . the qpcr results showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> r2r3-myb genes were up-regulated under aba treatment, most of which showed similar patterns to their arabidopsis orthologs, suggesting that they function in the same processes  <cit> . for instance, arabidopsis s <dig> subgroup members myb <dig> and myb <dig> act through the aba signaling pathway to regulate stomatal movement and disease resistance  <cit> ; likewise, the c <dig>  members brmyb <dig> and brmyb <dig> had relatively high transcript levels in response to exogenous aba, suggesting their roles in the aba signaling cascade. moreover, most of the  <dig> genes responded to auxin treatment. among them, brmyb <dig>  brmyb <dig>  brmyb <dig>  brmyb <dig>  brmyb <dig> and brmyb <dig> were up-regulated by aba but down-regulated by auxin, suggesting that these r2r3-brmyb genes might act as regulators in aba-auxin antagonistic regulation of senescence processes  <cit> . in addition, atmyb <dig> was shown to regulate lateral root meristem activation via aba-auxin signaling crosstalk  <cit> . notably, brmyb <dig>  was down-regulated by auxin treatment in leaves; thus, we hypothesize that chinese cabbage myb96-homologous genes may also participate in aba-auxin signaling crosstalk in the aerial parts of chinese cabbage.

CONCLUSIONS
in total,  <dig>  r2r3-myb tfs were identified in the whole chinese cabbage genome, most of which were localized on the  <dig> chromosomes and three subgenomes. duplicated gene pairs among the r2r3-brmyb genes were detected by syntenic analysis, which supports the genome triplication event in chinese cabbage. phylogenetic analysis of the r2r3-myb family in chinese cabbage and arabidopsis revealed the conserved organization of this family, which further indicates that r2r3-myb family members from various plants underwent gene duplication events with a common origin and were retained over a long period by each genome. additionally, the increased number of r2r3-mybs that seemingly evolved independently in chinese cabbage and rice may contribute to plant viability under adverse conditions and functional specialization of r2r3-myb genes. in addition, the tissue-specific expression profiles of the r2r3-myb genes suggest that some of them have important roles in developmental and metabolic processes. moreover, qpcr analysis indicated that several genes might function in stress responses and aba-auxin hormone signal-mediated morphogenesis and cell senescence, which further highlights the functional diversity and indispensability of the r2r3-myb genes in the normal growth and development of chinese cabbage. this study gives an overview of the r2r3-myb genes in chinese cabbage and enabled us to provide some insights into plant stress response mechanisms and how transcription factors act in complex signal transduction, but how r2r3-brmyb genes participate in these processes will require further investigation.
