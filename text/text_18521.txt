BACKGROUND
although increasing evidence suggests that intestinal flora is involved in the pathogenesis of ibd, to date no specific bacterial pathogen has been identified as the cause of this disease. the role of mycobacteria in the etiology of ibd has been a contentious subject for many years. the possible association between m. avium paratuberculosis and cd in humans was first suggested nearly  <dig> years ago because johne's disease  and cd have similar histological and pathological features with affected tissues containing granulomas  <cit> . interest in a causal association between jd and cd was stimulated in the 1980s after m. avium paratuberculosis was isolated from material taken from patients with cd  <cit> ; subsequent studies confirmed these results  <cit> . this premise is further supported by successful cd treatment with anti-mycobacterials containing macrolide antibiotics  <cit>  and from the sero-reactivity of the cd patient serum samples against m. avium paratuberculosis  <cit> . recently, we reported that humoral and cellular responses during spontaneous colitis in il-10-/- mice are driven in part by conserved ags in mycobacterium species  <cit> . together, these studies form a wide body of evidence that supports the potential role for mycobacteria in cd. however, an incomplete understanding of the cellular mechanisms responsible for the pathology of colitis makes this conclusion uncertain.

there is a consensus that the mucosa of cd patients is dominated by th <dig> cell producing inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . cxcr <dig> interactions with cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> are important for the selective homing of th <dig> effectors cells  <cit> , which mediate mucosal immunity, inflammation, and colitis  <cit> . il-10-/- mice develop spontaneous colitis that has similarities to human cd at ~ <dig> months of age under conventional housing conditions which can be abrogated by anti-cxcl <dig> ab treatment. the present study explores the cxcr <dig> axis and cellular mechanisms that drive mycobacteria-associated colitis in il-10-/- mice. we also report that serum from both cd and uc patients contain significantly higher mycobacteria-specific igg <dig> and igg <dig> ab responses as well as cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and saa levels than compared to normal healthy donors. these innate and adaptive immune responses coincide with mycobacteria-specific humoral and cellular responses and modulation of mesenteric lymph node , peyer's patch  and lamina propria  th1-associated cytokines and cxcr <dig> ligands expressed by dcs, t cells, neutrophils and nk/nkt cell subsets following mycobacteria challenge of otherwise specific pathogen-free mice.

methods
immunogens
m. avium paratuberculosis strain ben , a clinical isolate from a cd patient, was obtained from the american type culture collection . bacteria were cultured in middlebrook 7h <dig> broth supplemented with 10% adc  and  <dig> μg/ml mycobactin j  to an od <dig> of  <dig>  and frozen. the viable titer of these stocks was determined by thawing replicates, serial dilution in culture medium and plating on middlebrook 7h <dig> agar supplemented with  <dig> μg/ml of mycobactin j. for detection of mycobacteria-specific responses, m. avium paratuberculosis bacilli were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde.

sera collection
sera from  <dig> cd and  <dig> uc female patients and  <dig> normal healthy female donors were collected by clinomics biosciences, inc. the ages of the patients were  <dig> to  <dig> years. diagnoses were based on clinical, radiological, endoscopic, and histological criteria. these patients did not receive any steroid treatment before blood was drawn. all subjects gave written informed consent and the study was approved by the clinomics biosciences research ethics committee, . subsequently, the university of louisville institutional review board  approved the use of these diagnostic specimens in accordance with the department of health and human service policy for the protection of human research subjects  <dig> cfr  <dig>   <dig> and use of archived de-identified materials.

mycobacterium-specific ab detection by elisa
mycobacteria-specific igg ab responses in the serum of human patients were measured by elisa, according to manufacturer's protocol . briefly, 96-well falcon elisa plates  were coated with  <dig> μl of  <dig> μg/ml of heat-killed and paraformaldehyde-fixed m. avium paratuberculosis in coating buffer  or serially diluted human igg <dig>  igg <dig>  igg <dig>  and igg <dig> isotype controls overnight at 4°c and blocked with  <dig> μl of 10% fbs  in pbs  for  <dig> hours at room temperature. individual samples were added and serially diluted in fbs-pbs. after  <dig> hours incubation at room temperature, the plates were washed , and the concentrations of igg subclass abs were determined by the addition  <dig> μl of biotin-conjugated mouse anti-human γ <dig> , γ <dig> , γ <dig> , and γ <dig>  heavy-chain-specific monoclonal abs. after the incubation and washing steps,  <dig> μl of  <dig>  μg/ml horse radish peroxidase -conjugated anti-biotin ab  in fbs-pbs was added to igg subclass ab detection wells, and the plates were incubated for  <dig> hours at room temperature. following incubation, the plates were washed  <dig> times and developed by adding  <dig> μl of abts solution and read at  <dig> nm. the mycobacterium-specific elisa assays were capable of detecting  <dig> pg/ml for human igg subclass samples.

chemokine analysis by elisa
serum concentrations of human cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> were determined by elisa , according to the manufacturer's instructions. in brief, 96-well elisa plates were coated with capture abs, and the plates were incubated overnight at room temperature. after blocking,  <dig> μl of sample or standards were added to each well, and the plates were incubated for  <dig> hours at room temperature. then,  <dig> μl of detection abs solution was added to each well, and the plates were further incubated for  <dig> hours at room temperature. after washing the plates,  <dig> μl of streptavidin-hrp solution was added, and the plates were incubated for  <dig> min in the dark. next,  <dig> μl of substrate solution was added to the plates, which were incubated for an additional  <dig> min at room temperature in the dark. finally,  <dig> μl of the stop solution was added, and the plates were read at an optical density of  <dig> nm after  <dig> min using λ corrections of  <dig> and  <dig> nm. the elisa assays were capable of detecting > <dig> pg/ml of each chemokine.

saa elisa
saa levels were determined by elisa kit . in brief,  <dig> μl of saa-specific mab solution was used to coat micro-titer strips to capture saa. serum samples and standards were added to wells and incubated for  <dig> hr at rt. after washing in the assay buffer, the hrp-conjugated anti-saa mab solution was added, and the plates were incubated for  <dig> hr at 37°c. after washing,  <dig> μl tetra-methyl-benzidine  substrate solution was added, and the reaction was stopped after incubation for  <dig> minute at rt. after the addition of stop solution, the plates were read at an optical density of  <dig> nm.

animals and m. avium paratuberculosis challenge
female  <dig> to  <dig> weeks old il-10-/- mice, on b <dig> background, were purchased from jackson laboratories  and used to establish a colony at the morehouse school of medicine animal facility. the animals were housed and maintained in isolator cages under specific-pathogen-free housing conditions. the guidelines proposed by the committee for the care of laboratory animal resources commission of life sciences-national research council were followed to minimize animal pain and distress. to determine the cellular responses enhanced by mycobacteria, groups of naïve il-10-/- mice received  <dig> μl of  <dig> cfu live or heat-killed  m. avium paratuberculosis in cream milk or cream milk alone  by oral gavage. mice were sacrificed by co <dig> inhalation  <dig> weeks post inoculation. each experimental group consisted of  <dig> to  <dig> mice.

cell isolation
spleens and mln from individual mice were mechanically dissociated, and red blood cells were lysed with ack lysis buffer ,  <dig> weeks after challenge. single cell suspensions of the spleens and mln were passed through a sterile wire screen . cell suspensions were washed twice in rpmi  <dig> and stored on ice in complete medium containing 10% fbs until use. cells from the lp and pp were isolated as described previously  <cit> . after removal, pp were kept on ice-cold rpmi containing 2% fbs. intestines were cut into  <dig> cm stripes and stirred in pbs containing  <dig> mm edta at 37°c for  <dig> min. in brief, the intestinal lp was isolated by digesting intestinal tissue in collagenase type iv  in rpmi  <dig> , for  <dig> min with stirring at 37°c. after each 45-minute interval, the released cells were centrifuged and stored in complete medium, and remaining mucosal pieces were replaced with fresh collagenase solution. lp lymphocytes were further purified using a discontinuous percoll  gradient, collecting between the 40/75% percoll interface. leukocytes were maintained in a complete medium, which consisted of rpmi  <dig> supplemented with  <dig> ml/l of nonessential amino acids ,  <dig> mm sodium pyruvate ,  <dig> mm hepes ,  <dig> u/ml penicillin,  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin,  <dig> μg/ml gentamycin ,  <dig> μm mercaptoethanol , and 10% fbs .

flow cytometry analysis
leukocytes from the spleen, mln, pp, and lp were isolated as described above and stained to measure ex vivo expression of chemokines and cytokines,  <dig> weeks after challenge. cells were first treated with fc block  for  <dig> min at 4°c, washed with staining buffer, and then stained with cy-, fitc- or pe-conjugated anti-cd <dig> , -cd <dig> , -cd <dig> , -cd11b , -cd11c , and -nk <dig>    for  <dig> min with shaking. the cells were washed  <dig> times with staining buffer and resuspended with bd cytofix/cytoperm  solution for  <dig> min each. the cells were again washed  <dig> times in bd perm/wash solution at 4°c for  <dig> min each. the fixed, permeabilized cells were then resuspended in a pre-determined apc-conjugated anti-cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  tnf-α, ifn-γ, or cxcr <dig> ab for  <dig> min at 4°c in the dark. lymphocytes were then washed with facs staining buffer  and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry .

histology
intestinal tissues were preserved using streck™ fixative  and embedded in paraffin. fixed tissues were sectioned at  <dig> μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for microscopic examination. intestinal lesions were multi-focal and of variable severity. the grades given to intestinal sections that took into account the number of lesions as well as their severity. a score  was given, based on the criteria described previously  <cit> . the summation of these scores provided a total colonic disease score per mouse. the disease score could range from  <dig> to a maximum of  <dig> .

statistics
the data expressed as the mean ± sem and compared using a two-tailed paired student's t-test or an unpaired mann whitney u-test. the results were analyzed using the statview ii statistical program  and microsoft excel  for macintosh computers. single-factor and two-factor variance anova analyses were used to evaluate groups and subgroups, respectively. hence, results were considered statistically significant if p values were <  <dig> .

RESULTS
changes in igg subclass ab profile in ibd patients
previously, we have shown that serum mycobacteria-specific igg2a ab responses were higher in il-10-/- mice with spontaneous colitis, than compared to control mice  <cit> . this previously described imbalance of the th <dig> > th <dig> cytokine levels as well as humoral response  suggested that a th1-biased host response is associated with the progression of colitis. to further test this hypothesis in human subjects, we measured levels of mycobacteria-specific igg subclass abs in the sera of ibd patients and healthy donors. while total igg <dig>  igg <dig>  igg <dig>  and igg <dig> subclass abs were significantly higher in the sera of ibd patients compared to healthy donors , the profile of the igg humoral response in ibd patients also revealed increases in mycobacteria-specific igg <dig> and igg <dig> abs . these responses in cd patients were significantly higher than in uc patients or normal healthy donors. cxcr <dig> ligands were also increased in these samples than compared to healthy donors. these results suggest that ibd patients have higher cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  and cxcl <dig> levels and mycobacteria-specific igg <dig> and igg <dig> ab responses. these findings correlate well with our previous findings showing higher levels of mycobacteria-specific igg2a and cxcr <dig> ligands during spontaneous colitis in il-10-/- mice under conventional housing  <cit> .

characteristics of colitis progression
we also measured the saa levels of ibd patients and healthy donors; cd patients displayed significantly higher saa levels compared to other groups, which correlated with the higher mycobacteria-specific igg2a levels described above. colitis progression in il-10-/- mice closely corresponds with increased saa levels  and with reduction in body weight, compared with the initial body weight  <cit> . the results of the present study show that mice challenged with live mycobacteria in otherwise specific pathogen-free conditions experienced a significant rise in saa levels when compared to similar mice challenged with heat-killed mycobacteria or control mice . despite the significant increase in saa and more pronounced reduction in body mass, both live and heat-killed mycobateria challenged il-10-/- mice developed histologically similar colitis than compared to controls, as illustrated by significantly higher colitis disease scores . the intestinal tissues of mice challenged with mycobacteria showed higher increases in leukocyte infiltrates, which consisted of lymphocytes and occasionally polymorphonuclear cells as well as a higher frequency of lymphoid follicles in live versus heat-killed mycobacteria-challenged groups . in short, colitis was more aggressive in mice that received live mycobacteria, as noted by multi-focal lesions and aggregates of leukocyte infiltrates in the large intestines, than compared to control mice.

the severity of colitis was monitored by evaluating the histopathological changes in colons of il-10-/- mice on b <dig> background that received  <dig> μl of cream milk or  <dig> cfu of live or heat-killed m. avium paratuberculosis in cream milk. following the sacrifice of mice  <dig> weeks later, colons were fixed, sectioned at  <dig> μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. the sections were microscopically examined and scored for the severity of colitis. the data presented are the mean ± sem colitis score. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences, i.e., p <  <dig>  between experimental and the control group.

cxcr <dig>  cxcl <dig>  ifn-γ, and/or tnf-α expression by cd4+ and cd8+ t cells
to address the leukocyte subsets responsible for colitis progression, we assessed the ex vivo expression of chemokines and cytokines by mln-, pp-, and lp-derived cell subsets in il-10-/- mice challenged with live or heat-killed m. avium paratuberculosis bacilli. the numbers of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells from mln, pp, and lp lymphocytes that expressed cxcr <dig>  ifn-γ, and tnf-α from mice challenged with live bacilli were significantly higher than similar mice challenged with heat-killed bacilli or the control group. dramatic increases in the number of pp cxcl11+ t cells, pp and lp cxcr3+ t cells and pp tnf-α+ t cells as well as mln tnf-α+ cd8+ t cell subsets were observed in mice challenged with live bacilli than compared to other groups . pp, mln, and lp ifn-γ+ cd4+ t cells as well as mln and lp ifn-γ+ cd8+ t cells were significantly elevated after livemycobacterial challenge. these results imply that intestinal inflammation is driven in part by effector site-derived  cxcr3+ tnf-α+ cd4+ and cd8+ t cells along with similar cells from pp that produce cxcr <dig> ligands as well as mln  ifn-γ+ t cells to presumably support th1-biased colitis.

alteration of dc cytokine and cxcr <dig> ligands expression following mycobacteria challenge
to further address the adaptive versus innate leukocyte subsets responsible for mycobacteria-enhanced colitis in il-10-/- mice, we next assessed myeloid and plasmacytoid dc phenotypes from mln, pp, and lp after disease onset. pp and mln dcs expressed elevated levels of cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig>  but not cxcl <dig>  during mycobacteria-enhanced colitis as indicated by their relative mean fluorescent intensities . interestingly, both dc subsets heterogeneously expressed cxcl <dig>  the number of pp cxcr3+ dcs was significantly higher in live mycobacteria-challenged mice than in other groups . however, the number of mln cxcr3+ plasmacytoid dcs was significantly higher in mycobacterial-challenged mice than in other groups of mice. the numbers of mln and lp dcs subsets expressing cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> after the onset of colitis were significantly increased during live mycobacteria-enhanced colitis than in the other groups with the exception of mln cxcl10+ myeloid dcs that were elevated following live bacterial challenge. while the dcs subsets studied did not appear to significantly express tnf-α, there were significantly more numbers of mln and pp cd8α+ dcs and only pp-derived cd8α- dcs that expressed ifn-γ from mice with live mycobacteria-enhanced colitis, than compared to other groups. lp plasmacytoid dcs from mice receiving live bacteria were also increasingly il-12p40+, than compared to other groups.

cxcr <dig>  ifn-γ, tnf-α, il- <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> expression by nk and nkt cells during mycobacteria-enhanced colitis
nk cells act as regulators of cd4+ t cell-driven colitis  <cit> . while neither nk nor nkt cell subsets largely expressed cxcr <dig>  there were substantially more cxcl10+ nk cells in the mln, pp, and lp during mycobacteria-enhanced colitis, than compared to other groups . il-12p <dig> expression and the number of nk cell subsets were elevated in mice challenged with live mycobacteria than compared to mice challenged with heat-killed mycobacteria or control mice. whereas, greater numbers of ifn-γ+ nk and nkt cells were confined to the mln and lp in live mycobacteria-challenged group than compared to other groups. in contrast, we noticed a modest decrease in the number of pp cxcr3+, ifn-γ+, cxcl9+ and cxcl11+ nk cells during live mycobacteria-enhanced colitis. these results suggest that together nk and nkt cells express cxcl <dig>  il-12p <dig>  tnf-α and ifn-γ to recruit and activate cxcr3+ leukocytes to inductive and effector sites during mycobacteria-enhanced colitis.

th1-associated cytokines, cxcr <dig> and cxcr <dig> ligands expressed by neutrophils
neutrophils are among the first cells to arrive at sites of inflammation and infection. these cells also have the capacity to release cxcl <dig>  <cit>  and are present during mycobacteria-enhanced colitis. lp neutrophils significantly expressed tnf-α, in a heterogenous fashion, following live mycobacterial challenge . tnf-α+ neutrophils were largely retained in the lp during disease when compared to other groups. mln and lp, but not pp or spleen, contained higher numbers of tnf-α+ and ifn-γ+ neutrophils during mycobacteria-enhanced colitis . in contrast, higher numbers of il-12p40+ and cxcl10+ ly6g+ cells were found in pp and spleen, but not in mln of lp from live mycobacteria-challenged mice relative to control mice and heat-killed mycobacteria-challenged mice. however, greater numbers of cxcl9+ and cxcl11+ neutrophils were found in mlns of live bacteria-challenged mice, than compared to other groups. these data suggest that neutrophils are compartmentalized and tightly regulated to differentially express cxcr <dig> ligands, cxcr <dig> and th1-promoting cytokines during mycobacteria-driven colitis.

discussion
although there is no recognized or agreed on infectious agent for ibd, interest in m. avium paratuberculosis as a possible causative began due to similar signs and symptoms of jd and cd. for example, chronic granulomatous and intramural inflammation is common in both cd and jd; however, the precise pathophysiologic mechanisms sustaining inflammation in these diseases are imprecisely known. in confirmation with others  <cit> , we show an increase in mycobacteria-specific igg <dig> and igg <dig> abs in sera from patients with active cd or uc. while the cellular mechanism and response mediating mycobacteria-enhanced ibd have not been entirely demonstrated, recently we showed that colitis in il-10-/- mice was driven in part by 85b ag-specific cd4+ t cell responses  <cit> . as m. avium paratuberculosis is a mycobactin auxotroph and is not known to replicate outside a host, spontaneous colitis of il-10-/- mice upon transfer to conventional housing is possibly the result of exposure to mycobacterium species, which are commonly found in soil and water. we illustrate several cellular mechanisms that may drive mycobacteria-enhanced colitis in il-10-/- mice. mycobacteria-challenged il-10-/- mice housed under otherwise pathogen-free conditions develop colitis that is driven by cxcr3- and corresponding ligand-expressing leukocytes, which underscores another important hallmark or molecule mechanism of colitis.

the expression of cxcr <dig> and its ligands  by mucosal t cells significantly increased in mice challenged with live mycobacteria than compared with similar mice challenged with heat-killed mycobacteria or controls. our results also suggest plasmacytoid > > myeloid dcs express cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig>  but less cxcl <dig> as well as ifn-γ to recruit, differentiate, and expand th <dig> cells to mediate colitis. nk cell and neutrophil subsets were compartmentalized in mucosal inductive and/or effector site to further foster adaptive th <dig> responses through ifn-γ and il-12p <dig> production as well as tnf-α expression during colitis. relatively high levels of serum tnf-α and ifn-γ as well as ag-specific th <dig> responses were also noted in this model  <cit> . these findings suggest an association between mycobacteria and cd patients as well as il-10-/- murine colitis.

it is well established that il- <dig> drives th <dig> differentiation and subsequent ifn-γ production  <cit> . we demonstrate that local and/or systemic expression of the tnf-α, ifn-γ, and cxcr <dig> ligands are increased during live mycobacteria-enhanced colitis. tnf-α is a proinflammatory cytokine produced by leukocytes at local sites of inflammation  <cit> . this cytokine is also important for the activation of granulocytes and fibroblasts during cd  <cit> . lp lymphocytes produce significant amounts of tnf-α in ibd tissues and secretary fluids  <cit> . perhaps the production of cxcr <dig> ligands along with ifn-γ and tnf-α during colitis progression creates a situation in which th <dig> cells are recruited, activated, further differentiated, and expanded to initiate or maintain disease. while tnf-α produced by cd4+ t cells is neither sufficient nor required for the induction of murine colitis, its production by ag-presenting cells is essential for the histopathological and clinical signs of colitis  <cit> . we show that nk cell subsets and neutrophils, compared to t cells, expressed the greatest levels of tnf-α during mycobacteria-mediated colitis, which is also a hallmark of spontaneous murine colitis.

the presence of cxcl <dig> is considered an important signal for selective homing and/or activation of effector cells, which preferentially accumulate at inflammatory sites  <cit> . previously, we showed cxcl <dig> enhanced cd <dig> and cd <dig> expression by ag-activated cd4+ t cells  <cit>  and dc activation  <cit> . plasmacytoid dcs have an inherent capacity to produce large amounts of ifn-γ and dc activation is a critical step and is reported to be higher in cd patients  <cit> . intestinal lp dcs prime t cells and home to mln for further activation and clonal expansion of t cells  <cit> . dcs can be found in the intestinal mucosal  <cit>  and have also been shown to produce and respond to cxcr <dig> ligands  <cit> . in the present study, we show that cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> are predominantly produced by dcs in the mln as well as in pp and to a lesser degree in the intestinal lp. the selective expression of cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> by plasmacytoid and myeloid dcs suggests a differential role for these cells in the attraction of specific lymphocyte subsets  <cit>  as well as in the preferential recruitment and activation of th <dig> cells  <cit> . in a recent study, mature dc-derived cxcr <dig> ligands were shown to be essential in th <dig> cell retention in draining lymph nodes and to optimize th1-mediated immune responses  <cit> .

nk cells have been shown to be involved in the differentiation of naïve cd4+ t cells into th <dig> cells  <cit> . the current study suggests nk and nkt cells collaborate to produce cxcl <dig>  il-12p <dig>  tnf-α, and ifn-γ to recruit and stimulate cxcr3+ leukocytes in either inductive or effector sites during colitis. in ibd, neutrophil activation, migration, and degranulation are important effector mechanisms of intestinal damage  <cit> . it has been reported that human neutrophils have the capacity to release cxcl <dig>  <cit> . in the present study, changes in the number of neutrophils that expressed cxcr <dig>  ifn-γ, cxcl <dig>  and cxcl <dig> in the mln, il-12p <dig> and cxcl <dig> in pp as well as ifn-γ and tnf-α in lp of mice during mycobacteria-enhanced colitis suggest that neutrophil subsets are differentially compartmentalized and regulated to propagate colitis.

activation of toll-like receptors  leads to the induction of antimicrobial pathways central to innate defense as well as upregulation of ag presentation molecules and secretion of cytokines that influence the nature of the subsequent adaptive immune response. to this end, tlr signal transduction requires myd <dig>  <cit> ; myd88-/- mice are highly susceptible to infection by m. tuberculosis and colitis  <cit> . tlr-activated dcs generally favor th <dig> responses due in large part to the production of il- <dig>  <cit> . mycobacteria cell constituents have long been recognized as powerful immunologic adjuvants. it is plausible that mycobacteria stimulate tlrs to promote colitis in il-10-/- mice, which presents a scenario where mycobacterial recognition via tlr and myd <dig> activate dcs to control th <dig> polarization and expansion.

live orally administered m. avium paratuberculosis do not readily colonize or extensively replicate in the murine host. the ability of this bacterial species to colonize and replicate in man is also questionable. in fact, b <dig> mice are only modestly susceptible to orally administered m. avium paratuberculosis  <cit> . granulomatous lesions containing acid-fast bacteria develop in mesenteric lymph nodes  <dig> months after oral challenge using  <dig> cfu. in this study,  <dig> cfu of live m. avium paratuberculosis initiated the development of colitis, but there was no evidence of infection by histology  or bacterial culture  <cit> . presumably, il- <dig> deficiency or a host that elicits th1-biased immune responses to microbial challenge supports the development of colitis with either undetectable or no growth of m. avium paratuberculosis.

we speculate that innate  and adaptive  immunity antigens are better presented by live m. avium paratuberculosis or recognized by the th1-biased host to modulate relevant cellular and molecular mechanisms required by colitis development. indeed, persistent presentation of flora present in conventional housing is required for colitis in il-10-/- b <dig> mice. hence, heat-killed mycobacteria may not have allowed for this sustained presentation and expression in the host. additional studies using antibiotics along with or without live or heat-killed bacteria  will be necessary to reveal the precise requirements for mycobacteria-induced colitis.

CONCLUSIONS
we can conclude that ibd patients have higher cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  and cxcl <dig> levels and mycobacteria-specific igg <dig> and igg <dig> ab responses. these findings correlate with our previous findings that show higher levels of mycobacteria-specific igg2a and cxcr <dig> ligands occur during spontaneous colitis in il-10-/- mice  <cit> . in short, colitis was more aggressive in il-10-/- mice that received live mycobacteria, than compared to similar mice that received heat-killed bacilli or vehicle, housed under specific pathogen-free housing. it can be surmised that il-12p40+ tnf-α+ ifn-γ+ nk and nkt cells express cxcl <dig> to recruit and activate cxcr3+ leukocytes to inductive and effector sites during mycobacteria-enhanced colitis . as with these innate immunity cells, neutrophils are compartmentalized in the mln and tightly regulated to differentially express cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig>  cxcr <dig> and th1-associated cytokines during mycobacteria-mediated colitis. these results further show that murine colitis is driven in part by effector site-derived cxcr3+ tnf-α+ cd4+ and cd8+ t cells as well as inductive site ifn-γ+ t cells to support th1-biased colitis. this response is enhanced or maintained by high numbers of mln and pp cd8α+ ifn-γ+ dcs, pp-derived cd8α- ifn-γ+ dcs, and il-12p40+ lp plasmacytoid dcs. while additional studies will be required to ascertain the precise role of mycobacteria in the induction and progression of colitis, we report that live mycobacterial challenge accelerates chronic colitis in il-10-/- mice.
