BACKGROUND
during their life time, plants always suffer from invasion of potential pathogenic microorganisms in the environment. to defend themselves against pathogen attack, plants have evolved a sophisticated immune system  <cit> . two types of innate immune responses, which are precisely regulated upon infection from different types of pathogens, have been recognized in plants so far. the first innate immune response is the pathogen-associated molecular pattern -triggered immunity , which is activated by a number of pamps such as flagellin, ef-tu and chitin  <cit> . the other one is the effector-triggered immunity , which is modulated by recognition of pathogen-derived avirulence effectors by plant r proteins  <cit> . once initiation of the innate immune responses, plant cells can often trigger a series of signaling events that lead to diverse cellular responses including changes in ion fluxes, synthesis of the defense-related hormones, transcriptional reprogramming, production of reactive oxygen species , and a localized form of programmed cell death  referred to as the hypersensitive response   <cit> . these signals are translated from outside into plant cells by some conserved signal molecules and trigger plant downstream immune responses  <cit> .

mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascades are highly conserved signaling modules downstream of receptors/sensors that transduce extracellular stimuli into intracellular responses  <cit> . the mapk cascade comprises three functional protein kinases, i.e. mapk kinase kinases , mapk kinases  and mapks. upon perception of the environmental signals by the membrane-localized receptor-like protein kinases, mapkkks activate via phosphorylation their downstream mapkks, which in turn further phosphorylate mapks  <cit> . the input signal can be amplified through the mapk cascade to modify a set of specific downstream target proteins by the way of phosphorylation  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana,  <dig> mapkkks,  <dig> mapkks and  <dig> mapks have been recognized  <cit>  and some of them have been studied extensively for their functions in plant immunity. two entire arabidopsis mapk cascades, mekk1-mkk4/mkk5-mpk3/mpk <dig> and mekk1-mkk1/2-mpk <dig>  have been established through genetic and biochemical studies and have been shown to act as positive or negative regulators of signaling pathways involved in immune responses such as pti and eti  <cit> . the components of the mekk1-mkk4/mkk5-mpk3/mpk <dig> cascade can be activated rapidly upon treatment with some of pamps such as flg <dig>  a peptide pamp derived from bacterial flagellin  <cit> . knockout/knockdown of individual component in this mapk cascade normally results in increased disease susceptibility to a range of pathogens including pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc <dig> and botrytis cinerea <cit> , whereas transient or stable expression of constitutively active phosphomimic mkk4/mkk <dig> in arabidopsis leaves or transgenic plants leads to enhanced resistance to bacterial and fungal pathogens and activated defense responses including expression of defense genes, generation of ros, accumulation of camalexin and appearance of hr-like cell death  <cit> . by contrast, the mekk1-mkk1/2-mpk <dig> cascade plays both positive and negative roles in regulating plant defense. the mekk <dig>  mkk1/mkk <dig> double and mpk <dig> plants exhibit constitutively activated defense responses, i.e. accumulation of ros, elevated level of salicylic acid  expression of defense genes and hr, and display enhanced resistance to a range of pathogens  <cit> . genetic, molecular and biochemical studies have also identified a number of components of the mapk cascades from other plants such as tobacco and rice, which play important roles in regulating disease resistance responses against different types of pathogens  have been shown to function as positive regulators of pto-mediated signal transduction  <cit> . recently, it was found that a tomato 14-3- <dig> protein tft <dig> can interact with both slmapkkkα and slmkk <dig> and may coordinately recruit slmapkkkα and slmkk <dig> for efficient signaling leading to pcd  <cit> .

despite of extensive studies on the mapk cascades in immune response in tomato, little is known about the functions of these mapk cascades in defense response against necrotrophic fungal pathogens such as b. cinerea. in the present study, we performed functional analyses using virus-induced gene silencing  approach of slmkks in resistance against b. cinerea and found that both slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> act as positive regulators of defense response against this necrotrophic fungal pathogen.

RESULTS
identification of tomato slmkks
four slmkks, slmkk1- <dig>  have previously been identified from tomato through searching expressed sequence tags in the tigr tomato gene index using the ntmek <dig> amino acid sequence as a query  <cit> . in searches against the tomato genome sequence database , we identified one more putative slmkks and named as slmkk <dig>  which is predicted to locus solyc03g <dig>  no full-length cdna was identified in the tomato genome sequence database but an expressed sequence tag  was obtained in genbank database, indicating that the slmmk <dig> gene is normally expressed in tomato plants. this is further supported by our cloning and sequencing of the coding sequence of slmkk <dig>  which encodes a protein of  <dig> aa, larger than those of slmkk1- <dig> . phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that slmkk <dig>  belonging to group b of plant mkks  <cit> , is much close to arabidopsis atmkk <dig> and tobacco ntnpk <dig>  showing 76-93% of identity at amino acid level and also shows 26-37% of identity to other arabidopsis mkks . therefore, it is likely that there are five slmkks in tomato genome and each of tomato slmkks falls into one group of plant mkks identified so far.

expression of slmkks induced by b. cinerea infection and phytohormone treatment
to explore the possible involvement of slmkks in defense response against b. cinerea, we first analyzed the expression changes of slmkks after infection with b. cinerea. as shown in figure  <dig>  all five slmkks were induced upon infection of b. cinerea but showed different expression dynamic patterns. generally, as compared with those in the mock-inoculated plants, the expression of slmkk1- <dig> was induced significantly with peaks at 12 hr and thereafter declined during 24–48 hr after infection with b. cinerea . specifically, the expressions of slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> in b. cinerea-infected plants showed approximately  <dig> and  <dig> folds of increases over those in the mock-inoculated plants at 12 hr after inoculation . the expressions of slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> exhibited 3– <dig> folds of increases at 12 hr after infection of b. cinerea. however, unlike the expression dynamics of slmkk1- <dig>  the expression of slmkk <dig> was not induced significantly during the early stage of infection but showed an increase after 24 hr, showing  <dig> folds of increases . these results indicate that the tomato slmkks respond to infection of b. cinerea with different dynamics and magnitude of expression and that slmmk <dig> and slmkk <dig> have stronger induction of expression upon b. cinerea infection.

we further examined the dynamics of slmkks expressions in tomato plants after treatment with sa, methyl jasmonate  and 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid  . as shown in figure  <dig>  different dynamics of expression patterns for slmkks were observed in response to these defense signaling hormones. in sa-treated plants, expression of slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> was significantly increased by 2– <dig> folds over that in the control plants, while expressions of slmkk <dig>  slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> were not affected markedly by sa . in meja- or acc-treated plants, expression of slmkk <dig> was strongly induced by both meja and acc, reaching 3– <dig> folds of increased at 6 hr after treatment . slmkk <dig> was also induced by meja and acc, its expression level showed an increase of  <dig> folds at 6 hr after acc treatment and exhibited an increase of  <dig>  folds at 12 hr after meja treatment . however, the expressions of slmkk <dig>  slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> were not affected by meja and acc during our experimental period. therefore, it is clear that the tomato slmkks also respond with different expression patterns to sa, ja and et, three well-known defense signaling hormones.

silencing of slmkk2/slmkk <dig> resulted in reduced resistance to b. cinerea
to examine the possible involvement of slmkks in disease resistance against b. cinerea, we performed functional analyses on all five slmkks identified by vigs approach through comparing the phenotype of disease caused by b. cinerea between individual slmkk-silenced plants with control plants. for this purpose, specific fragment for each slmkk gene was chosen to generate vigs construct and standard vigs procedure with a phytoene desaturase  construct as an indicative for vigs efficiency of each experiment was performed on 2-week-old plants  <cit> . only when >90% of the pds construct-infiltrated plants showed bleaching phenotype, the vigs construct of interest gene-infiltrated plants were used for experiments. the silencing efficiency and specificity for each slmkk gene was determined by qrt-pcr analyzing the transcript level of the target slmkk gene and other four slmkk genes in the trv-target slmkk-infiltrated plants. in our experiment condition, when compared with those in the trv-gus-infiltrated plants, the transcript level of the target slmkk gene was significantly reduced whereas the transcript levels of the other slmkk genes were comparable in the trv-target slmkk-silenced plants . overall, the silencing efficiency for a target slmkk gene was approximately 70-75% . therefore, the silencing efficiencies and specificity for each slmkk gene were satisfied for further experiments.

to investigate the roles of slmkks in disease resistance against b. cinerea, we used two different strategies, detached leaf disease assays for fast evaluation and whole plant disease assays for confirmation, to compare the disease phenotype and in planta fungal growth in the trv-target slmkk-infiltrated plants with those in the trv-gus-infiltrated plants. in detached leaf disease assays, typical disease lesions were observed 2 days post inoculation  . the lesions on leaves from the trv-slmkk2- or trv-slmkk4-infiltrated plants were larger than that in the trv-gus-infiltrated plants at  <dig> dpi and began to merge into large necrotic areas at  <dig> dpi , showing an approximately 40% of increase in lesion size over those on leaves from the trv-gus-infiltrated control plants . the lesions on leaves from the trv-slmkk1-, trv-slmkk3- and trv-slmkk5-infiltrated plants were similar to that in the trv-gus-infiltrated plants . further whole plant disease assays were carried out to confirm the disease phenotype observed in the trv-slmkk2- and trv-slmkk4-infiltrated plants. in the whole plant disease assays, the trv-slmkk2- and trv-slmkk4-infiltrated plants along with the trv-gus-infiltrated plants were inoculated by spraying with spore suspension of b. cinerea and disease phenotype and in planta fungal growth were observed and analyzed, respectively. as shown in figure 5a, the trv-gus-infiltrated control plants displayed slight disease, whereas the trv-slmkk2- or trv-slmkk4-infiltrated plants showed severe diseases, showing large necrotic areas and maceration or wilting of full leaves at  <dig> dpi. analysis of the transcript for the b. cinerea actin gene bcactina as an indicator of the rate of fungal growth in planta further confirmed that the trv-slmkk2- and trv-slmkk4-infiltrated plants showed reduced resistance to botrytis infection than the trv-gus-infiltrated control plants . growth of b. cinerea in leaf tissues of the trv-slmkk2- or trv-slmkk4-infiltrated plants had three times higher than those in the trv-gus-infiltrated control plants at  <dig> and 48 hr after inoculation , indicating much fungal growth in the slmkk2- or slmkk4-silenced plants. these data demonstrate that knockdown of the slmkk <dig> or slmkk <dig> resulted in reduced resistance to b. cinerea and thus both slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> are required for resistance against b. cinerea.

silencing of slmkk2/slmkk <dig> attenuated defense response against b. cinerea
to elucidate the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in the reduced resistance in the slmkk2- or slmkk4-silenced plants, we analyzed and compared the accumulation of ros such as h2o <dig> and expression of defense genes before and after infection with b. cinerea between the slmkk2- or slmkk4-silenced plants and the control plants. ros has been demonstrated to play important roles in susceptible response of plants to infection from necrotrophic fungal pathogens, e.g. b. cinerea, especially the ros accumulated during late stage of infection, which directly benefits the growth of the invaded fungus  <cit> . no difference in accumulation of h2o <dig>  as detected by dab staining, was observed in leaves of the trv-slmkk2-, trv-slmkk4- and trv-gus-infiltrated plants without infection of b. cinerea , indicating that silencing of slmkk <dig> or slmkk <dig> itself did not affect the generation and accumulation of h2o <dig> in tomato plants. after infection with b. cinerea, significant accumulation of h2o <dig>  shown as brown precipitates in leaves, was detected in leaves of the trv-slmkk2-, trv-slmkk4- and trv-gus-infiltrated plants . however, the leaves from the trv-slmkk2- and trv-slmkk4-infiltrated plants showed consistent increase in intensity of the stained areas as compared with the trv-gus-infiltrated plants after infection of b. cinerea . these data indicate that silencing of slmkk <dig> or slmkk <dig> accelerates the generation and accumulation of h2o <dig> upon infection of b. cinerea.

we next analyzed the expression of representative marker genes regulated by the ja/et- and sa-mediated defense signaling pathways, respectively, to explore the possible molecular mechanism associated with the reduced b. cinerea resistance in slmkk2- and slmkk4-silenced plants. for this purpose, two marker genes, slprp <dig> and slpr1b, regulated by the sa-mediated signaling pathway  <cit> , and another three marker genes, sllapa, slpi i and slpi ii, regulated by the ja/et-mediated signaling pathway  <cit> , were chosen to compare their expression changes in the trv-slmkk2- or trv-slmkk4-infiltrated plants with those in the trv-gus-infiltrated plants. no significant difference in expression of the four defense genes examined was observed in the trv-slmkk2-, trv-slmkk4- or trv-gus-infiltrated plants without infection of b. cinerea , indicating that silencing of slmkk <dig> or slmkk <dig> did not affect the expression of defense genes in tomato plants under normal healthy condition. as compared with those in the mock-inoculated plants, the expression levels of slprp <dig> and slpr1b increased significantly after infection with b. cinerea; however, the expression levels in the trv-slmkk2- and trv-slmkk4-infiltrated plants were reduced to some extents as compared with those in the trv-gus-infiltrated plants . similarly, infection of b. cinerea also induced significantly the expression of sllapa, slpi i and slpi ii ; however, the expression levels of sllapa, slpi i and slpi ii in the trv-slmkk2- and trv-slmkk4-infiltrated plants were significantly reduced, showing >90% of reduction, as compared with those in the trv-gus-infiltrated control plants, at 24 hr after infection of b. cinerea . these results indicate that silencing of slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> attenuates significantly the expression of both sa signaling- and ja/et signaling-regulated defense genes in tomato plants upon infection of b. cinerea.

transient expression of slmkk2/slmkk <dig> in nicotiana benthamiana activated defense responses against b. cinerea
to further confirm the function of slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> in resistance to b. cinerea, we examined whether overexpression of slmkk <dig> or slmkk <dig> can confer an increased resistance to b. cinerea. in our initial experiments, we were unable to observe typical hr when transiently expressed the wild types of slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> genes in nicotiana benthamiana leaves . this differed from previous observations that transient expression of slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> in tomato and n. benthamiana leaves resulted in hr production  <cit> . considering that slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> are components of the mapk cascades that require protein phosphorylation for their biochemical functions, we thus generated constitutively active phosphomimicking forms of slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig>  slmkk2dd and slmkk4dd, by replacing the conserved ser/thr residues in the activation loop xxxxx) with asp  <cit> . when transiently expressed in n. benthamiana leaves, high levels of slmkk2dd and slmkk4dd expression and the slmkk2dd-gfp and slmkk4dd-gfp fusion proteins were detected . transient expression of either slmkk2dd or slmkk4dd resulted in a typical and strong hr and significant accumulation of h2o <dig> in the infiltrated areas of n. benthamiana leaves 48 hr after infiltration , indicating that an activated phosphorylation status of slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> is necessary for their biochemical functions. we infiltrated the slmkk2dd and slmkk4dd constructs into one side of the n. benthamiana leaves for transient expression and then inoculated the opposite side of the leaves with spore suspension of b. cinerea 48 hr after infiltration. in our experiments, tissues collapse due to strong hr was always observed in the slmkk2dd- and slmkk4dd-infiltrated halves of the leaves . in disease assays, the lesions on the opposite halves of the leaves from the slmkk2dd- and slmkk4dd-infiltrated n. benthamiana plants were significantly smaller than that in egfp vector-infiltrated control plants , leading to approximately 40% of reduction in lesion size, at 5 days after inoculation with b. cinerea . to examine whether the enhanced disease responses induced by transient expression of slmkk2dd and slmkk4dd were linked to change in the regulation of defense genes. we also analyzed and compared the expression of some selected defense genes in leaves of the egfp vector-, slmkk2dd- and slmkk4dd-infiltrated plants. as shown in figure 8c, the expression levels of pr <dig>  pr <dig>  pr <dig> and pr <dig> in the slmkk2dd- and slmkk4dd-infiltrated plants were significantly increased at 24 h after infiltration, showing 10– <dig> folds of increases over those in the egfp vector-infiltrated plants . these data demonstrate that phosphorylated slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> positively regulate defense response against b. cinerea and that phosphorylation of slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> is required for their functions in plant immunity.

discussion
the mapk cascades, as an important module that mediates the transduction and amplification of the environmental signals from plasma membrane-localized receptors/sensors into plant cells, play critical roles in defense responses against pathogen attack . regarding a large body of evidence on the functions and mechanisms of the mapk cascades in plant innate immune responses  against biotrophic/hemibiotrophic pathogens, the function of the mapk cascades in defense response against necrotrophic fungal pathogens, which have distinct infection styles from that of biotrophic pathogens  <cit> , is relatively limited. when searched in the literatures, only a few of studies have examined phenotypically using loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches the functions of individual component of mapk cascades, i.e. atmpk <dig>  atmpk <dig> and atmkk <dig>  in resistance to necrotrophic fungi such as b. cinerea and alternaria brassicicola <cit> . we previously demonstrated that the tomato slmpk <dig>  a homolog of atmpk <dig>  is required for resistance to b. cinerea <cit> . in the present study, we showed that two tomato mkks, slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig>  are also required for resistance to b. cinerea and function as positive regulators of defense response against b. cinerea. our findings provide new insights into the understanding of the molecular mechanism for the mapk cascades in regulating tomato immune response against necrotrophic fungal pathogens.

four slmkks were previously identified  <cit> . in the present study, we identified the fifth slmkk, slmkk <dig>  which belongs to group b of plant mkks  <cit>  and seems to be a close homologue of arabidopsis atmkk <dig> . our identification of slmkk <dig> led to a total of five members for the tomato mkk family, which fall into different groups of plant mkks  <cit> . surprisingly, the number of the slmkk family is obviously lesser than those in other plant species such as arabidopsis   <cit> , rice   <cit> , soybean   <cit> ; popular   <cit> ; apple   <cit> , canola   <cit>  and brachypodium distachyon   <cit> . for instance, two close homologues of mkk <dig> exist in arabidopsis and rice genomes . however, only one mkk <dig> was found in three nicotiana species   <cit>  and in tomato . relatively fewer members of the slmkk families in tomato and probably in other solanaceae plants may be due to species-specific diversification during evolutionary history. on the other hand, the smaller number of the slmkk family in tomato also suggests that the tomato slmkk proteins may have evolved to play pleiotropic roles in diverse biological processes.

activity of the mapk cascades can be regulated at both transcriptional level and post-translational level. transcriptional regulation of expression of genes for mkks was reported in a range of plants upon different biotic and abiotic stress. for instance, the arabidopsis atmkk <dig>  cotton ghmkk <dig> and ghmkk <dig> and n. attenuata namkk <dig> were recently shown to be induced by different pathogens , defense signaling molecules  and herbivores  <cit> . similarly, we also found in this study that the five tomato slmkk genes are responsive to b. cinerea and that slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> can be induced rapidly and strongly after infection of b. cinerea . the inducibility of the expressions of slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> by sa, ja and acc  indicates that these two slmkks may be involved in both the sa- and ja/et-mediated signaling pathways that activate defense responses against different types of pathogens. the significance of the transcriptional regulation of mkks is also supported by several observations that overexpression of wild type forms of the mkk genes in transgenic plants or increased expression in activation-tagged mutant plants can result in altered resistance against a range of pathogens  <cit> . however, biochemical activation of the mapk cascades at the post-translation level, which involves phosphorylation by upstream signals, is critical to their functions as signaling modules. to this regard, further biochemical experiments are required to examine whether slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> and their involved mapk cascades are activated in tomato plants upon infection of b. cinerea.

in our vigs-based phenotyping of all five slmkks, no any altered response of the slmkk1-, slmkk3- or slmkk5-silenced plants to b. cinerea was observed . the arabidopsis atmkk <dig>  a closely related homolog of slmkk <dig> , has been shown to function as a negative regulator of immune response against biotrophic/hemibiotrophic pathogens  <cit>  and overexpression of constitutively active form atmkk2ee resulted in enhanced susceptibility to a. brassicicola <cit> . atmkk <dig> has a redundant function with atmkk <dig> and both atmkk <dig> and atmkk <dig> act upstream of atmpk <dig> in the mekk1-mkk1/2-mpk <dig> cascade  <cit> . silencing of slmpk <dig>  a homolog of atmpk <dig>  resulted in reduced resistance to b. cinerea <cit> . surprisingly, silencing of slmkk <dig>  a possible mkk that acts upstream of slmpk <dig>  did not affect resistance to b. cinerea . the arabidopsis atmkk <dig>  closely related to slmkk <dig> , has been demonstrated to participate in a partial mapk cascade that plays an important role in regulating expression of a set of ja-responsive genes, which are involved in ja-mediated defense responses  <cit> . however, in our study, silencing of slmkk <dig> also did not affect the resistance to b. cinerea , similar to a previous observation that silencing of slmkk <dig> did not affect resistance to xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, the causal agent of bacterial spot disease on tomato  <cit> . the phylogenetically related members of the slmkk <dig> from other plants have not been functionally analyzed for their biological functions, but the rice osmek <dig> and maize zmmek <dig>  closely related to slmkk <dig>   <cit>  were shown to be involved in primary roots and abiotic stress response  <cit> . thus, it is possible that slmkk <dig> may not be involved in disease resistance to b. cinerea . regarding to the slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig>  however, their involvement in resistance to b. cinerea and to other pathogens cannot be ruled out before the disease phenotypes in plants with overexpression of the constitutively active phosphomimicking forms of slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> are carefully examined.

the function of slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> in resistance to b. cinerea is supported by several observations presented in this study. firstly, silencing of slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> resulted in reduced resistance to b. cinerea, as shown in detached leaf disease assays and whole plant disease assays . slmkk <dig> is closely related to arabidopsis atmkk <dig> and atmkk <dig> . the reduced resistance to b. cinerea in the slmkk2-silenced plants is somewhat similar to the observation that the arabidopsis mpk <dig> plants showed reduced basal resistance to b. cinerea <cit> , although there is no direct experimental evidence indicating whether mutations in atmkk <dig> and atmkk <dig>  two upstream mkks of atmpk <dig>  <cit> , affect basal resistance to b. cinerea. meanwhile, it was found that silencing of nbmkk <dig>  closely related to slmkk <dig> , attenuated resistance against a nonhost pathogen pseudomonas cichorii <cit> . previous studies have shown that silencing of slmkk <dig> resulted in reduced resistance against p. syringae pv. tomato and x. campestris pv. vesicatoria <cit> , indicating that slmkk <dig> also plays a role in disease resistance against other pathogens.

secondly, silencing of slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> attenuated defense responses, i.e. generation of ros and expression of defense genes , induced by infection of b. cinerea. in our study, silencing of slmkk <dig> or slmkk <dig> resulted in significant accumulation of ros after infection of b. cinerea , consistent with the increased disease severity . this is in agreement with a general hypothesis that ros accumulated during the late stage directly benefits the establishment of infection by b. cinerea <cit> . several studies have demonstrated that b. cinerea induces the generation of ros in plants to the benefit of the pathogen  <cit> . comparison of the kinetics of ros accumulation between the abscisic acid-deficient sitiens tomato mutant plants  and the susceptible wild type plants after infection with b. cinerea revealed that timing of ros accumulation is critical to its role in disease development  <cit> . h2o <dig> accumulation in wild-type tomato plants started at 24 hr while h2o <dig> accumulation in sitiens plants was observed as early as 4 hr after inoculation  <cit> . in our study, significant accumulation of h2o <dig> at relatively late stage  in the slmkk2- and slmkk4-silenced plants may start to initiate cell death in the site of infection and thus facilitate growth and infection of b. cinerea. this is partially supported by the significant difference of fungal growth in the trv-slmkk2- and trv-slmkk4-infiltrated plants and the trv-gus-infiltrated plants at 24 hr after inoculation . therefore, ros accumulation in b. cinerea-infected tissues of plants may contribute differentially to disease development and disease resistance response depending on the timing kinetics of ros production and accumulation as a facilitator of cell death may promote susceptibility, but early ros may induce resistance mechanisms  <cit> . on the other hand, expression of slprp <dig> and slpr1b, regulated by the sa-mediated signaling pathway  <cit> , and sllapa, slpi i and slpi ii, regulated by the ja/et-mediated signaling pathway  <cit> , were significantly decreased in the slmkk2- and slmkk4-silenced plants after infection of b. cinerea , indicating that slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> may be involved in both sa - and ja/et-mediated signaling pathways in tomato plants upon infection of b. cinerea. this is partially supported by the observations that the arabidopsis atmpk <dig> and atmpk <dig>  downstream mapk of atmkk <dig> and atmkk <dig>  closely related to slmkk <dig> , are implicated in b. cinerea-induced et biosynthesis  <cit>  and that overexpression of atmkk <dig>  related to slmkk <dig> , leads to elevated levels of sa  <cit> .

thirdly, transient expression of the constitutively active phosphomimicking forms slmkk2dd and slmkk4dd in n. benthamiana plants led to hr-like cell death, overproduction of ros, enhanced resistance to b. cinerea and upregulated expression of defense genes . these phenotypes are consistent with the observations that transient expression of constitutively active forms of arabidopsis atmkk <dig> or tobacco ntmek <dig> resulted in pcd and enhanced resistance to b. cinerea <cit> . generally, hr-like cell death, probably caused by ros accumulated during the late infection stage, facilitates colonization of plants by b. cinerea <cit> . however, the coincidence of hr-like cell death and enhanced resistance against b. cinerea in n. benthamiana plants transiently expressed the constitutively active phosphomimicking forms slmkk2dd and slmkk4dd may indicate that not all hr-like cell death is correlated with susceptibility to necrotrophic fungal pathogens like b. cinerea. this hypothesis is supported by recent observations that the control of cell death governs the outcome of the sclerotinia sclerotiorum-plant interaction  <cit> . on the other hand, it was previously reported that expression of wild type forms of slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> in leaves of tomato and n. benthamiana plants caused typical pcd  <cit> . however, we failed to observe the appearance of pcd in leaves of n. benthamiana plants infiltrated with constructs of wild type of slmkk <dig> or slmkk <dig> . this is similar to the observation for atmkk <dig>  whose overexpression in its wild type form did not affect the resistance to p. syringae pv. tomato dc <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, when the slmkk2dd or slmkk4dd construct was transiently expressed in one half of leaves, the opposite half of the same leaves showed enhanced resistance to b. cinerea and upregulated expression of defense genes upon infection of b. cinerea , indicating that slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> may have a systemic effect on activation of defense response. it was recently found that ectopic expression of atmkk <dig> in local tissues could induce disease resistance in systemic tissues, demonstrating a critical role for atmkk <dig> in generating the systemic signal of sar  <cit> . in our experiments, significant h2o <dig> accumulation due to transient expression of slmkk2dd or slmkk4dd construct in one half of the n. benthamiana leaves at 48 hr after infiltration, at the time when the opposite half of the same leaves was inoculated with b. cinerea, may mount the ros generated during the early stage of infection. it is therefore possible that ros generated in the half leaf that transiently expressed the slmkk2dd or slmkk4dd construct may trigger the generation of yet unknown systemic signal, which transduce and activate defense responses in the opposite half leaf.

CONCLUSIONS
tomato genome encodes five slmkk genes and both of slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> can be induced by b. cinerea. silencing of slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> resulted in reduced resistance to b. cinerea, increased accumulation of ros and attenuated expression of defense genes after infection with b. cinerea in tomato. transient expression of the constitutively active phosphomimicking forms slmkk2dd and slmkk4dd in n. benthamiana plants led to enhanced resistance to b. cinerea and elevated expression of defense genes. our results demonstrated that both slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> function as positive regulators of defense response against b. cinerea in tomato.
