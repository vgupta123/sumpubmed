BACKGROUND
neuroblastoma  is the most common pediatric solid tumor. it arises from primitive sympathetic nervous cells and is characterized by clinical heterogeneity, including spontaneously regressing tumors, as well as aggressive malignant tumors. common chromosomal abnormalities include partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  in 30–35% of nb tumors, additional genetic material from the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  in more than 50%, amplification of the proto-oncogene mycn  and deletion of chromosome 11q and 14q  <cit> . whole-genome array-based approaches to analyse genomic rearrangements and chromosomal abnormalities have been employed for a variety of tumors, including nb tumors. initially, array comparative genomic hybridization  was used. different studies of nb have been conducted using bacterial artificial chromosome  arrays and custom-made cdna arrays  <cit> . based on these previous investigations, nb has been categorized into three major subtypes; types  <dig>  2a and 2b. subtype  <dig> comprises favorable nb with near triploidy and a predominance of numerical gains and losses, mostly representing non-metastatic nb stages  <dig>   <dig> and 4s. subtypes 2a and 2b are found in unfavorable widespread nb, stages  <dig> and  <dig>  with 11q loss and 17q gain without mycn amplification  or with mycn amplification often together with 1p deletions and 17q gain   <cit> . more recently commercially available high-density oligonucleotide based snp arrays have been employed in whole-genome copy number analyses of human tumors. they have provided accurate and rapid identification of genome abnormalities at high resolution. a few groups have used commercial oligonucleotide arrays to analyze nb tumors  <cit> . we present a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of dna copy number in  <dig> nb tumors using  <dig> k and/or  <dig> k gene chip arrays from affymetrix.

RESULTS
ninety-two nb tumors and four nb cell lines was analyzed with snp arrays from affymetrix. for a representative tumor, see figure  <dig>  figure 1a–c shows chromosomal rearrangements analyzed with the cnag <dig>  software.

regions with common hemizygous deletions
chromosome 1p deletion
loss of parts of the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  was found in 28/ <dig>  of the tumors; 52/ <dig>  presented with intact chromosome  <dig>  the other  <dig> tumors harbored other rearrangements, such as 1q gain. seventeen of the  <dig> tumors with deletions also had mycn amplification, whereas  <dig> did not . the tumors with mycn amplification generally had larger 1p deletions than tumors without mycn amplification . the five smallest deletions including the terminal of the short arm were found in tumors without amplification of the mycn gene , see figure 2a. the consensus loss in the tumors with mycn amplification was from position  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb and, in tumors without mycn amplification, from the terminal of 1p to  <dig>  mb.

loss of chromosome 11q
loss of the whole of chromosome  <dig> was detected in 15%  of the nb tumors. partial loss of 11q was found in 20/ <dig> , see figure 2b. loss of 11q was most commonly seen in tumors without mycn amplification; of the  <dig> tumors with 11q loss,  <dig> were not mycn amplified. the consensus loss in the two tumors with mycn amplification was  <dig>  mb , while it was  <dig> mb  in tumors without mycn amplification.

regions with homozygous and heterozygous deletions
deletions in chromosome 3p
in 9r <dig>  a stage  <dig> tumor, one homozygous deletion on the short arm of chromosome  <dig>   <dig> – <dig>  mb, was detected . this region contains exons 4– <dig> of the rbms <dig> gene; in a patient with unfavorable outcome. in addition,  <dig> of  <dig> tumors  with heterozygous deletions were detected;  <dig> stage  <dig> tumors, one stage  <dig> dead of disease  and the tumor mention above, see additional file  <dig>  two regions with overlap of deletions were identified among these  <dig> tumors. the shortest region of overlap, sro  <dig>  located at 0– <dig>  mb, was identified in  <dig> of the tumors and sro  <dig>  from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb, in  <dig> of the tumors. moreover, three cell lines had deletions of regions covering the rbms <dig> gene. sk-n-as and nb <dig> had large deletions, whereas kelly harbored four small deletions, one of which resided in rbms <dig>  kelly also had a homozygous deletion at region  <dig> – <dig> , covering the gene lsamp.

deletions in chromosome 9p
homozygous deletions were also detected in chromosome region 9p in four nb tumors. the shortest region of overlapping deletions, at  <dig>  mb, resided in the gene cdkn2a. four tumors with heterozygous deletions and one with a copy neutral loss of heterozygosity  were also detected, see figure 4a and 4c. the tumors with deletions were either high-stage nb or from patients with unfavorable outcome, see additional file  <dig>  the cell lines sk-n-as, nb <dig> and kelly also had heterozygous deletions in this region. in all cases, the homozygous or heterozygous losses in the cdkn2a/b region could be verified by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification , see figure 4b.

presence of copy-neutral loh
in the total set of genome profiles from the  <dig> tumors, only three cases of cn-loh could be detected;  the earlier mentioned case 18e <dig> concerning chromosome 9p ;  a case of partial 5q loss in 9r <dig> and  cn-loh of the entire chromosome  <dig> in 6r <dig> 

regions with amplification or gain
amplification on chromosome 2p
twenty-four of the  <dig> tumors  exhibited 2p amplification without gain and  <dig> tumors  had gains of parts of 2p without amplification, with 8/ <dig>  having both amplification and gain. two types of mycn-amplified tumor were identified. one type displayed simple amplicons, where a continuous region in and around mycn was amplified. the other type harbored more complex rearrangements, where several discontinuous amplification regions were included in the amplified fragment . apart from mycn, no other genes were found to be amplified in all cases with amplification .

amplification on chromosome 12
complex amplification on chromosome  <dig> was detected in two tumors, one of which also had mycn amplification. three different regions on chromosome  <dig> were amplified in both cases. region i contained the genes gli <dig>  os <dig> and cdk <dig>  among others, while mdm <dig> and yeats <dig> were two of the genes located in region ii; see figure  <dig> for more details.

gain of chromosome 17q
gain of chromosome 17q was observed in  <dig> of  <dig> cases . the region of gain always included the terminal of the q-arm, the smallest being  <dig>  mb , see figure  <dig> 

eighteen of the  <dig> nb tumors  showed only numerical rearrangements and 16/ <dig> tumors  had no structural or numerical rearrangements on any chromosome.

discussion
the used technique enabled high resolution detection and mapping of all numerical and structural genomic changes in the tumor material. we could also pinpoint several previously undetected rearrangements and map them in detail. these include five new cases of homozygous deletion, which is only infrequently reported in primary neuroblastoma tumors . the technique proved to be fast, robust, reproducible and reliable and it is likely to be a valuable tool in future studies of neuroblastoma tumors, both in research and in the clinical setting.

regions of deletions
thirty percent of the tumors had 1p deletion and those were significantly more often mycn amplified. tumors with mycn amplification had generally larger 1p deletions than tumors without mycn amplification and the five smallest deletions including the p-terminal were found in tumors without mycn amplification, which confirms an earlier study  <cit> . so, when identifying the sro in 1p deletions in nb, this will be delineated by the tumors without mycn amplification showing the most distal breakpoints. it is possible that different sets of 1p-deleted genes are important for the biological behavior of the mycn amplified and the non-mycn amplified cases, respectively. the sro of deletions in tumors without mycn amplification was located from  <dig> to  <dig>  mb. for the non-amplified tumors, an interstitial sro located between  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb  was defined. it has previously been reported that tumors with mycn amplification have 1p deletions extending proximal to 1p <dig> whereas non-amplified tumors more often have small terminal deletions of 1p <dig>  <cit> . many groups have previously tried to narrow down the shortest region of overlap of deletions on chromosome 1p  <cit> . in the largest study  <cit> , the smallest region of consistent deletion  in all but one nb tumor was located between  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb which resides inside our sro for tumors without mycn amplification.

there was a significant inverse correlation between 11q loss and the amplification of mycn. only  <dig> of the  <dig> tumors with a loss of chromosome  <dig> had mycn amplification. the smallest region on chromosome 11q that was lost was detected in the two tumors that also had mycn amplification , the smallest being  <dig>  mb, from  <dig>  mb to  <dig> /qter. the sro in the tumors without mycn amplification was defined as being  <dig> mb, from  <dig>  mb to  <dig> /qter. the fact that 11q deletions occurs predominantly in tumors without mycn amplification is in agreement with previous studies  <cit> .

homozygous deletions are rare events in primary nb tumors. only a few have been reported in single cases; the deletion or homozygous gene inactivation of nf <dig>  <cit> , the deletion of cdkn2a  <cit> , pten and dmbdt <dig>  <cit> . in addition, homozygous deletions in chromosome regions 1p <dig>  <cit> , 3p <dig>   <cit>  and 2q <dig>   <cit>  have been detected in nb cell lines. in our material, we detected homozygous deletions in the cdkn2a gene in chromosome 9p <dig> in four tumors. this region is frequently deleted in a wide range of malignancies  <cit> . cdkn2a encodes the transcripts p16ink4a and p14arf in alternative reading frames. p16ink4a is an inhibitor to the cell cycle activators cdk <dig> and cdk <dig>  which inactivate the tumor suppressor protein prb, and p14arf binds and inactivates mdm <dig>  which is responsible for the degradation of tp <dig>  thereby leading to the stabilization of tp <dig> . a second region of homozygous deletion was discovered in one nb tumor, located in chromosome region 3p <dig> , harboring the gene rbms <dig>  the protein encoded by this gene is a member of a protein family which binds single-stranded dna/rna. we also detected two homozygous deletions in the nb cell line kelly, one in chromosome 3p, covering the gene lsamp, and one in the gene ptprd in chromosome 9p. lsamp is a neuronal surface glycoprotein that has been identified as a putative tumor suppressor gene in ovarian and renal carcinomas  <cit> , also reported to be diminished in kelly and sk-n-as by stallings et al.  <cit> . ptprd is a candidate tumor suppressor gene that encodes a receptor type protein tyrosine phosphatase. this confirms the finding by stallings et al. who have previously reported that this gene is heterozygously deleted in some nb tumors and cell lines, as well as being homozygously deleted in kelly  <cit> . we identified two regions of sro on chromosome 3p in our material; sro  <dig> from 0– <dig>  mb and sro  <dig> from  <dig> – <dig> . our sro  <dig> region overlaps one of the three sros previously defined by hoebeeck et al  <cit> . this region contains among others rassf1a and zmynd10; two candidate tumor suppressor genes that are epigenetically silenced in a proportion of nb tumors  <cit> .

although differences in dosage between the different alleles is very common in nb tumors, given that several tumors are in the triploid range, it is noteworthy that in the present investigation, only three of the  <dig> analyzed nbs showed a cn-loh.

regions of gain and amplification
the most common chromosomal abnormality found in our material was the gain of chromosome 17q, found in 45% of the tumors. the sro of gains was located from  <dig>  mb to the terminal of the long arm, including the gene ppm1d located at  <dig>  mb. ppm1d has been reported to be the most likely target of the 17q <dig> gain in nb tumors  <cit> ; this gene was included in the gained region in all our tumors with 17q gain. recently, vandesompele and coworkers proposed that 17q gains may target two segments with one large from  <dig>  mb, in cases with a single region of gain, and one region of superimposed gains located more distally around  <dig> mb  <cit> .

the amplification of chromosome  <dig> was detected in two nb tumors. the gene mdm <dig> is located in the amplified region. the overexpression of mdm <dig> can result in the excessive inactivation of tp <dig>  thereby diminishing its tumor suppressor function. another gene is yeats <dig> , which has high expression in the human brain and is frequently amplified in gliomas  <cit> . genes in this region have also previously been found to be amplified in single nb tumor samples or cell lines  <cit> .

tp <dig> is inactivated by mutations in approximately half of all human tumors, and is believed to be abrogated in most tumors  <cit> , although tp <dig> mutations are rare in neuroblastoma tumors  <cit> . however, mechanisms other than tp <dig> mutations could prevent tp <dig> activation. previous studies have shown that silencing cdkn2a by methylation or the deletion or amplification of mdm <dig> are mechanisms that are responsible for inactivating tp <dig> in human tumors  <cit> . ppm1d has also been reported as a candidate proto-oncogene that may be involved in tumorigenesis through the inactivation of tp <dig>  <cit> . in our study, we detected homozygous and heterozygous deletions of cdkn2a and the amplification of mdm <dig> and copy number gain of ppm1d, which shows that these genes can be involved in the initiation/progression of neuroblastoma through the inactivation of tp <dig> 

the fact that 17% of the nb tumors presented with no rearrangements was probably due to the tumors not having any rearrangements that could be visualized with the arrays. however, the possibility that some of these tumor samples contained regions of normal stoma cells, in spite of our efforts to obtain pure tumor material for the studies, cannot be ruled out.

CONCLUSIONS
we have used oligonuceotide snp arrays from affymetrix to perform copy number analysis on chromosomal rearrangements in  <dig> primary nb tumors and four cell lines. the arrays, in combination with the cnag software for analyses and visualization, make the technique very useful for analyses of tumor tissue. the mapping arrays provide both copy number and allele-specific information and have the capacity to detect duplications, amplifications, homozygous and hemizygous deletions and copy neutral loh .

the most common structural abnormality in the tumors was the gain of 17q, which was identified in 45% of tumors, while 30% of the tumors harbored 1p deletion. two regions of 1p-sro deletions were identified, one larger for the tumors with mycn amplification  and one smaller for those without . most of the tumors with 1p deletion did also show mycn amplification. twenty-three percent of tumors had a loss of 11q; a feature most commonly seen in tumors without mycn amplification. the smallest 11q deletions were found in the few tumors with amplification of mycn . twenty-six percent of the nb had mycn amplification. two types of amplification were identified; one type displayed simple continuous amplicons, while the other type harbored more complex rearrangements. mycn was the only common gene in all cases with amplification. complex amplification on chromosome  <dig> was detected in two tumors and three different overlapping regions of amplification were identified. two regions with homozygous deletions were detected indicating genes with tumor suppressor features. four nb tumors had deletions in the cdkn2a gene region in 9p and one tumor had a deletion on 3p involving the rbms <dig> gene.
