BACKGROUND
protein-protein interactions perform and regulate fundamental cellular processes. the comprehensive study of such interactions on a genome-wide scale will lead to a clearer understanding of diverse cellular processes and of the molecular mechanisms of disease. although the determination of interactions by small-scale laboratory techniques is impractical for a complete proteome on the grounds of cost and time, several experimental techniques now exist to determine protein-protein interactions in a high-throughput manner  <cit> . high-throughput datasets have been generated for model organisms such as yeast  <cit> , worm  <cit>  and fly  <cit>  as well as escherichia coli  <cit> . in addition, the first broad-focus experimental datasets for the human interactome have recently been published  <cit> . interactions determined by high-throughput methods are generally considered to be less reliable than those obtained by low-throughput studies  <cit>  and as a consequence efforts are also underway to extract evidence for interactions from the literature  <cit> . analysis of the high-throughput datasets has shown that they overlap very little with each other, suggesting that their coverage is low. indeed, it has been estimated recently that the current yeast and human protein interaction maps are only 50% and 10% complete, respectively  <cit> .

the low coverage and variable quality of the experimental interaction datasets have prompted many groups to investigate computational methods to predict interactions or to determine the most likely interactions seen in the high-throughput datasets. the different approaches to predict interactions can be grouped into five main categories:

1) predictors based on sequence and structure exploit the observation that some pairs of sequence motifs, domains and structural families tend to interact preferentially. some methods predict interaction from sequence-motifs found to be over-represented in interacting protein pairs  <cit> , or by considering the physico-chemical properties and the location of groups of amino acids in the sequence  <cit> . others investigate the co-occurrence in interacting proteins of specific protein domains or their structural family classification  <cit> . when three-dimensional structures are available for both proteins thought to interact, high quality predictions and additional information such as the residues involved in the interaction and their binding affinity may be estimated . similarly, when two proteins show clear sequence similarity to proteins that exist in a complex for which the three-dimensional structure is known, detailed predictions of the atomic-level interactions may be made. for example, the major complexes in yeast have been predicted by this strategy  <cit> .

2) predictors based on comparative genomics have been exploited primarily in prokaryotes. they consider the physical location of genes, as well as their pattern of occurrence and evolutionary rate, to predict interactions or functional relationships between protein pairs. some predictors make use of the observation that neighboring genes whose relative location is conserved across several prokaryotic organisms are likely to interact  <cit> . other predictors exploit the observation that gene pairs that co-occur in related species or that co-evolve also tend to be more likely to interact  <cit> . in addition, domains that exist as separate proteins in some genomes but are also seen fused in a single protein in other genomes have been used to suggest the isolated domains may interact  <cit> .

3) predictors based on orthology work on the assumption that the orthologs of a protein pair that are known to interact in one organism will also interact. such relationships are often referred to as interologs  <cit> . for example, at blast e-values below 10- <dig>  it has been shown that 16–30% of yeast interactions can be transferred to the worm  <cit>  while further studies have estimated that a joint e-value below 10- <dig> is required to transfer interactions reliably between organisms  <cit> . interologs have been used to predict protein-protein interactions in human  <cit> .

4) predictors based on functional features exploit non-sequence information to infer interactions. some predictors exploit the observation that there is a significant correlation in the expression levels of transcripts encoding proteins that interact  <cit> . since proteins must be co-localized in order to interact, protein subcellular localization has often been used to assess the quality of interaction datasets  <cit> . similarly, interacting proteins are also often involved in similar cellular processes, so gene ontology "process" and "function" annotations have been exploited to predict interactions and validate high-throughput datasets  <cit> .

5) predictors have exploited similarities in the network topology of known interaction datasets to predict novel interactions. in one study, the local topology of small-world networks has been used to assess the quality of interaction datasets and predict novel interactions  <cit>  while gerstein and colleagues have investigated the prediction of interactions by the identification of missing edges in almost fully connected complexes  <cit> .

in addition to these diverse approaches, some groups have combined concepts from several of the above categories in integrative frameworks. the first such predictor integrated co-expression data, co-essentiality as well as biological function in a naïve bayes network to provide proteome-wide de novo prediction of yeast protein interactions  <cit> . subsequently, the combination of many more diverse features was investigated using different frameworks to predict yeast protein-protein interactions, increasing the prediction accuracy and allowing an assessment of the limits of genomic integration  <cit> . the integration of diverse genomic features has also been useful in the investigation of the related but broader problem of predicting protein-protein associations as well as complex and pathway membership .

although, many computational methods have investigated the prediction of protein-protein interactions, few have so far been applied to the human proteome. the first large-scale prediction of the human interactome map involved transferring interactions from model organisms  <cit> . this resulted in over  <dig> predicted physical interactions involving approximately  <dig> human proteins. a second method integrated expression data, orthology, protein domain data and functional annotations into a probabilistic framework and resulted in the prediction of nearly  <dig> human protein interactions  <cit> . it has recently been estimated that the false-positive rates of these computational datasets as well as of available high-throughput human interaction datasets are, on average, as high as 90% and their coverage is only approximately 10%, indicating that more such efforts are needed to increase the coverage and confidence we have in current maps of the human interactome  <cit> .

in this paper, the prediction of physical interactions between human proteins has been investigated by integrating in a bayesian framework several different pieces of evidence including orthology, functional features and local network topology. in order to increase the accuracy and coverage of the predictions, different types of negative data  were explored to train the predictor. the most accurate of the predictors was then used to assess the likelihood of pair-wise interaction for over  <dig> human proteins from the ipi  database. these predictions provide a likelihood of interaction for over  <dig> million human protein pairs and lead to the prediction of over  <dig> human interactions. they should thus augment current knowledge of the human interactome as well as the understanding of the relationship between distinct cellular processes.

RESULTS
architecture of the predictor and training of the modules
the prediction of human protein-protein interactions was investigated in a bayesian framework by considering combinations of individual protein features known to be indicative of interaction. the seven individual features considered are summarized in table  <dig> and detailed in the methods section. as indicated in table  <dig>  the different features were grouped into five distinct modules: expression , orthology , combined , disorder  and transitive . figure  <dig> illustrates the training scheme and architecture of the method. the expression, orthology, combined and disorder modules can calculate likelihood ratios  of interaction independently and are referred to as the group a modules . the product of their likelihood ratios is referred to as the preliminary score. the transitive module considers the local topology of the network predicted by the group a modules and thus requires the completion of their analysis to calculate its own likelihood ratios of interaction . as such, all combinations of the group a modules can be used to predict interaction in the presence or absence of the transitive module. in the absence of the transitive module, the preliminary score is used as the final likelihood ratio output by the predictor.

the likelihood ratios of interaction are evaluated for each module by considering the relative proportions of positive and negative training examples that have a specific state . the datasets used to train the predictor consisted of  <dig> known human protein interactions extracted from the human protein reference database   <cit>  and approximately  <dig> times more randomly chosen protein pairs used as negative examples. the composition of the datasets and likelihood ratio calculations are explained in greater detail in the methods section. once the final likelihood ratio of interaction  is calculated for a given protein pair as shown in figure 1b, it is possible to estimate the posterior odds ratio of interaction by multiplying the final likelihood ratio by the prior odds ratio of interaction. protein pairs that have a posterior odds of interaction above  <dig> are more likely to interact than not to interact, thus providing an obvious threshold to predict interacting proteins. estimates for the prior odds ratio of interaction vary. previous interaction studies on yeast and human use prior odds ratios that range from 1/ <dig> to > 1/ <dig>  <cit> . the evaluation of this ratio is difficult because not all true interactions are known. as detailed in methods, the prior odds ratio for human protein interaction was explored by considering different versions and subsets of human interaction datasets. this suggested that there is insufficient data currently available to determine a reliable ratio for human. accordingly, we selected a prior odds ratio of interaction of 1/ <dig> which is similar to current estimates for yeast and is probably still quite conservative. thus, the likelihood ratio threshold to predict interactions is  <dig> 

likelihood ratios of the modules
the expression module follows trends seen in previous studies with increasing likelihood ratios of interaction reflecting increasing expression correlation  <cit> . however, since the highest likelihood ratio for the expression datasets that we consider is  <dig>  they are not sufficient on their own to predict interacting protein pairs with a posterior odds ratio above  <dig>  similarly, but in a much more pronounced way, the disorder module is only slightly predictive of interaction, with a maximum likelihood ratio of  <dig> .

most states of the orthology module achieve higher likelihood ratios than the highest obtained by the expression and disorder modules. this is not surprising as the transfer of interacting orthologs  from one organism to another is a popular method to predict interactions , particularly in the case of organisms like human for which only a small proportion of interactions are known. the direct transfer of interactions to human from either yeast, fly or worm does not alone result in a posterior odds ratio above  <dig> . this is not surprising as previous studies have indicated that quite stringent joint e-values must be used to transfer interactions safely between organisms  <cit> . in contrast, the consideration of human interactions paralogous to the human protein pairs under investigation results in likelihood ratios of  <dig> and  <dig>  which is much higher than those obtained for any single model organism. this agrees with a recent report that suggested protein-protein interactions are more conserved within species than across species  <cit> .

the combined module uses domain co-occurrence, post-translational modification  co-occurrence and subcellular localization information to predict interaction. these features were originally investigated separately, as shown in figure  <dig>  but their combination into one module that considers all dependencies between them achieves higher accuracy  and higher likelihood ratios  while still being computationally feasible. additionally, this combination circumvents possible problems of dependence between these features.

previous methods have investigated the use of co-occurring domains to predict interaction . many pairs of domains co-occur in proteins known to interact. when investigated as a separate feature, the chi-square score of co-occurrence of domain pairs correlates well with the likelihood of interaction of protein pairs that contain these domains, with the highest chi-square score bin obtaining a likelihood ratio of  <dig>  as shown in figure 3a. similarly, the co-occurrence of ptms is also predictive of interaction, with its highest scoring bin obtaining a likelihood ratio of  <dig> as shown in figure 3b. lists of high scoring domain pairs and ptm pairs are shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

subcellular localization has been extensively used both to assess the quality of interaction datasets  <cit>  and to generate examples of non-interacting protein pairs to use as negative datasets when training and testing predictors  <cit> . in the present study, the use of localization was investigated as a feature predictive of interaction. four possible localization states were considered for protein pairs: same compartment, neighboring compartments, different non-neighboring compartments and absence of localization annotation . as shown in figure 3c, the likelihood ratio of same compartment protein pairs was found to be twice as high as that of randomly chosen or non-annotated protein pairs whereas different non-neighboring protein pairs are more than three times less likely to interact than random protein pairs individual localization features achieve low interaction likelihood ratios. however, when integrated into the combined module, domain, ptm and localization information together achieve likelihood ratios that are high enough to predict interaction on their own . as expected, the highest likelihood ratio bins for the combined module are those representing the highest combinations of the three features separately.

the transitive module enhances the preliminary likelihood score   by considering the local topology of the resulting network which is assessed using the neighborhood topology score as detailed in the methods section. the likelihood ratios for different values of the neighborhood topology score are shown in figure 1b. the transitive module is highly predictive of interaction and achieves likelihood ratios as high as  <dig>  this module cannot be used alone as it requires as input the output of at least one group a module. however, it can predict interacting protein pairs with a posterior odds ratio above  <dig>  when used in combination with any single module in group a .

independence of the modules
the final likelihood ratio output by the predictor is only representative of the true likelihood of interaction of a protein pair if the modules considered are independent. if the modules were not independent, some likelihood ratios would likely be overestimated, particularly for protein pairs that achieve simultaneously high likelihoods for non-independent features. conversely, some likelihood ratios would be underestimated for protein pairs achieving simultaneously low likelihoods for non-independent features. previous studies have demonstrated that some of the features considered here are indeed independent  <cit> . independence of all modules used in our predictor was verified by calculating pearson correlation coefficients for all pairs of modules. as shown in table  <dig>  all modules considered are independent, since the highest pearson correlation coefficients computed are well below any value considered significant.

accuracy of the predictors
all combinations of modules were examined to determine which of the resulting predictors achieved the highest prediction accuracy. in order to analyze the predictions, five-fold cross validation experiments were performed and the area under partial roc  curves  measured. roc <dig> and roc <dig> curves were selected as they consider a large enough number of positives to include all protein pairs predicted to have a posterior odds ratio above  <dig>  by all the predictors investigated. protein pairs predicted to have a posterior odds ratio below  <dig>  have an estimated true positive rate below 50% and thus are more likely not to interact than to interact. these protein pairs are therefore not of interest in this context. the area under all rocn curves considered is relatively low because of the high proportion of negatives with respect to positives in the training and test sets .

as the scores of the predictors increase, so do the number of interactions predicted above different posterior odds ratio thresholds . for example, the expression-orthology predictor achieves a roc <dig> auc of  <dig>  and predicts  <dig> interactions at a posterior odds ratio greater than  <dig> whereas the expression-orthology-combined predictor achieves a roc <dig> auc of  <dig>  and predicts over  <dig> interactions at a posterior odds ratio above  <dig>  the best combination of group a modules is the predictor consisting of the expression, orthology and combined modules.

the transitive module, which can only be used in combination with other modules, increases substantially the scores and number of interactions predicted. the right-hand portion of table  <dig> shows the accuracy measures for the highest scoring subset of predictors that consider the transitive module. the transitive module enhances the prediction by identifying among protein pairs with a relatively high preliminary score those that are most likely to interact, by considering the local topology of the network around them. for example, the roc <dig> auc rises from  <dig>  to  <dig>  when the transitive module is added to the expression-orthology-combined predictor, and the number of predictions above a posterior odds ratio of  <dig> doubles from  <dig> to  <dig>  once again, the disorder module does not contribute positively to the prediction. its inclusion does not increase any of the measures of accuracy considered. the predictor that considers the expression, orthology, combined and transitive modules is the one that achieves the highest accuracy overall. it is this predictor that is further analyzed in the next sections.

comparison to predictions generated using alternative training sets
in this work training sets were used that comprised  <dig> times more negatives than positives, with the negatives randomly selected and filtered to remove any known or suspected positives . other groups have used negative:positive ratios ranging from  <dig> to more than  <dig> . in addition, several groups use localization-derived negatives  rather than randomly chosen negatives . these issues have been investigated previously  <cit> .

since the choice of negative training data may influence the method, the choice of different training sets in the context of the probabilistic predictor presented here was investigated to determine which type of training set offers the highest accuracy.

a the rocn aucs are an average of five separate experiments . their standard deviation is shown in parenthesis.

the effect of localization-derived negatives rather than randomly chosen negatives was also investigated to see if it would increase the prediction accuracy. a criticism of randomly chosen negatives is that they will contain some true interactors. however, the set of interacting pairs in the full protein pair space is small and thus the contamination rate of randomly chosen negative datasets will in fact be very low. contamination is probably below 1%, which is likely lower than the contamination rate of the positive dataset as discussed in  <cit> . localization-derived negatives, on the other hand, should be free of contamination, if the localization annotations are complete and accurate, both conditions that are difficult to obtain as discussed in  <cit> . however, one can argue that localization-derived negatives might not be able to capture the full diversity of the non-interacting protein space since many proteins in the same cellular compartment do not interact. in addition, proteins specific to a cellular compartment may have different characteristics to proteins in other compartments. such predictors may not generalize well when predicting on cell-wide protein pairs which consist not only of non-colocalized non-interacting pairs but also numerous protein pairs that do not interact but are present in the same cellular compartment. these issues have been discussed previously  <cit> . in order to see if different types of negatives could influence the accuracy of the predictors developed here we generated negative training/test sets as in  <cit>  by identifying all pairs of human proteins for which one protein is annotated as being nuclear and the other is annotated as being localized to the plasma membrane in the hprd database  <cit> . the combined module for these predictors only considers domains and ptms but not subcellular localization as this would result in using this feature both in the selection of the training set and as a feature predictive of interaction. the localization-derived negative trained predictor tested on sets containing localization-derived negatives achieves a lower accuracy than that of the random negative trained predictor tested on a test set containing randomly-generated negatives . this is most likely due to the fact that the localization-derived negative trained predictor cannot take full advantage of the transitive module, since the network resulting from the predictions of the group a modules likely does not sample the whole protein pair space well.

our predictor trained with randomly generated negatives and a negative:positive ratio of  <dig> performs the best out of all the combinations of training sets investigated. it is this predictor that is further analyzed in subsequent sections.

contribution of the modules
the relative contribution of the modules to the prediction of interaction was investigated in order to gain a better understanding of the predictive power and areas of highest usefulness of the different modules. to do this, all protein pairs were considered that achieve an estimated posterior odds ratio >  <dig> when the eoct predictor was trained on the full datasets without cross-validation. this set consists of  <dig> distinct predicted interactions and is referred to as the lr <dig> dataset . these protein pairs represent the most probable interactors with respect to the features considered, among all protein pairs examined by the predictor.

to investigate the individual contribution of each module, we looked at the number of interactions predicted out of all lr <dig> pairs as a function of the minimum likelihood ratio of each module. as shown in figure 4a, all modules contribute positively  to the prediction of a certain proportion of the interactions in the lr <dig> dataset. the transitive module and to an even greater extent, the combined module contribute positively to the prediction of a very high proportion of the lr <dig> protein pairs . the transitive module provides a likelihood ratio of  <dig> for the prediction of over 70% of the lr <dig> interactions. the combined module provides positive evidence for the highest number of interactions of the lr <dig> dataset. however, the value of the likelihood ratio it contributes is below  <dig> for over 50% of protein pairs in the lr <dig> dataset . the combined module does, however, achieve likelihood ratios high enough to predict over two thousand interactions of the lr <dig> dataset on its own, less than 15% of which are present in the training set. the orthology module contributes to the prediction of only  <dig> protein pairs in the lr <dig> dataset . however, a large majority  of these  <dig> predicted interactions achieve likelihood ratios above  <dig> from this module. in fact, almost 40% of these lr <dig> interactions achieve a likelihood ratio above  <dig> from the orthology module. this indicates that most interactions predicted by the orthology module  are based on the highest scoring orthology bins  which are the most conserved yeast interactions , as well as human paralogous interactions and interactions found in more than one model organism . few interactions in the lr <dig> dataset are predicted on the basis of having interacting orthologs in worm or fly alone. the expression module provides positive evidence for a little less than half the predictions in the lr <dig> dataset. however, as previously noted, the highest likelihood provided by this module is  <dig> and thus the expression module cannot predict interaction on its own.

comparison to other interaction datasets
the false positive rate  of our predictor was estimated by the method of d'haeseleer and church  <cit>  and used to compare it to other prediction datasets. the ramani interaction dataset that was automatically extracted from the literature  <cit>  as well as all new interactions present in the october  <dig> version of the manually curated hprd database  <cit>   were taken as reference datasets. the d'haeseleer and church method compares two experimental datasets to a reference set and assumes that all intersections between the three datasets contain true positives. it is thus possible to estimate the number of true positives predicted by an experimental dataset by comparing the number of interactions present in the different intersections of the two experimental methods and the reference dataset . here, we compare three human interaction prediction datasets: the rhodes probabilistic dataset  <cit> , the lehner orthology-derived dataset  <cit>  and the most accurate of our predictors . we estimated false positive rates for each of the datasets by comparing them two by two to one of the reference datasets, thus generating  <dig> to  <dig> different estimates of false positive rates for each computational dataset, as shown in figure 6a . the rates estimated for the rhodes and lehner datasets are similar to previous estimates  <cit> . the estimated false positive rates for the lr <dig>  rhodes and core lehner are quite similar  and well below the overall average false-positive rate of 90% estimated for most available human high-throughput experimental and prediction interaction datasets  <cit> . it should be noted that the rhodes, lehner and ramani datasets annotate interactions as a relationship between human genes and not their protein products directly. however, not all proteins encoded by a single gene will necessarily interact with all protein products encoded by a second gene, even if one such protein pair does. this is why we describe interactions as a relationship between two proteins, allowing for a more precise description of the interaction. to compare our predictions to these datasets, we consider that two genes interact if at least one of their respective protein products interact.

in figure 6b and 6c, we compare the number of distinct proteins and distinct interactions of the lr <dig> dataset to those of the rhodes prediction dataset and the june  <dig> version of the hprd which was used to train our predictor. the rhodes dataset was trained using an earlier version of the hprd. as can be seen in figure  <dig>  the intersections between the three datasets considered are low, especially when comparing the interactions. both the rhodes dataset and our lr <dig> dataset predict interactions involving many proteins that are not even present in their positive training set . many of the predictions in these two datasets concern protein pairs and proteins that are not present in other datasets, suggesting that they cover different regions of the human interaction space. as suggested in  <cit> , by making more such datasets available, it will be possible to increase our coverage of the interaction space and determine the most likely human interactions.

another human interaction dataset has recently become available: the intnetdb  <cit> . it was generated by integrating seven different features  in a probabilistic framework. interactions were predicted above a tp/fp ratio  of  <dig>  using such a threshold, the authors claim to predict  <dig>  <dig> human interactions. we do not compare our predictions to this dataset because such a threshold of tp/fp >  <dig> does not correspond to a posterior odds threshold >  <dig>  depending on the positive-to-negative ratio used in the datasets, tp/fp >  <dig> might correspond to an average posterior odds ratio of  <dig>  in contrast, the average posterior odds ratio of our lr <dig> dataset is above  <dig>  in comparison, by using a threshold of tp/fp >  <dig> in our test set, we predict over  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> human interactions. we do not believe that the quality of this large number of predictions is high enough to warrant their publication since the great majority of these protein pairs achieve a posterior odds ratio below  <dig> 

independent validation
although the overlap between the lr <dig> dataset and the hprd-derived positive training set is below 10% as shown in figure 6c, the proportion of interactions common to these two sets is not equally distributed for all posterior odds ratios of interaction values. as shown in figure  <dig>  while less than 3% of the protein pairs predicted to interact at posterior odds ratios between  <dig> and  <dig> overlap with the hprd dataset used for training, this value increases to over 50% for the highest scoring subsets of the lr <dig> dataset. these highest scoring predictions receive high likelihood ratios of interaction from all four predictive modules and represent the strongest examples of interaction as evaluated by our predictor. such examples include interactions that allow the formation of well-known protein complexes such as the proteasome, the mcm protein complex involved in the initiation of genome replication, replication factor c, the tbp/taf complex  and the eif complex . the highest scoring predictions in the lr <dig> dataset thus mainly represent interactions present in the hprd dataset as well as interactions between proteins that have strong sequence identity to these known interacting pairs. however, as the posterior odds ratio decreases, the overlap between the predictions and the hprd-derived training set decreases. some subsets of quite high posterior odds have much smaller overlaps with the training set. for example, interactions predicted at posterior odds ratios between  <dig> and  <dig> have a  <dig> to 30% overlap with the training set as shown in figure  <dig>  although many of these novel predictions have not been previously investigated in the literature, there exists experimental evidence supporting a subset of these predictions which is not present in the june  <dig> version of the hprd used to train our predictor, thus providing independent validation of our method. five such validated predictions are reported here:

-tcptp was predicted to interact with stat <dig> at a posterior odds ratio of  <dig>  it has been recently reported that tcptp, the only protein tyrosine phosphatase known to localize to the nucleus, dephosphorylates stat <dig> in this cellular compartment, which may in turn lead to the suppression of interleukine- <dig>  induced signaling  <cit> .

-n-wasp and arp <dig> achieve a predicted posterior odds ratio of interaction of  <dig>  a recent report suggested that the iqgap <dig> protein can activate n-wasp thus changing its conformation and allowing it to bind the arp2/ <dig> complex, which in turn directs the generation of branched actin filaments required for the extension of a lamellipodium  <cit> .

-the vamp3-vti1a interaction was predicted with a posterior odds ratio of  <dig>  both these proteins are believed to be part of the snare  family of proteins which are involved in membrane fusion events. vti1a is a trans-golgi-network-localized putative t-snare  <cit>  and vamp <dig> is an early/recycling endosomal v-snare  <cit> . these two proteins were recently shown to interact, leading to their functional implication in the post-golgi retrograde transport step  <cit> .

-cdk <dig> and mcm <dig> were predicted to interact at a posterior odds ratio of  <dig>  cdk <dig> has recently been shown to phosphorylate mcm <dig>  a subunit of a putative replicative helicase essential for dna replication, on two distinct residues, leading to a change in its affinity to chromatin and its enrichment in the nucleolus  <cit> .

-sam <dig> and smad <dig> achieve a predicted posterior odds ratio of  <dig>  this interaction has been experimentally demonstrated by large-scale yeast-two-hybrid analysis of the smad signaling system  <cit> .

our probabilistic predictor therefore not only reproduces and completes well-known protein complexes but also identifies novel interactions, a subset of which have been independently validated.

CONCLUSIONS
the current human protein interaction map is estimated to be only 10% complete  <cit> . here, we investigated the prediction of human protein-protein interactions in an effort to increase the coverage of the human interactome while simultaneously providing high quality predictions. by considering several different types of orthogonal and quite distinct features including expression, orthology, combined protein characteristics and local network topology, we predicted over  <dig> human protein interactions and explored a subspace of the human interactome that has not been investigated by previous large interaction datasets. our investigation led us to compare the influence of different training sets on the prediction accuracy. the use of randomly generated negative training examples and large negative-to-positive ratios in the training set generated the most accurate predictors in the context of our model. a comparison to other large human interaction datasets revealed the average false positive rate of our dataset to be 76%, which is much lower than the overall average for most large scale, currently available, human interaction datasets  estimated to be 90%  <cit> . a subset of our novel predictions have been independently validated by identifying recent reports that experimentally investigated and confirmed that these protein pairs do interact. we provide all our predictions ranked according to the posterior odds ratio of interaction in additional file  <dig>  it is thus possible to restrict the dataset to the highest scoring protein pairs . by making this human interaction prediction dataset publicly available, it is our hope that it will help to identify the most high-confidence interactions, leading to a more complete and accurate human interaction map.
