BACKGROUND
antibiotic resistance  raises global issues regarding to multidrug-resistant and overuse of antibiotics  <cit> . it has been established that the spread of abr and virulence is often mediated by mobile genetic elements including insertion sequence, transposons, integrons, bacteriophage, genomic island , plasmids and combinations of these elements . plasmids and other mobile dna elements can be more easily transferred than chromosomal dna between genera, phyla and even major domains by a mechanism known as conjugation . direct evidence has established that tetracycline resistance-encoding plasmids  disseminate between different aeromonas species and escherichia coli in various environments  <cit> . horizontal gene transfer  is also important for genome plasticity. it has been reported that approximately 3/ <dig> of genes in the bacterial genomes have been acquired by hgt  <cit> , which is essential for bacteria to adapt to various growth niches. though there are several reports about the genetic screen for bacterial plasmid conjugation, the knowledge about the detailed processes and genetic basis that control the transfer of the plasmid to another host cell is still lacking.

bacteria utilize secretion systems to transport numerous substrates across cellular membranes, mediating their virulence and survival. the type iv secretion system t4ss is unique and present in many pathogens to mediate both genetic exchange and the delivery of effector proteins to target eukaryotic cells  <cit> . t4ss in agrobacterium tumefaciens delivers oncogenic nucleoprotein particles into plant cells, resulting in the development of crown-gall tumors  <cit> . a. tumefaciens t4ss is composed of  <dig> proteins, virb1 ~  <dig> and vird <dig>  while virb proteins can be grouped into three classes: the putative channel components ; the energy components ; and the pilus-associated components   <cit> . the machines assembled from virb homologs are proposed as type iva  and are widespread to mediate the conjugative transfer of plasmids and thus promote dissemination of multiple-antibiotic resistance  <cit> .


edwardsiella piscicida is a bacterial pathogen causing edwardsiellosis in over  <dig> piscine species such as flatfish, eel and tilapia, resulting in huge economic losses in worldwide aquaculture industries  <cit> . e. piscicida is a facultative intracellular pathogen and develops the ability to resist killing by professional phagocytes and colonize and replicate in macrophages . in our previous study, the genome of a typical highly virulent e. piscicida strain eib <dig> was published  <cit> . the horizontally acquired two-component system esra-esrb has been established to be essential for its pathogenesis mediated by type iii and vi secretion systems  . a plasmid  of  <dig>  bp was identified from the assembled sequence  <cit> . six genes in the sequence of peib <dig> were identified to be involved with abr, providing genetic properties for multi-drug resistance in eib <dig>  including teta and tetr for tetracycline, stra and strb for streptomycin, sulii for sulfonamide, and cata <dig> for chloramphenicol resistance. genetic analysis suggested that the chloramphenicol resistance might be recently acquired by the plasmid  <cit> . in addition, this plasmid encoding an incomplete set of t4as proteins   <cit> . it is unknown whether these t4as proteins involved in the acquisition of the plasmid by the bacterium.

in this study, we identified that the self-transmissible peib <dig> is not involved in virulence and colonization of e. piscicida at least in the zebrafish model we used in this study. we used transposon insertion sequencing  technology to investigate genetic basis of peib <dig> on conjugation transfer of peib <dig>  and identified all of the t4ss related proteins on peib <dig> and putative lipoproteins as horizontal transfer enhancer, and the topa as the related inhibitor. intriguingly, response regulator esrb encoded in the chromosome was found to facilitate the conjugation through inducing the expression of genes associated with antibiotics resistance and t4ss. our data unraveled the genetic basis of the conjugation transfer of peib <dig> and the influence of horizontally acquired esrb on the plasmid transfer efficiency.

quantitative real-time pcr . rna samples were extracted by using the rna isolation kit . rnase-free dnase i  was used to remove dna contamination in the rna sample. one microgram rna was used as a template for first strand cdna synthesis with the primescript reverse transcriptase . qrt-pcr analysis was performed in a total volume of 20 μl, containing 1 μl of diluted cdna, 1 μl of each primer  , 10 μl of faststart universal sybr green master  and 7 μl deionized water. qrt-pcr was performed with the  <dig> realtime pcr system  under the following conditions: 95 °c for 10 min; 40 cycles at 95 °c for 15 s, and 60 °c for 1 min. melting curve analysis of amplification products was performed at the end of each pcr to confirm that only one pcr product had been amplified. relative quantification was performed using the comparative ct  method  <cit> , with the housekeeping gene gyrb as an internal control.table  <dig> primers used in this study






































bacterial conjugation and transfer efficiency. equal amounts  of secondary inocula of recipient and donor cells were washed twice with fresh lb to remove residual antibiotics, then mixed and resuspended in 400 μl lb. 35 μl of mixture was dropped on  <dig>  μm millipore filter membranes  placed on lb agar plate and incubated at 30 °c for 8 h. for tests of the influence of antibiotics on conjugation, the filter membranes were put on lb agar plates containing sublethal concentrations of indicated antibiotics . bacteria washed out from the membranes were serially diluted with pbs and plated to determine the bacterial loads. the conjugants were differentiated from other strains based on their antibiotics resistance. the ratios of conjugants counts to donor strains were used to determine the transfer efficiency.

construction of ∆p::pnq705k. the kanamycin open reading frame fragment was pcr-amplified from p34s-km plasmid using the primer pairs kmcs-f /r  , digested with sali and ligated with linearized pnq <dig>  the resulting plasmid pnq705k was digested with xbai. the glms fragment was amplified from eib <dig> genomic dna using the primer pairs glms-f/r and cloned into linearized pnq705k by gibson assembly  <cit> . the resulting plasmid pnq705km-glms were transformed into eib <dig> ∆p by conjugation and the targeted eib <dig> ∆p::pnq705k was validated using the primer pair glms-yz-f/kmcs-r .

transposon insertion sequencing  and data analysis. we followed the protocol described previously to create transposon insertion libraries and perform tis  <cit> . in brief, overnight cultures of sm <dig> λpir/pmpr  and eib202/peib <dig> were mixed and incubated for 8 h. exconjugant cells with the gmr tn inserted into the chromosome or plasmid of eib <dig> carrying peib <dig> were recovered on a total of  <dig> plates as colr, gmr, and strr colonies  that were resuspended and collected as the input library. total plasmid dna was extracted from a 5 ml aliquot  of the input library. another aliquot of the input library  was used as the donor in a second round of conjugation with the new recipient eib <dig> ∆p::pnq705k . exconjugants were selected as kmr, gmr, and strr colonies; this scheme selects for tn insertion in peib <dig>  that are still capable of transmission. about 8 ×  <dig> kmr, gmr, and strr colonies were collected and designated as the output library . for each library, plasmid dna  from 5 ml bacteria was extracted via the tianprep mini plasmid kit , diluted in 100 μl miniq water to a final concentration of 50 ng/μl in the  <dig>  ml tube and sonicated by bioruptor machine  with 30 s on/90 s off for 12 cycles. the sheared dna length was in the range of 200–600 bp as shown by electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel. dna libraries were constructed using the vahts turbo dna library preparation kit  and sequenced on an illumina miseq platform . the sequencing reads were mapped to e. piscicida peib <dig> by bowtie  <cit> . after mapping, the reads per ta site were tallied and assigned to annotated genes or intergenic regions using previously described scripts  <cit> .

construction of deletion mutant. in-frame deletion mutants were generated by the sacb-based allelic exchange as previously described  <cit> . upstream and downstream fragments were generated by pcr with primer pairs p1/p <dig> and p3/p <dig> listed in table  <dig>  respectively. the resulting fragments were cloned into sacb suicide vector pdmk using gibson assembly and transformed into dh5α λpir, clones were validated with the primer pair pdmk-pf/pr. after sequencing, the resulting plasmids were transformed into sm <dig> λpir, and then mated into eib <dig> by conjugation. double crossover processes were selected sequentially on tsa medium containing col and km and then on tsa with 12%  sucrose to complete homologous recombination. the targeted mutants were confirmed by pcr using the primer pairs in-f/r, out-f/r and evpp-f/r, and sequencing of the deleted region.

determination of minimum inhibitory concentration . inocula of wt and ∆esrb strains were seeded into lb culture with different amount of antibiotics in 96-well plates and incubated at 30 °c for 24 h.

determination of peib <dig> copy number. as previous described  <cit> , genomic dna was extracted from log phase cultures with the gdna purification kit  and subjected to qpcr in  <dig> realtime pcr system  with faststart universal sybr green master . virb <dig> and gyrb loci were used for plasmid and chromosome quantification, respectively. a standard plasmid  that contains chromosomal  and plasmid dna  fragments for qpcr analyses for measurement of peib <dig> copy number was constructed by first amplifying virb <dig> and gyrb target regions and then inserting them into pdmk by gibson assembly. the primers used for these experiments are listed in table  <dig> 

total rna extraction and mrna enrichment. the wt strain and the ∆esrb mutant were cultured in lb and dmem, respectively, at 30 °c without shaking for 24 h. rna samples were extracted using an rna isolation kit . dnase i  and ribo-zero-rrna removal kits for gram-negative bacteria  were used to remove dna and rrna following the manufacturer’s instructions. prior to reverse transcription, regular pcr was routinely performed using the isolated rna sample as a template to confirm that there was no dna contamination. samples used for rna-seq were validated using an agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer , and the final concentration was measured using a qubit  <dig>  fluorometer .

rna-seq transcriptome generation and data analysis. first-strand cdna synthesis from rrna-depleted samples was carried out using truseq rna sample prep . the cdna was purified using the rna clean and concentrator- <dig> kit . following second-strand synthesis, the reactions were cleaned up with ampure xp beads followed by end repair, adenylation of 3′ ends and ligation of adapters. the reaction products were cleaned with ampure xp beads and treated with uracil-n-glycosylase using the amperase kit . finally, pcr  was used to amplify the library and to enrich the fragments that were ligated to the sequencing adapters. libraries were sequenced on the hiseq  <dig> platform to yield 100-base-pair end-reads. adapter sequences and low-quality bases  were trimmed by the trimmomatic package using the default parameters, and truncated reads smaller than 35 bp were discarded  <cit> . then, the bwa program  <cit>  was used to align the remaining reads to the reference sequences of e. piscicida eib <dig> . the number of reads mapped to each gene was determined by picard tools  and normalized to the reads per kilobase of genic region per million mapped reads  to obtain the relative level of expression. an analysis of variance was performed on the average expression of the three biological replicates to identify genes that showed differential expression under the tested condition . the differential expression analysis was performed using the degseq package  <cit> . the fold changes of genes of interest were validated using qrt-pcr. the rna-seq datasets have been deposited in the ncbi genbank under accession number srp <dig> 

zebrafish maintance, ld <dig> and competitive indices analysis. the zebrafish maintenance and challenge were performed as previously described  <cit> . healthy zebrafish  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g were raised in reverse osmosis purified water in a flow-through auto-controlled system at 25 °c and acclimatized at least 10 days. the strains of wt, ∆p, and ∆esrb were harvested and serially diluted with pbs, respectively. zebrafish were anesthetized with tricaine methanesulfonate  at a concentration of 80 mg/l and intramuscularly  injected with the strains at doses ranging from 5 ×  <dig> to 5 × 105 cfu/fish. thirty fish were injected with each dilution and divided randomly into three groups. fish injected with pbs served as negative controls. the mortalities were recorded over a period of 7 days after infection. the ld <dig> values were calculated via the method described by fernández et al.  <cit> . competitive indices were determined between each strain. the indicated strains were equally mixed and serially diluted with pbs into 1 × 103 cfu/fish. at 72 h post injection,  <dig> fish were homogenized respectively and plated to determine the bacterial loads. wt  was differentiated from wt using lba containing x-gal , and ∆p was differentiated from wt based on str resistance.

RESULTS
peib <dig> is not required for virulence and colonization of e. piscicida. previous whole genome sequencing indicated that e. piscicida eib <dig>  harbors a multi-drug resistance plasmid peib <dig>  <cit> . to characterize the roles of peib <dig> on virulence of e. piscicida, healthy zebrafish were intramuscularly  infected with serial dilutions of bacterial suspensions of wt, ∆p, and ∆esrb, respectively. the results indicated that ld <dig> value of eib <dig> was  <dig>  × 102 cfu/fish during 7 days of observation . ∆esrb showed significant virulence attenuation with an ld50 ~ 1000-fold higher than that of wt, as previously reported  <cit> . the ld <dig> value of ∆p showed no obvious difference with that of wt. we further analyzed the effect of peib <dig> curing on the colonization of e. piscicida. the wt carrying lacz, wt , was equally mixed with wt and inoculated into the turbot fish. similarly, ∆p was also used to compete against wt in vivo in fish. after 72 h competition in zebrafish, wt , wt, and ∆p showed similar colonization capacity . collectively, these results indicated that peib <dig> appears to be not required for virulence and in vivo colonization of e. piscicida.table  <dig> virulence towards zebrafish  and mic of each strain

peib <dig> is self-transmissible under various conditions. our previous investigation indicated that peib <dig> can be transferred in lb medium  <cit> . to further analyze the transfer capacity of the plasmid, we generated the strain ∆p::pnq705k, a peib202-cured strain which carries km resistance gene inserted in a neutral site of the chromosome . the conjugation of peib <dig>  from wt  to ∆p::pnq705k  was performed under various conditions and then the conjugants thus could be differentiated from donor and recipient by km and str resistance. the transfer efficiency of peib <dig> between wt and the peib202-cured strain ∆p::pnq705k is ~ <dig>  conjugant/donor after 4 h of conjugation . the conjugation efficiency significantly increased to  <dig>  conjugant/donor at the time of 8 h incubation . the plasmid peib <dig> can transfer through conjugation at the temperature ranging from 16 °c to 37 °c, though 30 °c is the optimum temperature for conjugation . we also investigated the conjugation condition with different antibiotics at sublethal concentrations . the plasmid peib <dig> encodes genes against four antibiotics namely chloramphenicol, streptomycin, tetracycline, and sulfonamide  <cit> . the subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations didn’t cause apparently reduced viability of recipient cells . notably, we found that sublethal of str, tet, and cm significantly inhibited the peib <dig> conjugation transfer, as compared to the standard conjugation operation in laboratory without antibiotics . the investigation of conjugation in various media indicated that peib <dig> could transfer in 2216e, m <dig>  and lb with similar efficiency, lbs significantly promotes the conjugation transfer, suggesting that 3% sodium is essential for conjugation processes . we also found that peib <dig> could be transferred from eib <dig> to enterobacteria , and also other pathogenic bacteria  in marine environments. otherwise, peib <dig> is also able to transfer back to e. piscicida . altogether, these data demonstrated that peib <dig> is able to transfer under various conditions.fig.  <dig> transfer frequency of peib <dig> under different conditions. the wt strain  carrying peib <dig> plasmid was conjugated with the eib <dig> plasmid-cured strain with km resistant gene inserted in a neutral site of the chromosome   and the conjugants were selected on str/km/col lb agar plates. a strains were conjugated for different time under 30 °c. b strains were conjugated under different temperatures for 8 h. c and d strains were conjugated at different antibiotics at their sublethal concentrations  and culture conditions under 30 °c for 8 h. e the transfer frequency between e. piscicida and other bacterial species. results were presented as mean ± sd . * p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> , student’s t-test




transposon insertion sequencing  reveals t4ss genes essential for peib <dig> transfer. we used tis to screen genes in peib <dig> required for conjugation transfer. suicide plasmid pmpr  carrying himar i mariner transposon was used for high-density mutagenesis of peib <dig>  our rationale is that if a plasmid gene made a positive contribution to  conjugation transfer of peib <dig> to the recipient ∆p::pnq705k, then insertion mutations in that gene would be under-presented in a library after selection for tranconjugants. conversely, if a gene made a negative contribution to  conjugation, then mutations in that gene would be over-presented. we set out to construct a highly saturated tn-insertion library in wt harboring peib <dig>  the set of peib <dig> insertions were subsequently referred to as the input library and used to donate mutated peib <dig> to another recipient ∆p::pnq705k and the resistant markers on the plasmid and transposon were used for selection of exconjugants. the set of peib <dig> insertion mutants in the ∆p::pnq705k exconjugants is referred to below as the output library. we compared the distribution of transposon insertion sites in the input and output libraries and identify peib <dig> genes affecting plasmid transfer with the previously described analysis pipeline  <cit> . insertions in genes in peib <dig> that are underrepresented or absent in the output library  likely correspond to loci that facilitate peib <dig> transfer, and over-represented in the output library likely negatively affect the plasmid transfer.

the input library included approximately  <dig>  reads that mapped to peib <dig> and covered  <dig> % of the plasmid ta sites, suggesting that the library is sufficiently saturated to identify genes essential for peib <dig> transfer. in the input library, the tn insertions were fairly evenly distributed around peib <dig>  the three output libraries contained  <dig>  reads ,  <dig>  reads  and,  <dig>  reads , respectively. using the hmm-based analytic pipeline  <cit> , we could profile the gene loci that possibly affect the replication, maintenance, conjugation transfer, or selection processes of peib <dig> in e. piscicida. some genes, including the tra, rep, and antibiotics resistance genes, showed significantly increased or decreased output reads but with lower output/input ratios , suggesting that they might contribute to the maintenance and replication or the selection process after conjugation . their exact roles could not be assigned for the above-mentioned complex processes and for the possibility of redundancy for each of the gene from the chromosome or plasmid encoded genes. we identified  <dig> genes with output/input ratios higher than 4-fold which might significantly affect the conjugation transfer of peib <dig> . notably, all of the ten t4ss virb proteins were identified as genes essential for peib <dig> transfer with a significantly  decreased  output. the gene topa, encoding a dna topoisomerase i, was the only candidate that inhibiting peib <dig> transfer  . insertions in the ta loci in this gene caused  <dig> -fold increase  in the output reads. all the regions related to the above-described  <dig> genes shared averaged input reads, suggesting that these genes were not associated with the maintenance or replication, but conjugation transfer in e. piscicida.

in order to further verify the tis identified genes as the regulators or modulators controlling peib <dig> transfer, we constructed in-frame deletion mutants and corresponding complement strains for topa, p <dig>  and virb <dig> and determined the transfer efficiency of the mutated peib <dig>  the mutant with a deletion in virb <dig>  encoding the channel component protein essential for t4ss function  <cit> , showed significantly reduced transfer frequency , suggesting that, as expected, the proper function of t4ss is required for peib <dig> horizontal transfer. putative lipoprotein p <dig> was also proved to be important for peib <dig> transfer . the plasmid without gene topa has a significantly higher transfer frequency in comparison to that of the wt . the transfer frequencies of their complement strains were recovered to the wt level .

it was intriguingly to find that p <dig> and topa are involved in the conjugation transfer. we further asked whether deletion of these genes in peib <dig> would affect the expression of virb genes, which subsequently modulates the t4ss function and activities to influence plasmid conjugation processes. we carried out qrt-pcr to test the expression of virb <dig> and virb <dig>  encoding two core proteins for t4ss function, in wt, Δp <dig> and Δtopa strains as well as their complement strains. the expression levels of virb genes were somewhat decreased when topa was absent; while that of Δp <dig> were similar to that of the wt . in addition, the relative transcription levels of virb <dig> and virb <dig> were not changed much when topa or p <dig> genes were back complemented into their respective deletion mutants, suggesting that the alterations of conjugation capacities in Δp <dig> and Δtopa might not be associated with the modulation of t4ss expression; taken together, these data demonstrated that virb genes, p <dig> and topa are essential for the peib <dig> transfer.

antibiotics modulate t4ss gene expression in peib <dig>  we were intrigued that how antibiotics could modulate the peib <dig> conjugation frequency in e. piscicida as shown in fig. 2c. we focused on the influences of antibiotics on plasmid conjugation as a whole process but did not consider the influence of antibiotics on the recipients’ activities. we first asked whether the copy number of peib <dig> would be significantly changed with the addition of sublethal antibiotics  str, tet, and cm. the data indicated that the copy number of peib <dig> was  <dig> – <dig>  per cell and appeared not to be significantly affected by the presence of the sublethal antibiotics str, tet, and cm during conjugation . in the tis data, the  <dig> antibiotics resistance genes shared the averaged input reads and showed no variations in the output reads , suggesting that the carrying of antibiotics resistance genes might not affect the peib <dig> transmission. qrt-pcr was further performed to analyze the expression of virb <dig> and virb <dig> in wt grown with or without sublethal concentrations of antibiotics str, tet, and cm. the transcriptional level of t4ss genes  was significantly reduced due to the addition of antibiotics as compared to that without antibiotics and the expression of other unrelated genes on chromosome or the plasmid , suggesting an inhibitory effect of these antibiotics on the expression t4ss in peib <dig> at sublethal concentrations.fig.  <dig> antibiotics inhibit the expression of t4ss but does not affect the copy number of peib <dig>  a copy number of peib <dig> in wt grown with or without antibiotics at their sublethal concentrations or in ∆esrb measured by qpcr. b qrt-pcr analysis of the expression of t4ss genes in wt grown with or without antibiotics at their sublethal concentrations . * p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> , student’s t-test




esrb activates the expression of t4ss and antibiotic resistance genes. the response regulator esrb encoded in the horizontal acquired t3ss gene cluster is essential for the bacterial virulence   <cit> . intriguingly, our results also showed that absence of esrb in the chromosome significantly decreased the conjugation frequency in e. piscicida . the copy number of peib <dig> was kept no change when esrb was absent as compared to the wt . in order to interrogate this, we performed rna-seq analysis with eib <dig> and ∆esrb rna isolated from lb  to compare their differential gene expression. rna-seq analysis was performed in triplicate and the reproducibility of the biological repeats was extremely high . a total of  <dig>  plasmid genes were up-regulated by at least 2-fold in wt, when wt and ∆esrb transcriptoms were compared . these data suggested that esrb also serves as an activator of plasmid gene expression in e. piscicida. notably, among all the  <dig> antibiotic resistance genes and  <dig> t4ss genes in peib <dig> nearly all antibiotics resistance  and t4ss genes  were markedly activated by esrb . we further compared the mic of cm, str, col, and tet for wt and Δesrb. the data indicated that, as compared to that of wt, Δesrb showed significantly decreased resistance towards cm, str, and tet, but remain similar col resistance , which is encoded on the chromosome. these data were well supporting the finding that esrb activates the antibiotics gene expression in the plasmid. collectively, our data demonstrated that esrb is essential for the conjugation transfer of peib <dig>  probably through regulating the expression of t4ss in lb.fig.  <dig> rna-seq analysis of differential plasmid gene expression of wt and ∆esrb cultured in lb  based on the normalized transcript levels. a scatter plots of rpkm values per orf in peib <dig> in biological replicates r <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig>  b numbers of differentially transcribed plasmid genes . c relative expression of antibiotics resistance and t4ss genes of peib <dig> that are differentially expressed in wt versus ∆esrb





discussion
bacterial antibiotics resistance has increasingly become a globally recognized concern. the capacities to exchange antibiotics resistance determinants conferred by horizontal gene transfer  have greatly intensified the issue. as a leading fish pathogen, e. piscicida harbors an array of antibiotics-resistance determinants in both of its chromosome and plasmids and well prepares for the antibiotics cocktail that might be present in the aquaculture environments  <cit> . furthermore, e. piscicida is an intracellular pathogen residing various cell types including phagocytes and epithelial cells, which may help the bacterium to escape the antibiotics attack and persist in the ecosystems. the way antibiotics affect the conjugation process and interact with the genetic basis of conjugation is still confusing. here we used the multi-drug resistance plasmid peib <dig> from a highly virulent e. piscicida strain eib <dig>  <cit>  to address this and our findings indicated that antibiotics or their mixture modulate the conjugation efficiencies. the t4ss genes in peib <dig> are required for the conjugation process. antibiotics appear to modulate conjugation frequencies by repressing t4ss gene expression. furthermore, the response regulator esrb encoded on the chromosome is also essential to facilitate the conjugation by up-regulating the t4ss genes. investigation of the gene transfer mediated by the plasmid conjugation in the growth conditions mimic of aquaculture farms will improve the understanding of requirements for plasmid conjugation processes and help evaluation of antibiotics treatment in the industries.

genetic analysis of peib <dig> indicated that it belongs to incp plasmid and is capable of replication and stable inheritance in a wide variety of gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . as compared to other reported plasmids carried by edwardsiella bacterium, such as pck <dig>  from e. piscicida  <cit> , p080813– <dig>  from e. anguillarum  <cit> , and pei1/ <dig>  and similar plasmids from e. ictaluri  <cit> , peib <dig>  found in e. piscicida strain eib <dig> is medium sized. in some edwardsiella strains, there are no plasmids. while some of the plasmids, i.e. pei1/ <dig> encoding t3ss genes, are highly associated to the bacterial pathogenesis  <cit> , many of the plasmids including peib <dig> in the bacterium bear multi-drug resistances and seems to mainly contribute to their survival in the antibiotics selection, while not the pathogenesis . it is also notable that chloramphenicol resistance plasmids from e. piscicida were increasingly reported in recent years in the aquaculture farms  <cit> . given that the presence of cata <dig> gene and the neighboring complex transposon issf <dig> containing is <dig> family transposase, as well as the extremely low g + c content of this region , as compared to average g + c content of the plasmid  or of the genome , the chloramphenicol resistance might emerge from a recent acquisition event through hgt in peib <dig> 

to make the situations severe, peib <dig> carries a set of t4ss which is believed and now proved by our experiment here to potently facilitate the conjugation and dissemination of the antibiotics-resistance genes in the environment. this should not only make the e. piscicida eib <dig> and other strains recalcitrant in aquaculture farms, but may also facilitate the hgt of pathogenic islands and their evolution for the emerging of other highly pathogenic strains like e. anguillarum  <cit> . indeed, peib <dig> can transfer through conjugation at various conditions with high frequencies between different bacterial species . with this in mind, we developed our recent licensed live attenuated vaccine wed from eib <dig> by curing of peib <dig> for biosafety concerns  <cit> . the plasmid peib <dig> encodes an incomplete set of components of t4ss namely virb <dig>  −b <dig>  −b <dig>  −b <dig>  −b <dig>  −b <dig>  −b <dig>  −b <dig>  −d <dig>  and-d <dig> without –b <dig>  −b <dig>  −b <dig>  <cit> . structural and biochemical analysis of t4ss indicated that the inner membrane protein virb <dig> is essential for assembly of the t4ss translocon and the interaction of virb <dig> with virb <dig> and virb <dig> is crucial for the stabilization  <cit> . we identified all these rest of  <dig> proteins can promote the transfer of peib <dig> . these data suggest that the chromosome- encoded proteins might be involved in rescuing the functions of virb <dig> or other two virb proteins when they are missing. the conjugation frequency of peib <dig> decreased significantly in ∆virb <dig> and ∆virb <dig> . all these results provided evidence that this incomplete t4ss is functional and plays an important role in the horizontal transfer of peib <dig>  whether and how the protein substrates could be transferred by the t4ss in peib <dig> should be further illuminated in the future.

besides established t4ss genes, other genes were also revealed to be essential for peib <dig> conjugation transfer. the genes encoding lipoproteins p <dig>  p <dig> and two hypothetical proteins and neighboring the t4ss genes were identified to be essential for peib <dig> transfer . lpqm, a mycobacterial lipoprotein-metalloproteinase, was also required for conjugal dna transfer, while the requirement of lpqm for conjugation is specific to donor strain but not recipient  <cit> . lipoproteins constitute a significant proportion of the cell wall, and may play certain roles in the assembly or function of t4ss and further plasmid transfer. it is anticipated that topa influences conjugation processes in this study. the gene topa encodes topoisomerase i which is an enzyme essential for relaxation of dna during a number of critical cellular process  <cit> . during the process of the plasmid horizontal transfer, topoisomerase i works as an inhibitor, as it breaks and reseals phosphodiester bonds to relax the supercoiled dna. the role of p <dig> encoding a transcriptional repressor in the conjugation transfer remains to be investigated . among all the established mob/tra proteins  <cit> , only p <dig> for mobc and p <dig> for trac were observed to be essential for conjugation transfer, though with less effect as compared to t4ss genes . how t4ss facilitate the mob/tra mediated conjugation processes and their interaction should be further investigated. besides the dna regions encoding specific proteins, some intergenic regions seem also to be required for plasmid maintenance or conjugation transfer. for example, there was no insertion in the regions etae_p015--etae_p <dig> and etae_p033--etae_p <dig> in the input libraries, suggesting their essentiality for the plasmid maintenance or replication in e. pisicicida . while for the region etae_p004-- etae_ p <dig> and etae_p007-- etae_ p <dig>  the no insertion may be resulted from the polar effect for the t4ss gene expression or they are the dna regions for origin of transfer  per se . in addition to the above-mentioned plasmid genes or dna regions, esrb was intriguingly identified to control the plasmid conjugation transfer . esra-esrb is the two-component system essential for intracellular survival in e. piscicida  <cit> , and plays a key role in regulating ~ <dig> genes’ expression . however, no plasmid gene controlled by esra-esrb was reported. here, we showed that over half of the peib <dig> genes were induced by esrb, which facilitate the conjugation in part by upregulating the t4ss genes . it should be noted that although esrb expression is significantly higher in the nutrient defined dmem medium than in lb, but high level of esrb expression could also be detected in cells grown in lb  <cit> . we only tested the modulation of peib <dig> genes’ expression by esrb when the cells are growing in lb, the same condition we used for conjugation experiment.

it has been generally assumed that antibiotics promote conjugation  <cit> , while antibiotics of sublethal concentrations can increase the conjugation rate by either activating the excision of transferrable genes from the host chromosome or by inducing the expression of conjugation machinery . there were also conflicting reports regarding whether or not antibiotics promote conjugation. recent study identified that antibiotics of sublethal concentrations do not significantly increase the conjugation efficiency, but dictate antibiotic-mediated selection, which can both promote and suppress conjugation dynamics  <cit> . here, we found that str, tet and cm and their mixture at their sublethal concentrations inhibit the conjugation transfer probably mainly due to the repression of t4ss genes , although the influence of the antibiotics on the recipients’ activities should be further considered in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrated that t4ss is essential for the conjugation transfer of multiple-antibiotic resistant peib <dig> and suggested that antibiotics could affect conjugation processes through modulating t4ss. the results also indicated that the genetic elements in chromosome, especially the horizontally acquired response regulator esrb could also affect the plasmid transfer through modulating the expression of t4ss. our results will improve the understanding of the mechanism of plasmid conjugation processes that facilitate dissemination of antibiotic resistance especially in aquaculture industries.
