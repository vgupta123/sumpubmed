BACKGROUND
female eutherian mammals randomly inactivate one of the two x chromosomes to equilibrate expression between the sexes in somatic cells  <cit> , although species vary in their early development . the time period for the initiation of random xci in mice is during post-implantation, which occurs at approximately  <dig> – <dig>  days post coitum   <cit> . the daughter cells inherit the inactivation pattern after initiation  <cit> .

x chromosome gene silencing has been proposed to be controlled by the x inactivation centre  <cit> . in mice, a 100–500 kb region contains  <dig> vital noncoding genes that are involved in the regulation of x chromosome inactivation   <cit> . xist recruits polycomb repressive complex  <dig>  to form the xist-prc <dig> complex. to initiate xci, the xist-prc <dig> complex spreads along the whole inactive x chromosome in cis and is blocked from binding the active x chromosome by tsix. the comprehensive xist interactome has been unravelled . the complex methylates lysine  <dig> on histone h <dig>  leading to chromatin compaction and other epigenetic modifications  <cit> .

two recent studies revealed the dynamics of xist localization during xci initiation using genetically engineered cell lines. the first study found that xist initially localized on gene-rich islands and then spread to gene-poor domains  <cit> . the second study demonstrated that the xist transfer locations were determined by their spatial proximity to the xist locus rather than based on specific sequences  <cit> . both studies concluded that xist coated the entire x chromosome during xci initiation but was first located at sites scattered on the x chromosome instead of uniformly spreading from its transcription site. another study used allele-specific rna sequencing to investigate the xci initiation dynamics in vitro. by differentiating of between embryonic stem cells, these authors traced gene silencing due to skewed inactivation on x chromosome from parent 129/sv-jae. they found that the genes can be stratified into clusters based on their silencing dynamics and that the early silenced genes had a high frequency of close contact with the xist transcription site  <cit> . a study of cpg island methylation dynamics on the inactive x chromosome in vitro also showed that kinetics of genes varied  <cit> .

however, the in vivo pattern and whether there is a bias for the parental origin of allelic expression exists are unknown because the parental origin of the inactive x chromosome is often artificially assigned in in vitro experiments. most studies on rxci have been conducted on engineered embryonic stem cell lines with either a pre-decided inactive x  or only one x chromosome and with the inactivated cells synchronized by inducing differentiation. although a study discussed whether the in vitro reflected the physiological dynamics in vivo, the result was based on a few genes instead of a genome-wide scale  <cit> . moreover, the time of inactivation of the x chromosome varies from hours to days in different cell lines or using different differentiation methods, which is not in agreement with the situation in vivo. thus, whether or not the process represented a real random process should be evaluated.

to investigate the dynamics of rxci in vivo, we used single-cell transcriptomes of embryos from a natural intercrossing of two genetically distant mouse strains. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to explore rxci dynamics in vivo.

RESULTS
experimental procedure
two genetically distant mouse strains  were intercrossed in the study. we used only the female embryos. rxci occurs early during the development of the female embryo   <cit> . to validate the rxci stages of the crossed progenies, we detected xist expression by rna fluorescent in situ hybridization . the percentages of cells with xist clouds at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  dpc were  <dig>   <dig> and 90%, respectively . the fisher’s exact test and chi-square test showed significant differences between neighbouring stages, suggesting that it was proper to choose female embryos at  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  dpc to investigate the rxci dynamics.table  <dig> numbers of cells with xist clouds at three developmental stages, as detected by rna-fish

the fisher’s exact test showed significant differences between  <dig>  dpc and  <dig>  dpc 

the chi-square test showed significant differences between  <dig>  dpc and  <dig>  dpc 




after isolation and dissociation of the natural mating f <dig> female embryos , we randomly picked  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> single cells from embryonic ectoderms collected from  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  dpc embryos, respectively. to obtain sufficient samples, the  <dig>  dpc cells were collected from five embryos, whereas the  <dig>  dpc and  <dig>  dpc cells were collected from a single embryo per age. the transcriptomes of these cells were sequenced using the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform. the work flow is shown in fig. 1a. the embryo genders were determined by pcr prior to single-cell capture and were validated by the mean expression of sex chromosomes using the rna sequencing data. there were approximately  <dig>  million single nucleotide polymorphisms  genome-wide and approximately  <dig>  million snps on the x chromosome between the mouse strains used in this study. these snps can be used to provide allele-specific information to distinguish from which parental allele the transcript arose.fig.  <dig> experimental procedure and pca of single cell transcriptomes. a the work flow of single-cell rna sequencing from natural mating f <dig> female embryos. b fifty single-cell transcriptomes projected onto two principal components




the sequencing data were analysed using the snp-tolerant mapper gsnap. the following criteria were used to ensure reliable read information:  the reads contained only concordant unique mapping and  reads hitting both c <dig> and pwk were excluded. during these developmental stages, 88% of all expressed genes were observed to contain ≥  <dig> allele-specific snps . principal component analysis  was performed on the single-cell transcriptomes  and showed that the cells clustered similar to the developmental stages.

the inactive x chromosome was randomly chosen in vivo
a parameter d was defined to represent the degree of monoallelic expression of each gene. the maternal percentages of gene expression were calculated for both the autosomal and x chromosomal genes in different stages. if the gene is biallelically expressed instead of one allele from a parent being inactivated, d will be  <dig>  if the gene is exclusively expressed from the maternal chromosome, d will be − <dig>  if the gene is exclusively expressed from the paternal chromosome, d will be  <dig>  to minimize the chance that a monoallelically expressed gene was counted due to randomness, the parameter d was only calculated for genes with a total number of allele-specific hits greater than ten. additionally, the differences in d between autosomal genes and x chromosomal genes were examined by the wilcoxon rank-sum test for each cell to exclude cells that were not in the process of rxci . forty cells showed significant differences in d between autosomes and the x chromosome .

by hierarchical cluster analysis , we identified  <dig> cells with maternal x-chromosome inactivation  and  <dig> cells with paternal x-chromosome inactivation  at  <dig>  dpc. the frequency of ma-xci was  <dig> . ma-xci occurred in  <dig> cells and pa-xci occurred in  <dig> cells at  <dig>  dpc. thus, the frequency of ma-xci was  <dig> . ma-xci occurred in  <dig> cells and pa-xci occurred in  <dig> cells at  <dig>  dpc. thus, the frequency of ma-xci was  <dig> . the results obtained for  <dig>  dpc were a bit unexpected. however, the choice of xi at  <dig>  dpc was statistically in line with a bernoulli trial . xi was randomly chosen from the maternal or paternal x chromosome in vivo in this study.

rxci showed heterogeneity within a single developmental stage at the single-cell level
to examine the rxci stages during the different developmental stages, d values were calculated for both autosomal and x chromosomal genes. the average d of the autosomal genes was close to  <dig> in all three developmental stages, indicating that both alleles of the autosomal genes were expressed. in contrast, the average d of the x chromosomal genes ranged from − <dig> to  <dig> . few cells at  <dig>  dpc were close to − <dig> or  <dig> . this result indicated that  <dig>  dpc is an early time for rxci, which was consistent with the rna-fish experiment results. the values were close to − <dig> and  <dig> for 90% of the cells at  <dig>  dpc and 50% of the cells at  <dig>  dpc, indicating that one of the two x chromosomes in these cells was inactivated. the degrees of monoallelic expression at  <dig>  and  <dig>  dpc were high in the single-cell data. however, there were more cells between − <dig> and  <dig> at  <dig>  dpc than at  <dig>  dpc. therefore, it was not suitable to divide the rxci stages by the time due to the heterogeneity within the same developmental stage.fig.  <dig> the expression levels of different stages. a the average d of autosomal genes for each cell. b the average d of x chromosomal genes for each cell. c the percentage of inactive genes for fifty cells in an increasing order. the dotted line divided the forty cells into incomplete rxci and complete rxci. the red dots represented cells that were ma-xci, the green dots represented cells that were pa-xci, and the white dots represented cells that were non-rxci. d the normalized rpkm values of xist for the different rxci stages




genes with an absolute d value greater than  <dig>  were defined as inactive genes. the percentages of inactive x chromosomal genes in each cell varied during the rxci process . the cells could apparently be divided into two different rxci stages: incomplete rxci and complete rxci. twelve cells fell into the incomplete rxci group and  <dig> cells were in the complete rxci group by hierarchical cluster analysis . the dividing line was approximately 85%. the heterogeneity of rxci was not due to differences in the cell cycle distribution .

to confirm the division of rxci stages, the normalized rpkm of xist was calculated for the different rxci stages . xist expression was highest in the complete rxci cells and lowest in the non-rxci cells, although the differences among the three stages were not significant .

a large proportion of genes were inactivated in order
to investigate the dynamics of gene silencing on the x chromosome, the x chromosomal genes were classified into four sets according to their inactivation order . the definition and details of the gene inactivation sets are provided in the methods. genes with more than  <dig> total hits from the paternal or maternal x chromosome that were expressed in more than half of the incomplete rxci cells in the groups were included in the following analysis. the genes in the early inactivation set were monoallelically expressed in both the incomplete rxci cells and the complete rxci cells. the genes in the mid-inactivation set were monoallelically expressed in the complete rxci cells but not the incomplete rxci cells at all the time. the genes in the late inactivation set tended to be monoallelically expressed only in the complete rxci cells. finally, the genes in the non-silenced set were biallelically expressed even in the complete rxci cells; these genes were the candidates of escape genes.fig.  <dig> dynamics of x chromosomal gene silencing. a the gene cluster in ma-xci; the cells were ordered by the proportion of inactive genes. the colour represented the d value for each gene in each cell. white represented a missing value. b the gene cluster in pa-xci, with similar annotations. c, d, e expression levels of genes measured by the means of normalized rpkms  in the early and late inactivation sets during the non-rxci stage, incomplete rxci stage and complete rxci stage, respectively




there were a total of  <dig> and  <dig> genes in the maternal and paternal inactivation sets, respectively. the  <dig> genes included in both parental origin inactivation sets were analysed to reveal the differences between ma-xci and pa-xci . interestingly, 38% of the genes were assigned to the same inactivation set in ma-xci and pa-xci. this proportion increased to 59% when only genes assigned to the early or late inactivation set were considered, indicating that a large proportion of the genes were inactivated in a certain order, regardless of whether the inactive x chromosome was maternal or paternal. we performed  <dig> random samplings for the genes in the early and late inactivation sets to test the tendency of ordered inactivation. the proportion of genes with the same inactivation order in both ma-xci and pa-xci as we observed was significantly higher than in the random samplings . the  <dig> early inactive genes both in ma-xci and pa-xci were not enriched in any gene ontology  terms. however, prps <dig>  hsd17b <dig>  siah1b and naa <dig> all encoded proteins related to biosynthetic processes. the  <dig> common late inactive genes were enriched in the function term “rna binding” in the go enrichment analysis . the ribonucleoprotein binding gene rbm <dig> encoded protein has been reported to be the direct xist partner  <cit> . these findings suggest that the biallelic expression of these genes in the early rxci stage may be important because rxci is regulated by multiple rnas. the inactivation order of the genes has also been classified in an in vitro study, with most of the overlapping genes in our study in the “intermediate” and “late” sets  <cit> . one explanation for this result is that the start time in the previous study was earlier than our start time.

the normalized expression levels of the common genes in the early and late inactivation sets were examined. as expected, the expression levels of the late inactivated genes were higher than those of early inactivated genes in the incomplete rxci cells . the pattern continued in the complete rxci cells . we traced the expression levels of the genes in the non-rxci stage and found that the expression levels of the late inactivated genes were higher from the start , suggesting that expression level may be another important factor that contributes to the gene inactivation order.

the locations of the inactive genes in different inactivation sets in vivo
four genes in the early inactivation set and  <dig> genes in the late inactivation set in ma-xci were assigned to the opposite sets in pa-xci. few functional characteristics of these genes showed a link to the sex chromosomes. whether the inconsistencies of the remaining  <dig> genes were produced by sampling bias or suggested a different preferential inactivation order between ma-xci and pa-xci was unclear. however, it was remarkable that the locations of the two groups of genes on the x chromosome were very close. one group included pdzd <dig>  lage <dig>  fundc <dig>  and brcc <dig>  and the second included bex <dig>  bex <dig>  and acsl <dig>  one possible explanation is that genes located in close proximity are likely to be inactivated at a similar time.

to investigate the rxci dynamics, we examined the locations of  <dig> genes. the gene locations in the same inactivation set highly overlapped in ma-xci and pa-xci . this finding supported the hypothesis that there was no different general preferential inactivation pattern between ma-xci and pa-xci. although the locations of the genes among the three sets showed a spreading trend of expansion from gene-rich to gene-poor regions compared with the early inactivation set and the mid-inactivation set, the difference was not significant . rxci was believed to be initiated in gene-rich regions and it could continue all the time in the gene-rich regions to ensure complete inactivation of the regions. the genes in the early inactivation set were not closer to the x-inactivation centre  than the genes in the other sets in either ma-xci or pa-xci, which was different from the results of a previous in vitro study  <cit> . our results supported the hypothesis that xist coated the entire x chromosome but was first located at sites scattered on the chromosome instead of spreading uniformly from its transcription site during xci initiation. the distances between x chromosomal genes to xic ranged from  <dig> to 50 mb on average in each inactivation set. the interactions between xist and the genes in the three sets were calculated using hi-c data from mouse embryonic stem cells  <cit> . the data showed no significant differences among the different inactivation sets in both ma-xci and pa-xci .fig.  <dig> the locations of genes within the inactivation sets on the x chromosome. each dot represented the location of a gene. the gene density on the x chromosome was indicated with a colour bar





new escape genes found in vivo were homologous to human escape genes
to confirm that the genes from the non-silenced set were escape genes, we filtered genes on the x chromosome as previously described  <cit>  with a modification to increase the stringency of our single-cell data. briefly, genes that were expressed in at least 10% of the inactive x versus the total active x and inactive x were considered to be escape genes. we identified a total of nine candidate escape genes . among them, we identified six previously reported escape genes   <cit> , and two novel ones, lpar <dig> and rp136a. xist was also correctly identified as a transcript expressed at a high level in the inactive x.

the six reported escape genes except utp14a were identified in both ma-xci and pa-xci, when analysed separately. utp14a, pqbp <dig>  ogt, and lpar <dig> were only identified in ma-xci, whereas rp136a was only identified in pa-xci.

snps of these genes were determined by sanger sequencing of the amplified fragment from cdna of cells at  <dig> dpc to validate the candidate escape genes. pqbp <dig>  kdm5c, rpl36a, 5530601h04rik and ddx3x were confirmed to be escape genes . a homologous gene in human of pqbp <dig> has previously been reported to be escape gene  <cit> . in all, we newly identified two escape genes, rpl36a and pqbp <dig> 

testing dosage compensation during the post-implantation stages
next, we investigated dosage compensation in mouse post-implantation embryos. susumu ohno presumed twofold upregulation of x chromosomal genes to maintain balance between x chromosomal and autosomal gene expression levels in mammalian cells  <cit> . although recent studies have not detected widespread upregulation of x chromosomal genes in several organs of adult placental mammals  <cit> , it remains unclear whether there is widespread upregulation during the initiation of rxci. genes with one-to-one orthologs in chickens were included. we focused only on highly expressed genes with the same percentages on the x chromosome and autosomes as previously discussed  <cit> . the embryo underwent rxci during the post-implantation stages. we discovered significant expression differences between the x chromosome and autosomes in most cells . the x:aa ratio decreased with the advance of the rxci stage and was close to  <dig>  in the complete rxci stage . these results suggested that the active x chromosome was not up-regulated to balance the x-to-autosome ratio during rxci.fig.  <dig> expression ratio between the x chromosome and autosomes of cells in different rxci stages




discussion
we exhibited the high resolution dynamics of rxci in vivo in this study using single-cell rna sequencing of the crossed progenies of two genetically distant mouse strains. instead of assigning the parental origin of xi artificially, in this study xi was randomly assigned from the natural developmental stages.

interestingly, the rxci process in the cells was heterogeneous even within a single developmental stage, indicating that rxci is not a synchronized step in vivo as shown in the assay of engineered embryonic stem cells in vitro . the rxci of different cell types may occur at different time point as the cells differentiate from embryonic stem cells into the three germ layers. the general trend was consistent with previous reports. the  <dig>  dpc cells were in the non-rxci and incomplete rxci stages, which was the early time of the rxci process. the total cell number in the embryonic ectoderm  <dig>  dpc was sixty-fold higher than the number of cells at  <dig>  dpc and ten-fold higher than the number of cells at  <dig>  dpc  <cit> . the exponential increase in the cell number and the various cell types present at  <dig>  dpc may explain the large heterogeneity in the rxci degree observed at  <dig>  dpc. these results are a reminder that distinguishing the rxci stage by days is not precise and that more cells should be sampled in future studies.

the inactivation order of the x chromosomal genes was determined for both the maternal and paternal xi. generally, we did not observe a parental origin bias for the inactivation order. instead, the inactivation order of genes was associated with their functions. multiple non-coding rnas, such as xist, xite, and repa, are recognized to regulate the rxci process. genes related to rna binding, such as rps4x, rbm <dig>  and eif1ax, were in the late inactivation set. it suggested that genes in the late inactivation set may play roles in the early time of rxci, while the genes in the earlier sets may not. the functions of genes in the early inactivation set also supported this view. in addition to the functions of the x chromosomal genes, their expression levels may also influence the inactivation order.

although the inactivation order of a number of genes differed between the maternal and parental origins, their locations on the x chromosome were not significantly different. therefore, we propose that the randomness of rxci is primarily reflected in the random parental origin choice of xi; the inactivation order of genes is determined by their functions, expression levels, and locations; within this context, small randomness is allowed for the different parental origin. because our data were obtained by rna sequencing, only the transcripts were captured, and other regions on the x chromosome were not included. this limitation may explain why the two-step manner of rxci initiations previously reported using sequences obtained from rna antisense purification or capture hybridization analysis of rna targets with deep sequencing could not be detected  <cit> . moreover, the number of captured genes in allele-specific analyses on the x chromosome was around  <dig> for each single cell in our study, which prevented our ability to deeply analyse the incomplete rxci stage.

mice have been reported to possess relatively fewer escape genes than humans. a total of 15% of x chromosomal genes escape x inactivation in humans, whereas  <dig> % of x chromosomal genes have been estimated to escape x inactivation in the mouse  <cit> . most of these genes are related to brain functions  <cit> . for instance, kdm5c plays a vital role in brain development in the mouse, and a mutant kdm5c of its homologous gene in human can lead to mental retardation, epilepsy and autistic spectrum disorder . in addition to xist and the reported escape genes, we newly found two escape genes. among them, pqbp <dig> was homologous to human escape genes, indicating that there may be more escape genes in the mouse than expected. there are many ways to test dosage compensation, and most recent studies have been based on whole-transcriptome analysis. the comparison of expression levels between x chromosomal genes and autosomal genes was only meaningful in sex chromosome evolution, that the ancestral x chromosome is represented by present-day autosomes  <cit> . so we only evaluated one-to-one orthologs. finally, our data refuted ohno’s hypothesis of dosage compensation. the x:aa ratio was not upregulated during the post-implantation stages in the mouse.

CONCLUSIONS
random x-chromosome inactivation is a general process to maintain of normal somatic cell functions in female placental mammals such as human and mouse. it is unclear whether the origin of the inactive x chromosome has any substantive effect. here, we used mouse embryos obtained from a natural intercrossing of two genetically distant mouse strains. by single-cell rna sequencing, the differences of gene expression between maternal and paternal inactive x chromosome became comparable. we found the inactivation orders of x chromosomal genes were determined by their own properties. generally, the inactivation order did not exhibit a parental origin preference. two new escape genes were identified, one of which was homologous to a human escape gene. ohno’s hypothesis of dosage compensation was refuted by our mouse post-implantation stage data. these findings are important as it provided insights into the gene silencing dynamics during random x-chromosome inactivation in vivo for the first time.
