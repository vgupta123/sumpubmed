BACKGROUND
toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular pathogen from the phylum apicomplexa and is estimated to infect about one third of the world population  <cit> . it usually establishes an asymptomatic, chronic infection, but immunodeficient individuals can develop severe disease such as encephalitis and retinitis. toxoplasma has a relatively complex life cycle, containing both asexual and sexual stages. the sexual cycle occurs in felines, but because a single parasite can give rise to both micro and macro-gametes, usually self fertilization occurs  <cit> . sexual recombination leading to new genotypes can only occur when felines are infected simultaneously with at least two different strains  <cit> . the low occurrence of concurrent infection events, together with horizontal transmission between intermediate hosts through consumption of infectious cysts, likely accounts for the highly clonal population structure observed in north america and europe  <cit> .

in north america, three clonal lineages known as types i, ii and iii were thought to predominate  <cit> . however, recent snp analysis at five loci in ~ <dig> strains, representing worldwide diversity, clustered these strains into  <dig> haplogroups and showed a high prevalence of type  <dig> strains in north america  <cit> , while a large number of divergent strains are present in south america. using genome-wide snps, it was shown that even within these haplogroups , there is often significant diversity and most strains appear to have formed through recent recombination events  <cit> . between lineage diversity is estimated to be  <dig> to 3% while diversity within the type i, ii and iii clonal lineage is ~ <dig> %  <cit> . there are also strong phenotypic differences between lineages  <cit> , such as acute virulence in mice, with type i strains being uniformly lethal , while types ii and iii are less virulent, with ld <dig> ≥  <dig> and ld <dig> ≥  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . another phenotype that has been correlated with virulence is in vitro growth rate, with type i parasites having a higher growth rate compared to types ii and iii  <cit> .

rh is the most commonly used type i strain for characterization of numerous aspects of toxoplasma biology, ranging from active invasion, replication, to host cell egress, and it has been used extensively for molecular genetic analyses. rh was initially isolated from a  <dig> case of toxoplasmic encephalitis by albert sabin and was subsequently cloned by elmer pfefferkorn for in vitro culture in  <dig>  <cit> . this cloned rh-erp strain has likely undergone laboratory adaptation due to extensive in vitro lab passage, unlike rh-jsr, a non-cloned rh isolate that was propagated in mice and has undergone little serial passage in culture  <cit> . there are several other isolates of the type i lineage defined by pcr-rflp at multiple marker alleles, such as gt <dig>  an isolate from goat skeletal muscle  <cit> , from which the complete genome has been sequenced   <cit> .

surprisingly, rh-erp displays significant parasite phenotypic variation compared to gt <dig> and rh-jsr  <cit> , with rh-erp having increased extracellular survival times, higher in vitro growth rates and loss of ability to form orally infective cysts  <cit> . moreover, using toxoplasma microarrays, it was observed that rh-erp parasite gene expression is significantly different compared to rh-jsr and gt <dig>  <cit> , with upregulation of certain abc transporters in rh-erp compared to rh-jsr or gt <dig>  rh-erp and gt <dig> also differ in the modulation of certain host processes; a serum response factor  reporter cell line is activated more by rh-erp compared to gt <dig>  and transcript levels of early growth response factor  <dig> , a srf target gene, are higher upon rh-erp infection compared to gt <dig>  <cit> . in addition, there is increased immune related gtpase  coating of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane  of gt <dig> compared to rh-erp in ifn-γ stimulated mouse embryonic fibroblasts  and subsequent higher levels of gt <dig> killing compared to rh-erp  <cit> . differential modulation of host pathways could affect host cell survival or nutritional availability and subsequent toxoplasma replication within the host cell.

the genetic basis for phenotypic variation between rh-erp and the other type i strains is currently unknown. many of these phenotypic differences are important determinants of acute virulence and chronic infection, as increased growth rates can lead to higher parasite burdens in vivo, and cyst formation is essential for toxoplasma transmission  <cit> . thus, understanding the genetic basis for the enhanced growth rate of rh-erp and its inability to form orally infectious cysts could provide important insights into toxoplasma virulence determinants. to examine the potential genetic basis for phenotypic differences between rh-erp and gt <dig>  we compared the complete genome sequences of rh-erp and gt <dig> and identified single nucleotide polymorphisms  and insertions/deletions  across the genome. we also compared differential parasite gene expression between rh-erp and rh-jsr/gt <dig> through our own independent transcriptional profiling and previous studies  <cit> . using our snp/indel and differentially expressed gene list, we then identified a number of candidate genes that could be responsible for the phenotypic differences observed between rh-erp and rh-jsr/gt <dig>  including a dense granule protein, gra <dig>  we then attributed the differences between rh-erp and gt <dig> in evasion of ifn-γ-mediated killing in mefs to gra <dig>  to identify novel differences in host cell modulation among type i strains, we performed transcriptional profiling of human foreskin fibroblasts  infected with rh-erp, rh-jsr and gt <dig>  several host pathways were found to be differentially modulated, such as the nf-κb pathway, which is activated by gt <dig> but not by rh-erp or rh-jsr. other host phenotypes that were different across type i strains included il-12p <dig>  secretion by infected macrophages and recruitment of p-iκbα to the pvm, which was partially dependent on gra <dig>  our results show that genetic mutations accumulated over time due to continuous laboratory passaging, can lead to large phenotypic changes and the candidate genes identified can serve as a guideline for future studies in examining phenotypic differences among type i strains.

methods
parasites and cells
human foreskin fibroblasts  were grown in dmem  supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fbs ,  <dig> μg/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, and  <dig> μg/ml gentamycin. a hek293t stable reporter cell line with four copies of the nf-κb consensus transcriptional response element driving the expression of gfp and luciferase  were grown in the same dmem but supplemented with  <dig> mm sodium pyruvate,  <dig> μm mem nonessential amino acids and  <dig> mm hepes. these nf-κb 293t reporter cells were passed every 2– <dig> days using  <dig> % trypsin-edta  <cit> . c57bl/6j mouse embryonic fibroblasts  were a gift from a. sinai  and grown in hff media supplemented with  <dig> mm hepes. parasites were maintained in vitro by serial passage on monolayers of hffs at 37°c in 5% co <dig>  rh-erp is a clone of the original rh isolate, subjected to continuous passage in vitro until the time of present study. rh-jsr was a gift from david sibley  and is a noncloned line of the original rh isolate, subjected to propagation in mice and cryopreserved since  <dig>  gt <dig> was originally isolated from skeletal muscle of a goat in  <dig>  and was subject to passage in laboratory conditions  <cit> .

reagents
all tissue culture reagents were purchased from gibco , unless otherwise stated. antibodies against toxoplasma dense granule protein gra <dig> were kindly provided by john boothroyd   <cit> . anti-mouse p-iκbα , anti-human nf-κb p <dig>  and anti-mouse tgtp  antibodies were purchased from santa cruz biotechnology . recombinant human tnfα was obtained from invitrogen , and lipopolysaccharide was purchased from emd millipore .

generation of transgenic parasites
to generate rh-erp  parasites expressing the gt <dig> allele of gra <dig>  the gra <dig> coding region and putative promoter  was amplified from gt <dig> genomic dna by pcr . sequence coding for a c terminal ha tag was included in the reverse primer . gra15gt1ha was then cloned into pentrd/d-topo , and into ptko-att  <cit>  through lr recombination . the ptko-att-gra15gt1ha vector was then linearized by digestion with xhoi . linearized vector was transfected into rh-erp∆hxgprt by electroporation as previously described  <cit> . stable integrants were selected in media with  <dig> μg/ml mycophenolic acid  and  <dig> μg/ml xanthine  and cloned by limiting dilution. immunofluorescence was used to confirm expression of gra15gt <dig> via ha staining.

to generate rh∆gra <dig> parasites complemented with either rh-erp gra <dig> or gt <dig> gra <dig>  the gra <dig> coding region and putative promoter  was amplified from rh-erp  and gt <dig> genomic dna by pcr . sequence coding for the attp4r recombination site was included in the forward primer and a c terminal ha tag was included in the reverse primer . a second pcr added the attp <dig> recombination site after the ha tag and the insert was cloned into pdonr  <dig> p4r-p3r  using bp recombination . the gra2-ha insert was then flanked by the genomic dna both upstream and downstream of the uprt locus and inserted into the ptko <dig> destination vector  <cit>  by lr recombination . ptko2-gra2ha was linearized by digestion with hindiii  which does not cut within gra <dig> and ptub-cat was digested with noti . ptko2-gra2ha and ptub-cat were co-transfected into rh∆gra <dig> as previously described  <cit> . stable integrants were selected by passage of  <dig> parasites every  <dig> days in  <dig> μm chloramphenicol and cloned by limiting dilution. immunofluorescence and western blot were used to confirm expression of rh-erp gra <dig> or gt <dig> gra <dig> via ha staining.

luciferase assays
hek293t nf-κb reporter cells were seeded at a density of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells per well for  <dig> hours in a black  <dig> well clear bottom plate . parasites were syringed lysed, washed once with pbs and three different multiplicity of infection  per strain were used to infect reporter cells. as a positive control, recombinant human tnfα was used at  <dig> ng/μl to stimulate uninfected cells at the same time as infection. after  <dig> hours of infection, uninfected, stimulated and infected cells were lysed using cell culture lysis reagent, and luciferase activity in lysates was measured according to manufacturer’s protocol . data from cells infected with similar mois, as determined by plaque assay, were used.

in vitro cytokine elisas
c57bl/ <dig> bone marrow-derived macrophages  were isolated as described  <cit> , and plated in dmem, supplemented with 20% l <dig> supernatants, two days before infection. parasites were syringe lysed, washed once with pbs and three different mois per strain were used to infect uninfected macrophages. as a positive control, purified lipopolysaccharide  was used to stimulate uninfected bmms  <dig> hours before supernatants were collected. after  <dig> hours of infection, supernatants from uninfected, stimulated and infected cells were collected and stored at −80°c until elisas were performed. il-12/23p <dig> and ccl2/mcp- <dig> levels in culture supernatants were determined using commercially available elisa kits , according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

immunofluorescence
irgb <dig> staining in mefs were performed as previously described  <cit> . percent irgb <dig> coating was determined in a blind fashion by finding intracellular parasites and then scoring irgb <dig> coating as positive or negative. for p <dig> and p-iκbα staining, hffs were plated on coverslips in  <dig> well plates until confluent, and subsequently infected with parasites for different timepoints. hffs were then fixed with 3%  formaldehyde in pbs for  <dig> min at room temperature, permeabilized with  <dig> %  triton x- <dig> in pbs, and blocked in pbs with 3%  bsa and 5%  goat serum. coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°c, and fluorescent secondary antibodies, coupled with alexa fluor  <dig> or  <dig> , and hoechst dye were used for antigen and dna visualization, respectively. coverslips were mounted on a glass slide with vectashield  and photographs were taken using nis-elements software  and a digital camera  connected to an inverted fluorescence microscope .

quantification of p <dig> nuclear localization was performed as previously described  <cit> . quantification of p-iκbα localized to the pvm was performed using nis-elements software . parasitophorous vacuoles  were chosen at random through gra <dig> staining. the intensity of fluorescent p- iκbα was measured by drawing two lines at right angles across the long and short axes of the vacuoles, and intensity profiles were obtained for each line. the fold change intensity of each line was taken by dividing the highest peak value where each line crossed the margins of the pvm by the lowest value for each line . the signal intensity for each vacuole was given as the mean of the two intensity fold changes obtained per vacuole.

plaque assays
plaque assays were set up as previously described  <cit> . briefly, mefs were seeded the day before, and stimulated with  <dig> u/ml mouse ifnγ or left unstimulated before infection in a  <dig> well plate. plaques were then counted in unstimulated and stimulated mefs after incubation for 4– <dig> days at 37°c.

snp and indel list generation between rh-erp and gt1
to reduce the posibility of sequence errors and cell line specific mutations, genomic dna from two related rh-erp lines, 2f-1-yfp <dig> parent and an f-p <dig> enu mutagenized child, were prepared and sequenced  <cit> . illumina sequencing produced  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads for the parent and f-p <dig> samples respectively. the fastq sequence traces were aligned to a fasta reference containing both toxoplasma gondii gt <dig> genomic reference v <dig>  and the human genome reference build  <dig>  reads were aligned to the gt <dig> genome as well as the human genome to filter out any possible human contamination. mosaik v <dig>  was used to perform the alignments using the standard parameters. greater than 90% of the reads aligned for each sample, with rougly half of the reads filtered out as human contamination. variants were called using the variant caller freebayes  <cit>  using standard parameters, software version  <dig> . <dig>  varations were then filtered to identify variants that were called in both parental and f-p <dig> samples at an allele balance greater than 75%.

rh-erp and gt <dig> gene expression via rna-seq
rna was isolated from c57bl/ <dig> bone marrow derived macrophages infected with rh-erp and gt <dig>  these were processed and sequenced as described previously  <cit> . reads were then mapped to the gt <dig> genome .

toxoplasma microarray analysis
for toxoplasma arrays, image analysis files  files from published microarray data from hffs infected with rh-erp, rh-jsr or gt <dig> were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus  database . in addition, independent toxoplasma arrays were performed on total rna isolated from hffs infected for  <dig> hours with rh-erp, rh-jsr and gt <dig> . each sample was hybridized to the t. gondii affymetrix microarray  <cit> . the image analysis files from gse <dig>  gse <dig> and gse <dig> were all processed together using the expression console software, normalized using robust multi array  algorithm, and all background values less than  <dig>  were set to  <dig> . these arrays were then imported into multi-experiment viewer   <cit> , all genes were median-centered and loaded into genomica  <cit>  as the array dataset.

to create genomica and gsea custom gene sets to determine biological function enrichment  <cit> , we downloaded the gene ontology  and interpro  annotations for toxoplasma genes using the me <dig> v <dig> reference genome . to determine functional enrichment in groups of genes with similar annotations , gene sets were loaded into genomica  <cit>  and selected as gene sets to analyze. the default parameters were used to run the hypergeometric enrichment analysis .

human microarray analysis
hffs were grown in  <dig> well plates until confluency was reached. parasites were syringe lysed and washed once with pbs. hffs were infected with rh-erp, rh-jsr and gt <dig> at three different mois for  <dig> hours. plaque assays were done to assess viability of parasites and infections with similar mois were chosen. three biological replicates were done for rh-erp and rh-jsr while two biological replicates were done for gt <dig>  trizol reagent  was used to isolate total rna according to the manufacturer’s instructions and rna was cleaned up using minielute kit . rna was labeled and hybridized to human affymetrix arrays  according to manufacturer’s protocol. probe intensities were measured with the affymetrix genechip scanner  <dig> 7g and were processed into image analysis  files with expression console software , which can be accessed through geo . intensity values were normalized using rma through expression console, and all background values less than  <dig>  were set to  <dig> .

gsea was used to find candidate transcription factors and canonical pathways that were modulated differently between the type i toxoplasma strains  <cit> . both transcription factor and canonical pathway gene sets from the molecular signatures database  were used to determine enrichment , using default parameters except the range of set size, which was changed to a minimum of  <dig> and maximum of  <dig>  analysis of distant regulatory elements of coregulated genes   <cit>  was performed using a random set of  <dig> background genes and using target elements of top  <dig> evolutionary conserved regions  and promoter ecrs. for every gene in a list, dire detects regulatory elements throughout the entire gene locus and looks for enrichment of transcription factor binding sites.

RESULTS
identification of genetic differences between rh-erp and gt1
to determine the genetic differences between rh-erp and gt <dig>  we sequenced rh-erp using illumina sequencing and downloaded the complete genome sequence of gt <dig> . a list of single nucleotide polymorphisms  and insertions/deletions  between rh-erp and gt <dig> was generated, and a total number of  <dig>  snps and indels were identified. there were  <dig> snps/indels within predicted coding regions,  <dig> snps/indels within predicted genes but outside coding regions, and  <dig> snps/indels outside predicted genes. from the  <dig> snp/indels within predicted coding regions, we further identified  <dig> snps leading to nonsynonymous amino acid changes,  <dig> snps leading to synonymous amino acid substitutions, and  <dig> indels within predicted coding regions .

 details for genome sequencing of rh-erp parental and rh-erp f-p <dig> mutant, where common variants between these two strains were determined as snps/indels between rh-erp and gt <dig>   total number of single nucleotide polymorphisms  and insertions/deletions  identified between rh-erp and gt <dig>  with the number of snps/indels identified in each category as indicated.  top three functional enrichment of nonsynonymous snps and indels present in gene coding regions, together with genes which contain snp/indels  <dig> bp upstream of predicted atg start, using hypergeometric enrichment.

we then determined whether there was functional enrichment in the genes containing the  <dig>  snps/indels. genes with nonsynonymous snps and indels within coding regions were enriched in 3′5′ cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, protein kinase, atp binding and metal ion binding activities . genes with snp/indels within  <dig> bp upstream of predicted atg start were enriched in nucleoside triphosphatase, nucleotide binding and atpase activities  . interestingly, addition of a cgmp-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, zaprinast, has been shown to induce toxoplasma egress from host cells  <cit> . moreover, deletion of phosphodiesterase δ in a related apicomplexan, plasmodium berghei, caused severe defects in formation of normal ookinetes and ookinete gliding motility  <cit> . thus, it is possible that the phosphodiesterases that have nonsynonymous snps and/or indels could contribute to differences in growth rate of rh-erp compared to gt <dig> 

rh-erp tachyzoites grow faster, have higher extracellular viability and loss in ability to form orally infectious cysts compared to gt1/rh-jsr tachyzoites  <cit> . thus, these phenotypic differences are likely due to parasite genes that are polymorphic and/or differentially expressed between rh-erp and gt <dig>  we used our snp/indel data and toxoplasma gene expression data to identify candidate genes, focusing on genes that have non-synonymous, non-conservative snps and/or are differentially expressed between rh-erp and rh-jsr/gt <dig> 

analysis of genes with polymorphisms in coding regions between rh-erp and gt1
from the list of  <dig> nonsynonymous snps, we identified  <dig> snps which led to non-conservative amino acid changes. we then identified  <dig> snps in genes which had transcript levels expressed above background levels of  <dig>  in rh-erp tachyzoites through toxoplasma array data  <cit> , and identified several candidate genes which could lead to differences in phenotypes between rh-erp and gt <dig> . the gene encoding for dense granule protein gra <dig>  was found to have a glycine  to serine  substitution, and was expressed highly in both rh-erp and gt <dig> from array data. rhΔgra <dig> differs in several phenotypes compared to parental rh-erp , such as the disruption of the intravacuolar network within the pv, decreased virulence in mice and enhanced susceptibility to irg-mediated killing  <cit> .

 candidate genes that have non-conservative, nonsynonymous amino acid changes between rh-erp and gt <dig> and are expressed highly in rh-erp as determined by toxoplasma arrays. toxoplasma array expression values are log <dig> transformed values, ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>  .  candidate genes that are differentially expressed between intracellular and extracellular rh-erp tachyzoites  <cit> .  candidate genes that are differentially expressed between m <dig> in vitro tachyzoites, in vitro induced bradyzoites and in vivo cysts  <cit> .

interestingly, an atp-dependent rna helicase  contained one conservative and two non-conservative nonsynonymous snps, indicating possible positive selection in this gene and was highly expressed in rh-erp and gt <dig> from array and rnaseq data . rna helicases of the dead box family are involved in multiple aspects of rna metabolism, ranging from formation of the exon junction complex, mrna export and translation initiation  <cit> . interestingly, eif4a, the model of dead helicases, has been shown to be downregulated at the transcript level in attenuated type i tachyzoites  and type ii bradyzoites compared to virulent type i tachyzoites  <cit> .

in addition, srs29a and srs29c both had a non-conservative, nonsynonymous amino acid substitution, and were highly expressed in both rh-erp and gt <dig> in array data. srs29a was also  <dig>  fold more highly expressed in rh-erp extracellular tachyzoites compared to rh-erp intracellular tachyzoites . a recent study showed that rh-erp overexpressing srs29c was significantly attenuated in mouse virulence compared to parental rh-erp strain, though this overexpressing strain did not have any significant differences from the parental strain with regards to invasion, attachment or growth in vitro <cit> .

another candidate gene identified was gap <dig> , with a isoleucine  to asparagine  substitution and was highly expressed in both rh-erp and gt <dig> in array data . gap <dig> is the membrane anchor of the glideosome complex, which is required for gliding motility  <cit> . it also interacts with other components such as tgmyoa, tgmlc <dig> and tggap <dig>  and requires n-glycosylation for proper localization to the inner membrane complex  <cit> . interestingly, a rhoptry neck protein, ron <dig> , has an aspartic acid  to glycine  substitution, and is  <dig>  fold more highly expressed in rh-erp compared to gt <dig> in rnaseq data . ron <dig> has a distinct rhoptry neck localization  <cit> , and several rhoptry neck proteins constitute the moving junction, which is required for invasion of the host cell  <cit> . thus, polymorphisms in these genes could account for differences in invasion, growth or extracellular viability between rh-erp and gt <dig> 

we also examined these  <dig> non-conserved, nonsynonymous snps for genes that are differentially expressed between rh-erp intracellular and extracellular tachyzoites  <cit> , as rh-erp has increased extracellular viability compared to gt <dig>  <cit> . we noted a predicted acylamino-acid releasing enzyme  that contained a nonsense mutation leading to a premature stop codon, and had decreased expression in extracellular tachyzoites . in addition, a putative pina gene  with a phenylalanine  to leucine  substitution had increased  <dig>  fold expression in extracellular tachyzoites compared to intracellular tachyzoites. this parasite gene contains a forkhead associated domain that is involved in binding to phosphopeptides and forkhead-type transcription factors are involved in the regulation of cell cycle stage specific transcription in budding yeast  <cit> . thus, these genes could be involved in the difference in extracellular viability reported between rh-erp and gt <dig> 

rh-erp also exhibits a loss in ability to form orally infective cysts, unlike gt <dig>  <cit> . thus, we also examined the  <dig> non-conserved, nonsynonymous snps for parasite genes which are differentially expressed between m <dig>  tachyzoites, m <dig> in vitro bradyzoites and m <dig> in vivo cysts  <cit> . two parasite genes containing substitution polymorphisms between rh-erp and gt <dig> were upregulated in both in vitro bradyzoites and in vivo cysts . one of the genes  contains a glycosyltransferase domain that is involved in transferring n-acetylglucosamine to the core mannose of complex n-glycans. interestingly, tggt1_ <dig> was also identified to be consistently more highly expressed in rh-erp compared to gt <dig> . thus, this gene could potentially be involved in the loss of ability in rh-erp to form orally infectious cysts, as bradyzoites contain numerous amylopectin granules and the tissue cyst wall consists of lectin binding sugars  <cit> .

 candidate genes that have a snp/indel present in  <dig> bp region upstream of predicted atg start or downstream of predicted end codon, and leading to expression differences of ≥ <dig>  fold in toxoplasma arrays.  candidate genes that are consistently differentially expressed between rh-erp and gt <dig> using the three toxoplasma array datasets, but not necessarily containing snps/indels in the 5′ or 3′ utr regions.

rh-erp and gt <dig> gra <dig> both complement irgb <dig> coating but show differences in irg mediated killing
as mentioned above, gra <dig> was found to have a single polymorphism from glycine  to serine  in our snp analysis. furthermore, previous work on toxoplasma immune evasion mechanisms have shown that rh-erp infected ifn-γ stimulated mefs had decreased percentage of parasite vacuoles coated with irgb <dig>  an immunity related gtpase , compared to gt <dig> infected mefs  <cit> . in addition, rhΔgra <dig> infected ifn-γ stimulated mefs had increased percentage of parasite vacuoles coated with irgb <dig> compared to rh-erp infected mefs. thus, we examined the possible effects of the gra <dig> polymorphism on irgb <dig> coating and irg evasion through complementation of rhΔgra <dig> with either rh-erp gra <dig> or gt <dig> gra <dig> 

as noted previously, there was a significant difference between rh-erp and rhΔgra <dig> or gt <dig> in percentage of parasite vacuoles coated with irgb <dig>  and p-value =  <dig>  , student’s t test). both rh-erp gra <dig> and gt <dig> gra <dig> were able to complement irgb <dig> coating, as both complemented strains had similar percentage parasite vacuoles coated with irgb <dig> compared to rh-erp. however, some toxoplasma parasites are still able to survive, escape irg coated vacuoles and invade a new cell, thus irgb <dig> coating may not fully measure parasite killing  <cit> . therefore, to measure ifn-γ mediated killing in mefs, the relative number of parasite plaques that form 4– <dig> days on ifn-γ stimulated mefs compared to unstimulated mefs were measured . surprisingly, unlike irgb <dig> coating, there were differences between the two complemented strains in the plaque loss assay , though both complemented strains expressed similar levels of gra <dig> . the rh-erp gra <dig> was able to complement the difference in plaque loss between rh-erp and rhΔgra <dig>  with no significant difference in plaque loss between rh-erp and rhΔgra2+rh-erp-gra <dig> . however, the gt <dig> gra <dig> was unable to complement the difference in plaque loss, and there was still a significant difference in plaque loss between rh-erp and rhΔgra2+gt1-gra <dig> , similar to the difference observed between rh-erp and gt <dig>  .

it is possible that the difference in complementation observed between rh-erp gra <dig> and gt <dig> gra <dig> in the plaque assay is due to toxoplasma killing in mefs involving other irg family members in addition to irgb <dig>  the different irgs are known to play individual, non-redundant roles during infection, as mice lacking different irgs exhibit susceptibility to toxoplasma infection at different stages of infection  <cit> . furthermore, irgb <dig> coating is likely dependent on proper parasitophorous vacuole biogenesis, which is disrupted in rhΔgra <dig> <cit> , whereas plaque loss is likely not solely dependent on proper pv biogenesis.

identification and analysis of differentially expressed parasite genes among type i strains
in addition to polymorphisms, phenotypic differences between rh-erp and gt <dig> can also be attributed to differential expression of parasite genes among the different type i strains. this differential expression could be due to two main reasons  <cit> . firstly, polymorphisms in the cis-regulatory regions, such as the promoter or untranslated regions , could lead to differences in transcription initiation, transcript stability or transcript decay. secondly, polymorphic or differentially expressed transcriptional regulators, such as the apetala  <dig>  transcription factors  <cit> , could affect the expression levels of non-polymorphic genes. these transcriptional regulators can affect gene expression levels at different levels of rna metabolism, such as controlling the formation of the exon junction complex, the export of mrna through the nuclear complex and translation initiation  <cit> .

since sequence variation in promoter regions between strains could lead to differential gene expression, we determined whether any of the  <dig> snps/indels we identified outside predicted gene coding regions were inside a promoter/5′ utr  or 3′ utr . we found  <dig> snps/indels within the 5′ utr of  <dig> genes and  <dig> snps/indels within the 3′ utr of  <dig> genes. of these  <dig> genes with 5′ or 3′ utr snps/indels, microarray analyses showed that  <dig> genes were ≥ <dig>  fold differentially expressed between rh-erp and gt <dig>  .

we identified a putative dihydrolipoamid dehydrogenase  with a 5′ utr polymorphism, that was expressed  <dig>  fold higher in rh-erp compared to gt <dig> using array data, and was also expressed higher than in other canonical strains such as pru and veg . moreover, this same putative dihydrolipoamid dehydrogenase was expressed approximately  <dig> fold higher in rh-erp intracellular parasites compared to extracellular parasite , which could indicate a possible role in intracellular growth. dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase serves as a component of several multifunctional complexes, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase, the glycine cleavage system and branched chain amino acid dehydrogenase complexes  <cit> . thus, increased expression of this gene in rh-erp could lead to differences in glycolytic metabolism, or resistance to reactive nitrogen intermediates. interestingly, deletion of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase in an intracellular bacterial pathogen, mycobacterium tuberculosis, causes a significant attenuation of virulence in mice  <cit> .

notably, there was a single abc transporter  with a 5′ utr polymorphism, though it was only expressed  <dig>  fold higher in rh-erp compared to gt <dig> using array data. it was shown that cells transfected with tgabcg <dig> accumulated larger amounts of cholesterol in an atp-dependent manner compared to untransfected cells, indicating a role for abcg <dig> in lipid homeostasis in toxoplasma <cit> . in addition, we noted an atp dependent helicase  with a 5′ utr polymorphism that was expressed  <dig>  fold higher in rh-erp compared to gt <dig> using array data . thus, overexpression of these atp dependent candidate genes identified could contribute to the enhanced growth of rh-erp.

interestingly, we identified an ap- <dig> transcription factor  with a 3′ utr polymorphism, and is more highly expressed in m <dig> in vitro bradyzoites and in vivo cysts compared to in vitro tachyzoites  <cit>  .  <dig> ap- <dig> transcription factors have cyclical expression profiles corresponding to the tachyzoite division cycle, whereas  <dig> ap- <dig> mrnas are induced during in vitro bradyzoite differentiation   <cit> . therefore, this ap <dig> transcription factor could be involved in the regulation of genes required for bradyzoite differentiation and cyst formation.

another reason for differential parasite gene expression could be polymorphic or differentially expressed trans-regulators, such as the ap <dig> transcription factors  <cit>  that could regulate the expression of many non-polymorphic genes. alternatively, differential expression of genes could be under epigenetic control, such as post translational modification of histone proteins or arginine methylation  <cit> . thus, we investigated genes that were differentially expressed between rh-erp, rh-jsr and gt <dig>  regardless of snps in the coding or regulatory regions . we used expression datasets available from a previous published study  <cit> , another independent dataset with parasite gene expression levels comparing rh-erp and gt <dig>  <cit> , and our own toxoplasma arrays measuring parasite gene expression levels comparing rh-erp, rh-jsr and gt <dig> . we analyzed for transcripts that were ≥ <dig>  fold differentially expressed between rh-erp and gt <dig> across these three datasets, to identify genes that were consistently up or downregulated between rh-erp and gt <dig>  we identified  <dig> transcripts that had consistently increased and  <dig> transcripts that had consistently decreased expression in rh-erp compared to gt <dig> across all three independent datasets respectively.

from the  <dig> consistently upregulated transcripts in rh-erp compared to gt <dig> , we identified a putative ankyrin repeat containing protein . this gene was highly expressed in rh-erp in both array and rna-seq datasets, but not in gt <dig> , and had lower expression in canonical strains such as pru and veg . ankyrin repeats mediate molecular recognition via protein-protein interactions  <cit> , and proteins containing these repeats are involved in a large number of cellular functions, ranging from modulation of the nf-kb response to transcriptional regulation  <cit> . interestingly, tgank- <dig>  a parasite protein containing ankyrin repeats, is induced upon bradyzoite differentiation using rh parasites, and localizes to the parasite cytosol  <cit> . another gene that was consistently upregulated was a gra <dig> homologue, and gra <dig> co-localizes with gra <dig> and interacts with gra <dig> or gra2-associated proteins  <cit> . therefore, this gene could be associated with the increased growth rate of rh-erp compared to gt <dig> 

of the  <dig> transcripts with increased expression in gt <dig> compared to rh-erp, three encode for known rhoptry proteins, rop <dig> , rop <dig>  and rop <dig>  . rop <dig> and rop <dig> are part of a repeated gene family, and overexpression studies of rop <dig> in the rh-erp background showed that rop <dig> has major effects on host gene expression  <cit> . furthermore, as rop <dig>  rop <dig> and rop <dig> have predicted signal peptides, these rhoptry proteins might be involved in differential host modulation between rh-erp and gt <dig>  several rhoptry proteins are known to be secreted into the host cells, where they play major roles in modulation of the host cell functions  <cit> .

differentially modulated parasite pathways between type i strains
in addition, we analyzed whether the differentially expressed genes between rh-erp, rh-jsr and gt <dig> across the three independent datasets were enriched in annotated biological functions  <cit> . we focused on functional enrichment of parasite genes differentially expressed in rh-erp compared to rh-jsr and gt <dig>  using our own arrays and expression data from previous studies  <cit> . there were  <dig> gene ontology  and  <dig> interpro genesets that were significantly enriched in rh-erp compared to rh-jsr/gt <dig>  <  <dig> ). parasite genes differentially expressed in rh-erp compared to rh-jsr/gt <dig> were enriched in go processes such as transcription, translation, protein folding and iron-sulfur cluster binding . similarly, parasite genes differentially expressed in rh-erp compared to rh-jsr/gt <dig> were enriched in interpro domains such as peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases, cyclophilin-like and dna-dependent rna polymerases . this is in accord with observations that rh-erp has a higher growth rate, likely requiring increased transcription and translation, and increased extracellular viability  <cit> , likely requiring expression of stress proteins to survive extracellular stress.

differential modulation of host pathways between type i strains
because some of the differentially expressed or polymorphic toxoplasma genes, such as rop <dig>  might be involved in the modulation of host cell signaling pathways  <cit> , we determined whether different type i strains differ in their ability to modulate the host cell response. to do this, we infected hffs with rh-erp, rh-jsr and gt <dig> for  <dig> hours and determined host gene expression profiles using microarrays. we identified  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> host transcripts that were consistently up/downregulated ≥ <dig>  fold in every experiment comparing rh-erp against gt <dig>  rh-erp against rh-jsr and rh-jsr against gt <dig> respectively . as rop <dig> was differentially expressed between rh-erp and gt <dig>  and has major effects on host gene expression, we wanted to determine the effects of rop <dig> in differentially expressed host transcripts between rh-erp and gt <dig>  to do this, we used expression datasets available from a previous study that compared host gene expression after infection with rh-erp or rh-erp overexpressing rop <dig>  <cit> . from the  <dig> host transcripts that were consistently differentially expressed between rh-erp and gt <dig>   <dig> were also ≥ <dig>  fold differentially expressed between rh and rh overexpressing rop <dig> . thus, these  <dig> genes which are differentially expressed between rh-erp and gt <dig> could be due to rop <dig> expression differences.

we subsequently determined if the promoters of the consistently differentially regulated host genes were enriched for specific transcription factor binding sites   <cit> . we noted an nf-κb signature in the promoter of host genes that were upregulated ≥ <dig>  fold in gt <dig> compared to rh-erp , and also noted that type i interferon and stat <dig> signatures were present in host genes upregulated in hffs infected with gt <dig> compared to rh-erp. in addition, we observed stat <dig> enrichment in the promoter of host genes that were consistently upregulated in rh-jsr compared to rh-erp .

nf-κb activation and induction of il-12p <dig> secretion upon infection are differentially modulated by type i strains and are dependent on gra15
previous studies have shown that type ii strains activate nf-κb to a much higher level compared to types i and iii, and this difference is due to polymorphisms in the dense granule protein, gra <dig>  <cit> . it was noted that high levels of nuclear translocation of the p <dig> subunit of nf-κb were present in host cells infected with several type ii strains , while host cells infected with rh-erp and gt <dig> had much lower levels of p <dig> translocation  <cit> . our host transcriptional profile analysis across the type i strains indicated that there is an enrichment in nf-κb binding sites in the promoters of host genes that are more highly induced by gt <dig> infection compared to rh-erp . to validate this analysis, hek293t nf-κb reporter cells with nf-κb binding sites driving the expression of gfp and luciferase were infected with rh-erp, rh-jsr and gt <dig> for  <dig> hours and assayed for nf-κb dependent luciferase activity . in accord with the transcriptional profiling analysis, gt <dig> infection induced much higher nf-κb mediated luciferase activity compared to rh-erp , although this induction was still 2– <dig> fold lower compared to cells infected with pru, a type ii strain .

we then investigated whether gra <dig> could explain the differences in nf-κb activation between the type i strains, since our snp analysis indicated an indel in gra <dig> when comparing rh-erp and gt <dig> . moreover, rh-erp was shown to contain a frameshift deletion compared to gt <dig>  leading to a nonfunctional gra <dig> in rh-erp  <cit> . because rh-jsr also does not induce nf-κb activation, we sequenced gra <dig> from rh-jsr and, surprisingly, we found that rh-jsr contains a frameshift insertion at base  <dig>  this mutation is independent from the rh-erp frameshift deletion at base  <dig>  the rh-jsr insertion causes a mutation of a stretch of  <dig> amino acids followed by a premature stop codon . thus, both rh-erp and rh-jsr contain truncated gra <dig> proteins of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids respectively, while gt <dig> has the full length protein of  <dig> amino acids. gra <dig> was observed to affect parasite growth both in vitro and in vivo, as rh-erp expressing gra15ii has reduced plaque size in hffs and reduced parasite burden in mice  <cit> . thus, there could have been a selective pressure for a nonfunctional gra <dig> in rh-erp and rh-jsr, allowing for increased parasite burden in the host or faster replication in vitro.

since rh-erp provides a null genetic background with respect to gra <dig>  we generated transgenic rh-erp parasites overexpressing gra <dig> from gt <dig> and assayed for nf-κb mediated luciferase activity using the same nf-κb reporter cell line described above . the nf-κb reporter luciferase activity after infection with rh-erp+gra15gt <dig> was significantly higher than the activity after infection with rh-erp . this data supports the hypothesis that differences in nf-κb activation among type i strains are due to gra <dig>  in addition, the nf-κb family of transcription factors consist of five members, p <dig>  c-rel, rel-b, p <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> , and the nf-κb reporter contains four repeated, canonical nf-κb binding sites which can be bound by the different nf-κb subunits. previous studies showed p <dig> nuclear localization in host cells infected with type ii strains  <cit>  and we wanted to determine whether p <dig> nuclear translocation could be responsible for differential nf-κb activation observed in host cells infected by gt <dig> compared to rh-erp. hffs were infected with rh-erp, rh-jsr, gt <dig> or transgenic rh-erp+gra15gt <dig>  and nuclear localization of p <dig> was examined by immunofluorescence . there was significant nuclear translocation of p <dig> in cells infected with transgenic rh-erp+gra15gt <dig> parasites compared to uninfected cells , but no significant p <dig> nuclear translocation was observed in cells infected with rh-erp and gt <dig> . it is possible that the gra <dig> in gt <dig> activates a different nf-κb subunit from p <dig>  such as c-rel or p <dig>  but transgenic high overexpression of gra15gt <dig> in rh-erp activates p <dig> in addition to other subunits. it is also possible that there are other gt <dig> genes that could have an inhibitory effect on p <dig> translocation.

gra <dig> from type ii strains  was also shown to affect levels of il-12p <dig>  a nf-κb dependent cytokine, by infected macrophages in vitro <cit> , and regulation of il12-p <dig> production has been linked to nf-κb activation  <cit> . thus, we investigated whether type i strains differ in their ability to induce secretion of il-12p <dig> and ccl <dig>  another nf-κb dependent cytokine, and examined whether gra <dig> from gt <dig> played a role in these differences. gt <dig> infection of c57bl/ <dig> bone marrow derived macrophages resulted in secretion of higher levels of both il-12p <dig> and ccl <dig> in culture supernatants compared to rh-erp infection  and p-value =  <dig>  , student’s t test). this phenotype can be partially attributed to gra <dig>  as macrophages infected with rh-erp+gra15gt <dig> induced higher levels of il-12p <dig> and ccl <dig> compared to rh-erp  and p-value =  <dig>  , student’s t-test). however, gra15gt <dig> in the rh+gra15gt <dig> background was not sufficient to increase secretion of il12-p <dig> by infected macrophages to levels comparable to those observed in macrophages infected with gt <dig>  moreover, infection with rh-jsr, which has a nonfunctional gra <dig>  induced il12-p <dig> to levels higher than infection with rh-erp+gra15gt <dig>  and p-value =  <dig> x10- <dig> , student’s t-test). therefore, it is likely that other toxoplasma genes contribute to induction of il-12p <dig> and ccl <dig> production by infected macrophages, especially given that the regulation of il12-p <dig> is more complex than sole control by nf-κb  <cit> .

localization of p-iκbα at the pvm is strain specific, independent of nf-kb activation and partially dependent on gra2
in the canonical nf-κb activation pathway, iκbα normally inhibits nf-κb translocation and sequesters nf-κb in the cytoplasm. however, upon stimulation, iκbα is phosphorylated and subsequently targeted for proteasomal degradation via ubiquitination, exposing the nuclear localization signal in nf-κb and allowing nuclear localization to occur  <cit> . it has been previously reported that phospho-iκbα  is localized to the pvm in rh-erp infected mouse embryonic fibroblasts , and this has been linked to nf-κb activation  <cit> . however, there was little or no p-iκbα localization at the pvm in cells infected with type ii and type iii strains  <cit> . moreover, localization of p-iκbα was observed using rh-erp, and it is currently unknown whether the same phenomenon holds true for other type i strains.

thus, to determine whether p-iκbα is also redirected to the pvm in cells infected with other type i strains, immunofluorescence  with antibodies against p-iκbα was performed in hffs infected with rh-erp, rh-jsr and gt <dig>  in agreement with previous studies, p-iκbα localized to the pvm of rh-erp, but there was much less accumulation of p-iκbα at the pvm in hffs infected with other type i strains . quantification of the intensity of p-iκbα around the pvm confirmed that vacuoles containing rh-erp recruited significantly more p-iκbα than vacuoles with rh-jsr or gt <dig>  and  <dig>  , student’s t-test). it is unlikely that nf-κb activation levels are correlated with the level of p-iκbα recruitment around the pvm, given previous data that type ii strains activate nf-κb in infected host cells but do not induce accumulation of p-iκbα to the pvm  <cit> . this is further supported by the observed differences in type i strains, since neither rh-erp nor rh-jsr activate nf-κb  but rh-erp induces strong accumulation of p-iκbα at the pvm. in addition, localization of p-iκbα was similar in hffs infected with rh-erp+gra15gt <dig> compared to rh-erp infected hffs , even though rh-erp+gra15gt <dig> activates nf-κb, which further supports that nf-κb activation is unrelated to accumulation of p-iκbα on the pvm.

to determine whether accumulation of p-iκbα at the pvm could be due to a soluble factor secreted by rh-erp, immunofluorescence was performed in cells co-infected with both rh-erp and gt <dig>  recruitment of p-iκbα to the pvm was observed only in vacuoles containing rh-erp , whereas little or no p-iκbα was recruited to the gt <dig> pvm , implying that p-iκbα translocation is not induced by soluble secreted parasite factors. we also tested the effect of rop <dig>  a known secreted rhoptry kinase, on p-iκbα recruitment, and saw no observable differences between rh-erp and rhΔrop <dig> . we also observed that p-iκbα colocalized with gra <dig> at pvm extensions  where another dense granule protein, gra <dig>  has been described to be trafficked to  <cit> . furthermore, as mentioned before, gra <dig> is known to affect the vesicular network in the pv and pvm  <cit>  and we identified that rh-erp gra <dig> differs in one amino acid from rh-jsr/gt <dig> gra <dig> .

thus, we examined whether dense granule proteins had an effect on p-iκbα recruitment. even though there were no observable differences in pvm localization of p-iκbα between rh-erp and rhΔgra <dig> , there was observed reduction of p-iκbα accumulation at the pvm in cells infected with rhΔgra <dig> . since the vacuoles formed by the rhΔgra <dig> exhibit disruptions in the intravacuolar network  <cit> , lack of p-iκbα recruitment to the pvm could be due to disruption of parasitophorous vacuole biogenesis. alternatively, as gra <dig> has been found in complexes with other dense granule proteins  <cit> , these gra proteins could be directly interacting with host iκbα.

in addition, complementation of rhΔgra <dig> with either rh-erp gra <dig> or gt <dig> gra <dig> partially restored the p-iκbα localization phenotype, with increased pvm recruitment of p-iκbα present in both complemented strains compared to rhΔgra <dig> . quantification of the intensity of p-iκbα around the pvm confirmed that both complemented strains did not have significantly different pvm recruitment of p-iκbα compared to rh-erp  and p-value =  <dig>  , student’s t-test). this suggests that although gra <dig> expression is necessary for full accumulation of p-iκbα to the pvm, it is likely due to proper parasitophorous vacuole biogenesis rather than the specific polymorphism present in gra <dig> between rh-erp and gt <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, through comparative genome and gene expression analysis, we identified a list of candidate genes that could be responsible for the phenotypic differences between different type i strains. we show that polymorphisms in gra <dig> and gra <dig> determine type i strain differences in survival in ifn-γ stimulated cells and activation of nf-κb, respectively. future experiments will focus on the contribution of the individual genes to the increased growth rate, higher extracellular viability and loss of orally infectious cyst formation ability in rh-erp. thus, these identified parasite genes and differentially modulated host pathways could lead to design of new parasite targets relevant to toxoplasma pathogenesis and chronic infection. however, it is likely that many of these phenotypes are affected by a combination of snps/indels and/or expression differences across multiple parasite genes, rather than being controlled by individual or a few genes.
