BACKGROUND
plants are challenged by fluctuations in environmental factors specially temperature on almost daily basis. high temperature  exerts negative effect on growth and yield of plants  <cit> . heat shock response , defined as sum total of cellular high temperature-related defense activities, is induced upon exposure to ht. induction of an array of ubiquitous and evolutionary-conserved proteins known as heat shock proteins  is one of the main constituents of the hsr  <cit> . hsps are divided into high molecular mass proteins comprising of hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp70/dnak, hsp60/groe and small molecular mass proteins consisting of hsp <dig> or small heat shock proteins  of 16– <dig> kda. shsps form large oligomeric complexes, ranging in size from 200– <dig> kda both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. the characteristic feature of the shsps is the presence of an evolutionarily-conserved sequence of 80– <dig> long amino acids called α-crystallin domain , located in the c-terminal region. the n-terminal region preceding the acd is variable in length and amino acid sequence and contributes to a large extent towards the structural diversity amongst different shsps. hsps generally function as molecular chaperones that facilitate the native folding of proteins in unstressed and stressed conditions and play an important role during stress by preventing irreversible aggregation of denatured proteins. shsps are shown to be atp-independent molecular chaperones. experiments have shown that shsps form complexes with denatured proteins and prevent their aggregation. from these complexes, the target proteins are subsequently refolded by hsp100/hsp <dig> and co-chaperones in atp-dependent manner during the recovery phase  <cit> . expression of hsps is controlled by heat shock transcription factors  that bind to cis-acting regulatory elements called heat shock element  in the promoter region of the hsp genes.

in plants, shsps are encoded by nuclear multigene families and localized in different cellular compartments. extensive analysis of arabidopsis shsp gene family revealed that there are  <dig> genes coding for shsps and  <dig> genes encoding for acd proteins  <cit> . in arabidopsis,  <dig> shsp genes were categorized into ci, cii and ciii present in cytosol/nucleus, while one each present in chloroplast, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrion and peroxisome and  <dig> shsp genes were categorized as cytoplasm- related or plastid- related  <cit> . recently, two groups placed these  <dig> shsps into new nucleocytoplasmic and mitochondrial subfamilies that has led to the expansion of nucleocytoplasmic subfamily to  <dig> subfamilies  and mitochondrial subfamily to two subfamilies mi and mii  <cit> . the shsps gene family is not very complex in bacteria and lower eukaryotes. e. coli and s. cerevisiae have  <dig> shsp each. in human,  <dig> shsps have been reported while zebra-fish has  <dig> shsps  <cit> . the possible genes in shsp family in sugarcane are estimated to be  <dig>  <cit> . higher diversification of plant shsps may reflect an adaptation to stress conditions that is unique to plants; necessitated because plants being sessile can not escape stress environment and hence may have evolved extended mechanisms to overcome stress. detailed studies have established that plant shsps are produced in response to a wide array of environmental insults e.g. heat, cold, drought, high light, uv, osmotic stress, oxidative stress and plant- pathogen interaction  <cit>  and their concentration can go up to 1% of the total proteins under heat stress  <cit> . some shsps are highly-expressed in embryogenic tissues and growing fruits  <cit> . chloroplastic and mitochondrial shsps are considered to play an important role in heat tolerance  <cit> .

rice is considered a model plant species of the group monocots for its small genome size and availability of large collection of full-length cdnas  and for the fact that its whole genome is completely sequenced  <cit> . it is the major food crop being the staple food of about half of the world's population. spikelet fertility, grain quality and yield processes in rice are challenged by ht  <cit> . it is anticipated that rise in climate temperature due to global warming would lead to decrease in rice yield even in temperate regions  <cit> . the grain yield of rice is reported to drop by 10% for every 1°c increase in growing period minimum temperature in the dry season  <cit> . this indicates that decreased rice yields are associated with increased night time temperature which probably is a result of global warming  <cit> . to overcome the ht-induced reduction in crop yield, breeding for ht-tolerant crops is crucial  <cit> . while attempts have been made to understand structural and functional aspects of rice hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> families  <cit> , no major study has been undertaken to delineate the composition and expression analysis of rice shsp gene family. in rice, ci subfamily, hsp <dig>  of cii subfamily and hsp <dig> -p have been somewhat characterized previously  <cit> . over-expression of rice hsp <dig> -ci was shown to provide thermo-tolerance to e. coli cells  <cit> . by transgenic approach it was shown that homologous expression of hsp <dig> -ci provided heat tolerance, drought tolerance and uv-b resistance  <cit> . to better understand the potential functional relevance of the shsps in rice, it is important to understand their genomic complexity, expression profiling and tissue distribution.

in this study, genome-wide analysis of rice α-crystallin domain containing genes and their comprehensive expression analysis was performed. to study the expression, analysis of est database, fl-cdna and publicly-available microarray data sets for vegetative stages, development and stress treatments was performed. for examining ht stress response of these genes, microarray of rice leaf tissues was carried out. the microarray based expression was supported by rt-pcr analysis of  <dig> genes. our results show the complexity and diversity of shsp gene family of rice at structural and expression level. this is the first report focusing on the comprehensive expression profiles of the acd containing genes in rice.

RESULTS
complexity and organellar localization of rice shsp gene family
survey of rice genome at tigr by keywords alpha crystallin protein, small heat shock protein and heat shock protein was performed to predict genes containing conserved acd region. sequences obtained by keyword search were used as query for blast in ncbi database and the output sequences were screened for the presence of acd in prosite. after removing overlapping sequences,  <dig> sequences containing acd in rice genome were retrieved. details of all the genes encoded by these sequences are presented in table  <dig>  phylogenetic tree constructed using these  <dig> sequences and various shsps and acd proteins of arabidopsis revealed that  <dig> rice genes grouped with shsps and  <dig> genes with regions sharing homology to acd, diverged from shsps and grouped with acd proteins from arabidopsis . we however, noticed two exceptions in this clustering pattern:  hsp <dig> -cvi along with recently categorized athsp <dig> -cvi  <cit>  was present on the clade with acd genes and  acd <dig>  of rice was clustered with shsps, showing their proximity to respective genes. furthermore,  <dig> shsp genes of rice  were not clustered with any of the shsp genes of arabidopsis. a search in the est database of other plant species was further performed to check for homologs of these genes. subsequently, phylogenetic tree generated by alignment of amino acid sequence of rice shsps and ests  showed that these  <dig> shsp genes grouped into distinct clusters on separate clades with shsps from other plant species, reflecting that homologs of above mentioned genes were indeed present in other plants . based on the phylogenetic tree and in silico localization analysis , we identified rice shsp members relating to previously defined subfamilies ci, cii, ciii, m, p, er and px as well as recently identified subfamilies cv, cvi and mii  <cit> . in addition, we identified four additional nucleocytoplasmic subfamilies in rice each represented by one shsp gene. these new subfamilies are cviii , cix , cx  and cxi  . considering that there are  <dig> nucleocytoplasmic subfamilies in arabidopsis we have numbered the newly identified subfamilies from viii onwards. homologous genes for hsp <dig> -cviii, hsp <dig> b-cix and hsp <dig> -cx were found only in monocots and hsp <dig> -cxi subfamily was found to have homologous genes in dicots. thus, the  <dig> shsps of rice consist of  <dig> subfamilies distributed to various cellular organelles in the following manner:  <dig> nucleo-cytoplasmic  shsps ,  <dig> mitochondrial  shsps ,  <dig> endoplasmic reticulum -localized shsps,  <dig> plastidial  shsp and  <dig> peroxisomal  shsp having  <dig> subfamily each. as against our analysis,  <dig> genes are annotated as shsps and  <dig> genes as shsp-like or acd proteins in tigr rice genome annotation database.  <dig> shsps genes in tigr are further annotated as  <dig> ci shsps,  <dig> cii shsps,  <dig> chloroplastic shsps and  <dig> each as er and mitochondrial.

among the  <dig> acd genes in rice we identified one fl-cdna in kome database , whose conceptual translation displayed that it has  <dig> acds arranged in tandem. position of this full length clone in the genome could not be mapped on chromosome. two genes, acd <dig>  and acd <dig>  were found to have arid or bright domain in addition to the acd. the arid containing proteins from rice as well as arabidopsis were found to be chromatin-associated proteins  and are suggested to be involved in chromatin remodeling. several acd proteins were found to have predicted transmembrane domain. intracellular localization of acd <dig>   is predicted to be er in predotar and acd <dig>  , acd <dig>  and acd <dig>   show plastid localization. nonetheless, these protein sequences do not show any consensus sequences which is present in er localized proteins or chloroplastic shsps.

sequence alignment of amino acids of shsps showed that members of different subfamilies do not share high sequence similarity, yet the secondary structure is conserved across subfamilies. the 'gvl' residues which are highly conserved in the consensus region i are variable in hsp <dig> b-cix and in hsp <dig> -cvi subfamily . the β <dig> strand was noted to be absent in cv shsps of dicots. the β <dig> strand which has conserved sequence motif, basic-x-i/v-x-i/v, was absent in hsp <dig> -cvi subfamily. it is proposed that the amino acids from β <dig> strand facilitate inter-subunit linkage for oligomerization of shsps  <cit> .

twenty three shsps and  <dig> acd mapped genes  are distributed over all chromosomes, except on chromosome  <dig>  interestingly, closely related sequences of ci subfamily that clustered together in the phylogenetic tree are present on chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig> suggesting that expansion of this gene family may have occurred due to localized or intra-chromosomal duplication. in addition, one shsp and two acd genes showed segmental duplication: these include genes present on duplicated chromosomal segments between chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> , chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  and chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> . alignment of available fl-cdna and ests sequences with respective genomic dna revealed that  <dig> shsp genes are interrupted by one intron each and  <dig> shsp genes have no intron. on the contrary, the acd genes were interrupted by either single or multiple introns . the diagrammatic representation of shsp subfamilies showing acd, intron position and transit peptide is illustrated in figure  <dig> 

expression analysis of rice shsp and acd genes
the levels of expression of shsp and acd genes of rice were investigated by two approaches. the first approach was based on scrutiny of digital expression profile of ests , fl-cdna  and microarray data available at genevestigator  <cit> . the latter source facilitated the analysis of the whole genome microarray based expression data for vegetative stage, developmental stages as well as various environmental stresses excluding heat stress. in the second approach, heat stress induced expression analysis of shsps and acds genes was performed by analyzing whole genome microarray data of leaf tissues of rice . expression of shsps was further analyzed by rt-pcr analysis.

the digital expression profiles derived from the abundance of ests in diverse libraries  for shsps and acds showed that all shsp genes except hsp <dig> -mii were expressed in various libraries . highest level of ests were observed in uv-c stress library for ci shsps and a distinct induction in the ests was noticed for cii, ciii, mi, p and px shsps . ests for newly identified subfamilies hsp <dig> b-cix, hsp <dig> -cx, hsp <dig> -cxi, hsp <dig> -cv and hsp <dig> -cvi were absent in uv-c stress library. expression of most of the shsp genes  was found in mixed-library though the est abundance was much lower as compared to that in stress library. expression of hsp <dig> -cv was noted in flower and panicle while hsp <dig> -cii was restricted to the embryo and pistil libraries suggesting that the expression of these shsps may be regulated in specific tissues or at developmental stages. expression of alternative splice variants of six shsp genes was observed in est analysis . however, we noted fl-cdna and est support for alternative spliced variant of hsp <dig> -cv and hsp <dig> -cxi. . no expression evidence was found for one shsp gene and  <dig> acd genes in est analysis. expression of four shsps and seven acd genes was not supported by fl-cdnas .

developmental stage specific expression of shsps
microarray based expression analysis of developmental stages of rice plant showed that transcripts of most of the shsp genes were widely expressed although their expression levels varied at different developmental stages . hsp <dig> b-cix, hsp <dig> -cx, hsp <dig> -mii, hsp <dig> -cv and hsp <dig> -cvi were expressed constitutively in both root and shoot. the latter two genes were expressed in shoot, leaf and culm in moderately high levels. in stigma and ovary, transcripts of seven shsp genes  were present in moderate level. in various parts of panicle, eight shsp genes  displayed varied expression. we further noted that transcripts of ci shsp genes located on chromosome  <dig> , hsp <dig> -mi and hsp <dig> -cii were present in high abundance during early stages of development of pollen and tapetum as shown by laser micro dissection microarray data analysis of anther development  <cit>  . in contrast, during late stages of anther development  significant expression of hsp <dig> a and hsp <dig> -cii was observed. during various stages of seed development, shsp genes from most of the subfamilies exhibited differential expression.

stress induced expression of shsps
microarray based analysis of  <dig> d old seedlings of rice under lt stress  revealed that except for hsp <dig> c-ci, hsp <dig> -ci and hsp <dig> -mii which are upregulated, expression of most of the shsp genes is unaltered . salt stress  caused upregulation of ten genes and down regulation of three genes. under dehydration stress enhanced transcript level of eight shsp genes and reduced transcript of six genes was observed. five genes  showing upregulation were common in salt and drought stress. transcript level of most of the shsp genes was responsive to anoxia stress. anoxia stress caused drastic enhancement of the transcript level  of hsp <dig> a-ci, hsp <dig> -ci and hsp <dig> -mi whereas transcript of hsp <dig> -cl, hsp <dig> -cii, hsp <dig> -cii, hsp <dig> -ciii, chloroplast and er shsps were moderately up-regulated  <cit> . however, six genes  were down-regulated in anoxia . in response to sodium arsenate stress in roots of rice, nine genes  were shown to be up-regulated  <cit> . in response to biotic stress , hsp <dig> -ci, hsp <dig> -ci, hsp <dig> a-ci, hsp <dig> -cii and both mi genes were upregulated and  <dig> genes  were down regulated.

to get insight into the expression profiling of the shsp gene family under heat stress, microarray data of rice leaf tissues was analyzed. the probes for hsp <dig> -er and hsp <dig> -mii were absent on the 60k chip used for expression analysis. in addition, there are two probes  on the chip showing cross-reactivity with seven ci shsps . hence, there were no specific probes for hsp <dig> a-ci, hsp <dig> -ci, hsp <dig> a-ci and hsp <dig> b-ci. the expression of shsp genes belonging to various subfamilies was highly up-regulated under ht . transcript level of  <dig> shsp genes showed up-regulation by more than  <dig> fold within  <dig> min at 42°c. overall, expression of shsps under ht followed  <dig> types of kinetics: type i where expression was initially enhanced after  <dig> min at 42°c, on further exposure for  <dig> h decrease in the transcript level was registered ; type ii where up-regulation within  <dig> min at 42°c was further enhanced upon increasing the stress duration to  <dig> h ; type iii where there was no significant change in the expression of shsp genes till  <dig> min at 42°c but the transcript level was upregulated drastically  after  <dig> h at 42°c . no change in the transcript level of hsp <dig> -px, hsp <dig> -cvi, hsp <dig> -cv, hsp <dig> -cxi and hsp <dig> -cx was observed. transcripts of all the upregulated shsp genes were retained after  <dig> min of recovery, albeit a marginal decline in the level was observed.

subsequent expression analysis of shsp genes by semi-quantitative rt-pcr using rna from root and shoot validated that transcript of most of the shsp genes were upregulated in both the tissues under ht. the transcripts of hsp <dig> -cv and hsp <dig> -cvi were constitutively present and their level was unaltered under heat, cold, dehydration and salt stress . constitutive expression of hsp <dig> -cv and hsp <dig> -cvi and low transcript abundance of hsp <dig> -cvi in comparison to hsp <dig> -cv is commensurate with the expression data from published microarrays . at 37°c for  <dig> min, significant levels of transcript were noted for eight genes  whereas marginal increase in the transcript level of  <dig> genes  was observed. at temperatures higher than 37°c, further increase in the transcript level of shsps was observed. we noted that the expression behavior of two shsp genes in semi-quantitative rt-pcr is not in agreement with the results of microarray. hsp <dig> -px and hsp <dig> -cxi did not show ht inducibility in microarray; however, transcript level of these two genes was upregulated under heat stress conditions in rt-pcr. it was further noted that expression of hsp <dig> -mi and hsp <dig> -ciii was in cold and dehydration stress . in panicle, feeble signal for expression of hsp <dig> a-ci, hsp <dig> -ciii, hsp <dig> -cv and hsp <dig> -cvi was noticed. in mature seed, expression pattern of shsp genes was concurrent with the microarray based expression. no expression was seen for hsp <dig> -cx, hsp <dig> -cii and acd <dig>  under the stress condition used for rt-pcr, though the expression of latter two genes is supported by fl-cdna clones .

expression analysis of acd genes
acd genes were also widely expressed in various developmental stages. unlike shsp genes, most of the acd genes were found to be constitutively expressed in root and shoot. acd <dig> , acd <dig> , acd <dig> , acd <dig>  and acd <dig>  were expressed during developmental stages of rice plant . in general, expression of acd genes was not affected significantly by cold, salt, dehydration and anoxia stress except acd <dig>  which showed upregulation under anoxia stress . expression of acd genes was either unaffected or downregulated under heat stress . however, two acd genes, acd <dig>  and acd <dig>  showed upregulation under ht. rt-pcr analysis showed that transcripts of acd <dig> , acd <dig>  and acd <dig>  genes displayed constitutive expression and remained unaffected under stress conditions.

in silico analysis of promoter regions of shsp genes
expression of hsp genes is regulated at transcriptional level by binding of hsfs to hses. the analysis of promoter region of shsp genes , using place database showed that hses were present only in the promoters of hsp <dig> -ci and hsp <dig> -ci genes. further investigation showed that this database recognizes 5'-ctngaannttcnag-3' as hse module. as varied combinations of palindromic repeats of ngaan are considered functional hses  <cit> , we subsequently followed manual inspection and motif-based sequence analysis tool meme  for motif search. for the latter approach we opted to select  <dig> motifs . out of these  <dig> different motifs ,  <dig> relevant motifs  showed consensus sequences similar to known palindromic ngaan  and its variants  in many shsp genes. from these analyses, it emerged that promoters of seven shsp genes  contained a perfect hse module . promoter regions of other shsps showed imperfect hse module . majority of the hses were located proximal to the atg. distal hses were noticed in the promoters of hsp <dig> -px, hsp <dig> -ci and hsp <dig> -mii. none of the promoters of acd genes were found to have perfect hses. however, nngaannttc or nnttcnngaann was present in acd <dig> , acd <dig>  and acd <dig>  promoters .

discussion
based on genome-wide analysis of acd containing gene family, this study shows that rice has  <dig> shsp and  <dig> acd genes. in contrast, arabidopsis has  <dig> shsps and  <dig> acd proteins  <cit> . in earlier attempts on categorization of arabidopsis shsps, it was proposed that while  <dig> genes do not fall in distinct subfamilies, rest of the shsps can be placed into  <dig> subfamilies   <cit> . in a more recent attempt, arabidopsis shsp gene family has been extended to  <dig> subfamilies by placing the  <dig> uncategorized shsp genes into  <dig> new nucleocytoplasmic subfamilies  and by adding a new mitochondrial subfamily mii   <cit> . the latter study further showed that homologous genes of arabidopsis civ and cvii subfamily are not present in rice  <cit> . waters et al  <cit>  performed comparative analysis of shsp gene family of arabidopsis, populus and rice and suggested that the plant shsp gene family may be categorized into  <dig> subfamilies. this group indicated that  <dig> shsp genes of rice namely os <dig> c , os <dig> a , os <dig> , os <dig>   and os <dig>   are so-called orphan genes because their homologs are not found in populus and arabidopsis. our analysis shows that gene entry corresponding to os02g <dig>  has a definite homolog in arabidopsis . we further find that hsp <dig> b-cix  gene also does not have homologous counterpart in arabidopsis. we show that homologs of rice entries corresponding to os01g <dig> , os01g <dig>  and os02g <dig>  are actually present in monocots, homologs of os02g <dig>  are present in dicots and homologs of os11g <dig>  are present in both monocots and dicots. these genes in bootstrap nj tree analysis segregated into separate clades which are supported by significant bootstrap score of 70% and above. based on comprehensive analysis done in this work, we propose that shsp gene family of rice is constituted of  <dig> subfamilies. we show that there are nine nucleocytoplasmic subfamilies in rice and ci subfamily is the largest with seven members.

this study highlights that 74% of rice shsp genes are intronless based on genomic organization data. in rice, overall ~20% of the genes are intronless  <cit> . importantly, the length of the introns in intron harboring shsp genes of rice is relatively short . intron length is reported to be inversely proportional to gene expression levels in humans and worms and positively associated with expression level in plants  <cit> . there are indications that introns pose hindrance to rapid gene regulation and are selected against in those genes which require quick adjustment in transcript level to overcome the environmental challenges  <cit> . incidentally, shsp genes are one of the rapidly expressed genes as shsp transcripts are observed within  <dig> min of ht in most cases. the absence of introns or their presence with smaller size may thus have correlation to rapid induction needs of shsp genes. further, orthologous genes generally tend to maintain the same exon-intron structure  <cit> . we observed an interesting point regarding intron in plastidial shsp genes: the plastidial shsp gene of arabidopsis has one intron while the intron is absent in plastidial shsp gene of rice. on further examination, we note that plastidial shsp genes in dicots like populus, vitis and g. arboreum also contain one intron. intron was noted to be present in chloroplast shsp gene of monocots like maize and bentgrass  but absent in rice. wild rice o. minuta also has intronless chloroplastic shsp gene. this may thus suggest that intronloss feature in chloroplastic shsp gene of rice may have appeared after their divergence from common ancestor into subfamily erhartoideae  and panicoideae .

from the expression analysis, it is evident that there is spatio-temporal regulation of rice shsp genes under stress and developmental stages. an overview of shsp expression under stress and development is presented in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig>  it is evident from this presentation that the expression of shsp genes is mainly associated with heat stress  as well as under unstressed conditions in vegetative tissues, pollens and seeds. various nucleocytoplasmic shsps  followed this typical expression pattern under ht and seed development. in an earlier study, shsps of ci were shown to be present in dry seeds of rice  <cit> . in pollens, all ci shsps were not expressed. this observation is in agreement with the ci shsp expression in arabidopsis. hsp <dig> -cii gene was not induced by ht and its transcript was barely detectable in seed. in arabidopsis, both the cii members were shown to be induced by ht. expression profile of cv and cvi shsps differed from ci, cii and ciii shsps. these genes were expressed constitutively in root, shoot and leaf. moreover, expression of genes from both cv and cvi subfamilies was not altered by ht. the homologous genes of rice hsp <dig> -cv and hsp <dig> -cvi in arabidopsis  also are expressed constitutively in vegetative tissues  <cit> . while expression of athsp <dig> -cvi was unaffected by ht, expression of athsp <dig> -cv was rather downregulated. expression behavior of cv and cvi shsp genes differed during developmental stages as well. hsp <dig> -cv was expressed in all parts of panicle and showed feeble expression in seed, and hsp <dig> -cvi was moderately expressed in seed only. in comparison, the homologous genes of arabidopsis were not expressed in seed. amongst the monocot specific shsps, two genes  were constitutively expressed in root, shoot and leaf. the constitutive expression of shsps in vegetative organs implies that these proteins may be involved in house keeping activity of the cells. overall, there is a considerable variation in the expression of shsp genes under ht and development. though hsp <dig> b-cix and hsp <dig> -cviii were induced by ht, the extent of induction was not as high as noted for ci shsps. expression of hsp <dig> -cx was not responsive to ht. in seed, moderate to negligible expression levels of hsp <dig> b-cix, hsp <dig> -cviii and hsp <dig> -cx were observed. the transcript of hsp <dig> -cxi was induced to a mild extent under ht. the expression of this gene was not noticed in any other developmental stage except in seed . multiplicity of these genes in cytoplasm may suggest functional redundancy of cytoplasmic shsps. however, the expression profile results may also be considered as a support to hypothesize that these proteins perform diverse functions under stress and development.

all the organellar shsps were induced by ht. hsp <dig> -mii showed constitutive expression in root, shoot and leaf. differential expression of organellar shsps was evident during various stages of anther development  and seed. in arabidopsis, peroxisomal and mitochondrial hsp <dig> -mii was expressed in seeds and none of the organellar shsps were reported in any other development stage. under stress conditions, shsps reportedly function as chaperones protecting cellular proteins from denaturation and maintaining the protein homeostasis of the cells. functional roles of shsps under unstressed conditions have not been extensively worked out. recently, it is proposed that these proteins may perform non-chaperone functions under constitutive conditions  <cit> .

acd proteins which seem to have diverged from shsps during the course of evolution  showed expression patterns resembling cv and cvi shsps. most of the acd genes were constitutively expressed in vegetative organs . these genes were rather downregulated under ht. in this respect, acd genes are similar in expression to cv shsps of arabidopsis. cellular roles of acd proteins are not very well established. osacd <dig>  and its homologs in tobacco and arabidopsis are shown to be constitutively expressed  <cit> . the c-terminal-truncated osslt <dig> exhibited atp-independent chaperone activity and also provides enhanced thermotolerance to recombinant e. coli  <cit> . in contrast, atslt <dig> and ntslt <dig> are implicated in na+ homeostasis  <cit> . another acd gene, atacd <dig>   shows high level of constitutive expression and possesses chaperone activity in vivo  <cit> . thus, it may appear that functionally acds have role similar to constitutive shsps or could be that these proteins are involved in specialized functions.

at the molecular level, it is proposed that the interplay of hses with corresponding trans-regulatory hsfs regulates the expression of hsp genes. it is well documented that variations in the configuration of hses have a profound role in the expression of hsp genes in stress and development  <cit> . the in silico analysis carried out in this study showed that promoters of almost all the shsp genes harbor minimum one module of putative hse. various modules of hses have been shown to be functional in the promoters of shsp genes in stress and embryogenesis  <cit> . analysis of stress inducibility of three shsp genes by promoter-gus fusion revealed that promoter of hsp <dig> a-ci with imperfect hse was induced  <dig>  times and the promoters of hsp <dig> -ci and hsp <dig> -ci, both having perfect hses were induced  <dig>  and  <dig>  times, respectively  <cit> . however, expression of hsp <dig> a-ci was noted to be higher in comparison to hsp <dig> -ci and hsp <dig> -ci under similar stress conditions  <cit> . experimental verification of shsp promoters by deletion analysis may reflect the relevance of these putative hses in stress and development.

CONCLUSIONS
this study makes contributions towards the genomic complexity and expression diversity of the shsps gene family of rice. through global transcript profiling by microarray and rt-pcr analysis, we have shown that most of the shsps genes are highly upregulated in response to high temperature. we also noted that several shsp genes are expressed constitutively in vegetative tissues and during panicle or seed development. thus, we show that shsps may be involved in cellular functions under non-stress and stress conditions as well as during developmental processes. it remains to be appreciated how the individual members of the shsp gene family which have different pattern of expression depending on the organ, tissue and stage of development, are important in co-ordination of the overall heat shock response.
