BACKGROUND
the gram-negative bacteria legionella pneumophila is the causative pathogen of legionnaires' disease, a potentially fatal type of pneumonia affecting both immunocompromised and immunocompetent subjects. this bacterium is a facultative intracellular pathogen of amoeba in natural and man-made aquatic environments. infection of humans occurs after inhalation of contaminated water aerosol droplets. dependent on its type iv secretion system dot/icm, l. pneumophila initiates biogenesis of a specialized vacuole that it critical for legionella replication  <cit> . this legionella-containing vacuole avoids fusion with lysosomes and acquires vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . in addition, the bacterial flagellum with its major component flagellin is also considered to represent a virulence-associated factor  <cit> .

for l. pneumophila pathogenesis, important results were obtained by analyzing infection of protozoans or immune cells like macrophages  <cit> . however, recent studies have shown that l. pneumophila replicates also in human alveolar epithelial cells  <cit> . although legionella less efficiently replicates within human t cells compared with macrophages  <cit> , little is known of the consequences of t cell infection with legionella.

the objective of this study was to assess whether l. pneumophila interferes with the immune system by interacting and infecting t cells. the results demonstrated that l. pneumophila interacted with and infected t cells. to investigate l. pneumophila-t cell interactions, we examined whether l. pneumophila induces production of interleukin- <dig> , an inflammatory chemokine associated with immune-mediated pathology and involved in recruitment and activation of neutrophils and other immune cells. the results showed that l. pneumophila directly increased il- <dig> by activation of transforming growth factor β-associated kinase  <dig> , p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase , and jun n-terminal kinase , leading to activation of transcription factors, nf-κb, ap- <dig>  cyclic amp response element  binding protein , and activating transcription factor- <dig> .

RESULTS
multiplication of l. pneumophila in human t cells
to investigate the interaction of l. pneumophila with t cells, we first examined intracellular growth of l. pneumophila strain aa100jm in jurkat cells by 72-h continuous cultures. the cfu per well of aa100jm growing in jurkat cell cultures began to increase after  <dig> h and then increased time-dependently . however, the cfu of the avirulent mutant strain with a knockout in doto, encoding a protein essential for type iv secretion system, did not increase during the 72-h period . in contrast, the multiplication of flaa mutant did not change in jurkat cells compared with the wild-type corby . to characterize the multiplication of l. pneumophila in human t cells, intracellular growth in cd4+ t cells of l. pneumophila was examined. the cfu of the wild-type corby increased after infection for  <dig> h in cd4+ t cells, although it replicated less efficiently compared with the observations with jurkat cells . staining of the infected jurkat cells for l. pneumophila showed increased intracellular replication of aa100jm, corby, and flaa mutant, but not doto mutant after  <dig> h in culture . these observations suggest that l. pneumophila can replicate in human t cells and the type iv secretion system plays a role in l. pneumophila replication in human t cells.

high serum il- <dig> levels in patients with legionella pneumonia
to investigate the role of il- <dig> in the pathogenesis of legionella pneumonia, the circulating concentrations of il- <dig> were measured. serum il- <dig> levels were higher in patients with legionella pneumonia   than in normal healthy controls  , although this difference was not statistically significant . therefore, we analyzed the signaling pathways for il- <dig> activation by legionalla infection.

infection of jurkat and cd4+ t cells by l. pneumophila induces il- <dig> expression
jurkat cells were infected with wild-type l. pneumophila strains aa100jm and corby for up to  <dig> h. total cellular rna was isolated from these cells at  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h after the infection and il- <dig> gene expression was analyzed by rt-pcr. il- <dig> mrna expression increased after the infection . in another series of experiments, in which jurkat cells were infected with aa100jm and corby at different concentrations for  <dig> h , both strains induced dose-dependent expression of il- <dig> mrna. next, we examined the correlation between il- <dig> expression levels and the virulence of l. pneumophila. as shown in fig. 2a, il- <dig> mrna expression was induced after infection with the avirulent doto mutant, but became gradually weaker from  <dig> to  <dig> h. in contrast, a flaa knockout mutant, defective in flagellin production, failed to induce il- <dig> mrna after infection . to characterize the effect of l. pneumophila infection on human t cells, il- <dig> mrna expression in cd4+ t cells in response to l. pneumophila was examined by rt-pcr. after infection for  <dig> h, l. pneumophila induced il- <dig> mrna expression in cd4+ t cells, similar to the observations with jurkat cells .

to determine the correlation between il- <dig> expression level and l. pneumophila bacterial proteins, heat-killed corby was used to infect jurkat cells at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig>  at  <dig> h, il- <dig> was not expressed in jurkat cells infected with the heat-killed strain . furthermore, il- <dig> gene expression was not induced when paraformaldehyde-fixed l. pneumophila was used . however, bacteria heated at 56°c for  <dig> min induced il- <dig> expression. these results suggest that the surface proteins of bacteria but not lipopolysaccharide are required for il- <dig> induction. considered together, it seems that legionella flagellin is involved in il- <dig> expression in t cells.

flagellin is recognized by toll-like receptor  <dig>   <cit> . thus, we also examined the expression of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig> mrnas in jurkat and cd4+ t cells. all tlr mrnas examined were expressed in jurkat and cd4+ t cells . furthermore, their expression levels did not change by l. pneumophila infection in cd4+ t cells  and jurkat cells .

il- <dig> production from jurkat cells during infection with l. pneumophila
we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  to determine il- <dig> protein levels in culture supernatants of jurkat cells at  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> h after infection with either the parental strain corby or flaa mutant strain at an moi of  <dig>  il- <dig> was induced by corby in a time-dependent manner. on the other hand, the amount of il- <dig> produced by jurkat cells infected with the flaa mutant strain was significantly less than that by cells infected with the wild-type strain . corby-induced il- <dig> production by jurkat cells was moi-dependent . corby also induced a significant amount of il- <dig> from cd4+ t cells .

l. pneumophila induces il- <dig> gene transcription via a sequence spanning positions - <dig> to - <dig> of the il- <dig> gene promoter
to delineate the mechanism by which l. pneumophila induces il- <dig> gene transcription, we identified l. pneumophila-responsive promoter elements in the il- <dig> promoter. this was achieved by transfecting jurkat cells with various plasmid constructs containing the luciferase reporter gene driven by the il- <dig> promoter. twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were infected with l. pneumophila strain corby. l. pneumophila infection resulted in activation of the 5' region  <dig>  bp full-length promoter in an moi-dependent manner . these results indicate that l. pneumophila induces il- <dig> expression in jurkat cells at transcriptional level. next, we used a deletion analysis approach to identify the essential promoter element for transcriptional upregulation following a stimulus. high induction levels were observed with a reporter construct containing il- <dig> 5'-flanking sequence starting with position - <dig>  to position - <dig>  deletion of sequences upstream of position - <dig> abolished induction of il- <dig> by l. pneumophila infection . the il- <dig> gene fragment spanning positions - <dig> to - <dig> bp contains three prominent dna-protein interaction sites for the transcription factors ap- <dig>  nuclear factor il- <dig> , and nf-κb . this maps the region from - <dig> to - <dig> bp as a l. pneumophila-responsive region, which is likely to contain individual l. pneumophila-responsive regulatory elements.

to identify the cis-acting element in the - <dig> to - <dig> bp region of the il- <dig> promoter, which served as a l. pneumophila-responsive regulatory element, we prepared and tested site-directed mutant constructs . mutation in the nf-κb site  and ap- <dig> site  suppressed l. pneumophila-induced il- <dig> expression. however, mutation of the nf-il- <dig> site  had no such effect. these results indicate that activation of the il- <dig> promoter in jurkat cells in response to l. pneumophila infection requires an intact binding site for the nf-κb and ap- <dig> elements.

flagellin-dependent activation of nf-κb
because the internal mutational analysis of il- <dig> promoter indicated that l. pneumophila infection activated transcription through the nf-κb site, it was important to identify the nuclear factor that binds to this site. the nf-κb sequence derived from the il- <dig> promoter was used as a probe in electrophoretic mobility shift assay . jurkat cells were infected with corby strain at different times after challenge, and nuclear protein extracts were prepared and analyzed to determine nf-κb dna binding activity. as shown in fig. 6a, a complex was induced in these cells within  <dig> min after infection with corby and increased in a time-dependent manner. this nf-κb binding activity to il- <dig> promoter was reduced by the addition of either cold probe or a typical nf-κb sequence derived from the il- <dig> receptor  α-chain  enhancer but not by an oligonucleotide containing the ap- <dig> binding site . next, we characterized the l. pneumophila-induced complexes identified by the il- <dig> nf-κb probe. these complexes were diminished and supershifted by the addition of anti-p <dig> or anti-p <dig> antibody , suggesting that l. pneumophila-induced il- <dig> nf-κb complexes are composed of p <dig> and p <dig>  based on these results, one can conclude that l. pneumophila infection seems to induce il- <dig> gene expression at least in part through induced binding of p <dig> and p <dig> to the nf-κb site in the il- <dig> promoter region.

as described above, the flaa mutant strain failed to induce mrna expression and production of il- <dig>  next, we determined whether the flaa mutant strain induces nf-κb dna binding activity. as expected, nf-κb dna binding activity was not induced by the isogenic flaa mutant, unlike the wild-type strain corby . these results indicate that better activation of nf-κb binding by flaa-positive strain is the underlying mechanism of the observed activation of the il- <dig> promoter by this bacterial strain. considered together, these results indicate that l. pneumophila infection induces il- <dig> gene expression at least in part through the induced binding of p <dig> and p <dig> nf-κb family members to the nf-κb element of the il- <dig> promoter and that this effect is dependent on flagellin.

because nuclear translocation is a key step for transcriptional activity  <cit> , we next examined whether l. pneumophila induces the nuclear translocation of nf-κb. as shown in fig. 6c, the wild-type corby, but not the flaa mutant, induced nuclear translocation of nf-κb. nf-κb is normally present in the cytoplasm in an inactive state and is bound to members of the iκb inhibitor protein family, chiefly iκbα. in this complex, iκbα blocks the nuclear localization signal, thus preventing nuclear translocation. translocation of nf-κb into the nucleus requires disruption of the cytoplasmic nf-κb:iκbα complex  <cit> . to determine the role of iκbα phosphorylation and degradation in l. pneumophila-induced nf-κb translocation and activation, we investigated whether l. pneumophila induces phosphorylation and degradation of iκbα. the latter two processes were examined by western blot analysis using antibodies against phosphorylated and total iκbα, respectively. fig. 6d shows phosphorylation and degradation of iκbα in jurkat cells infected with the wild-type corby but not the flaa mutant for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h. the iκbα phosphorylation became evident at  <dig> h and decreased thereafter. consistent with this, corby-induced degradation of iκbα was observed at  <dig> h.

nf-κb signaling occurs either through the classical or alternative pathway  <cit> . in the classical pathway, nf-κb dimers, such as p50/p <dig>  are maintained in the cytoplasm by interaction with iκbα. whereas the classical nf-κb activation is iκb kinase β- and ikkγ-dependent and occurs through iκbα phosphorylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation, the alternative pathway depends on ikkα homodimers and nf-κb-inducing kinase  and results in regulated processing of the p <dig> precursor protein to p <dig> via phosphorylation and degradation of its iκb-terminus  <cit> . indeed, the wild-type corby but not the flaa mutant induced phosphorylation of p <dig> and upstream kinase ikkβ . next, we examined the alternative pathway, which involves the cleavage of nf-κb2/p <dig> to p <dig>  the level of p <dig> protein increased in jurkat cells infected with the wild-type corby but not the flaa mutant , indicating that flagellin activates nf-κb via the alternative pathway.

nf-κb signal is essential for induction of il- <dig> expression by l. pneumophila
to further confirm the involvement of iκbα degradation, we transfected the cells with transdominant mutant of iκbα in which two critical serine residues required for inducer-mediated phosphorylation were deleted  <cit> . as seen in fig. 6e, overexpression of mutant iκbα greatly inhibited the corby-induced il- <dig> promoter activation. this observation implicates the involvement of iκbα phosphorylation and degradation in flagellin-induced il- <dig> expression.

to address the mechanism of flagellin-mediated il- <dig> expression, we investigated the role of nik and ikk in l. pneumophila-induced il- <dig> expression. cotransfection with the dominant-negative mutant forms of nik, ikkα, ikkβ, and ikkγ inhibited l. pneumophila-induced il- <dig> expression . myd <dig> is a universal adaptor for induction of cytokines by tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig>  it is also required for activation of nf-κb by these tlrs  <cit> . likewise, overexpression of a dominant negative mutant form of myd <dig> also inhibited l. pneumophila-induced il- <dig> expression. taken together, these findings clearly demonstrate that l. pneumophila induces il- <dig> expression via activation of flagellin-dependent nf-κb signaling pathway.

because activation of the il- <dig> promoter by l. pneumophila infection required the activation of nf-κb, we blocked nf-κb activation with bay 11- <dig>  an inhibitor of iκbα phosphorylation  <cit> . bay 11- <dig> markedly inhibited l. pneumophila-induced phosphorylation and degradation of iκbα, as well as nf-κb dna binding . furthermore, bay 11- <dig> resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in l. pneumophila-induced il- <dig> mrna expression and secretion by jurkat cells .

flagellin-dependent activation of ap-1
to obtain further evidence for the ap- <dig> site on the il- <dig> promoter in response to l. pneumophila, we examined the nuclear factors that bind to this site. the ap- <dig> sequence derived from the il- <dig> promoter was used as a probe in emsa. jurkat cells were infected with the wild-type corby or the flaa mutant at different times after challenge, and nuclear protein extracts were prepared and analyzed to determine ap- <dig> dna binding activity. as shown in fig. 8a, markedly increased complexes were induced by corby compared with that induced by the isogenic flaa mutant. these results indicate that better activation of ap- <dig> binding by the flagellin-positive strain is the underlying mechanism of the observed activation of the il- <dig> promoter by l. pneumophila. this ap- <dig> binding activity to the il- <dig> promoter was reduced by the addition of either cold probe or a creb sequence but not by an nf-κb sequence derived from the il-2rα enhancer .

next, we characterized the l. pneumophila-induced complexes identified by the il- <dig> ap- <dig> probe. these complexes were diminished and supershifted by the addition of anti-c-jun, anti-jund, anti-atf <dig>  or anti-creb antibody . the addition of these four antibodies completely diminished ap- <dig> dna binding . these results suggest that flagellin-induced il- <dig> ap- <dig> complexes are composed of c-jun, jund, atf <dig>  and creb to the ap- <dig> site in the il- <dig> promoter region. next, we examined phosphorylation of these four proteins in jurkat cells infected with corby or the isogenic flaa mutant. corby but not flaa mutant enhanced phosphorylation of c-jun, jund, atf <dig>  and creb in a time-dependent manner . these transcription factors are phosphorylated by p <dig> mapk, jnk, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase   <cit> . furthermore, activated mapks phosphorylate ap- <dig>  creb, and atf complexes, which results in increased ap-1-dependent transcription. we investigated whether l. pneumophila corby activates these mapks.

the p <dig> mapk pathway mediates activation of creb and atf <dig> by flagellin
phosphorylation of p <dig> mapk by corby was determined by western blot analysis . corby, but not the flaa mutant, phosphorylated mapkapk- <dig> and msk <dig>  downstream creb/atf kinases of p <dig> mapk in jurkat cells . consistent with the role of p <dig> mapk phosphorylation in jurkat cells infected with corby in il- <dig> expression and release, sb <dig>  a p <dig> mapk inhibitor, reduced corby-induced il- <dig> expression and release by jurkat cells in a dose-dependent manner . furthermore, sb <dig> inhibited corby-induced luciferase activity of the il- <dig> promoter in a dose-dependent manner . similarly, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant form of either p38α or p38β also inhibited corby-induced luciferase activity of the il- <dig> promoter, confirming the involvement of p <dig> mapk in flagellin-induced il- <dig> expression . the finding that sb <dig> prevented corby-induced phosphorylation of creb and atf <dig>  and mapkapk- <dig> and msk <dig>  downstream targets of p <dig> mapk , suggests that mapkapk- <dig> and msk <dig> seem to mediate the flagellin-induced phosphorylation of creb and atf <dig> 

effects of jnk and erk on flagellin-induced il- <dig> expression
we also examined the effect of flagellin on activation of jnk and erk. corby, but not the flaa mutant, markedly increased the phosphorylation of jnk and mapk kinase  <dig> , upstream activator of jnk, and erk in jurkat cells . in addition, sp <dig>  an inhibitor of jnk, suppressed corby-induced il- <dig> expression and release in a dose-dependent manner . the finding that sp <dig> inhibited corby-induced phosphorylation of c-jun but not jund , suggests that jnk seems to mediate the flagellin-induced phosphorylation of c-jun.

to determine the direct role of erk phosphorylation in l. pneumophila-induced il- <dig> expression, jurkat cells were infected with corby in the absence or presence of pd <dig>  an inhibitor of mek1/ <dig>  an upstream activator of erk. rna and supernatants were collected after  <dig> and  <dig> h of infection and assayed for il- <dig> mrna expression and release, respectively. the addition of pd <dig> had no effect on l. pneumophila-induced il- <dig> mrna expression and release by jurkat cells . the activity of this inhibitor was verified by examining the phosphorylation state of erk in l. pneumophila-infected cells after selected incubation time periods with pd <dig>  whereas erk activity was reduced in jurkat cells in the presence of the inhibitor, the phosphorylation of creb, atf <dig>  c-jun, and jund was not affected .

effect of tak <dig> on flagellin-induced il- <dig> expression
tak <dig> is one of the most characterized mapk kinase kinase family members and is activated by various cellular stresses including il- <dig>  <cit> . tak <dig> functions as an upstream stimulatory molecule of the jnk, p <dig> mapk, and ikk signaling pathways. accordingly, we investigated whether tak <dig> is also involved in l. pneumophila-induced il- <dig> expression. as shown in fig. 9a, phosphorylation of tak <dig> was induced in jurkat cells infected with corby but not with flaa mutant. furthermore, a dominant negative mutant of tak <dig> inhibited l. pneumophila-induced il- <dig> activation . these data suggest that trifurcation of l. pneumophila flagellin-induced ikk-iκb, mkk4-jnk, and p <dig> mapk signaling pathways occurs at tak <dig> 

discussion
innate immunity is essential for limiting l. pneumophila infection at cellular and microbe levels. tlrs are involved in controlling l. pneumophila infection in vivo, since mice lacking tlr <dig> are more susceptible to infection, and myd88-deficient mice show defective control of l. pneumophila infection  <cit> . knowledge about host immunoreaction against l pneumophila is mainly based on studies on macrophages. while adaptive immunity has been shown to be important for host resistance to l. pneumophila  <cit> , the direct interaction of bacteria with adaptive immune cells such as t cells is not well known. in this study, we show that l. pneumophila stimulates jurkat t cells. furthermore, this stimulation of t cells is mainly provided by flagellin since the flaa mutant was deficient in stimulating t cells to produce il- <dig>  this difference was independent of bacterial replication, as the flaa mutant could replicate in jurkat t cells. although legionella less efficiently replicates within t cells, it is possible that uninfected t cells might respond to extracellular flagellin. whether or not t cells are infected with l. pneumophila in vivo, they might still conceivably be a source of il- <dig>  because extracellular flagellin could induce il- <dig> expression  <cit>  and induction of il- <dig> by l. pneumophilla did not require invasion. interestingly, tlr5-deficient mice had lower numbers of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in their broncho-alveolar lavage fluid in comparison to wild-type mice after legionella infection  <cit> .

infection with flagellin-deficient l. pneumophila has been reported to induce a robust cytokine response equivalent to infection with wild-type l. pneumophila in macrophages  <cit> . this cytokine response requires a functional l. pneumophila dot/icm type iv secretion system in macrophages and dendritic cells  <cit> , indicating that t cells are unique. although bacterial lipoprotein can also stimulate t cells  <cit> , stimulation with lipoprotein of l. pneumophila has not yet been shown for human t cells.

in this study, we demonstrated that l. pneumophila induces il- <dig> expression through flagellin and nf-κb signaling pathway modulates this induction in human t cells. using a specific pharmacological inhibitor, we showed that ikk-nf-κb pathway augmented l. pneumophila induction of il- <dig> expression. we confirmed the important role of nf-κb by showing that overexpression of dominant negative nik, ikks, and iκbα, potent inhibitors of nf-κb activation, inhibited il- <dig> promoter activation by l. pneumophila. the alternative pathway proceeds via nik-, ikkα, and protein synthesis-dependent processing of the p <dig> precursor protein to the p <dig> form and resulted in a delayed but sustained activation of primarily relb-containing nf-κb dimmers  <cit> . the legionella type iv effector legk <dig> has been recently reported to process p <dig> into p <dig>  <cit> . the dominant negative mutants of nik and ikkα inhibited il- <dig> promoter activation by l. pneumophila in jurkat cells. furthermore, l. pneumophila infection induced p <dig> processing into p <dig> subunit, although supershift experiments did not reveal that the nf-κb-dna binding complexes in jurkat cells infected with l. pneumophila involve p <dig> and relb. further basic investigations with knockout and knockdown experiments will be essential in exploring the involvement of nik-dependent alternative nf-κb pathway in l. pneumophila flagellin-induced il- <dig> expression in t cells.

recently, infection with l. pneumophila has been shown to induce a biphasic activation of nf-κb in human epithelial cells:  early in infection, bacterial flagellin induces signaling of tlr <dig> and a transient translocation of p <dig> into the nucleus and  at later time points, an unknown factor that depends on bacterial replication and a functional dot/icm system induces continuous nuclear localization of p <dig> and permanent degradation of iκbα  <cit> . certainly, il- <dig> mrna expression was induced immediately after the infection, but became gradually weaker from  <dig> to  <dig> h after infection with the doto mutant in jurkat cells. l. pneumophila could also induce biphasic activation of nf-κb in t cells. the dot/icm system was demonstrated to be necessary for nf-κb activation in infections of human macrophages  <cit> . furthermore, the corby strain was shown to have a severely reduced dot/icm-dependent nf-κb activation  <cit> . therefore, the flaa mutant derived from corby strain might be deficient in infecting t cells to produce il- <dig>  in addition to flagellin, the dot/icm system might also be necessary for nf-κb activation and subsequent upregulation of il- <dig> gene in infections of t cells.

in addition to nf-κb activation, mapks have also been implicated in the induction of il- <dig> production  <cit> . the data presented here showing that all three mapks  were consistently activated upon infection with l. pneumophila in t cells, are in agreement with those published by several groups who have also reported l. pneumophila-dependent activation of these mapks in macrophages and lung epithelial cells  <cit> . however, p <dig> and jnk activation is flagellin-independent in macrophages  <cit> . legionella deficient in the dot/icm system failed to activate p <dig> and jnk in macrophages  <cit> . in lung epithelial cells, deletion of the dot/icm did not alter il- <dig> production, whereas lack of flagellin reduced il- <dig> release by legionella, although flagellin- and dot/icm-dependency of mapks activation was not analyzed  <cit> . it is likely that l. pneumophila flagellin provides signals to t cells as in lung epithelial cells since the flaa mutant failed to activate mapks in t cells. while it is clear from this report that blockade of p <dig> with specific inhibitors but not that of erk, diminishes il- <dig> mrna expression and release in lung epithelial cells  <cit> , the precise molecular mechanism underlying these inhibitions is not clear yet.

we identified both nf-κb and ap- <dig> binding sites on the 5' flanking region of the il- <dig> promoter required for maximal induction of il- <dig> by l. pneumophila. because we showed that l. pneumophila activated all three mapks, we also examined whether l. pneumophila triggers mapks-mediated il- <dig> production via activation of c-jun, jund, creb, and atf <dig>  which can bind to the ap- <dig> region in the il- <dig> promoter, as well as its cell specificity. by using specific kinase inhibitors, we also demonstrated that il- <dig> expression and production in jurkat cells was sensitive to inhibition of p <dig> and jnk but not erk. consistent with these findings, l. pneumophila stimulated phosphorylation of c-jun, creb, and atf <dig> was blocked by inhibitors of p <dig> and jnk but not erk. using dominant negative mutant proteins of p38α and p38β, we showed that l. pneumophila induction of il- <dig> was also dependent on the p <dig> pathway. jund phosphorylation can be mediated through jnk and erk pathways  <cit> . although both of these molecules were activated in response to l. pneumophila, inhibition of jnk and erk did not reduce phosphorylation of jund. further studies are needed to determine the exact kinase responsible for jund activation.

overexpression of dominant negative mutants of myd <dig> and tak <dig> inhibited l. pneumophila-induced il- <dig> activation. although we did not examine the effects of these dominant negative mutants on nf-κb and mapks activation, our results suggest that trifurcation of l. pneumophila-induced ikk-iκb, p <dig>  and mkk4-jnk signaling pathways occurs at tak <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we showed that l. pneumophila induced il- <dig> expression and subsequent production through flagellin in human t cells. in addition, the study shed new light on the signaling pathways utilized by l. pneumophila in the induction of il- <dig>  our findings support the role of ikk-iκb, p <dig>  and jnk signaling pathways in l. pneumophila induction of il- <dig> in human t cells. future studies should examine these signaling pathways in t cells of animals and patients infected with l. pneumophila, and, if the pathways are found to be significant, a targeted investigation of the role they play in host defense against l. pneumophila in infected animals should be performed.
