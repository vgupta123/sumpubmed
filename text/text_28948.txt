BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is a frequent colonizer of the human body as well as a serious human pathogen. it is known for its adaptability to diverse environments. it can cope with stress factors and acquire resistances to antibiotics thus rendering treatment difficult. s. aureus can cause a wide range of infections, mainly due to an impressive arsenal of virulence determinants comprising cell surface components and excreted factors interacting with the host system. transport of proteins to the cell surface and secretion to the extracellular space is mediated through different transport systems  <cit>  of which the general protein secretion system sec plays a prominent role in protein export and membrane insertion.

sec-mediated translocation has best been studied in escherichia coli and is catalyzed by the essential secyeg protein complex . the motor atpase seca or a translating ribosome is believed to promote protein export by driving the substrate in an unfolded conformation through the secyeg channel. the accessory secdf-yajc complex facilitates protein export and membrane protein insertion efficiency in vivo  <cit> , possibly via the control of seca cycling  <cit> . the large exoplasmic loops of the integral membrane proteins secd and secf have been shown to be required for increasing protein translocation by a yet unknown mode of action  <cit> . while secdf disruption leads to a cold-sensitive phenotype and defects in protein translocation  <cit> , the absence of yajc, which interacts with secdf, causes only a weak phenotype  <cit> . secyeg has been shown to interact with the secdf-yajc complex  <cit> . yidc, a protein that is proposed to mediate membrane integration and the assembly of multimeric complexes, can also interact with secdf-yajc to take over secyeg-dependent membrane proteins  <cit> .

data on the s. aureus sec system is scarce: seca and secy have been shown to be important, respectively essential, for growth by using antisense rna  <cit> . deletion of secg resulted in an altered composition of the extracellular proteome, which was aggravated in a secg secy <dig> double mutant  <cit> . deletion of secy <dig> alone, which together with seca <dig> belongs to the accessory sec system  <cit> , did not show any effect on protein translocation. as in the gram-positive bacterium bacillus subtilis, in s. aureus the accessory secd and secf proteins are fused to form a single protein , which was identified in membrane vesicles  <cit> . however, the chromosomal organization in s. aureus resembles the one of e. coli, with yajc lying immediately upstream of secdf. furthermore, secdf was identified in a surface-exposed peptide epitope screen by using a cell shaving technique  <cit>  and expression was found to be slightly higher in a col sigb deletion mutant  <cit> . secdf is postulated to be essential in s. aureus according to a mutagenic screen  <cit> .

secdf belongs to the resistance-nodulation-cell division  family of multidrug export pumps, that is conserved and widely distributed in all three major kingdoms of life  <cit> . rnd proteins have a wide substrate specificity and diverse functions ranging from the efflux of noxious host derived substances, such as bile salts by e. coli  <cit>  to the involvement of eukaryotic efflux pumps in cholesterol homeostasis in humans  <cit> . multiple antibiotic resistance can be associated with these exporters, as they often recognize a broad range of substrates, thereby diminishing drug accumulation in the cell  <cit> . s. aureus possesses two additional uncharacterized rnd proteins, namely sa <dig>  located downstream of the essential femx  <cit> , and sa <dig> .

RESULTS
construction of the rnd mutants
to evaluate the role and impact of the rnd proteins in s. aureus, markerless deletion mutants were constructed in the sequenced and well-characterized clinical strain newman. secdf, sa <dig> and sa <dig> were found to be dispensable, as we obtained null mutants by allelic replacement of the corresponding genes using the pkor <dig> system of bae et al.  <cit> . the mutants were confirmed to have generally retained genome stability and to carry the desired modification in the corresponding locus as described in methods.

deletion of sa <dig> and sa <dig> had no apparent effect on s. aureus when evaluating growth and resistance properties , suggesting that they may be important under other conditions than applied in this study. the following report is therefore focused on the secdf mutant and its phenotype.

transcription of secdf and growth phenotype of the secdf mutant
transcription of secdf was monitored from early exponential to early stationary phase and found to result mainly in a monocistronic mrna. secdf was strongest transcribed during early growth phase and declined towards stationary phase . as expected, no transcripts were detected in the secdf deletion mutant. transcriptional profiles were restored in the mutant by introducing the complementing plasmid pcq <dig>  containing the secdf gene from newman with its endogenous promoter .

at 37°c no significant difference was observed when comparing the growth curves of the wild type strain newman and the mutant . however, colonies of secdf mutants were smaller on blood agar compared to the wild type . tem pictures were prepared from exponentially growing cells. in contrast to the wild type  and the complemented mutant , displaying normally shaped cells with a maximum of one septum, the secdf mutant had difficulties in separating daughter cells . this resulted in clusters with sometimes multiple and wrongly placed septa. at least  <dig> cells per strain were analyzed, showing that  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the mutant cells could not divide correctly whereas this was only the case in  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for the wild type and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for the complemented mutant.

as secdf knock out mutants in b. subtilis and e. coli show a cold sensitive phenotype  <cit> , growth of the s. aureus secdf mutant was tested at 15°c. the temperature drop affected the secdf mutant approximately after two generations, causing a notably reduced growth rate with a subsequent halt in growth after  <dig> h. the plasmid pcq <dig>  but not the empty vector pcn <dig>  significantly restored growth at 15°c .

increased susceptibility of the secdf mutant towards rnd-substrates, β-lactam and glycopeptide antibiotics
since multidrug resistance can be mediated unspecifically by rnd exporters  <cit> , we characterized the resistance profile of the secdf mutant by testing several different classes of antibiotics and typical rnd-substrates  <cit> . the secdf mutant showed increased susceptibility to the rnd substrates acriflavine, ethidium bromide and sodium dodecyl sulfate  on gradient plates . furthermore, a distinct increased susceptibility to the β-lactam oxacillin and the glycopeptide vancomycin was observed . the reduction of oxacillin resistance was even more apparent in the presence of meca, the gene encoding the penicillin binding protein 2a , mediating methicillin resistance, as shown for the methicillin resistant s. aureus  strain pair newman pme <dig> and newman secdf pme <dig>   <cit> . reduction of oxacillin resistance in mrsa by secdf inactivation was confirmed in strains of different genetic backgrounds or sccmec types, such as the clinical isolate che <dig>  <cit>  and ra <dig>  <cit>  or ra <dig>  <cit>  . the complementing plasmid pcq <dig> was able to restore the wild type resistance levels.

of the four endogenous s. aureus pbps, pbp <dig> and pbp <dig> are essential, and reducing their expression lowers methicillin resistance even in the presence of the low β-lactam affinity pbp2a in mrsa  <cit> . as the sec-system can promote protein insertion into the cytoplasmic membrane, we determined whether the reduced oxacillin resistance of the secdf mutant may be related to altered pbp amounts and/or subcellular localization. staining cell membranes with the fluorescent penicillin-derivative bocillin-fl  <cit>  showed no major difference of pbp1- <dig> content in wild type mrsa background or corresponding secdf mutants . however, bocillin-fl staining did not allow the detection of the sec-type signal peptide containing pbp <dig>  <cit>  of approximately  <dig> kda, or to distinguish the exogenous pbp2a in the newman background , possibly due to low protein levels or overlap, respectively. western blots revealed comparable pbp2a and pbp <dig> amounts in the membrane fraction throughout growth, irrespective of the presence of secdf .

increased autolysis and hydrolysis in the secdf mutant
apart from functional pbps, correct separation of daughter cells requires the controlled action of autolysins and hydrolases, many of which are sec-dependent  <cit> . we therefore tested spontaneous and triton x- <dig> induced autolysis to determine if the inability of secdf mutants to separate correctly was due to altered expression of autolytic activities. both, spontaneous and triton x- <dig> induced autolysis of the secdf mutant were increased in comparison to the wild type or the complemented mutant .

to determine whether wild type and mutant bacteria produced different levels of hydrolases, their activity was analyzed in concentrated supernatant and cell wall extracts . in the supernatant of the mutant, high molecular mass bands matching different forms of the major s. aureus autolysin atl  <cit> , were expressed similarly  or even stronger  compared to the wild type and the complemented mutant . interestingly, the > <dig> kda band migrated at a slightly higher position in the mutant, corresponding to the height of the pro-atl band in the cell wall fractions, where the mutant showed overall stronger hydrolytic bands than wild type or complemented mutant.

deletion of secdf leads to altered expression of virulence factors
we qualitatively assessed the amount of various sec-dependent s. aureus virulence factors, such as coagulase, hemolysin and protease activities, as well as of the immunomodulatory protein spa to determine whether they were affected in the secdf mutant as well.

supernatant from newman and the complemented secdf mutant coagulated rabbit plasma after  <dig> min, whereas the secdf mutant required  <dig> min, suggesting production of slightly reduced coagulase levels. extracellular proteolytic activity seemed to be absent in the secdf mutant, even after five days of incubation, whereas cultures from newman and the complemented mutant showed distinct proteolytic halos on skim milk agar after  <dig> h . hemolysis activity was tested by a similar agar diffusion assay as used for protease activity determination. overnight cultures, or sterile-filtrated culture supernatants, were dispensed into holes on sheep blood agar. newman and the complemented secdf mutant showed the same extent of hemolysis. in the secdf background hemolysis was reduced when bacteria grew on the rim of agar holes , but was increased when the hemolytic activity of sterile supernatant from liquid cultures was tested . sessile or planktonic growth affects regulatory mechanisms, which can alter the expression of virulence factors such as hla  <cit> . here we found that the deletion of secdf had divergent effects on hemolysin expression depending on the growth conditions, most likely by affecting regulatory processes.

spa is one of the proteins predicted to be attached to the cell wall by sortase following export  <cit> . spa levels were determined in subcellular fractions during growth by western blot analyses.

compared to the wild type, spa levels were reduced in the cell wall and the cytoplasmic fraction, but slightly increased in the cell membrane fraction of the secdf mutant . the spa levels were similar in the supernatant. processed spa has a molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda in strain newman as estimated by western blot analysis of wild type and Δspa protein extracts . larger bands  in the wild type supernatant fraction most likely represent spa still attached to cell wall fragments. thus, spa translocation and/or processing seemed to be affected by the secdf deletion, a phenotype that could be complemented by introducing pcq <dig> .

surprisingly, secreted spa amounts were fairly constant despite this translocation defect. also in the wild type, spa levels in the supernatant were constant, whereas the amount of cell wall-bound spa increased during growth, suggesting constant shedding of this protein.

transcriptional analyses of virulence factors reveal regulatory changes in the secdf mutant
to determine whether the altered protein levels in the secdf mutant reflected also the mrna level, transcription of atl , coa , hla  hld  and spa  were examined at different growth phases. atl transcription was elevated in the mutant during the entire growth  which is in agreement with the increased hydrolytic activities observed . transcription of coa sharply decreased after od <dig> of  <dig>  slightly lower transcription levels were seen for coa in the secdf mutant , which is in line with our findings for its coagulation properties. as newman carries a prophage in the hlb gene  <cit>  and the gamma toxin is inhibited by sulfonated polymers in agar  <cit> , we only looked at the transcription of the genes encoding α and δ toxins. hla amounts in the mutant were reduced compared to the wild type . the transcription pattern of hld, contained in the major regulatory rnaiii, had a tendency to being slightly reduced in the mutant but still showed a growth phase dependent expression, starting at od <dig>  <dig> . a striking difference was observed for the spa transcription, which in the wild type increased over growth with a peak at od <dig>  <dig>  but was drastically reduced in the secdf mutant . these findings were in contrast to the observed higher hemolytic activities and spa amounts in the supernatant , which either suggests increased stability or reduced degradation of these proteins in the secdf mutant.

discussion
efflux pumps play an important role in s. aureus resistance, virulence and pathogenicity. yet the impact of the rnd family of efflux pumps in staphylococcal resistance and fitness is still open . to our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate their role in s. aureus.

we found secdf to contribute probably in part indirectly to resistance against several substances, including β-lactams and glycopeptides, making it an interesting target for increasing the efficacy of these standard antibiotics. in contrast sa <dig> and sa <dig> seemed not to be required for growth and resistance under the conditions tested. banerjee et al. recently had found a conservative amino acid mutation in sa <dig> in a high-level β-lactam resistant meca-negative strain  <cit> . however in that strain pbp <dig> and sa <dig> were also mutated and the exact reason for the observed resistance phenotype was not identified.

resistance against cell wall active antibiotics and cell separation is dependent on a tightly balanced regulation of cell wall synthetic and hydrolytic enzymes, including their timely localization to the septum  <cit> . the amount of pbps 1- <dig> and pbp2a was apparently not influenced, suggesting that other factors important for cell division and β-lactam resistance were affected. the increased hydrolytic activity in the secdf mutant may explain the observed differences in cell wall production and separation. overproduction of a hydrolase has been observed to affect formation of the ftsz-ring in mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> . this cytoskeleton structure recruits the other cell division proteins to the site of future cell separation. a similar indirect effect in the secdf mutant might have lead to an incorrect localization of the cell division machinery, including pbps , thereby causing reduced resistance against the cell wall active antibiotics oxacillin and vancomycin. the difference in atl processing might have impeded proper cell separation in addition.

like e. coli and b. subtilis secdf mutants  <cit> , the s. aureus secdf mutant displayed a cold-sensitive phenotype. in e. coli and b. subtilis secdf has furthermore been shown to participate in membrane integration and secretion of proteins  <cit> . in s. aureus many physiological functions were affected by the secdf deletion. analysis of the secretion of classical s. aureus virulence factors containing a sec-type signal peptide revealed a complex picture. coagulase and proteases were reduced in the supernatant in the secdf mutant. however, hemolysin activity under planktonic growth conditions was increased in the mutant, as was the case for  hydrolases, indicating that the secdf deletion did not lead to an overall reduction, but to an altered secretion and processing of proteins. in contrast hemolysin activity was reduced during sessile growth indicating that the deletion of secdf may have effects on overall metabolism.

spa seemed to be impaired in reaching its destined subcellular localization. in the secdf mutant spa accumulated in the membrane, was reduced in the cell wall fraction but was found in increased amounts in the supernatant. altered secretion and processing of spa might be due to impaired cell wall anchoring by the membrane protein sortase. however, mazmanian et al. have shown that the extracellular enterotoxin b fused to the sorting signal of spa accumulates in the cytoplasm and to a lesser extent in the membrane in a sortase mutant  <cit> . thus, spa might migrate by an alternate mechanism into the supernatant, circumventing linking to the peptidoglycan.

a similar divergent effect on protein secretion as we observed in the secdf mutant was found in a secg mutant. there spa was found in increased amounts in the exoproteome, despite unaffected transcription  <cit> . in contrast, we found deletion of secdf to change mrna levels for many of the analyzed genes, such as atl, coa, hla, hld and spa. the lack of secdf therefore seems to have a different impact on virulence factor expression than secg, influencing, most likely indirectly, transcription in addition to translocation. the absence of secdf could especially cause a defective or reduced membrane insertion of sensor proteins belonging to one of the numerous s. aureus two component systems contributing to virulence factor regulation and to adaptations to different growth conditions . the reduced hld levels in the mutant suggests that the secdf deletion affected at least one two component system by impairing signaling via the agr quorum sensor  <cit> .

this study and the work of sibbald et al.  <cit>  once more demonstrate that protein and mrna levels do not necessarily correlate. specific regulation at the protein level has been shown for certain transcription factors in s. aureus  <cit> . such a control of protein stability via chaperones and proteases might exist as well for virulence factors. interestingly, in e. coli, secy, yidc and secd mutants were shown to induce the cpx system, which up-regulates the expression of factors involved in folding and proteolysis in response to abnormal proteins in the outer membrane, the periplasmic space or the plasma membrane  <cit> . the induction of similar systems in the s. aureus secdf mutant due to clogging of the membrane, as suggested by the increased amounts of spa in this compartment, could be an additional factor influencing protein stability and lead to the partially incoherent mrna and protein levels, as seen for hla, hld and spa during planktonic growth.

CONCLUSIONS
this work provides evidence that although secdf is dispensable in s. aureus, its deletion leads to a pleiotropic phenotype. lack of secdf affected cell separation, resistance and virulence factor expression showing that this conserved rnd protein plays a major role in the important human pathogen s. aureus. thus secdf could be a potential therapeutic target rendering s. aureus more susceptible to the currently available antibiotics.
