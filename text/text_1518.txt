BACKGROUND
filamentous cyanobacteria contain molecular machines for oxygenic photosynthesis under all growth conditions  <cit> . these machines, as well as those involved in respiration and nitrogen metabolism, depend on non-proteinaceous cofactors such as iron  <cit> . the level of iron found in cyanobacteria is generally one order of magnitude higher than in non-photosynthetic bacteria  <cit>  and represents about  <dig> % of their biomass  <cit> . even though iron and copper are required for the function of respiratory and photosynthetic complexes, their intracellular level has to be tightly controlled as these ions pose a risk of oxidation  <cit> . therefore, the uptake of iron is highly regulated in order to avoid intoxication. on the other hand, it is hypothesized that iron limitation might have been one of the selective forces in the evolution of cyanobacteria  <cit> , and one might speculate that those cyanobacteria with the most efficient iron uptake systems might have had an evolutionary advantage. to enhance iron uptake, eubacteria secrete low-molecular-weight iron chelators  under iron-limiting conditions to complex environmental iron  <cit> . the siderophore-iron complexes are bound by receptor proteins  in the outer membrane which are composed of a transmembrane β-barrel domain, a so-called plug domain and a periplasmic exposed tonb box. the siderophore-iron is subsequently transferred to the cytoplasm by transport proteins in the cytoplasmic membrane  <cit> . this process is dependent on tonb which provides the energy required for the translocation of siderophore-iron complexes across the outer membrane  <cit> . in order to facilitate this translocation, the periplasmic domain of tonb interacts with the tonb box of the loaded tbdt. it is proposed that tonb exerts a pulling force on the tonb box and, thereby, partially unfolds the plug domain enabling the translocation of the siderophore into the periplasmic space  <cit> . several tbdts have been identified. beside the ones for iron transport  <cit> , tbdts for nickel  <cit> , disaccharides , oligo- , polysaccharides  or large degradation products of proteins  are described. the most intensively studied function of tbdts is the iron uptake in gram-negative bacteria. three large classes are defined, namely transferrin-/lactoferrin-binding proteins, porphyrin and siderophore transporters  <cit> . in addition to the transport of iron across the outer membrane by tbdts, an additional ferric iron uptake system is postulated, but the corresponding outer membrane receptor has not yet been identified  <cit> . the tbdts tbpa  and lbpa  facilitate the uptake of iron from transferrin/lactoferrin, respectively; the uptake is also assisted by the lipoproteins tbpb and lbpb which face the extracellular side  <cit> . the porphyrin-transporting tbdts include hasr, hgba, hmbr  and btub which transports the cobalt-complexing vitamin b <dig> . heme uptake is especially important in bacterial pathogens, where various heme-containing compounds are utilized  <cit> . the siderophore tbdts are further sub-classified according to their substrate - that is the chemical nature of the siderophore they bind. siderophores belong inter alia to hydroxamates, catecholates, phenolates, citrates or combinations thereof  <cit> . for example, the siderophore transporters fepa, viua and iron recognize catecholates, fhua, foxa and fhue hydroxamate and feca citrate.

the iron uptake system in cyanobacteria is not well understood. for the non-filamentous cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> the tbdts encoded by sll <dig>  sll <dig>  sll <dig> and slr <dig> were partially characterized  <cit> . for filamentous cyanobacteria such as anabaena sp. pcc  <dig>  only siderophore secretion  <cit> , and the influence of enhanced or reduced iron levels on the growth  <cit> , were investigated. anabaena sp. pcc  <dig> secretes the hydroxamate-type siderophore schizokinen, allegedly the only siderophore secreted  <cit> . only recently, a tbdt encoded by scht  involved in the uptake of schizokinen was identified. the expression of the gene scht  was mildly increased under a shortage of fe3+. a scht knock-out mutant showed a moderate phenotype of iron starvation, and the characterization of its siderophore-dependent iron uptake demonstrated the function of scht as a tonb-dependent schizokinen transporter  <cit> .

to learn more about iron transport systems in general and in cyanobacteria particularly we searched for genes coding for tbdts based on previously experimentally characterized tbdts. subsequently, we assigned putative substrates for so far uncharacterized tbdts, according to their sequence similarity to already known tbdts. we observed a substantial difference in the number of tbdt genes in the analysed cyanobacteria. the expression pattern of the tbdt genes in anabaena sp. pcc  <dig> is analysed with respect to iron, copper and nitrogen availability.

RESULTS
classification of tonb-dependent transporters
ninety-eight tbdts and the  substrates  were extracted from the published literature   <cit> . in order to classify the tbdts with unknown substrates, we first searched for putative tbdts in  <dig> sequenced genomes. we identified  <dig> putative tbdts in  <dig> species . compared to previously published bioinformatic analyses  <cit> , we identified fewer sequences in the species which had been analysed in the past due to a more stringent cutoff . more specifically, within the species analysed by koebnik, we selected seven sequences not previously identified, but did not consider  <dig> sequences  <cit> . a similar ratio was found when analysing the number of sequences selected by us from the species analysed by blanvillain et al. , who selected  <dig> sequences which resulted in a discrepancy of about 5%.

we subsequently performed a cluster analysis of the identified sequences of putative tbdts  leading to  <dig> clusters with at least two sequences. figure 1a shows the consensus tree used to highlight 'regions' on the two-dimensional sequence landscape. a region is marked by roman numerals if the substrate for at least one tbdt in this region is experimentally verified  or predicted , and marked by upper case letters if no substrate tbdt in the region is known . figure 1b shows the exptbdt regions i-vii, xi, xii and xiii and the ptbdts regions viii, ix and x together with the uncharacterized regions a-n. figure  <dig> shows an enlarged version of the dashed rectangle in figure 1b. the colours describe the substrate that binds to the corresponding tbdts. figure  <dig>  shows a magnification of the exptbdts regions, where the numbers refer to sequences with a known substrate . in the following, we characterize the regions according to the  <dig> tbdts that have been experimentally verified or predicted .

region i
this consists of  <dig> clusters with at least five sequences and  <dig> of them have assigned functions which include porphyrin, lacto-/transferrin and nickel transporters . cluster  <dig> contains the sequence of the copper chelate binding protein oprc . a group of clusters  are comprised of heme-transporting  proteins. remarkably, the two enterobactin  transporters vcta  and feta  are located within the porphyrin group. this finding corroborates the observation that vcta and feta are, supposedly, involved in transporting porphyrin  <cit> . in cluster  <dig>  the lbpa or tbpa proteins are found . there is also a small cluster  which contains nickel-transporting tbdts with a single exptbdt .

region ii
this contains  <dig> clusters, three of them represented by exptbdts . in cluster  <dig> the experimentally confirmed cobalt-complexing vitamin b <dig> transporter btub  is present. however, in the same cluster, and in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  predicted btubs were identified . cluster  <dig> contains irga, bfra or iron sequences  transporting enterobactin, dhbs  or salmochelin . in addition, a myxochelin  transporter  occurs in region ii.

region iii
cluster  <dig> is defined by sequences of the aerobactin/rhizobactin  transporters iuta and rhta .

region iv
the largest cluster in region iv  contains the sequences of the ferric rhizoferrin  transporter ruma and the diferric dicitrate transporter feca .

region v 
this consists of nine clusters with three  of them containing exptbdts and two ptbdts . this region mainly contains transporters for hydroxamate-type siderophores, such as desferrioxamine , ferrichrome , pseudobactin a , pyochelin , or anguibactin . interestingly, the proteins for which sequences are found in cluster  <dig>  are predicted to transport thiamin, whereas proteins  <dig> and  <dig>  are predicted to transport vitamin b <dig>  the latter appears to be a false prediction as judged from the large distance to cluster  <dig> containing the experimentally confirmed btub. setting an even lower p-value  as the threshold for defining the clusters in clans leads to cluster  <dig> splitting up in the upper part with all hydroxamate-type tbdts  and the lower part containing phenolate-transporting tbdts and vcia, which has been shown to transport neither heme, vibriobactin, enterobactin, ferrioxamine b, aerobactin nor shizokinen  <cit> .

region vi
this region represents transporters for phenolates, catecholates or hexylsulfate and contains several clusters. a hexylsulfate transporting tbdt  can be found in cluster  <dig>  a vibriobactin  transporter  in cluster  <dig> and proteins transporting yersiniabactin  in cluster  <dig>  as already observed in region v, we also detected two sequences  in cluster  <dig> that are putative thiamin transporters.

region vii 
cluster  <dig> contains suxa , an experimentally verified sucrose transporter. please note, that sequence  <dig> has been predicted to transport sucrose  <cit> . the prediction was based on the co-localization of the corresponding gene with the transcriptional regulator scrr. thus, our bioinformatic analysis provides additional evidence for the functional characterization.

region viii 
this region contains predicted nickel and cobalt tbdts with unknown metallophore specificity and no representative of the exptbdts.

region ix
this consists of eight sequences in one cluster , where two of the eight are putative thiamin transporters. however, proteins assigned as thiamin transporters were also found in regions v  and vi . their genes are co-localized on the genome with a cytoplasmic membrane transporter for thiamin , however, the functional assignment remains to be proven.

region x
this contains a tbdt predicted to transport cobalt-complexing vitamin b <dig> . however, it is far away from the btub cluster in region ii . hence, the assigned function should be experimentally confirmed.

region xi
the region is clearly separated from the rest and contains cluster  <dig>  the experimentally characterized tbdts include oligosaccharide , polysaccharide transporters  and transporters for degradation products of proteins . while many taxa are represented by sequences in the region i-x, region xi consists almost exclusively of bacteroidetes with the exception of one δ-proteobacterial sequence . thus, sequences in this region may indicate a special adaptation of these organisms, which may be due to their lifestyle. bacteroidetes are involved in food digestion in the intestinal tract of mammals. hence a specific tbdt class for the uptake of substrates provided by the host seems plausible.

region xii
this also appears as an outlier . it contains eight clusters  and only one exptbdt mala  that transports maltodextrin. seven ptbdts are said to transport xylan, pectin or chito-oligosaccharides , where sequences 91- <dig> belong to cluster  <dig> and sequence  <dig> to cluster  <dig>  it appears that this region is composed of di- and oligosaccharide transporters. in line with this notion, the δ-proteobacterial tbdts are from myxobacteria , which are found on decaying plant material consuming their saccharides. most of the sequences in this region stem from α- and γ-proteobacteria  and a few bacteroidetes, δ- and β-proteobacteria taxa.

region xiii
positioned between region xi and the crowded area on the right side, this region is defined by a fibronectin-binding tbdt . as in most of the sequences in region xi, the sequences of this region consist almost exclusively of bacteroidetes. the close proximity of regions xi and xiii is consistent with the observed interaction of the tbdt with a glycoprotein.

other regions
for regions i to xiii we were in the lucky position of being able to infer at least putative functions to ~ <dig> sequences.  however, from the  <dig> sequences from genbank ~ <dig> sequences remain in regions a-n, where we were unable to assign any function . while we cannot discuss potential substrates for clusters in regions a-n, we can at least point to some regions that show a peculiar taxonomic composition. in regions a and b sequences from mostly γ-  and α-proteobacteria , but also a few β-proteobacterial  and bacteroidetes , are present. region c contains exclusively γ-proteobacterial sequences.

classification of tonb-dependent transporters in cyanobacteria
one of our aims was the identification and classification of cyanobacterial tbdts. hence we searched for sequences of putative tbdts in  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes . we additionally extracted the automated annotation from genbank . at present, this annotation is mostly limited to cira, fhue or btub. hence, we analysed the location of cyanobacterial sequences on the clans plot . all cyanobacterial tbdts belong to regions with experimentally characterized tbdts . to further confirm the classification determined with clans we also constructed a phylogenetic tree for the cyanobacterial sequences . seven 'subtrees'  were identified and mapped to regions i-x.

alr4028
the annotation of the sequences is indicated in column  <dig>  the spot number according to figure  <dig> is indicated in column 4; the initial annotation in the database is given in column 2; the classification according to figure  <dig> using the name of a representative transporter of the related category is given in column 3; the accession code in column 5; and the source organism column  <dig> 

a.

the six sequences in subtree 'a' belong to region i  and show a relation to heme transporters such as huta . the sequences are found in synechococcus sp., acaryochloris marina and anabaena sp. pcc  <dig> . subtrees 'b' and 'c' contain only sequences from gloeobacter violaceus. subtree 'b' is within region i and is equidistant to enterobactin and heme transporters. thereby, a clear assignment to a characterized tbdt family appears currently impossible. subtree 'd' is close to the btub transporter cluster  . in this region we find sequences from most of the analysed cyanobacteria , suggesting that transporters with similarity to btub are common. subtree 'e'  represents transporters, which can clearly be assigned as specific for aerobactin/rhizobactin . subtree 'f' represents sequences of transporters with the closest relation to fhua-type transporters of cluster  <dig>  the sequences of subtree 'g' , closely related to viua, are probably transporters for catecholates. the sequences of subtree 'g' are also close to cluster  <dig>  which contains putative thiamin transporters. nevertheless, since the two putative thiamin transporters have not yet been experimentally confirmed, we consider these cyanobacterial tbdts to be iron transporters of the viua-type.

summarizing, the assignment of the cyanobacterial tbdts to regions with functional characterization was successful with the exception of some tbdts from gloeobacter violaceus . although btub-like transporters and hydroxamate-type metallophore transporters were found in cyanobacteria, we did not find feca-type  tbdts, even though they occur in α-, β-, γ-, δ- and ε-proteobacteria, bacteroidetes and spirochaetes.

identification of tbdts in anabaena sp. pcc 7120
in order to explore the cyanobacterial tbdts in more detail we analysed the full genome of anabaena sp. pcc  <dig>  we identified  <dig> tbdt genes carrying the plug domain and β-barrel domain characteristic for tbdts. in addition, we identified four genes  containing the plug domain of the tbdt, but an incomplete β-barrel domain. downstream of all <dig>  and alr <dig>  a gene coding for the 'missing part' of the β-barrel domain is present . consequently, we checked the stop codon separating the two gene pairs. we confirmed the stop codon between all <dig> and all <dig>  and could not identify a frame shift in the sequence of the region  <dig> bp upstream or downstream of the stop codon. if all <dig> is, indeed, part of a tbdt it has to form a heterodimer. a putative interaction partner would be all <dig>  it would, therefore, be interesting to investigate the existence of such complex and to understand whether it is just a remnant of a genetic accident which led to a split of the tbdt gene in all <dig> and all <dig>  in contrast to all <dig> and all <dig>  for alr <dig> and alr <dig> we found a t to c exchange in the sequence when comparing our results with that of the deposited sequence. hence, we conclude that the stop codon does not exist and that the two genes alr <dig> and alr <dig> encode one protein. therefore,  <dig> tbdts exist in anabaena sp. pcc  <dig> 

for  <dig> tbdts the genomic organization suggests the integration of the gene in an operon . twelve tbdts are directly positioned behind a gene coding for a  transcriptional regulator , and most of the  operon structures contain genes coding for proteins involved in iron transport. the gene coding for a viua-type transporter is in a putative operon with subunits of a cytochrome d ubiquinol oxidase, which is rather unexpected, because, to date, a relation between this oxidase and iron transport has not been reported . of the btub transporters one is a single gene , whereas the other  is in a rather typical genomic environment, namely in front of three genes encoding the periplasmic and the plasma membrane localized iron transport machinery. the same holds true for the huta-like gene alr <dig>  the other huta-like gene  is in a putative operon with a gene encoding a tetracenomycin c synthesis protein and a gene of unknown function. again, the relation between the tbdt and the downstream genes are rather questionable.

three genes are classified as iuta-like. alr <dig>  is single standing in the genome. downstream of alr <dig> we found two genes coding for an unknown protein and a dicitrate binding protein, respectively. alr <dig> is a component of a large genomic region  containing upstream a transcription regulator and downstream a cluster with three genes coding for periplasmic dicitrate binding proteins and one fhua-like gene . thirteen of the  <dig> fhua-like genes are upstream of a gene coding for a protein annotated as dicitrate-binding. however, most of the genes found in the putative operons defined by the  <dig> fhua-like genes encode for proteins of unknown function. three of the fhua-like genes  are in the same chromosomal region. upstream of these, a gene coding a transcription regulator and downstream a gene encoding a dicitrate binding protein are found. however, the phylogenetic analysis  argues against recent gene duplication.

variations of the number of genes encoding tbdts in cyanobacteria
the results presented in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and table  <dig> show that the number of tbdts varies among cyanobacteria. we found  <dig> tbdts in anabaena sp. pcc  <dig>   <dig> in anabaena variabilis, six in synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig>  four in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>   <dig> in gloeobacter violaceus, but no tbdts in the genomes of, for example, prochlorococcus). this variation of the number of genes, however, does not reflect an elevated amount of outer membrane protein coding genes in anabaena sp. pcc  <dig>  because such a variation is not found for other outer membrane proteins . furthermore, in a previous report, a correlation of the number of tbdts to the number of open reading frames as, for example, for transporters in the cytoplasmic membrane  <cit>  was not observed  <cit> , which is supported by our analysis .

tbdts are regulated by tonb proteins. hence, the large number of tbdts leads to the question of whether each tbdt is regulated individually or  in concert by one tonb protein. we, therefore, screened the genomes for the presence of tonb . one to three tonb genes were detected. hence, the number of tbdts largely exceeds the number of tonb proteins. please note that we identified a tonb-like protein  in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  which corrects a previous statement excluding the presence of a tonb-like protein in this species  <cit> .

expression of genes in anabaena sp. coding for tbdts
we analysed the gene expression of the  <dig> tdbt genes and of all <dig>  which only codes for the n-terminal portion of a tbdt  in anabaena sp. pcc  <dig> . to this end, anabaena sp. pcc  <dig> was grown in normal medium , medium without iron , medium without copper  or medium lacking both . the presence of transcript was then determined by non-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction . iron and copper were chosen, because iron is known to be involved in the regulation of the gene expression of tbdts and copper was recently found to induce an expression of a gene cluster involved in siderophore synthesis  <cit> . remarkably,  <dig> tbdt-gene transcripts were present under normal growth conditions in such amounts that they could be amplified and visualized by rt-pcr . it should be noted that the absence of a transcript for the other genes might only reflect low transcript abundance. for  <dig> genes, we detected transcripts under fe minus or/cu minus conditions . the analysis of the detection pattern revealed the following:  the genes all <dig> and all <dig>  both hydroxamate-type tbdts, were down-regulated upon iron and/or copper starvation compared to transcript levels under normal conditions;  the expression of seven genes  not detected under normal growth conditions is increased in response to copper, but not iron, limitation in the bg <dig> medium . this is notable, because, for four of these seven genes, the expression in the absence of one metal-ion  is higher than in the absence of both iron and copper. one viua-like gene  is expressed at a low level in bg <dig>  but not in bg <dig> deficient of iron. an exclusive dependence of  expression in bg <dig> medium on iron limitation was only observed for alr <dig>  and all <dig> .

finally, we investigated the expression pattern of tdbts under conditions enforcing heterocyst formation by growth in medium without a nitrogen source . we again analysed the amount of transcript in the four different media. strikingly, in bg <dig> medium  <dig> genes are expressed  but seven of them are not expressed in bg <dig>  moreover, we found four genes - alr <dig> and alr <dig> ,alr <dig> and alr <dig>  - for which a transcript was detected only under additional metal starvation . remarkably, all <dig> is expressed under all conditions without a nitrogen source, which suggests that all <dig> is not a pseudogene. in general, one can conclude that not only metal starvation but also nitrogen starvation induces transcription of tbdt-encoding genes in anabaena sp. pcc  <dig> 

as only all <dig> encodes a tonb-like protein in anabaena sp. pcc  <dig> we analysed its expression under the conditions outlined . as expected, all <dig> transcript can be detected under all conditions tested. assuming that the function of all identified tbdts in anabaena sp. depends on tonb, all <dig> is required for iron homeostasis in general.

CONCLUSIONS
by clustering ~ <dig>  tbdts we found that they group by their substrate and not according to their taxonomy with the exception of regions ix, xi, xiii and c. the latter are specific for sequences from bacteroidetes and γ-proteobacteria, respectively. hence, the transported molecule dominates the sequence variation among tbdts. according to the occurrence of exptbdts within clusters, we were able to assign a tentative substrate for almost two-thirds of the analysed sequences. we have developed a website for a further detailed inspection of the clustering of individual sequences . here, the individual clusters or sequences can be highlighted based on the presentation in figure  <dig>  however, the current assignment has to be viewed with care as schauer and colleagues pointed out that further substrates might be discovered in future  <cit> , which will then be introduced into the web interface. we identified several clusters of tbdts with putatively so far unknown substrates. further research on a few candidate proteins of each of these clusters would be of great interest, as it would significantly advance the knowledge on substrate uptake by bacteria on the protein level and it might also reveal new potential drug targets.

large differences to previously suggested classifications were not observed for iron-transporting tbdts. generally, our approach resembles previous classifications of tbdts according to their substrates based on a smaller number of sequences and a phylogenetic tree reconstruction  <cit> , but the positioning of the iuta and of the viua sequences differs with respect to distances previously proposed  <cit> . in contrast to the report by levier and guerinot who placed viua between the lactoferrin and transferrin recognizing transporters  <cit> , we found that viua  clearly clusters with fyua  sequences. this discrepancy might reflect the fact that:  more sequences of tbdts are available nowadays; and  the methodology to analyse sequence relationships has improved.

a deviation from this general picture was found for the predicted btubs, which are spread over a long stripe from regions ii to v. hence, btubs might show a similar diffuse distribution pattern like the heme and hydroxamate transporters . the predicted btubs might, therefore, transport substrates only structurally related to cobalt-complexing vitamin b <dig> 

tbdts in anabaena sp
based on database searches, we have identified  <dig> sequences with tonb-box signature  <cit>  leading to  <dig> sequences coding for putative tbdts in anabaena sp. pcc  <dig> . strikingly, at least five different types of transporters are identified  and this number greatly exceeds the number of genes coding for tbdts of almost all other  cyanobacteria with the exception of gloeobacter violaceus. in turn, this is the only species for which some of the tbdts could not be functionally assigned. as already discussed, it has been hypothesized that iron limitation might have been one of the selective forces in evolution of cyanobacteria. gloeobacter violaceus  was isolated in  <dig> from a calcareous rock near the vierwaldstättersee in switzerland, whereas anabaena variablis  was isolated in  <dig> from fresh water of the mississippi, usa. both strains are considered non-symbiotic. g. violaceus is rather unique with respect to the absence of thylakoid structure and does not form filaments  <cit>  like synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> , which was isolated from fresh water in california and deposited in the pasteur collection in  <dig> . hence, the number of tbdts does not correlate with filament or heterocyst formation. it might, however, correlate with the habitat from which the species were isolated, with respect to either species competition for iron or iron limitations in the environment per se. therefore, symbiotic cyanobacteria such as nostoc punctiforme may possibly contain a rather low number of tbdts because iron is provided by the host. unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, the source of anabaena sp. strain pcc  <dig> - formerly named nostoc muscorum isu  - is unknown and it is considered to be a 'free living cyanobacterium'. the observation that this cyanobacterium is susceptible to viruses isolated from the lake mendota, dane county, wisconsin, usa,  <cit>  might suggest that a similar environment was its place of isolation. this would be in line with an original natural habitat of anabaena sp. pcc  <dig> that contained rather limited iron sources, because it has been reported that the iron concentration in rivers is higher than in lakes . the variety of tbdt classes found in anabaena sp. rather agrees with iron limited environmental conditions. the only tbdt type which could not be identified in the analysed cyanobacterial species, in general, and, thereby, also in anabaena sp. pcc  <dig>  is the feca-type  which can be found in many other bacteria. to date, schizokinen is the only confirmed siderophore which is secreted by anabaena sp. pcc  <dig>  <cit>  and, recently, its transporter was identified  <cit> . however, additional siderophores are secreted by anabaena sp.  <cit> , but they have not yet been characterized. nevertheless, other interpretations for the variable number of tbdts might still be possible.

the environment influences the expression of tbdt genes in anabaena sp
in line with iron limitation in the native environment, several differential expression regulation regimes have been observed. for instance, six out of  <dig> genes encoding hydroxamate recognizing fhua-like transporters are expressed under  all tested conditions . the same holds true for one btub-like transporter encoded by all <dig>  which is in accordance with its identification in a proteome analysis of cells grown under standard conditions  <cit> . interestingly, the other btub-like transporter encoded by the joint gene all4028/all <dig> is only expressed under iron-limiting conditions . furthermore, the iuta-like genes are always expressed under nitrogen-limiting conditions, whereas huta-like genes are only expressed upon metal starvation . also, for the gene encoding the schizokinen transporter scht  only a moderate and intermediate influence of iron starvation on expression was observed  <cit> . the gene encoding the only putative catecholate transporter  appears to be expressed under non-limiting conditions as well as after nitrogen starvation. to our surprise, we did not observe a transcript under iron limitation but under copper limitation in bg <dig> or in the absence of both metals in bg <dig> and bg <dig>  such a clear relation to copper starvation was detected for four fhua-type transporters as well . the relation between the expression of genes encoding for tbdts in anabaena sp. and copper agrees with the recent observation that genes involved in siderophore production are also induced by copper starvation  <cit> . nevertheless, the components of the network regulating the expression of tbdt encoding genes still need to be identified. even though a complex network of tbdts was discovered, only a single tonb protein was found in 58% of gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . the gene is expressed under all tested conditions and, hence, it has to be considered as a master 'regulator' of the large group of tbdts.
