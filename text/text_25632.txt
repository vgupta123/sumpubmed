BACKGROUND
microsatellites or simple sequence repeats , defined as loci comprising tandem repeats of  <dig>  to  <dig> base pairs, are ubiquitous both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes  <cit> . historically described as “junk” dna, the role of ssrs in evolution has been re-evaluated by recent findings thanks to the great expansion of genomic research  <cit> . these peculiar sequences show high rate of reversible mutation in length, ranging from 10− <dig> to 10− <dig> number of mutations per generation, which is higher than the average genomic rate of point mutations normally evaluated at 10−8–10− <dig>  <cit> . mutation rate can be affected by motif length, motif sequence, number of repeats, and imperfection of ssrs   <cit> . it has been demonstrated that ssrs are distributed non-randomly in genomes, probably because of their varied effects on functions including chromatin organization, gene activity regulation, dna replication and recombination, cell cycle, and mismatch repair system  <cit> . within eukaryotes, each species may have a distinct motif frequency distribution  <cit> .

for all of the abovementioned reasons, ssrs are powerful and widely used genetic markers. their co-dominant nature and high levels of polymorphisms make them invaluable for genotyping purposes as well as for standard population genetic analyses. their presumed stepwise evolution pattern can also be utilized to study how diversity is generated when invasive populations are started from one or a few founder genotypes, as it has been done for the pathogen causing the sudden oak death epidemic  <cit> . moreover, some ssrs are hypervariable, allowing studies of evolution and genetic structure of clonal species or populations. while several approaches have been extensively used to isolate ssr loci  <cit> , the availability of an annotated genome is the most powerful approach to identify ssrs and to study their distribution, type, and evolution. presence and extent of ssrs variability is likely to be affected by several factors including reproductive behaviour, effective size and age of populations, and other intrinsic factors linked to dna replication and transcription. it has been postulated that ssrs may have a role in modulating gene expression  <cit> : the type and frequency of ssrs in regions known to be responsible for gene regulation may corroborate such a role, and may also allow for the better understanding of general genomic patterns of evolution and variability.

even though ssr loci have been extensively described as part of the annotation effort of several fungal genomes, their roles in genome shaping, and their contribution to genome evolution, are still unclear. recent studies showed that they are not randomly distributed throughout the genomes and they seem not to always follow the classical stepwise mutation based on neutral or nearly neutral theory  <cit> .

ssrs are less frequent in fungal than in other eukaryotic genomes, although each species appears to have a unique signature of repeat distribution across the kingdom fungi  <cit> . interestingly, genome size seems not to be correlated with ssr density  <cit> . in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae meyen ex e.c. hansen, it has been reported that about 75 % of predicted gene models harbouring ssrs encoded for proteins related to cell surface involved in cell adhesion and flocculation  <cit> . cumulatively, these findings suggest that in addition to contributing in genome shaping, ssrs could play active role during adaptive evolutionary processes  <cit> .

in the current work, we used the two sibling plant pathogenic fungal species heterobasidion irregulare otrosina & garbel. and h. annosum  bref. as a model system to assess how selection drives ssrs type and variability during divergent evolution processes. these species are regarded as two of the most destructive forest pathogens in north america and eurasia, respectively  <cit> . both phylogenetic and comparative genomics studies indicated that h. irregulare and h. annosum, which have retained high level of interfertility  <cit> , are monophyletic sister taxa which have diverged genetically approximately 34– <dig> millions of years  ago and evolved into distinct allopatric species . the definitive evidence on their status as distinct species was obtained recently through a phylogenomic approach comparing several h. irregulare and h. annosum genotypes  <cit> . due to the accidental introduction of h. irregulare into italy during world war ii, the two species have attained sympatry  <cit>  and started admixing their genomes  <cit> . outside of the area of sympatry, currently limited to the latium region of italy  <cit> , individuals belonging to the two species have not exchanged genes for at least 34– <dig> my  <cit> , thus allowing for a rigorous comparative analysis.

the general aims of this study were: a- to confirm that the distribution of ssrs is not random in terms of frequency of each ssr type within the fully annotated genome of h. irregulare; and, b- to corroborate the evolutionary assumptions of a non-random  distribution of ssr, by testing whether the genomic location of trimers is correlated to traits such as levels of polymorphism and homoplasy. in order to do so, a whole genome survey of ssrs in the h. irregulare genome was carried out to categorize type and location of all ssrs and to identify specific trinucleotidic ssr markers in clearly distinct genomic regions. this survey allowed us to identify ssrs located within open reading frames  or clearly upstream and downstream of 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions , respectively. coupling the ssr survey with a population genetic analysis, our specific goals were: i) to determine the distribution and identify the motifs of the different ssr categories in selected genomic regions of the h. irregulare genome, i.e. inside orfs, inside utrs, immediately upstream and downstream of utrs, as well as far from transcribed regions and to compare patterns with that of other fungal genomes; ii) to compare the amount of intraspecific and interspecific variability of trinucleotide ssrs located in the abovementioned genomic regions; and iii) to test if ssrs in different regions may evolve in concert with the region they are inserted in, resulting in loci with different analytical phylogenetic resolution due to different levels of homoplasy or constraints on number of repeats  <cit> .

RESULTS
distribution of ssrs in the h. irregulare genome
based on our search parameters, the total number of perfect ssrs was  <dig>  representing about  <dig>  % of the h. irregulare genome. there was approximately one microsatellite per  <dig>  kbp and the total numbers of ssrs in intergenic and intragenic regions were similar,  <dig> versus  <dig> .fig.  <dig> ssrs distribution across different scaffolds  of the h. irregulare reference genome. the  <dig> scaffolds corresponding to chromosomes are shown. gene density  in a window size of  <dig> kbp is colour coded from light yellow to dark red, with deeper red region representing high gene density. from outer to inner, black histograms represent distribution of hexa- , penta- , tetra- , tri- , di-  nucleotidic ssrs, respectively. histogram size represent frequency of ssrs in a window size of  <dig> kbp. figures were drawn by using circos software v.  <dig>  



chi-square test indicated that the distribution of ssrs was not random  throughout the genome. frequency of ssrs per mbp in the ten largest scaffolds was highest in 3’utr, followed by regions located more than 500 bp from utrs, regions 50 bp upstream 5’utr , 5’utr, 50 bp downstream 3’utr, 50–500 bp downstream 3’utr, introns, 50–500 bp upstream 5’utr and exons.

the most frequent ssrs in exons were trinucleotides followed by hexanucleotides, while tetranucleotides were dominant in introns . trinucleotides were also clearly dominant in 5’utrs, within 50 bp before 5’utr and in 50–500 bp upstream 5’utr. conversely, tetranucleotides were more frequent than other ssrs in the genome fraction located more than 500 bp from transcribed regions. frequencies of tri- and tetranucleotides are similar in 3’utr and 50 bp downstream 3’utr. dinucleotides were present at extremely low frequencies both in exons and within 50 bp before 5’utr. the frequency of ssrs was higher in 3’ than in 5’utrs. overall, the highest concentration of trinucleotides was found in 5’utrs and within 50 bp before 5’utr .fig.  <dig> frequency of different types of ssrs in selected genomic regions of the h. irregulare genome. frequencies were estimated as the number of ssrs per mbp

ssrs amplification and polymorphism analysis
ssrs polymorphisms were scored by analyzing  <dig> ssr loci in different genomic regions, i.e. loci localized more than 500 bp upstream from transcribed regions , loci positioned within 500–50 bp before 5’utr , loci inside exons  and loci within 50–500 bp after 3’utr . all ssr loci were polymorphic, showing  <dig> to  <dig> alleles per locus. allelic sizes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> and repeat number ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . the h. irregulare populations had a mean number of alleles of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for out loci,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for up loci,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for in loci and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for down loci. the h. annosum populations had a mean number of alleles of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for out loci,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for up loci,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for in loci and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for down loci .table  <dig> allelic diversity for the populations of h. irregulare and h. annosum. number of different alleles, number of effective alleles and number of private alleles were shown. loci localized more than 500 bp upstream from transcribed regions were referred to as out, loci positioned within 500–50 bp before 5’utr were referred to as up, loci inside exons were referred to as in and loci within 50–500 bp after 3’utr were referred to as down

population genetics analysis
amovas were performed on  <dig> heterobasidion genotypes from two h. irregulare and three h. annosum populations. results including all loci indicated that most of the genetic variability  was among genotypes within population, 3–9 % of the genetic variance was among populations within species, and 25–43 % of the molecular variance was between the two species . averaging all loci and populations, fst values were as high as  <dig>  . average fst values by each of the abovementioned categories were as follows:  <dig>  for out loci,  <dig>  for up loci,  <dig>  for in loci, and  <dig>  for down loci. details on percentage of per locus variance, as well as fst and gene flow  values, calculated considering the genotypes as haploids, are summarized in fig.  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  respectively. the genetic diversity detected with the  <dig> loci was sufficiently informative to reflect the genetic distinction between species. the pcoa showed a clear genetic differentiation between h. irregulare and h. annosum, especially when up and in loci were considered . in in loci no overlap between species was observed, while in out, up, and down loci partial overlap was observed between h. irregulare genotypes and h. annosum genotypes from the latium population  .table  <dig> hieratical analysis of molecular variance . the genetic diversity between species, among populations and among genotypes within populations of  <dig> genotypes of h. irregulare and h. annosum was shown. loci localized more than 500 bp upstream from transcribed regions were referred to as out, loci positioned within 500–50 bp before 5’utr were referred to as up, loci inside exons were referred to as in and loci within 50–500 bp after 3’utr were referred to as down. degrees of freedom  were also included

locus per locus amova showed that for two out loci , two in loci  and two down loci  the 2 nm value was over  <dig> and the fst value was less than  <dig>  . the in locus ms <dig> showed the highest variability among genotypes within populations , while the out locus ms <dig> showed the highest variability among populations . the in locus ms <dig> showed the highest value for variability between species  . the percentages of variation between species resulting from the amova varied depending on loci categories and were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for out, up, in and down loci, respectively .

discussion
distribution of ssrs in the sequenced h. irregulare genome
although the frequency of ssrs per mbp in h. irregulare was comparable between introns and exons, there was a clear and significant selection in favour of trinucleotides and hexanucleotides in exons versus introns. such dominance of triplets over other repeats in coding regions may be explained on the basis of the suppression of nontrimeric ssrs in coding regions, i.e. dinucleotidic, tetranucleotidic and pentanucleotidic, possibly caused by lethal frame-shift mutations . it has been demonstrated that tri- and hexanucleotides repeats occur more frequently in coding regions than in non-coding regions of many eukaryotic genomes  <cit> .

there is strong evidence that frequencies of different repeat motif of ssrs in coding regions vary depending on the type of the reciprocal encoded amino acid  <cit> . according to our go analysis, in the h. irregulare genome there is an over-representation of ssrs in genes affecting transcription. by combining these findings, it could be argued that dominance of trirepeats, selection against other repeat numbers , presence of ssrs in genes related to transcriptional factors may be indicative of a role played by ssrs in gene regulation, for instance by altering the abundance of nuclear protein binding sites. it has been already reported in yeast that trinucleotides repeats seem to be common in genes encoding for transcriptional factors  <cit> . variation in repeat length caused by extension or contraction of trinucleotides repeats may thus affect homopolymeric aminoacid sequences, leading to modifications of protein flexibility and/or binding affinity  <cit> , as shown by changes in number of ccg repeats in humans  <cit> . the frequency of trinucleotides decreases further away from orfs, and tetranucleotides dominate in regions further than 500 bp from utrs. interestingly, a similar pattern is observed in introns, where tetranucleotides are dominant compared to trinucleotides. this finding is surprising since this dominance in introns is reported only for vertebrates  <cit> . although intergenic regions and introns may be involved in the regulation of gene expression  <cit> , such a pattern may suggest a loss of constraint that might be expected in regions less directly affected by changes in reading frame. other fungal species analyzed at genomic level, including tuber melanosporum and laccaria bicolor, have showed strong constraint against tetranucleotidic ssrs in intronic regions  <cit> .

trinucleotides were dominant in the 5’utrs and significantly less abundant than expected both in 3’utrs and downstream of 3’utrs. dominance of trirepeats in the 5’utr has been generally reported for both animals and plants  <cit> , however, the h. irregulare genome is characterized by a higher frequency of ssrs in the 3’utr, a trait commonly associated with animals and not plants  <cit> . this trait also differentiates h. irregulare from the symbiont mushroom laccaria bicolor, characterized by a notable absence of ssrs in 3’utr regions  <cit> . the overall low number of ssrs in the h. irregulare genome, the clear dominance of trinucleotides in both the 5’utr and within 50 bp upstream 5’utr, and the low representation of dinucleotides within 50 bp upstream 5’utrs suggest a history of negative selection towards those ssrs  that are more likely to disrupt the functions played by these regions. in this scenario, dinucleotides might be harmful or costly and hence promptly purged by h. irregulare.

results of the analysis on specific ssrs motifs were both expected and unexpected. the most abundant triplet found in introns was acg, a motif reported as abundant in several basidiomycetes species  <cit> . unexpectedly, cg was also abundant, despite its reported underrepresentation in most organisms, including several fungi. additionally, the aat motif, reported as common in transcribed regions for many fungal species, was found to be absent in regions of h. irregulare with similar function  <cit> .

intraspecific and interspecific variability of trinucleotide ssrs in different genomic regions
amova results obtained from the analyses of the two h. irregulare populations and of the three h. annosum populations showed consistently a larger variability within populations than among populations, independent of location of the ssr locus. greater variation was detected among genotypes within populations  and between the two species , than among populations of the same species . these results suggest a lack of genetically differentiated populations for both species in italy. as expected, native h. annosum populations showed higher level of polymorphisms than the invasive h. irregulare populations, which have recently undergone the bottleneck of the introduction from north america into italy  <cit> .

although ssrs within orfs  were less polymorphic than ssrs located elsewhere, they differentiated the two species as well as markers immediately upstream of 5’utrs . additionally, both types of markers, in and up, were more powerful in differentiating the two species than loci clearly located away from transcribed regions . variability of ssrs immediately upstream 5’utrs and within orfs may be limited because of their transcriptional and regulatory function, respectively  <cit> . the greater discriminating power of ssrs that are less  or equally  polymorphic than ssrs in other genomic regions corroborates the hypothesis that evolution of ssrs located in these functional genomic regions is not neutral, but may be directional and under the same type of evolution pressure as the locus they are associated with  <cit> . in fact, a variation of repeat units in regions upstream of coding genes, i.e. promoter regions, may affect transcription and/or translation, possibly leading to phenotypic effects  <cit> . this interpretation is also supported by the observation that the pattern of frequency of different types of ssrs is identical in the up regions and within exons, and clearly different from patterns observed in other genomic regions. it has been previously demonstrated that genetic variation supplied by ssrs could be partially responsible for phenotypic differences both at the interspecific level  and at intraspecific level . for instance, polymorphisms in ssr repeats within the promoter region of the yeast ras <dig> locus, a gene assumed to be involved in modulating sporulation efficiency, could be linked to differences in sporulation efficiency in different strains  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this is one of the first reports linking the presence and type of ssrs with dna regions upstream of 5’utr. although definitive experimental confirmation is needed , this study supports the notion that selection processes occur almost exclusively in favour of trinucleotides in the 5’utr in fungi, a well-known mechanism in other groups of organisms. it could be inferred that ssrs in different genomic locations may be evolving following different rates and evolutionary trajectories. from an applied perspective, while ssrs away from transcribed regions may be better to identify different genotypes, ssrs within orfs or immediately upstream 5’utr may be more powerful to study diverging populations or closely related sibling species.
