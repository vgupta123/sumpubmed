BACKGROUND
in models of spinal cord injury , transplantation of growth-permissive tissues and cells has been performed to provide trophic support for damaged neurons and to transform the inhibitory milieu of the lesion site; this allows axons to grow through the otherwise impenetrable glial scar or cystic cavity. olfactory ensheathing glia  facilitate the growth of newly-generated olfactory sensory axons into the olfactory bulb in normal adults  <cit>  and after olfactory nerve section  <cit> . these cells have the potential to facilitate repair after injury, and their potential to enhance tissue repair has been extensively tested in experimental sci models  <cit> . schwann cell  grafts also have the ability to promote axonal regeneration following peripheral and cns injuries  <cit> , and as such were used in this study to compare the outcomes achieved using oeg in sub-acute spinal cord injury model.

standard methods for isolating adult rat and human scs have been developed, which result in a homogenous population of cells with stable characteristics  <cit> . however, methods to both isolate the oeg and transplant the oeg vary considerably, as do the experimental results. oeg display considerable morphological plasticity in vitro, changing phenotype within hours after changes in culture conditions  <cit> . despite this, consistent functional and anatomical improvements have been obtained using olfactory bulb-derived p75-purified oeg from adult inbred rats  <cit> ; results with lamina propria-derived oeg are less consistent  <cit> .

to initially identify transplanted oeg and scs, immunohistochemistry using an antibody to low affinity nerve growth factor receptor  was used. however this approach is problematic, because it cannot unequivocally distinguish between transplanted oeg and scs from endogenous scs, which may enter the spinal cord via dorsal root entry zones or blood vessels  <cit> . detection of p <dig> can sometimes be unreliable, as its ligand-binding domain can be cleaved in vivo and in vitro by endogenous proteases  <cit> . for this reason, lentiviral ex-vivo pre-labeling  <cit>  of oeg and scs with dsred- <dig> was also used in this study. this allowed the quantification of surviving grafted cells, the analysis of their distribution and influence on endogenous spinal cord cells and axons, and assessment of their impact on matrix deposition and the host repair process.

we hypothesized that transplants of adult oeg or scs may differ in their ability to promote axonal sparing/regeneration  <cit>  and that a delayed transplant at 14 days post injury would improve anatomical and functional outcomes following a spinal cord contusion. this experimental study is based on numerous years of research into both glial types in cns injuries, including the spinal cord. this time point was chosen because:  it represents a realistic time window deliver this type of cellular therapy in a clinical trial. this time period also gives consideration for time needed to generate and purify sufficient autologous oegs for transplantation into injured patients, stabilization surgery and an optimal time window for best outcomes  <cit> ,  experimental data from previous animal studies indicate that delayed transplantation may be more beneficial for cell survival, integration and reduced immune mediated rejection  <cit> , and  after 15 days in vivo a significant scar forms that may inhibit cell integration and axonal regeneration  <cit> . in support of this time point, 14 days was the time point chosen for the recent oligodendrocyte precursor and activated macrophage clinical trials. it should also be noted that the term “sparing/regeneration” has been used in relation to the analysis of axonal growth within this manuscript; this is because as described previously in a contusion model study  <cit>  using fluorogold, we cannot truly distinguish between spared and regenerated axons.

RESULTS
cell transplantation is associated with improved retention of tissue at the lesion site
all experimental groups exhibited loss of tissue at the lesion site following the initial contusion injury . morphological analysis involved measuring the total amount of residual tissue; this included intact tissue, as well as the remaining graft and other degenerate/regenerate tissue that could not be classified as white or grey matter. the total tissue remaining included degenerate/regenerate tissue and the cellular trabeculae between cysts, lesion site and grafted cells. tissue integrity classification was determined by nissl gold myelin staining, which allows distinction between intact and non-intact tissue containing macrophages. the extent of the injury/transplant zone was also identified by the use of gfap immunostaining, which allows the area of intact spinal cord versus the cyst areas to be defined. on the day of transplantation , the total spinal cord tissue remaining was  <dig> ± <dig> % of uninjured spinal cord and the amount of remaining intact tissue was  <dig> ± <dig> % .

two weeks following cell scs transplantation , there were no significant differences between groups in the amount of total tissue , with  <dig> ± <dig> % > of normal in the medium-injected group,  <dig> ± <dig> %  in the oeg-transplanted group and  <dig> ± <dig> %  in the scs-transplanted group. similarly, there were no significant differences  between groups for intact tissue remaining, which was  <dig> ± <dig> %  of normal in the medium-injected group,  <dig> ± <dig> %  in the oeg-transplanted group and  <dig> ± <dig> %  in the scs-transplanted group.

it was not until the 4 month time point that total tissue in the transplanted groups was found to be significantly greater than controls . total tissue was  <dig> ± <dig> %  of uninjured spinal cord tissue in the medium-injected group,  <dig> ± <dig> %  in the oeg-transplanted group and  <dig> ± <dig> %  in the scs-transplanted group. a significant difference  was also seen between groups at 4 months in the amount of intact tissue remaining, which was  <dig> ± <dig> %  of normal in the medium-injected group,  <dig> ± <dig> %  in the oeg-transplanted group, and  <dig> ± <dig> % in the scs-transplanted group .

nissl staining/gold chloride staining
spinal cord sections visualized with nissl staining showed good preservation of spinal tissue. cysts that were present were frequently small  and very few in number. as mentioned above, no difference in tissue survival was noted in any of the control or transplanted groups . nissl gold myelin staining at 4 months showed a reduction in tissue loss, particularly the reduction in cyst volume and sparing of white and grey matter within the lesion zone . the presence of round microcysts was noticeable in the spinal cords of scs treated rats, and were present in 2 week and 4 month spinal cords; neither oeg transplanted rats or control  rats showed these cysts.

transgene expression, cell dispersal and survival of transplanted schwann cells and oeg
approximately 92% of oeg and 99% of scs were labeled in vitro  . oeg or scs were not previously transduced with self inactivating lentiviral-dsred- <dig> vectors. this vector was found to be non-toxic  and enabled visualization of cytoplasmic spread and cellular morphology for up to 4 months post-transplantation into the cns. dsred-2’s stability and capacity to track cells was determined to be as efficient as seen previously with gfp  <cit> . dsred- <dig> labeled showed no additional immunological response in vivo when compared to the gfp transgene which may occur with lacz  <cit>  or human placental alkaline phosphatase  <cit> .

figures 2c and d show representative spinal cord sagittal sections with oeg and scs grafts 2 weeks following cell transplantation. lentiviral-dsred- <dig> labeled oeg was detected in all but one of the animals whereas lentiviral-dsred- <dig> labeled scs was detected in all animals. at 2 weeks after transplantation to the injured spinal cord, dsred- <dig> fluorescence pixel intensity for surviving transplanted oeg was 70± <dig> at the rostral aspects of the transplant/lesion zone, versus 91± <dig> for scs, at the center of the lesion 86± <dig> for oeg and 100± <dig> for scs. lastly the dsred- <dig> fluorescence pixel intensity at the caudal edge of the transplant/lesion was 83± <dig> for oeg and 79± <dig> for scs. in rats at 2 weeks  analyzed, detectable transplanted oeg had in some cases dispersed up to 5 mm from the center of the injection site, the furthest distance measured. in contrast, dsred- <dig> positive transplanted scs were highly localized to the site of injection, dispersing no more than  <dig>  mm from the injection site. at 2 weeks post transplantation the surviving oeg were dispersed throughout the lesion site and adjacent spinal cord tissue, and were aligned along the rostro-caudal axis of the spinal cord. scs were densely packed, with an alignment that was highly regular within the graft area but did not disperse into the intact host cns tissue surrounding the lesion site.

four months after oeg transplantation, dsred- <dig> positive oeg were detected in  <dig> out of  <dig> animals  whereas dsred- <dig> positive scs were detected in  <dig> out of  <dig> animals . measurements of dsred- <dig> fluorescence pixel intensity showed oeg at the rostral part of the lesion at 22± <dig> and scs 34± <dig>  at the center of the lesion the values were 21± <dig> for oeg and 29± <dig> for scs. dsred- <dig> pixel fluorescence was found to be 19± <dig> for oeg at the caudal part of the lesion and 28± <dig> for scs. as estimated from the dsred- <dig> fluorescence, the levels of oeg present within the spinal cord had decreased throughout the rostral-caudal axis of the lesion by 74% at 4 months from the value seen at 2 weeks post transplantation. at the same time dsred- <dig> fluorescence pixel values for scs reduced from 2 weeks and 4 months, however fluorescence levels were significantly higher than oeg levels  .

scar formation, cs <dig> synthesis and gliosis
deposition of proteoglycan scar/inhibitory molecules was assessed in transplanted oeg, scs, and control medium injected spinal cords by immunofluorescence section staining with antibodies to gfap and cs <dig> . the extent of staining was assessed across the lesion site in a rostro-caudal direction. after 2 weeks post transplantation, oeg spinal cords showed a moderate change in gfap staining when compared to scs and medium treated spinal cords . in particular, this was noted at the caudal aspect of the transplant zone . at 4 months following oeg, scs and medium injections, gfap immunofluorescence staining  revealed a trend towards a lower degree of gfap immunofluorescence at the injury zone. the oeg transplanted group showed a reduction of 27% in gfap immunofluorescence when compared to the scs transplanted group and a 23% reduction in gfap immunofluorescence when compared to the medium-injected group. however, this difference was not statistically significant .

integration of transplanted cells with host astrocytes was frequent for the oeg transplant groups but infrequent for the scs transplant animals. cs <dig> proteoglycan staining was analyzed across the oeg, scs and medium groups in the 4 month post transplant spinal cords . immunofluorescence staining for cs <dig> in the scs transplanted group  was significantly greater than medium injected control sections   and the cs <dig> immunofluorescence was greater in the scs group compared to the oeg transplanted group  . cs <dig> immunofluorescence in the oeg group was not significantly different from the levels seen in the medium injected controls.

extracellular matrix deposition within the lesion site
at 4 months post injury, the grey and white matter bordering the lesion site contained numerous blood vessels, the walls of which were highlighted by laminin- <dig> staining . the dura mater was strongly immunoreactive for laminin- <dig> in all analyzed spinal cords. in addition to the meningeal and vascular-associated laminin- <dig>  the graft sites of oeg and scs grafts also contained laminin- <dig>  compared to the medium injected control group, the laminin-1-stained area appeared more extensive in both the oeg and scs transplanted groups, but these differences were not statistically significant . at higher magnification, it was observed that areas strongly immunoreactive for laminin- <dig> co-existed with the dsred- <dig> positive cells only in the scs transplanted group . frequently, the areas of strong laminin- <dig> immunoreactivity in oeg grafted spinal cords were not associated with the location of surviving dsred- <dig> positive transplanted cells, indicating another source or cell type such as endothelial cells for the laminin- <dig>  laminin-1-positive structures around bundles of axons in both the oeg and scs transplanted groups were observed.

the profile of immunoreactivity for collagen iv  was similar to that observed for laminin- <dig>  structures resembling blood vessels were visible around the site of the spinal cord lesion in the oeg transplanted group . while the graft site of the oeg transplanted group contained more collagen iv immunofluorescence than that of the other groups , measurement using pixel intensity revealed the collagen iv immunofluorescence for each group to be statistically similar . as with laminin- <dig>  at higher magnification, collagen iv could be seen in high quantities in regions of the scs grafts. however in the oeg transplanted group high amounts of collagen iv appeared to originate from dsred- <dig> negative cells in the vicinity of the dsred- <dig> positive cells , which may represent either endogenous scs invading from the periphery or host endothelial cells.

axonal profiles inside lesion site
immunohistochemistry with the neurofilament-specific antibody rt- <dig> was used to estimate the presence of medium and high neurofilament-containing axons in and around the lesion site of all transplanted groups and controls . at the lesion epicenter of all groups, continuous white matter tracts of spared axons could be seen at the ventral edges of each section . dorsal white matter tracts were in an improved state of preservation after oeg and scs transplants. in addition, rt97+ axons were present in the lesion site in all transplanted and control groups with rt97+ axons being co-extensive with dsred- <dig> oeg and scs . axons entering scs graft areas or putative graft areas, were commonly observed to lose rostral-caudal directionality and instead aligned with the random internal organization of the graft . however this non-linear pathway for axons was not seen in the oeg transplanted spinal cords .

evidence for infiltration of endogenous schwann cells into the spinal cord
in several of the oeg or scs transplanted animals, the lesion site contained numerous fascicles of cells with glial-like spindle-shaped morphology; these cells were positive for p <dig> but negative for dsred- <dig>  sections from the medium-injected group also contained p75-positive cells both at 2 weeks and 4 months after transplant day . the p75-positive cells in the oeg  and scs  transplant groups may have been donor cells that were not expressing the dsred- <dig> transgene. it is also possible that scs had migrated into the spinal cord from blood vessels within the spinal cord or via the dorsal roots  <cit> . the latter is more likely, because the method using lentiviral vectors encoding transgene such as gfp have previously been shown to display long term expression  <cit>  and these p75-positive cells were also detected in the medium-injected groups.

numbers of retrogradely labeled descending axons increased by glial transplantation
retrograde labeling with fluorogold was used to quantify extension of spared/regenerated descending supraspinal axons reaching 8 mm beyond the most caudal edge of the contusion site. mean±standard errors of numbers of descending fluorogold-labeled cells are presented. there were statistically significant differences  between the total brain counts of the oeg transplanted group  and also the scs transplanted group  when compared to the control injury only group .

statistical differences  were seen in a number of separate brain regions projecting distally through the injury zone. oeg transplanted rats showed statistically significant differences in the raphe projecting neurons  compared to controls . numbers of fluorogold neurons in the raphe for scs transplanted rats  did not show significant differences when compared to control injuries only. rubrospinal fluorogold numbers in the oeg and scs grafted groups were similar  and not statistically significantly different from the control injury only group . the numbers of fluorogold labeled neurons in the hypothalamus were significantly higher in both the oeg and scs groups  when compared to controls . fluorogold labeled neurons in the reticular formation in control injury only rats numbered 632± <dig>  as compared to 1590± <dig> for oeg treated rats and 1635± <dig> for scs grafted animals . fluorogold numbers in the trigeminal/dc were not statistically significantly different in all groups . this was also the case for corticospinal layer v neurons whose axons rarely seen to project into the distal spinal cord  fluorogold injection site . finally, neurons labeled in the vestibular system were significantly increased in the oeg and scs transplanted rats  when compared to control injury only rats .

*the contusion only groups received a moderate contusion injury. fourteen days after injury, oeg or schwann cells were transplanted into the lesion site; controls received an injection of cell culture medium. data are presented as means ± sem.

#significantly different from the contusion only group, as determined by anova plus dunnett’s t test; p< <dig> .

schwann and oeg cell grafts increase the number of spared/regenerated propriospinal neurons
fluorogold propriospinal neurons were counted from spinal cord segments rostral to the lesion/transplantation site . propriospinal neurons that had reached the caudal injected fluorogold  numbered 6± <dig> in the medium injected group 38± <dig> in the oeg transplanted group and 131± <dig> in the scs transplanted group . as seen in figure  <dig> there was a significant difference between the medium injected and oeg transplanted groups, but a significantly larger number of labeled propriospinal neurons was observed in the scs group as compared to the medium injected group . there was no statistically significant difference between the oeg and scs transplanted groups.

functional recovery: open field behavioral testing  and ladder walk testing
at two weeks after injury and again at two weeks after transplantation, rats in all groups had regained bladder function. open field behavioral scoring indicated no statistically significant changes in the bbb scores in all groups before transplantation . one week following transplantation of oeg or scs  these scores did not increase above control scores, with all groups scoring 10– <dig>  at 2 weeks after treatment with cells or medium, control injury only rats scored a mean of  <dig>  medium injected scored  <dig>  oeg scored  <dig> and scs scored  <dig> . three weeks following injection of cells, the mean bbb scores for oeg injected rats were  <dig>  scs scored  <dig>  medium injected scored  <dig> and injury only scored  <dig>  theses scores were consistent for all the following time points until day  <dig> and  <dig> when oeg scored a mean of  <dig>  scs scored  <dig>  medium injected scored  <dig> and  <dig>  and injury only scored  <dig> and  <dig> respectively .

after one week of testing on the bbb score the rats were introduced to the ladder walk . at 6 weeks or 4 months after treatment, most rats scored between  <dig>  and  <dig>   out of  <dig> on the horizontal ladder walking test , with no significant differences observed between groups.

discussion
we have shown the capacity of purified, primary oeg and scs to promote behavioral recovery, increase numbers of supraspinal axons, and increase tissue sparing when transplanted two weeks after a moderate spinal cord contusion injury. a lentiviral vector encoding dsred- <dig> was used to transduce oeg and scs – in this study it was shown to be an effective and stable transgene to label both cell types up to 4 months in vivo following transplantation. viable transplanted oeg and scs were found in similar numbers at 2 weeks, but after 4 months the oeg numbers were less than the number of scs remaining. histochemical tissue analysis showed a significant reduction in tissue loss in both the oeg and scs groups 4 months post-transplantation. further, dorsal white matter tracts appeared to be better protected in the transplant groups than in non-cellular transplanted controls . analysis of dsred- <dig> labeled glia in the spinal cords showed a migration/dispersal difference between the two cell types. oeg were more evenly distributed in a rostro-caudal direction, and greater integration of oeg with host astrocytes was evident when compared to the tight interwoven grafts in the scs transplanted rats. oeg transplanted rats displayed significantly lower levels of cs <dig> immunofluorescence within and around the lesion/transplant site when compared to the scs group. matrix deposition was similar between oeg and scs groups, but laminin and collagen iv immunofluorescence showed a closer co-existence of these matrix molecules to scs than to oeg. axonal staining using neurofilament antibodies showed tighter bundles of axons within the scs transplant zone than in oeg zones. open field behavioral testing  showed significant differences between the transplanted groups and the controls up to 4 months after transplantation. bbb scores were consistently higher in the oeg group compared to control injury, medium and scs injected rats. additional behavioral testing using the ladder walk however, did not show any significant differences between experimental and control groups. fluorogold retrograde tracing 8 mm distal to the injury/transplantation site revealed significant differences between control groups and oeg and scs transplanted groups in supraspinal projecting axon populations. this provides strong evidence that a sub-acute transplant of scs or oeg provide an environment in which promotion of sparing/regeneration of supraspinal axonal projections to the spinal cord are increased.

scs and oeg differ in their interaction with host spinal cord cells and matrix production
evidence of statistically significant tissue-protective effects of oeg was observed 4 months after transplantation. at 2 weeks post-transplantation, tissue loss was still occurring. the tissue-protective effects of transplanted oeg or scs arise from the secretion of factors from the cells such as bdnf, ngf, gdnf and nt4/ <dig>  <cit>  or matrix  and adhesion molecule  secretion  <cit> . these mechanisms of protection combined with tissue-rebuilding or new cell birth  <cit> , are potentially acting together to improve anatomical functional outcomes.

proliferation of donor oeg seems unlikely, as the labeling method employed in this study would result in all daughter cells also being labeled; the number of labeled cells at 4 months in the lesion site were fewer than when counted at 2 weeks. the fewer numbers of detectable oeg involves movement away from the site of injury , or death   <cit> . in a small number of animals, oeg were observed several millimeters from the injection site which is similar to earlier studies which reported oeg migration at distances of 9 mm from the injection site  <cit> . in contrast to the oeg, scs were not observed very far from the immediate lesion area, dispersing only up to a distance of  <dig>  mm. a similar lack of dispersal has been reported out of peripheral nerve grafts inserted into the adult cns  <cit> . this is likely due to interactions with host astrocytes and other endogenous non-neuronal cells  <cit> .

the observed difference in the amount of intact tissue between the oeg and scs transplanted groups indicates chemotropic effects of the oeg  <cit> , similar to the chemotropic effects exerted by glia during development  <cit>  that result in increased infiltration of various cells into the lesion site. oeg have the capacity to stimulate a different inflammatory response by the secretion of chemokines such as cx3cl <dig>  <cit> , which is a known ligand for the receptor cx3cr <dig> found on microglia and dendritic cells  <cit>  and affects the amount of tissue preservation/removal. oeg potentially are be more susceptible to death and subsequent phagocytosis by macrophages than scs. oeg are known to secrete different factors and have unique antigenic profiles other than the ones mentioned above which make them more susceptible to immune attack  <cit> .

oeg and scs transplants have the properties to directly influence proliferation or differentiation of spinal cord progenitor cells/stem cells  <cit> . glial transplants have the potential to differentiate these stem cells, like fibroblasts  <cit> , into neurons or myelinating glia  <cit> . in our study we did not examine the direct oeg or scs myelination potential or host myelination within the lesion site. both cell types have the capacity to myelinate but differ in their effectiveness and mechanisms involved . the proliferation of endogenous cells does occur in sci  <cit> . these cells can include progenitor cells, endothelial and pericytes stimulated by factors such as epidermal growth factor and/or fibroblast growth factor- <dig>  <cit> . proliferation seems highly plausible especially when oeg and scs are known to produce similar levels of fgf- <dig>  <cit> . two recent findings have indicated new cells play a role in sci. new evidence from goritz and colleagues  <cit>  has indicated that pericytes play a role in the spinal cord injury response, whereby these cells actively migrate to sites of injury. oeg and scs in our model are likely to have altered the number of these cells in the lesion site, thus providing a reparative outcome. in addition, evidence by decimo and colleagues  <cit>  found new adult stem cell /precursor cells that are resident in the meninges react to sci and populate the injury site, thus providing a target for glial cell differentiation or activation.

in this study we provide evidence that following spinal cord contusion injury, endogenous repair processes including scs migration were ongoing. proliferation of ependymal cells in the walls of the central canal and from adjacent intact parts of spinal cord  <cit>  is one route. ependymal cells are known to migrate and populate the lesion site along with new blood vessels, astrocytes and fibroblasts. this seems likely to have contributed to the cellular trabeculae and scar tissue seen within our lesion cysts  <cit> . host scs from the dorsal roots or blood vessels also infiltrated the lesion site in our model, based on large numbers of p75-positive/dsred- <dig> negative cells in all groups, as has previously been observed in the rat  <cit>  and human  <cit>  with the majority from the dorsal roots  <cit> .

in a previous study from our laboratory  <cit> , we indicated that molecules  released by schwann cells promote the reactivity of astrocytes. transplanted scs stimulate astrocytes to be highly gfap positive and surrounded by cs <dig> staining. this forms a dense glial scar around the lesion and prevents the entry of axons, and/or other host non-neuronal cells  <cit> . in this study we demonstrate in sub-acute  <dig> day glial transplants, oeg were associated with significantly lower cs <dig> expression and slightly higher collagen iv expression in the lesion and graft site compared to scs. since oeg are proficient in interacting with astrocytes in vitro <cit> , their release of extracellular matrix and cell adhesion molecules and their modulation of these factors may also account for the observed axonal infiltration into the glial scar  <cit> . molecules such as fibulin- <dig> and its ability to bind timp- <dig> may also play a part in the different interaction with host glia  <cit> . oeg isolated from the olfactory bulb show high levels of this protein when compared to scs  <cit> . one recent report has also suggested an important role of mmp’s in cell migration and modulation of the ecm  <cit> . while both oeg and scs appeared to be associated with a greater quantity of extracellular matrix molecules in the lesion site compared to the effect of medium injection alone, their profiles differed. the laminin was present in a complementary and non-overlapping pattern to dsred- <dig> labeled scs and oeg. scs appeared to produce basement membrane, while oeg are capable of producing these molecules but not in the quantity seen in scs grafted animals; rather, they may have induced other cells to produce extracellular matrix such as astrocytes or endothelial cells. this is not surprising given the role the oeg play in the olfactory system, where oeg form channels which stay present even after axonal degeneration in the olfactory bulb for axons to grow through and out to innervate areas of the olfactory bulb  <cit> . one mechanism for oeg reparative outcomes in the cns is their close “cross-talking” with fibroblasts/meningeal cells [see  <cit>  and ability to interact with these cells  <cit> . oegs have a very close relationship with fibroblasts in the olfactory system, as do scs in the peripheral nerve, but their role seems very different. scs are potentiated to myelinate axons by fibroblasts and their associated matrix  <cit> , whereas oeg interact in an axonal replacement/regenerating system without myelination  <cit> . in addition they have previously been shown play a role in fascicle-forming arrangements without fibroblasts  <cit> .

olfactory glia and schwann cells increase axonal sparing/regeneration in sub acute treated sci
our results show that transplantation of oeg or scs at 2 weeks after contusion facilitated significant axonal sparing/regeneration comparable to those seen in transplants carried out 7 days after a contusion injury  <cit> . significant increases in regenerated propriospinal fibers were also present in both graft groups, but numbers in scs treated animals were significantly higher than after oeg transplantation. this indicates a more potent, local secretion of factors by scs compared to oeg, but as yet no study has extensively analyzed these differences. in this study, an oeg or scs transplantation following a contusion injury was associated with an increased amount of intact tissue at the lesion site. immunohistochemistry for neurofilament-positive axons showed strongly immunoreactive profiles at the lesion site for both oeg and scs transplanted groups after a 14 day delay of transplantation. neurofilament positive axons in the scs group were less linearly organized than those seen in the oeg group. this could be explained by the interaction with host astrocytes not allowing for the even distribution of the cells and the formation of a clear cellular boundary  <cit> .

retrograde tracing using fluorogold revealed statistically significant increased numbers for supraspinal tracts after oeg or scs transplantation. supraspinal spinal tracts such as reticular, vestibular and hypothalamic were seen to respond similarly in both transplant groups. it should be noted that these supraspinal fibers were measured from 8 mm distal to the injury site, and so possible differences in fiber numbers between the transplanted cell groups at the lesion site itself cannot be discounted. unlike the other spinal tracts, the raphe tract responded in a far more robust fashion in the oeg group. this can be via increased responsiveness to bdnf from the oeg directly or by the interaction with activated microglia which are known to secrete bdnf after atp activation through the p2x <dig> receptor  <cit> . oeg differ to scs in their levels of fractalkine secretion, and this can activate microglia to become more active and secrete different neurotrophic profiles to that initiated by scs that do not secrete this protein at the same level. an important consideration, that is difficult to assess at the time of cell delivery, is the stage of cellular differentiation of transplanted glia after a period of time in vivo. scs will differentiate into myelin forming cells quite quickly thus reducing their regenerative/autocrine secretory products  <cit>  whereas oeg stay in an undifferentiated [p75-positive) non-myelin forming state for a longer periods  or may not myelinate at all  <cit> .

functional recovery is improved after sub acute transplantation of oeg and scs
significant behavioral differences were observed between the control injury and medium injected rats, and both oeg and scs grafted groups. improvements, which are normally observed in studies similar to that undertaken here, may result from compensatory effects occurring within reflex-based segmental cord systems  <cit> . oeg transplantation into a completely transected spinal cord has elicited improved hindlimb function  <cit>  as seen here. one possibility that could increase locomotion is increased noradrenergic and serotonergic varicosities apposing the motor associated cholinergic neurons  <cit> . oeg treated rats showed significant numbers of raphe projecting axons reaching at least 8 mm distal from the injury site and these could stimulate such a behavioral response. this however does not explain the scs grafted rats which may use an alternate but effective pathway of locomotion. scs induced recovery could be partially explained by a graft relay system developed through regeneration of propriospinal axons regeneration as seen in our results here. only small numbers of spared fibers  are required to facilitate compensatory return of function via segmental circuits  <cit> . phasic behavioral recovery in the scs group, in particular 49 days until the end of the experiment, may be due to phasic secretion of neurotrophins which may not be delivered at the same level via the transplantation of oeg.

CONCLUSIONS
glial cells transplanted at 14 days post injury may experience a less accommodating lesion site than when grafted 1 week after injury, which may explain a reduced glial survival in particular for oeg than seen in earlier transplant studies. at 14 days post sci proteoglycan deposition at the lesion site is present and highly inhibitory  <cit>  but was shown to be reduced in the oeg transplanted groups providing a positive milieu for the sparing/regeneration of supraspinal axons . this evidence is strongly backed by our use of fluorogold tracing, but was not supported by immunohistochemistry for 5-ht  <cit>  . supplementation of glial transplants with neurotrophins may improve cell survivability  <cit>  and in combination with removal of the glial scar by the use of chondroitinase could potentially improve axonal regeneration in this 14 day delayed glial transplant model  <cit> . clearly the delay between injury and treatment can have a strong bearing on the experimental outcome but also the success of the glial type to improve tissue and behavioral outcomes, modify the lesion site and improve sparing/regeneration of axonal populations as shown here. from the present study it would appear that a 14 day delay in glial transplantation is feasible and beneficial both anatomically and behaviorally after a contusive spinal cord injury but the mechanisms of repair of the two glial types are different. we have examined two time points  using multiple behavioral and anatomical analysis, but results can only give an indication of efficacy. further physiological, behavioral and anatomical correlative studies using these glial cells at 14 days post injury time point would provide valuable evidence of cell potential and reproducibility for future cns repair applications.
