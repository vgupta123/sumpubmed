BACKGROUND
widespread use of high-throughput sequencers has allowed an ever increasing number of species to have a whole genome sequence  prepared. while many of these have been model or domestic organisms, a wide array of taxa continue to be sequenced . wgs opens the door for a multitude of subsequent analyses including: 1) creation of phylogenies and assessment of broader evolutionary patterns and innovations  <cit> . 2) annotation of genes  <cit>  and identification of rearrangements or gene expansions  <cit> . 3) discovery of large sets of markers  <cit> . 4) resequencing studies, including those that are genome-wide yet not full coverage  but benefit from the presence of a reference genome  <cit> . resequencing at any scale also allows for ‘population genomics’ including investigations of local adaptation or population differentiation  <cit> , demographic history  <cit> , and the genetic basis of phenotypic traits  <cit> .

in the absence of a reference, construction of a wgs necessitates de novo methodologies  <cit> . these methods require large volumes of raw sequence data which are arranged into contigs and then joined to scaffolds by either computational methods  <cit> , anchoring with outside information , or continued sequencing  <cit> . such an endeavor is still relatively expensive and challenging in terms of the bioinformatics involved, making it beyond the capability of many research programs. however, the presence of a reference sequence enables reads to be aligned to the reference which is much faster and allows for lower sequence depths than de novo assembly  <cit> . recent work has highlighted that the reference need not come from the same species the reads are from  opening these methods to a wide array of ‘genome-enabled’ taxa  <cit> .

there are a number of reasons why we are motivated to produce a bighorn sheep  wgs. first, this species has a complex demographic history in north america that has been profoundly influenced by anthropogenic activity, having experienced intense hunting, local extirpations and disease-related die-offs, as well as translocations and reintroductions throughout its range . these events are expected to have significant genetic/genomic consequences  <cit>  that merit further study. second, there are several long-term study populations in which individual based questions such as the genetic basis of complex traits  <cit>  and linkages between individual genetic variation and differences in fitness  <cit>  can be addressed using genomic data. finally, bighorn sheep are an excellent candidate for cross-species approaches since genomic resources for domestic sheep  can be easily applied to bighorn sheep as they are a close relative  and are expected to share a high degree of genomic synteny  <cit> . genomic resources have been recently developed for bighorn sheep , but future resequencing efforts would be aided by species specific genomic sequence data.

here we use cross-species alignment to create a draft genome from a single ram sequenced using abi solid technology. the pros and cons of different high-throughput sequencers have been discussed at length elsewhere . choice of a specific platform balances read length, the amount of sequence data output, error profiles, and cost. solid technology is well-suited for resequencing studies as it returns high volumes of data and the sequence-by-ligation strategy is able to distinguish sequencing errors from true nucleotide variants during alignment  <cit> . based on our alignment we called variants, annotated snps relative to domestic sheep, and conducted enrichment analysis of those snps showing fixed differences.

RESULTS
solid sequencing and alignment
whole-genome sequencing of a single bighorn sheep ram was performed using two libraries and abi solid platforms. prior to trimming the  <dig> × 50 bp mate-paired library contained  <dig> , <dig> reads, while the 75 bp fragment library contained  <dig> , <dig> reads. filtering and alignment were then conducted on both libraries in clc genomics workbench . post-trimming, read count was  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  for the mate-paired and fragment libraries respectively.

the resulting reads from each library were then independently aligned to domestic sheep chromosomes version  <dig>   <cit> . when aligned on its own the mate-paired library had  <dig> , <dig> reads map to the reference, of which  <dig> , <dig> were in pairs with an average distance of  <dig> nucleotides between pairs, while the fragment library had  <dig> , <dig> reads map to the reference. once merged, the two libraries covered 95% of the reference genome with an average read depth of  <dig> .

variant calling
in total,  <dig> , <dig> variants  passed our filtering thresholds  and were called compared to the domestic sheep reference using samtools version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . of the putatively bi-allelic snps relative to the domestic sheep reference,  <dig> , <dig> were transitions and  <dig> , <dig> were transversions . insertions were slightly more common than deletions . to assess snp calling accuracy, genotypes from the aligned genome were compared to those generated for the same individual on the ovine infinium®hd snp beadchip  <cit> . of the  <dig>  loci present on the array  <dig>  loci were successfully genotyped in our bighorn sheep sample. note that a decrease in amplification success is expected from cross-species application of snp chips  <cit> .  <dig>   of these chip loci were present in the list of variants identified by sequencing, and over 93% of the loci showed agreement . to assess the effects of filtering on these results an additional set of filtering criteria was applied to the sequence-derived snps. increasing our stringency thresholds for snps in the wgs decreased the number chip loci that were present in the list of snps identified by sequencing , but increased concordance to ~95%. in both cases the major source of discordance was loci called heterozygous in the wgs but homozygous from the chip data .table  <dig> number of loci showing concordance or discordance between the genome and the ovine infinium®hd snp beadchip



annotation and enrichment analysis
snpeff  <cit>  assigned  <dig> , <dig> functional classes to our snps based on annotation of the domestic sheep genome. note that the number of classes assigned is larger than the number of loci due to the fact that the categories are not mutually exclusive. the vast majority of the snps were predicted to be intronic or intergenic and  <dig>  were assigned to coding regions or have predicted functional effects . of those  <dig>  loci,  <dig>  snps were found to have fixed differences between our bighorn sheep and the domestic sheep reference, from which  <dig>  were identified as non-synonymous and  <dig>  were identified as synonymous. note that sum of the number of synonymous and non-synonymous snps is larger than the total number of fixed differences because a locus may be classified as both synonymous and non-synonymous if a gene has more than one annotated transcript. gene ontology  terms were available for  <dig>  of the snps with fixed differences  representing  <dig>  genes . we looked for functional enrichment between non-synonymous and synonymous snps using blast2go  <cit> . when reduced to the most specific go terms, we found  <dig> biological process go terms to be over represented and  <dig> to be underrepresented in the non-synonymous set compared to the synonymous set . note that gene length was positively correlated to the number of annotated loci for both the non-synonymous and synonymous sets . but given that this association was constant between both non-synonymous and synonymous gene sets we do not think it biases our results. however, one gene, titin, was ~ <dig> times larger than all other genes considered so we repeated the go enrichment analysis dropping titin, which reduced the level of correlation . when titin is removed from the datasets the number of overrepresented and underrepresented terms decrease to  <dig> and  <dig> respectively; all of which were common to the set including titin, except for one underrepresented term  that was unique to the second analysis .fig.  <dig> distribution of snp annotations and effect predictions



discussion
here we present a draft bighorn sheep wgs created by cross-species alignment to a domestic sheep reference sequence. other studies have attempted de novo assembly with solid sequencing data , but this was not an option in our case due to the high read depth required by such methods for a mammalian sized genome. our work more closely resembles that of canavez et al. and  <cit>  wang et al.  <cit> . canavez et al. created a draft genome for an indicine bull  through alignment of solid reads to a taurine cow  reference genome   <cit> . while wang et al. used solid sequencing in a reference guided assembly of a black grouse  draft genome. however, wang et al.  <cit>  used a combination of de novo and alignment methods as the large divergence time between black grouse and domestic chicken  used as a reference  may hinder sequences from aligning properly. in contrast, bighorn and domestic are much less divergent which allows for successful direct alignment of reads: over 76% of our quality filtered reads mapped to the reference genome. once merged, our two sequencing libraries provided 95% coverage of the reference and average 12x  sequence depth.

our alignment produced a large database of snp markers for future studies. approximately 6% of genotypes from a high-density snp chip were discordant with those from the genome alignment, and increasing the quality thresholds for loci discovered in the genome only marginally decreased mismatches to ~4%. in both cases the major source of discordance was loci called heterozygous in the genome alignment but homozygous from the snp chip. this source of discordance could be caused by incorrect joining of paralogous regions due to our procedure of randomly mapping ambiguous alignments. however, given the overall high concordance between the genome aligned snps and those on the snp chip we are confident that the majority of our genotypes represent real snps. these markers add to the set of snps already available for this species  <cit> .

genome scans of domestic sheep breeds have shown a number of regions that have been differentiated due to domestication  <cit> . therefore, we expect alleles associated with production traits to have been swept to or near fixation relative to a wild ancestor as well. our go term analysis of fixed snp differences compared to the domestic sheep reference highlighted  <dig> biological process go terms with significantly different representation in snps tagged as non-synonymous versus synonymous. two of the gene ontologies that were associated with amino-acid changes relative to the domestic sheep reference involved reproduction: spermatogenesis , and negative regulation of mammary gland epithelial cell proliferation . this mirrors recent work has highlighted the genetic effects domestication had on reproductive traits of several sheep breeds  <cit> . another term that was over-represented in the non-synonymous gene set was ossification involved in bone maturation . this term is noteworthy given the relationship of bones to horns which are bony projections covered by a keratinous sheath  <cit> . horns are a major determinant of reproductive success in bighorn sheep, where larger males with bigger horns win antagonistic encounters and gain access to females  <cit> ; however, in many breeds of domestic sheep horns have been selected against leading to gene-level consequences  <cit> . all but two of the overrepresented biological process terms  and maintenance of fidelity involved in dna-dependent dna replication ) remained significant when titin  was removed from the analysis.

for genes less likely to have amino acid changes,  <dig> of the  <dig> go terms were related to muscles or muscle fibers, particularly cardiac muscles, e.g.: cardiac muscle hypertrophy , cardiac myofibril assembly , cardiac muscle fiber development , adult heart development , regulation of relaxation of cardiac muscle , sarcomerogenesis . it is interesting to note these differences associated with muscle properties, given that the domestic sheep reference genome was built from a meat-producing breed, the texel  <cit> . as mentioned above, body size is an important life history characteristic for male bighorn sheep as it relates to access to females, while larger females have been found to have longer lifespans  <cit> . selective breeding for meat production in domestic sheep could favor conservation of the genes or developmental pathways that produce large muscles in bighorn sheep. however, analysis with revigo  <cit>  indicated that there was overlap in these go terms with  <dig> terms falling into two more representative terms: cardiac muscle hypertrophy  and cardiac muscle tissue morphogenesis . in addition, nine of these terms become non-significant when titin  is removed from the datasets.

two factors are important to keep in mind when interpreting the results of our go analysis. the first is that though it is tempting attribute the majority of differences we observed here to domestication and selective breeding, there are likely to be additional factors at play. in particular, natural selection as bighorn sheep and the progenitor to domestic sheep diverged, as well as genetic drift. second, we are only comparing snp sites from one individual’s genome to a reference sequence. this likely results in missing polymorphisms within either species, leading to incorrect annotation of fixed differences. however, we present the results only as a preliminary analysis to highlight candidate ontologies that may contribute to differentiation between the species. such results will need to be confirmed by additional sequencing, alternate analyses , and perhaps functional characterization  <cit> .

while our draft genome represents a step forward in the genomic resources available for bighorn sheep this single genome is representative of a specific demographic history, an example of the ‘n =  <dig> constraint’  <cit> . future population genomic studies using additional individuals from ram mountain or other populations can confirm the variants we describe here, discover additional variants, and more fully examine the demographic history of bighorn sheep  <cit> . expanded sequencing efforts would also allow for comparative genomics to further identify ancestral states and regions of selection relative to domestic sheep. in addition, our bighorn sheep genome can aid reference guided genome assembly  of other ovis species using a genome that has not been subject to strong selective breeding.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we created a wgs for bighorn sheep using the closely related domestic sheep as a reference for alignment. this procedure was highly successful, covering 95% of the reference with an average read depth of  <dig> . from this sequence we were able to call  <dig> , <dig> variants and found  <dig> go terms with significantly different representation in fixed snps tagged as non-synonymous versus synonymous. we hypothesize that these differences may largely be a result of selection during domestication. our results demonstrate that cross-species alignment enables the creation of novel wgs for non-model organisms. the bighorn sheep wgs will provide a resource for future resequencing studies or comparative genomics both for other populations of bighorn sheep or species within the ovis genus.
