BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small non-coding rnas  <cit>  with an approximate length of  <dig> nucleotides originating from long self-complementary precursors  <cit> . mirna precursor sequences  have intrinsic hairpin structure which consists of the entire mirna sequence on one arm of the hairpin and the mirna* sequence on the opposite arm. mirnas regulate a variety of biological processes like development, metabolism, stress response, pathogen defense and maintenance of genome integrity  <cit> . mature mirna gets incorporated into the rna-induced silencing complex   <cit> , which regulates gene expression either by inhibiting translation or by degrading coding mrnas by perfect or near-perfect complement with the target mrnas  <cit> . for a given mirna, the number of target mrna ranges from one to hundreds  <cit> . however, in plants, most of the target mrnas contain a single mirna-complementary site, and the corresponding mirnas perfectly complement these sites and cleave the target mrnas  <cit> .

the first mirna  was identified in caenorhabditis elegans in  <dig>  <cit> . since then, hundreds of mirnas have been identified in plants, animals and viruses. in recent years, advancement in technologies such as bioinformatics and next-generation sequencing  facilitated the identification of huge number of putative mirnas in different organisms. however, the process of identifying mirnas is still a complex and difficult task requiring interdisciplinary strategies, including experimental approaches as well as computational methods. compared to the experimental approaches, computational predictions have been proved to be fast, affordable, and accurate . in the last ten years, different computational strategies have been developed to find new mirnas, including mining the repository of available expressed sequence tags  with known mirnas, as well as those based on the conserved nature of mirnas .

majority of mirnas are evolutionarily conserved between different species of the same kingdom and may also exist as orthologs or homologs in other species  <cit> . computational prediction of putative mirnas is often based on their evolutionarily conserved nature. accordingly, homologs of known mirnas are searched in the est databases to identify the putative pre-mirs in other species. pre-mirs have a specific range of percentage au content in their sequences as well as minimal folding free energy index   <cit> . studies have also shown that pre-mirs have distinct rna folding measures such as normalised shannon entropy , normalized base-pair distance  and normalized base-pairing propensity . thus, au content and mfei are also used as parameters for prediction of new mirnas.

simple sequence repeats  are repeating sequences of one to six nucleotides long  <cit> . the presence of ssrs in pre-mirs was identified by several studies , although their precise role in pre-mirs is yet to be elucidated. the ssrs present in pre-mirs in different species did not show noticeable locational preferences and are found anywhere in pre-mirs, suggesting that ssrs are the important component of pre-mirs  <cit> . in pre-mirs, mononucleotide repeats are the most abundant repeats, followed by di- and tri-nucleotide repeats, while tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide repeats rarely occur  <cit> . moreover, the number of repeats correlates inversely to the length of the repeats  <cit> . absence of long ssrs and low number of repeat types in pre-mirnas may be attributed to their small size, stability and low mutation rate  <cit> . due to these very characteristics, the identification of ssr signatures in pre-mirs is easy and can be used as a parameter in predicting mirnas. however, ssr signatures have not been used in the computational prediction of new mirnas. in the present study, we have used ssr signatures as a parameter to predict new mirnas.

phaseolus vulgaris, belonging to the fabaceae family, is a vital leguminous crop in tropical and subtropical areas of asia, africa, and latin america, as well as parts of southern europe and the usa . p. vulgaris is an important food worldwide and a significant source of fibre, proteins and vitamins . high protein and carbohydrate content makes it not only important for the human diet, but also suitable as high protein feed and fodder for livestock. p. vulgaris is a particular valuable component of low-input farming system of resource-poor farmers . this leguminous crop enhances soil fertility through nitrogen fixation  <cit> . in spite of immense importance, limited information is available about the mirnas of p. vulgaris and their patterns of expression . there are only eight reported mirnas of p. vulgaris in the mirbase  <dig>  <cit> . in the present study, we have identified new mirnas in p. vulgaris by computational methods. in addition to the conventional approaches, we have used the conserved ssr signatures as one of the parameters for prediction. moreover, for all the other parameters, instead of considering a fixed cut-off value, we have used a 99 % probability range derived from the available data. we obtained  <dig> new mirnas, of which  <dig> are novel. few randomly selected predicted mirnas were validated using qrt-pcr. targets for many of the predicted mirnas were identified. additionally, we also validated our computational method by predicting known mirnas in a. thaliana and g. max. our findings will contribute to the present knowledge of mirnas and their targets in p. vulgaris. the computational method developed in this study is not only restricted to p. vulgaris but can be applied to any species of viridiplantae.

RESULTS
analysis of known viridiplantae pre-mirs
all the known  <dig> pre-mirs of viridiplantae in the mirbase  <dig>  <cit>  were analysed, and the probability distributions of their au content, length and mfei are shown in fig.  <dig>  the length of pre-mirs varies from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides, with the mean value of  <dig>  however, when we consider the 99 % probability range, the length of pre-mirs varies from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides. consequently, we set this range as a cut-off value for the prediction of new mirnas. the percentage of au content in the pre-mirs ranges from 17 % to 92 %. this range becomes 27 % to 77 % when we consider the 99 % probability region, and accordingly it is used as the au content cut-off range. the mfei has a mean value of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , however while considering 99 % probability range, it is greater than or equal to  <dig> . consequently, this value is used as the cut-off for mfei. the probability distributions for nd, nq and npb are plotted in fig.  <dig>  considering the 99 % probability region in the distribution, the values of nq and nd are less than or equal to  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, while for npb it is greater than or equal to  <dig> . these values have been used as the cut-off for these parameters.fig.  <dig> probability distributions of percentage au content, length and mfei of pre-mirs belonging to viridiplantae

simple sequence repeats 
to find the conserved ssr signatures within the pre-mirs, all the  <dig> mirna families of viridiplantae were analysed . none of the ssr signatures were found to be conserved in all the families. however, conserved ssr signature was found when a particular family was considered. we find  <dig> families with only one pre-mir, and  <dig> families with two or more pre-mirs. within these  <dig> families, only those conserved ssrs that are present in all the members of a particular family were considered. the conserved ssr having the maximum average r  value was chosen as a ssr signature for a given family. we find that with the window size three, the average r of a signature ssr is greater than  <dig> . with the increase in the window size, the number of mirna families having a conserved ssr signature with an average r greater than two becomes limited. accordingly, the window size three was set to identify the conserved ssr signatures in pre-mirs. for the  <dig> families with only one pre-mir, the ssr with the maximum r was selected as a signature. in single member families, the r is always greater than  <dig> , which is the minimum average r for the ssr signatures found in the multimember families.

the ssr signatures in different mirna families of the kingdom viridiplantae, the family fabaceae and the species p. vulgaris were analysed in table  <dig>  it shows that in viridiplantae,  <dig>  % of mirna families contain the signature auu,  <dig>  % of mirna families contain the signature aau and  <dig>  % of mirna families contain the signature uuu. in fabaceae,  <dig>  % of mirna families contain the signature auu,  <dig>  % of mirna families contain the signature aau and  <dig>  % of mirna families contain the signature uuu. in p. vulgaris, the signature uug is present in  <dig>  % of mirna families, while both the signatures auu and uuu are present in  <dig>  % of mirna families. significantly, the three most frequently found signatures in each taxonomic category are found in most of the mirna families. they are the signatures of 23 % mirna families in viridiplantae, of 27 % mirna families in fabaceae and of 36 % mirna families in p. vulgaris. the signature ccc is found in only one mirna family in viridiplantae, and is absent in all mirna families in fabaceae as well as in p. vulgaris. in fabaceae, eight signatures are absent in all mirna families, while  <dig> signatures are found only in one mirna family. in p. vulgaris,  <dig> out of  <dig> signatures are absent in all mirna families. the relative distribution of the ssr signatures in the viridiplantae, fabaceae and p. vulgaris is shown in fig.  <dig> table  <dig> distribution of ssr signatures in various mirna families of viridiplantae, fabaceae and p. vulgaris

prediction of new mirnas in p. vulgaris
the known viridiplantae mirnas from the mirbase  <dig> were used as query in the blast search with the est and gss sequences of p. vulgaris as subject. from the blast results satisfying the conditions mentioned in the ‘materials and methods’ section, a total of  <dig> , <dig> sequences were extracted with all possible lengths. these sequences were used in blastx to identify and remove the protein coding sequences. after removal, the number of sequences reduced to  <dig> , <dig>  these sequences were examined for the seven criteria mentioned in the ‘materials and methods’ section, and only those fulfilling these criteria were retained as the predicted pre-mirs. in case of multiple sequences resulted from a single blast hit, the one which fulfils all the seven criteria with the maximum mfei and the maximum r was retained. finally,  <dig> sequences were obtained and were designated as putative pre-mirs in p. vulgaris. extraction of the mature mirnas from these  <dig> pre-mirs resulted in  <dig> new mirnas, of which  <dig> are novel. these new mirnas belong to  <dig> mirna families in p. vulgaris . fig.  <dig> shows a particular mirna ‘pvu-mir399a’ that fulfils all the seven criteria used for the prediction.fig.  <dig> secondary structure of a pre-mir  showing the mature mirna sequence highlighted in blue



the distribution of  <dig> newly predicted mirnas in p vulgaris varies among the  <dig> mirna families . four of the families namely mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> are the most populated families with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively, while  <dig> families contain only one member. in the remaining  <dig> families, the number of mirna varies from  <dig> to  <dig>  this is in accordance with the diversity observed in other plant species  <cit> . the length distribution of newly predicted mirnas  shows that the length of mature mirnas fall within the range of 15– <dig> nucleotides with an average length of  <dig> nucleotide . however, mirna pvu-mir848f is the only exception with the length of  <dig> nucleotides.table  <dig> distribution of mirnas within different mirna families of p. vulgaris

experimental validation of the predicted mirnas in p. vulgaris
deep-sequencing of p. vulgaris small rna library generated a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads. the low quality reads as well the reads with lower than  <dig> nucleotide length were removed, resulting in  <dig> , <dig> reads. the reads were made unique using fastx_collapser. the sequencing data obtained was blast searched with predicted mirnas. the presence of  <dig>  of the predicted mirnas in p. vulgaris is confirmed from the sequencing data.

qrt-pcr was used to experimentally validate our computational method and to compare the results with the sequencing data. a total of  <dig> computationally predicted mirnas were randomly chosen  and qrt-pcr was done for these five mirnas. ct values were calculated using u <dig> snrna as a normaliser gene. the relative quantity of each mirna to u <dig> snrna was expressed using the formula 2-Δct  <cit> , where Δct =  . the expression profiles obtained by qrt-pcr analysis mostly agreed with the expression values obtained from the sequencing data of these  <dig> mirnas . for pvu-mir1519a, in qrt-pcr, the ct value obtained is quite high  indicating that it is a very low expressed mirna and this result correlated with the sequencing data where the number of reads of this mirna is only  <dig> . for pvu-mir5368b, the number of reads obtained from sequencing data is  <dig> , the same value for pvu-mir5368a also, however, the relative expression obtained in qrt-pcr for pvu-mir5368b is lower than that of pvu-mir5368a. this may be due to the fact that pvu-mir5368b expression is relatively low in leaves compare to other tissues. several studies already have established that mirna expression can vary widely in different tissues or at different developmental stages  <cit> .table  <dig> stem-loop reverse transcription primers for selected mirnas

the computational method developed in this study was used to predict the mirnas of a. thaliana and the results were compared with known mirnas of a. thaliana . the mirnas from viridiplantae excluding those from a. thaliana and the genome of a. thaliana were used as the inputs for prediction pipeline. a total of  <dig> mirnas  were predicted, of which  <dig> are already reported in mirbase  <dig>  the same procedure was repeated for g. max. a total of  <dig> mirnas  were predicted, of which  <dig> are already reported in mirbase  <dig>  the performance of the prediction method is measured using parameters sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value  and negative predictive value . our computational prediction method has a high sensitivity of  <dig>  as well as high specificity of  <dig>  .table  <dig> statistical parameters to measure accuracy of prediction method

prediction of the mirna targets in p. vulgaris
the psrnatarget server was used to predict the mirna targets. the default sequences of the target candidates in the server are of old version, hence the updated est sequences of p. vulgaris from ncbi genbank were used as target candidates. for  <dig> mirnas that belong to  <dig> families,  <dig> target sequences were predicted. in order to characterise the targets, blastx was used with the predicted target sequences as query and the entire protein sequences of viridiplantae as subject. using 80 % sequence identity cut-off,  <dig> targets for  <dig> mirnas were characterised . for additional  <dig> targets for  <dig> mirnas, the blastx predicted uncharacterised and hypothetical proteins. the hybridized structures of mature pvu-mir166d with its two targets, est  <dig> coding for udp-n-acetyl glucosamine pyrophosphorylase protein and est  <dig> coding for snf1-related protein kinase regulatory subunit are shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> hybridized structure of mature mirna with its targets. the mature mirna forms the 5′ end and the target is at the 3′ end separated by  <dig> nucleotides. the pvu-mir166d with its two targets:  est  <dig> coding for udp-n-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase protein regulated by cleavage,  est  <dig> coding for snf1-related protein kinase regulatory subunit inhibited by translational regulation



discussion
in the last decade, numerous studies confirmed that plant mirnas are directly involved in developmental processes such as seed germination, morphogenesis, floral organ identity, root development, vegetative and reproductive phase change, flowering initiation and seed production . in addition to their important functions in organ development, plant mirnas play a crucial role at the core of gene regulatory networks. they are involved in various biotic and abiotic stress responses,  signal transduction and protein degradation  <cit> . plant mirnas also play an important role in the biogenesis of small rnas  and in the feedback regulation of sirna pathways.

in the present study, using computational methods, we have identified  <dig> new mirnas in p. vulgaris of which  <dig> are novel. of these  <dig> predicted mirnas,  <dig> were validated through small rna sequencing. in general, computational prediction of mirnas uses a highly constrained search space by setting fixed values to parameters like au content, mfei and the length of the pre-mirs  <cit> . constraining the parameters to a fixed cut-off value reduces the number of predicted mirnas. it is already an established fact that the commonly used parameters namely the length of pre-mirs, au content and mfei are highly variable, ranging between 43– <dig>  17 %–92 % and  <dig> – <dig> , respectively. the distribution of nd, npb and nq  in mirnas is significantly different from other small rnas, making them good candidates as prediction parameters. however, there is also an overlapping region in the distribution, which can result in false positives while predicting using single parameter. thus using a combination of these parameters will make the prediction pipeline more robust. in the present study, instead of using the conventional computational procedure, where all the prediction parameters are set to a fixed value, we have used a 99 % probability range. initial application of fixed cut-off values for various parameters resulted in only  <dig> new mirnas in p. vulgaris. this low number of mirnas prompted us to use the 99 % probability range with the anticipation of getting better prediction. after using the 99 % probability range for the first six parameters described in the ‘materials and methods’ section,  <dig> pre-mirs in p. vulgaris were predicted, which is almost hundred times compared to the conventional method. however, it should be noted that the increased number includes both new predictions as well as false positives. false positives are eliminated by using the rna folding parameters and conserved ssr signature.

the presence of ssrs in pre-mirnas is already established , although their specific role in pre-mirs is still unknown. most of the ssrs in pre-mirs have few steady characteristics, allowing their identification in pre-mirs feasible. thus conserved ssr signatures are a potential parameter in predicting new mirnas. in the present study, we have used the conserved ssr signatures as a prediction parameter. by using this parameter, the predicted number of  <dig> p. vulgaris pre-mirs was reduced to  <dig>  we have identified the ssr signatures for all the viridiplantae mirnas present in the mirbase  <dig> , and these signatures can be used for the identification of new mirnas in any species of viridiplantae.

along with the ssr, we have also used nq, nd and npb in our prediction. after filtering the putative pre-mirs through these four parameters, the length, au content and mfei for the predicted pre-mirs of p. vulgaris vary from 55– <dig>  33–77 % and  <dig> – <dig> , respectively. these values are in agreement with known pre-mirs in viridiplantae. these four independent parameters do not restrict the physical and thermodynamic features of pre-mirs to fixed values, and can be used for successful prediction of new mirnas in plants.

the mirbase  <dig> contains  <dig> mature mirnas of viridiplantae. analysis of these  <dig> mirnas revealed that more than 70 % of them belong to the  <dig> well-studied plant species namely medicago truncatula, oryza sativa, glycine max, brachypodium distachyon, populus trichocarpa, arabidopsis lyrata, solanum tuberosum, arabidopsis thaliana, zea mays, physcomitrella patens, sorghum bicolor, prunus persica and malus domestica. further we find that, each of these  <dig> species have more than  <dig> mature mirnas reported in the mirbase. in the present study, prediction of the  <dig> mature mirnas in p. vulgaris is in accordance with this finding, thus justifying our modified computational prediction method.

in order to validate the computationally predicted mirnas, small rna library was prepared from the anupam cultivar of p. vulgaris. the quality reads with more than  <dig> nucleotide length were blast searched with the predicted mirnas. out of the  <dig> predicted mirnas,  <dig> are expressed in the sequenced sample. the read numbers for mirnas showed high diversity, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  for the expressed mirnas. among these mirnas, the mir <dig> family had the most number of reads. for all the identified mirnas, transcript per million  was also calculated. the dataset of known pre-mirs downloaded from the mirbase  <dig> contains mirnas deposited from different cultivars of p. vulgaris at different developmental stages. however, the small rna library created for sequencing is from a single cultivar of p. vulgaris at a particular stage of development, which makes it impossible for all the predicted  <dig> mirnas to be present in the sequence library. the presence of nearly fifty percent of the predicted mirnas in the sequencing data justifies our method followed in computational prediction of mirnas.

additionally, five randomly selected computationally predicted mirnas were validated using qrt-pcr. relative expressions obtained in the qrt-pcr mostly corroborated the sequencing data; only slight variation for pvu-mir5368b can be attributed to the fact that mirna expression widely varies in different tissues and this particular mirna may have relatively low expression in leaf tissues. the validation of the five randomly selected predicted mirnas in both qrt-pcr and illumina sequencing substantiate our computational method for the prediction of mirnas.

all the newly predicted  <dig> mirnas in p. vulgaris belong to  <dig> mirna families. we find that of these  <dig> families, only  <dig> contain mirnas distributed into  <dig> plant species. although, these mirna families have a wide species range, yet low number of mirnas are present from the species of fabaceae family . there are  <dig> mirna families containing a single mirna from one of the species of fabaceae, showing the under representation of mirnas of fabaceae in the mirbase. fabaceae, one of the most important families in the dicotyledonae  <cit> , is rich in high quality protein, providing high nutritional food crops for agriculture all over the world. our prediction of  <dig> new mirnas in p. vulgaris as well as identification and characterisation of their targets will enrich the present knowledge of fabaceae mirnas, and will definitely help in deciphering the role of mirnas in different regulatory mechanisms.table  <dig> distribution of fabaceae species in various mirna families



mirbase  <dig> contains  <dig> mature mirnas of a. thaliana of which  <dig> homologs are present in other species of viridiplantae. the rest of the known mirnas  from a. thaliana have no known homolog in other plant species, making them difficult to predict. we have also predicted  <dig> mirnas of the known homologs from a total prediction of  <dig> mirnas in a. thaliana. besides, we also predicted  <dig> mirnas in g. max of which  <dig> exists in mirbase  <dig> . this successful prediction not only validates our method, but also establishes that the method can be applied to predict the mirnas in any other plant species.

the prediction method can be evaluated using various statistical parameters such as sensitivity, specificity, ppv and npv. sensitivity measures the proportion of mirnas which are correctly identified by the prediction pipeline, whereas specificity measures the proportion of sequences which are correctly rejected. our prediction method shows both high sensitivity and specificity when tested for known mirnas of a. thaliana and g. max . the parameters ppv and npv measures the probability of predicted or rejected sequences to be true mirnas or not, respectively. higher values of ppv and sensitivity give us a high confidence for a positive prediction, while higher values of npv and specificity give us high confidence for the rejection

recently, numerous studies suggested that the genomic distribution of ssrs are nonrandom, and the ssrs located in gene or regulatory regions play important role in chromatin organization, regulation of gene activity, recombination, dna replication, cell cycle, mismatch repair system  <cit> . the transcriptome survey of several plant species showed the high abundance of di- and tri-nucleotide repeats compare to tetra-, penta- and hexa nucleotide repeats; n repeat being the most frequently occurring microsatellites in plant genomes . the microsatellites in the genomic sequences play vital role in the biogenesis of several small non-coding rnas, of which most important are the mirnas. transcriptome analysis of several plants revealed that a significant percentage of the unigenes constitutes ‘ssr bearing pre-mirna candidates’  <cit> , suggesting that ssrs are an important component of pre-mirs. ssrs in pre-mirs are derived from independent transcriptional units and often relate to function  <cit> . variations of ssrs within pre-mirs are very critical for normal mirna activity as expansion or contraction of ssrs in pre-mirs directly affects the corresponding mirna products and may cause unpredicted changes  <cit> . these characteristics features foster exploit of ssr signature as a critical parameter in mirna identification  <cit> . the number of mirnas predicted in the traditional method is too low and we have introduced 99 % probability region for increasing the search space. however, this has increased the number of false predictions. as a result of this, the number of mirnas predicted before the ssr filtering step for a. thaliana and g. max are  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in spite of these high numbers of predictions, by using ssr the final numbers of predicted mirnas were restricted to  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively in these two species. the specificity of our prediction method improved from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in a. thaliana and  <dig>  to  <dig>  in g. max, by applying ssr filtration step. thus ssr signatures act as an effective filtering parameter in limiting the number of false positives to acceptable limits.

the mature mirna sequences and est sequences of p. vulgaris were submitted to the psrnatarget server for the prediction of targets. the parameters were adjusted as described in ‘materials and methods’ section for better prediction. the hpsize  <cit>  was changed according to the length of mirna, as the server uses a value assuming the length of mirna as  <dig> nucleotides. the mirnas with length lesser than hpsize were ignored by the server pipeline. the length of the mirnas predicted in the present study varies from 14– <dig> nucleotides. the sequence length of central mismatch was also changed according to the length of the mirna. this parameter helps to predict the targets inhibited by translational regulation and has no effect on targets inhibited by cleavage of mrna sequence  <cit> . further, the maximum expectation value was set to  <dig>  for stringent filtering of false positive targets predicted by the server.

in the present study,  <dig> targets were predicted for  <dig> mirnas. of these  <dig> targets, functional information was retrieved for  <dig> targets distributed in  <dig> mirna families. in majority of the cases, the predicted targets in this study were in accordance with the already published reports in other plant species. yu et al.  <cit>  showed that mir <dig> family control plant development by regulating the trichome growth in arabidopsis. it is already established that myb transcription factors are the negative controllers of the trichome growth. the mir <dig> family targets the myb transcription factor mrnas, and by cleaving these transcription factors they positively control the trichome growth. we also found that the predicted pvu-mir156d target the myb transcription factors. in the present study pvu-mir166d was predicted to target kinase mrna, which is in agreement with the reported target kinase for mir <dig> family in soybean  <cit> . calvino and messing  <cit>  established that mir <dig> family in sorghum targets the carboxypeptidase mrnas. similarly, in the present study, pvu-mir169b was predicted to target the carboxyl-terminal-processing protease. scarecrow-like transcription factor is already an established target for mir <dig> family in arabidopsis  <cit>  and oryza sativa  <cit> . similar results were obtained in our study where pvu-mir171a was predicted to bind scarecrow-like transcription factor. atp sulfyrylase responsible for sulphur  uptake and assimilation is the target for mir <dig> family in arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> . newly identified pvu-mir395a was also predicted to target the atp sulfyrylase. in arabidopsis, it was found that mir <dig> family targets the tubulin mrnas  <cit> . our prediction was in accordance with this finding, showing that pvu-mir396b targets gamma tubulin. basic blue proteins  are validated targets for mir <dig> family in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . similar target was predicted for pvu-mir408a. the predicted target fatty acid desaturase of pvu-mir902c in our study is in agreement with the findings of wan et al.  <cit>  showing that the targets of mir <dig> are primarily involved in lipid metabolism.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have used computational method to identify new mirnas in p. vulgaris and few of them were experimentally validated. we have used conserved ssr signatures to predict new mirnas. we have identified  <dig> new mirnas belonging to  <dig> different families of mirnas in p. vulgaris, of which  <dig> are novel. we have also predicted  <dig> targets for  <dig> of these mirnas. we successfully predicted known mirnas in a. thaliana and g. max using our method. presently, numerous mirnas from various plant species have been identified and characterized by the aid of next-generation sequencing. however, there is still inadequate information of mirnas in many plant species. identification of new mirnas in all plant species and deciphering their functions is the present day challenge in biological discoveries. wet-lab experiments have their own limitations and the alternate approach is in silico methods for mirna studies. in silico methods can rapidly identify new mirnas and their targets in any species. the computational approach that we have developed can be successfully applied to identify new mirnas and their targets in any plant species, and is expected to generate an optimal framework for deciphering the biogenesis, functions, and mechanisms of plant mirnas that are not yet discovered.
