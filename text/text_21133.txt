BACKGROUND
the success of linkage mapping in mendelian traits led to great optimism that the same approach could be harnessed to identify genes in disorders or traits without clear mendelian inheritance patterns, so called complex or quantitative traits. in contrast to phenotypes that are controlled by single genes, in complex traits there is no clear-cut mode of transmission. it is likely that quantitative traits are influenced by many genes of small effect size , with factors such as gene-gene interactions , pleiotropy, and gene-environment interactions complicating matters further  <cit> .

although many linkage screens for complex disorders have been reported, linkage studies are underpowered to detect genes of small effect size  <cit> . in contrast, case-control association analysis, even using stringent significance levels, promises to provide the power required to detect qtls that are too weak to be detected by linkage analysis alone  <cit> . however, this power comes at an expense, as a systematic genome wide association study requires very large numbers of dna markers, perhaps as many as  <dig>   <cit> . furthermore, the ability to detect qtls of small effect size requires large samples. for example, 80% power  to detect an effect of  <dig> % in an unselected sample requires samples of at least  <dig> individuals  <cit> .

consequently, considerable effort has gone into developing high-throughput genotyping methodologies that allow the genotyping of dense marker sets in large sample sizes quickly, accurately, with minimal optimisation and very low unit cost  <cit> . until such technologies become widely available, one way to address the cost, time and labour involved in using large sample sizes is to perform analyses not on individual dna samples, but on pools made up of dna from multiple individuals for cases and for controls, a technique that can dramatically reduce the genotyping burden  <cit> . there is a growing literature addressing methodological issues such as dna pool construction, genotyping assays, and statistical analysis  <cit> , and the strengths and weaknesses of dna pooling have recently been reviewed  <cit> . dna pooling has been used successfully to identify replicated associations with complex traits  <cit> . however, using the current snp genotyping methodologies on dna pools even for a small number of dna pools for a dense marker set is still labour-intensive and expensive. one solution to the problem of genotyping many dna markers is snp genotyping microarrays which use a one-primer assay to genotype thousands of snps, offering the first real hope of a systematic survey of dna variation in the human genome. however, microarrays can be used only once and are expensive in studies consisting of the large samples needed to detect qtls of small effect size. one solution to the qtl conundrum is to combine both dna pooling and snp microarrays, an approach that we call snp-map , which can dramatically reduce the cost of screening large numbers of snps on large samples.

we hypothesised that quantitative estimates of allele frequencies – especially the relative allele frequencies comparing groups like cases and controls – can be derived from pooled dna using snp genotyping microarrays, similar to the way that expression microarrays estimate quantitative frequencies for mrna transcripts  <cit> .

affymetrix software  uses the hybridisation fluorescence signals from the snp microarrays to generate 'relative allele signals' , a ratio of the measurement of allele a to the summed measurement of alleles a and b. thus, ras values vary between  <dig>  and  <dig> . two independent ras values are derived for each snp from the sense strand  and the anti-sense strand . as explained in the methods, affymetrix software plots ras <dig> scores against ras <dig> scores and uses empirically derived clustering information to trichotomise these ras scores as genotypes for dna of an individual. ras values near  <dig>  are identified as a bb homozygote,  <dig>  as an ab heterozygote, and  <dig>  as an aa homozygote. we propose that ras values can be used as quantitative indexes of allele frequencies in dna pools.

the purpose of our current report is to follow up our previous study that addressed the feasibility of snp-map  <cit> . we explore the reliability validity and sensitivity of snp-map in greater detail using affymetrix genechip® mapping  <dig> k array xba  <dig> which genotypes more than  <dig>  snps.

we constructed a control dna pool consisting of  <dig> individuals independently three times , each assayed on triplicate microarrays. we used these replicate control pools to assess the reliability of estimating allele frequencies from pooled dna. to assess validity and sensitivity, we compared allele frequency estimates from microarray assays using pooled dna to individual genotyping. in addition, in order to assess sensitivity experimentally, we reconstructed two 'case' dna pools that differed by 15% and 20% in allele frequencies from the controls by spiking an aliquot of a control pool with an individual's dna who was also individually genotyped on the microarray. each case pool was assayed on duplicate microarrays.

RESULTS
validation of pool construction
before using the microarrays, we genotyped the  <dig> dna pools for  <dig> snps using snapshot™ ddntp primer extension reaction kit  in order to confirm that the control dna pools a, b and c were representative of the  <dig> individuals used to construct the pools. the results indicated that pool construction was valid in that, for the three snps, the pools yielded similar allele frequency estimates. most importantly, these estimates, and especially their averages across the pools, are highly similar to the allele frequencies based on individual genotyping. for example, the average pooled allele frequencies  and individual genotyping allele frequencies, respectively, were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for rs <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  for rs <dig>  and  <dig>  and  <dig>  for rs <dig>  snapshot™ has previously been shown to estimate pool allele frequencies with a high degree of accuracy if k is applied  <cit> .

summary of  <dig> k genechip results for pooled dna
we consistently obtained good signal detection rates across all  <dig> microarrays used in the study, with an average signal detection of  <dig> %  using the default analysis parameters. snps were excluded if there was inadequate discrimination between specific versus non-specific hybridisation of dna to the probes.

we obtained ras <dig> and ras <dig> values for  <dig> snps across all  <dig> microarrays for the control pools a, b and c. for the spiked pools, ras <dig> and ras <dig> values were obtained for  <dig> snps for the 15% spiked pool and  <dig> snps for the 20% spiked pools.

validation: comparing allele frequencies from pooled dna and population estimates
we have previously shown that an average of ras <dig> and ras <dig> values  estimate pooled allele frequencies more accurately then ras <dig> or ras <dig> alone  <cit> .

rasav values were calculated for each snp on the  <dig> microarrays for each of the  <dig> dna control pools. these rasav values were then averaged across the  <dig> microarrays. the resulting allelic frequency estimates from pooled dna were correlated with snp allele frequencies determined by individually genotyping for an independent caucasian sample. the latter data are publicly available from the netaffx™ analysis centre , a web-based tool providing extensive annotation for each snp on the  <dig> k microarray derived from affymetrix internal validation studies.

in figure 1a, the allele frequency estimates from pooled dna were not corrected for unequal amplification of the two alleles that can occur with pooled dna. that is, when two alleles are present in equal amounts , the allele measurements obtained should be of equal size or intensity. however, for to various reasons  <cit>  equal representation of alleles may not occur.

this bias is corrected by applying a factor, k  <cit> , where k = a/b, using the equation: a = a/, where a and b are the measurements of the a and b alleles. k corrections for the snps on the affymetrix  <dig> k microarray were available from a panel of  <dig> caucasian individuals assayed on separate microarrays and applied to each snp .

the range of k values is very tight, with only a handful of outliers considering the enormous number of snps under investigation.  <dig>  of  <dig>  snps have k values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the averaged k over  <dig>  snps is  <dig> , median =  <dig> , max =  <dig>  min =  <dig> . it should be noted that in relation to a case-control study design, unless k is extreme and allele frequencies rare, k correction would not significantly impact on relative allele frequency differences between cases and controls, although absolute allele frequency estimates would alter. in other words, although k correction is needed to compare allelic frequency estimates from pooled dna and individual genotyping, it is not needed for comparisons between cases and controls.

validation: comparing allele frequencies for pooled dna and individual genotyping
in addition to using the netaffx™ population data, we individually genotyped the  <dig> individuals used to construct the control pool for  <dig> snps. the results are shown in figure  <dig>  as expected, the  <dig> snp allele frequencies generated by the micorarrays are highly correlated  with the netaffx™ population data, and correlate even better with the individual genotyping data for individuals in the pool . the mean difference between microarray estimates and individual genotyping was . <dig>  when k correction was applied, the correlation between k-corrected microarray estimates and individual genotyping increased to  <dig> , and the mean difference between k-corrected microarray estimates was attenuated from . <dig> to . <dig> 

estimation of experimental errors
the previous analyses are based on rasav values averaged across the  <dig> microarrays. in order to assess the technical reliability of deriving allele frequency estimates from the dna pools, we compared rasav for the three technical replicates within each dna pool and between the three dna pools.  as expected given the high correlation between pooled estimates and individual genotyping, correlations of rasav values within pool triplicates are very high , as are correlations between pools . the dispersion of the rasav values cross the nine control microarrays is encouragingly narrow: all but  <dig> sems are under  <dig>  and  <dig>  are  <dig>  or less.

for those snps where we have ras values across all  <dig> pools , the median standard deviation is . <dig>  using this figure to estimate the power of a hypothetical experiment where we have the same number of case pools, for a . <dig> significance level we would have 80% power to detect an allelic frequency difference of  <dig> , and virtual certainty of detecting an allelic frequency difference of  <dig> .

by fitting a random intercept model for each snp to the  <dig> rasav values, it is possible to estimate the variance components attributable to pool construction  and the measurement error . σ and τ are assumed to be independently normally distributed. the distribution of  is quite similar to the overall standard deviation  because tau is, as expected, quite small, ranging from  <dig> × 10- <dig> to  <dig> × 10- <dig>  with a median of  <dig> × 10- <dig>  an estimate of  <dig> × 10- <dig> has been made from comparable pools using different methods  <cit> .

sensitivity
the sensitivity of snp-map was assessed empirically in a spiking experiment in which 15% and 20% of one individual's dna was added to control pool d to create two new pools analogous to 'case' pools. each of the spiked pools was assessed on duplicate microarrays. the individual's dna was also genotyped on a microarray in order to calculate the allelic frequencies of the spiked pools.

based on the power calculations presented above, in this spiking experiment we would expect to have roughly 52% power to detect allelic frequency differences of  <dig>  between the control and spiked pools. this is less than the power estimate from the control dna pools because here we have only two replicates of each spiked pool, and nine replicates of the control pool, which is equivalent to having equal groups of n =  <dig>  . the expected differences in the spiked pool are dependent upon the original allele frequencies in the control pool because we used a fixed total amount of . for the snps where the expected allele frequency difference in the 15% and 20% spiked pools was more than  <dig>  and we had complete data , a significant t-test difference was observed for  <dig> snps , supporting our predicted power calculations. as shown in table  <dig>  the observed and predicted differences between spiked  and control correspond well on average over the entire frequency range, although the predicted allele frequency differences are greater than the observed differences. the expected allele frequencies are calculated from frequencies measured in the control pools, and are greatest for low frequency alleles, some of which appear low by chance due to measurement error. the apparent bias shown in table  <dig> is thus due to regression to the mean.

discussion
we have demonstrated that the snp-map method can tackle the qtl problem of large samples and large numbers of snps. specifically, allele frequencies can be accurately estimated from pooled dna allelotyped on microarrays using the sophisticated allele-specific hybridisation method packaged in the commercially available affymetrix genechip® system. the validity and sensitivity of the snp-map method was shown by the correlation of  <dig>  between estimates of allele frequency from pooled dna and individual genotyping. the sensitivity 'spiking' experiment confirmed these estimates, suggesting that case-control pool allele frequency differences on the order of  <dig>  could be detected above the noise of measurement error using this method. with this level of sensitivity, the snp-map approach should be able to detect qtls of modest effect size if large samples are used. the benefit of dna pooling is that large samples cost no more to genotype than small samples.

these results make it reasonable to proceed to case-control studies of complex traits. for example, we are using the snp-map method in a large-scale study of children of low versus high reading ability. in an actual association study, sampling variation is added to the parameters considered in the present study which focused on technical replicates within and between dna pools of the same group of individuals and compared allele frequency estimates for pooled dna from this group of individuals to individual genotyping. however, in an actual association study, pooled dna estimates are not compared within and between pools of the same individuals but rather between different pools consisting of different individuals. for this reason, in an actual association study, sampling variation would be considered and could be estimated parametrically by including in the design sub-pools of independent samples of cases and controls. this would permit the use of standard parametric statistics comparing the mean allelic frequencies of cases and controls in which n is the number of subpools. in addition, using at least two microarrays on each subpool would alleviate technical variation between microarrays and sub-pools. it should be emphasised that dna pooling is best construed as nominating snps that are then confirmed with individual genotyping.

we have used the quantitative ras values, designed to produce a robust allele call when assessed for individuals, to estimate allele frequencies for pooled dna. it is likely that a more elegant way can be found to derive an allele frequency estimate from the  <dig> oligonucleotide probes present for each snp . for example, it has been reported in a study of gene expression differences that increased power can be obtained by testing for differences for each probe rather than for differences averaged over the entire probe set level  <cit> .

the tests used here were not corrected for multiple testing because the intent is to use this method not as a definitive analysis, but rather as a rapid initial screen to reduce the number of candidate snps to be submitted to individual genotyping for the large samples needed to detect qtls of small effect size. with  <dig>  snps, a large number of false positive results are expected by chance and so we recommend using a multi-stage replication design in order to balance false positives and false negatives in the selection of snps for individual genotyping  <cit> .

our analyses of snp-map were based on the  <dig>  snp microarray, but should also be applicable to the  <dig> k affymetrix genechip® system launched in june  <dig> and the  <dig> k affymetrix genechip® system scheduled for the end of  <dig>  although the snps on the affymetrix arrays are chosen on the basis of coverage of the whole genome ,  <dig>  snps approaches a comprehensive genome scan for association based on linkage disequilibrium. the snp-map approach will also be relevant to other types of snp microarrays such as a microarray that emerges from the exon re-sequencing project at the sanger centre which aims to identify all nonsynonymous , which are likely to be functional because the polymorphism involves an amino acid difference in translation. microarrays with functional snps will facilitate direct association analyses with increased power as compared to indirect association analyses based on linkage disequilibrium  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have shown that the snp-map method is a reliable and powerful approach to screen thousands of loci using large sample sizes. employing case-control designs using snp-map will speed-up the snp nomination process for individual genotyping, and thus help detect snps of small effect size more efficiently.
