BACKGROUND
in placental mammals, the x and y chromosomes share homology only in the pseudoautosomal regions . par length varies greatly among species, ranging from only 700 kb in mouse  <cit> , to  <dig>  mb  in human  <cit>  and  <dig>  mb in dog  <cit>  . in the mouse, all chromosomes are acrocentric, and the par localizes at the tip of the long q arm of the sex chromosomes. the human metacentric x and y chromosomes have two pars, one on each end of the sex chromosomes. however, usually only par <dig>  at the end of the p arm of the human sex chromosomes, engages in meiotic recombination  <cit> . the single dog par localizes to the tip of the xp and yq arms. the total length of the dog y is only approximately 20 mb, which is relatively short compared to the human and mouse y chromosomes with a length of 60 mb and 95 mb, respectively. in contrast, the x chromosome is highly conserved in evolution, measuring  <dig>   <dig>  and 124 mb in human, mouse, and dog, respectively . the presence of a heterologous chromosome pair in males poses a challenge to male meiosis, and has specific consequences for the transcriptional activity of the sex chromosomes during spermatogenesis as explained below.figure  <dig> dog, human, and mouse sex chromosomes. schematic drawing of the dog, human, and mouse sex chromosomes. the par regions are shown in blue. the location of centromeres is indicated by a black box, and the heterochromatic areas on the y chromosomes are shown in dark gray. p and q arms are indicated.



in the first meiotic division, homologous chromosomes need to segregate faithfully, to generate two daughter cells that both carry a haploid set of chromosomes. this requires a lengthy prophase during which each chromosome pairs, and exchanges genetic information with its homologous partner. this process involves the formation of approximately  <dig> meiotic dna double-strand breaks   <cit>  by the transesterase spo <dig>  <cit>  at so-called hotspots  <cit>  distributed throughout the genome. subsequently, repair of these dsbs occurs via a meiosis-specific adaptation of the somatic homologous recombination  repair process. hr in meiotic prophase cells is thought to prefer the use of the intact dna from the homologous chromosome as a template for repair, whereas the sister chromatid is the favoured repair template in somatic g <dig> cells  <cit> . this preference for the homologous chromosome in meiosis is known as the interhomolog bias  <cit> . based on this bias, the meiosis-specific hr repair mechanism helps chromosome pairing and allows complete homologous synapsis through the formation of the synaptonemal complex   <cit> . the meiotic hr machinery also ensures formation of at least one crossover for each chromosome pair, which is required for faithful segregation of homologous chromosomes and the sex chromosomes during the first meiotic metaphase to anaphase transition. all these events can be traced via immunocytochemical localization of key players in the hr repair process and markers of sc formation. rad <dig> and dmc <dig> are recombinases that form foci in response to the formation of dsbs by spo <dig>  and each focus is thought to correspond to a dsb site  <cit> . sc formation reaches completion as dsb repair proceeds. the initial formation of the axial elements, that form first along each chromosomal axis, can be followed by staining for its components, such as sycp <dig>  sycp <dig>  <cit> , and the hormad proteins  <cit> . subsequently, formation of the central or transverse elements, that provide the “glue” between the homologous chromosomes as they synapse, can be followed by staining for components of the transverse filaments and central element such as sycp <dig>  <cit>  and tex <dig>  <cit> .

stable xy synapsis in mouse and man is observed only for the tips of these chromosomes that contain the par  <cit> . detailed electron microscopic evaluation of the xy pair in mouse spermatocytes has revealed that the synapsis between x and y is dynamic, whereby the region that displays synapsis varies between  <dig>  and 3 μm. when synapsis is maximal, approximately 90% of the complete y-chromosomal axis is synapsed  <cit> . the unsynapsed configuration of the heterologous x and y chromosomal axes is detected throughout meiotic prophase. sex chromosomes are thus faced with a particular challenge in repairing meiotic dsbs in the non-pars. asynapsis and persistence of unrepaired dsbs lead to global transcriptional repression, a process called meiotic sex chromosome inactivation  . on the other hand, pars, where synapsis and repair can proceed similarly as on autosomes, are generally thought to escape from msci  <cit> , but so far this has not been analysed.

in mouse, inactive xy chromatin forms a distinct nuclear domain, the so-called xy body, which usually resides at the periphery of the nucleus and can be cytologically distinguished by its: 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole -intense appearance  <cit> . xy body formation has been observed in a variety of different mammals  <cit> . transcriptional suppression of x and y has been reported to persist in post-meiotic spermatids in mouse and human, and is referred to as post-meiotic sex chromatin repression   <cit> . pscr, despite being a direct consequence of msci, appears to be less stringent, since a significant number of x-linked genes are post-meiotically reactivated . transcriptomic studies of msci and pscr have so far been performed only in mouse and human, using microarray analyses of rna purified from different germ cell types  <cit> , or whole testes  <cit> . more recently, also rna sequencing approaches have been used to analyse global and sex chromosome transcriptional regulation during spermatogenesis in the mouse  <cit> . msci appears to be a male-specific specialization of a more general process, meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin , that silences chromatin that remains unsynapsed during male and female meiotic prophase in mammals  <cit> . although msuc shares several epigenetic characteristics with msci, these phenomena seem to lead to opposite end results: msci must successfully be installed in order for spermatocytes to progress through the meiotic prophase  <cit> , whereas occurrence of msuc could be detrimental to the meiotic cells  <cit> . whether msuc and msci are equally effective is not known, since no global analyses of mrna expression from regions that are subject to msuc are available. based on immunocytochemical analyses, it appears that some components of a shared msci/msuc machinery are limiting, and when msuc is activated in spermatocytes, this reduces the effectiveness of msci  <cit> . meiotic and post-meiotic x chromosome silencing was reported to be similarly effective for mouse and man  <cit> . however, when we analysed publicly available microarray data from human testes, the results indicated that msci and pscr might be less complete in human compared to mouse  <cit> , and this notion was supported by immunocytological observations that indicated that msci was less stringently controlled in human compared to mouse  <cit> . furthermore, the profiles of x-linked genes escaping from pscr diverge significantly between humans and mice  <cit> . thus, detailed analysis of msci and pscr in other mammalian species might help in understanding common and relevant features of these processes and identify new important candidate x-linked fertility genes.

in the past, we have studied the functional links between sex chromosome pairing, dsb repair, and transcriptional silencing in several species  <cit> , and here we have focused on the regulation of the sex chromosomes during male meiotic prophase in the dog , because of its long par , and some peculiar features of xy pairing during meiotic prophase. the last common ancestor of mouse, human and the domestic dog lived around  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the diploid genome of the dog consists of  <dig> autosomal pairs and the sex chromosomal pair  <cit> . previously, the general pattern of meiotic recombination during dog meiotic prophase has been studied through staining for the mismatch repair protein mlh <dig>  which also marks crossover sites in spermatocytes of mouse and man  <cit> .

herein, we first provide a detailed description of the assembly and disassembly of the synaptonemal complex during canine spermatogenesis. we show that the dog x chromosome displays extensive self-synapsis during mid pachytene, contributing to a more rapid meiotic dsb repair along the self-synapsed part of the x chromosome and to early loss of msci marks. these observations, together with the availability of complete high coverage genome sequencing for this species, prompted us to study msci and pscr more in detail by rna sequencing. we show that x self-synapsis is associated with a partial escape from msci. in contrast to what has been previously suggested  <cit> , the par, at least in dog, has very low transcriptional activity in both spermatocytes and spermatids. in addition, our comparative analysis among dog, mouse and human of post-meiotically down- and up-regulated genes, provides new potential targets in the search for candidate x-linked male fertility genes.

RESULTS
extensive x self-synapsis in dog mid pachytene spermatocytes
the progression of meiotic prophase and synapsis in canine spermatocytes was studied by immunostaining for sycp <dig>  and sycp <dig> . at leptotene , short fragments of sycp <dig> appear throughout the nucleus, some of which become associated with sycp <dig> fragments . in zygotene nuclei , longer stretches of sycp <dig> and sycp <dig> are present, in agreement with the known progression of synapsis between the homologous chromosomes. however, the sycp <dig> pattern appears a bit more dotted compared to what can be observed in mouse zygotene spermatocytes. in pachytene nuclei , sc assembly was found to be complete on all autosomes, and sycp <dig> and sycp <dig> completely co-localize, indicating full synapsis. diplotene nuclei were very rare , indicating that this stage is very short in the dog . again, sycp <dig> was observed in a dotted pattern, whereas mouse diplotene spermatocytes still contain linear sycp <dig> staining along the chromosomal axes at this stage. the xy pair could be easily detected in the majority of pachytene nuclei, due to the absence of sycp <dig> along most of the x chromosomal axis detected by sycp <dig> , but no distinct nuclear domain encompassing the xy body was observed in the dapi staining. the chromosomal axis of the y chromosome was very short, and frequently appeared to synapse almost completely with the x. in addition, large stretches of sycp <dig>  much longer than what might have been expected from xy synapsis, were sometimes observed . to study the dynamics of xy association during meiotic prophase in more detail, we first identified the different xy configurations, and their temporal appearance. to this end we made use of the fact that xy body formation is followed by a replacement of histone variants h <dig>  and h <dig>  by h <dig> , as has been described for the mouse  <cit> , allowing a distinction between early and mid-to-late pachytene spermatocytes. using a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes h <dig>  and h <dig> , we observed depletion of the h <dig> / <dig> antigens from at least part of the xy body from mid pachytene onwards . costaining with the marker of the central element tex <dig>  and the centromere marker crest, revealed that a short synapsed patch can be observed on the xy pair in early pachytene, before histone removal, that localizes near the y centromere , indicating synapsis between x and y. subsequently, when h <dig>  removal occurs in early-to-mid pachytene and mid pachytene spermatocytes, a longer stretch of tex <dig> staining is observed on the xy pair . this extensive synapsis is transient, and was usually observed in the area between the par and the x chromosome centromere . finally, in late pachytene, the tex <dig> signal becomes restricted again to the area close to the y centromere. at these final stages, the x-chromosomal axis stained by sycp <dig> becomes thickened . when we quantified the extent of self-synapsis along the x chromosome in  <dig> pachytene nuclei,  <dig> of these nuclei displayed no detectable xy synapsis ,  <dig> nuclei had little synapsis , extensive synapsis up to the x centromere was observed in  <dig> nuclei, and even more extreme synapsis, including part of the xq region, was detected in  <dig> nuclei. to understand if the extensive synapsis occurs between x and y or represents some form of x self-synapsis, we used structured illumination microscopy  which reaches a resolution of 120 nm  to 130 nm , on samples immunostained for sycp <dig> and sycp <dig> . this showed a short stretch of synapsis between x and y, encompassing approximately half of the y chromosomal axis, in early pachytene nuclei. at mid pachytene, additional synapsis was observed along two short stretches where part of the x chromosome forms a looped structure. thus, this configuration may represent heterologous self-synapsis of the x. in addition, some nuclei showed a split sycp <dig> signal along most of the x chromosome separated by a stretch of sycp <dig>  indicating that in these nuclei synapsis between sister chromatids of the x chromosome may occur. to verify whether these sycp <dig> stretches represented true synapsis, we also stained for tex <dig>  a component of the central element, and hormad <dig>  a marker of unsynapsed axes which is known to be removed upon synapsis in mouse spermatocytes  <cit> . figure 4b shows that indeed also in dog spermatocytes hormad <dig> signals are frequently reduced when tex <dig> is present. in addition, crest antibody was used to verify the locations of the x and y centromeres, and the immunostaining showed that the x centromere localizes at the tip of the loop that is formed and appears to display some form of heterologous synapsis.figure  <dig> extensive x chromosome self-synapsis in dog pachytene spermatocytes. overview of the dog male meiotic prophase and the progression of synapsis between the xy pair. the left

dna double strand break repair appears to be completed during maximal self-synapsis along the x chromosome axis
due to the largely heterologous state of the mouse x and y chromosomes, dsb repair on these sex chromosomes is delayed in regions outside the par . to visualize the dynamics of dsb formation and repair on the dog xy, we first analysed the presence of the homologous recombination repair protein rad <dig>  and the well-known marker of dsbs and the xy body, γh2ax  <cit>  . γh2ax represents the phosphorylated form of h2ax. this variant of h2a can be phosphorylated by the checkpoint kinases atr and atm or by dna-pkcs in somatic cells in response to dna damage  <cit> . during meiotic prophase in mouse, atm phosphorylates h2ax at meiotic dsbs  <cit> . later, atr is responsible for the formation of γh2ax on the xy body  <cit> .figure  <dig> dsbs repair dynamics. a) spermatocyte spread nuclei stained for γh2ax , rad <dig>  and sycp <dig> . single stainings are shown in gray scale. percentages indicate the fraction of pachytene nuclei observed as shown. zygotene nuclei were identified based on the fact that axes were split for more than one chromosome pair, and γh2ax and rad <dig> staining signals were extensive. pachytene nuclei were identified based on complete synapsis of the autosomes, and we discriminated between early-pachytene , mid-pachytene , and late-pachytene  spermatocytes. diplotene nuclei were characterized by desynapsis and thickening of the sycp <dig> ends. scale bar represents 10 μm. b) spermatocyte spread nuclei stained for γh2ax , rad <dig> , sycp <dig> , and sycp <dig> . close-ups show a magnification of the xy body, the top image shows sycp <dig> staining  in the area, for which the merge of sycp <dig>  rad <dig> and γh2ax is shown below.



at leptotene, we observed many rad <dig> foci, indicative of the presence of dsbs throughout the nucleus, in accordance with a previous report  <cit> . γh2ax displayed a focal staining pattern colocalising with the rad <dig> foci. the number of foci decreased during zygotene. in early pachytene nuclei ), only a few foci remained present on the synapsed axes of autosomes, whereas the x chromosome still carried many bright rad <dig> foci associated with intense γh2ax staining of the xy body chromatin . in mid pachytene nuclei , γh2ax still covered most of the xy axes, but rad <dig> foci had disappeared from the sex chromosomes. quadruple staining of rad <dig>  sycp <dig>  sycp <dig>  and γh2ax confirmed the notion that rad <dig> disappears before γh2ax, and also showed that rad <dig> has disappeared when maximal synapsis is reached . finally, neither rad <dig> foci nor γh2ax were observed on the xy body of late pachytene nuclei , and in none of the few diplotene nuclei that were found. in cells where both γh2ax and rad <dig> were absent from the xy body, the sycp <dig> axes of the xy pair usually had a thickened appearance, and these were defined as late pachytenes. we verified the absence of γh2ax from such late pachytene nuclei using immunofluorescent staining of dog testis sections. for the spermatogenic cycle of the dog,  <dig> different cellular associations have been described , with late pachytene and diplotene spermatocytes appearing at stages vi and vii. indeed, we observed a few γh2ax negative nuclei with one intense axis staining for sycp <dig> at stage vi, and more such nuclei were observed at stage vii .figure  <dig> loss of γh2ax from the xy body in pachytene spermatocytes becomes evident at stage vi of the spermatogenic cycle in the dog. a) schematic drawing of the different stages of the spermatogenic cycle of the dog . b) immunostaining of cryosections of dog testes for γh2ax  and sycp <dig> , and also stained with dapi . stages were identified based on russell et al.   <cit> . loss of γh2ax and the thickened sycp <dig> axes representative of late pachytene becomes evident at stage vi. single immunostainings are shown in grayscale. magnifications are shown in the bottom panels, and some cells and the xy body are outlined for reference.



markers of msci on the xy body of dog pachytene spermatocytes
in addition to being the earliest known marker of the mouse xy body, γh2ax is required for the initiation of msci in mouse spermatocytes  <cit> . the canine xy pair is highly enriched for γh2ax in early-to-mid pachytene, but loses this mark before exit from pachytene. we wondered if this early depletion of γh2ax from the xy body could be associated with premature release from msci. therefore, we investigated the localization pattern of additional markers of mammalian msci.

first, we analysed the presence of rna polymerase ii, using two different antibodies, one targeting all rna polymerase ii, and one that targets only the form that is phosphorylated at serine  <dig> in the heptapeptide repeats in the c-terminal domain  of the large subunit in association with transcription elongation . the overall level of rna polymerase ii was found to be quite low in dog pachytene nuclei, but nonetheless the xy pair frequently appeared depleted of rna polymerase ii as compared to the rest of the nucleus , indicating a lack of transcriptional activity. in accordance with this observation, we also observed reduced staining for phosphorylated rna polymerase ii in the region containing the xy body in the majority of pachytene nuclei  . however, surprisingly, this antibody showed an intense dotted signal adjacent to the sypc3-stained x-chromosomal axis also in a large fraction of the pachytene nuclei , indicating some ongoing rna transcription along specific regions of the x chromosome. loss of γh2ax from the xy body was not specifically associated with the appearance of the bright phosphorylated rna polymerase ii foci. furthermore, when foci were present, the overall level of phosphorylated rna polymerase ii at the xy body was variable . thus, at this point, we cannot explain what may cause, and what might be the consequences, of this focal transcriptional activity in the xy body of some pachytene nuclei. to provide additional evidence for overall transcriptional silencing of the xy body, at least in part of the pachytene nuclei, we performed an rna-fish experiment to detect nascent transcripts containing repeats. this method has also been used to verify msci and msuc in the mouse  <cit> . figure  <dig> indeed shows reduced hybridization of cot <dig> dna in the area of the chromatin that encompasses the xy body in comparison to the rest of the chromatin in two pachytene nuclei . however, the depletion of cot <dig> signal was not always evident . next, we analysed the localisation of two different histone modifications; h <dig> lysine  <dig> dimethylation , known to be associated with active or potentiated chromatin, and h <dig> lysine  <dig> trimethylation  as a marker of inactive chromatin. in mouse spermatocytes, both these modifications are enriched on the xy body in late prophase nuclei  and persist on the sex chromosomes in round spermatids  <cit> . methylation of h3k <dig> is thought to function to maintain repression of the sex chromosomes in post-meiotic cells, in the absence of γh2ax  <cit> . in contrast, the increase in h3k <dig> methylation in mouse diplotene spermatocytes may contribute to reactivation of a subgroup of x- or y-linked genes in round spermatids  <cit> . in dog spermatocytes, the overall level of h3k4me <dig> was low in pachytene nuclei. in parallel with depletion of h <dig>  from the xy body chromatin, depletion of h3k4me <dig> from xy body chromatin was observed. in diplotene nuclei and round spermatids, h3k4me <dig> remained excluded from the area of the nucleus that lacks h <dig> , which covers either the x or the y chromosome . we performed a similar analysis for h3k9me <dig>  and observed a general enrichment of this modification in the centromeric regions of all chromosomes including the xy pair. only in late pachytene, enrichment of h3k9me <dig> on the xy body appeared to spread a bit more, and included at least half of the xy body chromatin, but this enrichment was no longer observed at diplotene . in round spermatids, enrichment of h3k9me <dig> was highly variable in the area lacking h <dig> , and no specific correlation between lack of h <dig>  and increased h3k9me <dig> signal could be detected .figure  <dig> different patterns of rna polymerase ii localization on the xy body of dog pachytene spermatocytes. a) pachytene spermatocyte spread nuclei stained for γh2ax , rna polymerase ii , and sycp <dig> , single rna polymerase ii immunostainings are shown in gray scale. the lower panel represents a late pachytene spermatocyte in which γh2ax is already lost from part of the x chromosome and rnapolii is not clearly depleted from the xy body. b) pachytene spermatocyte spread nuclei stained for γh2ax , phosphorylated rna polymerase ii , and sycp <dig> , single rna polymerase ii immunostainings are shown in gray scale. the lower panel represents a late pachytene spermatocyte in which γh2ax is already lost from part of the x chromosome. rna polymerase ii depletion from the xy body is evident in the nucleus shown in the middle. in addition, foci of phosphorylated rna polymerase ii staining are specifically observed in the xy body of the middle and the bottom nucleus. b’ shows magnifications of the xy body regions shown in b. c) quantification of the percentages of pachytene nuclei  with rna polymerase ii foci in the xy body, relative to the overall depletion of this mark from the  the xy body, and to the enrichment of γh2ax in the xy body. nuclei were immunostained as shown in panel b.



mrna sequencing reveals msci and pscr in the dog
to directly compare x-chromosomal and autosomal rna expression levels in both spermatocytes and spermatids, we isolated total rna from cell preparations enriched in either spermatocytes  or spermatids  from testes of  <dig> dogs and performed rna sequencing analysis. after removal of genes for which mrna was absent in  <dig> or more samples we detected 91% of the genes presently annotated as coding genes in the dog genome . next, we generated boxplots of the gene expression  and observed that the expression levels for the x chromosome were significantly lower compared to autosomes both in spermatocytes  and spermatids , indicating that both msci and pscr impact on the activity of the dog x chromosome . to be able to compare the degree of msci and pscr between dog and mouse, we also generated similar boxplots for mouse spermatocytes and spermatids, using the recently published rna sequencing dataset, using purified spermatocyte and round spermatid cell fractions of similar purity to our samples   <cit>  . it was found that gene expression from the x compared to the autosomes was reduced more clearly in mouse spermatocytes . in addition, although pscr was apparent , a significant overall post-meiotic upregulation of x-linked gene expression was observed in mouse , but not in dog spermatids. for the human, only results from microarray analyses are available  <cit> , and we generated boxplots of these datasets. the results indicate that x-linked gene expression in human spermatogenesis follows a pattern with measurable msci , but x-linked gene expression in round spermatids was even higher than autosomal expression  .figure  <dig> gene expression in mouse, dog, and human spermatocytes and round spermatids. a) left and middle: boxplots showing median,  <dig>  and  <dig> percentile log <dig> values of the mrna levels of genes on chromosomes  <dig> , and x in dog and mouse  spermatocytes  and round spermatids . genes that were expressed below the  <dig> percentile values of the whole genome average in both spermatocytes and spermatids were excluded from this analysis. right: boxplot showing median,  <dig>  and  <dig> percentile values of the mrna levels represented as log <dig>  the values were obtained from published microarray hybridization data using mrna isolated from human spermatocytes and spermatids  <cit> , and shown here for chromosomes  <dig> , and x. genes with very low expression  in both spermatocytes and spermatids were excluded from this analysis. asterisks indicate significant difference in gene expression between autosomes and the x chromosome for spermatocytes and spermatids. plus indicates significantly higher x-linked than autosomal gene expression in spermatids. horizontal red lines indicate significant difference in x-linked gene expression between spermatocytes and spermatids. b) differentially expressed genes along chromosome  <dig> and chromosome x, comparing expression in spermatocytes and round spermatids from the dog. genes that are significantly up-regulated in round spermatids compared to spermatocytes  are indicated as + <dig> bars, and significantly down-regulated genes are represented as − <dig> bars along chromosome x and chromosome  <dig>  in addition, the log <dig> values of all genes along the chromosomes in spermatocytes and round spermatids are shown. gene density along the chromosomes can be inferred from the density of the bar representing locations of ensembl annotated genes along the chromosome shown at the bottom. for the x chromosome, the approximate location of the par border is indicated by a light blue line, and centromere location is indicated by a dashed gray line.



reactivation of single copy x-linked genes in dog round spermatids, but also post-meiotic downregulation of a subset of x-linked genes
next we identified differentially expressed genes between spermatocytes and spermatids using two different approaches  and edger ). both approaches yielded highly comparable sets of genes , and a more detailed investigation was performed using the cufflinks analysis results. for x-linked genes with a more than  <dig>  fold change in gene expression, we observed that  <dig> genes were significantly up-regulated in spermatids compared to spermatocytes, while  <dig> were down-regulated . previously, we have shown that a large group of single-copy genes can escape from pscr in mouse spermatids  <cit> , contrary to the hypothesis that post-meiotic expression of x-linked genes would require multiple copies of a gene to overcome the repressive marks  <cit> . of the up-regulated genes in dog round spermatids, the only known multi-copy genes we could identify that were differentially expressed from the x chromosome were members of the magea and mageb gene families, that are also multi-copy in mouse and man. however, the majority of these genes was down-regulated in spermatids compared to spermatocytes. in addition,  <dig> differentially expressed dog x-linked genes are homologous to multi-copy x-linked genes identified in mouse and human by mueller et al.  <cit> , but very few of these genes are clearly multi-copy  in dog, and  <dig> are down-regulated in spermatids compared to spermatocytes .table  <dig>

next we compared the above-mentioned rna sequencing data recently deposited for mouse spermatocytes and spermatids  <cit> , to our dog dataset. significantly differentially expressed genes were identified using the same method for both species . from this, it is clear that there are more x-linked genes that become up-regulated in spermatids in mouse compared to dog. conversely, fewer x-linked genes are specifically post-meiotically down-regulated in mouse compared to dog. almost half of the x-linked genes that are up-regulated in spermatids in the dog share this expression pattern with the mouse. in contrast, less than 10% of the down-regulated genes are shared between mouse and dog.

differential regulation of gene expression along the p and q arms of the dog x chromosome
to study whether certain regions of the dog x chromosome  are more likely to be up- or down-regulated in round spermatids we plotted the density of differentially expressed genes and their corresponding expression level  along the x chromosome and chromosome  <dig>  . for the x chromosome, a higher number of up-regulated genes appears to be located on the p arm  as compared to the q arm. reciprocally, the q arm of the x chromosome contains a relatively high number of down-regulated genes. for chromosome  <dig>  some areas are also more enriched for either up- or down-regulated genes, but here it appears to correlate better with gene density and the overall gene expression activity in those areas. a similar pattern to that found for chromosome  <dig> was observed for chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> .

to further investigate whether changes in gene expression between spermatids and spermatocytes vary along the x chromosome, we plotted the walking average of gene expression along chromosomes x and  <dig>  the expression pattern of genes along chromosome  <dig> is not globally different between spermatocytes and spermatids . in contrast, the expression of genes along the x chromosome is globally up-regulated in spermatids compared to spermatocytes . however, we observed variability in the degree of upregulation depending on the position of genes on the chromosome. upregulation is much more pronounced along the p arm of the x chromosome, compared to the q arm . we then looked at the expression level of genes along the x chromosome in mouse, and observed a much more clear upregulation in round spermatids, compared to what we observed for the dog . along chromosome  <dig>  the patterns of gene expression were similar in mouse and dog. to visualize the differential regulation of the p and q arms of the x chromosome in the dog more clearly, we generated separate boxplots of gene expression from the two arms in spermatocytes and round spermatids, and compared the outcome to boxplots obtained for autosomes of the dog . all dog and mouse autosomes, and also the mouse x chromosome, are acrocentric. therefore, in this evaluation we introduced an arbitrary split of left  and right  parts of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and x. as expected, we observed that expression from the dog p and q arm of the x is significantly reduced compared to the split autosomes in spermatocytes  . however, the expression from the p-arm was higher than the expression from the q arm . more importantly, in round spermatids, the gene expression from the p arm of the dog x even reaches a level that is not different from autosomal gene expression, whereas the q arm remains repressed  . in the mouse, no differences in gene expression between the arbitrarily split arms of the chromosomes, including the x, were observed . in accordance with the results presented in figure  <dig>  partial reactivation is observed for both  parts of the x chromosome.figure  <dig> partial conservation of msci and pscr among mouse, dog, and man. a) walking average of gene expression along chromosome  <dig> in spermatocytes and round spermatids from dog and mouse. b) walking average of gene expression along chromosome x in spermatocytes and round spermatids from dog and mouse. pars are indicated in blue. centromere positions are shown in dashed gray boxes. c) boxplot showing median,  <dig>  and  <dig> percentile of gene expression in the p arm  and q arm  of the dog x in spermatocytes and round spermatids compared to boxplots of arbitrarily split autosomes of dog and mouse x chromosomes and autosomes. asterisks indicate significant difference in gene expression between split autosomes and the x chromosome arms. plus indicates significant difference between split autosomes and the q arm of the x only. horizontal red lines indicate significant difference in x-linked gene expression between chromosome arms. d) venn diagram showing the number of commonly up-regulated  and down-regulated  x-linked genes in round spermatids compared to spermatocytes in dog, mouse and human. genes commonly up-regulated or down-regulated in all three species are listed in bold. down-regulated genes common only to dog and human, not to mouse, are listed with regular characters. borders of the areas including listed genes are marked in blue.

the dog has an exceptionally large par containing  <dig> annotated genes  <cit> , and it was expected that this region would escape from msci because it is capable to fully engage in homologous synapsis and meiotic recombination. however, we found a relatively low average level of mrna expression in this region  in both spermatocytes and spermatids. the value is more than 10-fold lower than the overall genome average, and also more than two-fold lower than the average of the whole x chromosome in spermatocytes. thus, it appears that the dog par is even more repressed in spermatocytes compared to the rest of the x chromosome, and shows very little re-expression in spermatids. interestingly, one gene, named slc25a <dig> , was found to be highly expressed in dog spermatocytes , and thus appears to escape from msci. we cannot formally exclude that the mrna molecules that are detected in extracts from the purified spermatocytes were produced in spermatogonia or early spermatocytes, but there are several arguments that indicate that this is highly unlikely. first, the fpkm of  <dig>  lies well above the genome average of  <dig>  in dog spermatocytes. second, global gene transcription is very low in leptotene and zygotene spermatocytes  <cit> , and since duration of the pachytene stage is around 13 days in the dog  <cit> , slc25a <dig> mrna would have to be extremely stable to remain present in the population of purified spermatocytes at such a high level. in es cells, the median half life of mrnas is  <dig>  h  <cit> , and although regulation of mrna stability will differ between different cell types, we feel that active transcription of slca25a <dig> in dog pachytene spermatocytes most likely accounts for the high fpkm value that we measured for this mrna. slc25a <dig> encodes an adenine nucleotide carrier , an adp/atp carrier that transports adp into mitochondria and atp out of mitochondria. slc25a <dig> is a member of a family of four proteins that also includes slc25a <dig> , slc25a <dig>  and slc25a <dig> . of these, only the gene encoding slc25a <dig> is also x-linked. the expression levels of these genes in spermatocytes and spermatids of mouse, dog and man are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  it is clear that both the autosomal slc25a <dig> gene and the x-linked slc25a <dig> gene are the main ancp variants that are expressed in spermatocytes in dog. slc25a <dig> has not been conserved in the mouse genome, and the autosomal slc25a <dig> variant is highly expressed in spermatocytes. in human spermatocytes, slc25a <dig> is also the main expressed gene, and the two x-linked variants slc25a <dig> and slc25a <dig> are expressed at levels comparable to the median for expressed genes calculated for the genome in both spermatocytes and round spermatids, indicating that they may be transcribed and escape msci.

pathway analysis of x-linked genes with common post-meiotic regulation between mouse, dog and man
to investigate if genes that are up-regulated in spermatids in both mouse and dog belong to a conserved pathway that is essential during this stage, a pathway analysis was performed using the  <dig> commonly up-regulated genes in spermatids. the top  <dig> of significantly enriched molecular and cellular functions are: cell morphology; dna replication, recombination, and repair; cell signaling; post-translational; and protein synthesis . finally, we compared the x-linked up- and down-regulated genes between dog, mouse, and human , and identified  <dig> genes that are up-regulated in spermatids of all three species . for  <dig> of these genes, mouse knockout models have been described; two are embryonic-lethal, precluding direct analyses of the function of the gene in spermatogenesis, three displayed no clear reproductive defect, and three models displayed defects in post-meiotic spermatid differentiation. for the x-linked genes that were expressed at lower levels in spermatids compared to spermatocytes, very few were conserved between two species, and only two were common to mouse, dog, and man  .

discussion
here, we performed a detailed analysis of the dynamics of xy chromosome pairing during meiotic prophase in dog, in relation to the progression of meiotic dsb repair, and regulation of gene expression.

the dog x chromosome has two special characteristics that make this analysis particularly relevant. first, it displays transient but extensive self-synapsis during pachytene, as revealed by our immunocytochemical analyses, and second it has an exceptionally long par, as compared to mouse and human. we studied both these properties in relation to the dynamics of meiotic dsb repair and the msci and pscr processes.

transient self-synapsis correlates with progression of hr repair on the x chromosome and loss of γh2ax
in general, lack of synapsis is associated with persistence of markers of dsb repair  <cit> . for the mouse xy pair, this might be attributed to the lack of homology between x and y, in combination with the effect of an interhomolog bias, which would inhibit use of the sister chromatid as a template for hr repair. the accomplishment of extensive heterologous synapsis along the dog x during a brief period in mid pachytene was associated with concomitant loss of markers of ongoing dsb repair. loss of γh2ax occurred first in the area that included both the par and the self-synapsed regions, occurring either heterologous in looped regions of the x chromosome, or between sister chromatids, indicating that hr repair may occur faster in this area compared to the rest of the x chromosome. this finding also nicely correlates with the fact that we observed loss of hormad association with the self-synapsed regions, and hormad activity has been clearly linked to atr activation and subsequent γh2ax formation in the mouse  <cit> . the fact that all γh2ax enrichment on the x is lost prior to the end of pachytene may also indicate that meiotic hr repair on the x is complete before the end of pachytene, and thus may occur overall more rapidly in dog compared to mouse. although meiotic hr repair is thought to preferentially involve the use of an intact repair template from the homologous chromosome, this is not possible for sex chromosomal regions outside the par. in the mouse, it has been suggested that some dsbs might be repaired by non-homologous end-joining at the end of meiotic prophase, when components of this machinery are re-expressed  <cit> . however, it is perhaps more likely that the sister chromatid is eventually used as a repair template on the sex chromosomes, because the dsb ends have been resected, and this may channel repair towards homologous recombination. in addition, intrachromosomal nonallelic hr  may also occur  <cit> . in this pathway, recombination occurs between repeat sequences with a high sequence homology  on the same chromosome. this might have deleterious consequences such as inversions or deletions, but if repair is channelled towards a noncrossover pathway, such as synthesis-dependent strand annealing, overall chromosome structure can be retained  <cit> . meiotic nahr has not yet been explored for the dog sex chromosomes. for the human x and y chromosomes, intrachromosomal nahr has been reported as a cause of chromosomal aberrations associated with intellectual disability  <cit>  and male infertility  <cit> , respectively. from this, it might be suggested that, at least in the human, intrachromosomal nahr without genomic rearrangements could also occur during meiotic prophase, and function as a normal pathway to repair  dsbs along the unsynapsed axes of x and y.

msci occurs in dog spermatocytes, but may be incomplete or transient in some regions
persistence of meiotic dsbs and asynapsis are detected by the machinery that induces msci in the mouse  <cit> . we observed transient extensive self-synapsis of the x and associated loss of γh2ax from synapsed regions in dog pachytene spermatocytes. in addition, although h3k4me <dig> remains depleted from the x and y chromosomes in diplotene nuclei, h3k9me <dig> enrichment on the sex chromosomes was only transiently observed, and not clearly observed in late spermatocytes and post-meiotic cells. also, in late pachytene and diplotene spermatocytes, rnapolii depletion was less clear compared to the earlier pachytene nuclei, and phosphorylated rna polymerase was highly enriched in a focal manner along selected regions of the x chromosome in subfraction of the pachytene nuclei, apparently independent of synapsis. this contrasts with what has been observed in mouse, where the depletion of rnapolii on the xy body compared to autosomes is most evident in late pachytene and diplotene, mainly because overall transcription on autosomes increases  <cit> . based on these observations, we investigated if msci and/or pscr might be incomplete, or transient in the dog, using a whole genome approach.

using rna sequencing, we observed that msci occurs also in the dog. when we analysed global regulation of gene expression along the dog x chromosome in spermatocytes and round spermatids, we observed that msci is less clearly established along the p arm of the x chromosome, compared to the q arm. in addition, the overall level of gene expression derived from the p arm of the x chromosome was similar to that of autosomal genes in round spermatids, whereas for the q arm post-meiotic reactivation of the x-linked genes was limited or even absent. it is interesting to note that the x self-synapsis is most frequently observed along the p arm of the x chromosome, and synapsis of the tip of the q arm was almost never observed. thus, it might be suggested that the  synapsis facilitates not only dsb repair, but also helps to activate gene expression on the x chromosome. still, there are also regions in the q arm of the x chromosome that appear to have a relatively high expression level in both spermatocytes and round spermatids. intriguingly, the very region for which we would expect a clear correlation between synapsis and lack of msci, the par, was expressed at very low levels in both spermatocytes and spermatids. we expected that the par would behave like autosomes regarding repair and synapsis, and escape from msci, but it appears to be subject to its own unknown specific regulatory control mechanism. thus, although there is some degree of correlation between x self-synapsis and reduced msci, other, yet unknown aspects of sex chromosome regulation may differ between dog and mouse, and influence msci.

msci escapees
little is known about x-linked genes that may escape from msci in mouse, except for a report on escape of mirna genes and the noncoding tsx transcript in spermatocytes  <cit> .

since msci is less complete in dog , it might be expected that true escapees of msci could exist in these species. in dog,  <dig> of the x-linked genes that are more than  <dig> -fold down-regulated in spermatids have an fpkm value > <dig> in spermatocytes, which is higher than the median fpkm value of all genes that were analysed in spermatocytes, and thus indicates ongoing transcription.

x-linked genes that are specifically expressed in spermatocytes and become down-regulated in spermatids in more than one species are expected to possibly exert a relevant function during meiosis. mouse and dog have  <dig> common x-linked genes that are expressed at a level more than  <dig> -fold lower in spermatids compared to spermatocytes. two of these, atp6ap1/atp6ap <dig> and pgrmc1/pgrmc <dig> are also more than  <dig>  fold down-regulated in human spermatids, based on the microarray data. nothing is known about the putative expression or role of these proteins in spermatocytes.

interestingly, of the  <dig> x-linked genes that are down-regulated both in dog and human round spermatids,  <dig> have been shown to be expressed in human spermatocytes and thus may represent true escapees of msci: fmr1nb, ctag1a  <cit> , magea  <cit> , rhoxf <dig>  <cit> , and tktl <dig>  <cit> . out of these, fmr1nb, ctag1a and magea9b are cancer/testis antigens. rhoxf <dig> is a homeobox protein and tktl <dig> is a transketolase involved in the pentose-phosphate pathway. these  <dig> genes are thus of special interest as candidate x-linked genes that may perform an important function during meiotic prophase in human spermatogenesis. for the other three genes, formal proof of msci escape may be obtained when their mrna expression levels in purified spermatogonia can be directly compared to their mrna levels in purified spermatocytes.

the gene encoding the adp/atp carrier slc25a <dig> is another interesting putative msci-escapee, and localizes to the par in dog and man. anc proteins are of vital importance for the metabolism of the cell, and pachytene spermatocytes likely require a high rate of atp synthesis  <cit> .

pscr may not reflect an active repressive process
from our whole genome analysis of mrna expression in dog spermatocytes and spermatids, it is clear that most x-linked genes that are significantly up-regulated in spermatids compared to spermatocytes are single-copy genes. we propose that persistence of the inactivation of x-linked genes in dog and perhaps human spermatids is not primarily due to a post-meiotic repressive mechanism operating during this stage, but rather represents a carry-over of msci. this is supported by the observed lack of accumulation of h3k9me <dig>  as well as by the absence of a dapi dense area on the sex chromosomes in spermatids, one of the markers of pscr in mouse. this new extensive analysis of msci and pscr in the dog again supports the notion that x-linked gene activation occurs frequently for single-copy genes in spermatids, and is not globally inhibited. it should also be considered that expression of x-linked genes in spermatids will not only require alleviation of msci but also more specific post-meiotic transcriptional regulation.

identification of putative x-linked male fertility genes
the pathway analysis of x-linked genes that are significantly up-regulated in spermatids both in mouse and dog, revealed that most of these genes are involved in shaping the sperm cell and maintaining genome integrity. these are important processes that require activation of a specific subset of x-linked genes. in addition, it is worth mentioning that a relatively high number of reactivated genes are involved in the regulation of posttranslational modifications and of protein synthesis and degradation . the addition of the dog as a new species to the dataset of gene expression in spermatocytes and spermatids allows identification of x-linked genes that show post-meiotic induction of gene expression in mouse, human and dog, thus providing more evidence for an important function in spermatogenesis. for some of these genes, knockout mice have been generated. several of these mutant animals were shown to be fertile, indicating that even conserved expression does not necessarily indicate that the gene is absolutely required for fertility, at least in the mouse. it should be kept in mind that spermatogenesis is much more efficient in mouse compared to man, yielding a much higher number of mature spermatozoa per gram testis weight per time unit, and a small selective advantage of expression of an x-linked gene in mouse spermatids may translate into an essential function in man. therefore, all genes listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  as well as the conserved possible msci escapees described above should be considered candidate human fertility genes.

CONCLUSIONS
our results provide novel insights in the regulation and significance of sex chromosome gene expression during spermatogenesis in mammals. we show that transient but extensive heterologous self-synapsis of the x chromosome is associated with rapid dsb repair and reduced msci. on the other hand, the genes that are localized in the pseudoautosomal region are mostly transcriptionally inactive in both spermatocytes and spermatids, despite the normal progression of synapsis in this region. we hypothesize that the par is controlled by its own specific regulatory mechanism but that specific genes in this region that exert a meiotic or post-meiotic function can be active. furthermore, based on conserved expression patterns in mouse, human, and dog spermatocytes and/or spermatids, we identified genes that may function in spermatocytes  or round spermatids , and should be considered as potential x-linked male fertility factors.
