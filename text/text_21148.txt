BACKGROUND
the microbial community inhabiting the human gastrointestinal tract  can be seen as an additional organ within the body able to produce key factors and bring about specific metabolic pathways within the human body  <cit> . overall, the structure and composition of this ecosystem reflects a natural selection at both microbial and host levels in order to develop cooperation aimed at functional stability  <cit> . this interaction mainly occurs at the interface of the mucus and epithelial cell barrier and may influence the regulation of host’s immune and hormonal systems  <cit> .

this close cross-talk is a complex area of study due to the limited accessibility of the human git and the intrinsic limitations in recreating in vitro conditions relevant for an in vivo-like interaction  <cit> . in the last two decades, the need for systems that closely mimic the in vivo situation led to the creation of dynamic in vitro simulators in an attempt to reproduce the physiological parameters of the git environment that influence the gi microbial community and its metabolic activity  <cit> . both the european food safety authority  and the us food and drug administration  support, as a complementary tool, the use of the in vitro approach in order to provide evidence of the mechanisms by which a food/constituent could exert the claimed effect, and of the biological plausibility of the specific claim . the most intensively used gut simulators include the three-stage continuous culture system, the shime® , the enteromix, the lacroix model and the tim- <dig> device  <cit> . although these systems offer a good reproducibility in terms of analysis of the luminal microbial community  <cit> , other aspects, such as adhesion of bacteria and host-microbiota interaction are not systematically addressed  <cit> . adhesion can be evaluated by means of cell immobilization in anaerobic continuous-flow cultures  <cit> ; by encasing mucin beads within a dialysis membrane  <cit> ; by introducing sterile porcine mucin gels in small glass tubes  <cit>  or on plastic carriers   <cit>  to determine how intestinal bacteria colonize and degrade mucus. the evaluation of the host’s response is normally conducted by means of cell culture experiments in plates  <cit> , in a trans-well setup  <cit> , by the three-dimensional organotypic model of human colonic epithelium  <cit>  or using the so-called human gut-on-a-chip  <cit> . independently of the used approach, the combination of cell lines with complex microbial communities  is limited by the fact that bacteria are highly cytotoxic for the cells, thus limiting the experimental time to a few hours  <cit> . finally, none of the available devices offers the opportunity of studying the gut biofilm formation and, at the same time, the host-microbiota interaction under continuous simulated conditions.

to overcome these limitations, we propose the use of the host microbiota interaction  module, taking into account the particular characteristics of the host-microbiota interface in the git. more specifically, the aim was to establish a model that allows long-term studies of a complex microbial community colonizing a mucus layer, while being co-cultured - up to 48 h - microaerophilically in the presence of shear forces and a monolayer of enterocyte human cells. we first characterized a number of technical parameters of the hmi module, and then we used the novel device together with the shime® to evaluate the possibility of using the hmi module for long-term studies of host-bacteria interactions. the shime® consists of a succession of five reactors simulating both the upper and the lower digestive tract, with the first two reactors, mimicking the stomach and small intestine, and the last three compartments simulating physiological and microbiological parameters representative of ascending, transverse and distal colon. we used, as a test compound, a dried product derived from saccharomyces cerevisiae’s fermentation that has already been shown to have immune modulating/anti-inflammatory properties both in vitro and in human clinical trials  <cit> . we followed the effect of the treatment on the composition of the luminal and mucosa-associated microbial community and on the simulated host’s response in terms of interleukin- <dig> production .

RESULTS
the gut microbiome is an additional organ within our body. to manage this complex community involved in key functionalities for human health, it is important to understand how bacteria interact with the host. this is not always easy due to limited in vivo accessibility of the git, particularly of the mucosal environment. in this study, we introduced a new methodology to study the host-microbe interaction under controlled in vitro conditions.

the hmi module
a new in vitro model, i.e. hmi module, was developed to study the indirect host-microbe interaction in the gastrointestinal tract. it comprises two parallel setups in order to perform experiments in duplicate, with each setup consisting of two compartments separated by a functional double-layer . the upper compartment simulates the luminal side of the git , whereas the lower compartment contains enterocytes, simulating the host. further, the functional double layer is composed of an upper mucus layer and a lower semi-permeable polyamide membrane and has been conceived to potentially serve multiple objectives: i) to provide a mucosal area which can be colonized by the gut bacteria; ii) to allow the bilateral transport of low molecular weight metabolites; iii) to allow the transport of oxygen from the lower to the upper side of the mucosal layer in order to create microaerophilic conditions at the bottom of the growing biofilm; and iv) to protect the host’s cells from direct exposure to a complex microbial community and its toxic effects. in this study the hmi module has been used in i) short-term experiments to characterize different technical parameters and ii) in a long-term experiment, coupled to a shime system , to assess the possibility to follow up the host’s response to a specific treatment up to 48 h.

characterization of the technical parameters 
in the first part of the work the newly developed model has been characterized with respect to a number of technological parameters in order to validate it with in vivo data. for these experiments the hmi module has been used as a separate unit .

the optimal shape of the hmi module was designed to provide a homogeneous fluid shear distribution on the surface of the mucus layer under different shear forces relevant for the git . analysis by confocal laser scanning microscopy  of the mucus layer on a vertical section and the evaluation of the mucus thickness showed that 95%  of the original mucus layer  was still present after 5 hours at medium shear stress  and 45% after high shear stress  . shear forces in the gut are a key factor in shaping the adhering community, in affecting bacterial gene expression and physiology, and can alternatively favor or disfavor the adhesion of specific strains  <cit> . physiological levels of shear stress found in the intestinal epithelium during peristalsis may range between  <dig> and  <dig>  dynes/cm <dig> <cit> . we chose values below  <dig> dynes/cm <dig> as these are representative for the final part of the ileum and beginning of the proximal colon. in fact, in absence of microvilli, the fluid shear stress would vary from about  <dig> to  <dig> dynes/cm <dig> <cit> .

once the shape of the model and the flow were established, we assessed the capacity of metabolites and oxygen to permeate through the double functional layer of the hmi module. a water solution containing fitc dextran was flown in the upper compartment and samples were collected from the lower compartment to measure the fraction of fluorescent product that could permeate through the double functional layer. the experiment was conducted without and with a 200 μm mucus layer on the membrane. the permeability coefficients ranged from  <dig>  × 10−6 cm sec− <dig> for the 4 kda dextran to  <dig>  × 10−9 cm sec− <dig> for the 150 kda dextran , demonstrating an inverse relationship between the size of the metabolite and the degree of permeation. when comparing modules with and without mucus layer, the presence of mucus further induced a decrease in the permeability of the test product , as also shown by desai et al.  <cit> . the obtained values are in the same range of other studies conducted with caco- <dig> cells  <cit> , perfused animals  <cit>  or ex-vivo human colon tissues  <cit> . behrens et al.  <cit>  reported that undifferentiated ht- <dig> cells have a high permeability for 4 kda dextrin  which decreases with increasing thickness of mucus to  <dig> × 10−6 cm sec− <dig>  a similar setup was used to assess the oxygen permeation through the double functional layer . in this case o2-saturated water  was added in the lower compartment while deoxygenized water was added in the upper compartment. the oxygen concentration was then measured in the upper compartment: an oxygen permeability  of  <dig>  × 10−4 cm sec− <dig> resulted in a diffusion coefficient  of  <dig>  × 10−6 cm2 sec− <dig>  the pmo <dig> value obtained with the hmi module was in line with the ex vivo theoretical permeability diffusion calculated by saldena and colleagues  <cit>  for a mucus layer of 115 μm .

characterization of the biological parameters
a final set of short-term experiments was conducted to assess the capability of bacteria to colonize the mucus layer  and to evaluate the survival of the enterocytes in the lower compartment when exposed to a complex microbiota.

in the first setup, a pure culture of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg  was flown in the upper compartment. lgg was chosen as a positive control, because human in vivo studies showed that the beneficial effects of lgg are, in part, attributed to a strong colonization of the colonic mucus layer upon oral administration  <cit> . this strong adhesion capacity of lgg has recently been attributed to a spac pilin, which is located on the top of the pili and exerts a strong mucus-binding activity  <cit> . after  <dig>  h of incubation in the upper compartment of the hmi module, lgg showed an adhesion percentage of  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, as compared to the original concentration dosed to the model. this value is in line with what described by van den abbeele et al.  <cit> , who tested the adhesive properties of lgg in presence of a complex gut microbiota in a m-shime. the colonization capacity of mucus by lgg was thus confirmed in the hmi module.

finally, the hmi module containing enterocytes in the lower compartment was challenged for the first time with a complex microbiota originated from the simulated ascending colon of the shime. in parallel the enterocytes were also directly exposed to the same complex microbiota. a mtt test showed that the viability of caco- <dig> cells directly exposed to the complex microbial community decreased by 80% after 2 hours of co-culture. in contrast, when the interaction occurred within an hmi module, the cells’ viability after 48 h of incubation was not significantly different as compared to a control system in which only sterile shime medium was dosed . although the use of cell cultures, such as caco- <dig> cells, is not novel for mechanistic studies  <cit> , the output of these reductionist studies is limited by the fact that they are normally conducted using pure bacterial cultures, a mix of few bacterial strains or filtered growth media. this is mainly related to the fact that mixed microbial slurries are too cytotoxic , thus limiting the experimental time  and the adaptation of the host to the microbial metabolism. on the contrary, the hmi module allows to indirectly expose the caco- <dig> cells to the gut microbiota for up to 48 h, the average in vivo exposure time of an enterocyte to the content of the gut lumen when migrating from the crypts to the top of the villi  <cit> .

long-term experiment
after the validation of the technical/biological parameters in independent experiments, the hmi module was used in combination with an adapted shime  to test the effect of a dried, modified saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product . the adapted shime consisted of a succession of three reactors: the first two reactors are of the fill-and-draw principle to simulate different steps in food uptake and digestion by simulating, respectively, stomach and small intestine; the last compartment, simulating the ascending colon , was a continuously stirred reactor with constant volume, ph control and inoculation with fecal microbiota. as described in more detail in the ‘methods’ section, two hmi modules were connected to the ac vessel of the shime during the last three days of the control and of the treatment week .

considering the average of three sampling points in the shime experiment , the treatment with the dried-fermented yeast product induced a 35% increase in total short chain fatty acids  production in the lumen of the simulated ac  with a 41% increase of acetate , a 6% increase of propionate  and a 31% increase of butyrate  .

quantitative pcr data at luminal level in the ac showed that at the moment of connecting the hmi module to the shime during the treatment period, the concentration of all the analysed microbial groups was lower as compared to the respective time point during the control period. despite this, at the end of the 48 h-treatment period, the bacteria concentration of all groups were equal or higher than the respective sampling points during the control period . at mucosal level, all microbial groups at the end of the treatment showed a lower concentration with the exception of the lactobacillus spp. which, at 48 h, was  <dig> log higher as compared to the same time point during the control period.

data for l are expressed as 16s rrna gene copies/ml of shime suspension; those for m correspond to 16s rrna gene copies cm− <dig> of simulated gut wall. values in bold indicate samples from the treatment period which are significantly higher than the control at the same sampling time, according to a student’s two-tailed t test . values in italics are significantly lower.

the cluster analysis based on a composite data set of the dgge gels for total bacteria , bifidobacteria  and lactobacilli  is shown in figure 5c. the samples from control and treatment period clustered separately . moreover, within each cluster, luminal samples and mucosal samples sub-clustered in two different groups . the dgge specific for bifidobacteria  showed that two distinct bifidobacterium spp. – indicated by an arrow and a black square could benefit from the treatment and specifically colonize the mucus layer. the bifidobacterium sp. identified by the black square was only dominant in the microbial biofilm during the week of treatment. also for lactobacilli, the dgge showed qualitative changes due to the treatment . the lactobacillus sp. indicated by the black arrow, initially present both in the luminal and the mucosal microbial community, were lost during the treatment. on the contrary, the treatment selectively enhanced those species within the dashed square, species that preferentially adhere to the simulated gut surface. these molecular data showed that by means of an hmi module connected to the shime, it was possible to evaluate the modulating effect of the test product both on the luminal and mucosa-associated microbiota. the latter was different from the luminal one  as the mucin layer is colonized by a biofilm with bacterial species that specifically  adhere to mucins,  metabolize mucins or  proliferate in mucus due to the microaerophilic conditions at the bottom of this layer. this is also the case in vivo, where it was shown for instance that the mucosa-associated microbiota differs from the dominant fecal microbiota in both healthy subjects and patients with ibd  <cit> .

finally, the positioning of two specific microbial groups  in the mucus layer as analysed by fish, provided an additional proof of the validity of the hmi module as compared to the in vivo situation . while the strict anaerobic bifidobacteria tended to colonize the upper side of the mucus layer, f. prausnitzii mainly occurred in the lower part of the mucus, i.e. at the anoxic/oxic interphase . khan et al. demonstrated that f. prausnitzii can grow in the oxic-anoxic interphase due to the fact that this microorganism, despite being oxygen sensitive, copes with o <dig> because of a special extracellular electron shuttle of flavins and thiols  <cit> . similar to the in vivo situation - where small amounts of oxygen permeate from blood vessels towards the gut lumen - in the hmi module, oxygen diffusion from the aerobic lower chamber to the anaerobic upper chamber  probably results in microaerophilic conditions at the base of the biofilm, allowing for f. prausnitzii to specifically colonize this niche. the qpcr data showed a decreasing concentration of f. prausnitzii in the luminal compartment and an increasing one in the mucus layer along the 48 h experiment . the concentration of bifidobacteria remained unaffected in the luminal part while tended to decrease in the mucus layer compartment. the fish data thus demonstrate the potency of the hmi module to preserve the regional colonization of specific gut microorganisms within the mucus layer.

finally, the possibility of exposing the enterocytes to complex microbial communities for a prolonged period allowed us to follow up the response of the host-like cells to the specific treatment. figure 7b shows that, after 24 h and 48 h, the morphology of the caco- <dig> cells during and at the end of the treatment period was comparable with that of the cells at the beginning of the experiment. moreover, the cells remained attached as a monolayer to the collagen substrate and were viable . the samples collected from the lower chamber when the medium was replaced every 6 h  were used to assess the residual concentration of o <dig> and the production of il- <dig> by caco- <dig> cells. the dissolved o <dig> in the fresh cell medium was  <dig>  mg l− <dig>  this concentration decreased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg l− <dig> in the ‘6 h-sample’ at 6 h, to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg l− <dig> in the ‘6 h-sample’ at 24 h and to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg l− <dig> in the ‘6 h-sample’ at 48 h. this indicates that the o <dig> concentrations did not decrease dramatically in the lower compartment over time. the treatment with the yeast fermentate resulted in an anti-inflammatory response as evidenced by significant lower il- <dig> production after 48 h , as compared to the control . the significant decrease in pro-inflammatory il- <dig> production has already been correlated with a scfa profile that shifted towards an increased production of butyrate  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the study of the in vivo functionality of adhering bacterial communities in the human git and of the localized effect on the host is frequently hindered by the complexity of reaching particular areas of the git, and by the lack of suitable in vitro models simulating the actual git complexity. in order to overcome this limitation we proposed the hmi module as a simplified simulation of the processes occurring at the level of the gut wall . three unique advantages can be ascribed to this new device, as compared to other systems available for research purposes: i) the possibility to simulate at once the bacterial adhesion to the gut wall and the indirect effect on human cell lines; ii) the possibility of performing these studies up to 48 h with a complex microbiota, representative of that inhabiting the human gut; iii) the possibility to couple the hmi module to a continuous simulator of the human gastrointestinal tract . the latter is of key importance when analyzing the effect of specific products, as for instance prebiotic fibers. in fact, the health-modulating effect of fibers is often related to the metabolites produced by microbial species by means of cross-feeding  <cit> . for instance, primary users often degrade part of an ingredient to smaller fragments, sugar monomers, and scfa such as acetate or lactate. the latter two are precursors for the production of the anti-inflammatory scfa butyrate by other species  <cit> . the efficiency of this mechanism is frequently related to the adaptation of the microbial metabolic functionalities to the fiber and, in order to exert this effect, repeated doses of the ingredient are needed  <cit> . this is exactly what the combination ‘shime-hmi module’ allows to study: repeated doses of a product are provided to the microbiota of the shime; the product modifies the composition and activity of the luminal and mucosal microbiota and, ultimately, this modulates the host’s response.

several opportunities lay in the future to improve the host compartment of the hmi module. among them, the most challenging would be the incorporation of co-cultures of enterocytes and immune cells or of three-dimensional organotypic model of human colonic epithelium  <cit> .
