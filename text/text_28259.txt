BACKGROUND
massively parallel sequencing data generated by next-generation sequencing technologies is routinely used to interrogate single nucleotide variants  in research samples  <cit> . for example, deep sequencing confirmed the degree of genetic heterogeneity of hiv and influenza  <cit> . intra-tumor heterogeneity has been revealed by next-generation sequencing  <cit> . whole genome sequencing has revealed that many beneficial mutations of minor allele frequencies are essential to respond to dynamic environments  <cit> . however, rare snv identification in heterogeneous cell populations is challenging, because of the intrinsic error rate of next generation sequencing  <cit> . thus, there is a need for accurate and scalable statistical methods to uncover snvs in heterogeneous samples.

a number of computational methods have been developed to detect snvs in large scale genomic data sets. these methods can be roughly categorized as probabilistic or heuristic or some combination. among all of the current probabilistic methods, the bayesian probabilistic framework has been increasingly used to estimate unobserved quantities such as variant allele frequency given observed genomic sequencing data.

gatk  <cit>  and samtools  <cit>  use a naive bayesian decision rule to call variants. ebcall models sequencing errors based on a beta-binomial distribution, where the parameters and latent variables are estimated from a set of non-paired normal sequencing samples  <cit> . however, the error rate of normal sequencing samples could be unmatched with the error rate of the target samples, which may cause a problem of making false negatives calls  <cit> . crisp compares aligned reads across multiple pools to obtain sequencing errors, and then distinguishes true rare variants from the sequencing errors  <cit> . however, the bottleneck of crisp is its low computational efficiency due to a calculation of a large number of contingency tables.

jointsnvmix introduces two bayesian probabilistic models  to jointly analyze a tumour-normal paired allelic count of ngs data  <cit> . jointsnvmix derives an expectation maximization  algorithm to calculate maximum a-posteriori  estimate of latent variables in a particular probabilistic graphical model. furthermore, they showed that the joint modeling method, jointsnvmix <dig>  observes 80-fold reduction of false positives compared with its independent analogue   <cit> . somaticsniper models the joint diploid genotype likelihoods for both tumour and normal samples  <cit> . strelka models the joint probabilistic distribution of allele frequencies for both tumour and normal samples, which is demonstrated to be more accurate compared with the methods based on the estimated allele frequency tests between tumour and normal samples  <cit> . snver focuses on a frequentist method that is able to calculate p-values, but  <cit>  pointed out that this approach fails to model sampling bias that will reduce the power of detecting true rare variants. varscan compares tumour and normal samples thresholding on variant allele frequency and a number of allele counts then uses fisher’s exact test to estimate sample allele frequencies  <cit> .

in previous work, we developed a beta-binomial model to estimate a null hypothesis error rate distribution at each position. using this rare variant detection  model, we call rare variants by comparing the error rate of the sample sequence data to a null distribution obtained from sequencing a known reference sample  <cit> . rvd can identify mutant positions at a  <dig> % fraction in mixed samples using high read depth data.

an improvement of that work, rvd <dig>  uses hierarchical priors to tie parameters across positions to detect variants in low read depth data  <cit> . we derived a markov chain monte carlo  sampling algorithm for posterior inference. however, the main limitation of mcmc is that it is hard to diagnose convergence and may be slow to converge  <cit> . an alternative inference method, that we explore here, is to use variational inference, which is based on a proposed variational distribution over latent variables. by optimizing variational parameters, we fit an approximate distribution that is close to the true posterior distribution in the sense of the kullback-liebler  divergence. variational inference can now handle nonconjugate distributions and tends to be more computationally efficient than mcmc sampling  <cit> .

here, we propose a variational em algorithm for our bayesian statistical model to detect rare snvs in heterogeneous ngs data. we show that variational em algorithm has comparable accuracy and efficiency compared with mcmc in a synthetic data set. first, we define the model structure, and derive our variational em algorithm to approximate the posterior distribution over latent variables. then, we call a variant by a posterior difference hypothesis test between the key model parameters of a pair of samples. as a result, we compare the performance of the variational em inference algorithm to the mcmc sampling method and the state-of-the-art methods using a synthetic data set. finally, we show that our variational em algorithm is able to detect rare variants and estimate non-reference allele frequency  in a longitudinal directed evolution experimental data set.

methods
model structure
our bayesian statistical model is shown as a graphical model in fig. 1
a. in the model, r
ji is the number of reads with a non-reference base at location j in experimental replicate i; n
ji is the total number of reads at location j in experimental replicate i. the model parameters are: −μ
 <dig> a global non-reference read rate that captures the error rate across all the positions, − m
 <dig> a global precision that captures the variation of the error rate across positions in a sequence, and − m
j a local precision that captures the variation of the error rate at position j across different replicates.

the latent variables are: − μ

b, γ is the parameter for the variational distribution for latent variable μ, and δ is the parameter for the variational distribution for latent variable θ. we describe q and q in detail in the following section.

the model generative process is as follows: 
for each location j∈ : 
draw an error rate μj∽beta


for each replicate i∈ : 
 draw θji∽beta


 draw rji|nji∽binomial











the joint distribution p given the parameters can be factorized as 
  <dig> p=ppp. 


variational expectation maximization  inference
we developed a non-conjugate variational inference algorithm to approximate the posterior distribution, 
  <dig> p=pp, 


where the parameters are ϕ≜{μ <dig> m <dig> m}.

factorization
we propose the following factorized variational distribution to approximate the true posterior over latent variables μ
j and θ
ji. here, q approximates the variational posterior distribution of μ
j, which represents the local error rate distribution at position j across different replicates; and q approximates the posterior distribution of θ
ji, which is the error rate distribution at position j for replicate i. 
  <dig> q=qq=∏j=1jq∏i=1nq. 


evidence lower bound 
given the variational distribution, q, the log-likelihood of the data is lower-bounded according to jensen’s inequality, 
  <dig> logpr|n;ϕ=log∫μ∫θpr,μ,θ|n;ϕdθdμ=log∫μ∫θpr,μ,θ|n;ϕqμ,θqμ,θdθdμ≥∫μ∫θqμ,θlogpr,μ,θ|n;ϕqμ,θdθdμ=eqlogpr,μ,θ|n;ϕ−eqlogqμ,θ≜ℒ. 


the function ℒ is the evidence of lower bound  of the log-likelihood of the data, which is the sum of q-expected complete log-likelihood and the entropy of the variational distribution q. the goal of variational inference is to maximize the elbo. equivalently, q is chosen by minimizing the kl divergence between the variational distribution and the true posterior distribution.

since θ and r are conjugate pairs, the posterior distribution of θ
ji is a beta distribution, 
  <dig> p∽beta). 


therefore, we propose a beta distribution with parameter vector δ
ji as variational distribution, 
 θji∽beta. 


the posterior distribution of μ
j is given by its markov blanket, 
  <dig> p∝pp. 


this is not in the form of any known distribution. but, since the support of μ
j is , we propose a beta distribution with parameter vector γ
j as variational distribution, 
 μj∽beta. 


each component of elbo is derived in additional file  <dig> 

variational em algorithm
variational em algorithm maximizes the elbo of the likelihood by alternating between maximization over q  and maximization over ϕ={μ
 <dig> m
 <dig> m} . we update the variational parameters and the model parameters iteratively by numerically optimizing each problem using sequential least squares programming   <cit>  . there is no analytical representation for eqlogΓΓΓ), which is required to update variational distribution for μ
j and model parameter m. so, we must resort to numerical integration, 
  <dig> eqlogΓΓΓmj)=∫01qlogΓΓΓmj)dμj, 


unfortunately, this numerical integration step is computationally expensive. the variational em algorithm is summarized using pseudocode in algorithm  <dig> 





hypothesis testing
the posterior distribution over μj△∣rcase,rcontrol≜μj|rcase−μj|rcontrol is the distribution over the change in the non-reference read rate at position j between a case and control sample. since the variational approximate posterior distributions in the difference are beta distributions, the distribution of the difference is not analytically known. in order to compute the statistic of interest, we approximate μ
j|r
case and μ
j|r
control with univariate gaussian distributions by matching the first two moments of the variational beta distributions. then, the difference is a gaussian distribution. as we show in the section of comparison of approximated posterior distribution, the gaussian approximation is empirically reasonable.

under the variational approximation, 
  <dig> eq=γj1caseγj1case+γj2case 



  <dig> varq=γj1caseγj2case <dig> 


for μ
j|r
case and likewise for μ
j|r
control. we approximate the posterior for the case sample as 
  <dig> μj|rcase∼n 


and likewise for the control. then, 
  <dig> μj△∣rcase,rcontrol∼n 


now, we can approximate the posterior probability of interest, 
  <dig> pr, 


that is, the posterior probability that the difference in the non-reference read rate is greater than a fixed effect size τ  for a one sided test. for a two sided test, we compute the approximate probability 
  <dig> pr. 


a position is called a provisional variant if pr≥1−α/ <dig>  where the probability is approximated as described.

it is possible that a position is called a variant due to a differential non-reference read count, but no particular alternative base is more frequently observed than the others. in this case, the likely cause is a sequencing error that indiscriminately incorporates a non-reference base at the position. to discriminate this non-biological cause from the interesting true variants we use a χ
 <dig> goodness-of-fit test for non-uniform base distribution  <cit> . for each provisional variant, if we reject the null hypothesis that the distribution is uniform, we promote the position to a called variant.

RESULTS
data sets
synthetic dna sequence data
the data set we use to assess sensitivity and specificity is described and made available elsewhere  <cit> . briefly, we performed an in-vitro mixture of two dna sequences to test the sensitivity and specificity of our approach. two  <dig> bp dna sequences were chemically synthesized. one sample has  <dig> variant loci and is taken as the case and the other without variants is taken as the control. case and control dna samples were mixed in-vitro to yield defined nraf of  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %. the synthetic dna dataset was downsampled by 10×, 100×,  <dig> ×, and  <dig> × using picard . the final data set contains read pairs for six replicates for the control and cases at different nraf levels.

longitudinal directed evolution data
the longitudinal yeast data comes from three strains of haploid s288c which were grown for  <dig> generations under limited-glucose . the wild-type ancestral strain gsy <dig> was sequenced as a reference. aliquots were taken about every  <dig> generations and sequenced. the detail of library sequencing is described in  <cit> . the illumina sequencing data is available on the ncbi sequence read archive  <cit> . for this study, we received the original bam files from one of the authors. the aligned bam files have  <dig> –  <dig> × coverage. we used samtools  with -mpileup -c <dig> flags to convert bam files to pileup files. then, we generated depth chart files, which are tab-delimited text tables recording in each element of the table the count of a nucleotide at a genomic position. we ran our variational inference algorithm on the depth chart files to identify snvs.

performance on synthetic dna data
comparison of sensitivity and specificity
the performance of variational em algorithm is shown in receiver-operating characteristic curves  for a broad range of median read depths and nrafs in fig.  <dig>  the results in the roc curves are generated by varying parameter α in the posterior distribution test. it shows that the performance improved with read depth and true mutant mixtures. furthermore, we evaluated the performance by using both the posterior distribution test with α= <dig>  and the χ
 <dig> test to detect variants, and compared the performance with the mcmc sampling algorithm in terms of sensitivity and specificity .
fig.  <dig> roc curves with varying median read depths and nrafs





the variational em algorithm shows higher sensitivity and specificity than the mcmc algorithm in the events when nraf is  <dig> %. the variational em algorithm has a higher specificity compared with the mcmc algorithm for a median read depth of  <dig> × at  <dig> % nraf and  <dig> × at  <dig> % nraf, but the sensitivity is slightly lower due to false negatives.

comparison of approximated posterior distribution <dig> test when nrafs are  <dig> % and  <dig> % for low median read depth . this is to be expected because it is highly unlikely to correctly identify a variant base with a population frequency of  <dig> in  <dig>  with less than a  <dig> × read depth.

comparison to the state-of-the-art methods
we compared the performance of our variational em algorithm with the state-of-the-art variant detection methods, samtools  <cit> , gatk  <cit> , crisp  <cit> , varscan <dig>  <cit> , strelka  <cit> , snver  <cit> , mutect  <cit> , and rvd <dig>  <cit> , using synthetic dna data set . among all of the methods compared, our variational em algorithm has a higher sensitivity and specificity for a broad range of read depths and nrafs. our variational em algorithm shows higher specificity than all the other tested methods at a very low nraf  level. however, our algorithm has a slightly lower specificity than the mcmc algorithm when the median read depth is  <dig> × at  <dig> % nraf, and a slightly lower sensitivity than the mcmc algorithm when the median read depth is  <dig> × at  <dig> % nraf and a median read depth of  <dig> × at  <dig> % nraf. the performance of other methods is stated in detail in  <cit> .



runtime assessment
the computational time for approximating the variational posterior distribution is increased by expanding the length of region and the median read depth . our variational em algorithm is faster than the mcmc algorithm at the low median read depths of 27× and 298×, and slower for the high median read depths of  <dig> × and  <dig> ×.

variant detection on the longitudinal directed evolution data
detected variants
we applied our variational em algorithm to the mth <dig> gene at chr04: <dig> ,401- <dig> , <dig> , which is the most frequently observed mutated gene by  <cit> . our algorithm detected the same variants that were found by  <cit>  . additionally, we detected  <dig> novel variants in  <dig> timepoints that the original publication did not detect. in additional file  <dig>  g <dig> is the baseline nraf as the control sample when comparing with g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  and g <dig> in the respective hypotheses testing. the corresponding nrafs of called variants at different time points are given by the estimate of the latent variable, μj^=eq.

all of these variants, except the variant at position chr04: <dig> , <dig>  decrease in nraf following a maximum. the allele at position chr04: <dig> , <dig> is a beneficial variant that arises in nraf to  <dig> % at generation  <dig> within a constant glucose-limited environment. moreover, we identified the first emergence of this beneficial variant as early as  <dig> % in generation  <dig>  we detected  <dig> variants  early  in the evolutionary time course. given that the median read depth is  <dig> ×, we have some confidence these are bona-fide variants.

concomitant variants detection
we identified a pair of variants, chr04: <dig> , <dig> in gene mth <dig> and chr12: <dig>  in gene ade <dig>  that increase in nraf together in time . we hypotheses that the variants are concomitant in the same clone. in this pair of genes, gene mth <dig> is a negative regulator of the glucose-sensing signal transduction pathway, and gene ade <dig> is an enzyme of d
e
n
o
v
o purine biosynthesis. glucose sensing induces gene expression changes to help yeast receive necessary nutrients, which could be a reason for this pair of genes to mutate together  <cit> . further experimental validation of this hypothesis would be required to definitively show that the mutations are concomitant.

the global precision hyper-parameter m
 <dig> could influence the estimate of μ

CONCLUSIONS
in this article, we propose a variational em algorithm to estimate the non-reference allele frequency in the rvd <dig> model to identify rare nucleotide variants in heterogeneous pools.

our results show that the variational em algorithm  is able to identify rare variants at a  <dig> % nraf level with comparable sensitivity and specificity to a mcmc sampling algorithm;  has a higher specificity in comparison with many state-of-the-art algorithms in a broad range of nrafs; and  detects snvs early in the evolutionary time course, as well as tracks nraf in a real longitudinal yeast data set.

we have chosen parametric forms for the variational distributions. this choice has left us with a complex integral in our variational optimization problem. in future work, we plan to explore other approximations of the variational distributions that render the integral easier to compute. one could use cubic splines to numerically approximate the function and then integrate that surrogate  <cit> . another strategy is to consider a laplace approximation for the variational distribution, as we and others have done previously  <cit> .

improving the speed of the estimating algorithm enables us to interrogate whole-genome sequencing data. by doing this, we hope to reveal the dynamics of arising variants at the genome-wide scale to show the genetic basis of clonal interference. our method could be extended to study drug resistance by characterizing tumor heterogeneity in targeted anti-cancer chemotherapy samples, or to find the causative variants that lead to drug resistance and understand the causes of resistance at the single nucleotide level.
