BACKGROUND
white adipose tissue , traditionally viewed as an energy storage tissue, is now recognized as an endocrine organ that harvests and serves as repository of mesenchymal stem cells, the adipose-derived stem cells , for physiological cell renewal and spontaneous repair. henceforth, these asc have the potential to differentiate towards multiple tissue lineages, produce a large variety of growth factors and present immunomodulatory properties  <cit> . mesenchymal stem cells  homing from bone marrow to peripheral tissue is probably the most specialized organ repairing process. during the last few years it has been possible to isolate msc from different tissues  <cit> .

obesity, a chronic pathological condition, is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but paradoxically, it seems to protect against morbi/mortality from heart failure  <cit> . the hypothesis of a repository of stem cells in wat of heart failure-obese patients that may serve as a source for spontaneous repair has never been tested. it has been recently suggested that any alteration of the stem cell homeostasis by constant and repetitive trauma, and chronic disease could provoke a persistent disequilibrium inside the stem cell reservoir leading to an irreversible and premature decrease of the stem cells regenerative potential reducing their “stemcellness”  <cit> . because a growing body of evidence suggests that depot-specific variations in resident stem cells are retained despite in vitro culture processes  <cit> , we investigated the isolated stem cells from the adipose tissue niches to identify their changes due to obesity. indeed, we have previously reported that adipose-derived stem cells  from obese patients show a differentiation potential and are less proangiogenic than asc from non-obese individuals  <cit> . however, how obesity affects asc and which are the affected genes remain unclear.

differences in gene expression between subcutaneous and visceral wat have been reported. as such, genes involved in energy homeostasis and adipogenesis are profoundly altered in obese wat  <cit> . additionally, in obese individuals’ mature adipocytes, the major wat-cell types have shown to present an altered inflammation-related gene expression profile  <cit> . in addition, studies in subcutaneous preadipocytes from type  <dig> diabetes patients and obese pima indian subjects have reported diminished expression of genes involved in differentiation and an upregulation of inflammation-related genes  <cit> . moreover, obesity has shown to dysregulate the stemness gene network of omental-asc  <cit> . however, there are few studies investigating how obesity affects the transcriptome of resident stem cells reservoir.

in this study, we investigated the gene expression profile and the involved biological functions in asc of obese patients using a systems biology approach. asc were isolated from wat to avoid the contribution of differentiated cells in subcutaneous wat to the transcriptomic signature. we studied gene expression profile of isolated subcutaneous asc from patients with obesity and clustering of cardiovascular risk factors and asc from non-obese healthy individuals. we used a bioinformatic approach with “in silico” analysis to identify biological functions and target genes potentially altered in asc. further validation of candidate genes has identified potential targets associated to a reduced regenerative potential.

RESULTS
patient demographics and asc phenotypic characterization
asc were harvested from morbidly obese patients , and non-obese individuals . although both groups were comparable in age , morbidly obese patients showed significantly  elevated glucose , creatinine levels  and total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein cholesterol  ratio , and lower hdl cholesterol levels  as compared to non-obese individuals. no differences were detected in triglyceride, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol , urea, total proteins and hepatic enzymes levels.

flow cytometry analysis of isolated asc from morbidly obese patients  and non-obese individuals  revealed similar asc phenotype in both groups of cells at passage  <dig>  when the transcriptomic analysis was performed. both cell types strongly expressed typical asc surface antigens such as cd <dig> , cd <dig> , cd <dig> , and cd <dig>  and were negative for cd <dig>  a hematopoietic cell marker, and for cd <dig>  a marker of bone marrow cells, hematopoietic stem cells, endothelial progenitor cells and muscle stem cells . interestingly the flow cytometry analysis at passage  <dig> demonstrated that passage  <dig> cells had similar asc surface markers levels  with respect to passage  <dig> cells. however, a significant reduction in cd <dig> and cd <dig> was found indicating that the passage  <dig> cells used for transcriptomic analysis were a homogeneous asc population .

transcriptomic analysis
in order to compare gene expression patterns between ascmo and ascn, a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis was performed using affymetrix whole-transcript expression array. to visualize gene expression data we performed principal component analysis  that demonstrated the independence of transcriptomic signature in ascmo and ascn . to further explore genes differentially expressed between ascmo and ascn, we used modified analysis of variance  analysis. with a p-value <  <dig> , a 60% false discovery rate  and a fold change >  <dig> ,  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts were detected while with a p-value <  <dig> , a 60% fdr and a fold change >  <dig> ,  <dig> gene transcripts were detected . among the  <dig> detected genes,  <dig> exhibited an increased expression in ascn  while  <dig> were overexpressed in ascmo .

ascmo and ascn gene expression patterns
ingenuity pathway analysis  data identified the most relevant modifications in gene expression in ascmo. these genes were further validated by real-time pcr . developmental genes were down-regulated in the ascmo compare to ascn since a significantly reduced expression was observed in hoxc <dig> , tbx <dig> , acta <dig>  and sdf- <dig>  .

moreover, ascmo presented a significant up-regulation in genes that induce adipocyte lineage commitment or regulates adipogenesis, such as tcf <dig> , pitx <dig> , lif , tnfrsf11b  and hapln <dig> . contrary runx <dig> , that induces osteoblastogenesis, showed a trend towards a decrease expression in ascmo compared to ascn .

there was an up-regulation in the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules such as il-1β , il- <dig>  and ccl <dig> , and olr <dig>  in ascmo. the dual pro-apoptotic/pro-survival molecule dapk <dig>  is down-regulated in ascmo compared to ascn .

effects of cardiovascular risk factor clustering
correlation analysis between gene expression and bmi or clustering of cardiovascular risk factors  was performed. expression levels of acta <dig> , tbx <dig> , sdf- <dig>  and dapk <dig>  negatively correlated with bmi increase ; whereas lif , pitx <dig> , tnfrsf11b , il-1β  and olr <dig>  correlated positively  . furthermore, acta <dig> , hoxc <dig>  and tbx <dig>  negatively correlated with cardiovascular risk factor clustering ; while lif , pitx <dig> , olr <dig> , tnfrsf11b , il-1β  and il- <dig>  correlated positively  .

smad activation differs between ascn and ascmo
bioinformatic systems biology analysis predicted the smad pathway as a potential candidate in the activation/repression of the modified genes in obesity. in order to analyze smad pathway activation, we assessed nuclear translocation of phospho-smad <dig>  we show that ascmo present a lower activation of smad pathway, in fact, phospho-smad <dig> nuclear translocation were significantly reduced in the ascmo .

discussion
in this study we demonstrate that obesity affects wat-resident asc by differentially regulating their gene expression. the transcription of both genes involved in development as well those involved in adipocyte differentiation is significantly modified. moreover, asc from obese patients already show upregulation of inflammatory genes. interestingly, asc from obese patients with metabolic syndrome  show further impairment in their transcriptomic profile than asc from obese metabolically healthy patients.

asc in morbidly obese patients show similar asc surface markers  to asc from non-obese individuals. however, we had previously shown that ascmo have significantly different cell proliferation, differentiation and angiogenic potential  <cit> . here we show that asc from the subcutaneous wat of morbidly obese patients adopt a significantly modified expression profile with major changes on genes that regulate cell survival, cell differentiation, tissue integrity and metabolic pathways. interestingly, the asc  were negative for the surface marker cd <dig>  a marker described for bone marrow cells, hematopoietic stem cells, endothelial progenitor cells and muscle stem cells  <cit> . in fact, the expression of cd <dig> by asc has been a matter of discussion because of contradictory reports and findings  <cit> . while some authors have described an asc population that express cd <dig>  <cit> , some others have not been able to detect this marker  <cit> .

two highly conserved families of genes involved in embryonic development show down-regulation in asc from morbidly obese patients: the homeobox  and t-box . the hox code is mainly a “biological fingerprint” of different cell types reflecting a continuation of embryonic patterning  <cit> . despite the essential role played by hox genes in embryonic development, hematopoiesis, cancer, angiogenesis and wound repair, there is limited information on hox genes in a variety of msc. similarly, tbx <dig> is one of the fundamental developmental mesodermal transcription factors that is highly expressed in both human and rodent adipose tissue  <cit> . here we described for the first time that obesity down-regulates expression of tbx <dig> and hoxc <dig> in subcutaneous wat resident stem cells. the expression of both genes negatively correlates with bmi and cardiovascular risk factor clustering therefore potentially marking a reduced developmental potential of the more differentiated cells of the morbid obesity fat depot. the same result is shown with acta <dig>  an asc gene marker. it has been shown that mice asc expressing acta <dig> present multilineage differentiation ability compared to asc that do not express acta <dig> which only display adipogenic commitment  <cit> . the fact that expression of these three genes are found significantly decreased in asc from morbidly obese patients indicates that obesity impairs the multipotency of the stem cells homed into their subcutaneous wat.

stem cell migration is a key process for development, spontaneous regeneration and homing. it has been described that the cxcr4-sdf- <dig> axis regulates cellular trafficking  <cit>  and that asc produce and secrete sdf- <dig>  <cit> . circulating sdf- <dig> levels are decreased in diet-induced obese mice and in adolescents with elevated waist circumference and bmi measures  <cit> . in this study we show that asc in morbidly obese patients show a significant down-regulation in sdf- <dig> expression, and that the effect is bmi-dependent and correlates with cardiovascular risk factors clustering. these results indicate that obesity seems to impair asc trafficking and homing.

given that adipocytes share a common mesenchymal precursor cell with osteoblasts, entrance into the adipocytic or osteoblastic lineage is thought to be mutually exclusive  <cit> . in fact, our results revealed that the adipogenic lineage is stimulated in ascmo while osteoblastogenesis is inhibited. we have observed that tcf <dig> expression, a white wat-selective marker, is increased in ascmo. opposite, runx <dig>  an osteoblast marker, presented a non-significant trend to decrease in ascmo. tcf <dig> is the first useful positive selection marker for white preadipocytes and plays an important role in adipogenesis. it has been shown that tcf <dig> suppresses myogenesis  <cit> . of interest, pitx <dig> that is known to upregulate the expression of tcf <dig>  <cit> , is up-regulated in ascmo explaining the increase in tcf <dig> expression.

on the other hand, we detected that ascmo presented an increased expression in lif and tnfrsf11b genes. various studies of lif in adipose tissue have suggested that adipogenesis could be modulated by this gp <dig> cytokine at certain stages of development while regulating the expression of genes associated with lipid metabolism  <cit> . furthermore, tnfrsf11b  is a glycoprotein of the tumor necrosis factor  receptor superfamily that was originally discovered as bone resorption inhibitor  <cit> . its expression is high in human wat, and is increased during 3t3-l <dig> adipocyte differentiation and under tnf-α and il-1β stimulation  <cit> . in humans, plasma tnfrsf11b levels are elevated in patients with cardiovascular risk factors such as type  <dig> diabetes and abdominal obesity  <cit> . we have also detected that both lif and tnfrsf11b levels positively correlate with bmi and the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors. moreover, runx <dig> is involved in inhibiting adipocyte differentiation and appears to be down-regulated during 3t3-l <dig> adipocyte differentiation  <cit>  and obesity reduces bone runx <dig> expression leading to bone marrow adiposity  <cit> . interestingly, it has been published that asc from wat of obese patients show abnormal upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ , a gene that reveals a high adipogenic potential  <cit> . all together these observations indicate that morbid obesity not only affects asc multilineage potential but commit asc to adipogenic lineage.

recent studies demonstrate that during adipogenesis and development of obesity, the extracellular matrix  undergoes structural remodeling affecting adipose tissue expandability and functional integrity  <cit> . analysis of the secretome of human asc identified various components of the ecm synthesis and remodeling  <cit> . the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan is an integral component of ecm with an important role in organizing and maintaining the integrity of the ecm. although hyaluronan regulates differentiation of mesenchymal lineage cells to chondrocytes and osteoblasts  <cit> , it has been also shown that hyaluronan increases adipogenesis efficiency likely because it provides an appropriate ecm  <cit> . in fact, it has been demonstrated that hyaluronan synthesis, in 3t3-l <dig>  appears at the stages where early adipocyte markers develop and correlates with triglyceride accumulation  <cit> . interestingly we have detected in ascmo higher levels of hapln <dig>  a member of the hyaluronan and proteoglycan binding link protein gene family that stabilizes the interaction between hyaluronan and versican, two ecm components that contribute to the viscoelastic properties observed during 3t3-l <dig> adipogenic differentiation  <cit> . more experiments are needed to address how obesity and cardiovascular risk factors modify the adipose tissue ecm and its expandability.

obesity is associated with a low-grade chronic inflammation  <cit> . paracrine and autocrine signaling in wat-cells may further enhance inflammation, ultimately increasing proinflammatory cytokines production  <cit> . yet, it seems that adipocytes and mainly stromal vascular cells appear to be involved in the local production of such cytokines  <cit> . here we show that obesity induces inflammatory gene up-regulation already in the stem cells. il-1β, il- <dig> and ccl <dig> genes are up-regulated in ascmo. in fact, while we detected that il-1β increase is affected by bmi, il- <dig> expression is correlated with cardiovascular risk factors clustering. il-1β and il- <dig> are considered the prototypical proinflammatory cytokines involved in stimulating the synthesis and secretion of a variety of other interleukins, and also participates in a variety of cell functions  <cit> . furthermore, high circulating levels of il- <dig> and ccl <dig> have been found in obese subjects increasing the risk of coronary artery disease and type  <dig> or  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . in fact, il- <dig> released from subcutaneous wat and omental-asc displayed a positive correlation with bmi  <cit> , whereas ccl <dig> expression was higher in subcutaneous adipocytes of obese than non-obese pima indians  <cit> .

furthermore, we report for the first time that ascmo show increased expression of olr <dig> , a lectin-like receptor for oxidized-ldl. olr <dig> is expressed in highly vascularized tissues, plays critical roles in the development of atherosclerosis and related disorders, and is upregulated in hypertensive, dyslipidemic, and diabetic animals and humans  <cit> . a recent study reported that oxidized-ldl-olr <dig> interaction induces the generation of reactive oxygen species and stimulates pro-inflammatory gene expression  <cit> . thus, the effects of olr <dig> in obesity could be related to a complex state of inflammation and adipocyte death. in this study we identified that although olr <dig> expression levels in asc is low, morbid obesity and clustering of cardiovascular risk factors significantly increases asc olr <dig> expression.

finally, we have observed a significantly reduced expression of dapk <dig> in ascmo. the death-associated protein kinase- <dig>  is the prototypic member of a family of death-related kinases. however, dapks can also act as a survival factors and block apoptosis in response to certain cytokine signals modulating the balance between pro-apoptotic and pro-survival pathways  <cit> .

to address the signaling pathways differentially activated in ascmo, the validated gene expression data was analyzed in silico with the ipa software to obtain the most probable networks and biological pathways. candidate proteins identified by ipa were validated by western blot. as such, a lower activation of smad <dig> was found in the stem cells of the subcutaneous wat of obese patients. interestingly, the transcription factor smad <dig> plays a key role in the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation and in the development of insulin resistance  <cit> . this integrated bioinformatic systems biology approach led us to propose a network that regulates the differential gene expression pattern in stem cells found in subcutaneous fat of morbidly obese patients .

our data does not help to explain the obesity paradox. indeed, studies of patients with chronic heart disease suggest that overweight and obese patients may paradoxically have better outcomes than lean patients. this results may associate adiposity with enhanced cardiovascular autoreparative potential  <cit> . however our previous results  <cit>  and these here reported indicate that obesity renders asc less multipotent leaving the paradox unsolved. an alternative not yet fully explored possibility is that obesity could promote msc recruitment in order to perpetuate adipose tissue formation  <cit> , and consequently lead to increase number of circulating msc which in turn, upon organ damage, could migrate to the site of injury for repair  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, obesity produces a detrimental effect on its resident stem cells. in fact, the asc undifferentiated multipotent state is impaired in obese patients with respect to non-obese individuals. this study provides a global systems biology analysis of highly modified genes expressed in asc from patients with obesity and cardiovascular risk factor clustering that shows how the wat niche affect resident stem cells. a remaining question that deserves further investigation is whether obesity affects the mesenchymal stem cell transcription potential in the adipose tissue reservoir or stem cells are already conditioned by obesity in the patient’s bone marrow.
