BACKGROUND
a possible novel additional strategy used by bacterial pathogens during infection is to interfere with host cellular processes by inducing epigenetic modifications and, consequently, determining a new specific cell transcriptional profile. bacteria or their components could be a stimulus to change the genetic program of the target cells through epigenetic mechanisms  <cit> . these mechanisms may operate at gene-specific level and include both chromatin modifications, orchestrated by chromatin-remodeling complexes and histone-modifying enzymes, and dna methylation, directed by dna-methyltransferases. histone acetylation is in general associated to an active state of the chromatin while the effects of histone methylation may be associated with either transcriptional activation or repression, depending on which lysyl residue is modified  <cit>  and whether this residue is mono, di or trimethylated. among the best studied h <dig> lysine modifications are di- and trimethylation of h <dig> on lysine  <dig> and lysine  <dig> , associated with closed chromatin, and dimethylation of h <dig> on lysine  <dig>  that marks active chromatin state. dna methylation of cpg sites at gene regulatory regions is in general related to transcriptional repression and it is believed to be a more stable epigenetic mark compared to histone modifications  <cit> . however, chromatin modifications and dna methylation are strictly linked and can associate or interfere with each other  <cit> .

bacterial-host interactions have been shown to affect the histone acetylation, phosphorylation and methylation state at the tlr <dig> and il- <dig> promoter in host cells  <cit> .

the effects of lipopolysaccharide  on some aspects of host epigenetics have been recently reported in macrophages and t lymphocytes. in t lymphocytes, lps stimulation of tlr <dig> induces histone acetylation and h3s <dig> phosphorylation allowing for nf-κb to gain access to the il- <dig> promoter  <cit> . moreover lps-tolerance, associated with immunosuppression and poor prognosis  <cit> , has been shown to be controlled by epigenetic changes including methylation of h3k <dig>  <cit> . lps is the major component of the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria. the release of lps by bacteria stimulates both immune and specific epithelial cell types to release inflammatory mediators. although the effects of lps have been deeply studied on macrophages and t-cells, only few studies addressed the lps effects on the intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> . this is of particular importance because the intestinal epithelial cells represent a key component of the mucosal immune system and are able to express inflammatory genes in response to lps  <cit> . these studies addressed the signaling pathways leading to lps responsiveness of ht- <dig> cells, a human intestinal epithelial cell line, and demonstrated that lps response is mediated by gamma interferon  that induces the expression of the toll-like receptor 4-md- <dig> complex  <cit> . as a result of lps stimulation, the proinflammatory cytokine il- <dig> accumulates in the culture medium of ht- <dig> cells.

in this work we have investigated whether epigenetic mechanisms are involved in lps induced il- <dig> gene activation in human intestinal epithelial cells. we found that both histone acetylation and methylation changes at il- <dig> promoter, but not dna methylation, are involved in il- <dig> gene activation upon lps induction.

RESULTS
kinetics of lps-mediated il- <dig> gene activation in ht- <dig> cells
ht- <dig> cells are responsive to lps and il- <dig> protein accumulates in the culture medium upon such treatment  <cit> . we performed a time course analysis of il- <dig> mrna expression upon lps stimulation. ht- <dig> cells were primed with ifn-γ  in order to allow myeloid differentiation protein  <dig>  expression, which is required for ht- <dig> lps responsiveness as previously described  <cit> . activation of md- <dig> expression upon ifn-γ treatment was confirmed in ht- <dig> cells used in this study by semiquantitative rt-pcr analysis . then the primed ht- <dig> cells were treated with lps  and il- <dig> mrna levels were measured by real time pcr at different time points . il- <dig> mrna expression showed a striking increase in response to lps, reaching a maximum  <dig> hour after stimulation with  <dig> ng/ml lps and gradually decreasing at later times. these results were confirmed by semiquantitative rt-pcr analysis .

because nf-κb has a critical role in lps-mediated gene activation  <cit> , we measured by western blot analysis the protein levels of the nf-κb inhibitor iκb-α at short intervals after lps treatment. results shown in figure 1b demonstrate that iκb-α was rapidly degraded in ht- <dig> cells upon lps stimulation. a significant decrease in iκb-α was already observed  <dig> minutes after stimulation and persisted up to  <dig> minutes. these data are consistent with the observed kinetics of il- <dig> mrna expression .

inhibitors of histone deacetylases but not of dna methyltransferases reactivate il- <dig> gene expression in ht <dig> cells
in order to investigate whether il- <dig> gene may be regulated by dna methylation or histone acetylation state, we treated ht- <dig> cells with trichostatin , an inhibitor of histone deacetylases and with 5-deoxy-azacytidine , a drug that inhibits dna methyltransferases. rt-pcr experiments were then performed to measure il- <dig> mrna levels at different times after drug induction. results shown in figure 2a indicated that tsa treatment induces a concentration-dependent increase of il- <dig> mrna levels starting after  <dig> hours. the observed changes in il- <dig> gene expression were similar both in primed and in unprimed cells , indicating that tsa can induce expression of il- <dig> independently from the ifn-γ pathway. conversely, no effects were observed when ht- <dig> cells were treated with  <dig> μm or  <dig> μm 5-daza .

then we examined the effects of tsa and 5-daza on lps induced il- <dig> expression . ht- <dig> cells were primed with ifn-γ, pretreated for  <dig> hours with tsa or 5-daza, and then the cells were stimulated with  <dig> ng/ml lps. we found that cells pretreated with 5-daza showed an il- <dig> activation pattern very similar  to that observed in cells treated with lps alone , while tsa pretreatment significantly enhanced the lps-mediated il- <dig> activation . taken together these data suggest that histone acetylation state but not dna methylation may influence il- <dig> expression in intestinal derived ht- <dig> cells.

dna methylation analysis of il- <dig> promoter region
because the dna methylation state at promoter regions may indeed influence the chromatin changes during gene activation, we sought to validate ht- <dig> cells as a good model to study chromatin modification at il- <dig> locus. first, in order to confirm that dna methylation is not involved in il- <dig> gene regulation in ht- <dig> cells, we analyzed the methylation state of  <dig> cpg sites lying around the il- <dig> gene transcription start site , both on upper and lower strands by maldi-tof analysis of genomic dna extracted from untreated or lps-treated cells . we found that all five sites were completely unmethylated  both in untreated and in lps-treated cells . then, in order to investigate whether the observed dna methylation profiles at the il- <dig> locus were a specific feature of ht- <dig> cell line or resembled those present in human tissues, we analyzed dna from normal colon mucosa samples. results showed that, similarly to ht- <dig> cells, cpg methylation at il- <dig> locus in normal colon mucosa displayed an almost unmethylated state  on both upper and lower strands , confirming that ht- <dig> cells may be used to study chromatin dynamics at il- <dig> gene. interestingly, previous studies addressing the methylation state at il- <dig> gene in several breast cancer cell lines, showed that the cpg sites located at the il- <dig> promoter region were unmethylated in both metastatic and non-metastatic cell lines  <cit> .

lps-mediated il- <dig> gene activation is accompanied by both histone h <dig> acetylation and methylation changes
then we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  experiments in order to investigate whether specific changes in histone modifications occurred at il- <dig> promoter during lps-induced gene activation. first we determined whether il- <dig> activation corresponded to increased levels of histones h <dig> acetylation in the promoter region of il- <dig> gene. cells were incubated with lps for different times and chromatin was immunoprecipitated with anti acetyl-h <dig> antibodies; then pcr amplifications were performed using promoter-specific primers . we found that upon lps treatment h <dig> acetylation state was transiently modulated. the histone h <dig> was highly acetylated after  <dig> minutes while the deacetylated state was restored after  <dig> hours . hyper-acetylation of histone h <dig> is in agreement with expression pattern of the il- <dig> gene. then, we determined whether the induction of il- <dig> gene was accompanied by modifications of histone methylation state. antibodies against dimethylated h3k <dig> , dimethylated h3k <dig>  and trimethylated h3k <dig> , were used in chip assays. we found that the levels of h3k4me <dig> were low in untreated ht- <dig> cells, significantly increased  <dig> hour after lps administration, and gradually returned to basal levels within  <dig> hours . conversely, h3k9me <dig> showed a significant increase after  <dig> minutes and then rapidly decreased at  <dig> hour remaining lower than basal levels after  <dig> hours . these results, examined together with the expression data , are in agreement with the repressive role of h3k9me <dig> and with the activating role described for h3k4me <dig> in gene transcription  <cit> . the sharp increase in h3k9me <dig> levels observed at  <dig> minutes time point at il- <dig> promoter, despite the transcriptional activated status, could be explained by a possible concomitant demethylation of trimethylated h3k <dig> and consequent transient accumulation of the dimethylated form. however, already after  <dig> hour, the h3k9me <dig> demethylation was clearly evidenced by a significant reduction of its levels that remained lower than basal levels at il- <dig> promoter  <dig> hours after lps stimulation.

very interestingly, h3k27me <dig> levels were initially very low but then increased substantially starting at  <dig> hours and remained high  <dig> hours after lps stimulation .

h3k <dig> trimethylation is catalyzed by polycomb group  protein complexes  <cit> , which have been shown to be involved in cytokines genes reprogramming occurring in both epithelial and macrophage cells in response to bacterial products and inflammation-related stimuli  <cit> . it is also worth to note that when all the above chip assays were performed in unprimed ht- <dig> cells  we did not detect significant changes in histone h <dig> methylation state during the same time course  suggesting that the observed chromatin modifications are dependent on the md2/tlr <dig> pathway. however, because it is well known that even "pure" lps preparations may be contaminated with lipoproteins, we cannot definitively exclude that the observed chromatin modifications could be influenced by tlr <dig> signaling.

taken together our data indicate that while changes of h3-acetyl, h3k4me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> state in the il- <dig> promoter region occur rapidly, transiently and correspond to transcription activation, the changes of h3k27me <dig> levels occur at a later time and are long lasting.

finally it should be considered that a strong mark of gene repression, such as h3k27me <dig>  could predispose to a more repressed state of il- <dig> gene and, thus, could render the gene less responsive to further lps stimulation. moreover, h3k27me <dig> is also related to dna hypermethylation that has been shown to occur in intestinal cancer at pcg target genes. in particular, it has been recently demonstrated that hypermethylation of pcg target genes in intestinal cancer is mediated by inflammation  <cit> . thus, although our data indicate that dna methylation is not directly involved in lps response, such phenomenon may occur later, after prolonged exposure to lps, as a consequence of pcg proteins recruitment at il- <dig> gene.

in the near future it will be very important to investigate whether the observed increase in h3k27me <dig> levels at il- <dig> gene in response to lps may occur in intestinal mucosa and may represent a stable epigenetic mark; in this case the observed modifications could be potentially involved in two important phenomena such as the lps tolerance, and the hypermethylation of pcg target genes in intestinal cancer.

CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate an important role of histone modifications, including histone h <dig> acetylation and h3k <dig>  h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> methylation state, in lps-mediated il- <dig> gene activation in intestinal epithelial cells. in particular we demonstrate that h3-acetyl, h3k4me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> changes are early, transient and correlate with the modulation of il- <dig> transcriptional activity. conversely, increase of h3k27me <dig> levels at il- <dig> gene occurs later and is long lasting. our data provide novel insights into the epigenetic mechanisms that control transcription and gene expression in lps response.
