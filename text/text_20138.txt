BACKGROUND
carbonic anhydrases  catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide according to the following reaction: co <dig> + h2o ↔ hco3- + h+  <cit> . cas are zinc-containing metalloenzymes, except for the ζ form, which uses cadmium  <cit>  as alternative metal cofactor. additionally γ-cas contain iron in vivo, at least in anaerobic archaea  <cit> . the reaction catalyzed by cas is crucial in the regulation of acid-base balance in organisms. in addition, cas participate in many other physiological processes such as bone resorption in vertebrates, gluconeogenesis, production of body fluids, and transport of co <dig> and hco3- to name but a few  <cit> .

to date, five different classes of cas have been identified: α, β, γ, δ and ζ  <cit> . a previously known ε-ca class  <cit>  has been reclassified as a new type of β-ca based on its crystallographic structure  <cit> , which shows a fold nearly identical to those of the archaeal cab-type  <cit>  and plant-type  <cit>  β-cas. in ζ-ca, the geometry of the active site is nearly identical to that of β-cas, and there is also some similarity in the fold, which has led to the suggestion that even ζ-cas might represent a distantly diverged subtype of β-cas  <cit> .

the ζ-cas are found only in diatoms, and the δ-cas in diatoms and other marine phytoplankton, whereas the three major classes  are widely distributed. γ-ca orthologs are present in archaea, bacteria and plants  <cit>  but have been secondarily lost in animals and fungi  <cit>  . the α class is missing from archaea  but is nearly ubiquitously present in bacteria and eukarya, with the exception of fungi, in which only filamentous ascomycetes have α-cas  <cit> . in plants and animals, α-cas exist as numerous isoforms. for example,  <dig> and  <dig> α-cas have been described in non-primate mammals and primates including humans, respectively  <cit> . β-cas appear to be the class with the widest distribution as they have been described in multiple lineages throughout the tree of life, including most species belonging to the archaea and bacteria domains and probably all species of plants and fungi among eukarya . β-cas have also been characterized in a number of human pathogens such as fungi/yeasts   <cit>  and bacteria   <cit> , and their inhibition profiles by various agents such as sulfonamides, anions, carboxylates and boronic acids have been explored  <cit> . given that β-ca genes appear to be missing in invertebrates, novel antimicrobial compounds based on the inhibition of β-cas from pathogenic organisms may soon become available.

although β-cas catalyze the same reaction as α-cas and other ca forms, important structural differences between these classes exist. first, instead of functioning as obligate monomers like most α-forms or trimers like γ-forms, β-cas are found in many oligomerization states. crystal structures of dimeric, tetrameric and octameric β-cas have been reported  <cit> . in the active site of β-cas, the zinc atom is coordinated by one histidine and two cysteine residues instead of three histidine residues present in α-, γ- and δ-cas  <cit> . despite this difference, β-class cas basically share the same molecular mechanism for reversible hydration of carbon dioxide as α-class cas  <cit> . β-cas possess a highly conserved dyad comprising an aspartate and an arginine residue that seem to be crucial for the catalytic mechanism since mutation of these residues severely reduces the catalytic activity of the enzyme  <cit> . the aspartate makes a hydrogen bond with the zn coordinated water molecule, activating it for nucleophilic attack of the co <dig> molecule  <cit> .

β-cas have been reported in many photosynthetic organisms, including plants and algae  <cit> . in plants, β-class cas are strongly expressed in both roots and green tissues and are located in chloroplasts, cytoplasm and mitochondria with isozyme-specific patterns  <cit> . the cytoplasmic and chloroplastic cas are suggested to be crucial in co <dig> accumulation and carbon fixation. the green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii also contains β-class cas that are localized to mitochondria  <cit> . in fungi like cryptococcus neoformans and candida albicans, β-cas have an important role in co <dig> sensing and, consequently, in the pathogenesis of these species  <cit> . in addition, many fungal β-cas have been shown to be mitochondrial  <cit> . these and many other similar findings confirm that β-cas are physiologically important enzymes with variable localization and function like α-cas in vertebrates.

the presence of β-cas in the animal kingdom has been controversial or ignored due to the paucity and poor quality of the available sequences  <cit> . here we show, however, that β-cas are widespread among invertebrates. the aim of this study was to express, purify and characterize a β-ca enzyme from fruit fly , a commonly used model organism in biological sciences. the recombinant enzyme was produced in sf <dig> insect cells using the baculovirus/insect cell expression system. along with the characterization of the first arthropod β-ca, this study also describes its inhibition profile with inorganic anions. these results might open new strategies for developing novel anti-parasitic drugs against common diseases like schistosomiasis and malaria.

RESULTS
sequence analysis
we found β-cas in all complete non-chordate animal genomes and in almost all invertebrates with at least  <dig>  est sequences in the ncbi database, plus in some with fewer sequences. we confirmed the existence of β-ca sequences in placozoa, cnidaria, platyhelminthes, nematoda, arthropoda, and annelida, and even in many classes of deuterostomia, namely in hemichordata, echinodermata, and xenoturbellida. the only major taxon of protostomia with poor evidence for β-ca is mollusca, in which we found only one est to match  <dig> residues in other β-cas. of special interest were numerous pathogenic helminth species with complete β-ca sequences or substantial fragments, namely, filaria-causing brugia malayi, mouse whipworm trichuris muris, dog hookworm ancylostoma caninum, and the flukes schistosoma mansoni and schistosoma sinensis.

in the case of chordates, the existence of a functional β-ca is currently unclear. the genomes and ncbi est sequence collections  of ciona intestinalis and ciona savignyi  lack β-ca, whereas we found two recognizable but incomplete β-ca sequences in the genome of the cephalochordate branchiostoma floridae . the encoded proteins seem to lack more than  <dig> residues at the n-terminus, including the active site. in addition, there are two even less complete partial est transcripts, genbank bw <dig> and bw <dig>  the latter contains an unrelated sequence in place of the active-site-containing exon. we can only conclude that it remains an open question whether β-ca in b. floridae is a pseudogene or an incompletely sequenced active gene.

our survey discovered and assembled  <dig> seemingly complete and correct β-ca sequences from the genome and sequence databases of  <dig> metazoan species, including improved gene models for sequences already in sequence databases. fragmentary β-ca sequences were found in additional  <dig> species. multiple sequence alignment of all animal β-cas shows perfect conservation of the known active site motifs cxdxr and hxxc and several other key residues. figure  <dig> shows an alignment of the first  <dig> residues of selected β-ca sequences, including the n-terminal mitochondrial targeting peptide and active site regions . of the active-site residues indicated below the alignment, two cysteines and one histidine are zinc-binding residues. additional files  <dig> and  <dig> show the full alignment of the same sequences and of all of the identified sequences, respectively. the phylogenetic tree of the selected animal β-ca sequences is shown in figure  <dig> . the tree indicates that the duplication of β-ca genes in nematodes is specific for the nematode lineage. out of the two copies, the one labeled bca <dig> is more strongly conserved, as shown by shorter branches in the tree of figure  <dig> and in trees we made with all available sequences. the placement of the β-ca from acorn worm  seems contrary to conventional invertebrate taxonomy, but since some of the bootstrap values are under 50%, the tree is not perfectly resolved outside the insect and nematode blocks.

no β-ca sequences exist in vertebrate genomes. a false positive is found in the x. tropicalis genome, scaffold_ <dig>  which we attribute to bacterial contamination, since the β-ca sequence and every other gene in this scaffold are highly similar  with known genes of pseudomonas-related bacteria.

all of the complete sequences are classified as β-ca domains of type "bca_cladeb" in the ncbi conserved domain database. all plant β-cas are also classified as bca_cladeb domains, so animal β-cas can well be said to be "plant-type β-cas". there are also hundreds of bacterial β-ca sequences of type "bca_cladeb", and some of them cluster closest to animal sequences, and some closest to plant sequences in phylogenetic trees .

expression of β-ca in sf <dig> insect cells
sf <dig> insect cells were transfected with the β-ca gene  obtained from d. melanogaster cdna. the amount of protein obtained from  <dig> ml of culture supernatant was approximately  <dig> mg. according to sds-page, the relative molecular mass of dmbca was approximately  <dig> and  <dig> kda before and after thrombin treatment, respectively .

subcellular localization of dmbca
when the collection of  <dig> complete animal β-ca sequences was analyzed for subcellular targeting with targetp,  <dig> sequences were predicted to be mitochondrial, with low reliability, and most of the remaining sequences were predicted to be cytoplasmic, again with low reliability. the results from wolf psort, secretome  <dig>  and mitoprot ii v.  <dig>  also supported the hypothesis that it is a mitochondrial enzyme, with a possibility for non-classical secretion  suggested by secretome  <dig> . a mitochondrial targeting signal sequence is also predicted in the n-terminus . based on these findings, a dmbca-gfp construct was designed to study the subcellular localization of the protein in sf <dig> cells.

according to our experiments on the dmbca-gfp fusion protein, dmbca is indeed a mitochondrial protein, supporting the predictions made by bioinformatic tools. figure 4a shows the dmbca-gfp recombinant protein in sf <dig> insect cells in which the positive signal was located in intracellular granular structures. figure 4b shows the same cells labeled with a mitochondrial marker, mitotracker red cmxros™. figure 4c presents an overlay of the previous panels, demonstrating the colocalization of dmbca-gfp and mitotracker red cmxros™.

catalytic activity and inhibition of dmbca
dmbca purified from sf <dig> cells was kinetically analyzed in the presence or absence of acetazolamide or inorganic anions. the kinetic parameters of dmbca  were then compared with those of the thoroughly investigated cas such as the cytosolic and ubiquitous human isozymes α-ca i  and ii , as well as the recently described fungal β-cas, c. neoformans can <dig>  c. albicans nce <dig>  s. cerevisiae ca  and c. glabrata ca . all of these fungal enzymes are orthologous to nce <dig>  a protein found in all fungi/yeasts studied to date .

one can appreciate from the data shown in table  <dig> that dmbca, similar to the other recently investigated α- and β-cas, possesses considerable co <dig> hydratase activity. a kcat of  <dig>  ×  <dig> s- <dig> and a kcat/km of  <dig>  ×  <dig> m-1s- <dig> make dmbca one the most efficient β-ca described to date. data from table  <dig> also show that dmbca was appreciably inhibited by the clinically-used sulfonamide acetazolamide , with an inhibition constant of  <dig> nm. table  <dig> shows the dmbca inhibition screening data with anionic physiological species  as well as other non-physiological anions. note that similar to other investigated α- and β-cas, dmbca has an inhibition profile with anions characteristic only for this enzyme. several species such as bicarbonate, nitrate, nitrite, perchlorate, phenylboronic acid and phenylarsonic acid behaved as weak inhibitors , whereas other anions inhibited the enzyme more potently .

dynamic light scattering and gel filtration analysis
the hydrodynamic diameters of the proteins were measured by dynamic light scattering . at a temperature range from 4°c to 37°c the hydrodynamic diameter of dmbca was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm and the diameter was found to slightly increase during the heating. according to the hydrodynamic diameter the average molecular weight of dmbca was estimated to be  <dig>  kda, the lowest estimate being  <dig>  kda, and the highest  <dig>  kda . when temperature was raised above 43°c the hydrodynamic diameter of dmbca started to clearly increase and dmbca had a transition state at temperature range 46-49°c, where large protein aggregates appeared. this might be associated with protein denaturation.

at the temperature range from 4°c to 37°c the hydrodynamic diameter of hca ii was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm leading to estimated average molecular weight of  <dig>  kda, the lowest estimate being  <dig>  kda, and the highest  <dig>  kda . when hca ii was heated from 4°c to 43°c there was a slight increase in hydrodynamic diameter. however, no transition states were observed.

the estimated molecular weights determined by dls are in agreement with the values obtained by analytical gel filtration which gave a molecular weight estimate for dmbca of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kda and for hca ii of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kda. the molecular weight of hca ii monomer is  <dig> kda. therefore, gel filtration analysis appears to underestimate the molecular size of cas. overall, dls and gel filtration analyses suggest dimeric state for dmbca whereas hca ii appears predominantly monomeric in solution.

discussion
in the present study, we identified and characterized a novel β-ca enzyme  from an arthropod, d. melanogaster. although β-cas have been previously reported in archaea and bacteria domains, in addition to plants and fungi in eukarya, our results suggest the widespread occurrence of at least a single-copy β-ca gene among animal species distinct from chordates. the loss of β-ca gene in the chordate lineage may have occurred either in the last common ancestor of all chordates or in the last common ancestor of tunicates and craniates. whether cephalochordates have a functional β-ca gene remains an unresolved question.

using bioinformatic tools, we discovered a single β-ca gene in most invertebrates with reasonable sequence coverage. the exception is nematodes, which seem to have two β-ca genes in their genomes. a very recent article  <cit>  reported the cloning and characterization of c. elegans β-cas and the authors found that one of the two isoforms, bca- <dig>  has no activity and does not work in complementation assay. this might, however, be due to incorrect sequence: the sequence they show for c. elegans bca- <dig> contains the coding sequence of the preceding mtp <dig> gene fused to the β-ca reading frame. this sequence is a result of an incorrect gene prediction which has no support at the mrna level and which remained in wormbase and uniprot until may  <dig>  subsequently corrected from our initiative. the previously fused uniprot entry q8t3c <dig> now represents only mtp <dig>  and a new entry bca1_caeel contains the more plausible bca- <dig> sequence. since c. elegans bca- <dig> has all of the active-site residues and is also well conserved in other nematodes, we think it is probable that both isozymes in nematodes would be functional β-cas.

our larger phylogenetic analysis  and ncbi domain classification of animal β-cas clearly show them to be "plant-type" β-cas. the "plant-type" group also includes hundreds of bacterial β-cas, and this group contains plant/bacterial and animal/bacterial subgroups. the presence of such polyphyletic subgroups may indicate horizontal gene transfer, and further investigations are underway to study this phenomenon.

fasseas et al.  <cit>  state that the 3d structure of their c. elegans β-ca models would resemble archaeal "cab-type" β-cas, but we cannot agree with their conclusion. in our eyes, the models are nearly identical to the pea bca , and in our hands swissmodel http://swissmodel.expasy.org/ in fact chooses the pea β-ca structure as a template for both insect and nematode β-cas.

in the recent paper by fasseas et al.  <cit> , the enzyme activity of c. elegans y116a8c. <dig> was reported to be typical for β-cas, with a kcat and kcat/km of  <dig>  ×  <dig> s- <dig> and  <dig>  × 105m-1s- <dig>  respectively. these values are significantly lower than the kcat of  <dig>  ×  <dig> s- <dig>  and kcat/km of  <dig>  ×  <dig> m-1s- <dig> that we report here for dmbca. the enzymatic activity of dmbca is one of the highest reported so far for a β-ca, suggesting an important physiological role for this enzyme.

our studies with different anionic ca inhibitors did not reveal specific inhibitors of dmbca, which is in fact normal for such simple inorganic ions  <cit> . the inhibition profile of dmbca was unique for this enzyme, however, and differed significantly from other β-cas studied previously.

indeed, fluoride, chloride, cyanate, cyanide and sulfamide showed submillimolar inhibitory activity against dmbca, with inhibition constants in the range of  <dig> μm -  <dig> μm. another groups of anions, including bromide, iodide, thiocyanate, azide, hydrogen sulfide, bisulfite and sulfate showed inhibition constants close to  <dig> mm , thus making them weak dmbca inhibitors. other anions such as bicarbonate, nitrate and nitrite, as well as the non-anionic species phenylboronic acid and phenylarsonic acid, were much less effective inhibitors, with inhibition constants of  <dig>  -  <dig>  mm. it is interesting to note that bicarbonate, a ca substrate, is a weak dmbca inhibitor, but it appreciably inhibits the fungal enzymes nce <dig> , scca and cgca, with kis in the submillimolar range . even though the low apparent ki value for bicarbonate could be a reflection of allosteric inactivation of the enzyme , the value is still in the same range with the other anion inhibitors, suggesting that their mechanism of inhibition might be quite similar. the present inhibition data may suggest a different physiological role for dmbca in the insect compared to the corresponding β-cas in fungal or yeast species studied previously. one should also note that dmbca has a completely different inhibition profile not only compared to other β-cas but also compared to the highly investigated α-ca of human origin, hca ii .

animal β-cas constitute a separate subgroup in the β-ca family according to our bioinformatic analysis. because the main target, β-ca, is present in many parasites and disease carrying vectors but absent in humans, this discovery clearly carries the significant potential for the design of parasite-specific β-ca inhibitors. such drugs would presumably combine high specificity with a low incidence of side-effects in humans. these drugs could, for example, provide novel opportunities to restrict malaria propagation and to treat patients suffering from helminth infections.

predictions of subcellular localization placed most, but not all, animal β-cas in the mitochondria. our hypothesis is that all of them will be mitochondrial based on three main reasons. first, we have direct experimental evidence of mitochondrial localization of dmbca. second, all of the targetp predictions were either mitochondrial or cytoplasmic, both with low-reliability. third, the neural network used in targetp is trained with human and arabidopsis mitochondrial proteins; thus, it is perhaps not perfectly adjusted to detect the signals in invertebrate mitochondrial transit peptides. because of this mitochondrial localization of animal β-cas, we speculate that the β-ca gene in chordates might have been silenced and ultimately lost after the emergence of mitochondrial α-cas  to substitute for this function. the presence of an active ca in mitochondria has been linked to maintaining fundamental metabolic functions such as gluconeogenesis, ureagenesis and lipogenesis  <cit> . although our experiments were not focused on the role of the dmbca enzyme, its mitochondrial localization and high enzymatic activity suggest that knockdown studies in d. melanogaster are warranted to further investigate the physiological function of β-cas in animals.

the expression of dmbca has been studied at mrna level in two publicly available dna microarray datasets. in flyatlas  expression levels in  <dig> adult and  <dig> larval d. melanogaster tissues are given. the highest upregulated values in adult are found in spermatheca , fat body, and heart. in larval tissues  downregulated or average expression levels are seen for all tissues. a time course study published in flybase , shows upregulated expression of dmbca in early larval stages and late in metamorphosis, but downregulated levels in embryonal, late larval, early metamorphosis, and adult stages. the specific temporal and tissue patterns of expression suggest relevant functional and/or physiological roles for dmbca.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, fruit fly  β-ca  is an active mitochondrial enzyme for the physiological reaction catalyzed by cas, the hydration of co <dig> to bicarbonate and protons. it is inhibited by various inorganic anions, boronic/arsonic acids or sulfonamides. mammals do not possess β-class cas, but these enzymes are widespread throughout the phylogenetic tree, making them exciting new targets for parasitic drug development. indeed, β-cas are found in many pathogenic organisms and pathogen vectors of the animal kingdom, including the malaria mosquito anopheles, the yellow fever mosquito aedes, the filariasis vector culex, ancylostoma hookworms, brugia filarial nematodes, the blood fluke schistosoma mansoni and the liver fluke schistosoma sinensis. because animal-derived β-cas probably have a different predicted structure compared to the β-cas investigated so far in detail from archaea, plants, algae and fungi, as well as the α-cas, specific inhibitors against these enzymes could be designed with minimal effect on human cas and normal bacterial flora.
