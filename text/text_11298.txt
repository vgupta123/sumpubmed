BACKGROUND
distinct microbial communities hosted in and on plant organs are especially important in roots  <cit>  but also in leaves  <cit> . epiphytic organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, colonize the surfaces of aerial plant organs. microbes can arrive to or depart from surfaces of leaves through the action of rain, wind, or insects  <cit> .

for phyllospheric microorganisms, the potential benefits of living on leaves are obvious and include supplies of nutrients  <cit>  and carbon  <cit> . the bacteria themselves could also influence substrate availability by producing substances that increase substrate leaching from plant organs to the surface  <cit> . the advantages provided by phyllospheric inhabitants to their host plants, however, are not as apparent.

some reports have shown that both internal and external foliar microbiotas exert several effects on plants, including indirect protection against pathogens , protecting plants from diseases and promoting plant growth by various mechanisms  <cit> , and plant communication by affecting emissions of volatile organic compounds  <cit> . the relationships between microorganisms and their hosts include parasitic, commensal, and mutualistic interactions  <cit> . the classification of these relationships can be difficult, principally the discrimination between commensals and mutualistic symbionts, which represent a continuum  <cit> . many members of the human gut bacterial community were previously considered commensals but are now regarded as beneficial symbionts because of their contributions to host metabolism and immunity  <cit> . similar questions of host benefit and microorganism-microorganism interactions should be asked about the microbial communities associated with plants  <cit> .

foliar surfaces are habitually poor in nutrient availability, but significant amounts of organic carbon have been detected, including carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, and sugar alcohols . the heterogeneous nature of nutrient availability has been clearly observed on foliar surfaces  <cit> . the correlations of foliar mass per area, and nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations with foliar bacterial community structure have been well documented  <cit> . in addition to the carbon sources, volatile plant-derived metabolic substrates, including isoprenes and c <dig> compounds  <cit> , have been identified on foliar surfaces. methanol, that is a primarily by-product of cell-wall metabolism by pectin methyl esterases, is a prominent c <dig> source for phyllospheric microorganisms and is released in diurnal cycles  <cit> . methanol can serve as a substrate for a methylotrophic epiphytic bacterium  that confers a growth advantage to these organisms in situ  <cit> . bacterial communities on well-fertilized plants may be limited primarily by carbon availability and only secondarily by nitrogen availability  <cit> . bacteria can use several nitrogen sources, including organic nitrogenous compounds such as amino acids, which could be valuable sources of nitrogen for phyllospheric bacteria. ammonia may also be used as a nitrogen source in the phyllosphere  <cit> , and nitrogen fixation by phyllospheric bacteria has been reported  <cit> . phyllospheric bacteria also need to take up other macro- and microelements for growth.

plants produce a wide range of secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activity  <cit> , and microorganisms can also produce antimicrobial metabolites  <cit> . competition for space and nutrient resources, the production of antibiotics, and interference with cell-signaling systems in microbial communities are the principal mechanisms by which epiphytic bacteria and fungi antagonize each other  <cit> .

the complete set of metabolites of the epiphytic habitat, however, has not yet been analyzed. ecometabolomics  could provide such information. a metabolome is the entirety set of the small molecules in an organism as the final expression of its genotype  <cit>  and can be considered as the organismâ€™s chemical phenotype  <cit> . metabolomic techniques could be combined with the application of antibiotics against bacteria and fungi to discern the role in plant metabolism of microbial communities living on and in plant organs. in this way we aimed to determine the effect of microorganisms living into and on to plants on overall plant metabolism.

we have analyzed the metabolomes of the epiphytic habitats of leaves and flowers and of the organs themselves of the species sambucus nigra l. submitted to the application of antibiotics against bacteria and fungi. our detailed objectives were:  to determine the changes in the metabolic profile of the plant surface when epiphytic microorganisms are suppressed,  to determine the changes in the metabolic profile inside the plant organs when epiphytic and likely also endophytic microorganisms are suppressed, and  to study the similarities and differences between the internal and epiphytic metabolomes. these aims also allowed us  to investigate the synergies and antagonisms between the metabolic functions of the plants and the epiphytic microorganisms.

the concentration of only one identified metabolite  was higher in leaves after the antibiotic treatment, whereas the concentrations of five identified metabolites were lower . the antibiotic treatment caused the decrease of the concentrations of acetyl-coa and some of the related amino acids such as alanine. the concentrations of all amino acids involved in the ketoglutarate pathway also tended to decrease, as did the concentration of lactate. in contrast, the concentrations of the amino acids glutamic acid and glutamine involved the ketoglutarate pathway tended to increase in the foliar epiphytic extracts after antibiotic application. concentrations of vitamin b <dig> and some hexoses increased, while concentrations of vitamin b <dig> and pentoses decreased in the foliar epiphytic extracts under antibiotic treatment.fig.  <dig> differences between the standardized signal intensities of the identified metabolites in the lc-ms profiles of the antibiotic-treated and control leaves. the various metabolomic families are represented by different colors: green, amino acids; yellow, compounds associated with the metabolism of amino acids and sugars; cyan, nucleotides; brown, terpenes and phenolics; dark blue, sugars; dark brown, others. metabolites: amino acids: glu, glutamic acid; asp, aspartic acid; ala, alanine; arg, arginine; asn, asparagine; gln, glutamine; his, histidine; hpro, hydroxyproline; ile, isoleucine; lys, lysine; met, methionine; phe, phenylalanine; pro, proline; ser, serine; thr, threonine; trp, tryptophan; tyr, tyrosine. nucleobases: ad, adenine; ur, uracil. nucleosides: ade, adenosine; cy, cytidine; gua, guanosine; ur, uridine. nucleotide: amp, adenosine monophosphate. compounds associated with the metabolism of amino acids and sugars: cit, citric acid; lac, lactic acid; mal, malic acid; oxa, oxaloacetic acid; pya, pyruvic acid; sha, shikimic acid; sua, succinic acid; aba, abscisic acid ; asa, ascorbic acid ; cat, catechin. others: ani, adonitol ; toc, d-tocopherol; jaa, jasmonic acid; vi. b <dig>  pyridoxine ; rib, riboflavin ; vit, vitexin; car, carvone; sec, secologanin; log, loganin; cho, choline; nic, nicotine; vi. b <dig>  pantothenic acid ; vit. b6p, pyridoxine ; vi. b <dig>  thiamine . terpenes and phenolics: cafa, caffeic acid; cga, chlorogenic acid; chr, chrysin; coa, coumaric acid; pin, d-pinitol; fea, ferulic acid; hom, homoorientin; kae, kaempferol; pro, protocatechuic acid; que, quercetin; rha, rhamnetin; sap, saponarin; sia, sinapinic acid; sal, sodium salicylate; vaa, vanillic acid; fis, fisetin; rhap, rhamnetin. sugars: dis, disaccharides; hex, hexoses; pen, pentoses; raf, raffinose pentahydrate - maltotriose; xyl, xylitol - arabitol. asterisks and bold italic text indicate statistical significance  in one-way anovas



the effects of the antibiotic treatment on the identified metabolites were even stronger in flowers and in floral epiphytic extracts, with a general trend towards lower concentrations . the concentration of only one identified metabolite, the iridoid loganin, increased after antibiotic treatment, whereas the concentrations of most of the other identified secondary compounds such as terpenes and phenols and sugars clearly tended to decrease. concentrations decreased significantly for phenylalanine but tended to increase for the amino acids associated to the pyruvate pathway  in the floral metabolomic profile after antibiotic application. the concentrations of the identified metabolites in the floral extracts did not increase significantly after the antibiotic application, but the concentrations of the identified sugars and amino acids tended to decrease.fig.  <dig> differences between standardized signal intensities of the identified metabolites in the lc-ms profiles of the antibiotic-treated and control flowers. variables are colored and labelled as described for fig.Â  <dig>  asterisks and bold italic text indicate statistical significance  in one-way anovas



multivariate analyses

in the plot formed by the two first axes of the pca, the metabolic profile of the flowers showed a higher proportion of most amino acids, some sugars such as hexoses and xylitol-arabitol, and some secondary metabolites such as terpenes and phenols . the metabolic profile from the two first pca axes of the leaves showed higher concentrations of some metabolites associated to the krebs cycle such as malic acid, pyruvate, chlorogenic acid, quercetin, and oxaloacetate; nitrogenous bases such as adenosine, guanosine, and uridine; and most secondary metabolites .

when all the data was analyzed at once, the metabolic profiles from the two first pca axes of the plant organs showed higher proportions of most amino acids, some sugars such as hexoses and pentoses, and some secondary metabolites such as terpenes and phenols than the corresponding epiphytic communities. the epiphytic communities showed higher proportions of some amino acids such as lysine and methionine, some sugars such as raffinose, some secondary compounds such as chrysin and carvone, and of amp than plant organs. the epiphytic communities showed notably higher concentrations of lactate .

the epiphytic metabolomes were less variable than the organ metabolomes . epiphytic metabolomic variability was much less significant and lower between leaves and their epiphytic extracts than between flowers and their epiphytic extracts. the coefficients of variation of the pc <dig> scores were  <dig> % for leaves and  <dig> % for flowers.

the effect of the antibiotic treatment was greater in the epiphytic environment than in the corresponding organs metabolic profile, despite it was also significant in them. the permanova indicated overall shifts in the metabolomic profiles of leaves and flowers due to the treatment, being flowers more sensitive to the treatment than leaves. the decrease in lactate concentrations due to the antibiotic treatment was general in all samples, of organs and epiphytic extracts. also, the antibiotic treatment caused the decrease of the concentrations of citraconic acid in the foliar and floral epiphytic communities and the presence of pyrogallol in the floral epiphytic community.

discussion
effects of suppression of the epiphytic community on metabolic profiles
the effect of the antibiotic treatment on the metabolic profiles was evident in both the epiphytic communities and the plant organs. the observed shifts in the metabolic profiles of both internal plant organs and their epiphytic communities emphasized the importance of the microbiota in the metabolic function of plants. this study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first work that demonstrates a shift in the global metabolomic expression of a plant due to the suppression of its microbial community. the antibiotics were applied to all plant surfaces with an expected direct impact on the surface of the plant, but this antibiotic application also affected the internal plant organ metabolome, suggesting some levels of impact on endophyte microbial communities. these results were consistent with previous studies, which reported that some target metabolites or specific functions of a plant are related to microbial communities living into plant organs  <cit> . consistently with all this, some studies have shown that in internal plant organs it exists a wide microbial endophyte community, which is apparently not related to parasitism or symbiosis functions  <cit> .

the concentration of citraconic acid in the epiphytic extracts decreased after the antibiotic treatment. citraconic acid is produced by microorganisms  <cit> , particularly by the degradation of isoprenoid compounds  <cit> . this result was also consistent with the change in the molecular composition of terpene emissions observed after antibiotic treatment  <cit> . the decrease in terpene emissions reported by peÃ±uelas et al.  <cit>  was likely due to the impact of the antibiotics on the floral epiphytic microbiota, reducing de novo biosynthesis  or biotransformation . terpene biosynthesis is common in microbial metabolism, but only a few bacterial and fungal tps genes have yet been reported  <cit> , likely due to the low identities of the amino acid sequences of these enzymes compared with those in eukaryotes  <cit> . for example, the presence of some epiphytic microbes can induce an immune response by the plant and the subsequent emission of defensive terpenes from flowers to control their microbial communities  <cit> .

another interesting result was the decrease in the proportion of lactate in both organs and epiphytic extracts after the antibiotic treatment, suggesting an inhibition of fermentation. in fermentation, electrons are transferred from reduced substrates to oxidized intermediates to generate reduced fermentation products such as lactate  <cit> . our results, thus, strongly suggest that the anaerobic and/or facultative anaerobic bacteria are present in significant proportions in the phyllosphere and also in the endophytic microbial communities of s. nigra. a quantitative and qualitative study of the phyllospheric microflora of aloe vera showed that bacteria and yeast densities were relatively high, and bacteria were represented mainly by facultative anaerobic genera, dominated by enterobacteriaceae  <cit> .

the metabolite pyrogallol appeared in the floral epiphytic community after the antibiotic treatment. pyrogallol is a phenolic compound synthesized in plants by the shikimate pathway and is believed to function as a defensive agent against invading microbes and as a signal molecule in plant interactions with pathogens  <cit> . the presence of microorganisms may thus have either inhibited the synthesis of pyrogallol or biotransformed it, or, alternatively, the plant may have produced more when the potentially defensive role of the microbes was suppressed.

the antibiotic treatment caused the decrease of the concentrations of acetyl-coa and its derived amino acid isoleucine in the leaves. isoleucine is a precursor in the synthesis of several secondary compounds, many of which decreased in concentration after antibiotic application. the concentrations of the amino acid precursors of the ketoglutarate-synthesis pathway tended to decrease in the leaves and to increase in the foliar epiphytic extracts in response to antibiotic application. the concentrations of most of the detected metabolites generally decreased in flowers after antibiotic application, though the concentration of the others increase, such is the case of the amino acids associated to the pyruvate-synthesis pathway. these results indicated that the impacts of the antibiotic treatment on the metabolic profile of the internal plant were also significant, even though the impacts were stronger on the metabolic profile of the epiphytic. as previously mentioned, we observed that the concentration of lactate increase in the internal plant organs after being treated by the antibiotic. the environment of apoplasts  would be competitive for oxygen. fermentation is favored in these anaerobic situations, and high concentrations of lactate would be produced by the microorganisms. our results further suggest that 1) the antibiotics penetrated the interiors of the leaves and 2) the antibiotic treatment may have had a direct effect on plant metabolism  <cit> . unfortunately, this study did not allow to determine the cause of these effects; for instance, if they are the results of the internal microbial communities that respond to the antibiotic present in the plant cells. we cannot exclude also a potential antibiotic-induced damage to the plant tissues that further affects metabolic profile but no visual symptoms were detected nor there changes in exchange of co <dig> and water.

metabolic profile differences between leaves and flowers
the two plant organs studied had different metabolic profiles, with flowers having the more variable profile. the differences between these two organs explained the 58% of the total variance of the metabolomes. these results were consistent with those of previous studies showing different metabolic profiles among organs of the same plant, for example between shoot and root biomass in grasses  <cit> . functional specialization among plant organs is thus high and should be taken into account in ecometabolomic studies, because the metabolic functional response and the relationships between environmental variables and shifts in plant metabolomes can be very different, and even opposite, depending on the organ  <cit> .

s. nigra is pollinated by insects , so the higher concentrations of some sugars and amino acids in the flowers than the leaves may be related to nectar synthesis and to spore and gamete formation. floral secondary metabolites such as terpenes and phenols are produced to attract insects . leaves are the main photosynthetic tissue in trees and thus the site of primary production of the main biomolecules. this is consistent with the higher concentrations in leaves than in flowers of some metabolites, associated with the krebs cycle . foliar secondary metabolites such as terpenes and phenols are produced in defensive reactions  <cit> .

organ versus epiphytic metabolism
the high percentage of the detected metabolomic variables that differed significantly between the organs and epiphytic extracts, and the low percentage of compounds in the organs but not in the epiphytic extracts, or in the epiphytic extracts but not in the organs, indicated similar metabolomes, , as indicated by the pca.

the complex metabolic profiles were more similar between the two epiphytic communities than between the corresponding metabolic profiles of the organs. the metabolism of the epiphytic extracts may thus be much more conservative and homeostatic than that of the organs, and the metabolism of the flowers may be more variable than that of the leaves. the metabolomes of the two epiphytic microbial communities, however, differed significantly in some aspects.

plant organs have complex functions, and the leaves and flowers in our study had higher proportions of most amino acids, some sugars such as hexoses and pentoses, and some secondary metabolites such as terpenes and phenols than the corresponding epiphytic communities. the large variety of these compounds are thus provided by the plants and not by the microorganisms  <cit> . the epiphytic community, however, had a higher proportion of some amino acids such as lysine and methionine, some sugars such as raffinose. in especial, the increase of the concentration of some secondary compounds such as chrysin and carvone indicates that the microorganisms play an important role in the plant and can produce some metabolites for the immune response of the plant  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the antibiotic treatments changed the phyllospheric production of metabolites thus indicating a key functional importance of microorganism in plant epiphytic environment. we also observed that the antibiotic penetrated the plant organs, and their effects also suggested an important role of the microbiota in the metabolome of the organs. the differences in the metabolomic compositions between flowers and leaves were greater than the difference between their corresponding epiphytic environments. of internal plant organ.

the concentrations of citraconic acid, acetyl-coa, isoleucine, and several secondary compounds such as terpenes and phenols in the epiphytic extract decreased after the antibiotic treatment. the metabolite pyrogallol appeared in the floral epiphytic community only after the treatment. the concentrations of the amino acid precursors of the ketoglutarate-synthesis pathway tended to decrease in the leaves and to increase in the foliar epiphytic extracts. the proportion of lactate interestingly decreased in both the organs and their epiphytic extracts after the antibiotic treatment, suggesting a decrease in fermentation when the microbial populations were suppressed.

our results showed that microbial communities can thus play a role in the epiphytic and internal metabolomes of plant tissues and organs and could have more complex and frequent mutualistic, saprophytic, and/or parasitic relationships with internal morphological structures than currently known. a clear classification of these relationships can be difficult, particularly in terms of discriminating between commensals and mutualistic symbionts  <cit> . this study highlights the large complexity of the phyllosphere, the existence of internal microbial communities, and the strong relationships between the structure and function of the internal and external plant metabolomes. these results thus warrant further study of the specific relationships between plants and the microbial communities living on and in them.
