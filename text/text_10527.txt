BACKGROUND
during metazoan embryonic development, a totipotent zygote divides, grows and experiences intense post-embryonic anatomical and physiological changes resulting in an adult living organism constituted of different specific tissues  <cit> . this process is naturally correlated with spatial or temporal changes in gene expression. therefore, complete assessment of gene expression levels during ontogeny of an organism would be fundamental for giving a comprehensive dataset for genetic regulation of developmental processes. up to date, a large body of literature has reported the use of in situ hybridization, microarrays, and more latterly transcriptome sequencing  technologies for profiling gene expression during development of various model and non-model organisms . sturgeons, one of the earliest origins of vertebrate groups, constitute an important archetypal material for studying the origin of species and evolution . moreover, sturgeons are listed in the appendix of the endangered species by the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora   <cit> . however, scientific studies on molecular mechanisms controlling the development of sturgeons are scarce and generally focused on a narrow range of single genes or gene sets. transcriptomics resources for sturgeons have emerged just recently and, until now, data of sturgeon transcriptome include those made available owing to recent studies on reproductive tissues  <cit>  obtained by next-generation pyrosequencing of gonad transcriptomes of acipenser fulvescens, de novo assembly of the gonadal transcriptome of acipenser sinensis and microrna transcriptome and expression assay in acipenser schrenckii  <cit> . in addition, we have recently made available the largest sturgeons’ transcriptomics data using rna-sequencing  to generate the transcriptome for the early development of a. baeri  <cit> . nevertheless, little is known about late developmental stages of a. baeri and in regards to the molecular background concerning the transition from pre-larval to juvenile stages, even less information has been made accessible, thus hindering aquaculture practices for this species. studying this undiscovered molecular areas of a. baeri’s developmental biology, especially gene regulation underlying the transformation of embryos into adult fish, would be vital for feeding, reproductive and fish health management purposes, and would give insights into the biology of sturgeons and other related fish species.

the aim of the present study was to assess the transcriptome and the gene expression dynamics of three developmental stages of a. baeri ranging from the embryonic up to the 64 days old sturgeon stages.

RESULTS
sequencing data quality assessment and de novo assembly
in the present research, we utilized samples of a. baeri collected at three specific developmental stages including big yolk plug , wide neural plate formation  and 64 day old sturgeon with electric sensors ganglion . rna sequencing via the illumina hiseq <dig> system  produced about  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> raw reads for t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> covering  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  gb of sequence data, respectively. over 90 % of the raw reads survived quality cleaning and trimming and resulted in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> clean reads respectively for t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> with average length of  <dig>  for t <dig> and t <dig>  and  <dig>  for t <dig>  the sequencing reads were deposited in the ncbi short read archive  database  under the accession number srp <dig>  the sequenced reads were assembled using de novo assembly method. after removal of transcripts with short open reading frames   and weakly supported transcripts or isoforms , the final transcriptome contained  <dig>  assembled unigenes with n <dig> value of 1277 bp . samples t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> individually produced  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes with mean lengths of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp.table  <dig> statistical results of raw and preprocessed sequences



functional annotation of unigenes
to determine the function of de novo assembled transcripts, the whole set of sequences were aligned against the ncbi uniprot protein databases using blastx with an e-value cutoff of 1e- <dig>  the significant alignment results are reported in additional file  <dig>  the result showed that  <dig>  unigenes  had noteworthy hits to uniprot databases equivalent to  <dig>  single known proteins and  <dig>  homologous orthology clusters in uniprot protein databases whereas the remaining  <dig>  % unigenes could stand for utrs, non-protein coding genes or a. baeri-specific genes which were too different to be annotated by homology search with the adopted e-value cutoff. we performed analysis of blastx results to determine best species hits . the results showed the hits of a. baeri’s transcripts with  <dig> distinct species including fish species such as latimeria chalumnae , danio rerio , helobdella robusta  and oreochromis niloticus  and in minor extent to other vertebrate species.

the go annotation was performed by the mapping of unigene sequences with uniprot database and the recovery of go terms linked to protein sequences in uniprot. the results  showed that a total of  <dig>  unigenes  were ascribed at least one go term in the go classes of “cellular component”, “biological process” and “molecular function”.

in the kegg database ,  <dig>  unigenes  were annotated into  <dig> pathways. “metabolic pathways”  was the major pathway and was accompanied by “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites”  and “microbial metabolism in diverse environments” . in the pathway class of signal transduction, “pi3k-akt signaling pathway”  was the most exemplified. other pathways related to translation and diseases were similarly present. overall,  <dig>  unigenes were annotated in both go and kegg databases.

interproscan annotation  was exploited to detect conserved domains associated with the protein sequences. a total of  <dig>  unigenes  were annotated in interproscan and produced  <dig> domains. the statistics  revealed “zinc finger, c2h2” as the main conserved domain  followed by “wd <dig> repeat”  and “zinc finger, c2h2-like” .

unigene differential expression profiling
the expression level of each unigene was estimated in fpkm units using the rsem software protocol. after filtering transcripts with fpkm =  <dig> in at least one sample, a total of  <dig>  unigenes were considered as expressed within the three samples . the comparison of fpkm density of unigenes between samples is reported in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> fpkm density of unigenes obtained by pairwise comparison of samples collected at big yolk plug , wide neural plate formation  and 64 day old  stages of a. baeri. a fpkm density of unigenes by comparison of t <dig> vs. t <dig>  b fpkm density of unigenes by comparison of t <dig> vs. t <dig>  c fpkm density of unigenes by comparison of t <dig> vs. t22



to specifically identify genes that affect the development process, we analyzed gene expression changes for the  <dig> developmental stages using edger package  <cit>  for pairwise comparison . the fpkm scatter plots and the volcano plots obtained from pairwise comparison between samples are depicted in fig.  <dig>  the lists of all differentially expressed genes  screened from t <dig> vs. t <dig>  t <dig> vs. t <dig> and t <dig> vs. t <dig> are summarized in additional file  <dig>  only degs with p-value <  <dig>  at a fdr <  <dig>  and fold change >  <dig> were considered significant. the heat map showing the expression pattern of these degs and the heatmap of log <dig> were depicted in fig.  <dig>  the statistics showed  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  degs for the respective t <dig> vs. t <dig>  t <dig> vs. t <dig> and t <dig> vs. t <dig> comparisons. the pairwise comparison between t <dig> and t <dig> samples showed that degs were characterized by the upregulation of  <dig> and the downregulation of  <dig> genes while  <dig> downregulated and  <dig> upregulated degs were recorded by comparing t <dig> and t <dig>  the comparison between t <dig> and t <dig> led to  <dig> downregulated and  <dig> upregulated degs. as shown in additional file  <dig>  clustering of degs generated  <dig> subclusters with  <dig> of them presenting important characteristics. the subcluster_ <dig> was constituted of  <dig> degs initially highly expressed in t <dig> but downregulated in t <dig> and t <dig>  progressively. the  <dig> genes of the subcluster_ <dig> were initially lowly expressed in t <dig> stage but upregulated in t <dig> and further in t <dig> stage. the subcluster_ <dig> included  <dig> genes exclusively upregulated at t <dig> and probably in charge of morphogenetic transformations leading to adult individual.fig.  <dig> fpkm scatter plots and the volcano plots obtained from pairwise comparison between samples collected at big yolk plug , wide neural plate formation  and 64 day  old stages of a. baeri. the scatter plots compared the gene expression levels pairwise among the three libraries while volcano plots were generated using log <dig> fold-change against -log <dig>  displaying the amount of differentially expressed genes . a fpkm scatter plot of unigenes obtained by pairwise comparison of t <dig> vs. t <dig>  b volcano plot of unigenes obtained by pairwise comparison of t <dig> vs. t <dig>  c fpkm scatter plot of unigenes obtained by pairwise comparison of t <dig> vs. t <dig>  d volcano plot of unigenes obtained by pairwise comparison of t <dig> vs. t <dig>  e fpkm scatter plot of unigenes obtained by pairwise comparison of t <dig> vs. t <dig>  f volcano plot of unigenes obtained by pairwise comparison of t <dig> vs. t22

the pairwise comparison between t <dig> and t <dig> allowed functional enrichment of degs in  <dig> go terms  and  <dig> ko pathways and . for the go category of “molecular function”, pathways significantly enriched were gtp binding , transcription factor binding  and guanyl nucleotide binding  while developmental process , anatomical structure development  and single-organism developmental process  were the most represented in the biological process category. cellular component included membrane-bounded organelle , nucleus  and intracellular part  as significantly enriched go terms. among the significant ko pathways, leishmaniasis , ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes  and osteoclast differentiation  pathways were the most dominant.fig.  <dig> functional enrichment analysis of degs screened between wide neural plate formation  and 64 day old  stages of a. baeri. a histogram of the most significantly enriched go terms of degs screened between wide neural plate formation  and 64 day old  stages of a. baeri. degs were enriched in  <dig> go terms. the x-axis represents the  <dig> most significant go-terms in the three main go categories: biological process , molecular function , cellular component , which were further separated into  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> functional groups, respectively. the y-axis represents numbers of downregulated and upregulated unigenes mapping to the given functional go term. the significance of each go term was estimated based on fdr corrected p-values . b kegg pathway enrichment of degs screened between wide neural plate formation  and 64 day old  stages of a. baeri. the first  <dig> pathways were presented with  <dig> were significantly enriched. the x-axis represents rich factors of unigenes mapping to the given pathway. the y-axis represents the  <dig> first pathways based on the decreasing order of p-values. the significance of each pathway was estimated based on fdr corrected p-values 



study case 1: differences among morphogenic differentiation regulatory genes
in order to identify transcripts implicated in morphogenesis, we screened the go terms by searching for terms in relation with morphogenesis using the go enrichment file. on this basis, we found  <dig> degs associated with morphogenesis in the category of biological process. the go terms associated with these degs in the three pairwise comparisons and their expression profiles are summarized in additional file  <dig>  morphogenic differentiation degs screened between t <dig> and t <dig> were associated with the go terms of anatomical structure morphogenesis, anatomical structure formation involved in morphogenesis, tissue morphogenesis, embryonic morphogenesis and morphogenesis of follicular epithelium. we observed that  <dig> of these degs including acta <dig>  twn-a, aanf, buc, dlx5a, nkd <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  aplnr, apod, tbx <dig>  loc <dig>  sox <dig> and cbs were identified as up-regulated unigenes while  <dig> unigenes including bbs <dig>  dusp <dig>  cabz <dig> , cdc42se <dig>  ndp, robo <dig>  robo <dig>  errfi, loc <dig>  epha <dig>  d623_ <dig>  epb41l <dig>  lama <dig> and ctnnb <dig> were downregulated. in the transition from t <dig> to t <dig>  acta <dig>  twn-a, aanf, buc, dlx5a, nkd <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  aplnr, apod, tbx <dig>  loc <dig> and sox <dig> were found among the upregulated degs while the  <dig> downregulated degs included robo <dig>  errfi, loc <dig>  epha <dig>  d623_ <dig>  epb41l <dig>  lama <dig> and ctnnb <dig>  these degs were associated with anatomical structure morphogenesis, embryonic morphogenesis, anatomical structure formation involved in morphogenesis, tissue morphogenesis, morphogenesis of an epithelium and blood vessel morphogenesis. the transition from t <dig> to t <dig> was characterized by the upregulation of  <dig> and the downregulation of  <dig> degs encoding for biological processes such as anatomical structure morphogenesis, blood vessel morphogenesis, anatomical structure formation involved in morphogenesis, cellular component morphogenesis, cell morphogenesis, embryonic morphogenesis, regulation of cell morphogenesis and regulation of anatomical structure morphogenesis. the highest number of morphogenic differentiation degs  was found in t <dig> vs. t <dig> comparison while the lowest one  was found between t <dig> and t <dig>  the t <dig> vs. t <dig> comparison allowed the identification of  <dig> degs.

study case 2: changes among developmental regulatory genes
the definitive objective of this study was to identify an assortment of potential genes involved in developmental processes. through analysis of go enrichment output file, we found that  <dig> degs were directly implicated in developmental processes . in t <dig> to t <dig> comparison,  <dig> degs were enriched in  <dig> developmental process including embryo development, organ development, system development and tissue development with nos <dig>  schip <dig>  fbn2b, loc <dig> and loc <dig> as the most upregulated degs while the most downregulated degs included birc5b, buc, loc <dig>  nanog, lsm14b, lft <dig> and loc <dig>  in the t <dig> vs. t <dig> analysis,  <dig> enriched go terms  were orchestrated by the expression of  <dig> degs. genes postn, f3a, loc <dig>  scel, col1a <dig> and gfra <dig> were found as the most upregulated whereas fgfrl1b, twn-a, lft <dig>  nanog, buc, loc <dig> and tbx <dig> were significantly downregulated. in the comparison of t <dig> and t <dig>   <dig> upregulated degs including col1a <dig>  hg2a, loc <dig>  mbp, nebl and alas <dig>  and  <dig> down-regulated degs containing nanog, foxp1b, loc <dig>  alcam,fgfrl1b, twn-a, ripp <dig>  buc and tbx <dig> were in charge of  <dig> biological processes. similarities between t <dig> vs. t <dig> and t <dig> vs. t <dig> were observed, which further confirmed that t <dig> presented intermediary transcriptional changes.

candidate gene qrt-pcr validation
to validate the sequencing data, we randomly chose five unigenes, namely six3a, sox <dig>  hoxd <dig>  wnt11b and eya <dig> genes, to perform the qrt-pcr experiment using the same pooled rna employed for generating our rna-seq data. the expression levels of each unigene obtained by rna-seq or rt-pcr are presented in additional file  <dig>  in the sequencing result, we found that six3a was upregulated in t <dig> vs. t <dig> and t <dig> vs. t <dig> comparisons. hoxd <dig> as well as sox <dig> were upregulated in t <dig> compared to other samples. initially highly expressed in t <dig>  wnt11b and eya <dig> were progressively downregulated until t <dig>  the trends of expression of all five candidate genes, measured by qrt-pcr, were correlated with those of rna-seq method. altogether, qrt-pcr results largely supported rna-seq results.

discussion
with the advent of next-generation sequencing and the development of bioinformatics systems  <cit> , rna sequencing, which is preferred compared with the conventional sanger sequencing due to its low cost and high-throughput generation of quality transcriptome data, has turned into an essential instrument used in research and relatively short reads can be successfully assembled for non-model organisms . in this study, we have produced the first broad map of a. baeri transcriptome using an illumina paired end rna-seq platform for inspecting gene expression dynamics in early and late developmental stages. around  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> high quality reads were generated respectively for t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> from hiseq  <dig> and de novo assembled into  <dig>  unigenes. the number of unigenes was higher than that reported in the testicular and ovarian transcriptomes of a. schrenckii containing respectively  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes  <cit>  and that of the gonads transcriptome of a. sinensis constituted of  <dig>  unigenes  <cit>  or the  <dig>  high quality ests of a. naccarii organized into a freely available anaccariibase  <cit> . the higher number of unigenes generated here could be due to the fact that we performed sequencing using whole bodies of a. baeri samples, a deep sequencing coverage or differences in assembly softwares used. in addition, we remarked the increase of unigene amount in the transition from early developmental stages to subsequent late stages probably because of the activation of additional unigenes necessary for achieving new biological processes that arise harmoniously with the developmental course. this was in accordance with the fact that initial stages of vertebrate development depend dominatingly on maternal factors deposited in the egg with negligible zygotic translation until the complete activation of the embryonic genetic material  <cit> . the validity of de novo assembly was assessed by examination of assembled unigenes using publicly available protein databases, functional annotation and validation of randomly selected unigenes by the qrt-pcr. annotation of unigenes showed that  <dig>  unigenes  had noteworthy homologs in the uniprot databases while  <dig>  % of unigenes were ascribed at least one go term in the go classes of “cellular component”, “biological process” and “molecular function”. in the kegg database,  <dig>  % of unigenes were annotated into  <dig> pathways. the interproscan annotation produced  <dig> domains corresponding to  <dig>  unigenes . though various technologically advanced de novo assemblers  have been established, scientific studies have proven the efficacy of trinity since it is advantageous for annotation of transcriptomes for diverse vertebrate species  <cit> . here, a substantial amount of the trinity de novo assembled unigenes was annotated in known protein databases. the unigenes without hits presumably fit in with untranslated regions, non-coding rna, novel genes, short sequences without protein domain or assembly errors, and suggests that the a. baeri genome is still incomplete. our study will help in the future completion and full annotation of the a. baeri’s genome.

we equally examined the differential expression of unigenes and identified  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  degs from t <dig> vs. t <dig>  t <dig> vs. t <dig> and t <dig> vs. t <dig> comparisons according to our rna-seq data and high correlation was found between t <dig> and t <dig> while no significant correlation was recorded for t <dig> vs. t <dig> and t <dig> vs. t <dig>  this result showed that the degs match expectations in that the fewest number of differences were observed between the two early developmental stages , and the greatest number was observed between t <dig> and t <dig>  while t <dig> vs. t <dig> differences were intermediate. based on go enrichment analysis of degs, we identified  <dig> degs involved in morphogenic differentiation and  <dig> degs encoding for diverse developmental processes. besides, the go and kegg pathway functional annotation of the overall set of degs allowed identification of multiple functions and pathways in which degs between samples were involved. these data give insight in the gene expression alterations occurring in the transition from the early stage to the late stage of a.baeri development.

although the rna-seq experiment was performed using pooled rna extracted from  <dig> specimens per development stage, the dataset presents some limitations. there were no biological or technical replicates for the pairwise comparison between the  <dig> samples. the dataset is therefore un-replicated and ‘sample’, but not really ‘development-stage’ specific. consequently, although the statistical analysis of many transcripts yields statistically significant changes between these  <dig> pooled samples, the biological replicate is still n =  <dig>  so there is no variation in gene expression addressed. in addition, the present rnaseq data is a transcriptome screen, not necessarily a “functional assay” and the fact that we did not perform some translational experiments could mislead our interpretation because the gene function is not necessarily determined using rna-seq given that, while it is regarded and experimentally proven that instances of up- or down-levels of expression generally translate  into higher or lower protein levels, respectively, this cannot be automatically assumed without further biochemical analyses. post-translational modifications do occur that could alter anticipated final protein levels and hence influence pathway interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
our research established, for the first time, an extensive overview of rna-seq based characterization of the early and post-feeding developmental transcriptome of a. baeri as well as significant data on differential expression among both late and early developmental stages. the rna-seq provided considerable gene sequences that will be valuable for future molecular and genetic studies in a. baeri and other related sturgeon and fish species.
