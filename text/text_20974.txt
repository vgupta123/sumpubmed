BACKGROUND
cotton  is the leading natural fiber crop worldwide and an important contributor to the economies of nearly  <dig> countries. the genus gossypium is also an important model species for polyploidy and the biological processes of cell wall elongation and cellulose biosynthesis in fiber cells. this clade consists of approximately  <dig> diploid species and five allotetraploid species. genomes of the allotetraploid species have  <dig> chromosomes  and are believed to have originated from a single polyploidization event between an a-genome diploid  and a d-genome diploid  approximately 1– <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the five allotetraploid species share a basic ad genome architecture. chromosomes of the g. hirsutum genome  have been numbered according to their evolutionary origins and meiotic pairing relationships. chromosomes 1– <dig> comprise the “a” sub-genome  that originated from the extinct a-genome diploid ancestor and chromosomes 14– <dig> comprise the “d” sub-genome  that originated from the extinct d-genome diploid ancestor. there are four major cultivated species wordwide, two diploids g. arboreum  and g. herbaceum  and two allotetraploids g. hirsutum l. or upland cotton and g. barbadense l. , extra long-staple pima, egyptian cotton or sea island cotton. upland cotton cultivation represents over 95% of the fiber produced worldwide due to its high yield, but generally pima cotton the next most cultivated cotton, exhibits longer, stronger, and finer fiber.

upland cotton has a very narrow genetic base due to multiple bottleneck events including, polyploidization, domestication and continuous selection. it has been suggested and experimentally tested that current upland cultivars descend from only about a dozen introgressions and therefore exhibit an extremely small amount of diversity  <cit> . with such small diversity in elite cotton germplasm, it is unlikely that sufficient variation for agronomically important traits, such as, fiber properties, yield, disease and insect resistance, drought tolerance and changing atmospheric conditions will be found within currently available elite breeding germplasm. wild cotton species harbor large numbers of unique genes, which upon introgression may provide novel diversity for genetic improvement.

diploid cotton species have been shown to have many disease and insect resistance traits, as well as improved fiber characteristics. the diploid g. longicalyx hutch and lee  is the only member of the f-genome clade and is native to africa. it has been shown to have resistance to pathogens, such as reniform nematode  <cit> , and to have beneficial genes for fiber quality  <cit> . the diploid g. armourianum kearney  belongs to the d-genome clade and is a wild species found in mexico. it has been shown to exhibit resistance to the whitefly  <cit> , which is the vector for many cotton pathogens such as the leaf curl virus  <cit> . the diploid species exhibit a large range of relative genome sizes. due to the difference in chromosome number between diploids and cultivated cotton, methods to move genes from diploids into cultivated tetraploid cotton using synthetic tri-species hybrids have been devised to introgress desired diploid segments through breeding  <cit> .

while crossing cultivated tetraploid cotton directly with diploid species is difficult, allotetraploid species can be easily interbred and then backcrossed to move desired segments into cultivated material. the tetraploid g. tomentosum nuttal ex seeman originates from the hawaiian islands and produces a small amount of short, reddish brown fiber. g. tomentosum has been found to show resistance against the cotton leaf hopper, amrasca biguttula biguttula, and thrips, frankliniella occidentalis <cit> . the tetraploid g. mustelinum meers ex watt is from brazil and also produces a small amount of lint. using hplc analysis, g. mustelinum has been shown to have the highest leaf concentrations of terpenoid aldehydes that affect insect resistance  <cit> . g. barbadense originates from south america and is a cultivated species which represents about five percent of the annual worldwide fiber crop. this tetraploid exhibits excellent fiber quality characteristics for fiber length, micronaire and high strength relative to g. hirsutum.

many of the mapping efforts in cotton have consisted of interspecific biparental populations of g. hirsutum × g. barbadense which offers a higher polymorphism rate than intraspecific crosses, and segregation for superior fiber quality characteristics. moderate density linkage maps have been created using restriction fragment length polymorphisms   <cit> , amplified fragment length polymorphisms   <cit>  and simple sequence repeats   <cit> . ssrs have also been used for wide-cross whole-genome radiation hybrid  mapping for production of syntenic groups  <cit> . a consensus map was recently created which integrated all of the previous mapping efforts  <cit> . while single nucleotide polymorphisms  represent the most prevalent category of polymorphisms available within the genome, few studies have developed and mapped snps in cotton  <cit> . snp development efforts to-date have produced relatively few numbers of snps using different genome reduction methods in cultivated species .

an aspect of polyploid genomes that creates difficulties during snp development is that there are two indistinguishable types of snps in polyploid sequence data: homeologous sequence variants or “homeo-snps” and traditional snps or “allele-snps”  <cit> . a catalogue of homeo-snps, which are differences between the a-genome and d-genome diploid species, was recently identified in gossypium diploid and tetraploid genomes  <cit> . in cotton tetraploids, five million homeo-snps were found between the at and dt subgenomes, which was facilitated by recent publication of the reference genome sequence for g. raimondii   <cit> . the d <dig> genome is regarded as the closest living diploid relative to the d-genome ancestor of current ad-allotetraploid species  <cit> . it has been hypothesized that the catalogued homeo-snps can possibly be used to filter putative snps when sequence reads are aligned within the framework of the base-pair coordinates of reference diploid genomes  <cit> . while homeo-snps may allow for separation of homeologous sequences, they are not directly applicable to breeding. as allele-snps identify polymorphisms within a haplotype, experimental assays can be developed to genotype individuals and track favourable and unfavourable alleles. upon germplasm introgression from wild species, whether diploid or tetraploid, orthologous sequence variants become allele-snps. high-density interspecific allele-snps distributed across both sets of g. hirsutum chromosomes will be useful for breeders to efficiently introgress quantitative trait loci  and track alleles in marker-assisted selection  of beneficial traits from donor species.

traditionally, interspecific introgression breeding efforts are extremely time-consuming and require large amounts of effort and funds. interspecific genetic introgression into g. hirsutum has thus far been constrained by the paucity of high-throughput genome-wide markers that would facilitate tracking of introgressed segments. the relative scarcity of snps in cultivated allotetraploid cotton reflects the difficulty of developing snps for its complex genome, comprised of large repetitive regions and homeologous content due to recent polyploidization. here, we report a method utilizing the genomic reduction method of transcriptome sequencing to derive interspecific gene-associated snps between the genetic standard g. hirsutum tm- <dig>  and five other species, including the genetic standard g. barbadense doubled haploid line 3– <dig>  two allotetraploids g. tomentosum and g. mustelinum, and two diploids g. armourianum and g. longicalyx. these snps will be extremely beneficial for high-density interspecific mapping and will help revolutionize introgression breeding efforts by facilitating mas-based introgression, genetic dissection, and gene utilization in cultivated cotton.

RESULTS
snp development
utilizing the g. hirsutum  transcriptome assembly produced by ashrafi et al.  consisting of  <dig>  contigs covering over 70 m bp with n <dig> of  <dig>  bp, transcriptome sequence reads  were aligned and utilized to identity and filter a total of  <dig>  snps in silico for g. barbadense line 3– <dig> relative to g. hirsutum line tm- <dig>  with the same bioinformatic pipeline, snps were also developed for g. tomentosum , g. mustelinum , g. armourianum , and g. longicalyx . reads which mapped to multiple locations were randomly assigned to a single location to achieve higher mapping coverage with limited number of reads. filtering included removal of theoretical homeo-snp positions based on an index created by mapping back illumina tm- <dig> reads to the assembly. all of the markers identified within a given species were classified according to surrounding polymorphisms for the same species. marker classifications were based only on species-specific polymorphism data and determined independently for each species. “class i” was a snp in which no additional polymorphism was found to exist in the same contig. “class ii” was a snp in which  additional polymorphism was found within the same contig, but the additional polymorphism was outside of  <dig> base pairs  of the marker. “class iii” was a snp in which additional polymorphisms were found in the same contig and within 50 bp of the marker. the snps for g. barbadense, g. tomentosum, g. mustelinum, g. armourianum and g. longicalyx were classified according to these criteria .table  <dig>

removal of redundant markers
snps that were redundant across species were reduced to a single instance by means of progressive comparisons . the overlap with intraspecific g. hirsutum markers  was low, e.g., only  <dig> % or  <dig> markers of the g. hirsutum-g. barbadense snps were found to be redundant compared to the intraspecific snps. the overlap among the different species sets was plotted in a venn diagram, which revealed moderate levels of overlap among the three ad species . following the stated progression, a total of  <dig>  non-redundant g. barbadense snps were identified,  <dig>  were class i,  <dig>  were class ii , and  <dig>  were class iii . in addition, when the g. barbadense set was blasted against itself,  <dig>  markers were redundant within the g. barbadense set . snps of this redundant nature have been identified and listed separately for each species, so that they can be avoided  for future species-specific studies on alternative splicing or gene family composition. for g. tomentosum  <dig>  snps were retained,  <dig> in class i,  <dig>  in class ii , and  <dig>  in class iii , while  <dig> redundant snps were listed separately . a total of  <dig>  snps were retained for g. mustelinum,  <dig> in class i,  <dig>  in class ii ,  <dig>  in class iii  and  <dig> redundant snps . for g. armourianum,  <dig>  class i,  <dig>  class ii ,  <dig>  class iii  and  <dig>  redundant snps  were obtained for a total of  <dig>  snps. lastly for g. longicalyx a total of  <dig>  snps were identified, including  <dig>  in class i,  <dig>  in class ii ,  <dig>  in class iii  and  <dig>  snps which were redundant and listed separately . in the final set of  <dig>  non-redundant class i and class ii snps for all of the five species, the transition to transversion ratio was  <dig>  . non-redundant snps were unique in the final set for the snp and 50bp flanking sequences .figure  <dig>

alignment of markers to d5-reference genome
a moderate share  or  <dig>  snp markers in the final set could be aligned to the gossypium raimondii  diploid reference genome sequence. g. armourianum had the highest percentage of mapped markers, followed by g. longicalyx, and the three tetraploids g. barbadense, g. tomentosum, and g. mustelinum. nearly all of the mapped markers  aligned to one of the thirteen pseudo-chromosome scaffolds, and only  <dig>  markers were aligned to unplaced scaffolds. a bimodal distribution across each d5-chromosome was observed when average density of markers was plotted .figure  <dig>

validation of snps
random sets of markers from the non-redundant final set of class i and class ii snps were tested using kasp end-point assays  from each species. as random sets of markers for each species were selected for screening prior to development of the final non-redundant set, some markers may have been tested on species other than the ones with which they were associated in the non-redundant list of snps . this is due to the fact that some markers detected the same snp between g. hirsutum and multiple species and was retained only once in the non-redundant list. the validation status of each marker for tested species is noted in columns b and c of additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

in the final non-redundant data sets, a total of  <dig> randomly selected markers were tested from the g. barbadense class i and class ii set. of these,  <dig> markers were tested on the “g. barbadense screening panel”  and  <dig>  had clean clusters which allowed for scoring p <dig>  p <dig> and f <dig> genotypes . the remaining  <dig> markers were screened on panels from the other species  and  <dig>  of those were validated to have scoreable genotypes. sets of markers were also screened which fall under the species-specific data sets,  <dig> were tested from the g. tomentosum set of which  <dig> were tested on the g. tomentosum screening panel which produced  <dig>  successful markers. the other  <dig> markers were tested on other species and  <dig>  were validated. a total of  <dig> were tested from the g. mustelinum data set, of which  <dig> were run on the g. mustelinum screening panel and  <dig> were run on other species screening panels. these tests resulted in  <dig>  successful markers from the same-species tests and  <dig>  successful markers from the other-species tests. for the g. armourianum data set,  <dig> markers were tested, of which only  <dig> were tested on species-specific panels. overall,  <dig> out of the  <dig>  markers tested on g. armourianum produced successful assays. a small set of  <dig> markers was tested from the g. longicalyx data set, of which  <dig>  generated successful assays. a similar proportion of successful assays was obtained from snps generated for g. longicalyx using a different g. hirsutum assembly version that was abandoned because it yielded poor results when used to define snps in other species. unique snps from this set were extracted and included in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig>

discussion
interspecific germplasm introgression provides a powerful way of introducing novel beneficial alleles into breeding germplasm of upland cotton. its use has been constrained by the long time periods required for introgression and the difficulty of breaking linkage blocks. but when patience is exhibited and recombination has occurred to break linkage blocks to allow for introgression of interspecific segments, highly beneficial products can be obtained. such is the case with barbren which was created to move reniform resistance found in g. barbadense into g. hirsutum along with superior fiber characteristics  <cit> . combining features of g. barbadense with g. hirsutum has been a long-standing desire, because g. barbadense offers many superior fiber trait characteristics but does not produce the high lint yield of traditional g. hirsutum cultivars. the large number of g. barbadense snps identified in this study,  <dig> , and particularly the  <dig>  class i and class ii markers will provide markers for a large number of genes in which differences exist between g. hirsutum and g. barbadense. a modest number,  <dig> markers, have been validated  and the majority of these have been anchored to an allotetraploid chromosome by wwrh mapping, therefore relative physical location is known . a larger number of markers and/or larger wwrh panel would have been needed to link all of the singleton markers into the syntenic groups. markers within each group were close enough for statistical association, but the number and variety of deletions was insufficient to accurately determine physical order. the average number of plants with a deletion for a given snp was only  <dig>  , far short of the optimal deletion rate i.e., 50%. accurate ordering would require a far larger population of similarly irradiated plants or a population with a much higher deletion rate.

additional investigation into patterns of deletions showed that only  <dig>  of markers across individuals had a statistically significant number of deletions. this was a statistically insignificant number from the overall set. the relative abundance of these marker deletions suggests that the respective chromosomal segments have higher propensities for deletion and/or post-occurrence recovery of induced deletions. some chromosomal segments may be more likely to be lost after pollen irradiation, and/or there may be significant differences in selection for/against loss of specific genes/alleles in these segments that correspond to the identified markers.

placement of the syntenic groups relative to the d <dig> reference sequence revealed most to be in non-pericentromeric and non-telomeric regions, i.e., similar to the pattern observed for individual markers . snps were distributed unevenly across the chromosomes. a bimodal distribution was observed for each pseudo-chromosome scaffold, with large numbers of snps near the subtelomeric regions and small numbers in centromeric and telomeric regions, as would be expected given the metacentric nature of cotton chromosomes and the fact that the markers were derived from expressed sequences  <cit> . in addition all snps were found to integrate into a single syntenic group, unlike ssrs which integrate across groups, which implies the majority of snps are subgenome specific and will be useful for breeding as identifying a unique position in the genome.

mapping experiments were focused on g. barbadense. like upland cotton, it is a cultivated species and represents approximately five percent of the worldwide cotton production. however, g. barbadense being not as highly improved as g. hirsutum, it retains some alleles that are deleterious when brought into a g. hirsutum background. some research has been done utilizing chromosome substitution lines, in which a single chromosome in the g. hirsutum allotetraploid has been replaced with the same allotetraploid chromosome from a different species, for example g. barbadense <cit> . many beneficial regions have been identified for yield components as well as fiber quality traits  <cit> . recombinant inbred lines from these chromosome substitution lines have also been generated recently that will assist in introgression efforts once markers from a high-density dataset such as was developed here have been located for target areas. it has been shown that cryptic beneficial alleles are typically masked in the overall g. barbadense background  <cit> .

like g. barbadense, the other wild allotetraploid species, g. mustelinum and g. tomentosum, included in this study have also been shown to host cryptic beneficial alleles. these species have been integrated into the chromosome substitution line development effort and will provide additional trait resources for movement into a g. hirsutum background. being of allotetraploid genome constitution, most genomic segments from these species will easily be moved into g. hirsutum. integrating genes from wild diploid species like g. longicalyx and g. armourianum is much more complicated, because their diploid genomes are vastly different from the g. hirsutum genome. however with the longer divergence time and large number of diploid species available,  compared to uncultivated tetraploid species , a much larger number of unique beneficial alleles may be found in diploid gossypium species. inventive methods of creating synthetic polyploids with diploid species have been devised to facilitate transfer of genetic material into g. hirsutum, as was the case for g. longicalyx, in order to create upland cottons with strong resistance to reniform nematodes  <cit> . two sister lines with strong reniform nematode resistance, lonren- <dig> and lonren- <dig>  were released but subsequently discovered to suffer early growth season “stunting” suggesting a possible linkage drag or pleiotropic effect  <cit> . in general, practical utilization of introgressed alien germplasm demands precise genetic manipulation to separate linked beneficial and deleterious alien genes, for which numerous markers are essential. thus, large numbers of markers are needed for each germplasm source, such as the markers developed here. class i markers will be exceptionally useful as they can be used for determining haplotype information being the only marker identified within a contig.

studying shared markers between the different species of varied genome composition relative to cultivated g. hirsutum can be used to deduce the theoretical ancestral allele at a locus, as well as to suggest functional properties of a locus. the distribution of shared markers is depicted in figure  <dig>  for markers at which all wild species share a common allele but g. hirsutum differs, it can be inferred that the wild species share the ancestral allele and g. hirsutum contains an alternative allele. such alleles are good candidates for being functionally important to domestication, cultivation or agronomic performance, or in linkage disequilibrium with such genes. the non-synonymous to synonymous rate was found to be much higher in the  <dig> snps shared between species  than in  <dig> randomly selection snps from the final set . this implies that there is a stronger positive selection upon the snps where g. hirsutum has an allele which is non-ancestral. this further supports the hypothesis that these loci are likely to be important in beneficial traits in g. hirsutum.

some markers within the same species were identified from multiple scaffolds, but were identical in snp and flanking sequence . this is likely due to genes from gene families which exhibit very high levels of sequence similarity. therefore multiple hits are expected for genes that have expanded in the tm- <dig> or g. hirsutum lineage or are duplicated within a genome . another possible explanation is that these hits relate to contigs that contain different isoforms of the same gene. when snps derived from multiple isoforms are mapped physically or by linkage, they will locate to a single locus. snps from the former case will occupy multiple locations in which different members of the gene family are found. we classified these snps separately as they may represent multiple loci throughout the genome and present another level of difficulty for genotyping. the diploid species were found to have many more snps exhibiting within-species redundancy, which are marker sequences that are identical but generated from multiple contigs in the assembly, than the tetraploid species. this result was expected because the tetraploid g. hirsutum that was utilized as a reference likely received a copy of each gene from ancestors of the a and d subgenomes during polyploidization. thus relative to each diploid, the reference would have twice as many copies for each gene  and would lead to derivation of the same snp sequence from each of the homeologous copies found in g. hirsutum when analyzing the diploid species.

CONCLUSIONS
markers associated with functional differences between species are essential for generating a feasible system for germplasm introgression via marker-assisted breeding for beneficial agronomic traits. future large-scale mapping, fine mapping, and genome-wide association analysis efforts to associate the markers developed here as diagnostic markers for traits of interest will allow for marker assisted selection and back crossing to speed up introgression efforts. advancements in interspecific germplasm introgression are likely to create opportunities for profound improvement of cotton g. hirsutum cultivars and will allow for more sustainable provisioning of society in the face of population growth, evolving pathogens and insects, drought and changing environments.
