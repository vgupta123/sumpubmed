BACKGROUND
one of the important goals of post-genomic era is to develop tools/services to help in the annotation of hypothetical/putative proteins of newly sequenced genomes. in case of plasmodium falciparum, approximately ~60% of its genes did not show sequence similarity to known genes  <cit> . this organism showed an unusual amino acid composition and substitution in its proteins due to its extreme at rich genome composition  <cit> . as a result, many proteins show no or low sequence match to the known proteins in the database, posing a major difficulty in genome annotation. in order to address this issue we developed the symmetric smat series and the asymmetric pffsmat <dig> and demonstrated their better performance over standard matrices   <cit> . here we extend the use of these matrices to better annotate the proteins of other apicomplexa like plasmodium berghei, plasmodium chabaudi, plasmodium knowlesi, plasmodium vivax, plasmodium yoelii yoelii, toxoplasma gondii, cryptosporidium parvum, theileria parva and neospora caninum. after benchmarking the performance of these matrices for apicomplexan proteins, we develop apicoalign a web server for finding orthologs and aligning apicomplexan proteins using a novel series of matrices.

implementation
apicoalign is a web-based application written in perl/cgi language. the web server has five applications  search database  search a genome  reciprocal hit  best bidirectional hit and  pairwise alignment for apicomplexan proteins. the sample input buttons have been provided for some apicomplexan species for automatic loading of sample protein sequences in the required fields for each option. the parasite specific symmetric matrices  consisting of smat <dig>  smat <dig>  smat <dig>  smat <dig> and smat <dig> are provided for first four applications. smat matrices have been earlier demonstrated to work best for database searches  <cit>  of p. falciparum and here we show their superior performance for other apicomplexa to increase the utility of these matrices. for comparison, the standard blosum <dig> matrix and similar entropy matrix blosum <dig> have been provided in the drop down menu. for the first four applications, the default values for gap open and extension penalties have been set to  <dig> and  <dig> respectively that are defined best for the standard matrices with entropy similar to smat series. few other combinations of gap open and extensions have also been provided that the user can try. e-value cut-off may be defined by the user.

search database
the non-redundant , swiss-prot and pdb databases have been provided for finding orthologs for apicomplexan proteins using parasite specific and standard matrices. the input should be a single protein sequence in fasta format which can be pasted in the text box provided or uploaded through a file.

search a genome
this option has been provided for finding hits for apicomplexan proteins across different genomes provided in the drop down menu. the input is protein sequences in fasta format which can be pasted in the text box or uploaded through a file .

reciprocal hits
this option has been provided for finding reciprocal hits for apicomplexan proteins across different genomes provided in the drop down menu. the input is protein sequences in fasta format which can be pasted in the text box or uploaded through a file .

best bidirectional hit
the method of bbh   <cit>  has been employed for the search of potential orthologs of apicomplexan proteins across a range of organisms. the input for bidirectional ortholog detection is a protein sequence file of the query genome and that of the subject in the fasta format. the subject proteome may be either selected from the list of the organisms provided in the web page or in case of a user specific sequence file it may be uploaded through the file upload option. large sequence files may take a longer run time and the size of the uploaded query and subject sequence files is limited to  <dig> mb.

pairwise alignment
the pair-wise alignment option uses the water program   <cit>  for performing local alignments of the apicomplexan query protein and its potential ortholog. the asymmetric parasite specific matrix, pffsmat <dig> is provided for performing these alignments along with standard matrices eblosum <dig>  eblosum <dig>  epam <dig>  and pffsmat <dig>  pffsmat <dig> has been demonstrated to perform best for pair-wise alignments  <cit> , where the alignments span motif like regions of the protein. pffsmat <dig> is a scaled version of a unique asymmetric matrix  <cit>  used here for improving the alignment of an apicomplexan protein with its strongly suspected ortholog. hence, users are not encouraged to use this matrix indiscriminately for non-orthologous proteins. the input is a single protein sequence in fasta format for query as well as subject. the user may provide  the gap open and extension penalties for the pair-wise alignment. pffsmat <dig> was developed in context of plasmodium falciparum and represents unidirectional substitutions  <cit>  whose usage we extend to other apicomplexans in this study. hence, one of the limitations of the pairwise alignment is that the query sequence is restricted only to apicomplexa, therefore, the query and subject proteins should not be reversed in their order.

RESULTS
to check whether plasmodium falciparum specific substitution matrices  perform better for other apicomplexan species, we carried out database searches against non-redundant database  and found best bidirectional hits across different bacterial and eukaryotic genomes using blosum and smat series of matrices.

amino acid composition of different apicomplexan species
in our earlier study, we have shown that plasmodium falciparum has biased amino acid choices for its proteins and this is one of the reasons that standard matrices blosum & pam do not perform well in this case  <cit> . since the smat and pffsmat <dig> matrices were originally developed for plasmodium falciparum, we calculated the amino acid composition for all the proteins of apicomplexan genomes and compared them with that of non-apicomplexan mycobacterium tuberculosis genome . the amino acids were divided in four categories based on their properties:  non polar,  polar with no charge,  positively and  negatively charged amino acids. the p-value  between two genomes was calculated by taking means of amino acids of a particular category at a time and also for individual amino acids. the higher the p-value, the closer are the two genomes in terms of amino acid composition. figure  <dig> shows that all the apicomplexan genomes are having low p-values when compared to mycobacterium tuberculosis while they have higher p-values when compared to each other. in case of non polar amino acids  <dig> out of  <dig> apicomplexan species  show minimum p-value with mycobacterium tuberculosis while in case of positively charged amino acids all apicomplexan species except cryptosporidium parvum &neospora caninum show minimum p-value with mycobacterium tuberculosis. we observed similar patterns for polar amino acids with no charge  and negatively charged amino acids . we also calculated the p-values between genomes using individual amino acid fractions. the amino acid compositional similarities  for mycobacterium tuberculosis, plasmodium berghei, plasmodium chabaudi, plasmodium knowlesi, plasmodium vivax, plasmodium yoelii yoelii, toxoplasma gondii, cryptosporidium parvum, neospora caninum and theileria parva were 20%, 100%, 100%, 75%, 85%, 100%, 40%, 45%, 40% and 50% respectively when amino acids were considered individually rather than groups . the amino acid composition of plasmodium falciparum proteins is quite similar to that of other apicomplexan species and within apicomplexan species the similarity is more with other plasmodium sps. as different apicomplexan genomes show similar amino acid composition  as that of plasmodium falciparum, therefore substitution matrices  originally made for plasmodium falciparum should perform better  for other apicomplexan species also.

database searches
database searches  were performed for all the proteins of nine apicomplexan species  using smat <dig> and blosum <dig> matrices against non-redundant  database. the identical hits  given by smat <dig> and blosum <dig> were compared for the improvement in e-values and bit scores. plasmodium falciparum has been omitted as we have already reported the results for it  <cit> . these hits were classified in eight categories  better e-values and better scores with smat <dig> compared to blosum <dig>   similar e-values and better scores,  similar e-values and similar scores,  better e-values and similar scores,  poor e-values and similar scores,  similar e-values and poor scores,  poor e-values and better scores and  poor e-values and poor scores. the percentage of proteins was calculated for each category for all the nine apicomplexan species studied in this paper . the best non-self hits common to smat <dig> and blosum <dig> matrices along with their e-values and bits scores for these nine apicomplexan species against non-redundant  database have been provided as additional file 2: supplementary table s <dig>  similarly the performance of smat <dig> was compared with that of bosum <dig> matrix . after observing improvement in e-values and bit scores, we compared how many proteins give better or poor percent identity, longer or shorter alignment length and less or more number of mismatches using smat <dig> compared to blosum <dig>  and blosum <dig> . in plasmodium berghei, smat <dig> matrix  gives better & poor percent identity for  <dig> &  <dig> proteins respectively, longer & shorter alignment for  <dig> &  <dig> proteins respectively and less & more number of mismatches for  <dig> &  <dig> proteins respectively. similarly, smat <dig> matrix performs better for other apicomplexan species studied here . however in the case of toxoplasma gondii,  <dig> proteins give shorter alignment while  <dig> proteins give longer alignment with smat <dig> matrix  probably due to the large increase in percent identity . therefore, these comparisons of smat <dig> with blosum <dig> and blosum <dig> clearly show the superior performance of smat <dig> matrix over blosum <dig> & blosum <dig> for most of the apicomplexan proteins.

best bidirectional hits
the 'best bidirectional hit'  is one of the most frequently used methods to determine orthologous pairs. it assumes that a protein pair across two species in which each protein gives back the other protein as being the best hit in the whole other proteome is an orthologous pair  <cit> . we carried out the blast searches for ten apicomplexan species plasmodium berghei, plasmodium chabaudi, plasmodium falciparum, plasmodium knowlesi, plasmodium vivax, plasmodium yoelii yoelii, toxoplasma gondii, neospora caninum and cryptosporidium parvum and theileria parva using blosum  and smat series of matrices against different eukaryotes and bacteria without an e-value cut-off. a simple shell script was written to calculate the number of best bidirectional hits from these blast results for each apicomplexan species against each subject organism. this method generally gives a single bbh for a single protein, although theoretically it may give some many-to-many orthologs  <cit> . the number of bbhs for all the nine apicomplexan species were calculated from blast results against arabidopsis thaliana using blosum <dig>  blosum <dig>  smat <dig>  smat <dig>  smat <dig>  smat <dig> and smat <dig> matrices. in case of toxoplasma gondii , the blosum <dig> matrix gives bbhs for  <dig> proteins, blosum <dig> for  <dig> proteins, smat <dig> for  <dig> proteins, smat <dig> for  <dig> proteins, smat <dig> for  <dig> proteins, smat <dig> for  <dig> proteins and smat <dig> for  <dig> proteins. similarly for the other eight apicomplexan species the number of bbhs obtained using matrices of smat series is higher compared to that obtained using matrices of blosum series . we also calculated the number of bbhs which are not detected by blosum matrices but by smat & vice-versa and found that the number of bbhs obtained by smat matrices but not by blosum is higher than that obtained by blosum but not by smat matrices . we further calculated the numbers of bbhs for these apicomplexan species across different eukaryotes using smat <dig>  blosum <dig> and blosum <dig> matrices. the numbers of bbhs obtained by using smat <dig> matrix were higher than those obtained by using matrices of blosum series . in fact the numbers of bbhs for these apicomplexan species increase against bacteria as well when using matrices of smat series . we also estimated the number of apicomplexan proteins which give bbhs against the model eukaryote arabidopsis thaliana with smat <dig> matrix only but not when blosum <dig> or blosum <dig> matrix is used. these numbers are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins in p. berghei, p. chabaudi, p. falciparum, p. knowlesi, p. vivax, p. yoelii, toxoplasma gondii, cryptosporidium parvum, neospora caninum and theileria parva respectively.

examples and applications
best bidirectional hit for apicomplexan rhomboid proteases
the proteins pbanka_ <dig> , pfe0340c  and pvx_ <dig>  do not give any bbh in arabidopsis thaliana using blosum <dig> and blosum <dig> matrices. the present annotation  of pbanka_ <dig> and pfe0340c is rhomboid protease while that of pvx_ <dig> is a conserved hypothetical protein. using smat <dig> matrix, we got a single bbh  for all these three proteins and that is atrbl <dig> . all these four proteins  have same molecular function  and are integral to membrane . thereofore we can safely consider that these four proteins are true orthologs of each other and predict that pvx_ <dig>  is a rhomboid protease.

best bidirectional hit for splicing factor subunit of cryptosporidium parvum
the cgd2_ <dig> is a large subunit of u <dig> snrnp auxiliary factor of cryptosporidium parvum which do not give any bbh in arabidopsis thaliana using blosum <dig> and blosum <dig> matrices. the smat <dig> matrix gives bbh for this protein in arabidopsis thaliana  with same annotation. the e-values are 2e- <dig> and 5e- <dig> when cryptosporidium parvum is used as query and subject respectively.

alignment of experimentally characterized glutathione s-transferase from an apicomplexan
p. falciparum gst  is an experimentally characterized protein   <cit>  which has best bidirectional hits in all other five plasmodia studied in this paper. p. falciparum gst  and its orthologs in other plasmodia show very low level of conservation with yeast gst  using matrices of blosum series. we observed significant improvement in pair-wise alignment of this experimentally characterized pf-gst with yeast gst using pffsmat <dig> matrix by fasta program  as well as by water program. this significant improvement in alignment by pffsmat <dig> matrix was also observed for other apicomplexan gsts with yeast gst indicating the usefulness of these matrices for improving the alignment of diverged apicomplexan proteins moreover this improvement was observed with both fasta and water programs .

alignment of experimentally characterized protein kinase
the eukaryotic protein kinases  are a large family of enzymes with crucial roles in most cellular processes; hence malarial epks represent potential drug targets  <cit> . in case of plasmodium falciparum, pf11_ <dig>  is a known protein kinase which shows poor alignment with known yeast protein kinase with blosum series of matrices. the pairwise alignment of pf11_ <dig> against pik-related protein kinase and rapamycin target of saccharomyces cerevisiae  was performed with standard and pffsmat <dig> matrices by fasta program   <cit>   and water program  . we observed improvement in alignment by using pffsmat <dig> over other matrices irrespective of program used for alignment. with fasta program, blosum <dig> gave an alignment score of  <dig>  bits at an e-value  <dig>  with an overlap of only  <dig> amino acid residues, blosum <dig> gave an alignment score of  <dig>  bits at an e-value  <dig> with an overlap of only  <dig> amino acids. pffsmat <dig> gave an alignment score of  <dig>  bits at an e-value  <dig>  and the overlap was  <dig> amino acid residues. pam <dig>  a similar entropy matrix, gave an insignificant alignment with a score of  <dig>  bits and an e-value of  <dig>  for an overlap of only  <dig> amino acids.

alignment of two experimentally known acyl coa binding proteins
acyl coa binding proteins  are generally small  highly conserved proteins found in all four eukaryotic kingdoms animalia, plantae, fungi, protista and only eleven eubacterial species but not in any other known bacterial species or in archaea till now  <cit> . the long type acbps containing ankyrin repeats have been characterized experimentally in cryptosporidium parvum and arabidopsis thaliana, zeng et.al  <cit>  characterized the cpacbp <dig>  containing acyl coa binding domain and ankyrin repeats while xiao et. al  <cit>  studied similar type of acbp with ankyrin repeats from arabidopsis thaliana acbp <dig>  therefore we can safely consider arabidopsis acbp <dig> to be a true ortholog of cpacbp <dig>  we performed pairwise alignment of these two acbps using different matrices by fasta and water programs. we observed significant improvement in alignment by pffsmat <dig> though not much statistically but it was expected as these proteins  are highly conserved and show good alignment even with standard matrices. our purpose here was to see alignment of an apicomplexan protein with its experimentally known ortholog using standard and pffsmat <dig> matrices .

bi-functional enzyme of shikimate pathway across apicomplexan genomes
the shikimate pathway plays an important role in the survival of apicomplexans. the enzymatic activities of six out of seven shikimate pathway enzymes have been detected in crude extracts of either p. falciparum or toxoplasma gondii or both  <cit> . the chorismate synthase is the only enzyme that has been identified in apicomplexa to date. moreover the absence of this pathway in mammals makes it a probable drug target for apicomplexan parasites  <cit> . we have already reported the better alignment of a probable p. falciparum bi-functional protein, pfb0280w having epsp  and sk  domains with the yeast arom complex   <cit> . we have performed the alignments for orthologs of pfb0280w in p. berghei , p. chabaudi , p. knowlesi , p. vivax  and p. yoelii  with yeast arom complex and observed that the aligned regions had both the sk and epsp domains with pffsmat <dig> matrix while the standard matrix had only the sk domains aligned. an example alignment of p. berghei  and yeast arom complex is provided in figure  <dig>  while the remaining alignments have been provided in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 15: supplementary figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the length of overlap and the percentage similarity obtained for alignment of yeast arom complex with this protein across all plasmodia proteins with pffsmat <dig> and blosum matrices is provided in additional file 16: supplementary table  <dig> 

example of a missing metabolic enzyme - acylglycerol lipase
recently mohanty and srinivasan  <cit>  have attempted to identify some of the missing enzymes from the parasite genome using multiple profiles for every protein domain family. one of the predicted missing enzymes was a conserved plasmodium protein with an unknown function, mal7p <dig> . they predicted it to be acylglycerol lipase associated with glycerol biosynthesis pathway. saccharomyces cerevisiae has four experimentally characterized triglyceride lipases tgl2p , tgl3p , tgl4p  and tgl5p . we submitted mal7p <dig>  as query and compared it with all these four yeast lipases and the best match was observed with tgl5p   . pffsmat <dig> gives much larger and qualitatively better alignment compared to standard matrices as it covers the functionally important whole patatin domain  of yeast lipase tgl5p  .

CONCLUSIONS
the pfssm  were developed basically for p. falciparum and particularly for those proteins which do not find their orthologs in other eukaryotes or show very poor alignment with their orthologs. in this study, database searches, best bidirectional hits and the improved pairwise alignment of apicomplexan proteins have shown that these matrices perform better for apicomplexan species other than plasmodium falciparum and they can be thus helpful in improving the annotation of the same. to provide the access to these matrices for researchers working on apicomplexan species, we developed a web server apicoalign for detecting orthologs and aligning apicomplexan proteins. the real importance of this tool will be for those apicomplexan proteins which do not give any ortholog in other eukaryotes or show poor alignment at sequence level using matrices of blosum and pam series.
