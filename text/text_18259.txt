BACKGROUND
sequence variants affecting phenotypes between different individuals were believed to be mostly due to small differences, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> . however, when comparing two or more genomes within a species, gene presence/absence  variations have been also commonly observed in recent studies. since grant et al. found p/a polymorphisms in the rpm <dig> gene in arabidopsis <cit> , an increasing number of p/a genes have been reported in disease resistance genes in this model species  <cit>  and other land plants  <cit> . this phenomenon has also been described in the human genome  <cit> , the telomeric region in drosophila <cit>  as well as bacterial genomes  <cit> , which suggests that p/a polymorphisms have unique roles in species differentiation. additionally, several human diseases have been associated with gene insertions or deletions  <cit>  and in plants, there is evidence that p/a genes are involved in gene expression  <cit>  and noncollinearity in heterosis  <cit> . these examples indicate the importance of p/a genes in the evolutionary history of various species.

the commonly used definition of a p/a gene is that it is a gene present in some individuals but absent in others within a species at a particular locus, although there are different definitions in the literature  <cit> . the narrow definition of a p/a gene is one which exists only in one individual but not in another on a genome-wide scale. for example, it was reported in maize that 20% of genome segments  are not shared between inbred lines b <dig> and mo <dig>  <cit> . yu et al. found that  <dig> % and  <dig> % of rice indica and japonica genes, respectively, are unique to the subspecies  <cit> , while ding et al. found  <dig> % genes with p/a polymorphisms between nipponbare and 93- <dig>  <cit> . although a gene can be localized to a genomic position and be denoted as a p/a gene at that locus, it may have a paralog at a different locus. by using a broad definition,  <dig> % additional genes were classified as p/a genes among rice genomes  <cit> . our study also uses the broad definition of a p/a gene, which is one being found at a particular locus only in some genomes compared to the others.

most land plants have evolved by whole genome duplication and subsequent gene loss  <cit> . such extensive rearrangement events can result in a high proportion of p/a genes in plants. transposable elements  are dominant factors inducing intraspecies diversity in maize  <cit> . large duplications can be another source of genetic variation  <cit> . in arabidopsis, unequal and illegitimate recombination also plays an important role in triggering large-scale indels  <cit> . the arabidopsis genome is extremely redundant due to segmental duplications and tandem arrays  <cit> . these features provide ample opportunity for unequal crossing over to generate p/a genes. balancing selection is thought to be one of the mechanisms maintaining p/a polymorphisms, at least for some disease resistance p/a genes  <cit> . however, compared with the large numbers of detected p/a polymorphisms, the mechanisms for p/a gene generation and maintenance are complicated and remain unclear.

although p/a polymorphisms have been reported in several species  <cit> , there is still a lack of a clear estimate of the p/a gene number, proportion and variation pattern in any particular species, since a large number of fully sequenced individual genomes is the basic prerequisite for such studies. recently,  <dig> re-sequenced arabidopsis genomes were released  <cit>  and provided a unique opportunity to systematically study the characteristics of p/a genes. by analyzing the data, we identified a remarkable number of p/a genes and obtained an estimate of the p/a genes and their frequency distribution in the worldwide arabidopsis accessions. we also used this information to investigate the variation in p/a gene patterns among accessions and to provide a description of their preference locations on chromosomes. an analysis of the relationship between diversity and frequency of p/a genes was performed to explore the natural selection pressure, the evolutionary forces on p/a genes in arabidopsis populations as well as the mechanism for p/a generation.

RESULTS
identification of p/a genes
out of the total  <dig>  genes in the arabidopsis thaliana columbia  line,  <dig> genes  were found absent in one or more genomes of the  <dig> arabidopsis accessions using our approach. among these genes,  <dig> were absent in only one accession as shown in figure 1a. as the absent allele frequency in accessions increased, the number of missing genes decreased rapidly, except at the last outlying datapoint on this graph  which represents  <dig> genes absent in all  <dig> accessions. in other words, these genes were present only in the col genome.

since a remarkable proportion  of genes were found absent in multiple arabidopsis accessions, it was especially important to determine whether the identified genes were truly p/a loci. three methods were used to evaluate the reliability of the identification of these genes. first, we built a random model to predict the number of absent genes for a certain number of accessions by using data from the identified p/a genes in the  <dig> accessions. in this manner, a formula  +  <dig> ) was obtained when up to  <dig> accessions were randomly sampled . the trendline in figure 1b demonstrates that the number of absent genes increases logarithmically when the number of accessions sampled increases linearly, and we could estimate the absent gene number at each datapoint. for example, when  <dig> accessions are sampled, a total of  <dig> absent genes are expected based on the formula. fortunately, there are four independent populations  which have been fully sequenced with high genome coverage . we used the same methods as for the  <dig> accessions to identify the p/a genes in these four populations. a consistent result between the number of absent genes identified from independent samples and that predicted by the formula above would help to validate the p/a genes identified in the  <dig> accessions. in fact,  <dig> p/a genes were identified in the four independent populations, not significantly deviated from the number  predicted by the formula above , indicating a general reliability of the p/a genes identified.

second, we determined whether some of the p/a genes were truly absent by pcr. we randomly chose  <dig> genes for genotyping in randomly selected accessions. of the  <dig> less frequent p/a genes which were absent in one or ten accessions, nine genes  were determined to be false . meanwhile among the remaining  <dig> genes, which had a higher absence frequency, two of them  were not true p/a genes. therefore,  <dig> out of the  <dig> p/a genes were not truly absent, while the other  <dig> were confirmed to be absent  or did not generate pcr products , most likely due to the absence of the regions containing the primer sequences. our pcr results demonstrated that the rate of wrongly inferred p/a genes was 25% ) after excluding the uncertain results, while the majority of p/a genes  initially identified were truly absent.

finally, we evaluated the reliability of the outlier in figure 1a, the last datapoint with the abnormally high value of  <dig> p/a genes. this number could be accurate when there are large numbers of population-specific genes. in this case, it was reasonable for col, which was supported by bac-clone based genome sequences, to have many p/a genes; however, the other accessions could not have had such high numbers, because the re-sequenced genomes used col as a reference and therefore would not produce additional accession-specific p/a genes. however, when all  <dig> genes were subjected to blast search against the four genomes of c <dig>  bur- <dig>  kro- <dig> and ler- <dig>   <dig> out of the  <dig> genes produced no matches, while  <dig> had alleles in all four genomes. the blast results suggested that there were accession-specific p/a genes, but a large proportion  of the  <dig> genes were not reliable, probably because these genes could not be easily re-sequenced in the  <dig> accessions. thus, all of the genes at this datapoint were discarded in our subsequent analyses.

of the remaining  <dig>  p/a genes, the average number of absent genes per accession was  <dig> , which meant that  <dig> % of the genes were absent compared with those of col. this proportion was slightly lower than that reported in rice  <cit>  and maize  <cit> . additionally, nine arabidopsis resistance genes with known p/a polymorphisms  <cit>  were found to be included in these p/a genes, further supporting the validity of the method for their identification in this study.

characteristics of p/a genes among populations
we next determined whether the p/a genes were transcriptionally active. some genes, such as pseudogenes are not expressed, and therefore they would not affect biological processes in an individual. after blast searches in the arabidopsis transcriptome genomic express database, we found evidence of expression for all of the  <dig>  genes, suggesting that the p/a genes have biological functions. however, this analysis was performed based on the col annotation, and we could not confirm expression of these genes from other accessions.

it is rational to assume that many p/a genes may come from multi-copy gene families, and the homologous genes may have overlapping functions. to better group the homologs, genes with a nucleotide divergence less than  <dig>  were defined as a family. by this definition,  <dig>  p/a genes  were grouped into  <dig> families, but  <dig>  singleton genes  still lacked homologs in the col genome. in the  <dig>  non-p/a genes , there were  <dig>  genes  which belonged to multi-gene families. there was a significantly higher proportion of multi-genes in p/as than that of non-p/a genes , implying that the multi-copy genes were more likely to have p/a polymorphisms.

large deletions or the absence of genes can be derived from unequal recombination between homologs  <cit> . tandemly arranged or clustered genes are also abundant resources for generating gene conversion and unequal crossover  <cit> . therefore, the p/a genes may be a consequence of unequal recombination between clustered genes. here, we classified the p/a genes into clusters to investigate their physical locations . in total,  <dig>  gene clusters were found in the col genome, of which  <dig> clusters contained  <dig> p/a genes. in other words,  <dig> % p/a genes were clustered on chromosomes, significantly higher than the  <dig> % of clustered genes in the whole col genome .

co-variation between absent allele frequency and nucleotide diversity or gene length
the average nucleotide diversity of all the present alleles at the p/a loci was  <dig> . the level of nucleotide diversity may be associated with the frequency of absent alleles within a population. according to this hypothesis, a high frequency of absent alleles could be maintained with higher probability by balancing selection, an indication of higher diversity at a locus. to detect this association, the  <dig>  p/a genes were equally sorted into  <dig> bins based on their frequencies among accessions, such that each of these bins contained  <dig> genes. figure 2a shows the relationship between the frequency of absent alleles and the diversity of present alleles at a p/a locus. the increase in absent allele frequency  positively correlated with the average nucleotide diversity until the number of absent alleles reached  <dig> out of  <dig> accessions , after which the average diversity decreased. thus, there was a significant quadratic-like correlation between the nucleotide diversity and frequency of absent alleles . additionally, a similar pattern was found when investigating the relationship between the frequency of absent alleles and the length of p/a genes . the implications of these correlations remain to be clarified.

variation of p/a genes among populations
to examine variations in the pattern of p/a genes among accessions, a phylogenetic tree, based on the presence or absence of the  <dig>  genes, was constructed. we observed some extent of differentiation in these genes among the  <dig> accessions based on geographic origin . many genes with similar polymorphic patterns were found in accessions from the same countries. that is, these closely located accessions were likely to have similar spectrums of p/a genes. some accessions from the same geographic area, such as bak- <dig> and bak- <dig>  had highly similar patterns of p/a genes.

to better characterize the geographic distribution of p/a polymorphisms, a reconciled tree  was constructed to view the evolved p/a tree over an accession tree, built by using all snps of non-p/a genes . in the reconciled tree, we could see that the  <dig> accessions  were generally separated into eight geographic regions where they were sampled, and the p/a tree  matched the accession tree particularly in each of the  <dig> clades , indicating there was a strong correlation between p/a pattern and individual variation. both trees  demonstrated that p/a polymorphisms were related to the geographic regions, suggesting that population structure may play an important role in the generation/maintenance of p/a genes.

however, each branch  was quite different from others in the p/a gene tree. it was especially remarkable that no identical branches could be detected among the  <dig> accessions. the closest accessions were ice <dig> and ice <dig> , which had no snp detected in the non-p/a genes between them , but they still had different p/a polymorphic patterns at  <dig> loci. the same phenomena were found in comparisons between ice <dig> and ice <dig> as well as between ice <dig> and ice  <dig> 

distribution of p/a genes on chromosomes
the five chromosomes were divided into 1 mb sections and centromere positions were established as previously reported  <cit> . interestingly, a markedly nonrandom distribution of p/a genes was revealed along the chromosomes . the proportion of p/a genes  was always the highest near the centromere, and decreased monotonically to background levels over several megabases. this phenomenon could be attributed to the low gene density in the areas around centromeres, and thus the gene-rich regions were expected to have more p/a genes but not higher proportions. however, detailed examination showed the opposite finding. for example on chromosome  <dig>  the highest gene-density section with a total of  <dig> genes contained only nine p/a genes. meanwhile there were  <dig> p/a genes in the centromeric section where there were a total of  <dig> genes. the same pattern was also observed on chromosome  <dig>  and other chromosomes .

functional categories of p/a genes
gene ontology  terms are widely used as the standard for functional annotation. the  <dig>  arabidopsis genes have been assigned at least one go annotation from the tair and the institute of genomic research  databases  <cit> . the three organizing principles of go are cellular component, molecular function and biological process  <cit> , and according to the ‘go slim’ categories, genes are classified into small groups within each go hierarchy.

of the cellular component genes,  <dig> p/a genes  were related to membranes, comprising the largest proportion besides unknown components . compared to the overall frequency of membrane genes , the membrane-related p/a genes were significantly overrepresented . most of them encoded proteins in the endomembrane system , and the others were distributed within the plasma, chloroplast and golgi membranes. when analyzing the molecular functions,  <dig> p/a genes  encoded proteins with binding functions, mostly binding with protein and nucleotides, and were also overrepresented . however,  <dig> encoded proteins in the ‘other binding’ category could bind to zinc ion, while the remaining proteins had various ion binding functions. the activity terms of many enzymes, including hydrolases, transferases and kinases, were also numerous in the molecular function category. in the category of biological process, the highest proportion of these were related to stress responses .

moreover, we analyzed the frequency of p/a genes in different gene classes identified by pfam domain database  <cit> . in arabidopsis, 75% ~ 82% functional domains could be predicted by pfam  <cit> , and such a high proportion could cover most of the fundamental gene classes. classes involved in basic biological processes  and in regulation of transcription  had less impact . by contrast, disease resistance genes and f-box gene classes were affected extensively . in nbs proteins, the lrr domains are thought to mediate interactions with pathogen-derived molecules and reported to be highly variable  <cit> . this finding is consistent with previous studies in which the nbs genes often show p/a polymorphisms in arabidopsis and other plants  <cit> . additionally, f-box genes are thought to have undergone rapid birth and death in the arabidopsis genome  <cit> , as well as evolved quickly in response to pathogen pressure  <cit> .

discussion
number of p/a genes among populations
using our approach,  <dig>  genes were identified with p/a polymorphisms, indicating that about 10% of genes are likely to be maintained as p/a genes in arabidopsis. both the number and the proportion of p/a genes are remarkable, which may reflect their important roles in the species adaptation to the environment.

however, our approach could have overestimated the number of p/a genes. the pcr results indicated that 25% of the p/a genes were falsely identified. on the other hand, the number identified could be underestimated, because the proportion of false p/a genes was predicted to be much lower when the absent frequency was higher. moreover, only p/a genes which are in deletions, compared with the col genome, could be identified, based on the limitation of re-sequencing methods for the  <dig> genomes. if the p/a genes in insertions could be identified, the number of p/a genes could double. in fact, most of the  <dig> p/a genes present only in col but absent in all  <dig> accessions should represent p/a genes in col insertions, relative to the  <dig> accessions. this number was similar to the average number  of p/a genes per accession. in this case, each accession was expected to contain  <dig> % p/a genes. although the expected proportion is likely higher by two-fold, it was lower than that in rice  and maize  for each individual.

the difference in proportion of p/a genes identified here in arabidopsis, compared with rice and maize, could be due to the genome sizes, methods for pollination, transposon activity and/or domestication. the maize genome undergoes recurrent transposon events; therefore, observation of widespread dna sequence noncollinearity would not be unexpected  <cit> . the outcrossing method and the large genome size may also contribute to the high proportion of p/a genes. the rice genome is three times larger than that of the a. thaliana genome, which is more compact consisting largely of unique sequences  <cit> . moreover, the previous comparison of rice genomes was based on two individual plants under high pressure of artificial selection in different regions  <cit> , which would genetically create higher divergence  <cit> . these characteristics may explain the greater number of p/a genes observed in rice.

previously, clark et al. found that  <dig> , or  <dig> %, of a. thaliana protein coding genes were affected by large effect changes when comparing  <dig> accessions and one reference, col  <cit> . meanwhile, according to our formula, there should be  <dig>  absent genes when  <dig> accessions were randomly sampled. this number was less than the  <dig>  indicated by the authors above because the large effect changes included indels as well as snps and highly dissimilar sequences. ziolkowski et al. found large indels  distributed within  <dig> cds regions by comparing genomic data from two a. thaliana lines, col and ler  <cit> . this number was also larger than ours since not all indels result in gene deletions.

on the other hand, pseudogenization could be considered as another way of gene loss. across the  <dig> accessions, cao et al. found a total of  <dig>  genes with  <dig>  snps that caused large effects on gene structure, for example altered start codons, introduced premature stop codons, or affected splice donor or acceptor sites, were found  <cit> . consistent with their results, we found  <dig>  genes contained frameshift mutations or premature stop codons affected by both snps and indels in these accessions. the numerous p/a and pseudo- genes demonstrated that there were frequent gene loss events in arabidopsis populations. most interestingly, p/a and pseudo- genes had similar distribution in gene categories and on chromosomes. for example, there were a high proportion of pseudo- or p/a genes in nbs, f-box and p <dig> gene families. these results suggested that both pseudo- and p/a polymorphisms may play similar roles in contributing to the dynamic variations in some functional loci, e.g. through pseudogenization and p/a to escape the fitness costs  <cit> .

mechanisms of p/a gene distribution on chromosomes
our results revealed that the distribution of p/a genes was not random on chromosomes and that their proportion was especially high around centromeres. the p/a genes could be easily generated by unequal recombination between homologs, especially tandemly arranged genes. in this scenario, a higher proportion was expected in the areas with dense gene clusters. previous studies  <cit>  indeed support this mechanism to engender p/a polymorphisms in a. thaliana. generally, a. thaliana has a relatively compact genome and contains many unique sequences, e.g.,  <dig> % singletons by our definition in which  <dig> % of p/a genes were identified. nevertheless, there was a significantly higher proportion of p/a genes  found in the multi-gene families. within this multi-gene group with p/a genes, a significantly higher percentage of clustered p/a genes  was observed. although with some variation, the proportion of clustered p/a genes was indeed much higher on the chromosome arms  as expected. meanwhile on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  there were several p/a secondary peaks , at which most of the clustered genes were located .

however, a relatively smaller number of p/a genes clustered near the centromeric regions . this finding suggested that the unequal recombination events among p/a genes were not frequent in these regions, which is also reasonable since centromeres are reported to have low recombination frequencies  <cit> . however, we observed a high proportion of p/a genes  near centromeres, indicating that other mechanisms generated p/a genes in these areas. centromeres have highly conserved functions, serving as the site for kinetochore formation and sister chromatid cohesion, while it is also the most dynamic chromosomal region  <cit> . although the explanation for rapid evolutionary dynamics is still under debate  <cit> , stochastic events such as mutation and genetic exchange are apparent  <cit> . widespread gene conversion has also been observed in these regions  <cit> . unlike chromosome arms which have high gene density, the centromere usually contains specific types of dna sequences that are typically tandem repetitive sequences  <cit> , and its gene density is much lower in higher eukaryotes. therefore, the characteristics in these areas could induce a high rate of sequence exchanges, which may result in p/a polymorphisms. with a similar evolutionary characterization to the centromere, the telomeric region also contains much repetitive sequences. in drosophila, kern found a number of duplication and deletion polymorphisms in this region  <cit> . however, we did not detect a high p/a proportion in arabidopsis , which could be resulted from the evolutionary and genetic differences between plants and insects.

the generation of p/a genes in centromeric regions is clearly different from other areas. in the less repetitive regions, gene clusters could add or delete copies, which eventually could produce p/a genes. meanwhile in a region with abundant repeats, the unequal crossover among repeat sequences could cause the non-clustered genes to be added or lost, particularly singleton genes on chromosome arms and near the centromeres. it seems that there always are efficient ways to engender p/a polymorphisms in different regions.

in addition, arabidopsis underwent a paleopolyploidy event before splitting from brassica, which could produce abundant homologous genes and repeat sequences. although gene duplication is the major mechanism of sub- and neo-functionalization for a species to adapt to the new environment  <cit> , the redundant genes are great burdens for a host. therefore, the gene loss, which includes deletion and pseudogenization, could be an effective strategy to economize the cost. this explanation may primarily account for the higher p/a polymorphisms among homologous genes.

evolutionary forces for p/a genes in groups and populations
based on the go analysis, the proportion of p/a genes were quite different among gene function categories. within the go cellular component group, the proportions of p/a genes related to membrane and binding were found to be much higher than the others, although these two classes of genes are also relatively high within the whole arabidopsis genome  <cit> . most interestingly, in the category of biological process, the ‘response to stress’ group comprised the highest proportion of p/a genes , while its portion is only  <dig> % of the whole arabidopsis genome after excluding the biological process unknown genes. in this group, more than half were disease resistance genes. similar results were observed in the gene class analysis based on pfam domain database  <cit>  that revealed a high proportion of p/a genes in the nbs gene class . the varied distribution of p/a genes in different gene groups suggested that their proportions developed under natural selection. some nbs genes were reported to have p/a polymorphisms as they have hypersensitive responses to an avirulence protein encoded by a pathogen in arabidopsis <cit> . the co-evolution between the host and pathogen naturally leads to variable characteristics of nbs genes adapting to rapidly changing pathogenic populations. by contrast, classes involved in basic biological processes would contain fewer p/a genes due to their conserved functions.

in this study, an unknown evolutionary force was also indicated in the distribution of p/a genes among accessions, which exhibited little geographic differentiation based on the highly diversified branches in the p/a gene tree . the fact that there were no identical branches detected indicated that the p/a genes occurred commonly and maintained selectively in the worldwide arabidopsis populations. for example, the two closest accessions ice <dig> and ice <dig>  still had different p/a polymorphic patterns at  <dig> loci . both accessions within this pair were in similar environments, but their p/a patterns were relatively dissimilar. it seems a balance exists to maintain diverse sets of p/a genes, beyond the limitation of the geography-specific factors, biotic or abiotic, to enforce the fixation of p/a genes at a location.

nucleotide diversity of presence alleles at p/a loci
in our study, we observed a pattern of co-variation between absent allele frequency and nucleotide diversity among populations . to obtain convincing evidence of such a relationship, genes within the same absent frequency were randomly sorted, and then the  <dig>  p/a genes were equally sorted into  <dig> bins of  <dig> genes each based on their frequencies among accessions. a figure was also plotted based on the average nucleotide diversity under each frequency . in these different analyses, a significant co-variation was still observed between the values of the nucleotide diversity and their frequencies.

when the absent accession number was about  <dig>  which also meant the p/a frequency was at the highest , the highest average diversity was detected within present alleles. when the p/a frequency was low, the nucleotide diversity was also lower. a high level of diversity at a locus indicates that the polymorphism has been maintained for a longer time. that a higher frequency of a p/a gene equates with an older time of origin suggests that this type of polymorphism is relatively stably maintained, probably by natural selection. balancing selection may be one of these selective forces, which for example was suggested to act on the rps <dig> gene   <cit> , with a high absent frequency of 32/ <dig> and a high nucleotide diversity of  <dig> . interestingly, the signature of balancing selection at this locus was similar to the patterns observed in this study. this example suggests that balancing selection favors guarding resistance proteins based on the co-evolutionary arms race model  <cit> . indeed, when we compared the p/a gene numbers between different functional categories,  <dig> % of disease resistance associated genes had a relatively high absent frequency . this proportion was much higher than those in other groups, such as f-box  or p <dig> . the highest proportions of both p/a genes and absent frequency indicate that some disease resistance related genes are more likely to be under balancing selection to respond to variations in corresponding pathogens. by contrast, a lower diversity means that the gene is relatively young, and therefore its p/a frequency is lower and probably subject to random drifting. the younger or recently generated p/a genes may be in flux, and their fate may either be to eventually become deleted or fixed by random drifting or natural selection. these types of p/a genes are more likely to be under neutral mutational and population genetic processes.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified a remarkable number of p/a genes in the worldwide arabidopsis populations, which reflected their important roles in individual adaptation. the distribution of p/a genes was uneven on chromosomes and  <dig> % of them were clustered, suggesting that unequal recombination was a major mechanism for generating p/a polymorphisms. however, a high proportion of p/a genes were observed near the centromeres, which meant the generation of p/a genes was different in these regions. we also observed a varied distribution of p/a genes in different gene groups, which indicated they were under natural selection. most importantly, little geographic differentiation was found in the distribution of p/a genes among populations, implying that these genes were generated and maintained randomly at relatively high frequency. additionally, we observed a relationship between diversity and frequency of p/a genes. the high nucleotide diversity and high absent gene frequency suggested that balancing selection could be a mechanism maintaining p/a polymorphisms. this work may help us to better understand the evolutionary forces on p/a genes in arabidopsis populations as well as the mechanisms for p/a generation.
