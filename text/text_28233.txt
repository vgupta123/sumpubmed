BACKGROUND
biomineralisation is a process by which living organisms develop mineral structures to perform a variety of roles related to support, defence and feeding. amongst these, a large number of animals  mineralises by co-precipitation of calcium  and carbonates  to form a protective shell or a skeleton. the prerequisite for shell mineralisation is the supply of large amounts of ca2+ and co32- in a limited extracellular milieu by trans-cellular transport, requiring the presence of ion channels, ion pumps and ion exchangers. in gallus gallus, eggshell formation takes place daily in the hen uterus and is one of the most rapid mineralisation processes  <cit> . it requires large amount of calcium carbonate  as the hen exports the equivalent of her body weight as eggshell in one year of egg production . both elements  are not stored in the uterus but are continuously supplied during eggshell formation by the blood plasma via trans-epithelial transport taking place across the uterine glandular cells  <cit> . early studies determined the ion concentrations of the uterine fluid, which bathes the eggshell and changes during the sequential stages of calcification   <cit> , identified several proteins involved in ion transport  <cit> , and recorded changes in ion fluxes across the uterine epithelium in response to ion transporter inhibitors  <cit> . these classic approaches led to a hypothesis concerning the mechanisms of ion transfer through the uterine glandular cells . in hens, the ca2+ blood  and epithelial cell concentrations , suggest that ca2+ entry in cell is passive via a ca2+ channel, which remains unidentified. the intracellular ca2+ transport through the cell involves 28 kda calbindin  <cit> . the 28 kda calbindin expression is greatly upregulated during eggshell formation and falls after suppression of calcification , suggesting a very close relationship between uterine calbindin levels and ca2+ flux  <cit> . this protein could also take part in maintaining low intracellular ca2+ to avoid cell death as observed in other species and tissues  <cit> . ca2+ secretion from epithelial cells to the uterine fluid is active involving a ca2+ atpase, the activity of which varies with the stage of eggshell calcification  <cit> . a recent study  <cit>  identified and localized the plasma membrane ca2+ atpase isoform  <dig>  in the apical membrane of epithelial cells of king quail. the disruption of sodium  re-absorption by specific inhibitors in perfused uterus or in vitro reduced ca2+ secretion by 50%  <cit> , revealing a strong relationship between na+ and ca2+ transfers and therefore the putative presence of na+/ca2+ exchangers in uterine cells. the na+/k+ atpase responsible for na+ re-absorption in the plasma membrane is characterised and is upregulated during the period of shell calcification  <cit> . 

the eggshell precursors are secreted in the uterine fluid where the eggshell mineralization daily takes place from 10 hours to 22 hours post ovulation . po: post ovulation.

the second essential component of eggshell mineralisation is carbonate. blood carbon dioxide  is provided in cells by passive diffusion through the plasma membrane  <cit> . in the uterine tubular gland cells, a family of key enzymes, the carbonic anhydrases   <cit>  catalyses the hydration of co <dig> to hco3- as confirmed by inhibition of hco3- production and secretion by acetazolamide, a ca inhibitor  <cit> . chloride  is absorbed by the uterus and any perturbation of na+ flux by ouabain  <cit>  reverses both the na+ and cl- fluxes, but reduces also hco3- secretion suggesting that its transfer is dependent on cl- via a cl-/hco3- exchanger which has not been identified. finally, the production of hco3- in tubular gland cells and of co32- in the uterine fluid generates high levels of protons  ions. the concomitant decrease in uterine and plasma ph during calcification reflects the reabsorption of h+  <cit> .

only a few genes and related proteins involved in uterine ion transfer have been identified to date. our objective therefore was to use the recent information issuing from the chicken genome sequencing  <cit>  and subsequent enrichment in the chicken gene/protein databases to identify uterine ion transport proteins. use of a recent transcriptomic study revealing uterine genes related to eggshell calcification  <cit>  and of the analogies with transporters previously described in mammalian tissues transferring large quantities of ions  allows the identification of putative genes encoding proteins involved in uterine trans-epithelial ion transports. confirmation of their presence in birds and evaluation of their involvement have been analysed by comparing gene expression in the uterus compared to the magnum  and the duodenum , where both ca2+ and hco3- trans-epithelial transfers are respectively low and high. the magnum and the uterus secrete a large amount of water, na+ and cl- during the phase of hydration of egg albumen which takes place before the active phase of eggshell formation in the uterus  <cit> . by contrast, the duodenum is the proximal region of the intestine with a high capacity for ca2+ absorption  <cit>  and secretes a large amount of hco3- for neutralization of gastric acidity  <cit> . an additional experimental approach was the comparison of gene expression in the uterus isolated from hens at the stage of eggshell formation, to those for which eggshell formation was suppressed by premature egg expulsion. we identified a large number of genes coding for ion transport and propose a general model describing the putative contribution and localisation of the ion transporters in the tubular gland cell of the hen’s uterus.

RESULTS
identification of uterine ion transporters
the first step of this work was to establish a list of ion transporters potentially involved in supplying eggshell minerals. the ion transfer model established in the gallus gallus uterus  using physiological data  <cit>  was used to produce a first list of genes encoding ionic transporter proteins. this approach was completed by using a recent transcriptomic study revealing genes overexpressed in the uterus  compared to the magnum   <cit>  and analogies with transporters previously described in mammalian tissues at the intestinal and kidney level  <cit> . a list of  <dig> genes was therefore selected as candidates possibly involved in uterine trans-epithelial ion transfers . to facilitate identification of candidates in the manuscript, we have only used the gene symbol for describing both genes and proteins. 

uterine expression of the  <dig> genes encoding ion transporters
the mrna expression of  <dig> transporters was analysed by rt-pcr in the uterus, and three other ion secreting or absorbing epithelia  and in muscle where no trans-epithelial ion transfer occurs . amongst these  <dig> genes, mrna expression was observed in the uterus for  <dig> genes. three genes , two exchangers na+ dependent  or independent  cl-/hco3- were not expressed in the uterus and were not further studied.

a large majority of these  <dig> genes were also revealed in the duodenum. conversely, slc4a <dig> was expressed only in duodenum. four genes were revealed only in the uterus and were not present in the magnum  or in muscle . the  <dig> genes revealed in the uterus are candidates for supplying ions in the uterus.

comparative expression of ion transfer genes between uterus and other secreting tissues
the expression of the  <dig> genes encoding proteins potentially involved in uterine ion transfer were quantitatively evaluated by comparing their gene expression in the uterus to those of two other tissues  where ca2+ and hco3- trans-epithelial transport are at low and high levels, respectively. after normalisation, the fold changes in gene expression between uterus vs magnum and uterus vs duodenum was statistically analysed .

amongst the  <dig> comparisons of gene expression between the uterus and the magnum, only one gene  was not differentially expressed. the  <dig> other genes showed higher levels of gene expression in the uterus than in the magnum . amongst these  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes  are not differentially expressed between uterus and duodenum suggesting they are equally important in both tissues able to absorb or secrete large amounts of ca2+ and hco3-. these  <dig> gene candidates suspected to be involved in uterine ionic transfer corresponded to:

 ca2+ transfer: trpv ca2± channel , calbindin 28 kda , endoplasmic ca2± pump type  <dig> and  <dig> , inositol trisphosphate receptor type  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> , ca2± pumps pmca type  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and ca2±/na± exchanger type  <dig>   <dig> .

 na+ transfer: amiloride-sensitive na+ channel subunit α, β, and γ , na±/k± transporting atpase subunit α and β , ca2±/na± exchanger type  <dig> and  <dig> , several na±/hco3- co-transporters .

 k+ transfer: na±/k± transporting atpase subunit α and β  and several k± channels .

 hco3- production and transfer: cas type  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  , an hco3-/cl- exchanger , and several na±/hco3- co-transporters .

 h+ transfer: vh± atpase pump subunit b , and cl-/h+ exchanger .

 cl- transfer: cftr channel , cl- channel protein  <dig> , an hco3-/cl- exchanger  and a cl-/h+ exchanger .

fourteen genes amongst the  <dig> were overexpressed in the uterus compared with the duodenum. this overexpression of transporters in the uterus relative to the duodenum is indicative of genes whose function is more uterine specific. they corresponded to:

 ca2+ transfer: endoplasmic ca2+ pump type  <dig> , inositol trisphosphate receptors , ca2+ pumps pmca <dig>  and ca2+/na+ exchanger type  <dig> .

 na+ transfer: amiloride-sensitive na+ channel subunit α, β, and γ , ca2+/na+ exchanger type  <dig> , na+/hco3- co-transporters .

 k+ transfer: several k+ channels .

 hco3- production and transfer: na+/hco3- co-transporters .

 cl- transfer: cl- channel protein  <dig>  and cftr channel .

three genes are underexpressed in the uterus compared with the duodenum suggesting that their function is more specific to the duodenum:

 ca2+ transfer: ca2+ pumps pmca <dig> .

 hco3- production and transfer: ca type  <dig> .

 h+ transfer and  cl- transfer: h+/cl- exchanger .

comparative expression of genes in the presence or absence of eggshell formation
this model was explored to reveal regulation of gene expression associated with the process of shell formation and to discern some of the ionic transport proteins more likely to be involved in supplying shell mineral precursors. we compared expression of these genes in the uterus when calcification takes place or after its suppression due to premature expulsion of the eggs for 3– <dig> consecutive days. the early egg expulsion eliminates the ca2+ and hco3- requirement for shell formation, and eliminates the mechanical stimulation of the uterine wall due to the presence of the egg, which is known to upregulate expression of certain genes. fold changes in gene expression between the calcifying or inactive uterus are presented in figure <dig> 

twelve genes amongst  <dig> were overexpressed in the presence of eggshell calcification compared to hens in which shell formation had been suppressed :

 ca+2+ transfer: 28 kda calbindin , endoplasmic ca2+ pump type  <dig> , and ca2+ pumps pmca <dig> .

 na+ transfer: amiloride-sensitive na+ channel subunit γ  and na+/k+ transporting atpase subunit α .

 k+ transfer: na+/k+ transporting atpase subunit α  and the k+ channels .

 hco3- production and transfer: carbonic anhydrase ca type  <dig> , an hco3-/cl- exchanger .

 cl- transfer: the cl- channel  and an hco3-/cl- exchanger .

in contrast,  <dig> genes corresponding to a ca2+/h+ exchanger  and to a na+/hco3- co-transporter  showed an underexpression when eggshell calcification takes place.

nineteen of the  <dig> uterine genes did not show any fold change between these two physiological conditions:

 ca2+ transfer: trpv ca2+ channel , endoplasmic ca2+ pump type  <dig> , inositol trisphosphate receptors , and ca2+/na+ exchanger type  <dig> and  <dig> .

 na+ transfer: amiloride-sensitive na+ channel subunit α and γ , na+/k+ transporting atpase subunit β , ca2+/na+ exchanger type  <dig> and  <dig> , na+/hco3- co-transporters .

 k+ transfer: na+/k+ transporting atpase subunit β  and a k+ channel .

 hco3- production and transfer: ca type  <dig>   <dig> , several na+/hco3- co-transporters .

 cl- transfer: cl- channel protein  <dig>  and h+/cl- exchanger .

 h+ transfer: vh+ atpase pump subunit b  and h+/cl- exchanger .

discussion
eggshell calcification in the avian uterus is one of the fastest mineralisation processes in the living world. the ca2+ metabolism is intense in gallus gallus hens which export a large amount of ca2+  and consequently there are numerous physiological adaptations to support this function  <cit> . in fact, an egg-producing hen shows a specific appetite for ca2+ a few hours before shell calcification is initiated and its capacity to absorb ca2+ in the intestine increases by 6-fold due to large stimulation of the active metabolite of vitamin d at the kidney level. the uterus acquires the capacity to transfer a great quantity of ca2+ and hco3- for supplying mineral precursors of the eggshell during less than 14 hours. this model is therefore particularly relevant to explore the mechanisms of mineral transport needed for the extracellular biomineralisation of the eggshell. in this study, we focused on intracellular ionic transporters and did not explore the proteins involved in their regulation. this process has been the object of many physiological and pharmacological works as reviewed by nys  <cit>  and bar  <cit> . however, the molecular identification of ionic transporters remains incomplete in the uterus. genome sequencing in human and other mammalian species has contributed to the molecular identification of genes and related proteins involved in ionic trans-epithelial transfer in the intestine and kidneys  <cit> . by using this literature and data provided by a recent high throughput analysis of chicken uterine genes related to eggshell calcification  <cit> , we identified  <dig> putative genes encoding ion trans-epithelial transporters and tested their involvement in providing mineral precursors in the hen’s uterus. analysis of their expression by rt-pcr, showed that  <dig> of these genes were expressed at the uterine level. in order to study their involvement in providing both ca2+ and hco3- for eggshell formation, the expression of these  <dig> genes in the uterus was quantified by qrt-pcr and compared with two other epithelia  where ca2+ and hco3- transfers are respectively low and high. in addition, the expression of these genes was compared in the uterus during two situations: during eggshell calcification and when ca2+ and hco3- secretions were suppressed due to premature egg expulsion. these approaches allowed the identification of numerous transporting proteins providing minerals for shell formation in the hen’s uterus.

ca2+ transfer
ca2+ is not stored in the uterus before eggshell calcification but comes from blood plasma by trans-epithelial transport. this ca2+ export is extremely rapid during calcification and corresponds to a consumption of the total plasmatic ca2+ pool every 12 min. studies of ca2+ transfer in vivo using perfusion of uterus  <cit>  and in vitro exploring the effects of inhibitors of ion atpases or carbonic anhydrase  <cit> , and ionic analysis of uterine fluid during eggshell formation  <cit> , made it possible to build a first model of ca2+ transfer in the uterus : ca2+, hco3- secretion and na+ reabsorption was considered to occur against their electrochemical gradient, to involve active intracellular transfer as shown by specific inhibitors  <cit>  and to occur in the uterine glandular cells as revealed by immunohistochemistry of transport proteins  <cit> . trans-epithelial transfer of ca2+ occurs in three steps as observed in all transporting epithelia: ca2+ influx through a downhill gradient, an intracellular ca2+ transport involving calbindin 28 kda protein  <cit>  and active output into the lumen through a ca2+ pump  <cit> . the high plasma ca2+ concentration  relative to the uterine cell interior   suggests that the ca2+ entry into cells passively occurs via ca2+ selective channels present in the basolateral plasma membrane. in other tissues, such as intestine, kidney and plasma, trpvs  <dig>   <dig>  are epithelial channels that represent the principal pathway for ca2+ uptake into the cell  <cit> . our study showed that in gallus gallus, only one gene  is present. this channel is significantly overexpressed in the uterus compared with the magnum, where ca2+ transfer is low. its uterine expression is similar to that of the duodenum where ca2+ absorption is also large. cellular ca2+ influx might use a similar ca2+ channel, trpv <dig>  at the intestinal and uterine level but their localisation is hypothesized to differ according to the site of ca2+ influx, being located in the basal membrane in the uterus but in the apical membrane in the intestine. the uterine expression of trpv <dig> is not however modified according to whether calcification takes place. the presence of other ca2+ channels cannot be ruled out as additional putative candidates. a recent transcriptomic study in our laboratory comparing uterine gene expression in hens with or without shell calcification revealed the presence of high expression of trpc <dig>  trpp, trpm <dig>  trpml <dig> and orai  <dig> .

an intracellular ca2+ buffer is crucial to keep the free cytosolic ca2+ concentration below toxic levels. following ca2+ entry into the uterine glandular cell, several systems could contribute to intracellular transport of ca2+, while maintaining the low but essential free ca2+ concentration for survival of the cell. in certain tissues, calbindin proteins, 9 kda and 28 kda in mammals  <cit>  or 28 kda in birds  <cit> , are present at high cytosolic concentration and possess high ca2+ binding capacity. direct correlation has been demonstrated between their mucosal concentration and the efficiency of ca2+ transfer in intestine and uterus under numerous experimental conditions  <cit> . it is generally accepted that calbindins facilitate the diffusion of intracellular ca2+ and serve as a ca2+ buffer needed for cell protection against ca2+ stress and accompanying apoptotic cellular degradation that is induced by a high intracellular ca2+ concentration  <cit> . in our study, we observed an elevated expression of calbindin 28 kda in the uterus during calcification of an eggshell compared to the magnum  and compared to the uterus with no shell in formation  in agreement with previous studies  <cit> . this uterine calbindin 28 kda is therefore associated with intracellular ca2+ transport from the basal membrane of the glandular cells to the apical membrane where ca2+ is extruded into the uterine fluid.

an alternative system in mammals to maintain a low intracellular ca2+ concentration relies on the endoplasmic reticulum which contributes to ca2+ homeostasis through its capacity for ca2+ uptake and storage  <cit> . the endoplasmic reticulum ca2+ atpases  play an active role in ca2+ uptake by this organelle , while maintaining the cytoplasmic concentration at low concentrations of 10-4 mm free ca2+. amongst the three isoenzymes , only atp2a <dig> and atp2a <dig> were overexpressed in the uterus compared to the magnum. the absence of atp2a <dig> expression fits with its predominant localisation in mammalian muscle in contrast to atp2a <dig> and atp2a <dig> which are expressed in numerous tissues  <cit> . the overexpression of atp2a <dig> in the uterus compared to duodenum suggests a more crucial role of this transporter, the regulation of which remained to be explored.

the inositol  <dig>   <dig>  5-trisphosphate receptors  are intracellular ca2+ channels, localised mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit>  and allowing the release of ca2+ from this organelle. the three isoforms  were overexpressed in the uterus compared to the magnum but were not modified when comparing the presence or absence of calcification. the higher expression of itpr <dig> and itpr  <dig> in the uterus compared to the duodenum supports our hypothesis concerning their contribution to the regulation of intra-cellular ca2+. the ryanodine receptors which are involved in muscle excitation-contraction coupling in mammalian tissues  <cit>  are alternative channels for ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. ryr <dig> expression was revealed in the uterus, but there was no difference between the uterus, magnum or duodenum, suggesting a weak involvement in endoplasmic reticulum ca2+ release. in conclusion, these observations of high expression of genes encoding atp2a pumps and itpr ca2+ channels involved in ca2+ uptake and release in endoplasmic reticulum suggest the involvement of this organelle in intracellular ca2+ buffering in uterine glandular cells.

the last step of uterine ca2+ trans-epithelial transport is output from the glandular cells, which occurs against a concentration gradient. ca2+ secretion towards the uterine fluid occurs via an active process, involving the ca2+ atpase  <cit> . this has recently been associated with the pmca <dig>   <cit> . four isoenzymes  of pmcas pumps are identified in mammals  <cit> . only three  are conserved in birds. each of these were overexpressed in the uterus compared to the magnum . atp2b <dig> was also overexpressed in the uterus compared to the duodenum, and in presence of the eggshell mineralisation  suggesting a more active role in ca2+ secretion at the uterine level. in contrast, atp2b <dig> and atp2b <dig> were underexpressed in the uterus compared to duodenum and for atp2b <dig> in presence of shell formation. in mammals, it is atp2b <dig> which plays a more important role in intestinal ca2+ absorption  <cit> . in other bird species, parker et al.  <cit>  localized the plasma membrane ca2+-transporting atpase  <dig>  in the apical membrane of uterine epithelial cells but did not explore the presence of atp2b <dig> and its differential expression during calcification. in human osteoblasts, the isoforms  <dig> and  <dig> take part in the ca2+ supply necessary for bone mineralisation whereas the isoform  <dig> is not detected  <cit> .

it was observed thirty years ago that the inhibition of na+ transfer by na+/k+ atpase inhibitors considerably reduced ca2+ secretion into the uterine lumen  <cit> , showing a coupling between uterine ca2+ secretion and na+ re-absorption. the uterine absorption of na+ is revealed by the decreased na+ concentrations in the uterine fluid observed between the early stage of shell calcification and the end of calcification . these observations support the hypothesis that na+/ca2+ exchangers participate in the uterine ca2+ secretion. the role of these transporters is clearly established at the mammalian intestinal and renal level  <cit> . our study supported this mechanism for ca2+ secretion in the chicken uterus, as both na+/ca2+ exchangers  were overexpressed in the uterus compared to the magnum, whereas their expression did not change in the presence or absence of eggshell mineralisation . the mammalian exchangers allow the cell output of one ca2+ ion against three na+ ions at the basolateral membrane level. this transport is facilitated by the na+ gradient, which provides the energy necessary for the ca2+ output against its gradient  <cit> . similarly, the respective na+ gradient between the cell  and the uterine fluid  may provide the bird uterus with the energy needed for the ca2+ output towards the uterine fluid at the apical membrane of the glandular cells. conversely, the unfavourable gradient of na+ concentrations between blood  and glandular cells at the basal membrane level will prevent ca2+ uptake in the cells by exchange with na+. both na+/ca2+ exchangers  are therefore predicted to be present only in the apical membrane of the uterine glandular cells. the co-expression of the slc8a <dig> and  <dig> genes and of atp2bx is observed in numerous ca2+ transporting epithelia  <cit>  but their respective involvements in ca2+ flux has been questioned. na+/ca2+ exchangers have a weak affinity for ca2+, but strong ca2+ conductance. on the other hand, the ca2+ atp2bx pumps have a strong affinity for ca2+, but a weaker conductance  <cit> . these data suggest that ca2+ transport is mainly assured by the na+/ca2+ exchangers. in the hen uterus, the inhibition of the na+/k+ atpase led to a 60% decrease in ca2+ transport in vitro or during uterine perfusion  <cit> . this observation underlines the importance of the na+/ca2+ exchangers in the avian uterus.

the information on uterine ca2+ transport is summarized in the model described in figure <dig> 

na+ transfer
during eggshell calcification, na+ is absorbed from the uterine fluid into the blood plasma. this absorption resulting from the predominance of apical to basolateral flux relative to basolateral to apical flux, is partly due to the presence of the na+/ca2+ exchangers , but a complementary system has been demonstrated by using epithelial na+ channel blockers  <cit> . amiloride-sensitive na+ channels are essential in various epithelia  <cit> . three subunits  of the na+ channel are overexpressed in the uterus compared to the magnum and to the duodenum , suggesting the involvement of these transporters in na+ uptake by the uterine glandular cells at the apical membrane. the γ subunit  was overexpressed during shell calcification in contrast to the α and β subunits  suggesting its predominant involvement in the uterus.

in the basolateral membrane, the na+ glandular cell output towards plasma is active and occurs against a large electrochemical gradient . this is provided by the na+/k+ atpase, which is crucial in all animals for actively transporting na+ out and k+ into the cell, and for maintaining the membrane potential and active transport of other solutes in intestine, kidney or placenta  <cit> . its presence in the avian uterus and crucial role in ionic transfer during shell formation has been demonstrated  <cit> . in situ hybridization in the chicken uterus  <cit>  showed that only the α <dig> subunit of na+/k+ atpase , is present in the uterus whereas the α <dig> and α <dig> subunits  are absent. in this study, the α <dig> subunit , but also the β <dig> subunit of na+/k+ atpase , were overexpressed in the uterus compared to the magnum. we also confirmed the overexpression of α <dig> subunit of na+/k+ atpase during the phase of calcification in contrast to the β1subunit of na+/k+ atpase, in agreement with lavelin et al.  <cit> .

the possibility of an uptake of na+ from plasma into the uterine glandular cells at the basal membrane via na+/hco3- co-transporters  is discussed in the section addressing hco3- transfer.

k+ secretion
in the gastrointestinal or kidney epithelia, k+ channels provide the driving force for electrogenic transport processes across membranes and are involved in cell volume regulation or in secretory and reabsorptive processes. k+ channels are crucial for maintenance of body homeostasis and form the largest group of ion channels in mammals as more than one hundred thirty genes have been identified in human  <cit> . the chicken database revealed more than  <dig> such genes in birds. we explored only a limited number of k+ channel candidates in chicken uterus by selecting 4 k+ channels overexpressed in uterus compared to their expression in magnum, as revealed in our hen transcriptomic study  <cit> . the increased k+ concentrations in uterine fluid between early  and late stages of calcification , demonstrates that uterine k+ net flow corresponds to a secretion into uterine fluid. a portion of k+ secretion might be associated with the passive component of water secretion which occurs during the egg plumping at the early stage of shell calcification  but no experimental data has explored this contribution through a putative paracellular pathway. k+ uptake at the basolateral membrane, from the blood plasma towards the uterine glandular cells, should result from activities of the na+/k+ atpases . by analogy with other intestinal, kidney, pancreatic, placenta, mammary glands or blood cells, we expect that k+ channels present in the glandular cell will recycle k+ to allow functioning of the active na+/k+ atpases. we tested  <dig> genes: three coding k+ channels  and one k+ large conductance ca2+ activated channel , which could be involved in k+ cell output . the kcnj <dig>   <dig>   <dig> channels belong to the kcnj family  which are stimulated by external k+ concentration. their expressions are observed in numerous epithelia where k+ secretion occurs  <cit> . the kcnms  participate in k+ output in a large range of tissues and epithelia and are regulated by ca2+ cellular levels  <cit> . our results showed that the expression of kcnj <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and kcnma <dig> k+ channels were higher in the uterus compared with the magnum. moreover, the expression of kcnj <dig>   <dig> and kcnma <dig>  was stimulated during calcification . these results showed that kcnj <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and kcnm k+ channels are involved in the maintenance of potential membrane and k+ recycling during eggshell calcification and have therefore been introduced in the model . we propose to localize them in the apical membrane but we have no evidence that they are absent from the basolateral membranes. 

hco3- production and transfer
eggshell mineralisation results from the co-precipitation of ca2+ and hco3-. the bicarbonate precursor of the eggshell calcite is mainly derived from the blood carbon dioxide  which penetrates the uterine glandular cells by simple diffusion through the plasma membrane  <cit> . carbonic anhydrases   <cit>  catalyse the hydration of intracellular co <dig> to hco3-, which is secreted into the uterine fluid. in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, including pancreas, the cellular and membrane bound cas are key enzymes allowing secretion or reabsorption of large amount of acid across the mucosa or protect epithelial cells from acid injury by secreting bicarbonate  <cit> . in all mammalian species, the duodenum buffers gastric acid secretion by producing intracellular hco3- from co <dig> at a higher rate than the stomach or distal small intestine. the co <dig> originates from intestinal lumen at the duodenal level but is provided from blood plasma via the respiratory system to the uterine tissue  <cit> . this study showed a larger expression of the cytosolic ca <dig> and  <dig> and of the membrane bound ca <dig> in the chicken uterus than in magnum . no difference in expression was observed between the uterus and the duodenum for ca <dig> and  <dig>  cytoplasmic ca <dig> is the predominant ca in the duodenum, playing a major function in the hydration of co <dig> to produce hco3-  <cit> . similarly, we propose that ca <dig> plays a major role in the uterus to provide the carbonate precursor for the eggshell. ca <dig> is significantly underexpressed in the uterus compared to the duodenum, suggesting a secondary rule in hco3- uterine production. a major role for ca <dig> is supported by the overexpression of this ca gene in the presence of eggshell mineralisation, in contrast to ca <dig> and  <dig> .

the hco3- produced by ca <dig> in uterine glandular cells must be then secreted into the uterine fluid to build the eggshell. in mammalian pancreas  <cit>  and in duodenum  <cit>  which secrete large amounts of hco3- towards the lumen, anion hco3-/cl- exchangers  have been located in apical membrane and na+/hco3- co-transporters  at the basolateral membrane  <cit> . in the bird uterus, there is a strong association between hco3- secretion and cl- transport  <cit>  which supports the involvement of hco3-/cl- exchangers. the hco3- flow through the uterine apical membrane is an electrogenic process which is facilitated by output of intracellular cl-, via an exchanger of the slc <dig> electrogenic family  <cit> . our study confirmed the expression of a hco3-/cl- exchanger  in the uterus as shown in other epithelial cells  <cit> . slc26a <dig> is suspected to have a role in intestinal hco3- secretion, in particular to neutralise gastric acidity  <cit> . our results showed an overexpression of slc26a <dig> exchanger in the uterus compared to the magnum or when the calcification takes place, whereas no variation of expression was observed between the duodenum and the uterus . these observations suggest a common mechanism between both tissues and support the hypothesis of the involvement of this transporter in the supply of hco3- for eggshell calcification. na+/hco3- co-transporter genes  are also expressed in the uterus and likely contribute to hco3-transport. slc4a <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed higher expression in the uterus than in the magnum. an overexpression relative to the duodenum is observed only for slc4a <dig>  the three others being similarly expressed . slc4a <dig> is underexpressed in the uterus during calcification compared to its absence  suggesting that involvement of this transporter is limited during the eggshell calcification process. in mammals, na+/hco3- co-transporters mediate the electroneutral movement of na+ and hco3- across the plasma membrane  <cit> . the ionic concentrations in the plasma and uterine glandular cells  show a favourable concentration gradient for uptake of these ions, supporting the localisation of these transporters in the basolateral membrane of uterine glandular cells to allow hco3- entry. however, previous studies  <cit>  showed that the majority of hco3- used for the eggshell came from blood co <dig> and only for a minor part from plasma hco3-. na+/hco3- co-transporters  are likely to have a minor role in hco3- supply to the uterine glandular cells. the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator  contributes to fluid secretion from epithelial cells of the lung, pancreas and intestine, as shown in pathological situations associated with impaired fluid production, cl- and hco3- secretion due to defective cftr  <cit>  or in pharmacological studies of reproductive epithelium  <cit> . its contribution to hco3- secretion is unlikely because of the unfavourable gradient or it is possibly indirect through regulation of hco3- transporters  <cit> . its role as a cl- channel is discussed in the following section on cl-. studies using specific inhibitors and measuring cl- and hco3- flows are needed to quantify the contribution of hco3-/cl- exchangers in hco3- uterine secretion.

h+ transfer
hco3- production in the glandular epithelial cells, its secretion into uterine fluid and the co-precipitation of co32- with ca2+ leads to a progressive acidification of the uterine fluid and of glandular cells  <cit> . in fact, two h+ are produced for each caco <dig> formed. this metabolic acidosis is partially compensated by hyperventilation by the hen and by an increased renal h+ excretion  <cit> .

the plasma membrane ca2+ -transporting atpases  of the apical membrane actively extrude ca2+, as previously mentioned. however several lines of evidence have established that these pumps contribute to h+ re-absorption coupled to ca2+ secretion  <cit> . the present study highlights their crucial role in ca2+ secretion by uterine glandular cells during eggshell formation and therefore in h+ re-absorption from the uterine fluid through the apical membrane. alternatively, the na+/h+ exchangers have been shown to contribute to h+ output in the pancreatic duct which also secretes large amount of hco3-. in a recent transcriptomic study of the uterus , we detected expression of various na+/h+ exchangers , supporting this possibility.

in this study, rt-pcr shows that the v h+ atpase pump  is expressed in the bird uterus during calcification. in mammals, this vat complex is made up of at least  <dig> subunits and allows transfer of h+ by hydrolysis of atp  <cit> . this vat is present in many membranes of organelles and also frequently in the plasma membranes of renal cells or osteoclasts  <cit> . vat is therefore a good candidate for transferring protons to plasma in the hen uterine glandular cell, especially as this vat was revealed in other species producing caco <dig> biominerals and shown to export h+ during mineralisation  <cit> . this proton atpase extrudes h+ across the basolateral membrane of pancreatic duct epithelium  <cit>  which is secreting high amounts of hco3- using mechanisms quite similar to uterine glandular cells. our study reveals overexpression of the vat subunit b in the uterus, which transfers large amounts of h+ compared with the magnum, where limited amounts of h+ are transferred. the vat is likely to participate in h+ export from cytoplasm of the uterine cells to the blood plasma across the plasma membrane. the role of clcn <dig> in h+ transfer is discussed in the ensuing cl- section.

cl- transfer
the cl- concentrations decrease from  <dig> to 45 mm in the uterine fluid  when comparing the initial and late stage of eggshell calcification in parallel with changes of larger magnitude in na+ concentrations. the high concentration of these ions observed at the early stage of calcification might result from the large secretions of water, na+ and cl- which occurs during the plumping period ,  <dig> to 10 h after ovulation possibly through a paracellular pathway  <cit> . these water and saline secretions are completed at the initiation of the rapid phase of shell formation, when na+ and cl- net fluxes are inversed. the net flux of cl- is inhibited by acetazolamide, demonstrating the relationship between cl- transport and hco3- secretion derived from cas activity  <cit> , and the involvement of hco3-/cl- exchangers of the slc <dig> or slc <dig> family  <cit> . amongst the slc4ax hco3-/cl- exchangers, we observed no expression of slc4a <dig> and there is no evidence of any expression of slc4a <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> in avian uterine transcriptomic study  <cit> . the role of slc26a <dig> exchanger was previously discussed in the hco3- section. this exchanger is predicted to be located in the apical membrane of the uterine glandular cells and to contribute to cl- cell uptake during eggshell calcification as suggested in hens subjected to acetazolamide inhibitors  <cit>  or in other species  <cit> .

the clcn <dig> channel, a family member of the clcn , is relatively ubiquitous in epithelial cells and other cellular types  <cit> . it is considered to participate in various functions such as cellular volume regulation  <cit> , cardiac activity regulation  <cit>  and cl- trans-epithelial transfer  <cit> . our study revealed that the clcn <dig> channel is overexpressed in the uterus compared to the magnum or the duodenum . the uterine fluid  and intracellular  cl- concentrations are favourable to a cl- passive entry in uterine glandular cells. in parallel, another cl- channel, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator  could also contribute to cl- entry in the cell as observed in numerous tissues  <cit> . in the chicken uterus, the cftr channel is expressed at a higher level than in the magnum and the duodenum . it is also overexpressed in the uterus during eggshell calcification . the clcn <dig> and cftr channel are therefore probably expressed in the apical membrane and might contribute to cl- entry in the cell.

on the other hand, cl- output could be carried out by clcn <dig>  another member of clcn family. renal proximal tubule cells highly express the v h+ atpase for acidification of endosomes and electroneutrality is ensured by transfer of cl- by clcn <dig>  <cit> . the clcn <dig> h+/cl- exchanger  <cit>  has been localised mainly in organelle membranes but also in the plasma membrane. our study revealed an overexpression of clcn <dig> h+/cl- in the uterus compared to the magnum, so this channel might contribute to cl- output through the basal membrane. an alternative would be that cl- output relies on cation-coupled cotransport as observed in fish or mammals. the slc <dig> family consists of na+-k+-2cl- cotransporters and of k+-cl- electroneutral cotransporters, and are expressed either in kidney where they contribute to salt reabsorption, or more ubiquitously being involved in cell volume regulation  <cit> . in the chicken uterus, one na+-k+-2cl- cotransporter  and 4 k+-cl- cotransporters  are putative candidate, as expression of these genes is revealed in the chicken uterus transcriptome . in addition, furosemide, a blocker of na+-k+-2cl- cotransporters, has been shown to decrease egg shell thickness  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
initial studies on ion transfer in the uterus using physiological and pharmacological approaches provided a preliminary model of ion transfer contributing to the uterine ca2+ and hco3- necessary for shell mineralisation   <cit> . the current approaches using knowledge gleaned from the chicken genome sequence and uterine transcriptomic expression data  <cit>  identified numerous genes encoding putative transporters supplying the mineral precursors of eggshell mineralisation. we have used this information to build a model describing the ion supply mechanisms in the uterus, following a logical sequence for ion transfers for secretion of large amounts of ca2+ and hco3- to form the eggshell . this work identified  <dig> genes and related proteins involved in this process. it is consistent with preliminary hypotheses. our analysis also revealed that analogies exist in the mechanisms of hco3- secretion by pancreatic duct cells and by duodenum, and to a lower extent with intestinal epithelial cells for ca2+ movement, even if the ca2+ flux is reversed between both uterus and duodenum.

the main steps of ion transfer in the hen’s uterus can be summarised :

 ca2+ secretion through epithelial glandular cells involves trpv <dig> ca2+ channel in the basolateral membrane , 28 kda calbindin , endoplasmic ca2+ pumps type  <dig>   <dig> , and inositol trisphosphate receptors type  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> . ca2+ is then extruded from the glandular cells by the membrane’s ca2+ pumps  and ca2+/na+ exchangers . the endoplasmic ca2+ pumps, inositol trisphosphate receptors, and 28 kda calbindin contribute to maintain a low intracellular free ca2+ concentration essential for cell survival.

 na+ transport involves three na+ channels , na+/ca2+ exchangers slc8a <dig> and  <dig>  and the na+/k+ atpase .

 k+ uptake entry into the cell results from the na+/k+ atpase; the k+ channels  contribute to its output release at the apical membrane.

 hco3- is mainly produced from co <dig> by ca <dig> and to a lesser extent by ca <dig>  and is also provided at a low level from plasma by the na+/hco3+ co-transporters . hco3- is exported from the cell through the hco3-/cl- exchanger slc26a <dig> 

 hco3- synthesis in the cell and co-precipitation of hco3- with ca2+ in the uterine fluid produces two h+ which are transferred to plasma via the membrane ca2+ pumps atp2b <dig>   <dig> in the apical membrane and the vat pump at the basolateral level.

 cl- ions in the uterine fluid enter the cell by the hco3-/cl- exchanger slc26a <dig> and by cl- channels , and might be extruded by cl-/h+ exchanger , but also by na+-k+-2cl- and k+-cl- cotransporters .

this model proposes a large but not exhaustive list of ionic transfer proteins involved in the supply of ca2+ and hco3- or in maintaining cellular homeostasis . the model qualitatively describes putative mechanisms and cellular localisation of the candidates. these hypotheses relying on expression of the genes and on analogies with other tissues that transfer large amount of ions, need to be confirmed using immunochemistry for their cell localisation or by specific inhibition, to establish their relative contribution and understand their interaction and regulation. this avian model where huge amounts of ca2+ and hco3- are exported daily following a precise spatial and temporal sequence should contribute to understanding the mechanism and regulation of ionic precursors of caco <dig> and provide insight for other species secreting a caco <dig> biomineral such as coral, molluscs, foraminifera or sea urchins.
