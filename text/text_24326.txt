BACKGROUND
interactions between nucleic acids and proteins have diverse functions within a cell, and play an important role in many biological processes. for example, proteins that bind to specific regions of dna act as transcription factors by activating or repressing gene expression of the dna. thus, identifying protein recognition parts in dnas or dna recognition parts in proteins will help understand a variety of cellular processes  <cit> . as many structures of protein-dna complexes have been determined, theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted in recent years to study protein-dna interactions, but protein-dna interactions and their mechanisms are not yet fully understood.

several computational methods have been developed to predict dna- or rna-binding residues in protein sequences using machine learning methods such as support vector machines  as classifiers. bindn  <cit>  uses svm to predict rna- or dna-binding residues in proteins based on the biochemical features of amino acids. dp-bind  <cit>  predicts dna-binding residues in proteins and uses svm with a position specific scoring matrix  and amino acid properties. dnabindr  <cit>  uses a naïve bayes classifier to predict dna-binding residues in proteins. metadbsite  <cit>  predicts dna-binding residues by integrating the prediction results from six predictors . a method developed by liu et al.  <cit>  predicts rna-binding sites in proteins using a random forest. it uses several features such as mutual interaction propensity, physicochemical characteristics, hydrophobicity, relative accessible surface area, secondary structure, conservation score and side-chain environment.

instead of finding dna-binding sites in proteins, some works have attempted to classify whether a given protein is dna-binding or non-binding. idna-prot  <cit>  classifies proteins into dna-binding and non-binding proteins from amino acid sequence data. dbppred  <cit>  also classifies whether a given protein is a dna-binding protein or not using secondary structure, relative solvent accessibility and pssm.

several studies have been conducted to find effective features of proteins in predicting dna-binding sites in proteins. for example, yi et al.  <cit>  characterized dna-binding residues on protein surface with b-factors and packing density, and dey et al.  <cit>  investigated evolutionary conservation, spatial clustering, hydrogen bond donor capability and residue propensity.

unlike the previous works that have focused on dna- or rna- binding proteins, in the present work we attempted to predict protein binding nucleotides using sequence data. predicting protein binding sites in dna is more difficult than predicting dna binding sites in proteins for several reasons:  for a sequence of the same length, dna has many fewer sequence patterns than protein,  in protein-dna interactions nucleotides show less diverse interaction propensities than amino acids, and  predicting binding sites in a double-stranded molecule  is more complicated than predicting binding sites in a single protein sequence.

in the present work we studied key features of dna and protein sequences and their representation to predict protein binding sites in dna. we developed two svm models and compared their performances with actual data. one svm model  predicts binding sites in a given dna sequence with unknown protein. another svm model  predicts binding sites in a given dna sequence with a specified protein. experimental results showed that the svm model that used dna sequence data alone predicted more binding sites than the svm model that used both dna and protein sequences, but the overall performance of the latter was higher than that of the former. in this paper, we present our approach to the problem of predicting protein binding nucleotides from sequence data and discuss experimental results.

methods
definition of a binding site
several types of interactions are involved in protein-dna interactions, and different studies use different criteria to define a binding site in protein-dna interactions  <cit> . in this study of protein-dna interactions, we considered three types of interactions to define a binding site: hydrogen bonds, water bridges and hydrophobic interactions. we obtained protein-dna pairs involved in the three types of interactions from the nucleic acid-protein interaction database   <cit> . a nucleotide participating in any of the interactions of three types were classified as a binding site as shown in figure  <dig> 

dataset
we collected protein-dna complexes which are determined by x-ray crystallography with a resolution of  <dig>  Å or better from the protein data bank   <cit> . as of july  <dig>  there were  <dig>  protein-dna complexes which contain  <dig>  dna sequences and  <dig> protein sequences.

we divided the  <dig>  dna sequences into two groups using cd-hit-est  <cit> .  <dig>  dna sequences with the similarity of 80% or higher were selected as a training dataset for the prediction models. the remaining  <dig> dna sequences that have a similarity lower than 80% with any sequence of the training dataset were used as a test dataset for the prediction models. we applied the feature vector-based method to the  <dig>  dna sequences to construct a non-redundant training dataset. the feature vector-based redundancy removal method, developed in our previous study  <cit> , constructs a larger training dataset of non-redundant data than the standard sequence similarity-based reduction method. the initial  <dig>  dna sequences of the training dataset form  <dig>  interaction pairs with  <dig> protein sequences, and the  <dig> dna sequences of the test dataset form  <dig> interaction pairs with  <dig> protein sequences.

our prediction models do not assume that the structure data or sequence direction is known, so they handle each sequence in double stranded dna molecules separately to predict protein-binding sites in the dna sequence. the training dataset for the model that uses both dna and protein sequences contains  <dig>  binding nucleotides and  <dig>  non-binding nucleotides. for the model that uses only dna sequence data, binding sites in a same dna sequence with different protein partners were incorporated in the dna sequence. thus, the training dataset for this model contains fewer binding and non-binding nucleotides  than that for the model that uses both dna and protein sequences.

support vector machines and feature vectors
we implemented two prediction models using a library for support vector machines   <cit> . as a kernel function we used the radial basis function . two parameters  of rbf control the performance and time-cost. we found the best values of the parameters cost and gamma for each window size using an optimization tool called grid.py. we assigned binding nucleotides a weight of  <dig>  to balance the data size of binding nucleotides with that of non-binding nucleotides.

since svm handles numerical data, we encode sequence information into a feature vector with numerical elements. we created feature values from three types of sequence data: original dna sequence, dna sequence fragments from the original dna sequence, and protein sequence interacting with the dna. the original dna sequence is represented by its base composition. dna sequence fragments are represented by nucleotide triplet composition, normalized position, molecular mass, molecular pka and interaction propensity  of nucleotide triplets  <cit> . for protein, which is an interaction partner of dna, we represent the sum of normalized position of  <dig> amino acids  <cit>  and dipeptide composition  <cit> .

the base composition represents the percentage of four nucleotides in a dna sequence . the nucleotide triplet com-position represents the frequency of a nucleotide triplet using a sequence encoding scheme called the n-gram extraction method  <cit> . for a given sequence, the n-gram method extracts the patterns and frequencies of n consecutive nucleotides. there are  <dig>  possible nucleotide triplets, and they are represented by  <dig> features in a feature vector using equation  <dig>  the ip represents the binding propensities between nucleotide triplets and amino acids. the normalized position of the i-th nucleotide or amino acid is its relative position in the original sequence .

the dipeptide composition is the frequency of  <dig>  amino acid duplet patterns  <cit> . the partner feature represents the sum of the normalized positions of  <dig> amino acids .

a feature vector representing a sequence fragment of length s consists of  <dig> elements for the base composition, s elements for mass, s elements for pka,  <dig> element for the normalized position,  <dig> elements for the triplet composition and 20×s elements for the ip of nucleotide triplets. for example, a dna sequence fragment of  <dig> nucleotides is encoded by  <dig> feature elements . in addition,  <dig> feature elements  are included in a feature vector to represent a partner protein sequence for dpi <dig> as shown in part b of figure  <dig>

a dna sequence is represented by overlapping sequence fragments using a sliding window method. part a of figure  <dig> shows the process of dividing sequences with a dna sequence of length  <dig> and sliding window of size  <dig>  after we represented the sequence fragments, we removed redundant feature vectors using the feature vector-based redundancy reduction method, which was developed in our previous study  <cit> .

RESULTS
performance measures
we performed a 10-fold cross validation to train and test the prediction models. for a more rigorous evaluation, we tested them on independent datasets that were not used in training them. the performance of the prediction models was evaluated with respect to six measures: sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and matthews correlation coefficient.

sensitivity  is the ratio of correctly predicted binding nucleotides to actual binding nucleotides . specificity  is the ratio of correctly predicted non-binding nucleotides to actual non-binding nucleotides . accuracy  is the ratio of correctly predicted nucleotides to all nucleotides . positive predictive value  measures the ratio of correctly predicted binding nucleotides to all nucleotides that are predicted as binding . negative predictive value  measures the ratio of correctly predicted non-binding nucleotides to all nucleotides that are predicted as non-binding . the matthews correlation coefficient  is a strong indicator for multi-class problems and returns a score between - <dig> and  <dig> .

sensitivity, specificity and accuracy do not provide reliable performance indicators for imbalanced data. for example, consider a data set of  <dig> positives and  <dig>  negatives which shows a sensitivity of 67%, a specificity of 91% and an accuracy of 91%. if it has nine times more false positives than true positives, the positive predictive value  can be as low as 10% despite the seemingly reasonable values of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. thus, we compute ppv and negative predictive value  in addition to sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.

in equations 6- <dig>  the true positives  are binding nucleotides that are correctly predicted as binding nucleotides, the true negatives  are non-binding nucleotides that are predicted as non-binding nucleotides, the false positives  are non-binding nucleotides that are incorrectly predicted as binding nucleotides, and the false negatives  are binding nucleotides that are incorrectly predicted as non-binding nucleotides.

comparison of two svm models
we performed a 10-fold cross validation for the two prediction models with various window sizes from  <dig> to  <dig> to examine the effect of window sizes on the prediction performance. as shown in table  <dig>  the prediction model that used both dna and protein sequences  showed better performance than the model that used only a dna sequence . dpi <dig> showed the best result with a window of size  <dig> . dpi <dig> showed the best result with a window of size  <dig> .

in the test on an independent dataset that were not used in training, dpi <dig> showed a lower sensitivity than dpi <dig>  but the other measures were higher than those of dpi <dig> . in the test on the independent dataset, dpi <dig> showed the best result with a window of size  <dig> . in the test on the independent dataset, dpi <dig> showed the best result with a window of size  <dig> .

pnimodeler takes dna sequence data as input. when pnimodeler is given a single dna sequence instead of double-stranded dna sequences as input, it can automatically generate its reverse complement sequence based on the base pairing rule and predict protein-binding nucleotides in both the input dna and its reverse complement sequences. as an optional input data, pnimodeler takes a protein sequence that interacts with the dna. figure  <dig> shows an example of predicting protein binding sites in a double-stranded dna.

several programs have been developed to predict dna-binding sites in proteins, but there are very few programs available that can predict protein-binding sites in dna. promo  <cit>  is one of the few programs that predict transcription factor  binding sites in dna sequences. for comparative purposes, we tested the two models of pnimodeler  and promo on dna sequences of recent tf-dna complexes which were deposited into pdb after december  <dig> . the model dpi <dig> of pnimodeler, which used both dna and protein sequences, showed a sensitivity of  <dig> %, a specificity of  <dig> %, an accuracy of  <dig> % and an mcc of  <dig>  on average. the model dpi <dig> of pnimodeler, which used dna sequences only, showed a sensitivity of  <dig> %, a specificity of  <dig> %, an accuracy of  <dig> % and an mcc of  <dig>  on average. with all listed transcription factors as candidate binding partners of the dna sequences of the recent tf-dna complexes, promo showed a sensitivity of  <dig> %, a specificity of  <dig> %, an accuracy of  <dig> % and an mcc of  <dig>  on average. these results demonstrate that pnimodeler is better than promo with or without the information on protein sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
in general predicting protein binding sites in a double stranded molecule is more complex than predicting binding sites in single stranded molecules. we developed two svm models to predict protein binding nucleotides in dna. one model uses dna sequence data alone and predicts all potential binding sites with unknown protein partners. the other model uses both dna and protein sequences to predict protein binding nucleotides with the specific protein. in both 10-fold cross validation and independent testing, the second model that uses both dna and protein sequences achieved better performance than the first model that uses dna sequence data only.

we have implemented the svm models as a web server called pnimodeler , and it is available at http://bclab.inha.ac.kr/pnimodeler. this web server will be useful to find protein-binding sites in dna with unknown structure. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to predict protein-binding dna nucleotides with sequence data alone.
