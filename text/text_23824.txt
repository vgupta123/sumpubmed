BACKGROUND
globins are small globular proteins, usually consisting of about 140– <dig> amino acids that comprise eight α-helical segments , displaying a characteristic 3-over- <dig> α-helical sandwich structure that encloses an iron-containing heme group. vertebrate globin genes predominantly contain three exons separated by two introns inserted at highly conserved positions b <dig>   and g <dig>  . organisms can express multiple globin molecules that have variant properties and functions. vertebrates typically express haemoglobin in red blood cells, myoglobin in muscle, neuroglobin in nervous tissue  <cit>  and cytoglobin in a variety of non-neuronal cells  <cit> . invertebrate globins constitute a more heterogeneous group in terms of structure and function. they range from single-domain globins to large, multisubunit, multidomain hemoglobins and can be fused with nonglobin subunits forming chimeric proteins. besides a conventional o <dig> storage and transport function, a wealth of diverse functions has been described for invertebrate globins  <cit> . nematodes express distinct globin isoforms in the pseudocoel, body wall and cuticle  <cit> . the emergence of whole genome analysis tools has revealed even higher levels of complexity. in silico analysis of the c. elegans genome identified  <dig> putative globin genes in this species using a robust alignment procedure based on conserved structural features of the classical globin fold. these globins feature a wide diversity in gene structure, amino acid sequence and expression profiles. despite this remarkable variety some of them display significant sequence similarity to vertebrate myoglobin, neuroglobin and cytoglobin  <cit> .

the availability of full genomic sequences of two additional caenorhabditis species presents a unique opportunity to explore the evolutionary globin dynamics of these species. in this study we provide a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the caenorhabditis globin gene family and we document that globins are found in a broad range of other nematode species.

RESULTS
occurrence of globins in the nematoda
we identified globin gene sequences and exon-structures from full genomic sequences of five nematodes: the caenorhabditis species c. elegans, c. briggsae and c. remanei  and the distantly related nematodes pristionchus pacificus  and brugia malayi  . this allows comparison of nematode globins across three levels – ortholog evolution within the caenorhabditis genus, ortholog evolution across more distantly related nematodes and evolution of paralogous genes.

ortholog conservation for c. elegans globins varied across levels. we identified clear orthologs of all  <dig> c. elegans genes in c. briggsae and c. remanei, but reciprocal blast searches with the tblastn algorithm  <cit>  and the c. elegans globin amino acid sequences identified only  <dig> and  <dig> globins in the genomes of pristionchus pacificus and brugia malayi, respectively, reducing the number of orthologs shared by all  <dig> species to  <dig> 

by screening nembase  <cit>  we found  <dig> parasitic globins in several other parasitic nematodes with e-values below e- <dig>  some matched sequences of already known nematode globins from genbank, while others lacked parts of the a-or h-helix reducing the total number of different nembase est clusters to  <dig> . thus far, we can conclude that globins are present in  <dig> different nematode species representing  <dig> nematode clades . in addition to the species listed in table  <dig>  partial globin sequences were also detected in heterodera schachtii, litomosoides sigmodontis, meloidogyne chitwoodi and strongyloides ratti.

 accession numbers correspond to those in nembase.

two separate globin classes?
overall, we recovered over  <dig> new globin-like sequences from exhaustive database searches. globin domains were extracted, aligned  and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. bayesian inference of the globin domains of all  <dig> c. elegans globins and globins from a representative set of  <dig> non-rhabditid, mostly parasitic, species and globins from plants, trematodes and a sea anemone  as outgroup taxa clearly separated two classes of nematode globins. class i globins comprises c. elegans zk <dig> , well known globins from other nematode species and novel related nematode globin isoforms as well as the trematode globins and is supported by 100% posterior probability. class ii globin genes consist of the remaining  <dig> caenorhabditis globins and novel orthologs thereof, identified in parasitic nematodes . they form a more diverse clade that is resolved from the sea anemone globins with moderate support . this pattern was essentially retained, though not satisfactorily supported, when more globins from distantly related eukaryotes were included in the analysis . we included the cnidarian and trematode globins in this analysis because a recent phylogenomic analysis resolved the cnidaria as a sister taxon to the bilateria and the lophotrochozoa  as a sister taxon to the ecdysoza, to which the nematoda belong  <cit> . thus bayesian inference seems to indicate that a class ii ancestral globin evolved before the divergence of the platyhelminthes and the nematoda and radiated further in the nematode phylum. alternative phylogenetic methods, neighbor-joining  and maximum likelihood , were consistent with bayesian analysis but statistical support was not significant .

the finding that  <dig> parasite est's resolve with class ii globins feeds our expectation that many more are to be detected as more nematode genome sequences will become available. the phylogenetic trees represented in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig> clearly illustrate that the divergence of the globin genes preceded species divergence. also, molecular and species trees  agree very well for most globin genes. of note are the very short branch lengths from the caenorhabditis ancestor to the three extant species, considering that these species diverged around  <dig> million year ago  <cit>  . these branch lengths are disproportionally short, relative to the branch lengths generated for brugia and pristionchus and even more so to those representing the divergence of the globin genes. a likely explanation is that the rate of evolution of the globin genes drastically slowed down in caenorhabditis. alternatively, diversity within caenorhabditis could represent less of nematode history  than previously appreciated. to distinguish between these possibilities we explored the rate of evolution of several other gene families including astacins, superoxide dismutases, glutathione s-transferases, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, hedgehog-related proteins and atp-binding proteins. we assembled a matrix of as many as possible five-way orthologs for the five taxa and analyzed the resulting matrix by bayesian inference using partitioning of the data . the ratios of the branch lengths from brugia malayi or pristionchus pacificus to the caenorhabditis internal node and the average branch length of that node to the extant species suggest that the evolutionary rate is quite variable among gene families . however, these results also suggest that four  out of the seven multigene families tested evolved more slowly in the caenorhabditis lineage.

tissue-specific expression
we constructed gene fusions of approx  <dig> –  <dig> bp upstream promoter and enhancer regions for all  <dig> globin genes to the coding region of gfp. spatial expression patterns were observed for  <dig> genes. although we have not yet unambiguously identified the specific cells expressing these genes it is clear that these globins are expressed in distinct, mostly non-overlapping sets of cells. most globin genes were expressed in neuronal cells in the head and tail portions of the body, and the nerve cord. a minority of the globin genes were expressed in non-neuronal tissues, including body wall and vulval muscle and the pharynx; only one globin gene, c26c <dig>  was expressed in muscular tissue exclusively. we never observed gfp expression in the intestine or gonad .

intron evolution
analysis of the gene structures for conserved globin domains for the  <dig> five-way conserved orthologs revealed striking differences across evolutionary levels . consistent with previous findings , most intron positions  were conserved across caenorhabditis species. orthologous gene structures were more diverged between genera, but majorities of positions were shared across genera for each species . to determine the relative contribution of intron loss and gain to these patterns, we used previously published methods  <cit>  to reconstruct evolution . estimated numbers of gains and losses were similar , in stark contrast to patterns observed within caenorhabditis  <cit> . these reconstructions suggest very different histories in caenorhabditis  and p. pacificus .

the most striking pattern is seen at the level of divergence between paralogs. in contrast to the generally conserved intron positions of most eukaryotic globins, nematode globins exhibit a tremendous variability in intron positions . interestingly, only one caenorhabditis globin  displays the typical ancestral intron positions common to vertebrates and other eukaryotes , as do the b. malayi and p. pacificus orthologs. in addition, the brugia ortholog of c. elegans globin gene zk <dig> , which has only one intron inserted at e <dig> , has b <dig>  and g <dig> , whereas the pristionchus ortholog contains b <dig>  and g <dig>  as well as e <dig> . finally, we found no strong evidence for or against any particular model of intron gain – consistent with the apparent age of the introns , no clear sequence similarity was observed to other genomic sequences  or to flanking exonic sequences . the diversity of globin intron positions in nematodes stands in stark contrast to that observed in some other lineages. for instance, in vertebrates, despite a degree of sequence divergence among paralogous globins comparable to that in nematodes, intron positions are generally conserved. notably, intron-exon structure of nematode globins follows protein divergence; f21a <dig>  is both the only gene to retain both ancestral introns, and shows the highest sequence identity to vertebrate globins .

in total, then, nematode globin intron-exon structures suggest a large amount of intron change  in deep nematode ancestors, followed by differential loss and gain in individual subsequent lineages, with the caenorhabditis lineage showing a pronounced excess of loss over gain. these data deepen the mystery of atypical nematode intron evolution .

mode of selective pressure
the striking diversity of nematode globins raises the question of the role of natural selection on the evolution of these genes. we determined the ratio of non-synonymous  to synonymous substitution  rates for each orthologous briggsae/elegans pair . the substitution ratio  is expected to be near  <dig> for genes under neutral selection, greater than  <dig> for genes under positive selection and smaller than  <dig> for those under negative selection. all ω-ratios ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> , indicating functional constraint. similar results were found for the orthologous elegans/remanei  and briggsae/remanei  pairs. no substantial differences were obtained when this analysis was applied on the globin domains only . all c. elegans globin genes are expressed  <cit> . although pseudogenes have been found in c. elegans with ω-ratios down to  <dig>  , the combination of these findings refutes the possibility that some of them would be pseudogenes.

we also asked whether the large n- and c-terminal extensions of many c. elegans globins are required for their specific function. to this end we searched for positive selection on individual amino acids, because positive selection is thought to act only on specific residues in a protein that is under purifying selection  <cit> . no positive selection was detected using the maximum likelihood procedure of thomas et al.  <cit> , even in globin y75b7al. <dig>  which is a chimeric polypeptide composed of a c-terminal globin domain and an n-terminal domain that has all characteristics of a g-coupled sensor. this domain contains  <dig> transmembrane helices and this structure is a candidate target for positive selection  <cit> . the strong purifying selection acting on the globin genes is consistent with the slowing of the rate of evolution of the exon-structures in the genus caenorhabditis.

CONCLUSIONS
our study unveils an unexpected complexity of the globin family in nematodes. caenorhabditis species contain a very large number of globin genes, and even distantly related nematode species harbor orthologs to many of them. our analysis provides some evidence for a number of gene duplication events giving rise to a class of globin genes that is likely unique to the nematode phylum. it remains to be seen whether this class will persist as more genomes will become available.

it is generally accepted that gene duplication played a major role in the evolution of eukaryotic genomes, particularly in the origin of multi-gene families  <cit> . duplication events that gave rise to the radiation of nematode globin genes most likely occurred too long ago to leave behind obvious evidence of adaptive evolution. the dispersion of the globin genes over all six chromosomes of c. elegans is consistent with this idea. globins r <dig>  and f49e <dig>  are exceptional in showing strong sequence conservation  and sharing  <dig> intron positions . however, they are located on different chromosomes, arguing against a very recent tandem duplication event. similarly, both c. briggsae orthologs are found on different chromosomes.

why would tiny animals like caenorhabditis species need up to  <dig> different globins? we have shown that they are all expressed and subject to strong purifying selection. extensive gene duplication appears to be typical for caenorhabditis. other surprisingly large gene families include astacins  <cit> , insulins  <cit> , chemoreceptors  <cit>  and orphan nuclear receptors hnf <dig>  <cit> . subfunctionalization is frequently invoked to explain the retention of duplicate genes, and differences in gene expression patterns of duplicate genes are generally advanced in support of this hypothesis  <cit> . it is likely that this mechanism was the driving force for the expansion of the caenorhabditis globin family. we have demonstrated that these genes are expressed in distinct subsets of cells and that they are subject to strong purifying selection, in line with this hypothesis. further support is provided by differential expression of subsets of globin genes in the dauer stage and upon oxygen deprivation  <cit> . evidence is mounting that behavioral responses of c. elegans to attracting or repelling chemicals including oxygen and co <dig> are generated by gene activities that are deployed in different combinations of neurons  <cit> . individual worm neurons seem to have attained very high specialization which is in keeping with their expressing unique or small subsets of globin isoforms.

to date the precise function of none of these globins is known. it seems unlikely that they would all be required for simple oxygen transportation or storage purposes. globins that are upregulated when oxygen supply is low might serve this function  <cit> . other functions are also plausible. it has been shown that c. elegans senses molecular oxygen through the heme domain of a guanylate cyclase homolog  and reacts rapidly to changing oxygen levels with aerotaxis responses  <cit> . we expect that some globins may play similar roles in distinct sensory neurons. one likely candidate is globin y75b7al. <dig> which has all characteristics of a g-coupled sensor. still other functions are worth consideration. globin t22c <dig>  oxidizes instantly to the ferric form in the presence of oxygen and is therefore not capable of reversible oxygen binding . we speculate that this globin may participate in redox reactions with an as yet unidentified reaction partner. alternatively, peroxidase activity which is a latent but inherent property of globins might have evolved to become the ultimate function of other c. elegans globins. finally, we cannot exclude a potential role as an alternative oxidase during anaerobiosis, when levels of oxygen drop below saturation of cytochrome oxidase, as has been well documented for plant cells  <cit> . future research shall provide more answers.
