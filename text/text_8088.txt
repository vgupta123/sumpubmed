BACKGROUND
cellular processes constitute complex systems and cannot be described using a simplistic view. to fully understand the functioning of cellular processes, it is not enough to simply assign functions to individual genes, proteins and other cellular macro-molecules. biological networks depicting interactions among components present an integrated look at the dynamic behaviour of the cellular system. biological networks may be categorized  <cit>  as metabolic pathways, signal transduction pathways, gene regulatory networks and protein-protein interaction  networks  <cit> . the advent of micro-array technology enabled the system biologist to study the dynamic behaviour of genes in multiple conditions. due to the availability of large collections of gene expression data, it is now possible to reconstruct or reverse-engineer the cellular system in-silico.

a gene co-expression network  is a collection of genes in a cell which interact with each other and with other molecules in the cell such as proteins or metabolites, thereby governing the rates at which genes in the network are transcribed into mrna. a cen is normally represented as an undirected graph, where a node represents a gene or gene product and an undirected edge represents a significant co-expression relationship  <cit>  between the genes considering a series of gene expression measurements. on the other hand, a gene regulatory network  is a directed graph, where a node represents a gene and a directed edge represents a biochemical process such as a reaction, transformation, interaction, activation or inhibition. compared to a grn, a cen does not attempt to draw direct causal relationships among the participating genes in the form of directed edges. a module extracted from a co-expression network  <cit>  may contain co-regulated gene clusters which interact among themselves and take part in a common biological process.

a number of techniques have been proposed for genetic network construction  <cit> . many approaches use statistical, machine learning or soft-computing techniques  <cit>  as discovery tools.

network models such as bayesian  <cit>  and boolean networks  <cit>  are used to infer interrelationships among genes. kwon et al.  <cit>  extract gene regulatory relationships for cell cycle-regulated genes with activation or inhibition between gene pairs. regulatory relationships have also been deduced from correlation of co-expressions, between dna-binding transcription regulators and target genes, by using a probabilistic expression model  <cit> .

mitra et al.  <cit>  propose a bi-clustering technique to extract simple gene interaction networks. they use continuous column multi-objective evolutionary bi-clustering to extract rank correlated gene pairs. such pairs are used to construct the gene network for generating relationship between a transcription factor and its target's expression level. jung and cho  <cit>  propose an evolutionary approach for construction of gene  networks from gene expression time-series data. it assumes an artificial gene network and compares it with the reconstructed network from the gene expression time-series data generated by the artificial network. next, it employs real gene expression time-series data to construct a gene network by applying the proposed approach.

mutual information  <cit>  or correlation  <cit>  based approaches have been proposed for extracting genetic networks. it has been observed that two genes with high mutual information are non-randomly associated with each other with biological significance. butte et al.  <cit>  compute comprehensive pair-wise mutual information for all genes in an expression dataset. by picking a threshold for mutual information  and using only associations at or above the threshold, they construct what are called relevance networks . followed by rn a number of promising techniques have been proposed so far. some of the well known algorithms are clr  <cit> , aracne  <cit>  and mrnet  <cit> . the clr algorithm modifies the mi score based on the empirical distribution of all mi scores. the aracne algorithm filters out indirect interactions from triplets of genes with the data processing inequality. mrnet uses an iterative feature selection method based on a maximum relevance/minimum redundancy criterion.

from biological point of view, expression patterns convey significant meaning. two genes happen to be biologically associated, if their expression profiles show pattern similarity. as a result, existing gene expression analysis techniques give importance directly or indirectly to the pattern based similarity. below we present a brief discussion on various expression patterns generally observed in the gene expression data.

patterns in expression profiles
profile plots of gene expression data revels a number of interesting patterns in the expression. from biological point of view, patterns play an important role in discovering functions of genes, disease targets or gene interactions. scaling and shifting  <cit>  are the patterns that commonly discussed in majority of the literatures. in shifting patterns  <cit>  the gene profiles show similar trends, but distance-wise, they may be away from each other .

in terms of expression values, gene patterns follow an additive distance between them. formally, shifting pattern can be defined as follows.

given two gene expression profile gi = {ei <dig>  ei <dig>  · · ·, eik} and gj = {ej <dig>  ej <dig>  · · · , ejm} with m expression values, a profile is called as shifted pattern, if expression value eik can be related with ejk with constant additive factor αk under kth condition. this can be written as follows.

  eik=ejk+αk,fork=1 to m 

similarly, scaling patterns in gene expression follow roughly a multiplicative distance between the patterns. a profile is called as scaling pattern, if expression value eik can be related with ejk with constant multiplicative factor βk under kth condition. scaling pattern can be defined as:

  eik=ejk×βk, for k=1 to m 

as shown in figure  <dig>  values of g <dig> are roughly three times larger than those of g <dig>  and values of g <dig> are roughly three times larger than those of g <dig>  in nature, it may happen that due to different environmental stimuli or conditions, the pattern g <dig> responds to these conditions similarly, although g <dig> is more responsive or more sensitive to the stimuli than the other two.

most often the patterns in figure  <dig> are termed as co-expressed genes having similar expression patterns. co-expressed patterns signify positive regulation relationship between the genes. in such patterns increase or decrease in expression level of gene gi leads to increase or decrease in expression level of gene gj respectively under the same conditions or time points.

we further note that two genes may be related to each other even when their expression patterns show negative or inverted behaviour  <cit> . in figure  <dig>  expression patterns of rat genes mrps <dig> and pfn <dig>  taken from the ncbi dataset, gds <dig>  clearly show negative behaviour. gene ontology suggests that both are responsible for regulation of interferon-beta production. again, we easily observe that in the yeast datsets given in  <cit> , genes ybl002w and ybl003c have a similar pattern and gene ybl006w has an inverted behaviour with respect to the other two genes. if we observe figure  <dig> more closely, we see that expression patterns also share mixed regulation . as suggested by gene ontology all three genes are involved in nucleosome organization, protein-dna complex sub-unit organization, chromatin and chromosome organization and cellular macro-molecular subunit organization. a group of genes may share a combination of both positive and negative co-regulation under a few conditions or at a few time points. a majority of existing approaches capture genes with similar tendencies as co-expression but ignores patterns like the ones we discuss above. in computing similarity, many well-known techniques do not consider positive- or negative-regulation patterns as presenting co-expression or co-regulation with associated biological significance.

while computing association between a pair genes in a network, most existing techniques extract network using global similarity measures such as correlation or mutual information. correlation measures ineffective in handling scaling and shifting patterns, where shape of two expression patterns are similar although values are not equal. such patterns may affect the correlation measure in drawing out true associations among genes. mutual information  based techniques are effective alternatives to correlation measures. mi works well with co-expressed or positively regulated patterns. however, it fails in handling gene profile with negative and mixed patterns. moreover, mi discretizes the expression values before computation that may lead to information loss. thus, pairwise correlation or mutual information may not able to reveal proper relationships. further, it has been observed that two expression profiles may match each other under some conditions or samples. existing approaches generally compute similarity considering expression values in all dimensions. as a result, correlation score sometimes penalized due to mismatch in the expression values of two genes under some conditions. to handle such situations bi-clustering techniques  <cit>  are found suitable in drawing relationship between a pair  <cit>  of genes in a network. bi-clustering attempts to find subset of genes under subset of conditions. on the other hand in a network, associations are explored between a pair of genes not within a group of genes. as a result, bi-clustering may not be an effective way to be applied while constructing co-expression network. moreover, bi-clustering based techniques are normally computationally expensive in nature.

in our work, we demonstrate that a simple pattern matching based technique can give promising outcomes. we capture pair-wise similarity purely by pattern matching that can handle all types of patterns as discussed above. we consider both positive- and negative-regulation as co-regulation. unlike available measures, we use a support based approach to compute similarity between two expression patterns and include the case where two genes are similar only under some conditions. available techniques for finding co-expression networks mostly discover only limited associations among the genes without any regulation information. since creating a co-expression network is a preliminary step towards gene regulatory network discovery, we use signed edges between the genes to represent positive- and negative-regulations, an important component in gene regulatory networks. majority of the techniques ignore an important aspect i.e. computational costs. computing correlation or mutual information for all possible pairs is a costly affair. over the decade, only a few approaches have been developed to discover gene co-expression networks most of which are expensive in nature. we give due emphasis on development of a computationally effective network reconstruction technique. we compute the similarity between pair of genes using a fast one-pass support count based approach. strong support between a pair of genes represent strong association between them. gene pairs showing high support, i.e., high pattern similarity are used to construct a gene co-expression network. we apply our approach to several synthetic and real expression datasets. we assess our results from real datasets by evaluating the network modules extracted from the network against biologically significant gene ontology  terms associated with a group.

RESULTS
this section provides details of experiments conducted, the datasets used and validation of the results. we apply gecon to real and synthetic gene expression data consisting of publicly available seven benchmark gene expression datasets and thirteen in silico datasets from the dream  challenges.

input parameters
during our experiments, we observe that higher number of edge  matches between a pair of gene expressions give more significant outcomes. thus, in most experiments, we try to keep the value of θ above 50% of the total number of edges present in the dataset. in order to calculate similarity between two expression profiles in terms of degree of fluctuation, we achieve good results with τ ranging between  <dig> to  <dig> 

in silico dataset
we use the dream challenge data, available in  <cit> , for in silico regulatory network construction. dream <dig> and dream <dig> are the two challenges for which data are available. dream <dig> involves fifteen benchmark datasets, five each of various sizes . the structures of the benchmark networks are obtained by extracting modules from real biological networks. at each size, two of the networks are extracted from the regulatory networks of e. coli and yeast. dream <dig> dataset is very similar to the dream <dig> dataset, containing a total of  <dig> networks, five each of size  <dig> and  <dig>  the in silico datasets generated based on  <cit>  for our experiments are characterized in table  <dig> 

brief description about dream challenge synthetic datasets generated using marbach platform. network size indicates the number of genes participated in the network.

we compare our predictions with three well-known gene regulatory network reconstruction algorithms, aracne  <cit> , clr  <cit>  and mrnet  <cit> . r implementation of the three algorithms is available in  <cit> . for the three algorithms, we use the parameters as used in  <cit> . prediction effectiveness is compared against the in slico networks given in marbach platform  <cit>  using three different metrics for evaluating accuracy: aupvr , auroc  and fβ score. roc curves are commonly used to evaluate prediction results. however, roc curves may not be the appropriate measure when a dataset contains large skews in the class distribution, which is commonly the case in transcriptional network inference. as an alternative, precision vs. recall  curves are used for measuring prediction accuracy  <cit> . the pvr curve may be more sensitive when there is a much larger negative set than the positive set. computing the area under the curve  of a roc or pvr curve is a way to reduce roc or pvr performance to a single value representing expected performance. a compact representation of the pvr diagram is the maximum and/or the average f score  <cit> , which is the harmonic average of precision and recall. the general formula for f score with respect to a non-negative β value is:

  fβ=precision.recall+recall. 

two commonly used f measures are the f <dig> measure, which weights recall higher than precision, and the f <dig>  measure, which puts more emphasis on precision than recall. the f-score estimates the effectiveness of retrieval assuming recall is β times more important than precision. in our experiments we preferred f <dig>  score. the effectiveness of prediction by gecon on all the datasets compared to other algorithms are shown in figure  <dig>  an average percentage improvement of gecon over other algorithms along with performance scores are also presented in table  <dig>  in terms of aupr, gecon achieves more than  <dig> times better performance than other algorithms. similarly for other scores we can easily observe performance improvement of gecon compare to other algorithms.

the performance scores of four algorithms and the performance improvement of gecon compare to other algorithms in terms of three measures namely, aupr, auroc and f-score.

from the figures it is evident that gecon outperforms all other algorithms in terms of network prediction on all three scores. in case of dataset d <dig>  gecon achieves a very high au score of . <dig> and auroc of . <dig> and fβ score of . <dig>  other algorithms exhibit consistent and almost similar trends in all experiments. to justify our claim of one-pass nature of gecon, which is fast in general, we perform execution time comparison of gecon with aracne. due to unavailability of executable codes of all other target algorithms on a java platform, we used only the java version of the original aracne code  for comparison with gecon.

we generate different in-silico expression datasets using the marbach platform  <cit>  by varying the number of genes, keeping the number of time points at  <dig>  the results given in figure  <dig> clearly show that gecon is much faster than aracne.

real datasets
we analyze the results from various real datasets for biological significance in terms of the go annotation database. the details of the datasets are presented in table  <dig> 

characteristics of different real expression datasets used for the experiments along with their sources.

as discussed, we use the concept of support to draw links or inter-relationships among genes. we hypothesise that two gene expression profiles having more support , i.e. their expression profiles matches more number or cases, more they are biologically related. a gene pair satisfying the support criterion with respect to a user defined threshold θ is considered connected. we display only those genes that are linked to others with support higher than the threshold. we use the in silico regulatory network construction platform provided by marbach et. al.  <cit>  for visualizing the networks. in the network, nodes represent genes and lines between nodes represent hypothesized associations among genes. a blue colored arrowhead edge shows positive regulation, whereas a red colored blunt head edge indicates negative regulation between a pair of genes. some networks we generate are presented in figure  <dig>  the genes participating in a co-expression network form a group of coherent or co-expressed genes responsible for common biological activities. we consider such a group a module and analyse the biological significance of the modules in terms of gene ontology in the next section. figure  <dig> also shows the profile plots of selected modules and the corresponding heat map. the largest gene expression values are displayed in red , the smallest values in blue , and intermediate values in shades of red  or blue in the heat map. from the map it can easily be observed that captured modules contain a mix of both up- and down-regulated differentially expressed genes. the cluster profile plot shows the gene expression values of the genes within that cluster with respect to the conditions or time points for each co-expressed group. from the profile, it is evident that gecon is able to detect both positively and negatively co-regulated gene groups as well as identify scaling and shifting patterns  <cit>  in the expression.

biological significance
we determine the biological relevance of the modules comprising of all the genes participating in a common co-expression network, in terms of p  <cit>  and q  <cit>  values against statistically significant go terms validated using the go annotation database. for evaluating functional enrichment of a module in terms of p values we use funcassociate  <cit> . the q-value is the minimal false discovery rate  at which a gene appears significant. the go categories and q-values from an fdr corrected hypergeometric test for enrichment are obtained using genemania  <cit> . q-values are estimated using the benjamini hochberg procedure  <cit> . we report p and q-values of selected modules from several datasets. along with q-values, genemania also provides co-expression, physical and genetic interaction scores for the networks. the co-expression percentage indicates the level of similarity in expressions across conditions. on the other hand, the physical interaction percentage shows the level of protein-protein interaction within a module. in table  <dig>  we present results from genemania for selected modules.

statistical significance of selected network modules from real datasets are shown with respect to q-value based on go database.

module  <dig> obtained from the yeast sporulation network is mainly responsible for cytosolic ribosome formation with q-value  <dig> e- <dig> and module  <dig> exhibits  <dig> % of co-expression where the module is responsible for sporulation in yeast. on the other hand, module  <dig> is responsible for dna replication and preinitiation complex formation and shows very high protein-protein interaction of  <dig> %. kayee's yeast dataset shows a very high q-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  however, the same module shows very poor physical interaction. we also observe 100% co-expression from gds <dig> where module  <dig> , module  <dig>  and module  <dig>  are responsible for oxidoreductase activities, aging regulation and lipid catabolic process. the modules extracted from mouse  are responsible for vacuolar proton-transporting v-type atpase complex formation and cell cortex formation. we also observe  <dig> % of co-expression in the thaliana network module.

significant modules are shown based on p-score and go terms.

for kayee's dataset, gecon shows better performance in terms of high enrichment with p-value, e.g., a p-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  similarly, gds <dig>  gds <dig> and sporulation datasets also contain modules with good functional enrichments.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we present an effective gene co-expression network finding algorithm called gecon for discovering biologically related gene pairs that may form a network of co-expressed genes. the gecon algorithm exploits a fast correlogram matrix based technique for capturing the support for each gene pair in order to compute relationships between gene pairs. gene pairs with strong relationship are used to construct the network. when constructing networks, gecon exploits regulation relationships among genes. we report results to show that gecon is effective in predicting in slico networks based on the dream challenge data. we provide results to show that network modules extracted have high biological significance. moreover, we further establish that the simple expression pattern matching is helpful in finding biologically relevant genes. gene co-expression networks can be used further to predict more complex biological networks. work is underway to discover gene regulatory networks with causality information.
