BACKGROUND
only recently it has been shown that animal and plant genomes produce numerous small, noncoding rnas that act as a guide for the argonaute effector protein regulating gene expression and affecting processes of metabolism, development, epigenetic inheritance, and others  <cit> . three classes of small rnas  have been described, micrornas , small interfering rnas , and piwi-interacting rnas   <cit> . mirnas are the most common and best understood class of non-coding rnas, but with ongoing research in the field of rnai, differences and similarities in biogenesis and functionality of the different smrna classes are becoming clearer  <cit> . mirnas are ~ <dig> nt small non-coding rnas implicated in the regulation of gene expression in development and cell differentiation, the immune system, and homeostasis  <cit> . homologous binding of a mirna to its target genes leads to mrna degradation and translational inhibition but also induces dna methylation  <cit> .

mirnas are assumed to occur at a frequency of approximately 1% - 2% of the total number of genes in the genome of an organism  <cit> . furthermore, it is estimated that about 20% to 30% of human genes are targeted by mirnas as indicated by conserved seed pairing, often flanked by adenosines  <cit> . after the discovery of the first mirnas in caenorhabditis elegans, sequencing surveys have identified mirnas in more than  <dig> organisms including those at the base of the metazoan tree  <cit> . only recently, mirnas have been shown to be expressed in unicellular eukaryotes and algae, e.g. chlamydomonas reinhardtii and ectocarpus siliculosus. accordingly, it has been suggested that mirnas have a long evolutionary history among eukaryotes  <cit> . however, a recent study by tarver et al.  <cit>  that proposed a number of criteria to unambiguously identify mirnas  showed that the majority of identified mirna types from unicellular protists might be explained by alternative means. the authors consequently stated that while the rnai core molecular pathway and genes are conserved among eukaryotes , the products they produce are not, and hence rnai might be an example of molecular exaptation  <cit> .

dinoflagellates are typically unicellular, photosynthetic, free-swimming, biflagellate organisms. they are important primary producers and constitute an important component of freshwater and marine phytoplanktonic communities. there are currently ~ <dig>  living species of dinoflagellates known, which are classified in ~ <dig> genera. dinoflagellates form one of the three main phyla of the alveolates   <cit> . about half of all dinoflagellates are autotrophic , some are heterotrophic, saprophytic, symbiotic, or even parasitic. the autotrophic dinoflagellates are either free-living, or associated with a broad range of hosts as endosymbionts. dinoflagellates possess unique molecular traits that differ from ‘classical’ model organisms. for instance, dinoflagellates have permanently condensed chromosomes  <cit>  and dna that contains some 5-hydroxymethyluracil in place of thymine  <cit> . furthermore, dinoflagellates seem to harbor unusual genes and gene arrangements, such as unidirectional orientation of genes in the genome  <cit> , bacterial type ii rubisco  <cit> , and minicircular plastid dna  <cit> . recent transcriptome studies in dinoflagellates show that dinoflagellates have a paucity of common transcription factors, and seem to only regulate few genes at the level of transcription  <cit> .

one of the most successful mutualistic associations of dinoflagellates is found with scleractinian corals, which contain members of the genus symbiodinium as endosymbiotic algae. this endosymbiotic relationship provides the foundation of coral reef ecosystems by providing the energy to construct the three-dimensional framework of coral reefs  <cit> . together with a specific assemblage of bacteria  the coral host and dinoflagellate symbiont constitute the so-called coral holobiont  <cit> . while coral reefs form biodiversity hotspots in the oceans, their presence is declining because of local  and global  impacts  <cit> . in order to characterize the molecular mechanisms driving these processes, understanding the contribution of each of the holobiont members to coral functioning is crucial. so far, researchers have conducted gene expression analyses mainly in the coral host  <cit>  and looked at changes in the microbial community  <cit> , while large scale gene expression studies in symbiodinium are lacking. given the apparent paucity of regulation of gene expression in symbiodinium and dinoflagellates, a study investigating the integrated expression of smrnas and mrnas presents a compelling possibility to determine the presence of rnai-related regulatory mechanisms that act post-transcriptionally, and provide an alternative means of regulating gene expression.

in this study, we conducted a comprehensive smrna and mrna expression-profiling screen in the dinoflagellate symbiodinium microadriaticum , which is a photosynthetic symbiont of scleractinian corals. we sequenced and analyzed  <dig> different experimental treatments of a cultured strain via illumina single and paired-end sequencing. we were interested in 1) understanding presence, diversity, and expression of smrnas and mrnas, 2) identifying proteins of the rnai machinery, and 3) integrating smrna and mrna expression in order to identify functional links between genes and potential smrna regulators.

RESULTS
smrna diversity in symbiodinium microadriaticum
a total of  <dig> million small rna reads were sequenced over  <dig> experimental treatments . after quality filtering and adapter trimming,  <dig> million high-quality reads were retained. subsequent filtering of assembled small rna contigs matching either the symbiodinium transcriptome or known non-coding rnas such as rrnas, trnas, and snornas removed an additional  <dig> , <dig>  reads. the remaining  <dig> million small rna reads collapsed to  <dig> , <dig> distinct genome-matching small rna sequences in a size range from  <dig> –  <dig> nt with the highest read counts falling into the  <dig> nt size fraction, followed by the  <dig> nt fraction . both size fractions were strongly biased towards a 5′-uridine identity . more than two-thirds of the small rnas could be mapped either antisense  or sense  to exons, only a small portion were found to be repeat-associated , or in sense  or antisense  direction to introns.  <dig> % of smrna reads were mapped to other genomic locations.

deg = differentially expressed gene.

mirdeep <dig>  <cit>  predicted  <dig> non-redundant and so far unknown mirnas. from this set, we identified  <dig> novel mirnas  that fulfilled all criteria for mirna identification from higher eukaryotes . another  <dig> mirna candidates fulfilled these criteria but additionally featured perfect base pair complementarity of the passenger/guide duplex . this feature is known from endogenous small-interfering rnas  that are specifically cleaved from dsrna  <cit> . this set of  <dig> bona fide smrnas was not significantly differentially expressed in pairwise comparisons of treatments to the selected reference condition noon .

read counts for guide and passenger strands were derived by pooling counts over conditions. the number of experimental treatments that identified the passenger strand is indicated in brackets. mfe = minimum free energy of precursor.

the majority of guide smrnas were predicted in  <dig> conditions  and another  <dig> smrnas were predicted in  <dig>  and  <dig>  conditions, respectively. for most guide smrna sequences , the respective passenger smrna sequence was found in at least  <dig> conditions, and only for  <dig> smrnas the corresponding passenger smrnas were only found in  <dig> and  <dig> libraries . the lengths of the  <dig> smrnas varied between  <dig> nt an  <dig> nt, but the majority had a length of  <dig> nt  with a bias towards uridine as the 5′ nucleotide  . this provides support to the presence of mirna functionality in symbiodinium as mi et al.  <cit>  have shown that loading of small rnas in argonaute proteins in arabidopsis is directed and critically dependent on a 5′ terminal uridine. the lengths of the corresponding smrna precursors  varied from  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt, and guide strands were found to be processed from the 5′ and 3′ end of the fold-back.  <dig> of the  <dig> smrna precursors could be mapped to either intronic regions  or to unannotated transcripts , both regions have been described to encode precursor mirnas  <cit> . minimum predicted free energies ranged from − <dig>  kcalmol- <dig> to − <dig>  kcalmol- <dig> with an average of − <dig>  kcalmol- <dig> for the fold back . this is in line with values of validated pre-mirnas from other studies. for instance, estimated values for wheat averaged at − <dig>  kcalmol- <dig> <cit> . it is important to note that sufficiently low fold back energies for mirna annotations can also be attained by complementary pairing outside of the duplex region, while the mirna guide-passenger duplex itself features mismatch base pairing. accordingly, the number of matching base pairs between the mature and star sequences, and not the energies themselves, are the critical aspect.

smrna target genes in symbiodinium microadriaticum
smrna-dependent post-transcriptional regulation works through binding of smrnas to specific complementary target sites within transcripts, which ultimately results in gene silencing. the composition of target sites is different for animals and plants. smrna target sites in animals are characterized by short complementary regions in the utr of a gene giving rise to mismatches and bulges, but a general feature is watson-crick base pairing of mirna nucleotides 2– <dig> in three canonical manners   <cit> . in contrast, plant mirnas bind over their entire length  to the coding sequence and/or the utr of a gene . given that symbiodinium diverged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  million years ago from the last common ancestor of eukaryotes  <cit> , and therefore shares a similar evolutionary distance to plant and animals  <cit> , we searched for both animal- and plant-like target genes.

in total, we found  <dig>  animal-like target sites in the 3′ utrs of  <dig>  genes from the set of  <dig>  genomic genes . most target sites matched 7mer-m <dig> seeds . the remaining  <dig> target sites were flanked by a 3′ adenosine in the mrna . previous studies showed that the 3′ adenosine anchor of mirna targets is highly overrepresented for mirnas of any 5′ identity, and accordingly, presents a feature that increases confidence in mirna target predictions  <cit> . most stable mirna-mrna duplexes were formed by 8mer  and 7mer-m <dig> target sites , followed by 7mer-a <dig> sites . taking into account the energy needed to open mrna secondary structures , overall energy requirements  averaged at − <dig>  kcalmol- <dig> and only differed slightly with respect to target seeds .  <dig> predicted target genes provided at least two copies of landing sites for a specific mirna .

we searched for plant-like target sites by looking for near-perfect base pairing between smrnas and mrnas in the set of  <dig>  genomic genes   <cit> .  <dig> of the  <dig> smrnas targeted a total of  <dig> genes with four or fewer mismatches over the entire lengths of the smrnas.  <dig> of these showed complementarity to the predicted coding sequence , whereas for  <dig> genes smrna binding sites were identified in the 3′ utr. in order to control the rate of false positives, we conducted  <dig>  identical searches with cohorts of  <dig> randomized small rnas against the set of  <dig>  genomic genes. this analysis showed that by decreasing the number of mismatches from  <dig> to  <dig>  the ratio of false positives dropped from around 1: <dig>  to 1: <dig>  . adjusting smrna-mrna complementarity to a maximum of  <dig> mismatches resulted in  <dig> plant-like targets with high confidence. of these targets,  <dig> showed complementarity within the predicted cds and  <dig> were found in the respective 3′ utrs .

next we analyzed the set of predicted and go-annotated animal- and plant-like target genes for go category overrepresentation via goeast  <cit>  in order to identify molecular processes in which smrnas are potentially involved. go annotations for  <dig> animal-like mirna target genes were tested for go term enrichment against a background set of  <dig>  go-annotated genes  . similarly, an enrichment analysis was conducted for  <dig> go-annotated plant-like mirna target genes that were searched against a background set of  <dig>  go-annotated genomic genes . both analyses showed an enrichment of processes related to protein modification and metabolism . additionally, we found processes related to signaling, nucleic acid, small molecule binding, cytoskeleton, and oxidoreductase to be enriched in the set of predicted animal-like target genes.

symbiodinium microadriaticum transcriptome and expression
a total of  <dig> million rna read pairs were sequenced over all  <dig> libraries and assembled into  <dig>  genes ≥ 250 bp with an average transcript length of  <dig>  bp . about 43% of the genes could be annotated via blastx to any of the swiss-prot, trembl  <cit> , or genbank nr  <cit>  databases with an e-value < 1e- <dig> . between  <dig> and  <dig> million rna read pairs were sequenced for each experimental treatment , and around 65% of those could be mapped to the transcriptome for expression estimates . interestingly, we found between 94% and 98% of all genes expressed in any condition  > 0). taking into consideration only the genes with an fpkm >  <dig>  we still found between 64% and 69% of the transcriptome to be expressed under any condition. the  <dig> conditions were equally well annotated and we did not find deviations in the distribution of gene annotations for the different treatments . we found an underrepresentation of known transcription factor binding domains . the ccch-type zinc finger domain  and the cold-shock domain  were the most prevalent. genes bearing transcription factor domains were expressed between  <dig>  and  <dig>  fpkm , indicating a highly variant expression.

for elucidation of differentially expressed genes, the experimental condition noon was selected as a reference to which the other treatments were compared . the  <dig> experimental treatments were: 1) noon: 12 h/12 h day/night cycle, sampled at noon; 2) 4°c: 4°c for 4 hours; 3) 16°c: 16°c for 4 hours; 4) 34°c: 34°c for 12 hours; 5) 36°c: 36°c for 4 hours; 6) 20 g: 20 g/l nacl salt content for 4 hours; 7) 60 g: 60 g/l nacl salt content for 4 hours; 8) ds : 18 hour dark period; 9) dc : 12 h/12 h day/night cycle, sampled at midnight). in contrast to the large number of assembled genes in the transcriptome , we found a very low number of significantly differentially expressed genes , namely between  <dig>  and  <dig> genes , except for heat stress-related treatments. incubation of cultures at 34°c for 12 hours resulted in differential expression of  <dig> genes, whereas exposure to 36°c for 4 hours resulted in  <dig>  differentially expressed genes. in the 36°c treatment the number of downregulated genes  exceeded the number of upregulated genes  more than 7-fold. on average, we found a higher number of genes to be downregulated than upregulated . this might be attributed to our choice of reference. the noon experimental treatment showed the highest number of expressed genes considering a fpkm >  <dig>  average fold-changes of differentially expressed genes were around 8-fold , and minimum and maximum fold-changes exceeded −1000-fold  and +250-fold , respectively .

differential expression of photosynthetic genes among experimental treatments
we looked for enrichment of go categories in the set of significantly differentially expressed genes of a given treatment . we found the highest number of significantly enriched categories  in the 36°c treatment  and the lowest number in the 16°c , corresponding to the highest and lowest number of differentially expressed genes over treatments. only less than half of all genes could be go-annotated .

in the 4°c treatment we found photosynthesis-related terms to be enriched . additionally, and similarly to the 16°c condition, we found carbon utilization as an affected process. this might be explained by the depletion of primary carbon sources due to decrease in photosynthetic productivity as indicated, e.g. by a ~20-fold downregulation of the gene carbonic anhydrase .

for both, the 34°c and 36°c treatment, we found motility- and membrane-related processes to be affected. however, while we saw upregulation of heat shock and oxidative stress related genes in the 34°c condition , the 36°c condition did not show upregulation of stress-related genes but rather was characterized by an overall downregulation of gene expression. this was substantiated in the go process analysis where we saw a diversity of processes to be affected that were not necessarily related to a heat shock response . additionally, a suite of photosynthesis-related processes were identified, though primarily in the 36°c condition.

the analysis of treatments related to ionic stress  both showed a consistent and broad downregulation of photosynthesis-related genes  and processes . overall, we identified a common set of  <dig> genes and  <dig> processes in both of these treatments. however, histone demethylation and histone demethylase activity were among the go terms that were only enriched in the 20 g treatment. this might indicate that alteration of histone methylation states plays a role in ionic stress.

for the dark cycle  and dark stress  treatments we again saw a wide representation of go processes related to photosynthesis. overall, we identified a set of  <dig> out of  <dig>  and  <dig> out of  <dig>  go terms that were significantly enriched in both treatments . additionally, we identified terms related to oxidative stress  but only in the ds treatment.

symbiodinium microadriaticum rnai pathway
while the extent of evolutionary conservation of smrnas in eukaryotes is controversial, all organisms seem to possess a shared and inherited rnai machinery that consists in its core of the proteins dicer  and argonaute   <cit> . we identified  <dig> dicer and  <dig> argonaute homologs in our genome and transcriptome data .

in the dicer homolog, we found the two rnase iii domains that occupy a central role in the cleavage of the guide-passenger duplex from its double-stranded precursor  <cit> . more specifically, we identified the key acidic residues that coordinate a divalent mg2+ ion, which is essential for the activity of the ribonuclease, to be conserved in our homolog  <cit> . additionally, we identified the conserved dsrbd domain, whereas a paz domain was not found. in contrast, the  <dig> symbiodinium argonaute homologs all displayed a paz domain as well as a piwi domain. the paz domain binds to dsrna ends, preferentially with short 3′ nt overhangs  <cit> , and is shared between proteins of the argonaute and dicer family. consequently the absence of a paz domain in dicer might be related to the draft nature of the genome used. overall, all argonaute homologues displayed strong evolutionary conservation to model organisms as well as to each other. last, we were interested in elucidating whether homologs of the small rna 2′-o-methyltransferase  existed. this protein is needed for final maturation of a subset of small rnas  by 2′-o-methylation on the 3′ terminal nucleotide  <cit> . we found  <dig> homolog of the small rna 2′-o-methyltransferase  showing a high degree of conservation in the crucial methyltransferase domain .

despite the absence of the paz rna binding domain in dicer, conservation of the key protein domains in homologs of dicer, argonaute, and hen <dig> suggest the presence of a functional rnai machinery in symbiodinium, and confirms the deep phylogenetic history of the mirna protein machinery.

integrating smrna and mrna expression profiling
previous studies have shown that integrating smrna with mrna expression data is able to uncover smrna-mrna gene regulatory network relationships  <cit> . here, we correlated smrna and mrna expression estimates over all  <dig> treatments to identify processes that are under potential smrna control. to do this, expression of our  <dig> identified smrnas was correlated to  <dig>  go-annotated genes of the symbiodinium transcriptome assembly, resulting in  <dig>  comparisons. in total,  <dig>  smrna-mrna comparisons had a correlation coefficient of rho > + <dig>  or < − <dig> , representing  <dig>  distinct genes . the total number of negatively and positively correlated genes was similar, but we found a slightly higher number of negatively correlated genes .

interestingly, the number of distinct  genes was very similar to the total number of genes that were negatively or positively correlated. this indicates that relatively little overlap existed between correlated genes identified for the different smrnas. the number of correlated genes for a given smrna ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> 

we searched for enriched functions in the set of correlated genes over all smrnas . we identified  <dig> enriched go terms over all smrnas that were negatively correlated to mrna expression . similarly, we identified  <dig> enriched go terms over all smrnas that were positively correlated to mrna expression profiles. manual assortment of enriched go terms to higher order categories revealed an overlap in processes for positively and negatively correlated smrna-mrna pairs . interestingly, we also found go terms associated with immunity  and dna damage .

only categories that are negatively and positively correlated are shown.

discussion
smrna diversity in symbiodinium microadriaticum
it is now well established that mirnas play a central role in gene regulation in plants, animals, and yeast  <cit> . only recently, a number of studies started looking into smrna diversity in unicellular eukaryotes and discovered a rich repertoire of mirnas, which include lineage-specific as well as previously identified mirnas from plants or animals  <cit> . however, re-analysis of these data under a set of stringent criteria formulated by tarver et al.  <cit>  indicated firstly that among analyzed protists only brown and green algae possess mirnas, and secondly that no mirnas have been identified  that are shared between plants, animals, and protists. here, we studied smrna expression in symbiodinium, the photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbiont of scleractinian corals, over  <dig> different treatments in parallel with rnaseq. our aim was three-fold: firstly, to characterize smrna and mrna diversity and expression in symbiodinium, secondly to identify proteins of the rnai machinery, and thirdly to correlate smrna and mrna diversity and expression. our study represents the most comprehensive smrna and mrna data set for a dinoflagellate to date, and we identified a set of  <dig> smrnas as well as  <dig>  genes.

none of the  <dig> identified smrnas were identified in previous mirna screens of unicellular protists, and we did not identify known mirnas from animals or plants. note that this is despite the fact that we were assaying  <dig> different conditions, and accordingly, were able to query a much larger sequencing space than previous protist studies  <cit> . furthermore, we were able to independently verify smrnas over different experimental treatments potentially reducing the number of false positives considerably. in our set of  <dig> smrnas, we identified  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> sirnas indicating that symbiodinium not only produces mirnas, but also sirnas. interestingly, within the set of smrnas we found candidates that had only processed guide and passenger sequences, but not products originating from the hairpin loop . this gives rise to the possibility of a two-step dicer process when cleaving the guide-passenger duplex from the hairpin loop, and warrants further examination.

the lengths of smrna precursors from our set of  <dig> bona fide smrnas were between 80– <dig> nt, which is between the sizes for animal  and plant mirnas   <cit> . we note that due to constraints of the mirdeep <dig> core algorithm, smrna precursors longer than  <dig> nt could not be identified in our approach. furthermore, mirna processing in animals takes place in the nucleus and cytoplasm using the endonucleases drosha and dicer, respectively. in plants, all mirna processing takes place in the nucleus by dicer  <cit> . we did not identify a drosha homolog . however, we found a homolog of hen <dig> that is involved in the biogenesis of small functional rnas, such as sirnas and pirnas in all metazoans  <cit> .

identifying non-conserved mirnas but conserved dicer and argonaute proteins is in line with the hypothesis that the protein machinery to process mirnas has a common evolutionary origin, whereas the set of generated mirnas is lineage-specific  <cit> . the presence of mirnas in single-celled dinoflagellates in itself is surprising, but functional processes that involve mirnas in multicellular organisms  might be of significance in protists too. interestingly, although we were focusing on the identification of mirnas in symbiodinium,  <dig> of the  <dig> smrnas identified by mirdeep <dig> could be categorized as sirnas as indicated by the perfect complementarity of the guide passenger duplex. one explanation for this is that the typical pre-mirna hairpins were not considered initially, so that sirnas with perfect complementary base pairing of the hairpins were identified as well.

smrna target genes in symbiodinium microadriaticum
mirna target identification was conducted by searching for sites that adhered to the general criteria for animal- and plant-like targets, as no functionally validated target sites of closely related species are available  <cit> . for mammalian mirna targets, the rate of false positives is commonly reduced by looking for evolutionary conservation between species as well as the presence of experimentally validated target properties   <cit> . here, we tried to increase stringency by considering target accessibilities  and the multiplicity of target sites, both of which have been shown to be important features beyond the seed pairing  <cit> .

mapping of our set of  <dig> bona fide smrnas to animal- and plant-like targets identified a suite of potential genes that are under smrna regulation, and we identified considerably more animal- than plant-like targets. please note that whereas the criteria for animal-like target identification are somewhat relaxed , we allowed for only  <dig> mismatches between mirna-mrna plant-like pairings after false positive estimation via randomized smrnas. the signal-to-noise ratio of alignments with less than three mismatches was about 1: <dig> suggesting that the identified mirna-mrna pairings were highly specific. subsequent go analysis of predicted target genes identified a common set of processes that were enriched in animal- and plant-like target genes , although a larger number of significant go terms were produced for animal-like target genes.

following our above reasoning that different lineages possess their distinct set of mirnas, the characteristics of corresponding mrna target sites need to be determined experimentally for final proof. further studies incorporating methods that crosslink argonaute proteins together with a bound mirna and the matching mrna, e.g. hits-clip  <cit> , will unequivocally reveal the nature of mirna-mrna target binding in symbiodinium. similarly, knocking down dicer will reveal the nature of mirna biogenesis in symbiodinium <cit> .

symbiodinium microadriaticum transcriptome and expression
our transcriptome assembly produced a set of  <dig>  genes, which is in the range of what has been determined previously  <cit> .  <dig> % of all genes in the transcriptome could be annotated via blastx, which is also close to what has been found previously  <cit> . interestingly, more than 90% of all genes were expressed under any condition. we found a low number of differentially expressed genes between the different treatments on average, but this finding might be limited by the low statistical power of the analysis. however, previous studies also suggest that transcriptional regulation is scarce in dinoflagellates, which would be explained by a paucity of transcription factors  <cit> . further, the two most common transcription factor domains we identified in symbiodinium  may bind rna rather than dna  <cit> . on the other hand, the 36°c heat shock treatment produced a remarkably high number of differentially expressed genes with the majority of genes being downregulated. it remains to be determined whether exposure to this temperature involved a coordinated environmental shock response   <cit> , or whether we rather measured the dysregulation of gene expression and the collapse of the transcriptional machinery resulting in a subsequent downregulation of gene expression across the board.

treatments related to similar physiologies  produced overlapping sets of enriched go terms. for instance, ionic stress-related treatments  produced a common set of  <dig> downregulated genes assorted into  <dig> processes, the majority of which were related to photosynthesis. chloroplasts have been shown to be one of the most susceptible systems to salt and osmotic stresses  <cit> , and studies in cyanobacteria showed that ionic stress in combination with light stress stimulates repair inhibition of photosystem ii  <cit> .

among the differentially expressed genes of all treatments were genes related to photosynthesis. accordingly, photosynthesis-related go terms were enriched in almost all treatments. it has been shown previously that two of the core photosystem genes  are subject to transcriptional regulation under temperature stress in symbiodinium <cit> . further, psba and psaa are both encoded on so-called minicircles. most of the genes from the chloroplast genome in dinoflagellates are not physically linked on one molecule but are located on these small plasmids  <cit> . most interestingly, in our data differentially expressed genes contributing to the photosynthesis-related go enrichment contained exclusively genes that were encoded on minicircles. accordingly, minicircle-encoded genes might adhere to different mechanisms of transcriptional regulation than genomically-encoded loci, and this might be one of the evolutionary driving forces behind minicircles.

integrating smrna and mrna expression profiling
our correlation analysis of smrna and mrna expression identified a large number of genes whose expression was highly correlated to the expression of distinct smrnas. while we almost found an equal number of positively and negatively correlated genes, the notion that only a very small overlap of genes was correlated to the expression of more than one smrna implies that there is some level of specificity. additionally, the number of correlated genes for distinct smrnas was between  <dig> and  <dig> indicating non-random smrna target specificity, and also that ‘small effect size’ and ‘large effect size’ smrnas might exist in symbiodinium. brennecke et al.  <cit>  provided evidence that an average mirna has approximately  <dig> target sites, and our estimates are within this order of magnitude.

our downstream analysis of go term enrichment for target sites revealed a noticeable overlap between enrichment of positively and negatively correlated processes providing independent support to the control of these processes through smrnas. within the go category enrichment analysis a variety of processes were identified  that were identified before in smrna target screens  <cit> . our data indicate that smrnas potentially regulate a large fraction of protein-coding genes in symbiodinium, and that the regulation is smrna-specific as implied by the small overlap of correlated genes between smrnas. last, a multitude of processes are potentially prone to regulation by smrnas as evidenced by the broad variety of go terms identified, but it is interesting to note that the majority of these processes can be assorted to protein modification, immunity, signaling, dna damage, gene expression, translation, and metabolism.

CONCLUSIONS
in the past decade, mirnas have been uncovered as key regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. in this study we generated and analyzed a comprehensive smrna and mrna expression data set over  <dig> experimental treatments in order to gain insights into smrna and mrna diversity and expression in symbiodinium. the paucity of transcription factor domain-bearing proteins, and the fact that the most common domains may be rna rather than dna binding poses the question as to exactly how symbiodinium is regulating transcription. part of the answer to this might come from our analysis of smrnas in symbiodinium. after application of stringent criteria, we identified a set of  <dig> distinct and previously unidentified bona fide mirnas and sirnas alongside the corresponding core protein machinery for smrna processing. these data together with our analyses of smrna gene targets and smrna-mrna expression correlation indicate that rnai is operational in symbiodinium and potentially hundreds of genes and processes could be under smrna control. the properties of identified smrnas and the structure of potential mrna target sites fall between the criteria established for animals and plants, but long sirna precursor hairpins and the lengths of pre-mirnas as well as the existence of highly specific mirna plant-like target sites might argue for plant-like smrnas in symbiodinium. our data corroborate previous analyses that rnai core proteins are conserved and have a common evolutionary ancestor, whereas the smrnas originating from the machinery are lineage-specific. overall, the emerging picture is that dinoflagellates are not only distinct in terms of genome size, content, and transcriptional regulation, but also rival the complexity of multicellular eukaryotes as evidenced by the presence of a rich set of smrnas and the corresponding protein machinery. importantly, the functional significance of rna-dependent control of organismal processes in single-celled eukaryotes, and their degree of evolutionary conservation, have yet to be determined and await further study.
