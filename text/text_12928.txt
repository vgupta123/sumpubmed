BACKGROUND
the generation of mouse mutants harboring targeted inactivation of desired genes using homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells is a powerful tool to analyze their role in complex brain functions such as learning and memory, synaptic plasticity as well as neurogenesis and neuronal cell death  <cit> . however, inactivation of genes in the germline often results in a lethal phenotype that prevents further analysis of the targeted gene in the adult brain.

to bypass early lethality and to analyze functions of a gene particularly in the adult brain the cre/loxp-recombination system, that allows to conditionally ablate a defined gene, was implemented. in the cre/loxp-recombination system the bacteriophage p <dig> cre recombinase is expressed in a cell-type specific manner. in the cre expressing cells the recombinase mediates excision of an essential part of the targeted gene that has been flanked by two loxp recognition sequences in the same orientation  <cit> .

to drive the expression of cre in the brain, in most cases short promotor fragments of genes with desired expression pattern have been cloned in front of a cre cassette in a plasmid  <cit> . since plasmid-derived transgenes show copy number-independent and often mosaic and ectopic expression  <cit>  the use of bac - or yac -derived transgenes is in favor. in contrast to plasmids, bac and yac vectors harbor large genomic regions containing almost all regulatory elements of the gene locus that was chosen to drive cre expression. however, a given gene locus may not only be expressed in the adult brain, but also during pre- and postnatal development  <cit> . to overcome the necessity to find a gene locus that is active only at a desired time-point during development or at the adult stage fusion proteins consisting of cre recombinase and a mutated ligand-binding domain  of a steroid hormone receptor have been developed to achieve ligand-dependent cre activity. the mutated lbd retains the fusion protein in the cytoplasm and upon binding of a synthetic ligand it translocates into the nucleus, where it mediates the excision of the loxp-flanked dna sequence  <cit> . it has been shown in vitro and in vivo that the creert <dig> is the most potent cre fusion protein with low leakiness and highly efficient induction  <cit> . the creert <dig> fusion protein was so far applied in peripheral cell-types/tissues  <cit>  and within the nervous system in oligodendrocytes and schwann cells  <cit> , astrocytes  <cit>  and neural stem cells  <cit> . the verification of creert2-mediated recombination was only performed using cre reporter mice. cre reporter data are very helpful to detect ligand-independent  activity of the cre and robust induction of recombination, but this type of analysis does not allow to assess incomplete induction. to analyze the extent of gene inactivation, expression analysis of the protein encoded by the targeted gene is mandatory.

in order to target neurons in the adult brain that participate in important brain functions like learning, memory and long term potentiation, we have chosen the camkiiα gene regulatory elements to drive creert <dig> expression in the forebrain including limbic structures like hippocampus and amygdala. we introduced the creert <dig> fusion protein in frame at the atg of the camkiiα gene present on a large genomic fragment in a bac vector using homologous recombination in bacteria. the established transgenic mouse lines  displayed copy number-dependent, forebrain-specific expression of the cre recombinase. using this transgene we show efficient forebrain-specific induction of recombination upon tamoxifen treatment with very low background activity in absence of the ligand restricted to the hippocampus. unlike previous studies utilizing creert <dig> mediated recombination in the brain, we demonstrate for the first time by expression analysis of the protein encoded by the targeted gene, the high efficiency of this inducible gene inactivation system.

RESULTS
copy number-dependent expression of the creert2-fusion protein in the adult mouse hippocampus
to achieve inducible recombination of conditional alleles in neurons of the adult brain, we generated a bac-derived transgene expressing the creert <dig> fusion protein under the control of the regulatory elements of the mouse camkiiα gene . the creert <dig> fusion protein consists of the cre recombinase and a mutated ligand binding domain  of the human estrogen receptor   <cit> . the er-lbd contains a nuclear localization signal that is unmasked upon ligand binding. two point mutations in the er-lbd allow binding of the synthetic ligand tamoxifen and prevent activation of the creert <dig> by endogenous estradiol. therefore, the unliganded form of the creert <dig> fusion protein resides in the cytoplasm and upon tamoxifen binding it translocates into the nucleus and mediates site-specific recombination. we selected a bac vector harboring a genomic insert containing the camkiiα gene locus with a  <dig> kb 5'upstream and a  <dig> kb 3'downstream region from the mouse genome project  <cit> . to obtain the camkcreert <dig> transgene we inserted the coding sequence for the creert <dig> fusion protein at the atg of the camkiiα locus  by homologous recombination in bacteria  <cit> . using an equivalent genomic fragment containing the camkiiα gene our group has already generated a constitutive transgene  that expresses the cre recombinase under the control of the regulatory elements of the mouse camkiiα gene  <cit> .

the modified genomic insert was released and separated from the bac backbone and then introduced into the mouse germline by oocyte injection. transgenic founder animals were identified by pcr and dot blot analysis of tail dna. the f <dig> progeny was used to determine the copy number of the transgene by southern blot . three lines harboring either one, two or four copies of the transgene were chosen for further analyses. we investigated the expression and nuclear translocation of the creert <dig> fusion protein upon tamoxifen treatment by immunohistochemistry on hippocampal vibratome sections using an anti-cre antibody. transgenic animals were injected with either tamoxifen or vehicle  <dig> hours before dispatch. in the vehicle-treated animals the creert <dig> protein was located in the cytoplasm , whereas tamoxifen-treated animals displayed nuclear localization of the cre recombinase in the hippocampus . in addition, copy number-dependent expression was observed, the four-copy line showed stronger expression of the creert <dig> fusion protein than the two-copy line which displayed a stronger cre expression in the hippocampus than the one-copy line . nuclear translocation and copy number-dependent creert <dig> expression was also observed in other brain regions, e.g. cortex .

targeted recombination in adult forebrain regions upon tamoxifen induction
to assess the ert2-mediated control of cre activity in absence of the ligand in forebrain neurons and to examine the efficiency of tamoxifen-induced cre-mediated recombination, camkcreert <dig> mice with different transgene copy numbers were crossed with rosa <dig> cre reporter mice   <cit>  to obtain r26r/camkcreert <dig> mice. the cre reporter line harbors a knock-in of a lacz gene preceded by a stop cassette, flanked by two recognition sequences  for the cre recombinase, in the rosa <dig> locus. upon tamoxifen treatment creert <dig> translocates into the nucleus and deletes the stop cassette thereby permitting β-galactosidase expression.

r26r/camkcreert <dig> mice were injected twice per day with either tamoxifen or vehicle for five consecutive days. whole mount samples of the adult brain from the one-, two- or four-copy line were analyzed for β-galactosidase activity. determination of creert <dig> activity in absence of the ligand revealed that ten weeks old vehicle-injected animals of all three transgenic lines showed very little β-galactosidase activity within the hippocampus only. using whole mount staining we could not detect substantial differences between one, two and four copies of the transgene . after tamoxifen treatment in all three lines β-galactosidase activity was most prominent in the cortex and hippocampus. the one-copy line showed less intense staining than the two- and four-copy lines. however, no apparent difference was observed between the two-copy and the four-copy line . in all three lines no β-galactosidase activity was detected in other organs than the brain after tamoxifen induction .

since the use of the minimal number of transgene copies that allow efficient recombination upon tamoxifen induction is desired, we only characterized for the two-copy line the activity in absence of tamoxifen  in more detail. at the cellular level, using cryosections, vehicle-treated r26r/camkcreert <dig> mice of the two-copy line displayed only few granular neurons in the dentate gyrus and even less pyramidal neurons in the ca <dig> region of the hippocampus that underwent recombination of the reporter allele .

in order to compare the spatial activity of the inducible camkcreert <dig> transgene with the constitutive camkcre transgene, β-galactosidase stained brain whole mount samples of adult r26r/camkcre mice were analyzed as well. both, r26r/camkcreert <dig>  and r26r/camkcre mice showed extensive recombination in hippocampus and cortex . however, the constitutive transgene caused additional recombination in olfactory bulbs, striatum and cerebellum . immunohistochemical staining for cre revealed a strong expression of creert <dig> protein in those regions showing recombination in r26r/camkcreert <dig> mice . as shown for the constitutive camkcre line at the adult stage  <cit> , we could detect only very low level of creert <dig> expression in striatum and thalamus and no expression in cerebellum of camkcreert <dig> transgenic mice . using cre reporter mice we did not observe cre-mediated recombination in any of these regions after tamoxifen application .

to quantify and compare recombination evoked by the constitutive camkcre transgene and the camkcreert <dig> transgene, induced with  <dig> mg tamoxifen twice per day for five consecutive days, at the dna level by southern blot, we generated animals heterozygous for the conditional gr allele   <cit>  harboring either the constitutive  or the inducible cre  transgene respectively. the analysis of adult samples of different brain regions revealed that the areas showing recombination using cre reporter mice  display a comparable degree of recombination for both transgenes . in case of the cerebellum we detected, as expected from the cre reporter data, no recombination of the grflox allele for the induced camkcreert <dig> transgene, but distinct recombination for the constitutive camkcre transgene .

ablation of gr protein expression in the adult brain upon tamoxifen treatment using the camkcreert <dig> transgene
to demonstrate at the cellular level that the tamoxifen-induced creert2-mediated recombination of a targeted gene results in complete protein loss within specific populations of neurons, we generated grflox/flox/camkcreert <dig>  mice with two copies of the camkcreert <dig> transgene. eight weeks old grcamkcreert <dig> mice were treated twice per day either with  <dig> mg tamoxifen or vehicle for five consecutive days and were sacrificed ten days after tamoxifen application. in addition, the mice were injected with  <dig> mg tamoxifen  <dig> hours before dispatch to visualize cre expression. immunohistochemistry revealed creert <dig> expression in the cortex, the hippocampus  as well as in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus   and basolateral amygdala, whereas the central amygdala was spared . accordingly, in neurons of these regions with strong creert <dig> expression, tamoxifen-treated animals show loss of gr protein  compared to vehicle-treated mice . analysis of creert <dig> and gr protein expression in other forebrain structures revealed strong creert <dig> expression and the corresponding gr protein loss in the lateral septum and in the medial preoptic area, whereas in the striatum only weak cre expression and no visible loss of gr protein were detectable . even though cre reporter data revealed creert <dig> activity in absence of the ligand in the hippocampus, the background activity is much too low to allow the detection of a visible loss of gr protein expression in vehicle-treated grcamkcreert <dig> mice in comparison to wild-type animals .

to identify neuronal subtypes that are targeted in the cortex by the camkcreert <dig> transgene, we performed immunohistochemical double-stainings for creert <dig> and markers for the two major neuronal subtypes present in the cortex. gabaergic interneurons were identified by gad65/ <dig> expression and glutamatergic neurons by vglut <dig> expression. we detected no creert <dig> protein expression in gabaergic interneurons, whereas expression of creert <dig> was present in glutamatergic neurons .

effect of variations in transgene copy number and the applied tamoxifen dose on gr protein loss
it has been shown previously that efficient induction of recombination is dependent on the applied tamoxifen dose and the level of creert2expression as well as on the particular conditional allele  <cit> . thus it is possible, that different conditional alleles require different levels of creert <dig> activity. the level of creert <dig> activity is dependent on the expression level of the creert <dig> protein and on the availability of tamoxifen. since the camkcreert <dig> transgene shows copy number-dependent creert <dig> expression, we determined if we can detect an interrelation of transgene copy number and tamoxifen dose for the recombination evoked by this transgene. for this purpose, we injected grcamkcreert <dig> mice harboring one, two or four copies of the transgene with  <dig> mg tamoxifen for five consecutive days once per day  or twice per day  and analyzed the loss of gr protein in hippocampus, cortex and pvn.

the immunohistochemical analysis of the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal ca <dig> region revealed that tamoxifen-treated controls  show no difference in gr protein expression compared to wild-type mice . grcamkcreert <dig> mice with one copy of the transgene  show moderate loss of gr signal after applying  <dig> mg tamoxifen, but a strong decrease of gr protein if  <dig> mg tamoxifen were injected . mutant mice with two camkcreert <dig> copies treated with  <dig> mg tamoxifen also show a strong but incomplete loss of gr protein , comparable to one-copy animals treated with  <dig> mg tamoxifen . grcamkcreert <dig> animals with two and four copies of the transgene display a complete loss of gr after injection of  <dig> mg tamoxifen . likewise, grcamkcreert <dig> mice with four copies of the transgene treated with  <dig> mg tamoxifen show complete gr loss in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal ca <dig> region . the same correlation between copy number and ligand dose was observed in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and in the cortex . however, in the pvn complete loss of gr signal was detected upon injection of  <dig> mg tamoxifen in the presence of two or four copies only, but none of the lines showed complete gr loss if  <dig> mg were applied . taken together, these data demonstrate that increasing copies of the transgene reduce the tamoxifen dose required to achieve recombination.

it has been shown previously, that ablation of gr protein in neurons and glia cells results in a strong elevation of plasma corticosterone  <cit> . the adrenal release of corticosterone is controlled by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis. the feedback regulation of the hpa axis is mediated by gr at the level of the pituitary and pvn  <cit> . since the pvn can be targeted with the camkcreert <dig> transgene, the measurement of plasma corticosterone provides information about the efficiency of the gr ablation using the camkcreert <dig> transgene. therefore, we measured plasma corticosterone of grcamkcreert <dig> animals harboring one, two or four copies of the transgene and their littermate controls  at the circadian trough. all animals were injected with  <dig> mg tamoxifen twice a day for five consecutive days and sacrificed six weeks after the treatment. the mutant mice from all three lines show, as expected, a significant elevation of plasma corticosterone compared to controls . mutant mice, harboring one copy of the transgene display a significant, but rather mild elevation of corticosterone. grcamkcreert <dig> mice with two and four copies of the transgene exhibit an equivalent and compared to mutant animals with one copy of the transgene a stronger elevation of the morning corticosterone level .

discussion
brain-specific gene inactivation using the cre/loxp-recombination system allows to investigate gene function in the adult brain in case the germline inactivation of the gene of interest causes lethality. however, most of the available brain-specific cre-lines show onset of cre expression before the development of the brain is completed  <cit> . therefore, phenotypical changes can result from interferences during brain development and/or from deficiency of the respective protein in the adult brain  <cit> .

to achieve a spatio-temporal control of cre-mediated recombination in the adult brain, regulatory elements of the camkiiα gene have been already used to drive the expression of different cre fusion proteins. the fusion of cre recombinase with a modified ligand-binding domain  of a steroid hormone receptor  allows to regulate nuclear translocation and thereby activity of the cre recombinase by administration of the cognate ligand. expression of cre recombinase fused to a mutated form of the human progesterone receptor-lbd resulted in incomplete recombination within the hippocampal cornu ammonis and the cortex upon ru  <dig> treatment, but no recombination was observed in the dentate gyrus  <cit> . the fusion of a mutated ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor   <cit>  onto both ends of the cre recombinase, expressed under the control of the regulatory elements of the camkiiα gene, resulted in very weak recombination efficiency  upon tamoxifen treatment  <cit> . the fusion of one ert <dig> to the c-terminal end of cre recombinase  <cit>  has been recently employed in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and neural stem cells  <cit> . we have now generated transgenic mouse lines expressing the creert2fusion protein under the control of regulatory elements of the mouse camkiiα gene present on a large genomic dna fragment isolated from a bac library. this transgene allows highly efficient recombination of conditional genes in brain regions shown to be important for learning, memory and synaptic plasticity.

the camkcreert <dig> transgene displays forebrain-specific, copy number-dependent expression and permits inducible site-specific recombination
the use of plasmid-derived transgenes that contain small promoter fragments in front of an expression cassette results in copy number-independent transgene expression. in addition, variable degrees of ectopic and mosaic expression of the transgene is observed  <cit> . the use of bac or yac clones, that contain large regions of genomic dna with almost all regulatory elements of the gene with desired expression in their native configuration, allows expression of the transgene that resembles the expression of the endogenous gene independent of the integration site  <cit> . using the regulatory elements of the mouse camkiiα gene we have generated transgenic mice expressing the creert <dig> fusion protein in neurons of the adult forebrain. we obtained different lines harboring one, two or four copies of the transgene. as expected, the expression pattern of the transgene is identical in all analyzed transgenic lines and shows only copy number-dependent differences at the level of expression.

using the rosa <dig> cre reporter we demonstrated the effective temporal regulation of creert <dig> activity by tamoxifen treatment in all three lines. in absence of the ligand noteworthy constitutive recombination occurs only within the dentate gyrus. application of tamoxifen results in strong recombination within forebrain regions like hippocampus and cortex. using the two-copy line we compared the degree of recombination with the one elicited by the constitutive camkcre line. analysis of β-galactosidase stainings of double transgenic animals harboring a rosa <dig> cre reporter allele and the constitutively active camkcre revealed recombination in the entire brain. however, brain regions that show recombination in both, the constitutive and the inducible cre transgene after tamoxifen treatment, display in the adult brain  a comparable degree of recombination when quantified by southern blot. since both transgenic lines show similar cre expression, independent of the developmental stage, the observed differences in recombination pattern result from the different time period of nuclear cre activity of both transgenes. using a rosa <dig> cre reporter, we observe in case of the constitutive camkcre transgene the accumulated recombination and thereby β-galactosidase staining in all cells where cre was active during development and adulthood until dispatch. therefore, brain regions that show no or only weak cre expression at the adult stage can nevertheless show β-galactosidase staining. in case of the camkcreert <dig> transgene cre is only transiently activated during the presence of tamoxifen. thus the pattern of recombination reflects creert <dig> expression within this time period only.

inducible ablation of gr protein expression in the adult brain depends on the copy number of the cre transgene and the tamoxifen dose
we successfully employed the camkcreert <dig> transgene in combination with a conditional gr allele  to achieve ablation of gr in neurons of the adult forebrain. upon tamoxifen treatment, grcamkcreert <dig> mice show loss of gr protein, whereas vehicle-treated mutants showed no alterations in gr expression compared to wild-type mice, reflecting the very low background activity of the camkcreert <dig> transgene. in addition, we demonstrate for the hippocampus that an increase in transgene copy numbers allows the reduction of the tamoxifen dose required to achieve complete recombination.

using the conditional gr allele we could show that using the two- or four-copy line of the camkcreert <dig> transgene in combination with the injection of  <dig> mg tamoxifen twice per day for five consecutive days results in similar recombination efficiency, leading to complete loss of gr protein in the cortex, hippocampus, pvn and basolateral amygdala as well as a comparable increase of plasma corticosterone. using the same tamoxifen dose the one-copy line displays only partial loss of gr protein in pvn and hippocampus resulting in a milder increase of plasma corticosterone. since bac-derived large genomic dna fragments potentially carry additional genes we will use for further analyses of grcamkcreert <dig> mice two copies of the camkcreert <dig> transgene and apply  <dig> mg tamoxifen twice per day for five consecutive days. moreover, we could induce mr protein loss upon the identical tamoxifen treatment in the brain regions targeted by the camkcreert <dig> transgene using the two-copy line in combination with a conditional mr allele  <cit>  . however, other conditional alleles may require the use of four copies of the camkcreert <dig> transgene in combination with the injection of  <dig> mg tamoxifen twice per day for five consecutive days, to achieve complete recombination.

CONCLUSIONS
the expression of the creert2-fusion protein under control of the regulatory elements of the camkiiα gene  allows inducible gene inactivation in neurons of the adult forebrain with very low background activity and highly efficient targeting upon tamoxifen treatment. the use of a bac-based transgene resulted in a reliable and copy number-dependent transgene expression. by employing the camkcreert <dig> transgene in combination with a conditional gr allele we were able to induce spatially and temporally restricted loss of gr protein dependent on transgene copy number and applied tamoxifen dose.
