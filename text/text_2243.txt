BACKGROUND
insertion sequences  are defined as genomic sequences of “cut-and-paste” mobile dna, typically 800-1300 bp in length, which encode the protein transposase. the transposase protein consists of a dna binding domain and a catalytic site with the ability to excise and to reinsert the is dna sequence into another position, thus moving an is from one location in the genome to another  <cit> . in some situations e.g. during replication, duplications of is elements occur, i.e. “copy-and-paste” rather than “cut-and-paste”, allowing the is elements to multiply and proliferate in the genome  <cit> . as incidents of cut-and-paste events are more difficult to detect than are copy-and-paste incidents, cut-and-paste transpositions are more frequent than implied by the sheer number of is elements observed in a genome. is transpositions commonly leave traces in the form of small, difficult to recognize, 2-20 nt direct repeats at the excision site. insertion sequences accumulate in genomes when the evolutionary pressure is low and when decreases in population size result in genetic drift. they are known to influence the evolution of an organism e.g. through gene activation and inactivation, repression, deletions, rearrangements, recombinations, and gene transfers  <cit> . iss are considered important for driving reductive evolution in host restricted symbiont microbes  <cit> . for instance, clusters of iss in genomic “hot spots” have been shown to be correlated with areas of gene loss and genomic recombinations in the gram positive bacterium frankia, strains of which form mutualistic symbioses with plants  <cit> . the same phenomenon has been observed in the intracellular gram-negative bacterium shigella flexneri  <cit>  and in the eukaryotic tetraodon nigroviridis   <cit> . in “recent” obligate bacterial symbionts the genome reduction is usually small, while the number of insertion sequences tends to be high. in contrast, in ancient symbiosis the norm is bacterial symbionts with small genomes and few or no iss  <cit> .

in the small floating fern azolla  <cit>  , the symbiotic association with the filamentous cyanobacterium ‘nostoc azollae’  <dig>  has developed into an extraordinary tight degree  <cit> . during leaf development in azolla, an extracellular cavity is formed in the leaf. these cavities are in nature always occupied by filaments of noaz. the azolla-noaz symbiosis is obligate for the bacterial symbiont, as noaz is unable to grow outside the plant  <cit>  and thus spends its entire life cycle within the plant. transfer of the cyanobiont  to new plant generations is facilitated by a unique vertical transfer mechanism. upon formation of the azolla megasporocarp, the female seed-like reproductive structure of azolla, filaments of noaz are attracted to and enter into a specific ‘chamber’ in this structure, where they reside in a dormant form until germination  <cit> . when the megasporocarp germinates and develops into new plantlets, the bacterial inoculum differentiates into mobile cells that colonize developing leaf cavities. inside the cavities, they differentiate again, forming the nitrogen-fixing cell type termed heterocysts that deliver fixed nitrogen to the plant, thereby satisfying the nitrogen need of the plant.figure  <dig>

due to these intriguing characters we recently sequenced the noaz genome  <cit> . analysis of the genome revealed characteristics of a genome in severe reduction, such as a large number of pseudogenes , a low gc content  and genomic streamlining around functions generating critical services for the noaz-azolla symbiosis, such as those related to nitrogen fixation. we thus proposed that noaz is forced into an irreversible path of reductive evolution, as also observed in other obligate bacteria-eukaryote symbioses  <cit> , likely to end in a severely reduced genome as seen in ancient symbionts. the cyanobiont will eventually loose autonomy, thereby starting to resemble organelles, such as chloroplasts, that once originated from cyanobacteria  <cit> . presently, it is unknown if any noaz genes has been transferred to the plant nucleus as was the case for chloroplasts. secreted vesicles containing dna has been observed in the azolla leaf cavity,  <cit>  and extant chloroplasts may have evolved from a filamentous nitrogen-fixing heterocystous cyanobacterium of the same type as noaz  <cit> , which suggests that dna transfer is possible.

more than  <dig> locations with repeated sequences classified as insertion sequences were observed in the noaz genome  <cit> . here we define a particular dna sequence encoding a transposase as an “insertion sequence” . an is is usually present in multiple copies in a genome. we term these copies “is elements”. hence, is elements are the physical copies containing the is dna sequence, which in turn may have accumulated mutations leading to changes in sequence and length.

is element abundance in genomes is proposed to be linked to the high number of pseudogenes observed in some is rich organisms  <cit> . this pseudogenization may in turn make a symbiont dependent on the host organism and thereby promote the intimacy of the symbiosis.

to further our understanding of events that shaped the eroding genome of noaz, and the role of the iss discovered, we examined the identity and distribution of iss in the noaz genome in relation to the distribution of pseudogenes. to gain perspective, the is and pseudogene distribution in the genome of noaz was compared to  <dig> other sequenced free-living and symbiotic cyanobacteria. moreover, nine symbiotic bacteria from a wide range of eukaryotic hosts, were also included in our analysis: wolbachia  <cit> , yersinia pestis  <cit> , frankia  <cit> , candidatus amoebophilus asiaticus  <cit> , bordetella pertussis  <cit> , orientia tsutsugamushi  <cit> , shigella flexneri  <cit> , mycoplasma mycoides  <cit> , and onion yellows phytoplasma  <cit>  .table  <dig>

the results show that noaz has a high portion of its genome occupied by is elements:  <dig> %, which is just below the proportion in o. tsutsugamushi , but higher than in any of the other symbiotic organism investigated. still, some non-symbiotic cyanobacteria had higher or equal is contents to that of noaz, e.g. the unicellular crocosphaera watsonii  and microcystis aeruginosa , pointing to multiple roles and consequences of is elements in free-living and symbiotic bacteria. the observed co-location of is elements and pseudogenes, as well as the tendency for some is elements to perform “local hopping” suggests a model for the role of iss in reductive evolution which is discussed.

RESULTS
using the repeat identification software, blast and in-house python scripts, a total of  <dig> different repeated sequences of a length above 500 bp  were identified in the totally  <dig> bacterial genomes investigated . these  <dig> repeated sequences comprised  <dig> copies or fragments in the genomes. of the  <dig> repeated sequences, about half or  <dig> sequences  belonged to previously annotated iss identified and catalogued on the isfinder website  <cit> . of the remaining  <dig> sequences, the majority or  <dig> sequences  showed similarities to known is sequences. of the total number of repeats, fifty sequences  appeared to be of phage origin. these were found almost exclusively in wolbachia, o. tsutsugamushi and ‘onion yellows phytoplasma’, with phage contents of 2-6% of the genomes. ‘onion yellows phytoplasma’ with the smallest genome,  <dig>  mbp, still diverted  <dig> % of its genome to be occupied by is elements and phages, and was the only organism with more phage remains than is elements.figure  <dig>

sixty-one sequences  were putatively self-replicating because of their high copy numbers and/or similarities to genes with functions related to gene replication or transposition, e.g. endonucleases, rna directed dna polymerases and helicases. each group of repeats contributed to the total amount as illustrated in figure 3a. repeats with is characteristics were predominant both in diversity  and abundance .figure  <dig>

the repeats showed considerable fragmentation: of the total number of is elements in the  <dig> genomes examined 31% showed a length over 95% of its reference sequence, and 37% of the repeats were less than 15% of the sequence length .

insertion sequences in noaz
in noaz, a total of  <dig> is elements occupied  <dig> % of the total genome. these is elements were in various states of preservation, but the majority had a length ≥ 95% of its corresponding is sequence. at the same time, a total of  <dig> genes were annotated as pseudogenes in the noaz genome, almost double the amount annotated in any other bacterium examined here.

the size of the noaz genome with all is elements removed is  <dig>  mbps, which is considerably larger than the is-free genome size of its two closest free-living cyanobacterial relatives raphidiopsis brookii  and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii . however, if the  <dig> pseudogenes in noaz , are also removed the sizes start to match.

copies of the same is tended to cluster together in the genome of noaz, or to be absent from a large region . is elements in close proximity to each other were also more similar in nucleotide identity than were is elements distant from each other . in some cases, the most proximal iss on the chromosome were also closest in terms of sequence identity  .figure  <dig>

as seen in the graphical representations of is element and pseudogene positions in the noaz genome these are frequently located in proximity to each other . this is to some degree due to the tendency for is elements, many of which are pseudogenes, to cluster  in the genome. however, it is apparent that both other is elements and regular genes are pseudogenized in the vicinity of is elements . exceptions are genes that are presumably critical to symbiotic functions, which are maintained intact despite their proximity to presumably active is elements .figure  <dig>

insertion sequences in other cyanobacteria
the high is concentration in noaz  is unique among the seven multicellular and highly differentiated heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria investigated . in fact, noaz contains more than three times more is elements than these close relatives, whether symbiotic or free-living. in contrast, some more distantly related and less differentiated  relatives showed is contents equal to or exceeding that of noaz. the is content of the single-celled microcystis aeruginosa and crocosphaera watsonii were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. c. watsonii is an abundant oceanic nitrogen-fixer  <cit> , while m. aeruginosa is a widespread toxin producing freshwater species unable to fix nitrogen. moreover, in some cases, closely related cyanobacteria show extreme differences in is content. this is the case within the genus arthrospira, with the halophilic a. maxima having an is density of  <dig> %, versus the freshwater arthrospira platensis with merely a  <dig> % is density and also in c. watsonii  versus the recently discovered nitrogen-fixing but symbiotic cyanobacterium ucyn-a  <cit>  . this is also the case for noaz and its two close relatives c. raciborskii and r. brookii, with the former showing  <dig> is hits per mbp, comparable to  <dig> is hits per mbp in noaz. on the other hand, the c. raciborskii fragments are truncated to a larger extent , making the fraction of the is occupied genome significantly smaller  than in noaz. while the two arthrospira species occupy widely different habitats  the differences in is abundance in the two fresh-water species c. raciborskii and r. brookii cannot be attributed to different life styles.figure  <dig>

notably, the is abundance in cyanobacteria does not correlate with either symbiotic state, morphology or phylogeny, iss rather appear to be particularly prevalent in the clade comprising complex cyanobacteria with large genomes . clade  <dig>  which consists exclusively of single-celled species with small cell size and streamlined genomes, such as marine prochlorococcus and synechococcus, are almost completely devoid of is elements or dna repeats of any kind .

insertion sequences in non-cyanobacterial species
symbiotic bacteria outside the cyanobacterial phylum showed a wide range of is densities,  <dig> - <dig> %, with a median of  <dig> % . as in cyanobacteria, genomes with a high is frequency also tended to have a large proportion of full length is elements. most symbiotic bacteria also contained a high proportion of pseudogenes in their genomes, 6-12%, i.e. a considerably higher frequency than in cyanobacteria . bacteria belonging to the gram positive genus frankia in general contained low densities of is elements, 1-2%, and few pseudogenes, except for the symbiont of datisca with 5% is elements and 7% pseudogenes.

repeat fragmentation
among the bacteria with a relatively high repeat density , full-length is elements were in majority . bacteria with a low density of is elements showed a larger proportion of fragmented is elements, with lengths <50% of the reference sequence. the occurrence of intact is elements in is rich genomes is particularly obvious in noaz, where over 40% of the is elements being full-length. yet another example is in the difference between a. maxima, with  <dig> % is elements, out of which 30% is full-length and its closest relative a. platensis with only  <dig> % is elements, and  <dig> % full-length is elements.

new is elements
full length-copies of  <dig> previously annotated iss were identified in our investigation. for example, is <dig>  <cit>  and is100kyp from y. pestis, is <dig>  <cit>  from the free-living cyanobacterium nostoc pcc  <dig> and isnpu <dig> – isnpu <dig> found in the symbiotically competent cyanobacterium n. punctiforme  <cit> . another  <dig> previously annotated iss were found as fragments, being <95% of their full lengths.

in addition, a number of previously unannotated  repeats were identified in the  <dig> genomes . for instance,  <dig> previously unannotated putative iss were found in noaz, perhaps not surprising considering its high frequency of is elements. the found sequences in noaz varied widely as for previously identified iss. for example, noaz_r_ <dig> is 86% identical to the nucleotide sequence of the previously annotated isava <dig>  while noaz_r_ <dig> is a “hypothetical protein” where only a stretch of  <dig> amino acids are similar  to known iss. the is repeats in noaz were most similar to previously identified iss from close relatives: n. punctiforme , anabaena variabilis , or from other is-rich cyanobacteria: acaryochloris marina  and c. watsonii .

unannotated putative iss were also found previously annotated genomes. for instance, the sequence npun_r_ <dig> found in n. punctiforme was present in  <dig> full-length copies, and wolana_r_ <dig>  a  <dig> long hypothetical protein, was found in  <dig> full-length copies in the wolbachia genomes. the unicellular free-living cyanobacterium m. aeruginosa contained the highest frequency of unannotated iss, with at least thirty sequences clearly of is character. at least one is in noaz, noaz_r_ <dig>  appeared spread among close relatives. this is <dig> family is, with  <dig> full-length repeats in noaz, has well-preserved  copies in cyanobacteria such as n. punctiforme, anabaena cylindrica, calothrix sp. pcc  <dig> and calothrix sp. pcc  <dig> 

insertion sequences display ‘local hopping’
it has previously been reported that some iss in escherichia coli transpose short distances rather than moving randomly across the genome  <cit> . this appears to hold true for some of the iss in noaz as well . to determine whether these patterns exist in other bacteria, linear regression tests were performed on  <dig> of the most frequent iss in the investigation. uncorrected p-distances between two is elements in the genomes were tested as a variable dependent on the length of nucleotides that separated them . seventeen of the  <dig> iss investigated showed significant positive relationships between separation of the genome and p-distance. these  <dig> iss tended to be less similar to each other the further they were separated. on average, the uncorrected p-distance between two is elements decreased with  <dig> - <dig> percentage unit per mbp as their distance from each other increased. this means that 1- <dig> base pairs have mutated for every mbp of separation . tests searching for a negative correlation were not found. a tendency to perform “local hopping” is particularly apparent in noaz. ten is species in noaz, out of twenty investigated, showed a significant negative correlation between alignment similarity and genomic separation. when the  <dig>  <dig> pairs of is elements from the  <dig> iss were tested together, an average change in uncorrected p-distance of - <dig>  percentage units per mbp of distance was found using linear regression, with a p-value of  <dig> e- <dig> 

pseudogenes in proximity to insertion sequences
a graphical representations of the genome in noaz illustrating the comparatively high numbers of is elements and pseudogenes, revealed a pattern with pseudogenes appearing more frequently in the vicinity of is elements. to test if this applied to other organisms, the average number of pseudogenes near is elements was computed in the  <dig> genomes and compared to the average number of pseudogenes near regular genes. the test showed a significant positive correlation increase  in the average number of pseudogenes close to is elements, in comparison to the average number of pseudogenes in the vicinity of regular genes. in noaz there appeared to be, on average, >30% more pseudogenes within  <dig> kbp of an is element. this enrichment dropped to below 5% at a  <dig> kbp distance and became undetectable at  <dig> kbp distance . similar patterns were apparent in the majority of the investigated organisms holding a sufficient number of is elements and pseudogenes make statistical relevant  differences , such as n. punctiforme, all frankia species except frankia acn, and most cyanothece. orientia tsutsugamushi showed significant pseudogene enrichment in the  <dig> kbp closest to is elements, while the cyanobacterium a. variabilis and the bacteria b. pertussis, c. amoebophilus, m. mycoides, s. flexneri and the wolbachia symbionts showed the same trend but with lower significance .figure  <dig>

the average enrichment of pseudogenes ranged from 20% to 200% within the first  <dig> kbp distance from is elements and dropped to a fourth of this at  <dig> kbp distance. at  <dig> kbp distance from is elements, most of the investigated organisms showed no statistically significant pseudogene enrichment additional file 5).

discussion
when a bacterium is sheltered by a “host” organism, the host typically provide functions originally handled by the microorganism, making some genes in the symbiont superfluous. such redundant genes may be colonized by mobile dna elements and interrupted. the damage to the microorganism fitness is then minimal as it lives in a relaxed habitat of a eukaryotic host, plant or animal. the presence of superfluous genes may thus lead to an increase in the number of is elements in the genome, as there may be no negative consequence and as these genes offer sites for safe insertion of is elements. however, a large number of active is elements in the symbiont means a greater risk for critical genes being negatively affected or even destroyed by transposition events, hampering the behaviour of the microorganisms and leading to slower growth of the symbiont. this may, up to a point, be beneficial to the host, as it may benefit from a fixed small bacterial population rather than a freely expanding one.

decreases in is abundance is facilitated in two ways, via i) inactivation of insertion elements by natural mutations and by pseudogenization, sometimes brought about by other is elements, and via ii) deletions of large regions of the genome through recombination events. bacteria seem to have a bias towards genome reduction  <cit> , and the presence of many repeated elements may itself help to reduce genome sizes by providing repeated sequences able to participate in homologous recombinations.

other investigators have focused on genetic exchange as a major factor for is abundance, and argue that facultative symbionts should have a high is abundance because of genetic inflow from their symbiotic partners, while obligate symbionts should have a low frequency of iss due to their isolation. this trend was proven in an investigation of  <dig> bacterial genomes in  <cit> . however, the organisms investigated here do not show the same trend, instead obligate symbionts harboured more is elements than facultative symbionts. this difference may be due to a smaller and more biased set of genomes analysed here, but it could also be a result of the relaxed selection pressure that are imposed on early obligate endosymbionts before their genomes become smaller and more vulnerable to change. since noaz is an obligate inhabitant of a semi-open cavity shared with other microorganisms  <cit> , the is content is likely influenced both by a relaxed selection pressure and genetic exchange.

the genome of the symbiont of azolla suggests that it may be in the middle of an evolutionary scenario of is-mediated reductive evolution. this is concluded from the fact that it holds a high portion of is elements and pseudogenes, while for instance its nitrogen-fixing function  are still preserved  <cit> . as many of the iss in the noaz genome are present in high copy numbers , and the majority of is elements found are full length, noaz may have an active contingent of is elements that continue to shape its genome. an active is population is however not limited to noaz: several other of the investigated bacteria, both symbiotic and free-living, show a considerable level of is elements, and also tend to have a high proportion of full-length copies. in free-living organisms, functions lost due to is insertions cannot be substituted by a symbiotic host, and hence, other mechanisms of surviving contingents of active iss in the genome must be in operation. one mechanism may be to hold extended ‘safe’ genomic portions unaffected by is element insertions e.g. non-coding regions, or to allow some degree of is insertions, e.g. in duplicated genes of larger genomes. many is-rich cyanobacteria do show a large number of paralogous genes  <cit> , and most of the other is rich relatives analysed here have genome sizes above average even for clade i cyanobacteria . large and flexible genomes may also be prone to take up ‘compensatory’ genomic material from the environment via horizontal gene transfer which may outweigh the loss of productivity caused by lethal is insertions. compared to noaz and non-cyanobacterial symbionts, the free-living cyanobacteria investigated here show a considerably lower number of pseudogenes, with the exception of the filamentous cyanobacterium t. erythraeum. although differences in pseudogene annotation cannot be ruled out, such data suggest a higher sensitivity to pseudogenization in free-living organisms and that individuals with a high load of pseudogenes simply do not survive.

the tendency for pseudogenes to appear in proximity to is elements highlights the dynamic nature of “cut-and-paste” mobile genetic elements. genomes with high levels of intact is elements represent snapshots of is positions at this moment in time, and these is elements may have transposed in recent evolutionary time. we propose here that the pseudogenes observed close to is elements in noaz, as well as in the other organisms, may be genomic scars from recently transposed is elements, currently located some distance away. this behaviour of ‘local hopping’ and pseudogenization would favour reductive evolution of the genome, as regions containing superfluous genes will accumulate is elements. this in turn will i) increase the chance of inactivation of genes in the same genomic region and ii) increase the number of repeated sequences in the region, thus increasing deletion instances of this area. proximity between is elements and pseudogenes also implies a higher risk for pseudogenes than for functional genes to be included in a deleted region.

since it is not known how much of the noaz genome that is still superfluous to the contemporary noaz-azolla symbiosis, it is hard to determine whether the is concentration in the genome of noaz is still increasing, or whether it has reached a stable is population fit for this particular plant symbiosis at this stage. along with the deletion of pseudogenes and superfluous regions, the number of safe spaces for is insertion will decrease, which in turn will increase the risk for hosting active is elements and favouring their inactivation and ultimate deletion. our estimates predict that the genome of noaz will decrease a conservative estimate of at least  <dig> mbp, once all is elements and pseudogenes have been removed, leaving a genome size of approximately  <dig>  mbps.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that the  <dig> verified or putative species of is elements in the symbiotic cyanobacterium noaz cover  <dig> % of its genome, which is comparable to the is density in the obligately symbiotic pathogens o. tsutsugamushi  and mycoplasma mycoides, but notably also to the is frequency in the free-living cyanobacteria m. aeruginosa and c. watsonii.

the prevalence of pseudogenes is linked to the prevalence of is elements, and we suggest that the is-proximal pseudogenes may be the result of “local hopping” of the is elements. we propose that this process facilitates the reductive evolution discovered recently  <cit>  not only in noaz/azolla but also in other well-studied symbiotic bacteria such as wolbachia and o. tsutsugamushi.
