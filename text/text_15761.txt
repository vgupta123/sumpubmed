BACKGROUND
recent developments of high-throughput profiling techniques, such as yeast two-hybrid  and tandem affinity purification  with mass spectrometry , allow scientists to generate large-scale protein-protein interaction  datasets for different species . these interactome data have enabled us to discover biological insights from a systematic point of view through ppi networks, where nodes represent proteins and edges denote biological relationships  between two proteins. in this paper, we focus on predicting protein complexes in derived ppi networks from high-throughput profiling.

based on the inherent topological structures of protein complexes  <cit> , prediction of protein complexes can be formulated as searching for subnetworks that are densely connected inside and well separated from the rest of the ppi networks. many algorithms have been developed and applied for this purpose of detecting protein complexes.

these existing algorithms can be grouped into three categories. the first category includes the algorithms that mimic markovian random walk on graphs, pioneered by mcl  <cit> . mcl does not have explicit mathematical definitions for the desired properties of subnetworks to detect as protein complexes. similar to random walk, it iteratively implements “expand” and “inflation” operations to generate non-overlapping complexes. r-mcl  <cit>  and sr-mcl  <cit>  are improved versions of mcl. r-mcl penalizes the large complexes at each iteration in order to obtain more size-balanced complexes with a similar number of nodes within them. sr-mcl executes r-mcl many times to yield overlapping complexes. all those algorithms have shown good empirical performance, despite the mystery of parameter tuning and the lack of theoretic understanding of their working mechanisms.

algorithms in the second category do not directly predict complexes according to the topological structure of subnetworks but resemble traditional clustering methods based on derived similarity measures between nodes or edges. for example, mcode  <cit> , cfinder  <cit> , and rrw  <cit>  grow complexes from single nodes by iteratively adding similar nodes in terms of different similarity criteria that help form local dense subnetworks. however, they only concentrate on the internal connectivity of the subnetworks and neglect the connectivity between the subnetworks and the rest of the networks. linkcomm  <cit>  represents networks with edge graphs, whose nodes are interactions and edges reflect the similarity between interactions, and derives potential complexes by hierarchical clustering to partition the edge graphs.

algorithms in the third category detect complexes based on explicit topological definitions of protein complexes. for example, modularity  <cit>  and conductance  <cit>  are two widely used definitions. algorithms based on modularity  <cit>  aim to detect subnetworks that have higher than expected internal connections. and algorithms, such as clusterone  <cit> , based on finding low-conductance sets, focus on the separability of the subnetworks, which can be quantified by the ratios between the external connections of subnetworks and the total number of interactions of the proteins within the subnetworks. however, these methods have their own limitations. modularity-based methods have the inherent resolution problem  <cit> , which leads to ignorance of small-size protein complexes. algorithms based on conductance minimization  <cit>  consider the relationships between the internal connections and the external connections of subnetworks, but neglect the density of the interactions within the subnetworks.

in this paper, we propose a two-step algorithm flcd  to detect protein complexes that have dense interactions inside and sparse interactions outside in a given ppi network. flcd explicitly takes care of both the internal and external connectivity of protein complexes in two steps. flcd first identifies a low-conductance set around a protein, which is locally well separated from the rest of the network. then a densely connected subnetwork within the low-conductance set is detected based on the definition of the edge density of a subnetwork proposed in  <cit> . we compare our flcd with three state-of-the-art overlapping complex prediction algorithms, which are clusterone  <cit> , linkcomm  <cit> , and sr-mcl  <cit> , respectively. experimental results on four different yeast ppi networks from different publicly accessible databases demonstrate that our flcd outperforms all competing algorithms for biological significance in terms of yeast protein complex gold standards and gene ontology  term annotations  <cit> .

RESULTS
we first introduce the implementation details of the algorithms that we take for comparison; the information of the ppi networks, the reference protein complex datasets as our gold standards, and the go terms we use for evaluation; and the criteria for the performance comparison. in order to demonstrate the robust performance of flcd, we then compare predicted protein complexes from three selected state-of-the-art protein complex prediction algorithms based on two golden standard protein complex datasets on four public yeast ppi networks. what’s more, we apply go enrichment analysis to the entire set of detected complexes by all the competing algorithms. at the end, we illustrate differences between protein complexes predicted by all competing algorithms corresponding to specific reference complexes to further demonstrate the superiority of our flcd.

algorithms, data, and evaluation metrics
algorithms
we compare our flcd algorithm with other three state-of-the-art overlapping complex prediction algorithms, which are clusterone  <cit> , linkcomm  <cit> , and sr-mcl  <cit> . the java implementation of clusterone does not require any tuning parameters. for linkcomm, we set the tuning parameter t  to  <dig>  that achieves the best performance empirically in our experiments. for sr-mcl, we set the inflation parameter i= <dig> and other parameters to their default settings since they yield the best results in our experiments. we set the only parameter k of our flcd, the size of local neighbors based on personalized pagerank computation, to  <dig> 

data
we take four yeast ppi networks for performance evaluation: scedip, scebg, sceintact, and scemint, extracted respectively from the database of interacting proteins   <cit> , the biological general repository for interaction datasets   <cit> , the intact molecular interaction database   <cit> , and the molecular interaction database   <cit> . we note that we only consider protein-protein interactions by removing all genetic interactions from scebg. we download the protein complex gold standards from the supplementary data in  <cit> , which are obtained from the saccharomyces genome database   <cit>  and the munich information center for protein sequences   <cit>  databases. for each ppi network, we remove reference protein complexes if their size smaller than  <dig> or half of the proteins of them are not in the network. the detailed information of four ppi networks and the gold standard reference complex datasets are provided in table  <dig> 



due to the possible incompleteness of the reference protein complexes, we further examine the biological relevance of every predicted complex by go enrichment analysis. we download the mappings of yeast genes and proteins to go terms according to  <cit>  .

evaluation metrics for protein complex prediction
for the protein complex prediction, we assess the performance of all competing algorithms by a composite score consisting of three quality measures: f-measure  <cit> ; the geometric accuracy  score  <cit> ; and the maximum matching ratio   <cit> . for fair comparison, we remove predicted complexes of two or fewer proteins by all competing algorithms.

for a gold standard reference protein complex set c={c
 <dig> c
 <dig> …,c
n} and a set of predicted complexes s={s
 <dig> s
 <dig> …,s
m}, the f-measure is defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall defined as follows: 
  <dig> precision=|ncs||s|;recall=|ncp||c|, 


in which n
cs={s
i∈s|n
a≥ <dig> ,∃c
j∈c} is the set of the complexes that match to one or more reference protein complexes; |n
cs| is the size of the set n
cs. n
cp={c
i∈c|n
a≥ <dig> ,∃s
j∈s} is a set of reference protein complexes that are matched by predicted complexes. we consider a reference protein complex c
j is matched by a predicted complex s
j if n
a≥ <dig>   <cit> , where na=|ci∩sj|2|ci|×|sj| is called neighborhood affinity. finally, the f-measure is 
  <dig> f-measure=2×precision∗recallprecision+recall. 


the geometric accuracy  score is the geometric mean of two other measures — the cluster-wise sensitivity  and cluster-wise positive predictive value   <cit> . given m predicted and n reference complexes, let t
ij denote the number of proteins that exist in both predicted complex s
i and reference complex c
j, and w
j represent the number of proteins in reference complex c
j. then sn and ppv can be computed as 
  <dig> sn=∑j=1nmaxi= <dig> …,mtij∑j=1nwj;ppv=∑i=1mmaxj= <dig> …,ntij∑i=1m∑j=1ntij. 


the acc score provides a balanced measure of sn and ppv: acc=sn×ppv.

the maximum matching ratio  is the ratio of the weight of maximum weight matching to the size of the reference set.

go enrichment analysis
suppose that a given ppi network has n proteins with m proteins annotated with one go term and the predicted complex has n proteins with m proteins annotated with the same go term. the p-value of the complex enriched with that go term can be calculated as similarly done in  <cit> : 
  <dig> p-value=∑i=mnmin−mn−inn. 


we choose the lowest p-value of all its enriched go terms for a predicted complex as its final p-value. a go term is statistically significantly enriched when the p-value of any complex corresponding to this go term is lower than 1e− <dig> 

comparison on protein complex prediction
we apply all competing algorithms to search for potential protein complexes in four yeast ppi networks and compare them in terms of the composite score, consisting of f-measure, acc score and mmr based on both the sgd and mips reference protein complex datasets.

we note that the different sizes and different numbers of detected complexes would affect the scores for the metrics that we have employed. however, in the context of complex prediction, there is no universal gold-standard metric. hence, we apply three aforementioned metrics that have been commonly adopted in many other related works  <cit> . we also note that the average sizes of the complexes generated by flcd in our experiments are from  <dig> to  <dig> for four networks under study. the average complex sizes are indeed comparable to the average sizes of detected complexes by other algorithms. for example, the average sizes of complexes produced by linkcommunity are from  <dig> to 6; the average sizes of complexes produced by clusterone are from  <dig> to 9; the average sizes of complexes produced by sr-mcl are from  <dig> to  <dig>  furthermore, the total numbers of predicted complexes yielded by flcd, linkcommunity and sr-mcl are much larger than that of clusterone. the reason is that the post-processing procedure of clusterone filters out complexes with lower scores but flcd and linkcommunity output all complexes without filtering.

as shown in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  flcd clearly outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms for all four networks on both sgd and mips reference datasets. therefore, the complexes detected by flcd have the best correspondence with the reference datasets. the detailed evaluation scores in figs.  <dig> and  <dig> are displayed in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

when we take sgd reference dataset as our gold standard protein complexes, from table  <dig>  we find that flcd consistently achieves the best mmr scores among all competing algorithms because flcd is the only algorithm that can capture the desired network structure of protein complexes. in the table, we also compare f-measure and the precision and recall scores that are used to compute f-measure. we observe that for all four ppi networks, flcd predicts the largest number of matched reference protein complexes, and therefore flcd attains the best recall scores for all ppi networks. with respect to the precision score, flcd is the best for scemint but clusterone performs the best for the rest. however, since the post-processing step in clusterone only keeps the dense complexes, clusterone has low coverage. based on the precision and recall scores, we find that flcd attains the best f-measures for scedip and scemint ppi networks and clusterone obtains the best scores for scebg and sceintact ppi networks. in addition to mmr and f-measure, we show comparison on the cluster-wise sensitivity , the cluster-wise positive predictive value  and the acc score. we notice that flcd has the best acc scores for scebg and sceintact. linkcomm obtains the best acc scores for scedip and scemint, since linkcomm detects several large-size and many small-size complexes, which favors both the sn and ppv scores  <cit> . we also compare the coverage of the competing algorithms and notice that sr-mcl has the largest coverage and flcd has competitive coverage to sr-mcl. here, the coverage is defined as the number of proteins covered by all predicted complexes, which is typically used to evaluate whether complex prediction algorithms can help comprehensively predict functionalities for all the proteins in a given network.

for mips reference dataset, we notice the similar trend for the evaluation scores in table  <dig>  flcd finds the largest number of matched reference complexes in mips and attains the best recall scores, f-measures and mmr scores for all four ppi networks. the acc scores of flcd are competitive to linkcomm, which achieves the best acc scores for all four yeast ppi networks. flcd covers the competitive number of proteins to sr-mcl, which covers the largest number of proteins in all four yeast ppi networks. however, by the overall performance, which is represented by the composite score, flcd is superior to other competing algorithms as shown in fig.  <dig> 

in summary, considering the composite score based on three metrics, our flcd outperforms the other algorithms. to further validate all competing algorithms, we perform go enrichment analysis in the next section to see whether all predicted complexes by different algorithms have significant biological meaning.

comparison on go enrichment analysis
we perform go enrichment analysis for all protein complexes predicted by the competing algorithms and report the percentages of the predicted protein complexes that are significantly enriched with at least one go term and the total number of go terms that are enriched in the predicted complexes in table  <dig>  we find that our flcd achieves the best percentages of the enriched predicted protein complexes in scedip and sceintact ppi networks. clusterone obtains the best percentages for scebg and scemint ppi networks but with the smaller number of go terms enriched in the detected complexes because clusterone may remove meaningful functional modules in its post-processing step. furthermore, the protein complexes detected by flcd are significantly associated with the largest number of go terms over all competing algorithms on all four ppi networks.

to further examine the statistical significance of the complexes detected by the competing algorithms, we compare the p-values of the complexes under go terms of biological process, molecular function, and cellular component domains. we use the lowest p-value for each predicted complex and show the comparison of the statistical significance of the complexes detected by all competing algorithms in fig.  <dig>  the y-axis of fig.  <dig> represents the negative log-p-values while the x-axis is the ordered list of the complexes detected by all competing algorithms in terms of their negative log-p-values. since complexes with significant biological relevance have lower p-values, higher values in fig.  <dig> represent the higher quality of the detected complexes. as shown in fig.  <dig>  for all four yeast ppi networks, in addition to the fact that flcd detects significantly more go-enriched complexes, flcd clearly outperforms other competing algorithms because the curves of flcd are consistently on top of the others. the outperformance of flcd further demonstrates that network structure that has dense internal connectivity and sparse external connectivity can better depict complexes of biological significance and flcd provides an effective way to predict complexes with the desired network structure through explicitly taking care of internal and external connectivity of potential subnetworks.

examples of predicted complexes
we further show the differences between the competing algorithms by illustrating the predicted complexes corresponding to two specific reference protein complexes. the first reference protein complex is the smc5-smc <dig> complex. in fig.  <dig>  the smc5-smc <dig> complexes predicted by flcd, clusterone, linkcomm, and sr-mcl are displayed from  to , respectively. we notice that flcd successfully identifies the smc5-smc <dig> complex as shown in fig.  <dig>  clusterone fails to detect the protein annotated as nse <dig>  probably due to the inaccuracy of the greedy algorithm used in clusterone. also, we find that the protein annotated as gex <dig> only interacts with the protein nse <dig> but it is falsely added to the smc5-smc <dig> complex by clusterone. because clusterone focuses on the separability of a complex but does not directly consider the internal density of the complex, it may mistakenly add proteins with small degrees into the final result. the complex in fig.  <dig> predicted by linkcomm contains false positives and false negatives since the similarities between interactions used in linkcomm can not describe the topological structure of protein complexes. in fig  <dig>  we find out that the smc5-smc <dig> complex predicted by sr-mcl consists of many false positives. however, it is hard to explain the performance of sr-mcl on predicting the smc5-smc <dig> complex due to the unclear working mechanism of sr-mcl.

similarly, we show the predicted rnase complexes by all competing algorithms in fig.  <dig> from  to . in , we observe that flcd detects all proteins in the reference rnase complex but mistakenly includes the protein ski <dig> due to the existence of false positive interactions between ski <dig> and proteins in rnase complex. in addition to ski <dig>  the predicted complex by clusterone ) contains two false positive proteins with very small degrees due to the ignorance of the internal density. because linkcomm does not explicitly characterize the separability of the complexes, it also recruits some false positive proteins as clearly shown in fig.  <dig>  for the complex obtained by sr-mcl, we note that it has lots of false positive proteins and the topological property of the predicted complex is not clear.

CONCLUSIONS
we propose an algorithm flcd to predict protein complexes in protein-protein interaction networks. flcd can better characterize the topological structure of a protein complex, which is densely connected inside and well separated from the rest of the networks. we compare flcd with other three state-of-the-art algorithms on protein complex prediction. the comparison results show that flcd achieves superior performances. furthermore, go enrichment analysis of the results of the competing algorithms demonstrates that flcd finds more biologically meaningful complexes, within which proteins tend to be in the same cellular components and have similar functions and/or participate in the same biological processes.
