BACKGROUND
hainan island, the second largest island of china, is located in the beibu bay  and separated from guangdong's leizhou peninsula to the north by the qiongzhou strait . during the last glacial maximum , around  <dig> -  <dig>  kya   <cit> , hainan island was connected with mainland southern china and northern vietnam, as the sea level was around  <dig> -  <dig> m below present day  <cit> . thus, hainan island might lay on one of the modern human northward migration routes from southeast asia to east asia and it is likely that hainan islanders may maintain certain ancient footprints of these dispersals  <cit> . this scenario has been supported by some recent archaeological evidence, which suggested that hainan island might have been colonized by human in the upper pleistocene or the upper paleolithic period  <cit> .

due to the post-glacial sea level rising and the formation of the qiongzhou strait, hainan island has been isolated from the mainland for at least  <dig> thousand years  <cit> . presently, hainan island is home to people with many different languages and/or cultures. compared with other ethnic/linguistic groups  - the recent immigrants from mainland southern china  <cit> , li  people were suggested to be the earliest settlers, having arrived in hainan island at least  <dig> kya  <cit> . in terms of linguistic analyses, the hlai language, used by the li people was suggested to split from other languages within the tai-kadai  family ~  <dig> -  <dig> kya  <cit> . meanwhile, some current li populations still maintain some ancient cultures of the neolithic, e.g. bark cloth and original ceramic making  <cit> . therefore, colonization of hainan island by the ancestors of the li people can be at least traced back to the neolithic period   <cit> . however, whether the ancestor of the modern human had settled in this region in the upper pleistocene and contributed to the gene pool of modern li populations in hainan island is unclear.

to depict the prehistoric peopling events in this region, human genetic approaches based on the uniparental genetic systems - mitochondrial dna  and the nonrecombining region of the y chromosome  - have been widely adopted  <cit> . by analyzing the dominant nry haplogroups  o1a* and o2a* in hainan aborigines , li et al. suggested that hainan aborigines had been isolated at the entrance to east asia for ~  <dig> thousand years  <cit> . however, because of the relatively poor resolution of phylogeny based on limited numbers of y-snps, the candidate founders of the ancient dispersal were still ambiguous. moreover, in their later work about o1a*, wide connections among the populations around the beibu bay  and other populations from southern china and southeast asia were observed  <cit> . this implies that the effect of some recent gene flows between hainan islanders and the populations in the mainland could not be ignored.

in this study, we adopted mtdna analyses to trace the ancient peopling of hainan island in a maternal perspective, because: 1) the phylogeny of mtdna in context of east asian and southeast asian has been improved thanks to large scale complete mtdna genome sequencing  <cit> ; 2) mtdna data of many ethnic/linguistic groups in the neighboring regions of hainan island  have been reported. given that the maternal structures of the li populations were poorly characterized in previous work  <cit> , we collected new samples from  <dig> li individuals. with comprehensive phylogeographic analyses based on complete mtdna genomes sequencing, we identified some potential candidate markers for the early peopling of hainan island, which could be traced back to ~  <dig> -  <dig> kya.

RESULTS
the phylogeny of mtdna in hainan island
hypervariable sequence  analysis and partial coding region testing indicated that all mtdna lineages of the  <dig> li individuals were unambiguously assigned into the previously defined haplogroups in east and southeast asians . the predominant haplogroups in southern china and southeast asia: haplogroups b, f, and m <dig> together account for ~ 69%, 71%, and 63% of the maternal gene pools of the populations li-bt, li-ld, and li-qz, respectively . the prevailing haplogroups in northern china, such as haplogroups a, d <dig>  g, and z, were rare or even absent in the three li populations. meanwhile, the previously reported  <dig> sequences from five populations  in hainan island  <cit>  were re-evaluated and incorporated into further analyses. the skeleton of the resulting phylogeny of  <dig> individuals from hainan island was constructed . the mtdna haplogroups profiles of the hainan islanders were similar to the patterns observed in the populations from the mainland southern china and northern vietnam . however, haplogroups m <dig> and m7e had higher frequencies  in the hainan islanders than those of the populations in the mainland, whose average were less than 1%.

haplotype
comparison of the hainan islanders with other populations in the mainland
to compare the hainan islanders with other populations in the mainland , the principal components  analysis based on haplogroup frequencies  was performed . in the first pc, some sinitic populations  clustered in one pole. in the other pole, except lingao and danga, most hainan islanders were clustered with some populations from guangxi, which were distinguished from the other populations in the mainland by the second pc. the genetic difference between hainan islanders and populations from the mainland was statistically significant , whereas the difference between the li populations  and non-li populations  was not . then, we used the regression method to estimate the contribution of each haplogroup to the pcs  <cit> . the haplogroups m <dig>  m7e, m7b <dig>  m7c*, and b4b <dig> were found to contribute most to the pole consisting of hainan islanders and the populations from guangxi .

dissection of mtdna haplotypes in hainan island
to analyze mtdna variation at a finer level, we dissected the haplotype information mainly based on hvs-i segment  <dig> -  <dig> . in general, the hainan island populations showed fairly high haplotype diversities compared with taiwan aborigines or other populations from the mainland . some haplotypes were shared by the li and non-li populations within hainan island. in total of  <dig> haplotypes  observed in hainan islanders,  <dig> types could be found the identical counterparts in the mainland . in addition, the median-joining networks of the most frequent haplogroups  were unable to identify candidate founder types which were suitable to date the related peopling of hainan island .

for the rest of the three haplogroups  contributing most to the pole of hainan islanders in pca , some interesting patterns were observed. with hvs-i motifs as 16223-16234-16258t- <dig>  16189-16223- <dig> and 16166c-16172-16223- <dig>  three lineages assigned within haplogroups m <dig>  m7c* and m7e, respectively, were restricted in hainan island. meanwhile, the lineages of 16223-16234-16258t- <dig> and 16166c-16172-16223- <dig> underwent certain sub-differentiation to generate the derived lineages . moreover, haplogroups m <dig>  m7c* and m7e were more concentrated in the li populations than those in other non-li populations . hence, this implies that the three haplogroups might be useful to trace the early peopling of hainan island.

candidate markers for the early peopling of hainan island
as the available phylogeny of haplogroups m <dig>  m7e, and m7c* has not been well depicted at a fine-grained level, we sequenced  <dig> complete mtdna genomes: eleven from haplogroup m <dig>  two from haplogroup m7e and one from haplogroup m7c* . the phylogeny of haplogroup m <dig> was much improved compared to previous work  <cit> . as the result of the earliest split, haplogroup m12b was defined by mutations 11359-16129- <dig> and haplogroup m12a was determined by 318- <dig>  within haplogroup m12a, haplogroup m12a <dig> was newly determined by two sequences from vietnam as sharing mutations 463- <dig> and c insertion at  <dig>  haplogroup m12a <dig> was defined by the sequence variation motif in hvs-ii as 125-127- <dig> and then was further divided into two clades as m12a1a and m12a1b. all sequences from hainan island were clustered with the sequences from guangdong and vietnam into haplogroup m12a1a defined by transitions 15463- <dig>  the unique lineage of hainan islanders with hvs-i motif as 16223-16234-16258t- <dig> was derived directly from the root of m12a1a suggesting that the modern human colonization of hainan island was likely to be associated with the differentiation of m12a1a around  <dig> -  <dig> kya.

to characterize the phylogeographic pattern of haplogroup m <dig>  the median-joining network was constructed with all available m <dig> mtdnas . haplogroup m <dig> was widely distributed in southern china, southeast asia and the eastern part of india, but relatively concentrated in yunnan and hainan island . the network suggested haplogroup m <dig> was likely to originate from mainland southern china and southeast asia. the estimated expansion time of m12a1*, which includes the lineages from hainan island, was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya. the expansion of m12a1- <dig> lineages in hainan island was estimated as  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya. the results were largely in agreement with the results from the complete mtdna genomes . the two ages would be considered as the potential upper  and lower  limits for the peopling of hainan island represented by haplogroup m <dig>  respectively.

the phylogeny of haplogroup m7e based on complete mtdna genomes revealed that the sequence  with 16166c-16172-16223- <dig> was directly derived from the root of haplogroup m7e around  <dig>  -  <dig>  kya . as the lineages with the proto haplotypes defined by hvs-i variations 16172-16223- <dig> were mainly found in southern china and vietnam , the colonization of hainan island represented by haplogroup m7e would be probably from this region around  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya . however, as the network of haplogroup m7e was not in the ideally star-like structure, the time estimates with a huge standard error should be treated with caution. when we estimated the expansion time of m7e without the hainan data, the age  seemed more compatible with the result based on mtdna genomes .

for the sequences of m7c* with hvs-i motif as 16189-16223- <dig>  the complete mtdna sequence  could be assigned into m7c <dig> but did not cluster with any known lineages of m7c <dig>  this pattern implied that the related peopling of hainan island was likely to be traced back to the initial differentiation of haplogroup m7c <dig> as early as ~  <dig> -  <dig> kya .

discussion
in general, the mtdna haplogroup profiles of hainan islanders are similar to the profiles of the populations from mainland southern china. this pattern is consistent with the previous work on nry  <cit> . it suggests the hainan islanders should have derived from mainland southern china and/or have had a common origin with the populations from this region  <cit> . especially, most hainan islanders were clustered with some populations from guangxi . this pattern was also reflected by the genome-wide data: the jiamao population in hainan island was clustered with the zhuang population  as a branch in the tree of the "pan-asian"  <cit> . thus, the ancestors of the li populations were likely from guangxi.

as the prevailing haplotype sharing has been found between the hainan islanders and the populations from the mainland, the role of the recent gene flow from the mainland in shaping the maternal pool of hainan islanders can not be ignored. this result is in agreement with the archaeological research, which revealed that the tight links between hainan island and mainland southern china existed during the neolithic period  <cit> . meanwhile, some haplotypes were shared by the li  and the non-li  populations . it suggests that intermarriages among different populations might be common and could strengthen the effect of recent demographic events. as a result, although certain haplogroups in hainan islanders present the star-like phylogeny in the network  and the characteristics of the candidate founders  <cit> , whether their expansion time estimates  could be associated with the early peopling of hainan island is still elusive.

to trace the early peopling of hainan island, we paid more attention to haplogroups m <dig> m7c1*, and m7e, because: 1) they have relatively high frequencies in hainan island and are relatively concentrated in the li populations; 2) some lineages within these haplogroups are only found in hainan island; 3) certain sub-differentiation within these haplogroups are observed. detailed phylogeographic analyses based on mtdna genomes suggested the initial peopling of hainan island was likely to be around  <dig> -  <dig> kya  when hainan island was connected with the mainland southern china and/or northern vietnam  <cit> . the long-standing connection between hainan island and the mainland from the lgm to  <dig> -  <dig> kya  <cit>  could provide the opportunity for some of the dispersals of modern human. our results are largely in agreement with the time estimates from nry  <cit>  and are supported by the recent archeological findings  <cit> . however, as mentioned above, the gene pool of hainan islanders was likely to be affected by the recent immigrants from the mainland. to pin down the recent gene flow and the ancient components in detail, it is necessary to improve the resolution of molecular markers, together with extensive sampling, and even to employ genome-wide autosomal markers, which could be the future direction and would provide more details about the peopling of hainan island.

CONCLUSIONS
combining the fresh data of the mtdna variation of the  <dig> li individuals and those from previous study, we not only help to further understand the mtdna phylogeny in hainan island but also provide deeper insights into the peopling of hainan island. although some genetic differentiations from the populations in the mainland did emerge, in general, the mtdna phylogeny in hainan island was represented as a subset in the context of east asian and southeast asian. the ancestors of the li people were likely from the populations in mainland southern china, especially in guangxi. the recent gene flow from the mainland might play important roles in shaping the maternal pool of hainan islanders. based on the mtdna genome sequencing, the phylogeographic analyses of haplogroups m <dig>  m7e, and m7c1* suggested that the related immigration from mainland southern china and vietnam could be trace back to around  <dig> -  <dig> kya, which largely corresponds to the results from nry and archaeology.
