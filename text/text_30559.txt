BACKGROUND
one major factor limiting food production worldwide is soil water deficits. currently, 70% of the world’s total water consumption is used for agriculture. however, the 18% of agricultural land that is irrigated produces approximately 40% of the global food supply. the rest of the food supply relies on natural water resources such as floods and rain. the amount of food required by the developing world is expected to double by  <dig>  it is likely that this enormous increase in production will take place on the same or even a decreased land area, with less water available due to the effects of global climatic change  <cit> . these negative effects, however, will influence not only arid and semi-arid regions but also continental climate areas. thus, developing appropriate varieties, agricultural practices and management strategies to produce crops under drought stress will be a challenge for the 21st century.

potato  is the third most important food crop in the world, with annual production exceeding  <dig> million tons . compared to other crops, potato is considered drought sensitive, and even short periods of stress can cause significant reductions in tuber yield  <cit> . recent advances in understanding the genetic control of drought tolerance offer new opportunities to develop crops that are less damaged by low soil moisture. these advances could prevent or reduce crop losses and decrease the amount of water needed for irrigation, which is an important goal for areas with increasingly limited water supplies  <cit> .

potato drought tolerance has been addressed at the morphological, physiological and molecular levels. canopy architecture, root size, photosynthesis, and sugar accumulation-related traits are associated with drought tolerance in this species  <cit> . gene expression and metabolite profiling revealed drought tolerance candidate genes involved in cell signalling, elimination of reactive oxygen species, biosynthesis of long-chain fatty acids and waxes, enhanced production of cell-protective factors such as lea and heat shock proteins, and osmolyte accumulation  <cit> .

one way to modify plant water usage is to genetically engineer drought-tolerant strains. many organisms have evolved traits that enable them to survive in extreme environments, and the gene underlying these phenotypes could potentially be introduced into crop plants. some of these genes encode stress proteins, which are directly implicated in stress tolerance, while others encode proteins involved in the synthesis of osmolytes  <cit> . in the potato, osmotic adjustment is associated with increased concentrations of sucrose, raffinose, galactinol, pinitol, proline and polyamines  <cit> . trehalose  is one such osmolyte that can adjust osmosis and protect macromolecules  <cit> . a number of genes involved in trehalose metabolism, including the yeast trehalose-phosphate synthase  <dig>  gene, have been used to improve the drought tolerance of several different plant species  <cit> .

to obtain drought-tolerant potato plants, we previously transformed s. tuberosum cv. white lady with the yeast tps <dig> gene driven by the drought-inducible potato promoter stds <dig>  tps <dig> transgenic lines were drought-tolerant: they displayed higher stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis rates than wild-type plants under drought stress, and their detached leaves wilted more slowly than leaves of control plants  <cit> . stress-inducible promoters usually maintain a low level of expression of the regulated gene, even under non-inducing growth conditions. however, that low expression level may have negative pleiotropic effects on the plant under conditions where the product of the expressed gene is not necessary  <cit> . we have observed such negative pleiotropic effects in the case of the tps <dig> transgenic lines, which displayed stunted growth, a significant, on average 30% reduction in shoot mass and leaf area, a lower co <dig> fixation rate and reduced stomata number compared to wild-type plants under well-watered conditions  <cit> . to understand the molecular basis of this phenomenon, we compared the transcriptomes of wild-type and tps <dig> transgenic plants. we shown that  <dig> and  <dig> genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in the mature source leaves of tps <dig> transgenic plants compared to wild-type controls. we also demonstrated that the starch content was lower, while the malate, inositol and maltose levels were higher in tps <dig> transgenic than wild-type leaves  <cit> .

despite the negative effects caused by the expression of the tps <dig> gene, the transgenic lines did display drought stress tolerance  <cit> . in this study, we describe the results of genome-wide transcriptional profiling and metabolic analyses of tps <dig> transgenic and wild-type potato leaves under drought stress and define differences and similarities in gene expression and metabolite content of natural, introgressed, and transgenic drought-tolerant lines.

RESULTS
the effect of drought on the potato leaf transcriptome
to compare the leaf transcriptomes of drought-tolerant tps <dig> transgenic and drought-sensitive wild-type  potato plants, samples of each line were grown under irrigation or drought stress in a greenhouse. after two weeks of water restriction, we collected source leaves and determined the relative water content  of one composite leaf per plant to ensure that the water status of the plants was in the stage that reflects the phenotypic and physiological differences between the drought-tolerant tps <dig> transgenic and the drought-sensitive wt control plants  <cit> . the rwc values of the lines were the same under well-watered conditions , but under drought stress, the rwcs of the tps <dig> transgenic t <dig> and t <dig> lines were markedly higher  than the rwc of the control wt leaves . these values correspond to previously determined values  <cit> . rna was isolated from the rest of the leaves of each line. for microarray analysis, however, we used only the t <dig> line because this line was previously used for a microarray analysis of plants grown under well-watered conditions  <cit> .

total rna isolated from the leaves was transcribed into fluorescently labelled cdna, which was then hybridised to 60-mer oligonucleotide potato microarrays  <cit>  as previously described  <cit> . the following three comparisons were performed: wt plants under drought versus wt plants under irrigation , t <dig> plants under drought versus t <dig> plants under irrigation , and t <dig> plants under drought versus wt plants under drought . all comparisons were performed with three biological replicates and three technical replicates. normalised data from the three comparisons were subjected to statistical analysis using the “rank products” method  <cit>  with which we identified  <dig>  genes with statistically significant  changes in expression level. the very large majority  of these genes had an expression ratio larger than two-fold and the number of genes with statistically significant changes was about four-times more in the t2d-t2w than in wtd-wtw experiment .

to validate the microarray data, eight genes  were selected for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  analysis. this analysis was performed for all three comparisons with three replicates each. the expression ratios of the analysed genes showed positive correlations between the microarray and qrt-pcr analyses in all three experiments. correlation coefficient  values were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  at the p ≤  <dig>  level for the wtd-wtw, t2d-t2w, and t2d-wtd experiments, respectively, indicating the reliability of the microarray data. as only one of the tps <dig> transgenic lines, t <dig>  was used for the microarray analysis, we compared the expression of the eight selected genes between the t <dig> and t <dig> lines by qrt-pcr and found that they yielded high positive correlations in comparisons of transgenic drought-stressed versus transgenic irrigated plants .

to reduce the large number of genes  with statistically significant differences in expression level and give a biological sense to them, normalised microarray data were also analysed by a two-way anova to determine the effects of genotype  and stress . in this analysis, only the wtd-wtw and t2d-t2w comparisons were included because these had a two by two factor setup, a prerequisite for two-way anova. this analysis revealed  <dig>  genes for which expression depended on genotype, stress or their interaction at the p ≤  <dig>  level. it is worth noting that all  <dig>  genes could be found amongst the  <dig>  genes displaying statistically significant changes in expression indicating the concordance and reliability of the employed statistical analyses. moreover, all genes returned by anova had an expression ratio equal/larger than two, indicating the power of the analysis. the  <dig>  genes were subjected to functional annotation using the mapman software. of the  <dig>  genes,  <dig> were annotated into the “not assigned” bin. we note that  <dig> of the remaining  <dig>  genes were also assigned into that bin but do encode known proteins. selection the common genes between the anova- and mapman-returned gene sets yielded a total of  <dig> genes  of known function that were differentially expressed  in a manner dependent on genotype, stress or the interaction between the two factors, and we discuss these selected genes below. the drought-inducible gene stds <dig> <cit> , whose promoter was used to express the tps <dig> transgene  <cit> , was highly induced by drought, as indicated by the  <dig>  and  <dig>  log <dig> expression ratio values obtained in the t2d-t2w and wtd-wtw comparisons, respectively. stds <dig> expression was also found to be stress-dependent  in the two-way anova. nevertheless, stds <dig> did not appear among the  <dig> genes, as it was not assigned into any functional category by the mapman software.

functional categories of the differentially expressed genes
the mapman software, which we used for functional annotation, categorises potato genes into  <dig> bins. overall, the  <dig> genes were classified into  <dig> functional categories out of the possible  <dig> bins . genes in the general regulation category  were highly represented; their proportion varied between  <dig>  and 52% . according to the two-way anova results, expression of the genes in the regulation category was almost exclusively stress-dependent. in the other broad functional categories, metabolism was represented at almost uniform proportions amongst the down- and up-regulated genes in both the t2d-t2w and wtd-wtw comparisons. however, the number and proportion of lipid and secondary metabolism genes were slightly higher amongst the up-regulated genes in both comparisons relative to other types of metabolism. there was no significant difference between the t <dig> and wt lines in the relative proportions of functional categories of genes down-regulated by drought stress. in contrast, there was a marked difference in the proportions of up-regulated genes, i.e., almost twice as many genes implicated in protein synthesis, post-translational modification or degradation were found in drought-stressed wt relative to drought-stressed t <dig> plants .

comparing the drought stress response in the leaves of tps <dig> transgenic and wild-type plants
photosynthesis and cell growth are among the primary processes affected by water deficits  <cit> . in line with this general observation, genes associated with photosynthesis were down-regulated in the drought-stressed wt and t <dig> plants. the number of genes affected, however, was higher in wt than in t <dig> samples, indicating a milder effect of drought on t <dig> plants .

genes encoding starch phosphorylase, which is implicated in phosphorolytic degradation of starch, were down-regulated in drought-stressed wt and t <dig> plants. glycoside hydrolase, which cleaves glycoside bonds to release simple sugars, was also down-regulated in wt leaves. interestingly, drought stress induced the expression of two sucrose synthase isoforms, sus <dig> and sus <dig>  in both wt and t <dig> leaves . in potato plants grown under optimal conditions, sus <dig> genes are most highly expressed in stems and roots and appear to provide the vascular function of sucrose synthase, while sus <dig> genes are primarily expressed in the storage and vascular tissue of tubers and appear to facilitate the sink function  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, trehalose-6-phosphate synthases  and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases , encoded by different classes of tps and tpp genes, are differentially expressed in response to a variety of abiotic stresses  <cit> . drought may have a similar effect in potato because we found that one tps-tpp gene was up-regulated and one tpp gene was down-regulated in wt leaves, while another tps gene was down-regulated in both t <dig> and wt leaves .

the tca cycle, which is part of a metabolic pathway that generates energy by converting carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into carbon dioxide and water, may be repressed by drought stress. this conclusion is supported by the observation that drought stress had a negative effect on the expression of genes encoding malate-dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase, which are involved in the tca cycle and link glycolysis to the tca cycle, respectively. in addition to the tca cycle, glycolysis may also be repressed in wt leaves because three genes encoding enzymes involved in glycolysis were down-regulated, and only one gene was slightly up-regulated. compared to wt, drought stress had a milder effect on both the tca cycle and glycolysis in t <dig> leaves .

drought stress affected the expression of three and eight genes involved in hormone metabolism in t <dig> and wt plants, respectively; most of these genes were down-regulated. unexpectedly, most of the genes in the stress-related functional group were down-regulated in both t <dig> and wt leaves. only one heat shock protein gene showed stress-induced expression in t <dig> plants, whereas genes encoding a heat-shock protein, a pathogenesis-related protein, and a dnaj homolog protein were up-regulated by drought in wt plants .

a relatively large number  of transcription factor  genes showed altered expression in either t <dig> or in wt plants under drought stress . these tfs belong to a number of different categories, and most showed the same direction of regulation in t <dig> and wt leaves. in addition to the up-regulation of an auxin transport protein and an auxin-responsive protein, an auxin-induced tf gene was up-regulated in wt leaves, suggesting that the auxin level in leaf cells might have been increased by water depletion. the tfs up-regulated uniquely in t <dig> plants included a jumonji family protein , a rna polymerase σ70-type initiation factor , a nac transcription factor , and a homeodomain family protein belonging to the phd finger subgroup .

twenty-four genes, mainly receptor-like kinases and calcium-binding proteins with signalling functions, were down-regulated by drought in both wt and t <dig> leaves. in contrast, only four genes in the signalling category showed drought-inducible expression: two genes in t <dig>  one in wt, and a glutamate receptor gene in both lines .

metabolite changes in drought-stressed leaves
we previously showed that under well-watered conditions, the amounts of fructose, galactose, glucose, sorbitol, and sucrose were largely similar between the wt and tps <dig> transgenic lines, while the levels of inositol, maltose, and malate were higher in the tps <dig> line  <cit> . we extracted carbohydrates from the same pool of stressed leaves used for microarray analysis and found that the amounts of maltose and malate were the same as in irrigated plants . we note here that the unchanged amount of malate was surprising because it has been shown that addition of malate reduces both activity and transcript level of nitrate reductase  <cit> . since we have detected a strong down-regulation of nitrate reductase in both wt and tps1-transgenic plants under drought stress , we expected an increase in malate concentration under stress. however, the levels of fructose, galactose, and glucose were higher in the stressed relative to the well-watered wt control leaves. in contrast, drought stress either did not change or even reduced the amounts of these three compounds in the tps <dig> transgenic lines. a  <dig> -fold increase in the inositol level was detected in the drought-stressed wt leaves relative to the unstressed wt controls, while this increase was only  <dig> -fold in t <dig> and  <dig> -fold in t <dig> leaves. considering that the inositol content was  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold higher in the t <dig> and t <dig> transgenic lines relative to the wt leaves under well-watered conditions  <cit> , the actual increase in inositol level triggered by stress was only about 2-fold. very strong 11-,  <dig> -, and  <dig> -fold increases in raffinose content were observed in response to drought treatment in wt, t <dig> and t <dig> leaves, respectively. nevertheless, the concentration of raffinose was still quite low compared to other sugars, which were present in the μmol g− <dig> dry weight range, while the maximum concentration of raffinose was 50 nmol g− <dig> dry weight .

drought stress reduced the starch content of the wt leaves by about 65%. in contrast, no significant change in the otherwise lower amount of starch in tps <dig> transgenic plants under the no-stress condition  <cit>  was detected in the leaves in response to drought stress .

proline accumulates in many plant species in response to environmental stress  <cit> . this prompted us to measure the concentration of proline in wt and tps <dig> transgenic plants. proline increased by 10- to 18-fold in each line . in this respect, there is no difference in the responses of wt and tps <dig> transgenic lines to drought stress.

discussion
the microarray study described herein primarily focused on the leaf transcriptomes of the potato cultivar white lady  and the tps <dig> transgenic derivative  exposed to drought stress in the form of 30% soil moisture content. by analysing the microarray data, more than  <dig>  genes, which had statistically significant changes in their expression, were identified in the wt plants under drought versus wt plants under irrigation , t <dig> plants under drought versus t <dig> plants under irrigation , and t <dig> plants under drought versus wt plants under drought  comparisons. although the stress treatment resulted in higher water loss in the drought-sensitive wt plants relative to the drought-tolerant tps <dig> transgenic plants, many more genes showed altered expression in response to stress in t <dig> than in wt leaves .

one major challenge in microarray analysis is to give biological sense to statistically significant data. in our work, we used three approaches to achieve this. first, we analysed our data by two-way anova to identify genes whose expression depend on two factors, plant genotype  or treatment , or on the interaction of these two factors. by this analysis, we reduced the number of genes from  <dig>  to  <dig> . all genes returned by anova had an expression ratio larger than two. second, this reduced set of genes was annotated into functional categories using the mapman software. the annotation returned  <dig>  genes with known association with biochemical pathways or regulatory functions. third, we identified the common genes between the anova- and mapman-returned sets. this resulted in  <dig> genes, which fulfilled all of the following criteria:  gene expression depends on either genotype or treatment or on the interaction of the two,  they have a known function and  the expression ratio is larger than two and is statistically significant at the p ≤  <dig>  level. we consider these  <dig> genes to have biological importance in drought physiology of potato.

out of the  <dig> genes with altered expression,  <dig> were regulated in the same direction in response to drought in wt and t <dig> plants. because the relative water content  of the t <dig> plants was only reduced from 85% to 81%, it appears that the expression of these genes is particularly sensitive to water loss. an alternative explanation is that the plant senses the water content of the soil and regulates the transcription of these genes accordingly. the  <dig> commonly regulated genes included nine down-regulated and three up-regulated genes involved in photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism, including chlorophyll a-b binding proteins, fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase , and sucrose synthase . recently, evers et al.  <cit>  compared two potato clones of the andean cultivar group with different drought tolerance phenotypes. although the rwc of leaves exposed to prolonged drought stress was reduced by only 2–3%, repression of chlorophyll a–b binding proteins, fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase, and trehalose-6-phophate synthase and induction of sucrose synthase genes occurred in both andean cultivars as well.

induction of sucrose synthase  <dig>  occurred not only under stress conditions in the wt plants  but also in well-watered tps <dig> transgenic plants  <cit> . furthermore, an atp-dependent caseinolytic protease , actin  <dig> , and a v-type proton atpase gene  were up-regulated in irrigated tps <dig> transgenic plants  <cit>  and induced by stress in wt plants. there might therefore be a common signal generated by the expression of tps <dig> and drought stress that leads to the up-regulation of these four genes.

evers et al.  <cit>  reported that while biochemical changes did not clearly reflect gene expression changes in andean cultivars, galactose, inositol and galactinol contents were higher in the drought-stressed tolerant cultivar relative to the more sensitive strain. although we were also unable to directly correlate transcriptional changes with biochemical differences, we found an increase in galactose content in the sensitive wt plants and elevated inositol contents in both wt and tps <dig> transgenic plants. we also observed a 65% reduction in the starch content of wt leaves but no dramatic changes in sucrose in either line . the starch content of the tps <dig> transgenic leaves was not reduced in the drought-stressed plants but remained at the same low level as observed under well-watered conditions. we therefore speculate that a constant sucrose level may be very important for potato plants. since stress reduces the rate of photosynthesis maintenance of a constant sucrose level under drought stress conditions may require the plants to reduce starch synthesis and channel the carbohydrates to sucrose synthesis.

inositol is a versatile compound that generates diversified derivatives upon phosphorylation. these compounds have dual functions as signalling molecules as well as key metabolites under stress  <cit> . we previously found a  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold increase in the inositol level of leaves of tps <dig> transgenic plants grown under well-watered conditions. this elevation was further increased by drought to  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold higher than the well-watered wt control. in wt plants, a  <dig> -fold increase in inositol content was detected in response to drought. because the high level of inositol correlates with the low level of starch, we assume that inositol serves as a signal for the reduction of starch synthesis. besides phosphatidylinositol, inositol-derived galactinol and associated raffinose family oligosaccharides are emerging as antioxidants and putative signalling compounds  <cit> . in a comparison of the carbohydrate metabolism of a drought-tolerant advanced potato clone and a sensitive commercial variety, the tolerant clone presented an increase in galactinol and raffinose contents, especially in the leaves  <cit> . we also found a very robust increase  in raffinose content that was more pronounced in wt than tps <dig> transgenic plants. unlike inositol, the raffinose level was not elevated under well-watered conditions in the tps <dig> transgenic lines compared to wt plants . the regulatory mechanisms that underlie these increases in inositol and raffinose contents are likely quite different. while inositol synthesis is influenced by the transcriptional and/or biochemical changes triggered not only by drought but also by the expression of yeast tps <dig> in potato, raffinose synthesis is induced by water loss and is negatively correlated with leaf rwc.

drought stress induced the accumulation of proline in both wt and tps <dig> transgenic leaves. plant proline concentrations are regulated by an interplay of biosynthesis, degradation and intra- as well as intercellular transport processes. proline is synthesised from glutamate or ornithine, and the first pathway initiated by Δ1-pyrroline-carboxylate reductase  is considered to be dominant under stress conditions  <cit> . in andean potato cultivars, the increase in proline was linked to the up-regulation of p5cs and the down-regulation of proline dehydrogenase , which is involved in proline catabolism  <cit> . in our experiments, p5cs and pdh were not among the  <dig> selected genes, suggesting that other processes than transcriptional regulation might also influence the accumulation of proline in leaf cells.

we identified  <dig> genes with differential expression in t <dig> but not wt leaves. this difference in expression might be explained by the different rwcs of drought-stressed wt  and t <dig>  leaves but could also be attributed to transcriptional and metabolic changes induced by the transgene under well-watered  <cit>  as well as drought stress conditions. we found four tfs uniquely up-regulated in t <dig> leaves: two different proteins involved in chromatin modification, one involved in plastid genome transcription, and one involved in jasmonate responses. because tfs generally influence the transcription of a set of genes, it is possible that the four tfs alter the expression of several target genes and trigger a cascade of downstream signalling events.

several different sets of cis- and trans-acting factors are known to be involved in stress-responsive transcription. some are controlled by the phytohormone abscisic acid , but others are not, indicating the involvement of both aba-dependent and aba-independent regulatory systems for stress-responsive gene expression  <cit> . expression of stds <dig> is highly drought-specific and independent of aba  <cit> . in this study, induction of stds <dig> expression was detected in both wt and tps <dig> transgenic leaves. surprisingly, however, aba-responsive marker genes such as rd22erd <dig> and erd <dig> did not appear in our selected list of genes. instead, we found that abscisic aldehyde oxidase, which catalyses the last step of aba biosynthesis, and an aba-mediated dehydration-responsive protein transcript were down-regulated in both wt and t <dig> and only wt plants, respectively . together, these correlative changes suggest that the aba level after prolonged drought stress is not as high as observed in short-term responses to osmotic stress, although this has yet to be directly verified.

CONCLUSIONS
this work aimed to compare the responses of wild-type and drought-tolerant transgenic potato lines to drought conditions at the transcriptional and metabolic levels. as the result of microarray data analysis, we identified  <dig> genes in the leaf transcriptome, which belong to  <dig> functional categories, their expression depend on genotype, drought stress or the interaction between the two, and their expression ration is at least two-fold. transcription factor genes represented about 11% of these genes. the number of down-regulated genes was about 2-fold higher than the number of up-regulated genes, indicating that cells switch to an economic state in response to drought conditions. we identified  <dig> genes that were up- or down-regulated in both wt and t <dig> plants. because the water content of the drought-stressed t <dig> leaves was only slightly lower under stress than under well-watered conditions, we presume that the expression of these genes is either very sensitive to water loss or, more likely, depends on the availability of soil water. this conclusion is supported by the fact that several of these  <dig> genes responded to drought stress in the same way in our potato lines as in clones of andean potato cultivars  <cit> . fifty-seven genes, including four up-regulated tfs, showed altered expression only in tps <dig> transgenic plants. these tfs are good candidates for functional analyses aimed at understanding the regulation of the  <dig> genes that only showed differential expression in t <dig> leaves. we also identified three auxin-responsive genes that were up-regulated only in drought-stressed wt leaves, suggesting that the auxin level is increased by stress in wt but not t <dig> leaves. no aba-responsive marker genes appeared in our gene list. we therefore conclude that the aba level may not be as high after prolonged drought stress as observed upon short-term osmotic stress. finally, we found four genes that were up-regulated in irrigated tps <dig> transgenic plants  <cit>  and were induced by stress in wt plants, indicating that tps <dig> expression can generate a signal common with drought stress.

although the biochemical changes that we detected did not clearly reflect the changes in gene expression, we found three compounds, inositol, raffinose, and proline, that were highly increased by drought in both wt and tps <dig> transgenic leaves, as previously observed in other potato cultivars  <cit> . the starch content of wt leaves was strongly reduced by drought, while that of the tps <dig> transgenic leaves remained at the same low level as observed under well-watered conditions. we found that the high level of inositol correlated with the low level of starch, suggesting that inositol, which is thought to have a signalling function in the stress response  <cit> , is involved in the reduction of starch synthesis. nevertheless, this suggestion needs further experimental verification. while the inositol content of tps <dig> transgenic leaves was elevated, even in unstressed plants  <cit> , the raffinose and proline contents were only increased under drought stress. we conclude that inositol synthesis is influenced by transcriptional and/or biochemical changes triggered not only by drought but also by the expression of yeast tps <dig>  in contrast, raffinose and proline synthesis were drought-specific and induced either by leaf water loss or by sensing the low soil moisture. nevertheless, the elevated levels of raffinose and proline did not prevent the plants from wilting because drought stress induced high levels of these compounds in both the drought-tolerant tps <dig> transgenic plants and the drought-sensitive wt plants.
