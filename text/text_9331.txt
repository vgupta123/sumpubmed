BACKGROUND
in the past ten years there has been a growing interest in engineering gram-positive bacteria for biotechnological applications, including vaccine delivery.  <cit> , and in situ production of anti-infective protectants  <cit>  and microbicides  <cit> . a common approach to genetic manipulation of bacteria is based on the use of plasmid expression vectors since these recombinant molecules can be introduced into bacterial cells by a variety of genetic techniques such as natural transformation, artificial transformation, transduction, conjugative mobilization, and electroporation  <cit> . however, the major limitation of this approach is due to the fact that recombinant plasmids are often lost from the bacterial culture upon removal of antibiotic selection. certainly, this has consequences when using recombinant bacteria in vivo where their replication occurs in the absence of selection. an alternative approach is to integrate recombinant dna molecules into the bacterial chromosome since this method allows increased in vivo stability of the genetic constructs. therefore a lot of efforts have focused on the development of efficient expression systems based on chromosomal integration of expression cassettes  <cit> . naturally transformable bacteria represent a convenient model, since heterologous dna can be easily integrated into their chromosomes, whereas genetic manipulation of non-transformable bacteria is more difficult and relies mainly on electroporation and conjugative mobilization of foreign dna molecules.

we have previously described a genetic system based on conjugative transposons allowing stable integration of recombinant dna into the chromosome of transformable and non-transformable streptococci  <cit> . a series of transposon insertion vectors containing two regions of homology with tn <dig>  <cit>  have been created in order to manipulate both naturally transformable and non-transformable gram-positive bacteria carrying tn <dig>  <cit> . the aim of this work was to select a strong promoter to improve this genetic system making it suitable for expression of single-copy recombinant genes in a broad spectrum of gram-positive bacteria.

RESULTS
promoter selection by chromosomal integration
to select resident promoters from the genome of streptococcus gordonii, we performed a random ligation of streptococcal dna to a promoterless cat gene, conferring resistance to chloramphenicol . the ligation mixture was used to transform the naturally transformable s. gordonii «challis» strain v <dig> and transformants were selected for cm resistance. chromosomal dna flanking the promoterless cat gene provided the homology for the random integration of cat into the chromosome during transformation .  <dig> cm-resistant  transformants were isolated, presumably as a result of transcriptional fusions of streptococcal promoters to the promoterless cat gene. eighteen cmr transformants were selected for further characterization. the strategy commonly used to select promoters is based on cloning random chromosomal dna fragments in a promoter probe vector upstream of a promoterless reporter gene. however, integrating the promoterless reporter gene  directly into the streptococcal chromosome, allowed us to select resident chromosomal promoters expressing cat after in vivo transcriptional fusion at a single locus on the chromosome. this is preferable when looking for promoters to express heterologous genes integrated into the chromosome in a single copy.

in vivo analysis of promoter strength was determined in the eighteen selected transformants by measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration  of cm. fifteen transformants exhibited a mic of  <dig> μg/ml, whereas the remaining three transformants exhibited a mic of  <dig> μg/ml. the fifteen strains with higher mic were tested for the stability of the chloramphenicol-resistance phenotype: after  <dig> generations of growth without selection, bacterial cultures were plated on non-selective medium and at least  <dig> colonies were picked and tested for cm resistance. the stability of the resistance phenotype varied considerably among the different transformants . three strains  showed a 100% stability and were chosen for further analysis.

cloning of a promoter from s. gordonii
the structure of the integrated cat gene in gp <dig>  gp <dig> and gp <dig> was analyzed by southern blot. only gp <dig> showed to have a single cat copy integrated into the chromosome, whereas in gp <dig> and gp <dig> integration occurred at multiple sites . in order to clone the regions flanking cat integration site in gp <dig>  the chromosome of this strain was cut with taqi whose recognition sequence is absent inside the cat gene. the derivative fragments were ligated to pbluescript, and the ligation mixture was used to transform escherichia coli cells; transformants were then selected for cmr. all transformants analyzed for plasmid content showed to carry a plasmid of the same size. one of these transformants  was selected for further analysis and the transforming plasmid was named pvmb <dig>  by restriction analysis we showed that pvmb <dig> contains a  <dig>  kb taqi insert where a  <dig> base pairs  streptococcal dna fragment was cloned upstream of the cat gene. this dna fragment was stably maintained in e. coli, where it retained its promoter activity, conferring cmr to e. coli. this is of considerable interest since it is known that very often cloning streptococcal promoters in a high copy number plasmid results in the failure of that plasmid to be established  <cit> .

sequence analysis
the streptococcal dna upstream of the cat gene in pvmb <dig> was sequenced . analysis of the sequence revealed the presence of an open reading frame , preceded by a typical ribosome binding site  . a blast search with the partial sequenced genome of s. gordonii  showed that orf <dig> represents the 5'-end of a gene encoding the first  <dig> amino acids  of an uncharacterized protein conserved in bacteria and whose function is unknown. as indicated in figure  <dig>  this truncated streptococcal protein is translationally fused to the n-terminus of cat. sequence analysis also revealed that the first  <dig> bp of the cloned streptococcal fragment belong to the 3'-end of a gene encoding a putative acetyltransferase . to obtain information about the chromosomal region containing the  <dig> bp streptococcal dna fragment cloned in pvmb <dig>  we looked throughout the whole contig sequence and we found out that upstream orf <dig>  and partially overlapping with it, there is an orf encoding a dltd horthologue , a protein involved in d-alanine incorporation into lipoteichoic acid   <cit> , whereas downstream orf <dig>  there is a gene encoding a tmp <dig> transmembrane protein .

identification of the transcriptional start site
to identify the sequences responsible for the observed promoter activity, the 5'-end of the cat-specific mrna was mapped by primer extension with a specific primer. total rna was isolated from e. coli gp <dig>  and s. gordonii gp <dig>  in both strains, the position of the 5'-end of the mrna was located at the same purine residue at position  <dig> of the  <dig> bp region of streptococcal dna,  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the orf <dig> translational start site . putative - <dig> and - <dig> sequences closely resembling the consensus e. coli σ <dig> and bacillus subtilis σ <dig>  <cit>  recognition sequences ttgaca  and tataat  could be identified. the - <dig> region was ttgcaa, and the - <dig> region was tagaat. the spacing between the - <dig> and - <dig> region was  <dig> bp and was thus similar to the spacing in b. subtilis  and e. coli  promoters. moreover, a tg nucleotide pair was found  <dig> bp upstream of the - <dig> region; such a structure is typical of gram-positive bacteria promoters  <cit> . based on this information, we concluded that indeed we isolated a streptococcal promoter which was designated pp. the spacing between the 5'-end of the mrna and the - <dig> hexanucleotide was only  <dig> bp, which is unusually short. a second putative - <dig> region could be identified in the tatgat hexanucleotide , whose distance from the 5' end of the mrna is  <dig> bp. however, since this sequence is not preceded by the tg nucleotide pair typical of gram-positive promoters, and is separated from the - <dig> region only by  <dig> bp, we suppose that this - <dig> region of pp is probably not active.

insertion vectors to express heterologous proteins
we have previously developed a genetic system based on the use of streptococcus pyogenes surface fibrillar m <dig> protein, as a partner for the construction of translational fusions to deliver foreign proteins on the surface of s. gordonii  <cit> . to determine the possibility of using pp for chromosomal single copy heterologous gene expression in gram-positive bacteria, we first generated a transcriptional fusion of pp with a promoterless gene encoding the m <dig> protein  in psmb <dig>  a suicide vector capable of integrating heterologous dna into the conjugative transposon tn <dig> via homologous recombinantion  <cit> . the recombinant plasmid was named psmb <dig>  . to construct a tn <dig> insertion vector that could be used to express translational fusions between m <dig> and any heterologous proteins under the pp promoter control, a  <dig> bp avrii-hindiii fragment internal to emm <dig> in psmb <dig> was replaced by a  <dig> bp avrii-hindiii fragment of psmb <dig> containing a multiple cloning site  <cit>  . the resulting vector, named psmb <dig> , allows to create translational fusions of heterologous proteins between the first  <dig> n-terminal aa and the last  <dig> aa of the m <dig> protein, which provides sequences necessary for cell wall anchoring.

psmb <dig> was used to create two derivative vectors in which the emm <dig> gene was fused respectively with a dna sequence encoding  <dig> aa of the chicken ovalbumin  , and a dna sequence encoding  <dig> aa of the tetanus toxin fragment c   . a schematic representation of the recombinant proteins is shown in fig. 5a.

expression of recombinant proteins in gram-positive bacteria
s. gordonii, b. subtilis, and enterococcus faecalis were three gram-positive hosts used to analyze the capability of pp to direct transcription of the heterologous genes expressing m <dig>  m6/ttfc and m6/ova recombinant proteins.

expression of m <dig> in s. gordonii
psmb <dig>  bearing a transcriptional fusion of pp with emm <dig>  was introduced by natural transformation in s. gordonii gp <dig>  a strain with a single copy of tn <dig> integrated into the chromosome. one of the transformants , in which the integrative suicide vector drove the integration of the pp-emm <dig> fusion into tn <dig>  was isolated and analyzed for m <dig> protein expression. envelope fractions  prepared from equal amounts of cells grown to mid-log, early and late stationary phase, were analyzed by western-blotting with an anti-m <dig> monoclonal antibody. multiple bands could be detected in fractions of cells grown to mid-log and early stationary phase, whereas no band was detected in the fraction of cultures grown to late stationary phase . the intensity of the signal was higher during the mid-log growth phase suggesting that either pp is more active during exponential growth or that the m <dig> protein is being degraded during stationary phase. the presence of multiple reactive bands of molecular masses close to the hypothetical size of m <dig>  is probably due to the fact that coiled-coil proteins like m <dig> run at aberrant sizes on denaturing gels  <cit> .

expression of m6/ttfc in b. subtilis
competent cells of b. subtilis gp <dig> , containing one copy of tn <dig> integrated into the chromosome, were transformed with the insertion vector psmb <dig>  bearing the transcriptional fusion pp-emm6/ttfc. one transformant, gp <dig>  was chosen for further studies. a culture of gp <dig> was grown to mid-exponential phase and analyzed by western-blotting for the presence of recombinant m6/ttfc. as shown in fig. 6b, two reactive bands could be detected in the envelope fraction. the lower band, indicated by an arrow, corresponds to the mature protein , while the upper band probably represents an unprocessed form .

expression of m6/ova in e. faecalis
using a previously described genetic system  <cit> , we constructed a derivative of the e. faecalis strain og1ss  <cit>  expressing the recombinant m6/ova protein under pp control. psmb <dig>  bearing the pp-emm6/ova fusion, was first introduced in the tn <dig> containing b. subtilis gp <dig>  by natural transformation, to obtain a recombinant conjugative transposon containing the transcriptional fusion. the recombinant transposon was then transferred by conjugation into e. faecalis og1ss. transconjugants were detected at a frequency of  <dig> × 10- <dig> transconjugants/recipient. one of them  was analyzed for cell-surface expression of m6/ova by flow-cytometric analysis using an anti-ovalbumin polyclonal antibody. the presence of recombinant m6/ova on the surface of gp <dig> was clearly demonstrated by the increase of the fluorescence intensity in this strain, as compared to the parental control og1ss .

CONCLUSIONS
we have isolated and characterized a promoter from the chromosome of s. gordonii, and demonstrated that it can be used to direct expression of heterologous genes in different gram-positive bacteria when integrated in a single copy into the chromosome. this promoter, together with the genetic system based on suicide vectors able to integrate into conjugative transposons, represents a useful tool for the stable manipulation of a broad spectrum of gram-positive bacteria.
