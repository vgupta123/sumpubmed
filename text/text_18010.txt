BACKGROUND
genome comparisons based on the map position of homologous markers between different plant taxa have established that the genomes of species within families of the plant kingdom, such as solanaceae  <cit> , poaceae  <cit> , fabaceae  <cit>  and brassicaceae  <cit>  differ in a limited number of chromosomal rearrangements, meaning that extensive chromosomal regions, and even entire chromosomes, are syntenic and colinear between different species  <cit> . however, conservation of synteny is greatly reduced when comparisons are made between members of different families, as shown through the comparison of the genomes of several crop species with that of arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> .

the rosaceae encompass a large number  of diploid and polyploid species  <cit>  including important crops, such as those belonging to the genera prunus , malus , pyrus , rosa , rubus  and fragaria . their basic chromosome numbers are x =  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and all have a compact and relatively similar genome size that for diploid species ranges from ~ <dig> mbp in fragaria   <cit>  to ~ <dig> mbp in prunus   <cit> . most of the polyploid species within the family have a genome size approximately proportional to that of the diploid genomes from which they are composed, i.e. the amphidiploid apple  has a genome size of ~ <dig> mbp  <cit>  and the cultivated strawberry, an allo-octoploid , has a genome size of ~ <dig> mbp  <cit> .

comparative mapping has been performed to a limited extent in the rosaceae  <cit> . the genus prunus, from the subfamily prunoideae, was the first to be studied, due to the existence of a high density reference map  <cit> , based on a highly polymorphic interspecific  f <dig> population and constructed with markers transferable to other species within the genus . the analysis of  <dig> published maps of prunus species, each with at least  <dig> markers common to the reference map, established that the prunus genome is essentially colinear and shared by all diploid species studied so far   <cit> . comparisons between the genomes of apple and pear, which belong to the subfamily maloideae, indicate a very high level of synteny, and no major chromosomal rearrangements can be deduced from studies of common markers mapped in these genera  <cit> . no data are currently published on synteny studies between members of the subfamily rosoideae, which includes strawberry, rose and raspberry. there is however a partial comparison between the genomes of genera belonging to different sub-families: prunus  and malus . this work was done with  <dig> markers  and, where comparisons were possible, a high level of synteny was detected, as well as at least one large-scale chromosomal rearrangement  <cit> .

in this paper we have compared the genomes of prunus and fragaria. for this purpose, we have used the previously mentioned prunus reference map and the fragaria reference map  <cit> , which is based on an interspecific diploid f. vesca × f. nubicola f <dig> population. the fragaria map was constructed with mainly ssrs and markers derived from the growing information existing on expressed sequence tag  sequences of different rosaceae species, which are available through the genome database for the rosaceae  <cit> . here, we have established a framework with common markers covering both genomes and found that in spite of the conservation of large chromosomal fragments, as expected from confamilial species, many chromosomal rearrangements separate the diploid fragaria and prunus genomes, supporting their distant position within the family deduced from dna sequence data  <cit> .

RESULTS
fragaria and prunus maps
in total,  <dig> anchor markers were available for the comparison between the diploid genomes of prunus and fragaria. these were: a)  <dig> rflps from the same number of probes found polymorphic out of  <dig> single-copy probes already mapped in prunus , b)  <dig> fragaria ests obtained after selecting from  <dig> of them highly homologous to prunus mapped ests out of the  <dig> ests of the prunus transcript map ; these markers were selected by their position on the map as they fell in regions not covered with rflps or that were judged to be of interest for the genome comparison, c) eight prunus ests selected from  <dig> ests of the transcript map that did not have sequence homology with known fragaria ests , d) eight fragaria stss obtained from genes of known function previously mapped in fragaria  <cit>  , and e) two ssrs .

two mapping strategies were used in the placement of novel markers on both the t×e and fv×fn linkage maps . for  <dig> markers: all  <dig> rflps, the eight fragaria stss, five of the fragaria ests that displayed intron length polymorphisms and the two ssrs, were mapped by genotyping all individuals of the fv×fn population. the  <dig> remaining markers were mapped using the bin mapping approach where a set of six plants  permit wselective' or 'bin' mapping using the diploid strawberry mapping population  <cit> . only ten new markers were mapped in the t×e population: the eight fragaria ests were bin mapped  <cit>  and the two ssrs were mapped using the whole population.

aresults obtained in this paper

the fragaria map, constructed with mapmaker as described in the materials and methods, included  <dig> markers:  <dig> of the previous map  <cit> , and  <dig> new markers studied here in the whole population. three of the markers mapped in the map by sargent et al.  <cit> , cfvct <dig>  cfvct <dig> and uffxa03b <dig>  could not be located using the conditions set for mapping in this work. the seven expected linkage groups  were detected, and the total genetic distance covered by the fv×fn map was of  <dig>  cm with an average density of  <dig>  cm/marker and a ratio of  <dig>  mb/cm. the resulting map shows minor rearrangements in comparison to the original obtained by sargent et al.  <cit>  most of which occurred in the upper part of the fg <dig>  this map is presented in additional file 1: 'fv×fn reference map' that is included as supplementary information. the prunus map included a total of  <dig> markers, the  <dig> described in  <cit>  plus two ssrs mapped here. the map covers a distance of  <dig>  cm with an average density of  <dig>  cm/marker and a ratio of  <dig>  mb/cm.

the distribution of the  <dig> anchor markers across the seven linkage groups of the strawberry genome was relatively even , ranging from seven markers on fg <dig> and fg <dig> to sixteen markers on fg <dig>  with average marker densities ranging from  <dig>  cm/marker on fg <dig> to  <dig>  on fg <dig>  the map distance covered by these markers was  <dig>  cm, a 78% of the map constructed with all markers. only three large gaps of > <dig> cm were observed, one at the end of fg <dig> , one in the middle of fg <dig>  and the longest on the lower part of fg <dig> . the distribution of these  <dig> markers across the prunus map was similar, with a maximum of  <dig> markers on pg <dig> and a minimum of four on pg <dig> and marker densities per linkage group ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>   cm/marker. map coverage with anchor markers was of  <dig>  cm, a 78% of the complete map. longest gaps between markers were smaller in prunus, with only four exceeding  <dig> cm:  <dig>  on pg7;  <dig>  on pg <dig>   <dig>  on pg <dig> and  <dig>  on pg <dig>  all the gaps on both the fragaria and prunus maps had at least one marker bin-mapped between the extreme markers of the gap, except for those on pg <dig> and fg <dig>  suggesting that these were the longest gaps of each map.

map comparison between prunus and fragaria
the overall pattern of synteny is summarized in figure  <dig>  where it can be seen that the majority of linkage groups of either species have most markers in one or two linkage groups of the other. the simplest case is g <dig> of both species which have all markers in common, and the most complex is fg <dig> which contains markers from five different prunus linkage groups, although most of the markers on this linkage group belong to pg <dig> and pg <dig>  considering only the prunus linkage groups, five of them contain most or all markers from only one group of fragaria , and the other three of two groups .

the presence of markers from two or more linkage groups of one species in a linkage group of the other would suggest that a fission/fusion, or a translocation event has taken place between the two species since their divergence from a common ancestor. nine of these rearrangements would have taken place between the fragaria and the prunus genomes, based on our results.

colinearity of markers within syntenic regions of prunus and fragaria was only partial. the two most colinear groups fg <dig> and pg <dig> require only one inversion event to place all markers in the same order, but many more are required in other linkage groups. as shown in the materials and methods section, fg <dig> would require two inversions for the markers present on that linkage group to be in the same order as on pg <dig> and pg <dig> of prunus, fg <dig> and fg <dig>  three inversions, fg <dig> four inversions, fg <dig> six inversions and fg <dig> eight inversions. in total, at least  <dig> inversions are needed to account for the differences in the marker order of the two genomes. the estimated lower boundary of the total number of breakpoints that separate the fragaria and prunus genomes is thus  <dig> .

a scheme of the possible evolution of the fragaria and prunus genomes from a hypothetical ancestral genome of x =  <dig>  <cit>  is presented in figure  <dig>  in this scheme we have only considered the major chromosomal rearrangements, i.e. fusions/fissions and reciprocal translocations involving more than two of the markers used for the comparison. according to this scenario, the ancestral genome underwent two fusions  and a reciprocal translocation between part of the a <dig> chromosome in fg <dig> and a <dig>  which resulted in fg <dig>  to become the x =  <dig> strawberry genome. for the prunus x =  <dig> genome, the ancestral genome was submitted to three fusions, a1/a <dig> to form pg <dig>  a6/a <dig> to form pg <dig> and a8/a <dig> to form pg <dig> and two fissions, part of a <dig> in the a1/a <dig> chromosome to form pg <dig> and part of a <dig> in the a8/a <dig> chromosome to form pg <dig> 

some inferences about the evolution of certain chromosomes can be formulated based on the comparison between the two maps , the proposed evolution of both genomes from an ancestral one , and the limited information available on cytogenetics and map comparison of the rosaceae. the simplest comparison is that of fg <dig> and pg <dig>  which display remarkable levels of structural conservation, the marker order between prunus and fragaria differing by just a single inversion event. most markers of fg <dig> and pg <dig> are in common, suggesting their origin from a single ancestral chromosome , but fg <dig> includes a short fragment of pg <dig>  and pg <dig> is not completely included in fg <dig>  with a small region being located on fg <dig>  pg <dig> is a long linkage group that contains many more markers than the rest and that is likely to coincide with chromosome  <dig> of prunus  <cit> , which is clearly longer than the other chromosomes of this genus  <cit> . based on karyotype observations, such a long chromosome does not exist in malus  <cit>  or in fragaria  <cit> . the map comparison between malus and prunus  <cit>  provided additional evidence that the long prunus chromosome may be split into two in at least one of the constituent genomes of the amphidiploid malus chromosome complement. our data suggest that pg <dig> arose from the fusion of two ancestral chromosomes, a <dig> and a <dig>  which correspond to fg <dig> and fg <dig>  respectively, in strawberry. the region of pg <dig> where the fission/fusion occurred in the prunus-apple comparison  is also compatible with that of the prunus-fragaria . interestingly, most of pg <dig>  one of the prunus chromosomes with the fewest number of markers and with the smallest genetic distance, appears to be integrated into fg <dig>  with five of the six anchor markers studied being in the same order in pg <dig> and fg <dig>  this situation may be the result of the fission of a <dig> in prunus but not in fragaria.

discussion
the comparison between the maps of prunus and diploid fragaria has been performed with  <dig> common markers. most of them were mapped already in the prunus map and were added to the strawberry map here. these markers resulted in good coverage of both genomes: 78% of the total distance of the reference maps of both prunus  <cit>  and strawberry  <cit> . the average density of anchor markers was of  <dig>  cm/marker with a maximum gap of  <dig> cm  for prunus and  <dig>  cm/marker and a maximum gap of  <dig> cm  for fragaria. the total map distance of the prunus  and the fragaria  maps were similar when constructed with all markers available  <cit> . given that the genome size of prunus is approximately twice that of strawberry these results suggest that the overall recombination rate per physical unit distance for the fragaria fv×fn hybrid was higher than for the almond × peach f <dig> individual that generated the t×e f <dig> population.

for the comparison between the two genomes, we selected  <dig> rflp probes, all from prunus or malus species, which produced good hybridization and were single copy in the prunus genome. these probes were studied in strawberry with the same stringency conditions as in prunus and  <dig>  produced poor or no hybridization, suggesting that they were not present in the strawberry genome or that their sequences differed substantially from those of prunus. some of the probes that did not hybridize were located together in the same regions of the prunus genome where several probes covering short genetic distances  did not hybridize, such as the central region of pg <dig> and the upper extreme of pg <dig> . the three probes that did not hybridize in the pg <dig> region were two from a peach cdna library  and one from a genomic library of p. ferganensis . two of them  were sequenced  and had homology with known proteins. the region of pg <dig> had four markers , all of them from prunus genomic libraries. only ag <dig> was sequenced and its sequence had no homology with protein sequences. these results suggest that the corresponding regions, or at least the specific sequences tested, may be deleted in the strawberry genome. given that some of the probes are homologous to proteins that are usually present as gene families such as polygalacturonase  and defensin protein  <dig> , an alternative explanation is that they may correspond to copies of these genes with high sequence divergence from those present in strawberry.

from the  <dig> rflp probes that produced good hybridization and that were polymorphic,  <dig>  detected two loci in strawberry, whilst in prunus they were single-locus . tanksley et al.  <cit>  found that five  of the  <dig> tomato cdna probes which they mapped in pepper had a different number of copies in each species. these differences in copy number may be due to differential deletions of duplicated dna fragments existing in the ancestral genome from which prunus and fragaria originate. the presence of these duplications complicates the genome comparison because, if only one locus of the two can be mapped, as with the rflps mapped here in fragaria, in half of the cases, the position of the marker could be interpreted as the presence of a spurious genetic rearrangement.

the number of rflps mapped in t×e that were single copy, detected with rosaceae probes, segregated in the strawberry population and had a good distribution along the prunus map, was insufficient for a good coverage of the prunus genome. this was due in part to the fact that approximately half of the probes used for rflp mapping in prunus have more than one copy  <cit>  and that a substantial number of probes used in t×e  come from families other than the rosaceae  <cit> . to solve this problem, we used the available est and physical map information in prunus to find ests placed in most of the uncovered regions. we then mapped these ests by an efficient and expensive approach, resequencing, using a cheap mapping strategy, bin mapping. this allowed us to cover most gaps of the prunus genome and to reduce the maximum gap without anchor markers in this species to  <dig> cm. given the fast rate of growth of the information on the prunus transcript map, this strategy is likely to allow us a more detailed analysis of synteny in the near future.

the centromeres or heterochromatic regions around the centromeres are often where breakpoints occur, leading to chromosomal rearrangements. most inversions and translocations in the solanaceae  <cit>  and poaceae  <cit>  had their breakpoints at or near the centromere. this information may be useful to deduce the position of the centromeres of some of the prunus or fragaria chromosomes. for example, based on the position where we hypothesize that a fusion event occurred between ancestral chromosomes a <dig> and a <dig> to form pg <dig>  we may infer that the centromere is located in the central part of this chromosome . this is consistent with the metacentric nature of peach chromosome  <dig>  schubert  <cit>  proposed a model for chromosome fusion where a reciprocal translocation between an acrocentric or telocentric chromosome and another chromosome may generate a larger fused chromosome plus a small chromosome that is eventually lost. following this model, one of fg <dig>  fg <dig> or both, or their ancestral chromosomes , was probably acrocentric. other metacentric chromosomes may be those that are composed of parts  of two chromosomes of the other species; this may be the case of pg <dig>  pg <dig>  fg <dig>  fg <dig> and fg <dig> . in the case of pg <dig>  a reciprocal translocation with pg <dig> was previously reported in peach  <cit> . the breakpoint was estimated to be located in the region of 18– <dig> cm from the top of pg <dig>  which coincides with the region of junction between the fragments of fg <dig> and fg <dig>  and may correspond to centromeric regions of these three chromosomes. on the other hand, the translocation breakpoint of pg <dig>  <cit>  is located in its distal region, suggesting that it is an acrocentric chromosome.

a rate of  <dig>  structural mutations per chromosome per million years  of divergence was estimated  <cit>  from the analysis of various macrosynteny comparisons in plants. considering this rate, our estimation of a number of at least  <dig> chromosomal rearrangements between prunus and fragaria, assuming that the initial number of chromosomes of the common ancestor was x =  <dig>  allows us to estimate that the divergence of these two species dates from approximately  <dig> mya. this places these two genera as distant taxa within the rosaceae, similar to maize and sorghum in the poaceae  but closer than tomato and pepper in the solanaceae , maize and rice or wheat and rice, both with an estimated divergence time of ~ <dig> mya  <cit> .

our results indicate that there is sufficient synteny between the genomes of fragaria and prunus to allow the information on marker or gene or quantitative trait locus  position from one of these species to be used in the other. for example, the gene that determines the ability to produce runners  in strawberry  is located on fg <dig> at a position syntenic to the region of pg <dig> where the evergrowing gene  that determines continuous leaf production  <cit>  and a qtl that determines blooming time in peach are located  <cit> . the gene for seasonal vs. perpetual flowering in strawberry  maps to a region of fg <dig> , that in our comparison roughly coincides with a pg <dig> fragment where a major qtl determining blooming time in peach lies  <cit> . these comparisons are however preliminary and need to be studied in more detail, but are a first insight into other possible comparisons that may facilitate the advancement on the knowledge of the genetics of key characters of the rosaceae.

CONCLUSIONS
whilst the economical importance of peach and its relatively easy manipulation  compared to other fruit tree species have determined that many genes have been studied  <cit>  and that the position of at least  <dig> of them has been established on the prunus map  <cit> , the diploid strawberry has important advantages, i.e., a genome of a size similar to that of arabidopsis, ease of genetic transformation, and a rapid life-cycle. in addition, the plants are small, and produce a large number of seed per cross, and thus diploid strawberry may become a very efficient organism for reverse genetics and other genomics applications that may provide useful information for other rosaceous species, particularly fruit tree crops  <cit> . this will be facilitated by the information on map comparisons between these two genera that we present in this paper.
