BACKGROUND
the current strategy for prevention of annual seasonal influenza is primarily based on the trivalent inactivated vaccine, which consists of split viral envelopes with the protein hemagglutinin  as the main vaccine antigen  <cit> . although the method has been utilized for many years, vaccination remains one of the most effective approaches, not only to prevent the spread of the influenza virus but also to mitigate the severity of illness and the impact of the disease  <cit>  since the rapid spread of the swine-origin influenza a   <dig> pandemic worldwide, the rapid implementation of a vaccine has become a global priority.

a previous investigation found that vaccination with recent seasonal influenza vaccines provided little or no cross-reactive antibody protection against  <dig> pandemic influenza a  in any age groups  <cit> . the lack of cross-protective immunity between the pandemic and seasonal influenza virus strains highlighted the urgency of rapid vaccine development. the present global production capacity of trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine is about  <dig> million doses per year. with a world population of more than  <dig>  billion people and the probability that two vaccine doses should be administered in a largely naive population, it should be predicted that about  <dig> billion doses of pandemic vaccine would be needed for adequate pandemic preparedness. the yield of virus in eggs or cell cultures is another important determinant for the amount of vaccine doses that can be manufactured. in spite of the who global pandemic influenza action plan to increase the potential supply of pandemic influenza vaccine  <cit> , the production of sufficient pandemic vaccine to immunize the world’s population would significantly exceed the existing manufacturing capacities.

to effectively vaccinate the high-risk population against pandemic influenza, two challenges are to produce sufficient quantities of vaccine during a short period and to induce significant immunogenicity and cross-protective immunity after vaccine injections  <cit> . luckily, both purposes can be achieved by using adjuvant to elicit a strong and broadened immune response. although many materials have been reported having adjuvant property, alum  is the first adjuvant approved by the u.s. food and drug administration  in the influenza vaccines for human use. however, highly heterogeneous, difficult to manufacture in a consistent and reproducible manner, and a boost injection required to generate protection limited alum in influenza vaccine use  <cit> . it is also found that certain antigens do not adsorb well onto alum due to the presence of the same charge on the adjuvant and antigens  <cit> . mf <dig> is an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant, which has been formulated in vaccines licensed for human use  <cit> . although adverse effects of mf <dig> are rare, the events such fever, chills, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, headache and rash have been found after immunization of mf59-adjuvanted vaccines  <cit> . therefore, searching for new vaccine adjuvants remain an interesting topic.

paclitaxel, a member in the taxane family, was initially extracted from the bark of the pacific yew tree taxus brevifola in early 1960s and its structure was confirmed in  <dig>  <cit> . at the late 1970s, paclitaxel was discovered able to blocks mitosis and cause the death of cancer cells by binding to and stabilizing microtubules  <cit> . in  <dig>  the drug was approved for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer, and then has been successfully used in other solid tumors  <cit> . the drug has a safe record in humans for almost  <dig> years. based on the tlr <dig> agonist activity of paclitaxel at a low dose for stimulation of proinflammatory mediator release from isolated macrophages, it was previously demonstrated that paclitaxel has an adjuvant effect on the immune responses  <cit> . when co-administrated with paclitaxel, ova induced significantly higher igg, igg subclass and igm responses in association with upregulation of mrna expression of t-bet/gata- <dig> than when ova was immunized alone  <cit> .

docetaxel is another member of the taxane family. compared to paclitaxel, docetaxel is more soluble in water, and easier to manipulate in medication. docetaxel has also been found to have immunomodulatory properties. garnett et al. recently reported that intraperitoneal injection of docetaxel after subcutaneous inoculation of a recombinant poxviral vaccine significantly enhanced the immune response in a mouse model  <cit> . present study was designed to investigate if co-administration of a split inactivated influenza h1n <dig> vaccine antigen with docetaxel could enhance the immune responses by measuring serum specific antibody responses, total ige, hemagglutination inhibition titers , lymphocyte proliferation as well as mrna of cytokines and transcription factors produced by splenocytes in balb/c mice. dose-sparing effect of the influenza antigen was also evaluated when docetaxel was administered with the antigen.

RESULTS
serum vaccine-specific igg and igg isotypes
serum specific igg and the igg subclasses were measured by an indirect elisa to evaluate the adjuvant effect of docetaxel on the humoral immune responses. figure  <dig> shows that vaccine containing  <dig> ng ha  induced significantly lower vaccine-specific igg titers than  <dig> ng ha . however, the igg titer induced by  <dig> ng ha in combination with docetaxel  was  <dig> times higher than that induced by the same amount of ha  and similar to the igg titer elicited by  <dig> ng of ha . igg titers were dose-dependent on the amount of docetaxel, and reached the highest when docetaxel was at  <dig> and  <dig> μg but was not significantly increased when docetaxel increased from  <dig> μg to  <dig> μg. although igg titer in alum-adjuvanted group was significantly higher than no adjuvanted group, it was significantly lower than that in the group adjuvanted with  <dig> or  <dig> μg of docetaxel. as no od values of the sera from docetaxel-injected mice were recorded above  <dig>  × mean value of the sera from saline-injected mice , igg titer was actually undetectable in docetaxel-injected group.

hi titers
to investigate the effect of docetaxel on serum hi response, mice were immunized twice s. c. and serum hi titers were determined. figure  <dig> indicates that  <dig> ng of ha induced lower ha-specific hi titer than  <dig> ng of ha vaccine . co-administration of virus antigen  with docetaxel at the dose more than  <dig> μg induced higher hi titers than the same amount of virus antigen without adjuvant. hi titer induced by  <dig> ng ha antigen adjuvanted with  <dig> or  <dig> μg of docetaxel was similar to that induced by  <dig> ng of ha vaccine alone or  <dig> ng of ha vaccine adjuvanted with alum.

lymphocyte proliferative responses
serum total ige
cytokines mrna expression
to investigate the effect of docetaxel and alum on cytokines mrna expression, rna was isolated from mouse splenocytes  <dig> weeks after inoculation and cytokines mrna was quantified by real-time pcr . when adjuvant was added, a remarkable change in the cytokine profile was observed. alum  and docetaxel  induced different changes in the cytokines. docetaxel +  <dig> ng ha induced higher mrna expression of all cytokines than the control  , while alum +  <dig> ng ha triggered significantly higher il- <dig> and il- <dig> but not ifn-γ and il- <dig> mrna expression than the control  .

docetaxel and alum induced different patterns of t-bet and gata- <dig> mrna expression as shown in . docetaxel +  <dig> ng ha induced significantly higher both t-bet and gata- <dig> mrna expression than the control without adjuvant ; alum +  <dig> ng ha induced significantly higher gata- <dig>  than the docetaxel group but similar t-bet mrna expression to the control .

micrornas expressed by macrophages stimulated in vitro by docetaxel
when murine macrophages were incubated with docetaxel at  <dig>  μg/ml for  <dig> h, only mir-146a expression was significantly increased in comparison with the control ;  <dig> hours later, the expression of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-146a was significantly increased  while mir-181a and mir-125b had no significant changes .

discussion
adjuvant properties of docetaxel have been demonstrated for inactivated h1n <dig> influenza vaccine in a mouse model in the present study. co-administration of docetaxel with inactivated influenza virus h1n <dig> induced significantly higher serum specific igg and the isotype responses, hi titer, splenocyte proliferation in response to cona, lps and ha than when influenza vaccine was immunized alone. in addition, significantly increased mrna expressions of ifn-γ, il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> by splenocytes in association with up-regulation of mrna expression of t-bet/gata- <dig> were observed in docetaxel-adjuvanted groups. serum total ige level in the docetaxel adjuvanted group was significantly lower than the alum-adjuvanted group. mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-146a are up-regulated in raw  <dig>  cells in response to docetaxel.

the mouse model has been used to study the immunity of a host against influenza infection for long time. for example, cox et al. immunized mice with a split influenza virus vaccine, and observed that the inhibition of viral replication by immunization correlates high influenza specific serum igg concentrations  <cit> . caillet et al. immunized balb/c mice with a h1n <dig> influenza vaccine using oil-in-water emulsion af <dig> as an adjuvant, and found that the mice receiving af03-adjuvanted vaccine had antigen-specific antibody titers 3- to 10-fold higher than that in animals administered antigen alone  <cit> . the antibody response elicited by antigen is dose-dependent. caillet et al. reported that  <dig>  μg influenza vaccine antigen induced lower hi tiers than  <dig> μg antigen in mice  <cit> . similarly, we found that  <dig> ng ha antigen elicited significantly lower serum igg and hi titers or the igg isotypes than  <dig> ng ha antigen. however, supplement of docetaxel  in  <dig> ng ha antigen significantly amplified igg and hi titers, which were similar to the titers elicited by  <dig> ng ha when docetaxel was added at  <dig> or  <dig> μg as indicated in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  suggesting that the same level of the immune responses could be induced by smaller dose of antigen if docetaxel is used as an adjuvant in the production of vaccines. garnett et al. significantly enhanced the immune response to a recombinant poxviral vaccine by injection of docetaxel at  <dig> μg  <cit> . in this study, antibody titers had no long significant changes when docetaxel was increased from  <dig> to  <dig> μg per dose.

igg is the most plentiful immunoglobulin in the serum, and provides the considerable protection against most blood infectious agents. during a t-cell dependent immune response, a progressive change takes place in the principal immunoglobulin class of the specific antibodies. this subclass switch is influenced by t-cells and their cytokines. data in figure  <dig> indicated that docetaxel significantly increased the production of all igg isotypes, which may be associated with simultaneously up-regulated gene expression of t-bet and gata- <dig> , leading to increased production of ifn-γ, il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> by splenocytes . while alum enhanced only igg <dig>  but not igg2a, igg2b and igg <dig> , which may be related to up-regulated gene expression of gata- <dig>  resulting in enhanced production of th <dig> type cytokines such as il- <dig> and il- <dig> as shown in . all these suggest that docetaxel activated both th <dig> and th <dig> while alum only triggered th <dig> type immune responses.

hemagglutinin has the capacity of binding to erythrocytes resulting in agglutination, which can be visually detected and thus used as assay read-out. the binding of ha to erythrocytes is inhibited by the addition of serum containing anti-ha antibodies. thus, the concentration of anti-ha antibodies can be defined as hi titer by incubating serial dilutions of sera with ha antigen or whole virus  <cit> . in humans, hi titer of 1: <dig> or higher is normally considered protective  <cit> . figure  <dig> showed that docetaxel increased hi titers, indicating that the protection capacity against influenza infection was increased in the immunized animals.

the lymphocyte proliferative response depends on the mitogen used. cona stimulates t-cell whereas lps stimulates b cell proliferation. increased lymphocyte proliferation responses to cona and lps were found in docetaxel- and alum-adjuvanted groups , indicating that both t and b cells were activated. in order to induce antibody production, antigen-specific b lymphocytes should be triggered for clonal expansion. significantly enhanced lymphocyte responses to h1n <dig> ha antigen, paralleled the increased ha-specific igg responses in mice immunized with docetaxel- or alum-adjuvanted h1n <dig> vaccine.

unlike paclitaxel, docetaxel does not bind to tlr <dig> nor stimulate proinflammatory cytokine responses  <cit> . garnett et al. recently reported that docetaxel modulated cd4+, cd8+, cd19+, natural killer cells, and treg populations and enhanced cd8+ functions  <cit> . the adjuvant activity of docetaxel may be related to its immunomodulatory effects. micrornas  are a broad class of small non-coding rnas  with crucial roles in regulation of gene expression. previous studies have shown that mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-146a, mir-181a and mir-125b are involved in the innate immune reactions. stimulation of monocytes with lipopolysaccharide  induced the expression of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  <cit> . mir- <dig> and mir-125b were found to be up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in raw  <dig>  macrophages in response to lps. the mir- <dig> has a dynamic expression profile during lymphocyte development, being highly expressed in mature b cells and t cells but not in their progenitors, its expression is then extinguished after further differentiation of naive t cells into the th <dig> and th <dig> subsets  <cit> . mir-181a has been ascribed functions in hematopoietic differentiation and in t cell differentiation  <cit> . in this study, mir-181a, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-146a and mir-125b were analyzed to identify micrornas possibly involved in responses to docetaxel stimulation . only mir-146a showed significant increase  <dig> hour after stimulation of raw <dig>  cells with docetaxel . three hours later, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-146a expressions were enhanced , while mir-181a and mir-125b showed no significant change . increased expression of mir- <dig> and mir-146a has also been found in our previous study when raw <dig>  cells were stimulated with paclitaxel  <cit> . these suggested that stimulation manner of docetaxel may be different from that of lps.

safety should be taken into account when seeking adjuvant candidates. however, the safety of many drugs largely depends on how the drugs are used. many drugs are safe at a small dose while becoming toxic when they are administered frequently at a higher dose. compared to other potential vaccine adjuvant candidates reported in literatures, the toxicity of docetaxel is transparent as it has been clinically used for almost  <dig> years. when docetaxel was used as an antineoplastic agent, the side-effects such as short-lasting neutropenia and hypersensitive reactions were reported  <cit> . the other toxicities were hematopoietic , gastrointestinal  and neuromotor , and are either usually mild in severity or easily treated or prevented  <cit> . in our study, the suggested dose of docetaxel for adjuvant purpose was  <dig> μg/mice, which was significantly lower than that recommended for cancer treatment .

the adjuvant effect of aluminum salts on influenza vaccine has been proven previously  <cit> . however, frequent use of alum-adjuvanted vaccines could be one of the reasons for ige-mediated allergy due to activated th <dig> immune response  <cit> . in the present study, alum but not docetaxel promoted the production of ige significantly higher than that of mice immunized with ha only . the increased serum ige level may be attributed to higher th <dig>  and lower th <dig>  responses in mice injected with alum-adjuvated vaccine as indicated in figure  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, docetaxel has an adjuvant effect on a split influenza a h1n <dig> vaccine by up-regulating th <dig> and th <dig> immune responses in a mouse model. when co-administered with docetaxel,  <dig> ng of h1n <dig> virus antigen  induced similar level of igg and igg isotype responses as well as hi titers to those induced by  <dig> ng of ha. docetaxel promoted splenocyte proliferative response to h1n <dig> antigen, cona and lps, mrna expressions of cytokines  and t-bet/gata- <dig> by splenocytes. the enhanced immune responses may be associated with up-expressed micrornas  as detected in docetaxel-stimulated raw <dig>  cells. docetaxel promoted similar ige level to but alum promoted significantly higher ige level than the control. considering its unique vaccine adjuvant property as demonstrated here as well as the safe record clinically used in humans during a long period, docetaxel should be further evaluated for its use in vaccines.
