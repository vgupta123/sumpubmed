BACKGROUND
bacillus anthracis is a spore-forming bacterium that causes anthrax primarily in herbivorous animals but also affecting other mammalia including humans to a lesser extent  <cit> . the virulence factors of b. anthracis are encoded on the pxo <dig> and pxo <dig> plasmids. the pxo <dig> plasmid carries the genes paga, lef, and cya that encode the protective antigen , lethal factor , and oedema factor , respectively  <cit> . the term “protective antigen” was derived because of the protein’s ability to elicit a protective immune response against anthrax  <cit> . individually, none of these proteins are toxic, but pa combines with ef to form the oedema toxin . similarly, pa in combination with lf forms the anthrax lethal toxin   <cit> . the pxo <dig> plasmid codes for the anti-phagocytic poly-gamma-d-glutamic acid  capsule which protects the bacteria against phagocytosis, or consumption by defensive cells of the immune system. various studies have shown that without its capsule, the bacteria can be phagocytized and destroyed  <cit> . attenuated strains that lack either of the plasmids have a reduced virulence  <cit> .

the current anthrax veterinary vaccine is the attenuated b. anthracis 34 f <dig> strain which was developed in  <dig> by max sterne at onderstepoort in south africa  <cit> . sterne derived a rough variant of virulent b. anthracis by culturing the organism on serum agar in elevated co <dig> atmosphere. the attenuation of this strain was subsequently shown to be due to loss of the capsule-encoding pxo <dig> plasmid  <cit> . compared to wild type b. anthracis strains, the sterne strain is relatively avirulent but immunization of animals with the strain is able to stimulate a protective immune response. the sterne vaccine consist of 1– <dig> ×  <dig> spores per dose suspended in glycerine and is administered subcutaneously  <cit> . ivins et al.  <cit>  in his study concluded that the nontoxigenic pasteur vaccine lacking the pxo <dig> plasmid did not provide protection and that attenuated, live b. anthracis strains must produce the toxin components to enable successful immunization. presently, the sterne live spore vaccine is the most widely used strain for immunization of animals against anthrax.

the efficacy of the sterne vaccine was originally assessed by virulent challenge of vaccinated sheep, guinea pigs, cattle, horses, goats and rabbits. these trials were not comparable as the vaccine/challenge doses and strains varied in the different animal species  <cit> . furthermore, adverse reactions in goats vaccinated with the sterne vaccine was reported by sterne  <cit> . lincoln et al.  <cit>  indicated that the susceptibility of animal species to anthrax is proportional to their susceptibility to the anthrax toxin. this focused research on the development and improvement of serological tests to assess protection provided by anthrax vaccines. serological tests before the 1980s lacked sensitivity and/or specificity  <cit> . this problem was surmounted by the purification of the pa component of the anthrax toxin  <cit>  and the application of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  that was highly sensitive in detecting anti-anthrax antibodies. elisas have been widely used in the diagnosis of anthrax and the development of new anthrax vaccines  <cit> . however, little data exists on the prevalence, the level of- and the duration of anti-anthrax antibodies in vaccinated livestock. various versions and adaptations of elisas have been developed in several studies to assess the immune response following vaccination, though mostly in laboratory rodent models. evaluating immune response in vaccinates by a titre-based elisa method has been used previously in vaccine potency and immunogenicity studies in the veterinary field  <cit> . the quantitative anti-anthrax igg elisa in this study describes a method of enumerating the concentration of anti-pa specific igg present in sera of immunized goats, with the aid of an affinity-purified caprine polyclonal anti-anthrax pa <dig> igg standard. this method will be compared with the anthrax toxin neutralization assay .

the tna is a technique developed to measure the ability of antibodies in sera of immunized animals to neutralize the pa and its contribution to lt cytotoxicity for certain sensitive cell lines  <cit> . this technique is species independent and has been standardized for use with multiple species  <cit> . therefore this study involved the adaptation and optimization of the quantitative anti-anthrax igg elisa in goats and its comparison with the standard anthrax tna. it attempts to address the feasibility of the use of a quantitative anti-pa antibody elisa in evaluating the immunoglobulin kinetics in an immunized caprine model.

RESULTS
evaluation of characteristics of reference standard 4-parameter curve
data from  <dig> reference standard curves made up of  <dig>  two-fold serial dilutions from 5– <dig>  μg/ml were calculated to be a =  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; b =  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; c =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and d =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . a good %re was recorded for the nominal concentrations  with the only exception being at the lower asymptote  for the  <dig>  μg/ml concentration though well within the established acceptable range of 80% for lower limit of quantitation  <cit> . the mean correlation coefficient  of the standard curves was  <dig>   with ranges between  <dig>  and  <dig> .

precision of assay
evaluation of the intra-assay coefficient of variation showed ranges from  <dig>  -  <dig> % and  <dig>  -  <dig> % for day  <dig> and  <dig> sera respectively. average inter-assay cv was  <dig> % for day  <dig> sera and  <dig> % for day  <dig> sera collection . slightly higher cv values were observed with the day  <dig> sera compared to sera collected  <dig> days after vaccination.

five assays were done in triplicates for each serum sample.

correlation between quantitative elisa and toxin neutralization assay
we investigated the ability of the collected caprine sera to protect susceptible mouse macrophages from the deleterious effects of anthrax lethal toxin using the tna. the toxin neutralizing titres of sera from individual animals at specific time-points were compared with the corresponding igg concentration using the spearman’s rank correlation test. the scatter plot  indicates a similar correlation between the log tna and igg values at days  <dig> and  <dig> post-vaccination respectively. spearman’s rank correlation of the log-transformed igg concentrations and tna titres showed strong positive correlation . tna values for the day  <dig> sera were negligible, being below the starting dilution of  <dig> for the assay .

discussion
very little data is available on the kinetics of anthrax antibodies in vaccinated livestock and the duration of immunity. the use of immunoassays could serve as adjuncts to potency tests for the sterne and other vaccine types under development. in this study we have modified and adapted an elisa  <cit>  for the quantitation of anti-pa immunoglobulins in goats vaccinated with the sterne live spore vaccine. this study investigated the feasibility and characteristics of an igg-quantitative indirect-elisa using a standard curve. this approach has been used in the field of vaccine development albeit with different model species  <cit> . correlation between elisa-measured igg levels and tna derived neutralization titres have been shown previously in various laboratory species  <cit>  but not in a ruminant species. therefore the elisa was also compared to the tna.

pa is the most essential component of live, inactivated or protein-based anthrax vaccines  <cit>  and strains of b. anthracis without the toxin producing plasmid, pxo <dig>  have failed to confer protective immunity to animals with exception to mice  <cit> . more so, numerous studies have shown pa to be able to induce a protective response in experimental models of infection  <cit> . thus, evaluation of anti-pa antibodies in sera of immunized animals following vaccination is an important step in the evaluation of vaccine efficacy due to the essential role played by pa in anthrax pathogenesis. anti-pa antibodies have also been shown to suppress germination of spores and to enhance phagocytosis of spores by macrophages and thus preventing the establishment of infection  <cit> . seroconversion to pa specific antibodies following vaccination could be an indication of the immune status in vaccinated herbivores, as already indicated in laboratory animals  <cit> .

our study evaluated the standard curve on each elisa plate and found a high repeatability with an average r <dig> of  <dig>  . a sound standard calibration curve is essential in the development and assessment of quantitative assay characteristics such as accuracy and precision  <cit> . the key factor is the level of agreement of known standard calibrator concentrations with back-fitted concentrations with the latter read of the fitted standard curve as if they were unknown samples  <cit> . the drifting of the %re from the ideal 100% can be attributed to stronger effects of nonspecific binding at the lower asymptote as antibody concentration reduces dramatically. the same effect is seen at the upper asymptote possibly due to the near infinite antibody concentration  though not as pronounced as seen in the lower asymptote. it can also be posited that the upper and lower limits of detection of antibodies of this assay are very close to the respective asymptotes of the standard curve . although %re of the standard at both asymptotes is not optimal, this effect can be minimized by the limiting of the calibration to concentrations within the ideal 100% recovery level. crucially, the assessment of the suitability of a standard curve for any immunoassay should be done early in the assay development, as a sound calibration curve is central to the development of sound assay characteristics  <cit> . this is also very important in the further development of the assay since the quantification of antibodies in test sera is derived from the standard curve  <cit> . moreover, the inclusion of a serially diluted standard reference on every elisa plate serves as a normalization and/or internal control for the individual assays.

the od <dig> values of the assay blank wells also fell within the acceptable level for an early stage elisa . the use of skimmed milk powder instead of the conventional foetal calf serum as previously described  <cit>  improved the specificity of the elisa . non-specific binding or low background noise in an elisa system has been attributed to the use of sera as a blocking agent in elisa systems  <cit> . this phenomenon was reduced with the use of skimmed milk powder as the blocking agent of choice.

with the igg quantitiative elisa in goats more sera samples can be assessed on each elisa plate when compared to the conventional titre-based elisa where end-point titrations for each serum sample are performed in rows on the plates. good reproducibility of the data was obtained over five different assays with the cv within acceptable limits. the cv between different runs  was much lower for sera collected on day  <dig> compared to samples collected on day  <dig>  this could be due to the presence of more robust antibodies with higher antigenic affinities.

assessment of lt neutralizing antibodies by the tna in various species has been shown to correlate with survival in various laboratory animal species  <cit> . these studies evaluated anthrax pa-based vaccines in laboratory rodents like guinea pigs, rabbits and mice and found correlation between toxin neutralizing antibodies and protection  <cit> . this study is the first to quantify anti-pa immunoglobins in goats using the live sterne spore vaccine in a host animal species. it is not known if a correlation between toxin neutralizing antibodies and protection will be observed with a virulent b. anthracis challenge of the vaccinated goats. crucially, we have observed a significant positive correlation between elisa-derived igg concentrations and tna titres in goats. this is an important step in further studies exploring the correlates of protection against virulent spore challenge in goats and evaluation of test vaccines. more so, it will elucidate more on the possible role of anti-pa antibodies in goats, as little is known in this regard.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, though not exhaustive in its approach, this study indicates that a reliable igg quantitative elisa can be useful for vaccine studies in goats. the assay has the advantage of a reference standard in every plate which gives a measure of good internal control, in addition to the positive and negative controls. the feasibility of a full, long term validation of the assay seems favourable and should serve as the prelude to its use in anthrax vaccine research and production in goats.
