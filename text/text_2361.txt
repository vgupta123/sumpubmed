BACKGROUND
filarial nematodes cause a number of serious diseases in humans  and animals . filarial parasites have complex life cycles that share the following general features: arthropod vectors  ingest microfilariae  that circulate in the blood or live in the skin of definitive vertebrate hosts. ingested mf penetrate the arthropod midgut and develop over a period of  <dig> to  <dig> days to become third-stage infective larvae . filarial l <dig>  developmentally arrested in arthropod vectors, resume development after they are transferred to a permissive vertebrate host. the l <dig> is the critical life stage for infection, as it is the transitional stage between the vector and the mammalian host. molecular mechanisms associated with this transition are poorly understood; they may provide important clues for new therapies and vaccines to prevent filarial infections.

prior studies have used different methods to investigate adaptations that occur in filarial l <dig> after they enter mammalian hosts . early studies used metabolic labeling and surface labeling techniques with sds-page to detect altered protein patterns  <cit> . molecular biological approaches have included differential hybridization  <cit>  and analysis of expressed sequence tags  from cdna libraries from pre- and post-infective l <dig>  <cit> . these studies provided interesting, preliminary information regarding adaptations associated with the transition of l <dig> from arthropod to mammalian hosts.

in addition to being the infective stage for vertebrate hosts, l <dig> are also important targets of protective immunity  <cit> . a number of studies have shown that irradiated l <dig>  are more effective for inducing immunity to infection than l <dig> freshly isolated from vectors   <cit> . potential targets of such protective immunity have been identified by screening crude antigen preparations and expression libraries with sera from animals vaccinated with irradiated l3s  <cit> . we have previously used quantitative real-time pcr  analysis to identify a limited number of genes that were differentially expressed by cultured or irradiated l <dig>  <cit> . the present study builds on this prior work to more broadly describe changes in l <dig> gene expression associated with the transition from arthropod to mammalian host conditions  and effects of radiation on gene expression . while prior studies focused on ests from cdna libraries, the current study benefited from recent advances in filarial genomics  <cit>  and microarray technology to provide more complete expression profiles. we have also compared changes in filarial l <dig> gene expression associated with the vector-vertebrate transition with changes associated with the soil-vertebrate transition in ancylostoma caninum  and with dauer exit in caenorhabditis elegans.

RESULTS
general properties of the b. malayi version  <dig> array 
the oligonucleotide elements on the bmv <dig> array represent ~86% of currently annotated b. malayi gene models defined by ghedin et al  <cit> ;  <dig>  of  <dig>  b. malayi sequences correspond to  <dig>  unique annotated gene models, and the remaining  <dig>  sequences that do not match annotated gene models represent genes that have not yet been sequenced or annotated in the brugia genomic dna. the bmv2array elements included all genes in the wolbachia genome and ests from o. volvulus and w. bancrofti with little homology to known b. malayi sequences. a homology search of the  <dig>  sequences from which the oligos were derived vs. the ncbi non-redundancy  database revealed that ~69%  had significant homology to publicly available known or unknown proteins from other species  . of  <dig>  brugia sequences,  <dig>  sequences had best matches to  <dig>  unique c. elegans genes with rnai information; 37% of these genes had rnai phenotypes .

functional assignments for elements on the microarray were performed using interpro, kegg, and go analysis. the complete results are reported in supplemental materials . the top  <dig> most abundant protein domain matches in the oligoarray are presented in additional file  <dig>  based on interpro protein domain matches, 48% of the products of genes on the array mapped to one or more gene ontology terms  <cit> . these go associations are available online through the amigo viewer 

overview of differences in gene expression by l <dig> type
a complete list of elements for the array with oligonucleotide sequences and hybridization data are available online through the link: . the expression profile analysis included elements with hybridization signals above background for at least one condition in pair-wise comparisons . a total of  <dig> genes exhibited significant differential expression in pair-wise comparisons  .  <dig> of these genes  were up-regulated in l3i relative to l3c ;  <dig>  were up-regulated in l3c ;  <dig>  were l3ir-up-regulated relative to l3c  . the l3i gene set contains genes required for l <dig> survival in mosquitoes and for infection of mammalian hosts. the l3c gene set represents genes induced by culture conditions that mimic the mammalian environment, and the l3ir gene set represents genes induced by irradiation. interestingly, some genes exhibited up-regulated expression in more than one condition .

we were surprised to see that the l3i list was the largest of the three l <dig> gene sets. however, this was consistent with the finding that more ancylostoma canium l <dig>  genes had reduced transcription after serum stimulation  relative to non-serum stimulated acl <dig>   <cit> . this result suggests that the l3i is not simply a quiescent or resting stage. l3i are actively preparing for their transition into the mammalian host by expressing proteins that are needed for processes like invasion and immune evasion and proteins for survival .

as expected, irradiation repressed gene expression globally; the l3ir gene set was the smallest of the three l <dig> gene sets. of  <dig> l3ir-up-regulated genes,  <dig>  genes were also up-regulated in l3i relative to l3c . most of these genes  were expressed at higher levels in l3i than in l3ir, and only  <dig>  had higher expression in l3ir;  <dig> were expressed at similar levels in both conditions .

we previously reported partial conservation of l3i expression patterns in l3ir based on an est analysis with qrt-pcr confirmation data  <cit> . the current analysis has confirmed and extended this observation. several collagen genes and other so-called immunogenic genes , were over-expressed in l3ir relative to l3c . persistent expression of important targets of protective immunity may explain why l3ir are better inducers of anti-l <dig> immunity than l3i, which are likely to change gene expression to resemble l3c with reduced expression of these proteins shortly after infection.

the taxonomic distribution of proteins encoded by the up-regulated gene models in each condition are shown in table  <dig>  more proteins encoded by b. malayi gene models in the l3i and l3ir gene sets are nematode-specific as defined by ghedin et al  <cit>  compared to those in the l3c gene set. nematode-specific gene products are attractive candidate targets for new drugs and vaccines because they lack homology to mammalian proteins.

rnai information for c. elegans homologues of genes associated with different bml <dig> types are listed in additional file  <dig>  rnai resulted in phenotypes in 10%–14% of all c. elegans predicted genes  <cit>  and in 27% of genes with evidence of expression  <cit> . in contrast, a much higher percentage of c. elegans genes with strong homology to genes associated with different bml <dig> types had rnai phenotypes . c. elegans genes homologous to genes up-regulated in bml3c were more likely to have rnai phenotypes  than those with homologues upregulated in l3i or l3ir. this was consistent with results reported for strongyloides stercoralis  <cit> . the most common rnai phenotypes observed for c. elegans genes with homology to genes in the bml <dig> gene sets were developmental delay , embryonic lethal, and sterile .

distinct functions of known genes associated with different l <dig> gene sets
the l3c gene set had a higher percentage of novel genes  than the l3ir  and l3i  gene sets . this is consistent with results from our study of ests from bml <dig> cdna libraries  <cit>  and a recent study of transcriptional changes in acl <dig>  <cit> . these novel genes may be filaria-specific, because they have no similarity to known genes in public databases. additional work will be needed to determine the function of these genes. in the meantime, we can learn a lot from analysis of differentially expressed known genes. we grouped the most abundant up-regulated known genes in each l <dig> gene set by biological function , and this information is discussed below.

the l3i gene set contains genes associated with immune evasion, stress resistance and infectivity
several classes of known genes were highly expressed in the l3i gene set as shown in table  <dig>  immunomodulatory genes are important for invasion and establishment of infection in mammalian hosts  <cit> , and prior studies have suggested that l3i modulate the innate immune system  <cit> . microarray experiments showed that live bml <dig> induced functional alterations of epidermal langerhans cells  and diminished their ability to present antigens to t-cells. thus, l <dig> may actively suppress host immune responses to the parasite immediately after invasion  <cit> . our findings suggest a molecular basis for such immune evasion, because a number of l3i up-regulated genes encode immune-modulators. these molecules may suppress local immunity to promote parasite survival just after invasion. for example, filarial alt proteins encoded by the bm-alt gene family modulate cytokine-induced signaling in immune cells and may render incoming l <dig> more resistant to ifn-γ induced killing by macrophages, as shown in a transgenic l. mexicana system  <cit> . filarial cystatins are well-described pathogenicity factors that down-regulate t-cell proliferation and induce anti-inflammatory cytokine responses  <cit> . the cystatin protein encoded by bm-cpi- <dig> interferes with antigen presentation by inhibiting multiple cysteine protease activities including the key enzyme asparaginyl endopeptidase  <cit> . bm-spn- <dig>  a member of the b. malayi serpin family, has been reported to impair granulocyte function by inhibiting two neutrophil enzymes, cathepsin g and neutral elastase  <cit> .

the l3i gene list includes a broad spectrum of anti-oxidant and detoxification gene families such as superoxide dismutase   <cit> , thioredoxin peroxidase   <cit>  glutathione s-transferase   <cit> , and aldo/keto reductase family proteins  <cit> . since non-feeding filarial l <dig> are protected by a resistant cuticle, increased transcriptional activity of these genes may be needed for detoxifying endogenous compounds such as metabolites of fatty acids  <cit> . fatty acids appear to be an important energy source in l3i as shown below. these enzymes also protect l <dig> from reactive oxygen species  generated in energy production process   <cit> . in addition, l3i are preparing to cope with oxidative stress upon host entry. prior studies have shown that filarial larvae  are more susceptible to killing than adult worms via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in vitro. this killing is believed to depend on reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates produced by activated myeloid cells  <cit>  l <dig> must be able to resist oxidative stress to survive in mammalian hosts.

the l3i gene set also includes several proteases that may be important for invasion and molting. for example, filarial cathepsin l-like proteases  are believed to be important for larval migration and molting  <cit> . l3i express a protease , which is analogous to a matrix metalloprotease in the canine hookworm  that is highly expressed in non-activated acl <dig> and involved in skin penetration  <cit> . thus, our results support the concept that proteases involved in tissue migration are over-expressed in helminth stages that infect mammalian hosts  <cit> .

the l3i gene set also includes genes that are believed to be involved in pathogenesis, parasitism and stress resistance. for example, the highly expressed bm-val- <dig> encodes a venom allergen-like protein that is related to genes in a. caninum that encode ancylostoma secreted-proteins   <cit> . asps belong to the pathogenesis-related proteins superfamily   <cit> ; they are associated with the transition to parasitism in hookworms and highly expressed in non-activated acl <dig>  <cit> . it is interesting that the o. volvolus homologue of bm-val- <dig>  has been reported to induce anti-l <dig> immunity in an animal model  <cit> .

the l3i gene set also includes a unique small heat shock protein  of b. malayi that was represented by two ests on the array . this gene was highly expressed in l3i relative to l3c, and its over-expression was confirmed by qrt-pcr . this shsp is developmentally regulated and inducible in b. malayi  <cit> . small heat shock proteins are among the most highly expressed dauer-specific transcripts in c. elegans, and they have a demonstrated role in longevity and stress resistance  <cit> .

the last two categories of proteins highly expressed in l3i were surface or cuticular proteins and highly immunogenic proteins. genes encoding cuticular collagens accounted for 19% of l3i up-regulated known genes . their dominant presence is understandable, as the nematode cuticle protects the worms from environmental stress. cuticular collagens are also needed for the development of the next stage of the parasite  after invasion. c. elegans homologs of these genes have rnai phenotypes of developmental delay such as larval arrest , larval lethal  , and slow growth   . collagen genes are over-expressed just before molting in c. elegans  <cit> . the l3i gene set also contains a highly expressed ground-like family member   <cit>  . grl- <dig> is believed to function during the dauer-to-l <dig> molt in c. elegans  <cit> . it would be interesting to test whether this gene is also required for molting in filarial worms. the highly immunogenic proteins, such as bm-val, intermediate filament, and microfilaria surface-associated proteins may be targets of protective immunity  <cit> . filarial spx- <dig> and gln-rich protein have been used as diagnostic antigens  <cit> . these proteins have also been suggested as targets of protective immunity to brugia and ascaris  <cit> . brugia larval allergen  was differentially recognized by ige antibody from putatively immune endemic normal humans; this protein induces specific ige antibody responses in animals .

the l3ir gene set contains irradiation responsive  genes and highly immunogenic genes that are also up-regulated in l3i
the l3ir gene set includes genes involved in dna repair and cuticle regeneration after radiation. genes reported to be ir in other systems were also up-regulated in l3ir as shown in table  <dig>  these included cytidine deaminase, uridine phosphorylase, aquaporin and finger proteins  <cit> . notably, various collagen gene families were also over-represented, and these accounted for more than 30% of the total and 50% of l3ir known genes, respectively. collagen is a principle component of the nematode cuticle that is secreted by the underlying hypodermis, and collagen synthesis is often increased after radiation injury in animals  <cit> . the nematode cuticle protects the parasite from environmental insults, and it may be an important target of immune responses  <cit> . the collagen gene ovcol- <dig> of o. volvulus, a homologue of the b. malayi collagen gene bmcol- <dig>  up-regulated in l3ir, is preferentially recognized by immunoglobulin g <dig>  from putatively immune individuals  <cit> . cuticular collagens of nematodes are very different from vertebrate collagens, and they are potential targets of protective immune responses  <cit> . in addition to collagens, the l3ir gene set contains highly immunogenic secretory and membrane proteins; most of these are also present in the l3i gene set. it is interesting that these genes were more highly expressed in l3ir  than in l3c . it is possible that the enhanced immunogenicity of l3ir is partially due to their persistent high level expression of l3i proteins that are normally down-regulated shortly after l <dig> enter the mammalian host. this could prolong and enhance priming of the host immune system to critical protective antigens.

the l3c gene set contains genes that are involved in growth and molting
in contrast to l3i and l3ir, most of the known l3c up-regulated genes were involved in protein expression, reflecting increased protein synthesis during culture . genes encoding various ribosomal proteins accounted for 25% of known l3c genes . it is interesting that some of these genes have c. elegans homologues involved in molting as shown in table  <dig> <cit> . c. elegans homologues of those genes have severe embryonic lethal and developmental delay phenotypes such as sterile and larval arrest  . our data support the idea that molting requires a burst of biosynthetic activity, presumably to make components for the new cuticle and for growth  <cit> . other over-represented categories were genes involved in cell cycle and phagocytosis and genes involved in fiber growth. many of the l3c up-regulated genes are homologues of genes that are also up-regulated in activated  hookworm l <dig>  these include genes that encode heat shock proteins, tubulin, and rrna  <cit> . in addition, two oligos matched to small heat shock proteins   were up-regulated, and this is consistent with previous report  <cit> .

overview of pathways and go analysis
kegg and interpro analyses were performed to functionally classify and categorize genes up-regulated in each l <dig> type. the complete kegg pathways identified for each gene set are listed in additional file  <dig>  significant protein domain matches for each gene set  are shown in additional file  <dig>  the go associations for whole l <dig> gene set are available online through the amigo viewer . differences in pathways and go terms inferred by transcriptional expression profiling were observed among different l <dig> types. it is important to note that the rna levels do not correlate with protein level in all cases; therefore, such differences are needed to be confirmed using appropriate methods.

altered pathways and significant go terms in l3i gene set
kegg pathways that were significantly enriched in the l3i gene set are shown in table  <dig>  an overview of the main up-regulated pathways for energy metabolism in l3i is presented in figure  <dig>  developmentally arrested and non-feeding infective l <dig> were expected to have low energy production. we were surprised to see that the most enriched pathway mapped in the l3i gene set was energy metabolism ). this suggests that energy production and consumption might be high in l3i. high energy consumption might be needed in part to detoxify endogenous metabolic products or host proteins. for example, the detoxification reactions catalyzed by gsts and dehydrogenases/reductases are metabolically costly  <cit> . energy is also required for invasion as filarial l <dig> actively migrate immediately after entering the host through subcutaneous tissues en route to lymphatic vessels  <cit> . however, additional studies will be needed to test these hypotheses. the microarray data show that bml3i probably use oxidative phosphorylation and the tca cycle to produce and store energy through aerobic cellular respiration in the form of atp as shown in figure  <dig>  all of the enzymes needed for electron transport in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway are up-regulated in l3i. this explains the association of the significant go term "mitochondria" with these enzymes . this also explains high expression of enzymes to detoxify ros such as superoxide dismutase and catalase  in l3i, since complexes i and iii of the respiratory chain generate these ros  <cit> . nadh and succinate needed for atp production can be generated in the citric acid cycle . genes encoding three tca enzymes  were over-expressed by a factor of  <dig> in l3i relative to l3c. acetyl-coa, the first molecule entering the tca, is produced through fatty acid β-oxidation; acetyl-coa c-acyltransferase , the enzyme catalyzing the final step of β-oxidation, was highly expressed in l3i . this is consistent with the finding in dauer stage of c. elegans  <cit> . this suggests that the metabolism of non-feeding bml <dig> is adapted to utilize internal energy reserves, predominantly fatty acids. however, there may be the alternate methods to produce acetyl-coa in bml <dig>  for example, acetyl-coa might be produced through the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, as genes encoding two enzymes in the complex were up-regulated; acetyl-coa also could be formed by acetate and coenzyme a, as acetyl-coenzyme a synthetase  was also over-expressed in l3i. we also found up-regulation of genes encoding enzymes for pyruvate metabolism  and gluconeogenesis/glycolysis  in l3i including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  and triose-phosphate isomerase . this is also consistent with results reported for dauer larvae in c. elegans .

go analysis indicated that genes up-regulated in l3i were significantly involved in four biological processes , and associated with three molecular functions  . this is consistent with the results of the kegg analysis. bml <dig> generate metabolites and energy by oxidative phosphorylation . coordinately, genes involved in the molecular function "electron carrier activity"  are over-expressed in l3i. most of the genes involved in the molecular function "structural constituent of cuticle"  encoded collagens . interestingly, these collagens were also mapped into the biological process "phosphate transport" , and some of these genes were nematode –  or filarial-specific . c. elegans homologs of up-regulated collagens in l3i had rnai phenotypes such as embryonic lethal , developmental delay, and larval lethal   . these b. malayi collagens merit further study as potential vaccine targets.

several enzyme activities such as oxidoreductase, hydrolase, and kinases were obviously increased in l3i. these molecular functions were well related to parasite survival , parasite invasion and development , and energy production . the increased enzyme regulator activity  was mainly for enzyme inhibitor activity , especially increased activities of serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor  and a cysteine protease inhibitor . in addition, the products of  <dig> m <dig> and bmc <dig>  up-regulated in l3i, were mitochondrial atpase inhibitors  associated with down-regulation of nucleotide metabolic processes . these molecules might contribute to developmental arrest of l3i in mosquitoes through negative regulation of nucleotide metabolism. go analysis identified the mitochondrion  and extracellular region  as significant cellular localizations for l3i up-regulated genes.

altered pathways and go terms in l3ir and l3c
the same approach was followed to determine functional assignments for the l3ir and l3c gene sets. to our surprise, l3ir may rely heavily on fatty acids for energy during in vitro culture as shown in table  <dig>  two genes encoding enzymes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, namely acetyl-coa c-acyltransferase  and carnitine o-palmitoyltransferase , were over- expressed in l3ir relative to l3c . in addition, genes encoding cellular membrane proteins , a family of transmembrane channels called aquaporins , were also over-expressed in l3ir relative to l3c; these genes mapped into the "pores ion channels" kegg pathway  that facilitates glycerol uptake  <cit> . pathways involved in amino acid degradation were also significantly enriched in l3ir. the amino acids include both ketogenic  and glucogenic  amino acids. the gene encoding dihydrolipoamide branched chain transacylase  represented by two oligos elements on the array  was also over-expressed in l3ir relative to l3c . dbt is involved in the metabolism of amino acids  other than cysteine  and also involved in pathways "xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism"  and "biosynthesis of secondary metabolites" . it is unlikely that all of these pathways are altered in l3ir as a result of up-regulation of dbt. however, there are good reasons to believe that some of the pathways linked to dbt are altered in l3ir. for example, the biosynthesis of many classes of secondary metabolites in plants can be induced by stress or environmental changes  <cit> . in addition, exposure to uv radiation induces the biosynthesis of uv-absorbing compounds such as secondary metabolites  in plants  <cit> . cysteine has a crucial role in inducible, endogenous detoxication mechanisms in the body  <cit> . taken together, stress responses or ir seem to be appropriately altered in l3ir.

the statistically enriched gene ontology list for l3ir genes shared some features with the l3i list . however, most of the l3ir up-regulated genes were located in cytoplasm  in contrast to extracellular region  for l3i genes. l3ir genes had fewer significant go terms than l3i or l3c. go terms related to catalytic activity and enzyme regulatory activity were not enriched in the l3ir gene set.

the only kegg pathway mapped in the l3c gene set was "ribosome for protein translation". in contrast, l3c had a long list of go terms . however, most of the up-regulated genes were involved in biological processes of protein synthesis and growth such as translation  and cell development . coordinately, the molecular functions related to these biological events were also enriched such as "structural constituent of ribosome" , "binding activities of nucleic acid binding" , and "nucleotide binding" ). in contrast to l3i, most genes up-regulated in l3c appear to be intracellular  in various compartments such as organelle  and microtubule cytoskeleton .

additional comparisons of bml <dig> gene expression results with those reported for c. elegans and hookworm larvae
we compared gene expression data from bml <dig> with data from infective larvae of a. caninum  and l <dig> dauer larvae of c. elegans. datu et al identified  <dig> mrnas differentially transcribed between non-activated- and activated-ac l <dig> by serum  <cit> . we compared transcription profiles of the non-activated acl <dig> and mosquito derived bml <dig> . the genes coding cytochrome c oxidase, genes encoding prps family member asp, and alpha-crystallin domain containing proteins  were up-regulated in both non-activated acl <dig> and bml3i. however, genes encoding catalytic proteases such as cysteine, serine and metalloprotease were up-regulated in bml3i relative to bml3c, which contrasts with finding that these genes were up-regulated in activated acl <dig> relative to non-activated acl <dig>  in addition, the lack of similarity between activated acl <dig> and bml3c was observed in gene-by-gene comparisons. for example, prps and cysteine protease were up-regulated in activated acl <dig> but not in bml3c. also bml3i actively expressed genes involved in invasion and immune evasion, while genes that encode such prps were activation-associated in acl <dig>  the biological significance of these differences remains to be determined. however, it is important to note that acl <dig> are free living organisms while bml <dig> are parasitic in mosquitoes.

sage and microarray studies have identified gene expression profiles associated with dauer arrest and exit in c. elegans  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  genes identified as dauer exit-specific genes had been further divided into five subclasses: dauer-enriched, transient, early climbing, and late. we compared bml <dig> expression data to the dauer exit gene lists, and concordant functional classes are shown in table  <dig>  genes involved in stress resistance and lipid metabolism was up-regulated in bml3i and also in the dauer-enriched subclass. other bml3i up-regulated genes were identified in other subclasses especially the "late climbing group". of course, there were also important differences between bml3i and dauer exit gene lists. for example, the dauer-enriched gene encoding cytochrome p <dig> linked to dauer formation  <cit>  was not up-regulated in b. malayi l3i despite the presence of eight elements on the array annotated as cytochrome p <dig>  furthermore, ce-hsp- <dig>   encodes a forkhead transcription factor and is a member of the transient gene class  <cit> . daf- <dig> promotes dauer formation and functions downstream of the daf-2/insulin-like receptor signal transduction pathway that regulates dauer development and longevity. there are  <dig> ests annotated as b. malayi homologs of small heat shock  <dig>  on the array, but none was up-regulated in l3i. interestingly, the transcription patterns for these two genes are similar in acl <dig> and c. elegans dauer larvae  <cit> . this suggests that non-activated acl <dig> may be more similar to c. elegans dauer than bml <dig>  again, this may be related to the fact that both acl <dig> and c. elegans dauer are free-living nematode larvae while bml3i are parasitic in mosquitoes.

consistency with prior studies and confirmation by real-time qrt-pcr
the fact that the findings from this study are consistent with previous reports tends to validate our gene expression profiles. for example, prior studies have shown those bml3i genes such as cathepsin l-like proteases- <dig> , serine protease inhibitor- <dig> , and several bm-alt family genes are highly expressed in bml3i  <cit> . irradiation responsive genes in the bml3ir gene set such as cytidine deaminase, uridine phosphorylase and collagens are also up-regulated after irradiation in other organisms  <cit> . in addition, expression profiles were confirmed by real-time qrt-pcr for selected gene candidates as shown in additional file  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our data show that the transition of bml <dig> from the mosquito host to culture conditions that mimic the mammalian host is accompanied by important changes in gene expression associated with several biochemical pathways and functions. major differences involve genes that encode proteins with various functions such as invasion and immune evasion in l3i and growth and development in l3c. irradiation significantly altered these changes with persistent expression of many l3i genes that are normally down-regulated in culture and increased expression of irradiation response genes. these alterations in gene expression may contribute to the efficacy of l3ir vaccines. our data support the findings of prior studies that suggested that l3i enriched genes such as bm-cpi- <dig> and bm-alt- <dig> may be involved in establishment of infection and immune evasion. in addition, our analysis greatly extends the number of candidate genes involved in such roles. l3i genes encode proteins newly identified in the secretome of brugia adult worms  <cit>  such as transthyretin-like family proteins  , triose phosphate isomerase   and galectin , each of which fully warrant further investigation. many of the genes up-regulated in the different l <dig> types have c. elegans homologues with severe rnai phenotypes  and some have been previously suggested as potential drug targets   <cit> . altered pathways associated with l <dig> types provide clues regarding the molecular basis of important aspects of bml <dig> biology such as invasion and evasion , and growth and development .

filarial genomics is a work in progress. the b. malayi genome contains all of the puzzle pieces. this study represents a step in the long process of assembling these pieces to provide insight into the biology of filarial nematodes.
