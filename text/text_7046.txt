BACKGROUND
basic leucine zipper proteins  are a large family of transcription factors  in plants that contain a characteristic and highly conserved basic domain with two structural features: a basic domain responsible for sequence-specific dna binding and an adjacent heptad leucine repeat domain referred to as a leucine zipper dimerization motif  <cit> . the bzips are involved in diverse physiological processes such as seed maturation and germination, plant senescence  <cit> , photomorphogenesis and light signaling  <cit> , and also play important roles in the ability of plants to withstand adverse environmental conditions. transformed plants that overexpress bzip genes have improved tolerance to stresses of salt  <cit> , water deficits  <cit> , freezing  <cit> , methyl viologen-oxidative  <cit> , heat shock  <cit> , hypersensitivity to aba  <cit> , and pathogen infections  <cit> . in addition, the bzip gene is also found to reprogram amino acid metabolism during low energy stress  <cit> .

the bzip genes can regulate the expression of genes involved in stress tolerance. for example, a bzip gene from poncirus trifoliata can upregulate the genes involved in stress tolerance, including lea, cdpk and dreb <cit> . overexpression of a tomato bzip gene can regulate stress-related genes, such as atrd29a, atcor <dig> and the slci7-like dehydrin  <cit> . the arabidopsis bzip <dig> can form a transcriptional complex that upregulates the expression of er stress-induced genes  <cit> . the investigation of the target genes regulated by bzips on a genome scale may provide information regarding the gene expression regulation network mediated by this tf. some studies have investigated the target genes regulated by bzips, but only a few target genes were investigated, and the study of target genes regulated by bzip on a genome-wide scale is needed.

tamarix hispida willd. is a woody halophyte that can grow well in drought prone soils and salinity soil. previously, we had cloned a bzip gene  from t. hispida, and the transgenic tobacco overexpression of thbzip <dig> showed improved salt tolerance  <cit> . in the current study, we further showed that the thbzip <dig> gene is transcriptionally regulated by myc genes. thbzip <dig> specifically binds to acgt elements, including c-box, g-box and a-box, and can upregulate serial stress related genes. moreover, overexpression of thbzip <dig> led to a reduction in the cellular levels of ros, cell death and water loss rate under salt, drought and aba treatment conditions. these results suggest that thbzip <dig> plays a pivotal role in the fine-tuning aba signaling and controls ros accumulation.

RESULTS
cloning the promoter of thbzip <dig> and analysis of its activity
the cloned promoter of thbzip <dig> is  <dig>  bp in length. to analyze promoter activity of the promoter of thbzip <dig>  arabidopsis plants harboring the prothbzip1::gus transgene were analyzed using gus staining . the results showed that gus activity can be detected in all tissues of arabidopsis, including seeds, pistils, anthers and stamens, in addition to whole seedlings at different developmental stages , which indicates that it has high promoter activity in different plant tissues.

the expression of thbzip <dig> is activated by thmyc6
the cis-elements in the promoter of thbzip <dig> were predicted, and diverse cis-elements were found, such as e-box, abre, dofcorezm, mybcore and w-box . additionally there were seven e-box  motifs in this promoter , indicating that e-box motif is important for regulating the expression of thbzip <dig>  therefore, yeast one-hybrid analysis was performed to investigate the tfs that can bind to e-box motif. two myc genes  were found to bind to the e-box motif . in addition, thmyc <dig> bound more strongly to e-box than thmyc <dig>  which was used for further study. to further understand the specificity of these interactions, the e-box motif was mutated  and the interaction between the tfs and the mutated motifs were investigated using yeast one-hybrid analysis. the results showed that thmyc <dig> failed to interact with these mutated motifs , which indicates the specificity of its binding to e-box motif.

to further determine if thmyc <dig> can activate the expression of thbzip <dig> by binding to e-box motifs in the promoter, the phis <dig> vectors that contained the thbzip <dig> promoter fragments with e-box motifs ) and without e-box motif )  interacted with the pgadt <dig> constructs that harboring thmyc <dig>  the results indicated that thmyc <dig> can interact with the promoter fragment containing the e-box motifs, but failed to interact with the promoter fragment that lacked the e-box motifs .

to further confirm the interaction of thmyc <dig> with e-box, the effector construct  was co-transformed into tobacco leaves together with its corresponding reporter plasmids . histochemical staining and a gus activity assay showed that the gus gene was activated in the tobacco cells when the co-transformation of prokii-thmyc <dig> with pcam-e-box or pcam-e-boxp + were performed. however, the co-transformation of prokii-thmyc <dig> with pcam-e-boxp-, and the negative controls all failed in gus activation . these data clearly indicated that thmyc <dig> can activate gene expression through its interaction with the thbzip <dig> promoter via binding to the e-box motifs.

the expression of thbzip <dig> is induced by abiotic stresses and aba
previously, we had studied the expression of thmyc <dig>  and the results showed that it can be highly induced by salt, osmotic and aba treatments  <cit> . in the present study, real-time rt-pcr results showed that thbzip <dig> is highly induced by treatments with nacl, peg <dig>  aba, methyl viologen  or cold . these results suggested that both thmyc <dig> and thbzip <dig> respond to abiotic stresses and are involved in the aba signaling pathway.

the motif sequences recognized by thbzip1
the thbzip <dig> can bind to c-, g- and a-box sequences, but binds more strongly to c-box, followed by g-box and lastly a-box motifs . among the four mutants of acgt elements, thbzip <dig> fails to bind to the cm <dig> mutant, but is able to bind to the cm <dig>  cm <dig> and cm <dig> to some extent. furthermore, thbzip <dig> is able to bind to cm <dig> more strongly than cm <dig> and cm <dig> . to confirm these interactions, the effector construct  and reporter plasmids  were coexpressed in the tobacco leaves. consistent with the yeast one-hybrid analyses, gus staining and activity measurements both showed that thbzip <dig> can bind more strongly to c-box sequences, followed by g-box and a-box .

constitutive expression of thbzip <dig> enhances salt tolerance
nine independent t <dig> homozygous lines overexpressing thbzip <dig> were generated, and rt-pcr confirmed that the exogenous thbzip <dig> was expressed in the transgenic plants . two independent thbzip <dig> transgenic lines  were selected for further study. under normal growth conditions, there was no difference in growth between col- <dig> and transgenic plants . however, the transgenic lines showed significant improved root growth and fresh weight under drought or salt stress as compared with wild-type  plants. in addition, the thbzip <dig> transgenic plants exhibited an increase in seed germination under nacl or mannitol stress in comparison with col- <dig> plants . these results suggest that thbzip <dig> conferred an enhanced salt and drought tolerance to thbzip <dig> transformed plants.

in the absence of exogenously applied aba, the percentage of successful germinations of transgenic seeds and plant growth were similar to those of col- <dig> seeds. however, the germination of thbzip <dig> transgenic seeds was more sensitive to exogenously applied aba as compared to col- <dig> . there were no obvious differences in the above ground organs between the thbzip1-transformed plants and col- <dig>  but the root length of the thbzip <dig> transgenic plants was shorter in response to exogenously applied aba .

the target genes regulated by thbzip1
the expression profile changes between col- <dig> and thbzip <dig> overexpressed plants were compared under normal growth and salt stress conditions using agilent arabidopsis oligo microarray. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> genes were upregulated and downregulated in thbzip <dig> overexpressed plants, respectively, under normal growth condition . under salt stress conditions,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were significantly upregulated and downregulated in thbzip1-transformed plants, respectively .

twenty-four significantly differentially expressed genes  identified by microarray were randomly selected for real-time rt-pcr analyses. there were high correlation coefficients between the real-time pcr and microarray data  , which validates the reliability of the microarray results.

gene ontology  analysis was conducted of the pathways significantly  enriched in the differentially regulated genes . under salt stress conditions, the upregulated genes were significantly enriched in  <dig> subgroups, and the downregulated genes were significantly enriched in  <dig> subgroups. among these enriched subgroups, seven subgroups were enriched for both up- and down-regulated genes, such as binding, metabolic process, cellular process and response to stimulus, indicating that these pathways were highly altered in response to salt stress. the subgroup of catalytic activity pathways were only enriched by the upregulated genes under salt stress, indicating that this pathway may play a positive role in thbzip1-modulated salt stress response.

to study whether the genes can be directly regulated by thbzip <dig> via binding to the c-, g- or a-box in their promoters, we randomly selected the genes upregulated by thbzip <dig> and screened their promoter regions for searching c-, g- or a-box motifs. the results showed that all of these genes have at least one c-box, g-box or a-box and most of them have two or more c-, g- or a-box motifs in their promoter regions . this result suggested that thbzip <dig> can directly regulate the expression of genes via binding to the c-, g- or a-box motifs present in their promoters.

physiological roles mediated by of thbzip1
the cellular levels of o2- and h2o <dig>  the two prominent ros species, were compared between transgenic and col- <dig> plants by nbt and dab in situ staining, respectively. the steady state levels of both h2o <dig> and o2- were displayed as deep brown and dark blue products, respectively, and were highly reduced in leaves of thbzip <dig> transgenic plants compared with col- <dig> plants under salt, drought and aba stress conditions . consistent with dab staining, h2o <dig> content measurement also showed that there was no difference in h2o <dig> content between transgenic and col- <dig> plants under normal growth condition, but h2o <dig> content in the transgenic plants was significantly decreased compared with that in col- <dig> plants under salt and aba treatment .

the cellular level of ros in guard cells and root tips were examined using h2dcf-da fluorescence staining. ros levels in the guard cells and the root tips of the transgenic plants were notably lower than those in col- <dig> plants . these observations indicated that thbzip <dig> expression enables plants cells to decrease ros amounts to alleviate the damage caused by stress.

under salt stress conditions,  <dig> unique gst genes were highly upregulated by overexpression of thbzip <dig>  and no gsts were downregulated ; therefore, we further studied the gst activities in response to salt stress. consistent with the gene expression profiles of gsts, the transgenic and col- <dig> plants showed similar gst activities prior to stress, but the transgenic lines showed significantly higher gst activities than col- <dig> plants did under salt stress conditions . taken together, these results suggested that gst genes play important roles in thbzip <dig> mediated elimination of cellular ros generated by salt stress.

evans blue staining showed that the cell death in thbzip <dig> transgenic plants were notably reduced after salt, drought and aba treatments compared with the col- <dig> plants . the levels of cell death in root tips were examined using propidium iodide  fluorescence staining. as shown in figure 6c, under normal, aba and salt stress conditions, there were notably fewer dead cells in the transgenic plants than in col- <dig> plants. moreover, electrolyte leakage assay also showed that after salt and aba treatments electrolyte leakage in transgenic lines was significantly lower than in col- <dig> plants . this result was consistent with the results of evans blue and pi staining, which indicated that the overexpression of thbzip <dig> could protect the cells from death under stress conditions.

in addition, the water loss rate assay showed that the leaves of thbzip1-expressing transgenic plants exhibited delayed water loss rate relative to col- <dig> plant leaves under dehydration conditions , which demonstrated that the capacity to conserve water is enhanced by the expression of thbzip <dig> 

discussion
despite the fact that transformation of bzip genes leads to improved abiotic stress tolerance, the molecular mechanisms of the tolerance and sensitivity remain largely unknown and were explored here. the microarray results showed that compared under normal growth condition, the number of differentially expressed genes increased by nearly 5-fold under salt stress conditions . this indicated that the expression of this tf alone is not sufficient to activate many stress-related genes, but needs to be combined with stress signals. previous studies also supported this point; for example, a bzip protein, slareb, alone cannot activate the expression of atrd29a in arabidopsis until aba is supplemented  <cit> . also, the expression of succinate dehydrogenase 2– <dig> and lea can only be regulated by abi <dig> in arabidopsis in the presence of aba  <cit> .

modulation of ros levels is critical for the tolerance of abiotic stresses, given that ros levels can reflect the damage of cellular components and act as signaling molecules at low concentrations  <cit> . plants possess a complex antioxidant system to detoxify stress-induced ros, which includes several enzymes to scavenge ros and protect the cells against oxidative stress. the microarray results showed that compared with in col- <dig> plants, the ros scavenging genes in transgenic plants found in higher levels included gst, pod, sod, l-ascorbate peroxidase , thylakoidal ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione peroxidase . gsts are involved in plant cell stress signaling and provide protection by detoxifying endogenous plant toxins under stress conditions  <cit> . this report has demonstrated that;  constitutive expression of thbzip <dig> leads to  <dig> unique gsts that were highly upregulated under salt stress conditions, and no gsts were downregulated ; correspondingly, gst activity in transgenic plants was highly improved ;  ros levels were greatly decreased in thbzip <dig> overexpressed plants compared with col- <dig> under salt stress conditions ;  overexpression of thbzip <dig> conferred tolerance to salt stresses ;  gsts can efficiently detoxify ros induced in plants by various stress stimulus. these results combined strongly indicate that gsts play an important role in thbzip <dig> mediated ros scavenging to enhance plant tolerance. in addition, our previous studies showed that thbzip <dig> can improve the activities of pod and sod, and decreased mda levels under salt stress conditions  <cit> . these results together suggested that ros scavenging capacity is enhanced in the plants that overexpress thbzip <dig> under stress conditions. this conclusion was also further supported by the histochemical assay described here. dab and nbt staining, h2o <dig> measurement and ros detection in guard cells and root tips using h2dcf-da all clearly demonstrated that the thbzip <dig> transgenic lines accumulated remarkably less ros compared with col- <dig> under stress conditions . furthermore, evens blue and pi staining and electrolyte leakage assay all showed a decrease in cell death rates in thbzip <dig> transgenic plants under stress conditions compared with col- <dig> plants . these combined results indicate conclusively that thbzip <dig> plays a critical role in ros scavenging, which prevents the oxidative damage of cells and decreases cell death.

what deserves to be mentioned is that, although thbzip1-transformed arabidopsis plants showed improved ros scavenging and decreased membrane damage under aba treatment, still they are sensitive to aba. obviously, aba may cause damage to the plants overexpressing thbzip <dig> through other pathways rather than ros injury and membrane damage.

CONCLUSIONS
based on all the experimental data presented here, a model is proposed to explain the thbzip1-mediated salt tolerance . stress signals such as aba are generated during abiotic stresses, which activate the expression of the transcription factors including myc; then, the myc proteins bind to e-box motifs in the thbzip <dig> promoter to induce its expression. combined with the stress signals, the activated thbzip <dig> in turn binds to the a-, c- or g-box motifs in the promoters of genes to activate their expression, leading to the improvement of abiotic stress tolerance in plants. therefore, thbzip <dig> is a factor in modulating abiotic stress responses through an aba-dependent signaling pathway.
