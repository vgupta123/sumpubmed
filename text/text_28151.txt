BACKGROUND

fusarium ear rot  is a common disease of maize , which reduces grain yield and quality worldwide. the fungus fusarium verticillioides  nirenberg is the primary causal agent of fer, particularly in southern europe  <cit>  and in the united states  <cit> . this pathogen is the major producer in the grains of fumonisin mycotoxins, including fumonisin b <dig> . fumonisins were classified as probable carcinogens, because of their suspected involvement in esophageal cancer and neural tube birth defects in humans, whilst in livestock they cause equine leukoencephalomalacia, porcine pulmonary edema, poultry reduced growth and hepatic and immune disorders in cattle  <cit> . the european union established fumonisin content thresholds of  <dig>  ppb in non-processed corn, and  <dig>  ppb for corn intended for direct human consumption  <cit> , which were frequently overcome in years favorable for the pathogen. in a 3-years study , fumonisin contamination was detected in 90% of southern european corn samples, with an average level of  <dig>  ppb and a maximum level greater than  <dig>  ppb  <cit> .

agronomic practices for fumonisin content reduction are ineffective when conditions for fungal growth are optimal  <cit> . therefore, breeding for resistance to fumonisin contamination emerged as the most economic and environmentally safe strategy  <cit> , and many studies focused on the search for resistance . these studies demonstrated that genetic variation for resistance to fer and fumonisin contamination exists among inbred lines and hybrids, but there is no evidence of complete resistance to the pathogen. despite moderate phenotypic correlations , genotypic correlations between the two traits were high , confirming that selection against ear rot implies the choice of genotypes with lower fumonisin contamination  <cit> .

quantitative trait locus  mapping studies in maize indicated that fusarium resistance and fumonisin contamination are quantitative traits determined by small effect polygenes . perez-brito and colleagues  <cit>  identified  <dig> qtls for fer resistance in two f2: <dig> populations sharing the same susceptible parent, explaining in total 11–44% of the phenotypic variation, but only three qtls were consistent across populations. robertson-hoyt and coworkers  <cit>  identified higher effect qtls, explaining in total  <dig> and 47% of the phenotypic variation for fer resistance and  <dig> and 81% for fumonisin concentration in two independent segregating populations, respectively. these qtls were partially consistent across populations and mapped in similar positions for both traits  <cit> . heritability was estimated in the range  <dig> – <dig>  for fer resistance and  <dig> – <dig>  for fumonisin contamination depending on the population  <cit> . ding and colleagues  <cit>  carried out qtl mapping of fer resistance on a recombinant inbred line  population in different environments, detecting significant epistatic effects on fer and interactions between mapped loci and environments. recently, a qtl for fer resistance affecting around 18% of the phenotypic variation was discovered on chromosome  <dig> and introgressed into near isogenic lines, accounting for up to 35% of the phenotypic effect when in homozygosity  <cit> .

the complex genetic bases of these traits and the strong influence of environmental factors hinder accurate qtl localization and effect estimates, therefore reducing the efficiency of marker assisted selection   <cit> . such limitations may be overcome by increasing population size and the number of markers used, improving ear rot phenotyping protocols and integrating data from multiple environments  <cit> . in particular previous qtl mapping studies on these traits were based on maps containing few hundreds restriction fragment length polymorphisms  and single sequence repeat  markers . in recent years, single nucleotide polymorphisms  have become the preferred genotyping system for genetic studies being the cheapest and the most abundant markers in a genome  <cit> , e.g.,  <dig> snp/100 bp in maize  <cit> . with the advent of the next generation sequencing technologies, snp markers have shown their full potentiality with novel approaches combing snp discovery and genotyping. for example, elshire and coworkers  <cit>  have developed a simple technique, called genotyping-by-sequencing , in which multiplexed libraries based on the reduction of genome complexity through restriction with enzymes are constructed to preferentially target sequences in low copy genomic regions, minimizing reads in repetitive regions that are frequent in maize  <cit> . gbs has been applied for population studies, germplasm characterization, breeding and trait mapping in a number of plant species, including maize, barley, wheat, soybean, switchgrass and rice . two recent genome-wide association studies were performed in maize to detect allele variants associated with increased resistance to fer, resulting in three snps with significant effects on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  and seven snps on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> .

the aim of this work was the mapping of qtls and identification of candidate genes for fer resistance and reduced fb <dig> contamination in a f2: <dig> progeny, derived from the cross between a resistant  and a susceptible  commercial maize line previously used for molecular characterization of response to fusarium . phenotypic evaluation in two different sowing times for two consecutive years was carried out in order to take into account the variation due to environmental effects. among the multitude of published inoculation methods, the toothpick  and the side-needle techniques  were chosen to phenotype the population, since the former is known for its greater aggressiveness and the latter mimics natural infection  <cit> . snps, derived by gbs, and ssr markers were used to build a linkage map as a basis for detection of qtls for fer and fb <dig> contamination in maize. finally, candidate genes for resistance to the pathogen are proposed based on integration of qtl analysis results with transcriptomic data, previously obtained on the two parents artificially inoculated with f. verticillioides  <cit> .

RESULTS
disease development and weather conditions during flowering and post-inoculation periods
the f2: <dig> population  was phenotyped in  <dig> and  <dig> and in an early  and late  sowing date for each phenotyping year.

weather conditions during two periods of maize development, flowering and kernel drying, are critical for fumonisin contamination of the kernels  <cit> . the weekly means of maximum and minimum temperatures, maximum and minimum relative humidity and rainfall occurring in the experimental field in  <dig> and  <dig> from flowering until harvest are reported in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

the temperatures and relative humidity differed significantly in the period between flowering and harvest of  <dig> and  <dig>  according to kruskal-wallis test . in particular, during the flowering period, significantly higher temperatures occurred in 2012a and b, with median values of maximum temperature of  <dig>  and  <dig>  °c, respectively, in comparison to 2011a  and 2011b . moreover, maximum relative humidity was significantly lower in  <dig>  with median values of 75% , 72% , 81%  and 88% . no significant changes in minimum relative humidity and rainfall were found between the four sowing times.

in the post-inoculation period, relative humidity was significantly lower in  <dig>  with the maximum and minimum values of  <dig> and 31% , of  <dig> and 31% , of  <dig> and 36%  and of  <dig> and 36% , respectively. maximum temperatures were significantly higher in  <dig>  with median values higher than 32 °c, whilst in  <dig> they were lower than 30 °c. the minimum temperatures and rainfall did not significantly differ in the four sowing times.

the higher temperatures and the lower humidity of  <dig> affected disease development, since the population mean in  <dig> ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for fer severity and from  <dig> to 60 ppm for fb <dig> contamination, and higher mean values were reached in  <dig> for both traits .

phenotypic analysis for fer severity and fb <dig> contamination
the co <dig> and co <dig> parents and the 188 f <dig> progenies were visually scored for fer severity and the phenotypic variation between parents is shown in fig.  <dig>  ears infected with either the toothpick  or the side-needle  method in early  and late sowing  of  <dig> and  <dig> were then pooled and fb <dig> content was estimated by near-infrared spectroscopy .fig.  <dig> phenotypic variation in fusarium ear rot severity at harvest among the parental lines in artificially inoculated ears with f. verticillioides. the resistant co <dig> is represented by the two ears on the left  and the susceptible co <dig> by the two ears on the right 




the distributions of fer and fb <dig> traits in the f <dig> population are shown in fig.  <dig>  the shapiro-wilk test showed that none of the traits were normally distributed  and they exhibited positive skewness with a leptokurtic pattern in most cases . positive skewness for fer scores was due to the high frequencies of 3rd and 4th classes , and the high frequency of low-contaminated samples  for fb <dig> contamination. transgressive segregation was observed for both fer and fb <dig> in both years of analysis and sowing times : several families showed higher and lower levels of fer severity and fb <dig> contamination compared to the parents and some were consistent across years, inoculation methods and sowing times .fig.  <dig> distributions of f <dig> progenies for fusarium ear rot severity  and fumonisin b <dig> contamination  in early  and late  sowings in  <dig> and  <dig> with the side-needle  and toothpick  inoculation methods and normal distribution curve. the classes related to co <dig> and co <dig> parent values are indicated with r  and s , respectively. x-axis for fer severity represents the 1– <dig> classes of infection of the ear. x-axis for fb <dig> contamination represents the mycotoxin content measured by nir spectroscopy and expressed in ppm




a summary of fer scores and fb <dig> contents observed in the 2 years for f <dig> families and parents is shown in additional file 2: table s <dig>  the co <dig> parent showed in all conditions lower disease severity and fumonisin content  compared to the co <dig> parent . the mean of the two traits in the population was always located between the values of the two parents, except for fb <dig> t in  <dig> a and b. friedman test revealed significant  differences among groups determined by the inoculation technique, sowing time and year for both fer and fb <dig> traits . in particular, the medians for fer of the population inoculated with the toothpick appeared significantly  lower compared to the side-needle method, according to wilkoxon signed-rank test with bonferroni correction. no significant differences in the fer mean-ranks were detected in 2011a, 2011b and 2012a, whilst the highest infection levels were associated to 2012b. in contrast, wilkoxon signed-rank test results for fb <dig> contamination indicated that the two different inoculation techniques did not significantly affect fumonisin content in  <dig>  but in  <dig> the side-needle inoculation produced a lower level of contamination in both sowing times. in agreement with results for fer, 2012b samples showed significantly higher contamination .

pearson’s correlation coefficients between phenotypic traits, inoculation methods, sowing dates and years are shown in table  <dig>  regarding the relations between traits within the same sowing date and same inoculation method, significant positive correlations  were detected between fer and fb <dig> contamination, ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>   . the correlation between the inoculation techniques , within the same sowing time, was more consistent for fer  than for fb <dig> contamination  . correlations in different sowing times, within the same year, were low  . in addition, correlation between different years appeared low , indicating a seasonal influence on the outcome of fusarium infection .table  <dig> pearson’s correlation coefficients between fusarium ear rot severity  and fumonisin b <dig> concentration  of f <dig> families, measured with two inoculation methods , in early  and late  sowings of  <dig> and  <dig>  i. correlation between traits within the same sowing time. ii. correlation between traits across different sowing times and different years

** = significant at p <  <dig> 




beside fb <dig> content and fer severity, days from sowing to silking  were registered for each f <dig> family, in order to evaluate the possible correlation between resistance to fusarium inoculation and earliness in flowering. dts showed non-normal distributions  in 2011b, 2012a and 2012b, exhibiting positive skewness with a leptokurtic pattern . values ranged from  <dig> to 78 days in 2011a, 59– <dig> days in 2011b, 61– <dig> days in 2012a and 54– <dig> days in 2012b . the presence of transgressive segregants was recorded only in 2011a. a statistically significant difference in dts depending on the year and sowing date was detected , with the highest value associated to 2011a  and the lowest with 2012b  .

the correlation between dts and fer and fb <dig> accumulation traits were evaluated by pearson’s correlation coefficients . significant  low positive correlations  were found between dts and fb <dig> contamination for all sowing dates, except for 2011a. low positive correlations  between dts and fer were detected only in 2011b , r =  <dig> .

in conclusion, phenotypic data from the two inoculation methods in four different environments showed ample segregation for fer severity and fb <dig> content in the co441xco <dig> population, providing an ideal basis for genetic dissection of the resistance traits.

genotyping, linkage map construction and qtl analyses
screening of  <dig> ssr markers on the parents co <dig> and co <dig> resulted in identification of a set of  <dig> polymorphic markers, i.e., only  <dig> % of screened ssrs were suitable for linkage analyses . to improve map density and qtl resolution, gbs was applied, providing on average  <dig> , <dig> reads per sample,  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads for the co <dig> and co <dig> parents, respectively. variant calling against the reference b <dig> genome yielded  <dig>  sequence variants, including  <dig>  snps and  <dig> indels, while the remaining  <dig>  variations fell in the complex or multi nucleotide polymorphism  allelic variant type. stringent selection criteria were used to select markers for final map construction taking into account the fact that genotyping data were obtained on two different generations . this resulted in exclusion of a high proportion of markers. during map construction, a number of markers were excluded manually based on careful inspection of their map positions and comparison with the reference genome. finally,  <dig>  markers were included in the final linkage map covering  <dig>  cm with an average density of  <dig>  cm/marker .

qtl analyses were performed using phenotypic data  recorded over 2 years  and two sowing times  with two inoculation methods . in addition, dts was subjected to qtl analyses in order to exclude loci influencing flowering time and consider only loci related to resistance. the lod value thresholds obtained by permutation test varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for all considered traits , but we considered as “stable” also qtls with lod values close to the threshold , if mapping to the same position of another qtl determined in another year/sowing time/inoculation technique, or for another trait.

while the traits phenotyped in our work are directly related to disease impact and thus to susceptibility, the goal in breeding is to improve resistance to the pathogen. for this reason throughout the paper we will consider as beneficial those alleles that decrease fer severity and fb <dig> contamination. significant associations were mapped for fer, fb <dig> and dts traits in the four environments and the two inoculation methods. fifteen,  <dig> and nine associations with overlapping confidence intervals  in at least two inoculation methods and/or two sowing times and/or 2 years, were detected for fer, fb <dig> contamination and dts, respectively . overlapping qtls in the 2-lod intervals were referred as “integrated qtls” and indicated by the trait code followed by the lg in which the qtl was mapped and a decimal if another qtl for the same trait was mapped in the same lg. between the 2-lod overlapping qtls for each trait, the highest lod peak value and the maximum explained phenotypic variation  were chosen as putative value of the integrated qtl and reported in table  <dig>  the new confidence interval of the integrated qtls were calculated on the extremes of the 2- and 1-lod interval of each overlapping qtl detected .table  <dig> mapped integrated qtls for fusarium ear rot , fumonisin b <dig>  contamination and days to silking  by multiple qtl mapping in a f2: <dig> population  artificially infected with side-needle  and toothpick  inoculation methods in early  and late sowing  of  <dig> and  <dig>  detected in more than 1 year/sowing/inoculation technique. co-mapping qtls for fer, fb <dig> contamination and dts are in bold

no integrated qtl was found in the lg  <dig>  dts qtls were mapped on the lgs  <dig>   <dig>  5– <dig>  fer qtls were associated to the largest number of lgs, being located on all lgs excluding lg  <dig>  whilst fb <dig> contamination qtls mapped on lgs 1– <dig>  with the only exception of lg  <dig>  eight integrated qtls were in common between fer and fb <dig> contamination traits, positioned on the lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . moreover, the qfer- <dig> and qfb1- <dig>  integrated qtls co-mapped with a qtl for dts  .

the average value of the phenotypic variation explained by each of the integrated qtls, considering the maximum r <dig> value, was the highest for fer , followed by dts  and fb <dig> contamination .

qtls for fer, fb <dig> contamination and dts
among the qtls for fer,  <dig> were detected in both  <dig> and  <dig> and only four in either year: qfer- <dig>  qfer- <dig>  qfer- <dig> and qfer- <dig>  . the phenotypic variation explained by qtls  ranged between  <dig> %  and  <dig> % . the highest percentage of variation was explained by qfer- <dig> , which was detected in 2011b_f and _t and 2012a_t. the resistant parent co <dig> carried the beneficial alleles  in the cases of fer qtls on lg  <dig>  qfer- <dig>  qfer- <dig> and qfer- <dig>  while the susceptible parent co <dig> contributed favorable alleles for qfer- <dig>  qfer- <dig>  qfer- <dig>  qfer- <dig>  qfer- <dig> and qfer- <dig> - qfer- <dig>  . the beneficial alleles were partially dominant over the susceptibility alleles in qfer- <dig>  and qfer- <dig> , qfer- <dig>  qfer- <dig>  qfer- <dig>  qfer- <dig>  and qfer- <dig>  and were completely dominant in qfer- <dig> .

most of qtls for fb <dig> contamination were detected in both sowings of  <dig>  and only four qtls  were stable across years . the minimum r <dig> value was associated to qfb1- <dig>   and the maximum value to qfb1- <dig> . most of the qtls for fb <dig> contamination derived from the susceptible parent , with a partial dominant effect of the beneficial alleles  in qfb1- <dig> , qfb1- <dig> , qfb1- <dig>  qfb1- <dig> , qfb1- <dig> , qfb1- <dig>  and qfb1- <dig> . the resistant parent contribution  revealed a partial dominant effect of the beneficial alleles in all cases .

all nine integrated qtls for dts were stable across years, although only qdts- <dig> and qdts- <dig> were stable also across sowing times. the lowest r <dig> value was associated to qdts- <dig>  and the highest to qdts- <dig> . only two dts qtls derived from the susceptible parent , showing partial dominance of the favorable alleles. the resistant parent contributed to the qtl for earliness in dts in the other seven cases, with effect of partial dominance in qdts- <dig> , qdts- <dig> and qdts- <dig> .

qtls in common to fer and fb1
according to the 2-lod confidence intervals, eight qtls for fer and fb <dig> contamination mapped in similar positions of the maize genome and were located on lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  most of these overlapped regions explained the highest percentage of phenotypic variation. this is the case of qfer- <dig> and qfb1- <dig>  , qfer- <dig> and q-fb1- <dig>  , qfer- <dig>  which co-mapped with both qfb1- <dig>   and qfb1- <dig>  . the qfer- <dig>  qfb1- <dig>  and qfb1- <dig>  qtls showed great stability across years, sowing time and inoculation technique, since they were not detected only in 2011b_f and 2012b_f  slightly below the significance threshold). in this case the beneficial partially dominant alleles of qfer- <dig> and qfb1- <dig> - <dig>  qtls were carried by the susceptible parent .

the qfer- <dig> qtl  was detected in both sowings of  <dig> and co-mapped with the qfb1- <dig> qtl , determined in both sowings of  <dig> and in 2011a_f with a lod  lower than the significant threshold set by the permutation test . interestingly, different regions of lg  <dig> showed associations for both fer and fb <dig> contamination, although with smaller percentage of explained phenotypic variation : qfer- <dig>  co-mapped with qfb1- <dig> , qfer- <dig>  with qfb1- <dig>  and qfer- <dig>  with qfb1- <dig> .

the qfer- <dig>  and qfb1- <dig> qtls, associated to the ssr bnlg <dig>  explained the  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the fer and fb <dig> phenotypic variation, respectively. although qfb1- <dig> was detected only in  <dig>  qfer- <dig>  was stable across years. interestingly, the additive and dominance effects associated to both qtls revealed that the resistant parent contributed to resistance carrying a partially dominant allele .

candidate genes for fer resistance
in order to identify candidate genes for fusarium resistance traits, we considered the 1-lod confidence intervals of the integrated qtls in common between fer and fb <dig> contamination: qfer- <dig>  and qfb1- <dig> , and qfer- <dig> and qfb1- <dig>  and − <dig>  . in particular, we focused on differentially expressed genes  found in a previous transcriptomic comparison of resistant co <dig> and susceptible co <dig> genotypes at 72 h after f. verticillioides inoculation  <cit> . the full list of degs included in the 2-lod interval of the above mentioned regions and in the other six qtls in common to both traits are reported in additional file 7: table s <dig> 

ten degs were located within the qfer- <dig> /qfb1- <dig> 1-lod confidence interval and  <dig> for qfer-7/qfb1- <dig>  and - <dig>  . among these, degs were firstly selected on the basis of their expression levels and secondly on their known role in plant defense . degs were subsequently divided in “constitutive”, if differentially expressed between uninoculated co <dig> and co <dig> control samples, and “modulated”, if differentially expressed between inoculated and control samples of either or both genotypes.table  <dig> differentially expressed genes among co <dig> and co <dig> genotypes within qtl regions in common between fusarium ear rot and fumonisin b <dig> contamination traits

among the ten degs in the  <dig>  mb 1-lod interval associated to qfer- <dig>  and qfb1- <dig>  two genes showed different constitutive expressions between genotypes in the uninoculated controls and eight were specifically modulated upon infection . beside genes with unknown function , genes with low expression level  and genes currently not known to be related to defense , five genes potentially related to f. verticillioides resistance were identified: a constitutively expressed thioredoxin  and the genes modulated upon inoculation, namely the lipoxygenase lox <dig>  a heat shock protein   involved in response to stress, a mlo defense gene  and a serine threonine-protein kinase-like gene , related to resistance and signal transduction, respectively . the genes involved in response to stress showed large differential expression among genotypes, with the thioredoxin gene constitutively expressed up to  <dig> times more in co <dig> in comparison to co <dig>  and the hsp induced after inoculation more than twice in the susceptible genotype . f. verticillioides inoculation led to lox <dig> induction up to  <dig> and  <dig>  times in the susceptible and resistant genotype, respectively.

a total of  <dig> degs associated to qfer- <dig>  qfb1- <dig>  and − <dig>  were present in the  <dig>  mb interval. one third of them  were differentially regulated among co <dig> and co <dig> genotypes at the constitutive level  and a large part were hypothetical proteins  or had unknown function . from the total list of  <dig> degs, we focused on  <dig> based on expression values and known function . among the stress-related proteins, the early-responsive to dehydration stress-related protein , two hsps and a transcription factor regulating their activation  were included in this interval. the avr <dig> elicitor response protein gene , involved in resistance, was modulated in both genotypes after inoculation, as well as a phosphate carrier mitochondrial-like , which increased  <dig> and  <dig> times after inoculation in the resistant and susceptible genotypes, respectively. genes involved in signal transduction included a cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinase 10-like  and a wrky transcription factor , both modulated after inoculation, and the constitutively expressed transcriptional adaptor family protein . four apetala 2/ethylene responsive element binding protein transcription factors  were constitutively expressed , or regulated after pathogen inoculation in both genotypes , or induced only in the susceptible genotype . the ocs element-binding factor  <dig>  was significantly induced  after inoculation in co <dig>  other genes differentially expressed encoded rna-binding protein rbp <dig>  and a carbohydrate transmembrane transporter , which were 227- and 153-fold more constitutively expressed in the resistant line, respectively. the monoglyceride lipase-like  redoubled its expression value after inoculation in the resistant line, while the s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase  increased four-fold its expression. notably, the hypothetical protein zeammb73_ <dig>  was constitutively expressed  <dig> -fold in the resistant genotype.

a larger number of candidate genes for resistance could be obtained considering the 2-lod confidence intervals around the lod peak . whilst 2-lod intervals of qfer- <dig> and qfb1- <dig>  and − <dig>  corresponded to 1-lod extremes, the 2-lod region associated to qfer- <dig>  and qfb1- <dig> spanned 40 mb and included the resistance-related hypersensitive-induced response protein  and the rpm1-interacting protein 4-like  and the stress-related ascorbate peroxidase .

in the other qtls regions in common between fer and fb <dig> traits some genes are noteworthy because of their expression values: the stress related-like protein interactor  in qfer-1/qfb1- <dig> , the glutathione s-transferase  in qfer-3/qfb1- <dig>  the platz transcription factor family member , the ethylene-responsive factor-like protein  <dig>  and the hsp  <dig>  in qfer- <dig> /qfb1- <dig> , the hsp70- <dig>  and the apx  in qfer- <dig> /qfb1- <dig> , the vicilin-like antimicrobial peptide 2– <dig>  in qfer- <dig> /qfb1- <dig>  .

discussion
fer disease incidence and fb <dig> accumulation in the f <dig> population
fer and fumonisin contamination are influenced by many environmental factors and test sites with consistently high disease pressure are required for genetic analysis of these traits  <cit> . in general, low rainfall and high temperature around flowering, and high rainfall or high temperature just before harvest, were found to favor fumonisin contamination  <cit> . in the present study, temperatures and relative humidity were significantly different in the 2 years of phenotyping, but no significant changes occurred between the two sowing times within the same year. in particular, both flowering and post-inoculation periods in  <dig> were characterized by significantly higher temperatures and lower relative humidity compared to  <dig> 

significant differences among groups determined by years, inoculation technique and sowing times were recorded for both fer severity and fb <dig> contamination. consistent with climatic patterns, fer severity and fb <dig> contamination were significantly higher in 2012b, when higher temperatures and lower relative humidity also accelerated flowering .

the distributions of fer and fb <dig> traits in the f <dig> population revealed the presence of transgressive segregants, i.e., families performing outside the parental range. transgressive segregants were observed in populations screened for fer and fumonisin contamination  <cit> , but also for gibberella ear rot , caused by f. graminearum, and deoxynivalenol  and zearalenone  contamination . this phenomenon occurs because of the accumulation of favorable and unfavorable alleles originating from both parental lines  and/or epistatic interactions. in the present study, identification of offspring outperforming the resistant parent co <dig> provides a starting point for improvement of fusarium and fumonisin resistance in breeding programs.

the low positive significant correlations , detected in  <dig> and  <dig> between flowering time  and fb <dig> contamination, suggested that in few maize genotypes late flowering is associated with higher fumonisin content. on the other side, significant low positive correlations between dts and fer were found only in  <dig>  suggesting that fumonisin content is more influenced than disease severity by the plant developmental stage. it was demonstrated that early flowering hybrids normally show reduced ear rot severity and mycotoxin contamination  <cit> . nonetheless, higher temperatures, occurred in  <dig>  might affect both flowering and the fb <dig> content. further analyses are needed to establish if the correlation between ear rot and silking date arises from linkage between resistance genes and early flowering genes.

since under natural conditions the pathogen is not evenly distributed in the field, artificial inoculation is key to ensure its equal distribution  <cit> . in our study, plants were artificially inoculated with either the side-needle or the toothpick inoculation technique. both techniques allowed to evaluate kernel resistance, although the parents were initially screened for silk channel resistance  <cit>  and the correlation between the two traits was low in certain genotypes  <cit> . moreover, injection through the ear husks resulted in higher levels of fumonisin concentration and infection severity  <cit> . in this study, both inoculation techniques allowed a reliable differentiation of genotypes for kernel resistance according to disease level and fumonisin content. regarding the comparison between the two inoculation techniques, they significantly affected fer severity more than sowing date and year: disease symptoms were lower in plants infected with the toothpick, but similar disease levels were found between 2011a, 2011b and 2012a. lower fer severity in toothpick-inoculated ears may be due to slower progress of pathogen growth when inoculated as mycelium in comparison to conidia, or to smaller diameter of the inoculation punch. on the other hand, fumonisin content was not clearly affected by the use of either inoculation technique. anyway, ease of use and similar efficacy in genotype screening make the side-needle inoculation technique preferable to the toothpick.

in contrast to most plant diseases, which can be simply visually rated, the evaluation of fumonisin contamination resistance requires time-consuming and expensive toxin assays. the high phenotypic correlation  between fer severity and fb <dig> contamination, determined in this study, demonstrated that analyses for mycotoxin content are only rarely needed. robertson and coworkers  <cit>  determined lower phenotypic correlations between these traits in two populations , but the strong genotypic correlations  suggested that selection for reduced ear rot should frequently identify lines with reduced fumonisin contamination. therefore, in breeding programs, selecting against ear rot may be a useful strategy for selecting genotypes with lower susceptibility to fumonisin contamination.

qtls for fer and fb <dig> contamination resistance
fifteen qtls for fer and seventeen for fb <dig> content were detected in the co441xco <dig> f <dig> population . all identified qtls had relatively small effects, explaining on the average  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation, with values ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig> %, in agreement with previous results  <cit> . the existence of favorable alleles for fer and fb <dig> contamination resistance in both parents can at least in part explain the presence of transgressive segregants in the progeny, with higher resistance or susceptibility than the co <dig> and co <dig> parents, respectively. additional mechanisms, such as epistasis and overdominance, may also play a role in this respect. while both parents carried equally the beneficial alleles for fer resistance, co <dig> contributed to most of the fb <dig> resistance qtls and was associated to some of qtls explaining the largest proportion of the phenotypic variation, as qfer- <dig>   and qfb1- <dig>  . dominance effects were detected for most of the alleles contributing to resistance, except qfer- <dig>  qfer- <dig> , qfer- <dig>  qfer- <dig>  qfer- <dig>  qfer- <dig> , qfer- <dig> , qfb1- <dig> , qfb1- <dig> , qfb1- <dig> and qfb1- <dig> .

comparing the positions of qtls for fer and fb <dig>  few correspondences were found with previously identified qtls , probably due to the different sources of resistance used in previous studies . indeed, limited consistency across populations was already noted by other authors evaluating different populations sharing a common parent  <cit> , or completely different parents  <cit> . in particular, only three fer and two fumonisin contamination resistance qtls mapped to similar positions in the gefr  and ncb  populations  <cit> .

surprisingly, a high correspondence was detected with qtls related to f. graminearum resistance, causing ger and the contamination of maize grains with zea and don mycotoxins . the parental lines employed in the present study were initially selected for f. graminearum resistance, but showed analogous levels of resistance to fer and common smut   <cit> . indeed, a cross with parent co <dig> was recently used to detect qtls related to ger resistance  <cit> . resistant sources to multiple maize pathogens, such as f. verticillioides, f. graminearum and a. flavus were found, suggesting the presence of a common genetic mechanism regulating resistance to different diseases  <cit> . in selected resistant and susceptible genotypes for fumonisin contamination, the genotypic correlations between fer, aspergillus ear rot , fumonisin and aflatoxin contamination were always greater than the phenotypic correlations, highlighting again the central role of the environmental factors on the phenotype  <cit> .

interestingly, eight qtl positions detected in this study overlapped between fer and fb <dig> contamination, suggesting the existence of genetic mechanisms controlling susceptibility/resistance to both traits. the high phenotypic correlations between the two traits found in this study  and the high genetic correlations found in the gefr and ncb populations   <cit> , demonstrate feasibility of mas of genotypes showing resistance to both fer and fb <dig> contamination.

among the overlapping qtls between the two traits, the co <dig> line contributed to fer resistance and low fb <dig> contamination in qtls located on the lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , while co <dig> line carried the favorable alleles on lg  <dig> and lg  <dig>  the overlapping qfer- <dig> and qfb1- <dig>  and - <dig>  qtls were stable across years and sowings, with r <dig> ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. the qfer- <dig> and qfb1- <dig> qtls were detected in different years, explaining  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation, respectively. to our knowledge, these qtls on lg  <dig> and lg  <dig> were never mapped previously neither for resistance to f. verticillioides, nor f. graminearum or a. flavus. these genomic regions, which derived both from co <dig> line and are associated to resistance to both traits across years, are promising targets for the improvement of f. verticillioides resistance in maize.

lg  <dig> showed numerous consistent qtls localized in four regions: qfer- <dig> , qfer- <dig> , qfer- <dig>  and the overlapping qfer- <dig>  and qfb1- <dig>  both associated with ssr bnlg <dig>  the latter qtls, detected in both years, explained a large amount of the phenotypic variation, with r <dig> for fer and fb <dig> contamination of maximum  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. similar bin positions were related to qtls associated to ger resistance and zea and don contamination reduction . in particular, bnlg <dig> was positioned, according to the ibm <dig>  <dig> neighbors <dig> map, less than 4 cm from umc <dig>  the nearest flanking marker of qtls for ger, zea, don resistance in a uh007xuh <dig> doubled haploid line population  <cit>  and co-located with bnlg <dig>  flanking marker in ger resistance qtls in uh009xuh <dig> doubled haploid lines  <cit>  and in co387xcg <dig> rils  <cit> . considering the stability of this qtl, which determined both fer and fb <dig> contamination, but also resistance towards f. graminearum, the genomic region around ssr bnlg <dig> is an interesting target for further dissection and candidate gene identification.

lg <dig> showed the presence of qtls for dts , fer  and fb <dig> contamination , explaining respectively  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation. moreover, qfer- <dig> was located near a qtl for don contamination reduction in bin  <dig>  between bnlg <dig> and umc <dig> markers  <cit> , as well as qtls for aflatoxin contamination in bin  <dig> , between bnlg <dig> and bnlg <dig> markers  <cit> , and in bin  <dig> , associated to bnlg <dig>  <cit> .

the qfb1- <dig>  qtl was localized in bin  <dig> , and  <dig> – <dig>  bins represent a region of clustered qtls for fer resistance  <cit> , ger resistance  <cit>  and aflatoxin resistance in several populations  <cit> . furthermore, snps associated with resistance to ger in a co441xb <dig> ril population were located close to qfer-1/qfb1- <dig> , qfer- <dig> , qfb1- <dig>  and qfer- <dig> /qfb1- <dig>   <cit> . similarly, qfb1- <dig> , qfb1- <dig> , qfer- <dig>  and qfb1- <dig>  localized in bin positions corresponding to qtls for ger resistance, zea and don contamination reduction  <cit> .

a qtl related to flowering  was co-located with a qtl for fumonisin contamination  and a qtl for fer , detected in late sowings of both years with an r <dig> of  <dig> %. also qdts- <dig> showed great stability across years and sowings, explaining  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation, in contrast to qfb1- <dig>  that was uncovered only in 2012a with a r <dig> equal to  <dig> %. association of disease resistance traits with maturity-related qtls was reported before  <cit> , reflecting the low positive correlation determined between the two traits. since the resistant parent contributed to these qtls, a pleiotropic gene effect between earliness in flowering, fer and fb <dig> contamination reduction may exist.

some qtls detected in our study overlapped with genomic regions previously associated with responses to other diseases. this is consistent with previous observations that qtls for different disease resistances have a tendency to map to similar genome locations, implying the existence of common genetic mechanisms regulating these traits  <cit> . a meta-qtl analysis, comprehending  <dig> individual qtls for fer, ger and aer resistance derived from  <dig> different studies, revealed the presence of  <dig> clusters of qtls , mainly localized on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . in our study, qtls associated to f. verticillioides response on lg  <dig> and lg  <dig> overlapped or were adjacent to qtls related to f. graminearum and a. flavus resistance, confirming the existence of clusters of resistance qtls. fine scale-genetic mapping will be necessary to distinguish linked qtls, such as those in a “resistance cluster”, from pleiotropic qtls that influence resistance to multiple fungi. interestingly, the canadian co <dig> inbred, developed for f. graminearum resistance as our parents, was the source that mostly contributed to resistance against fer, ger and aer in the meta-qtl analysis  <cit> .

recently, two genome-wide association studies were conducted on the maize core diversity panel inbred lines to detect allele variants associated with increased resistance to fer  <cit> . only two disease-associated snps mapped in similar positions to qtls detected in our study: the first snp, physically positioned at  <dig> , <dig>  was located within the 1-lod interval of the overlapping qfer- <dig> /qfb1- <dig> , and the second snp was less than 5 mb from the snp 2ch <dig> , <dig> associated to qfb1- <dig> .

the multifactorial nature of fusarium and fumonisin contamination resistance poses challenges to their genetic improvement through mas, which is most effective when few moderate-large effect qtls and consistent effects across breeding populations can be identified  <cit> . however, mas appears the most suitable technique for improving agronomically performing lines because of the high costs related to phenotyping. further studies using different populations derived from the co441xco <dig> cross and increasing the tested environments, will confirm the presence, the location and effects of fer and fb <dig> contamination qtls, minimizing the environmental effects on these traits.

in conclusion, the qtls mapped in this study are an important source for further studies on fer and fb <dig> contamination. the choice of the parents, with contrasting levels of fer and fb <dig> contamination, allowed an adequate segregation of these traits in the study population. moreover, the choice of a high-yielding resistant parent  provides an ideal basis for the selection of resistant hybrids with good agronomic performance in future breeding programs.

candidate genes for fer resistance
candidate genes for maize resistance to fer have been proposed in transcriptomic studies comparing the response of susceptible and resistant maize lines to f. verticillioides infection, suggesting that resistance of some genotypes may be mainly due to the constitutive expression of defense mechanisms . in this study, the genomic regions spanning qtls of particular interest were scanned for the presence of degs resulting from an rna-seq experiment led on the same two parents at 72 h post f. verticillioides inoculation  <cit> . two genomic regions in common between fer and fb <dig> traits were firstly considered as potential sources of genes for f. verticillioides resistance: qfer- <dig>  and qfb1- <dig>  which explained the highest phenotypic variation for fb <dig> trait, and qfer- <dig> and qfb1- <dig>  and − <dig>  which showed the greatest stability across years and sowings. the 1-lod confidence intervals of these regions harbored in total  <dig> degs, which could be considered potential candidates for f. verticillioides resistance and about one third of them  has unknown function. among degs associated to these intervals of interest,  <dig> were analyzed in more detail based on high expression levels and known defensive role .

in the region containing the qfer- <dig>  and qfb1- <dig> qtls, three genes related to stress response could be considered as valuable candidates for resistance: yptm <dig>  lox <dig> and 22 kda hsp. yptm <dig> was constitutively present in uninoculated controls of the resistant line and thioredoxins are known to protect plant tissues from oxidative damage produced by reactive oxygen species, triggered after pathogen recognition. in maize, lox <dig>  which resulted up-regulated in both genotypes after f. verticillioides inoculation  <cit> , is the only identified family member responsible for the production of jasmonic acid   <cit> , an oxylipin that mediate the response to necrotrophic pathogens, together with ethylene   <cit> . oxylipins are compounds involved in signaling and are implicated in plant-pathogen interactions and regulate mycotoxin production  <cit> . the role of loxs in maize-f. verticillioides interaction and other pathogen cross-talks was demonstrated by the use of maize mutants . moreover, loxs and other genes involved in oxylipin biosynthesis were induced earlier and more strongly in the resistant co <dig> inbred in comparison to co <dig> after f. verticillioides inoculation  <cit> . in the susceptible line, a gene coding for 22 kda hsp, involved in protein folding and stabilization, was specifically induced after inoculation  <cit> . similar results were observed in several susceptible and resistant maize inbreds after f. verticillioides and a. flavus inoculation  <cit> . the candidate genes in the region harboring the qfer- <dig>  and qfb1- <dig> qtls should be considered for further breeding studies which aim at developing highly resistant hybrids to multiple fungal pathogens, due to the proximity with qtls for f. graminearum resistance .

in the larger genomic region containing qfer- <dig> and qfb1- <dig>  and − <dig>  qtls, several hsps, constitutively expressed level or modulated after inoculation, could be considered as candidates for resistance. among transcription factors, wrky <dig> was f. verticillioides responsive in both genotypes. numerous members of the wrky family are associated to the plant immune response, starting the transcription of pathogenesis related genes  <cit> . several members of ap2/erf transcription factor superfamily mapped in this region and they are known to be induced by biotic and abiotic stresses and bind to the promoter regions of stress responsive genes, including defense-related genes, pathogenesis-related  genes, osmotin, chitinase and β- <dig> -glucanase  <cit> . the s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, a key enzyme for the synthesis of the polyamines, is involved in pathogen response  <cit>  and it was strongly up-regulated in the co <dig> genotype  <cit> . a higher constitutive expression in the resistant genotype of a carbohydrate transmembrane transporter, in comparison to co <dig>  might confirm the role of sucrose in mounting the defense response in the resistant plant by avoiding its reallocation forced by pathogens  <cit> .

in general, the parental contribution to a qtl reflected the expression levels of the harbored candidate genes, although exceptions were found. the expression values of the candidate genes in parents both before and after inoculation are provided as fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped  in e-h columns of additional file 7: table s <dig>  for example, the resistant parent contributed to qfer- <dig>  and qfb1- <dig> qtls and among the  <dig> degs within the qtl interval, three candidate genes  showed significantly higher constitutive expression in the resistant line in comparison to the susceptible one. lox <dig> was induced in both genotypes after inoculation with a greater fold change in the resistant line and two other genes were modulated after inoculation only in the resistant line . moreover, the defense mechanism may be identified in some cases as the down-regulation upon inoculation of the genes involved in susceptibility rather than the up-regulation of resistance genes. an example is given in qfer- <dig>  and qfb1- <dig> qtls by a  <dig>  kda hsp , which did not change after inoculation in the resistant line, contributing with beneficial allele to resistance, but it was significantly up-regulated in the susceptible line . smaller map intervals will allow a more precise identification of the genes involved in resistance and resolve the cases in which the parental contribution with beneficial alleles do not correspond to the observed gene expression levels.

finally, a genome-wide association study identified a fer-associated snp within the intron region of grmzm2g <dig>  positioned at  <dig>  mb from the cofactor marker associated to qfer- <dig> /qfb1- <dig>   <cit> . this gene, coding for a cellulose synthase-like family a protein, was not differentially expressed at 72 h post inoculation between the co <dig> and co <dig> parents  <cit>  and, due to the intronic position of the polymorphism, it is more likely that it is in linkage with the causal variant and not the causal variant itself  <cit> . the 1-lod interval of qfer- <dig> /qfb1- <dig>  harbors  <dig> degs, which could be considered candidate genes for resistance . in particular, the vicilin-like antimicrobial peptides 2– <dig>  was induced after inoculation in the co <dig> line reaching extremely high expression levels . moreover, the fer-associated snp was distant less than 4 mb from the 1-lod interval of the qfer- <dig> /qfb1- <dig>  qtls, which included numerous stress-related proteins, as apx , the in2- <dig> protein  and hsps  . therefore these adjacent genomic regions on lg  <dig> could represent interesting sources of allelic variation for fer and fb <dig> contamination resistance in maize.

CONCLUSIONS
ssr markers and gbs were applied in this study in order to identify qtls associated to fer and fb <dig> contamination in a biparental mapping population. as well as mapping small effect qtls for individual traits, we were able to uncover qtls in common between fer and fb <dig> resistance traits making possible the selection of maize genotypes showing both low disease severity and low fumonisin contamination. noteworthy are the overlapping qfer- <dig>  and qfb1- <dig> qtls, carried by the co <dig> parent, which could find a direct application in maize breeding programs focused on improvement of f. verticillioides resistance, since this line is an agronomically performing inbred. the qtls detected in this study were in some cases located close to qtls for resistance to other mycotoxigenic fungi, suggesting their use for selection of lines resistant to multiple ear rots. finally, candidate genes for resistance to f. verticillioides were identified combining previous transcriptomic data with qtl mapping, providing a set of genes that could be further studied to evaluate their usefulness in mas.
