BACKGROUND
type  <dig> diabetes is an autoimmune disease that results in the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas  <cit> . increasing evidence suggests that islet transplantation is a promising therapy for type  <dig> diabetes. however, the limited supply of donors for pancreatic islets severely limits this approach. the use of stem cells to produce a new population of functional beta cells may offer an alternative approach. embryonic and adult stem cells, including mesenchymal stem cells, hepatic oval cells, adult pancreatic stem cells, and pancreatic-ducts stem cells, are able to differentiate into insulin-secreting cells in vitro and correct hyperglycemia in diabetic animal models  <cit> .

recent studies have demonstrated that dermal fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into embryonic stem cell-like cells called induced pluripotent stem  cells by introducing several stem cell-associated genes  <cit> . tateishi et al. showed that dermal fibroblast-derived ips cells could also generate insulin secreting islet-like cells  <cit> , suggesting that ips cells might be a potential cell source for therapy. however, the genetic manipulation involved could be problematic for future clinical applications.

in our previous study, we isolated, expanded and characterized one clonal population from dermal fibroblasts, which is able to differentiate into mesodermal, ectodermal and endodermal progenies in vitro  <cit> . it is of great interest to know whether these cells can be further differentiated into functional insulin-producing cells. thus, the aim of this study was to establish clones from the human dermis with greater multipotency, and to investigate their potential to differentiate into pancreatic cells.

RESULTS
differentiation potential of single-cell derived dermal fibroblasts
in  <dig> of the 96-well plates  seeded,  <dig> wells contained a single-cell-derived clone, but only  <dig> clones could survive and be continuously expanded. the established clones exhibited a spindle-shaped morphology without obvious differences between each clone . after 23- <dig> cell-doublings, the cells were cultured in adipogenic, neurogenic and hepatogenic media to determine their differentiation potential. as expected, 34%  of the clones exhibited adipogenic differentiation potential and were positive for oil-red o staining after induction for  <dig> weeks . of these, only two clones  showed neurogenic and hepatogenic potential, as demonstrated by anti-ntr- <dig>  anti-gap- <dig>  anti-nf-m , anti-alb, and anti-hnf-3Î² staining . therefore, these two clones were termed multipotent dermal fibroblasts . interestingly, none of the clones possessed neurogenic or hepatogenic potential alone. these findings were consistent with those observed in our previous study  <cit> .

in vitro differentiation of mdfs into islet-like clusters
the existence of multipotent cells in cultured dermal fibroblasts prompted us to check whether these cells could be further differentiated into insulin producing cells. clones  <dig> and  <dig>  were treated with factors known to promote pancreatic differentiation. clone  <dig>  which only possesses adipogenic potential, was used as a control. after  <dig> days of induction, 20- <dig>  of spherical cell clusters were observed in each well of the six-well plate in clones  <dig> and  <dig>  however, cell clusters were not observed in clone  <dig>  or in the non-induced group . immunofluorescent staining showed that the cell clusters were positive for anti-insulin antibody staining . no staining was observed in the isotypic control group . it has been reported that immunoreactivity of insulin in the cell clusters might due to the uptake of insulin from culture media  <cit> . therefore, pancreatic differentiation was further confirmed by anti-c-peptide antibody staining . positive staining was observed in clone  <dig> and  <dig>  in addition, to rule out the non-specific staining, cell clusters were picked out, dissociated by typsin, and single cells were seeded on cover glasses for  <dig> hours. immunofluoresent staining for anti-c-peptide was then repeated. again, positive staining was observed in clone  <dig> and  <dig>  but not in clone  <dig> .

to characterize the pancreatic differentiation in more detail, immunofluorescent staining of other pancreatic endocrine hormones was performed, including glucagon, which is synthesized and secreted from alpha cells of the islets, and somatostatin, which is secreted from delta cells of the islets. interestingly, the cell clusters in the induced clones  <dig> and  <dig> were positive for anti-glucagon and anti-somatostatin staining, whereas clone  <dig> was not .

the gene expression profile analyzed by rt-pcr further confirmed the pancreatic differentiation of mdfs. as shown in figure  <dig>  pancreatic developmental transcription factors, including pdx- <dig>  isl- <dig>  neurod, nkx  <dig> , ngn <dig> and pax- <dig>  were not detectable in the non-induced cells. by contrast, these factors were upregulated in induced mdfs . the islet-specific hormones insulin and glucagon were also upregulated in these cells after pancreatic induction, together with a glucose transporter gene . by contrast, there was no expression of pancreatic genes in clone  <dig>  with or without induction. vimentin, the mesoderm marker, was expressed in all of the cells tested here. all of these data support the concept that mdfs can be differentiated into islet-like cells under pancreatic induction.

release of insulin in response to glucose stimulation
to determine whether the differentiated mdfs  were responsive to glucose challenge, insulin release after exposure to high glucose was measured using human insulin elisa kit. clone  <dig> and  <dig> were measured separately and each clone was repeated three times. similar pattern of glucose response were achieved in both clones. therefore, data from those two clones were summarized in figure  <dig>  the insulin secretion was gradually increased with the increase in glucose concentration from  <dig> mm to  <dig>  mm in differentiated mdfs. however, secretion did not increase further at a higher glucose concentration . one-way anova showed significant differences between groups . comparing with non-stimulated group , significant differences  were observed in the groups with glucose stimulation at  <dig> mm or  <dig>  mm, but not in the other groups . in addition, significant differences were also observed in those two groups  comparing with the one stimulated with glucose at  <dig>  mm. these data indicate that islet-like cell clusters derived from mdfs could secrete insulin in response to glucose stimulation at a very limited level.

discussion
numerous studies have demonstrated the presence of stem cells in the adult dermis  <cit> . our previous study revealed that dermal fibroblasts are a heterogeneous population that contains cells with variable differentiation potential  <cit> . in the present study, we confirmed that a small population of cells from human foreskin is multipotent. these cells could be differentiated into neuron-, adipocyte- and hepatocyte-like cells in the presence of certain factors. more importantly, these cells could differentiate into islet-like cells capable of expressing insulin, glucagon and somatostatin after pancreatic induction. in addition, the islet-like clusters could release insulin in response to glucose in vitro.

pancreatic differentiation of mdfs has been demonstrated by the expression of pancreatic genes at the mrna  level. although, immunoreactivity of insulin was observed in the cell clusters after induction , it can not rule out the possibility that the insulin is trapped in clusters, since the media contains fbs/insulin  <cit> . by anti-c-peptide immunostaining, we confirmed that induced cells do express insulin . unfortunately, the functional assay showed that the islet-like cells released insulin in response to glucose stimulation with limited ability . the low insulin secretory capacity may be due to the loss of stem cell properties during mdf expansion. we have found that cells after  <dig> cell-doublings completely lose their multipotency . thus, the cells investigated in this study  were close to their capacity. optimal cell expansion conditions are worth to be investigated to improve the pancreatic differentiation ability. meanwhile, the in vivo function of insulin-producing cells is under investigation in diabetic animals.

vimentin is the marker of mensenchymal cells. the mdfs express vimentin even after pancreatic induction . although there have been reports of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  of pancreatic islet cells and differentiation of such cells back to insulin-producing cells  <cit> , it is hard to believe that skin epithelial cells undergo emt to differentiate into pancreatic cells. guo et al. reported that skin-derived precursors  from mouse, which express nestin but not vimentin, could also be differentiated into insulin producing cells <cit> , indicating that emt is not likely the mechanisms for differentiation of skin cells to pancreatic cells. as we discussed previously, the relationship between skps and the multipotent dermal fibroblasts in our study is still unclear  <cit> . nevertheless, it supports our findings that skin contains multipotent cells that could be differentiated into islet-like cells.

the finding that mdfs could give rise to cells of three germ layers is surprising. interestingly, similar types of multipotent cells have been isolated from other adult tissues, such as spermatogonial stem cells in the adult testis  <cit>  and very small embryonic-like  stem cells in the bone marrow  <cit> . kucia et al. speculated that the multipotent stem cells in adult tissues might be derived from early embryonic cells that reside in different tissues during developmental process and are maintained to the adult stage  <cit> . it could be speculated that those mdfs might be derived from residual undifferentiated cells in the dermis. to further localize these cells in the dermis and to enrich them from the pooled population, the characteristics unique to these cells are under investigation.

recent studies have demonstrated that the ips cells derived from reprogramming of dermal fibroblasts are multipotent and could generate insulin secreting islet-like cells  <cit> . the relationship between mdfs and ips cells should also be investigated. kim et al. demonstrated that the induction of ips from stem cells seems to be easier than that from differentiated cells  <cit> . one possibility is that the reprogramming process might mainly occur in mdfs rather than in the differentiated dermal fibroblasts. thus, only mdfs could selectively expand in culture. moreover, the number of reprogramming factors could be reduced when using mdfs as a target. further studies are needed to answer these questions.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this is the first study to demonstrate that multipotent dermal fibroblasts could be differentiated into islet-like cells without genetic manipulation. this approach might offer a safer cell source for future stem cell-based therapies.
