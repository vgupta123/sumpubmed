BACKGROUND
complex metabolic diseases such as obesity and type  <dig> diabetes  and physical activity levels have long been recognised as being closely-related. for instance, it has been shown that elite athletes or former elite athletes tend to have longer life expectancies, and lower risks of complex metabolic diseases such as obesity and t2d, than matched sedentary controls  <cit> . genetic factors seem to play a role in elite athlete development, on one hand  <cit> , and the predisposing for complex metabolic diseases, on the other hand  <cit> . recently, we  <cit>  and others  <cit>  hypothesised that genetic single nucleotide polymorphisms , including snps identified in genome wide association studies  that have been associated with increased risk for complex metabolic diseases, would also be candidates to influence athletic performance/physical activity levels.

the a/t polymorphism  in the fat mass and obesity associated  gene, was discovered in two separate gwas  <cit> , and is an example of specific variant associated with obesity, 2td, and physical activity levels. recent meta-analysis combining data from adults and children, and an adolescent population  have shown that physically active people with the fto risk allele are 30% less likely to be obese compared to their inactive counterparts  <cit> . visfatin, a recently discovered adipokine that contributes to glucose and obesity-related conditions, is another gene that potentially influences both exercise-related phenotypes and complex metabolic diseases. rs <dig> within the visfatin was associated with aerobic exercise training-induced changes in glucose and obesity-related phenotypes  <cit> . the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator1α  gly482ser snp was also associated with increased risk of obesity and type  <dig> diabetes  <cit>  on one hand, and with elite athletic performance  <cit> , on the other hand.

the outcomes of the abovementioned studies assist with understanding the genomic link between complex metabolic diseases and athletic performance; however the widely accepted hypothesis is that there are likely to be many other uncovered variants with dual effects. in that sense, elite athletes represent the end point of the human physical activity continuum with a “rare” and distinguished phenotype, and hence are an excellent model to study.

potential obesity and t2d-related genetic variants that may influence athletic performance as well are located in the igf2bp <dig>  lpl, kcjn, and mthfr genes. igf2bp <dig> rs <dig> g > t variant is associated with predisposition to t2d and obesity. gwas studies have indicated that the risk allele for t2d and obesity is the t allele. animal model and human studies implicate this variant with reduced beta-cell function, insulin secretion and sensitivity and with raised fasting glucose levels  <cit> . importantly, recent studies suggest a potential role for igf2bp <dig> in skeletal muscle cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . lpl rs <dig> and rs <dig> snps have been associated with plasma lipids levels, through the protein’s role in the uptake of free fatty acids  from the plasma to tissues, including muscle cells  <cit> . thus, it has been hypothesised that these snps may alter the availability of ffa to muscle cells and to the utilization of fat by muscles. the obesity risk allele/genotype for both rs <dig> and rs <dig> are g allele and the gg genotype. kcnj <dig> is an atp-sensitive k+  channel, which couples cell metabolism with membrane excitability in various cell types, including muscle cells. the protein’s known function is mainly related to diabetes phenotypes  <cit> . however, it was also found to be association with impaired exercise stress response in several models. the e23k snp at codon  <dig> of the kcnj <dig> gene  results in substitution of glutamic acid to lysine, and may cause modest reductions in atp sensitivity, which could influence muscle response to exercise. the metabolic risk allele/genotype in rs <dig> is t/tt. mthfr is a key enzyme in one carbon cycle. mthfr c677t snp results in elevated plasma homocysteine, which has been linked to reduced mobility and muscle functioning in the elderly  and has been associated with t2d. the risk allele/genotype in rs <dig> is t/tt  <cit> .

therefore, we studied the association between these five genetic variants associated with both obesity and obesity co-morbidities  and elite athletic status in a relatively-large cohort  of sprint/power and endurance athletes. we also examined the association between these variants and athletic status according to the athletes’ level of competition . we hypothesised that the obesity and/or co-morbidities risk allele/genotype in each of these variants would be underrepresented in elite athletes compared to controls.

methods
the study was approved by the pomeranian medical university ethics committee, poland, and the ural state university of physical culture, russia, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. the study complied with the guidelines set out in the declaration of helsinki and the ethics policy of the szczecin university  <cit> .

participants
a total of  <dig> male participants from russia  and poland  were involved in the study. the russian participants included  <dig> athletes  and  <dig> unrelated sedentary controls . the polish participants were  <dig> athletes  and  <dig> unrelated sedentary controls . all athletes were ranked in the top  <dig> nationally in their sport discipline and grouped as being either ‘elite-level’ or ‘national-level’ based on their best personal performance. those in the elite group had participated in international competitions such as world and european championships, and/or olympic games, whereas those in the national-level group had participated in national competitions only. athletes were further classified as endurance .

russian athletes
this group included  <dig>  endurance athletes and  <dig>  sprint/power athletes. athletes in classified as endurance athletes included cross country skiers , marathon runners , rowers , 1500-5000 m runners , 5000/ <dig> 000 m long distance skaters , 3000 m steeple chase , 1500 m swimmers  and walkers . athletes classified as sprint/power athletes came from sports including ski-cross/ alpine skiing , discus throw , greco-roman wrestling , pole vault , 200 m sprint , 100 m sprint , 400 m sprint , 500 m short distance skating , 50/100 m short distance swimming , and power lifters .

polish athletes
this group included  <dig>  endurance athletes and  <dig>  sprint/power athletes. athletes classified as endurance athletes included canoeists , cross country skiers , cyclists ,  <dig> 00 m/marathon runners , rowers , 1500 m swimmers , and triathletes . the sprint/power athletes included 100/200 m runners , archers , weight/ power lifters , high jumpers , javelin throwers , long jumpers , vaulters , shooters , shot putters , 500 m short-distance skaters  sky jumpers  and 50/100 m swimmers .

genotyping
in the polish cohort, genomic dna was isolated from buccal epithelium using genelute mammalian genomic dna miniprep kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. in the russian cohort, genomic dna was isolated from buccal epithelium or peripheral blood, during the years 2011- <dig>  using the diatom™ dna prep kit . genotyping was performed as previously described  <cit> . in the russian cohort, genotyping of four snps  was performed by single-base extension  method. the sequence surrounding each snp was obtained from the genome reference consortium human genome build  <dig> assembly from the ensembl project . the primer3web software v.  <dig> . <dig>  was used for designing the pcr primers. genotyping of the mthfr rs <dig> polymorphism was performed by using a taqman® snp genotyping assay with a stepone™ real-time pcr system . the assay id was c___1202883_ <dig>  the results were analysed by using taqman® genotyper software . k <dig> dna high molecular weight from promega corp.  served as a positive control sample. genetic profile of the k <dig> dna was as follow: igfbp <dig> rs <dig> – g/g, kcjn <dig> rs <dig> – c/t, lpl rs <dig> – g/g, lpl rs <dig> – g/c, and mthfr rs <dig> – g/g.

in the polish cohort, all samples were genotyped in duplicate using allelic discrimination assays with taqman® probes  on a cfx <dig> touch™ real-time pcr detection system . to discriminate rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  and rs <dig> alleles, taqman® pre-designed snp genotyping assays were used , including appropriate primers and fluorescently labeled  mgb™ probes to detect the alleles.

genotyping reliability across two laboratories
as previously described  <cit>  genotyping was performed in duplicate in the same laboratory for accuracy. two independent investigators have called the genotyping score in each laboratory-100% of the genotypes could be called. for the purpose of results reliability across two laboratories in two different countries , different dna samples  were shipped from russia to poland and were genotyped by taqman assays. the results of the genotyping were in 100% agreement across the two laboratories.

statistical analysis
chi squared tests were used to test for the presence of hardy-weinberg equilibrium . hwe was tested separately for each snp. genotype frequencies were compared according to athletic status  using fisher’s exact test. multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between genotype and athletic status/competition level. nationality was adjusted for in the first stage of analysis as there were nationality distribution differences in each athletic status groups and the control group. the homozygous non-risk allele genotype was chosen as the reference genotype for each analysis, with comparisons made to the heterozygous genotype and the homozygous risk allele genotype . additional comparisons were made to assess the dominant and recessive models, as described in our work  <cit> . significance between these planned comparisons was accepted when p ≤  <dig> . odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were also calculated for estimation of the risk effect.

discussion
we studied the association between five obesity and co-morbidities-related genetic variants  and athletic status in a well-defined  athletic population. we found a significant association between igf2bp <dig> rs <dig> and lpl rs <dig> and athletic status; endurance athletes are less likely to have the metabolic risk igf2bp <dig> t and lpl rs <dig> g alleles compared with sprint/power athletes and controls, respectively. these results suggest that male endurance athletes might be genetically predisposed toward a reduced risk of developing metabolic morbidities, compared with sprint/power athletes and the general population.

previous studies have demonstrated that genetic variants associated with predisposition to obesity are also associated with responsiveness to exercise training  <cit> . only a handful of variants, however, were replicated in multiple cohorts mainly due to variability in exercise training level, different ethnicity, gender, age, and cohorts with different metabolic states. to overcome some of the past studies challenges, including variability in physical activity status, different ethnicity and gender, we recruited a relatively- large cohort of caucasians athletes with a well-defined athletic phenotype.

igf2bp <dig>  also referred to as imp <dig>  belongs to a mrna-binding protein family involved in the development and stimulation of insulin action. the igf binding protein family plays a role in modulation of igf <dig> translation in a tissue-specific and developmental manner  <cit> . several gwas have found that carriers of the minor alleles in snps rs <dig> and rs <dig> have moderately increased risk for t2d. this association was confirmed across different ethnicities and populations  <cit> . furthermore, a recent meta-analysis of  <dig> independent studies confirmed this association in european, east asian and south asian populations  <cit> .

the intron 2 g > t substitution in the igf2bp <dig> rs <dig> is particularly interesting and has attracted the most attention in obesity and t2d studies. the snp is located in the second, large igf2bp <dig> intron; thus, it is not yet clear how it generates its effect, whether directly through regulatory effects or indirectly through other genes. however, in the context of t2d, animal model and human studies implicate a role for this variant in beta-cell function, insulin secretion and sensitivity, and with elevated fasting glucose levels  <cit> . importantly, recent studies suggest a potential role for igf2bp <dig> protein in skeletal muscle cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . in the present study we have demonstrated that endurance athletes are less likely to have the metabolic risk alleles of igf2bp <dig> compared to sprint/power athletes who are twice as much likely to have the metabolic risk allele  compared to endurance athletes.

an additional finding in the present study is that endurance athletes are less likely to have the metabolic risk, g allele, of lpl rs <dig>  compared with controls. lpl plays a pivotal role in lipid metabolism by hydrolysing triglyceride -rich lipoproteins. dysfunction of lpl protein increased the susceptibility for developing several common diseases, including atherosclerosis and obesity  <cit> . lpl rs <dig> or hindiii  is a common variant in the lpl gene that has been associated with plasma lipid profile  <cit> . although a large number of variants have been identified in the lpl gene, rs <dig> is of particular interest because of its common occurrence in many populations. due to lpl rs320′s location within an intron, it was not initially considered functional but rather in linkage disequilibrium with a putative functional variant, such as lpl rs <dig>  however, recent findings suggests that the lpl rs <dig> may be functional by altering the binding of a transcription factor and impacting lpl expression  <cit> . we found that sedentary controls are more likely to have the risk variant compared with endurance athletes and thus, might in more risk to develop elevated blood lipids and cardio vascular disease  <cit> .

a possible explanation to the underrepresentation of metabolic diseases risk alleles in endurance athletes arising from studies that evaluated the overall risk of athletes for metabolic and cardiovascular disease. guo et al.,  <cit>  have shown that professional strength-oriented athletes at the heaviest-weight-class are at a significant increased risk for cardiometabolic disease compared with those at all other weight categories. similarly, urho et al.,  <cit>  found that, compared with controls, strength/power-sports athletes had a higher risk for high body mass index , whereas former endurance athletes had the lowest odds ratios for t2d and ischemic heart disease. these studies reinforce our hypothesis that endurance athletes would be at lower risk for complex metabolic diseases compared to sprint/power athletes, and controls, and genetics might be, at least partly, behind these differences.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we found a significant association between igf2bp <dig> and lpl snps and athletic status in males: endurance athletes are less likely to have the metabolic risk alleles of igf2bp <dig> rs <dig> and lpl rs <dig>  compared to sprint/power athletes and controls. these results suggest that some snps across the human genome have dual effect and may predispose endurance athletes to reduced risk of developing metabolic morbidities, whereas sprint/power athletes might be predisposed to elevated risk. these results need to be confirmed in athlete cohorts with different geographical backgrounds. future studies should also measure obesity-related intermediate phenotypes, such as fasting blood glucose levels and plasma lipids that could lend support for the associations.
