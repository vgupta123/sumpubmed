BACKGROUND
matrix metalloproteinases   <dig> and  <dig> are two gelatinase members which have been measured and found to be elevated in pleural exudates of different origin . mmps consist a family of proteolytic enzymes that break down virtually all the protein components of the extracellular matrix. the balance between matrix deposition and degradation is tightly regulated in human tissues and a disruption of this balance has been implicated in several pathological conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases and arthritis  <cit> . mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> are thought to be involved in pleural fluid accumulation in the pleural cavity. the disruption of the integrity of the mesothelial layer or the underlying basement membrane, and therefore the facilitation of fluid influx into the pleural space has been proposed as a possible mechanism  <cit> , although no study has been so far conducted.

mmps have been correlated with the induction of increased capillary permeability in several inflammatory conditions, such as brain and myocardium ischemia injury and diabetic retinopathy  <cit> . in in vitro studies of endothelial cells, mmps increase paracellular permeability by disrupting tight junction barrier  <cit> . tight junctions  are a specific type of cell-cell contacts that obstruct paracellular pathway for solute diffusion and they regulate the paracellular passage of small molecules such as water and ions  <cit> . the two major constituent proteins of tjs are occludin and claudin and the disruption of these proteins in several culture systems has been correlated with increased water and solute flux  <cit> .

this study was designed in order to investigate if mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> increase the permeability of sheep pleura and thus contribute to the pathogenesis of pleural effusion formation. the effect of mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> on tj proteins occludin and claudin- <dig> was examined in order to investigate if mmps alter paracellular permeability of the mesothelial layer.

RESULTS
mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> decrease the transmesothelial resistance of parietal and visceral sheep pleura
we treated parietal and visceral sheep pleura specimens with increasing doses of mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  and the rtm was measured over a 40-min period. the rtm decreased in all concentrations studied and this decrease occurred at both parietal and visceral pleura and on both the apical and basolateral side. the decline in rtm suggests for an increase in the permeability of the tissue. as control rtm , we regarded the rtm of the tissue before mmp was added. the mean rtm of parietal pleura was calculated to be  <dig> ±  <dig> Ωcm <dig> and that of visceral pleura  <dig> ±  <dig> Ωcm <dig>  sheets of pleura specimens, at which no mmps where applied, showed a stable value of rtm at least for a period of  <dig> min .

a time-dependent response occurred both apically and basolaterally for all four concentrations studied. after the addition of mmps, the rtm decreased significantly and declined progressively thereafter up to the  <dig> min of incubation when the experiment was terminated . a significant drop in resistance occurred within 5- <dig> min for both concentrations  <dig>   and  <dig> ng/ml . however a delayed response was observed when  <dig>  ng/ml mmp <dig> was incubated with the apical side of the visceral membrane . the effect of  <dig>  ng/ml mmp <dig> on the apical side of the parietal pleura was not significant . the changes in rtm for concentrations  <dig> and  <dig> ng/ml were comparable to these for  <dig>  and  <dig> ng/ml .

a dose-dependent response was observed for both mmps studied : for mmp <dig> the decrease in rtm was greatest on the apical side of parietal pleura at concentration  <dig> ng/ml . for mmp <dig> the greatest effect was observed on the basolateral side of the parietal pleura at the low concentration of  <dig>  ng/ml .

timp <dig> partially prevented the decrease in rtm induced by mmps
next, the mmp inhibitor timp <dig>  was applied to the pleura either alone or simultaneously with mmp <dig> at concentration  <dig> ng/ml or mmp <dig> at concentration  <dig>  ng/ml. these concentrations of mmps were chosen because of their maximum effect on rtm. timp <dig> was shown to partially prevent the mmp <dig>  and mmp9-induced  fall in rtm. this effect was obvious on both the parietal and visceral pleura. moreover, the application of timp <dig> by itself tended to increase pleural permeability, particularly at visceral pleura and at its basolateral side, as the rtm was  <dig> ± 5% of control value on the 40th min .

mmp <dig> or mmp <dig> do not alter occludin and claudin- <dig> immunostaining at cell cultures
we next investigated if the increase in transmesothelial permeability, as occurred by ussing chamber experiments, is accompanied by loss of tight junction proteins by indirect immunofluorescence. the mesothelial cells in control experiments showed a clear membrane pattern for occludin  and claudin- <dig> staining . the staining was continuous and decorated the cell periphery. because cells were well grown to confluency and occludin and claudin- <dig> are located at sites of lateral membrane with cell-cell contact, a continuous line resembling to "honeycomb" pattern was obvious. non-specific staining of the nucleus occurred. the incubation of mesothelial cells with mmps had no effect on occludin and claudin- <dig> immunostaining , implying that mmps do not alter occludin and claudin- <dig> localization at tight junctions.

mmp <dig> or mmp <dig> do not alter occludin and claudin- <dig> expression at mesothelial cells
western blotting of mesothelial cell extracts showed no alteration for occludin and claudin- <dig> staining . occludin migrated as two main bands with apparent molecular weights from  <dig> to  <dig> kda. an additional band at about  <dig> kda was also detected . claudin- <dig> was detected as a  <dig> kda band . neither loss of band intensity nor the appearance of new protein fragments was observed. these findings imply that mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> do not degrade tj proteins.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in the present study mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> decreased the transmesothelial resistance of parietal and visceral sheep pleura in in vitro experiments. this decrease supports that mmps augment pleural mesothelial permeability. the paracellular pathway, through which mesothelial permeability may increase, was studied. after incubation of primary mesothelial cells with mmp <dig> or mmp <dig>  mesothelial monolayer integrity was not disrupted and the expression of tj proteins occludin and claudin- <dig> in the cytoplasmic membrane remained intact.

mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> were selected for our study because they have been found elevated in exudative pleural effusions of different origin  <cit> . mmp <dig> is expressed and secreted constitutively in the pleural cavity by mesothelial cells  <cit> . in exudates high levels of mmp <dig> may be due to increased expression as a result of stimulation of mesothelial cells by cytokines or other cells, such as mononuclear cells, might collaborate in mmp <dig> release  <cit> . mmps can degrade almost all components of the extracellular matrix  and to date it is widely known that mmps can cleave not only ecm components, such as collagen and elastin, but also non-ecm protein substrates, such as cell surface molecules, ecm-bound growth factors and cytokines released on the ecm  <cit> .

in the present study the decrease in transmesothelial electrical resistance of sheep pleura that occurs after incubation with mmp <dig> or mmp <dig> suggests for an increase in the permeability of the pleura. as expected for an enzyme, the decrease in resistance of the pleura was time-dependent with the maximum decline in resistance occurring on the  <dig> min. regarding the dose-dependent effect, a remarkable difference between mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> occurred: for mmp <dig> the greatest increase in permeability occurred at the highest concentration studied, which is  <dig> ng/ml. on the contrary, for mmp <dig> the greatest increase in permeability occurred at the lowest concentration studied, which is  <dig>  ng/ml. the reason for this discrepancy is not elucidated but we should take into account differences between enzyme kinetics and substrate specificity.

timp <dig> is a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases and inhibits mmps activity by binding noncovalently to their active site  <cit> . timp <dig> is found in exudates whereas in transudates its levels are usually no detectable  <cit> . the application of timp <dig> on the pleura inhibited the decrease in rtm which was induced by mmps on both the parietal and visceral pleura. this finding enhances our previous finding and suggests that the decline in rtm is an effect caused by mmps and not a non-pecific result. timp <dig> was selected at the present study because it is 2- <dig> times more effective than timp <dig> for the inhibition of mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> activity  <cit> . moreover, timp <dig> tended to increase pleural permeability particularly at visceral pleura and at its basolateral side, when it was applied alone at the pleura. this finding can be interpreted considering the growth-promoting-activity that has been attributed to timp <dig>  <cit> . a wide range of human, bovine and mouse cells proliferate when incubated with timp <dig>  indeed, receptors of timp <dig> have been identified at the surface of the above cells  <cit> . one possible explanation is that timp <dig> acts on mesothelial cells via receptor-binding and influences mesothelial permeability, as is the case for numerous growth factors.

we next looked for a possible mechanism explaining the impact of mmps on the transmesothelial resistance and asked whether tj proteins, occludin and claudin- <dig>  may be hydrolyzed by mmps. tjs are a specific type of cell-cell contact which are located in the most apical region of the lateral plasma membrane. the paracellular passage of small molecules, such as water and solutes, is highly regulated by the tj proteins, including occludin and claudin- <dig>  <cit> . indirect immunofluorescence experiments for occludin and claudin- <dig> showed a continuous staining at cell periphery which was not weakened and remained at the cell borders after incubation with mmps. similarly, western blot revealed that these proteins are expressed at pleural mesothelium under normal conditions and are not proteolytically disrupted by mmps. more specifically for occludin, western blot analysis revealed three distinct bands: at  <dig> kda,  <dig> kda and a broad band at about >  <dig> kda. these bands may be due to occurrence of splice variants or post-transational modification, i.e phosphorylation. previous studies have shown that occludin is widely phosphorylated on serine and threonine resides and modulation of occludin phosphorylation regulates cellular localization and paracellular permeability  <cit> . some degree of phosphorylation may also be the case in the present study. as far as the  <dig> kda band is concerned, we cannot rule out the possibility that this band corresponds to a protein complex between occludin and claudin . occludin and claudin do not interact directly to each other, but they crosslink by integral tj proteins, such as zo- <dig>  zo- <dig> and zo- <dig>  <cit> . the intensity of the above band increased after mmps incubation, implying that mmps interfere with occludin and claudin interactions. because the  <dig> kda band appeared enhanced to all three western blot experiments that were performed, it is less likely to represent an artifact. the mesothelial cells used for immunofluorescence and western blotting derived from upper-, middle- and lower-heighted visceral pleura and no difference between them occurred.

our data is contradictory to previous results which have revealed mmps as major contributors to the control of paracellular permeability by proteolytic degradation of tj proteins. more specifically, mmps have been correlated with an increase in capillary permeability that follows ischemia-reperfusion injury in brain  <cit> , in myocardium  <cit> , in lung  <cit>  and in kidney  <cit> . these studies attributed to mmps an elementary role in the inflammatory process and the breakdown of the paracellular capillary permeability during inflammation. in some studies a selective cleavage of tj proteins occurred  <cit>  but the results of our study clearly showed that tj integrity is not disrupted at mesothelial cells by mmps. it is possible that other substrates, different from occludin and claudin- <dig>  are a molecular target for mmps at pleural mesothelium. for example, mmps have been found to disrupt or reorganize the basement membrane of endothelial cells and thus result to increased permeability  <cit> . moreover, adherent junctions are also degraded by mmps and their hydrolysis leads to tj disassembly and to increased permeability  <cit> .

the limitations of the present study are the followings: firstly, the ussing chamber technique investigates permeability alterations provoked on mesothelial membrane, which consists a confluent membrane between the apical and basolateral compartment of a chamber. however, under in vivo conditions it is possible that mmps act not only on mesothelial cells but also on vascular capillaries lying beneath the basement membrane. secondly, the precise role of the mesothelial layer at pleural fluid turnover is not fully established. although we used to believe that mesothelial cells are leaky and display no resistance at pleural fluid passage, more recent investigations indicate that the permeability to solutes of mesothelium is of the same order of magnitude as that of the capillary endothelium  <cit> . this means that pleural fluid is a filtrate of pleural capillaries and mesothelium too. moreover, damage of pleural mesothelial monolayer by lipopolysaccharide , thrombin and bacteria increase pleural permeability to proteins and demonstrate to play a central role in the formation of effusions  <cit> . finally, sheep pleura resembles to human pleura as far as morphology and function is concerned. on both pleurae the blood supply comes from the systemic circulation and microscopically two different types of mesothelial cells are found: the cyboidal cells with less developed tjs and flattened cells with more tjs  <cit> . however, further studies should be performed at human pleura in order to confirm the results of the present study.

our findings imply an important role for mmps in the pathogenesis of pleural effusions. under normal conditions, mmps and especially mmp <dig> are found only in small amounts in the pleural fluid. the balance of mmps in pleural fluid may serve the degradation and turnover of ecm that underlies mesothelial cells and which normally occurs in low rates. however in pleural exudates mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> levels increase, as shown from previous studies, and a role for mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> in pleural fluid formation is proposed by our study. tight junctions do not apparently loosen in mesothelial cells after the addition of mmps. it is possible that other mechanisms exist through which mmps increase mesothelial permeability. the revelation of the mechanims by which mmps compromise the mesothelial barrier will provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of pleural fluid formation.
