BACKGROUND
ghrelin is a  <dig> amino acid peptide hormone originally isolated from the stomach  and it is the endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor   <cit> . it is well established that ghrelin is a multifunctional peptide with roles in growth hormone release, appetite regulation and gut motility  <cit>  and we have demonstrated that it plays a role in cancer cell proliferation  <cit> . despite its widespread and important physiological actions, its precise regulatory mechanisms remain ambiguous. compared to other preprohormones, the genomic structure of ghrelin is thought to be relatively simple, consisting of four coding exons and a short,  <dig> bp first exon  <cit> , hereafter termed exon  <dig>  the ghrelin gene  spans  <dig> kb on chromosome  <dig>  <cit>  and exons  <dig> to  <dig> encode an  <dig> amino acid preprohormone, preproghrelin. the preproghrelin signal peptide is encoded in exon  <dig>  and the coding sequence of the  <dig> amino acid ghrelin peptide hormone is encoded by parts of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  exon  <dig> codes for obestatin, a recently identified  <dig> amino acid ghrelin gene-derived peptide hormone  <cit> . the physiological relevance of obestatin is somewhat controversial, as it does not circulate in human serum, although the c terminal peptide of ghrelin, c-ghrelin does  <cit> . c-ghrelin, encoded by exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  is a  <dig> amino acid peptide that contains the  <dig> amino acid obestatin peptide within its sequence  <cit> . it is currently not known if obestatin is cleaved from the large preproghrelin peptide, or whether distinct human obestatin-only and c-ghrelin-only transcripts exist. we have previously reported an obestatin-deleted transcript  <cit> . interestingly, a murine intron  <dig> retained variant lacking exon  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> has recently been reported  <cit> . the transcript therefore lacks the coding sequence of obestatin, but contains a putative peptide containing the first five amino acids of ghrelin and a novel  <dig> amino acid sequence.

re-examination of the ghrelin locus is required for a number of reasons. first, the ghrelin gene structure has not been examined since the finalisation of the human chromosome  <dig> sequence in  <dig>  <cit>  and the release of orthologous sequencing data. second, newly developed bioinformatic tools now enable comparative genomics analyses. the aim of this study was, therefore, to re-examine the organisation of the human ghrelin gene with the aid of recently available genomic sequence information from multiple species, including the continuously updated draft mouse  <cit>  and chicken  <cit>  genomes. using in silico approaches we predicted the existence of a novel, distal ghrelin exon  and this was confirmed experimentally using 5' race and rt-pcr. we have also identified the expression of extended exon  <dig> species and re-annotated a 5' extended exon  <dig> not previously recognised in the literature  <cit> . multiple alternative mrna transcripts were also identified experimentally from normal tissues and from prostate cell lines and a chondrosarcoma cell line, indicating that the ghrelin gene has a complex transcriptional pattern. in addition, we report a gene on the antisense strand of the ghrelin gene, ghrelinos , and have demonstrated the expression of endogenous natural antisense transcripts  that partially overlap the recognised sense ghrelin gene exons.

RESULTS
conserved regions identified using comparative genomic analysis of the ghrelin gene are transcribed
mulan analysis of the human and mouse ghrelin loci revealed the presence of two conserved regions  . neither of these upstream regions was conserved in the draft chicken genome sequence, even when the alignment stringency was altered . the 3' terminal  <dig> bp of a ~ <dig> bp conserved region is equivalent to a short, non-coding exon  <dig> sequence  previously demonstrated in human  <cit>  and in murine  <cit>  ghrelin transcripts, suggesting the existence of transcripts with an exon  <dig> that is considerably larger than the previously reported  <dig> bp exon  <dig>  a second, distal ~ <dig> bp region approximately  <dig>  kb upstream from exon  <dig> is also conserved.

the conserved regions upstream of exon  <dig> are ghrelin exons
to examine whether the conserved regions identified using mulan were transcribed, pcrs from human stomach  <dig> primers) were performed with antisense primers in exon  <dig> of ghrelin and sense primers in the conserved regions. agarose gel electrophoresis of these pcrs showed that both of the conserved regions were transcribed  and their identity was confirmed by sequencing. the putative exon regions appeared to be mutually exclusive in the human stomach and the putative exon-intron junctions conform to the gt/ag rule. therefore, initial analysis indicated that the conserved regions are true exons and not artefacts. the two conserved regions have been termed exon - <dig>  and exon  <dig> . in addition to these two regions, a sequence immediately upstream of exon  <dig> of the human ghrelin gene is conserved in comparison to mouse sequence . this conserved sequence matches the first  <dig> base pairs of a  <dig> bp exon  <dig> sequence previously reported in mrnas isolated from human stomach and thyroid medullary carcinoma tt cells  <cit> . the previous study, however, did not annotate this sequence as a 5' extended exon  <dig> . we have, therefore, identified a novel, distal exon and 5' extensions to two previously reported exons .

exon  <dig> and - <dig> are novel first exons
to examine if the two novel, putative exon - <dig> and extended exon  <dig> regions were first exons, that is if transcription start site  were present, 5' race was performed. exon 0-specific reverse primers and a race-ready panel of anchored cdna libraries derived from  <dig> human tissues  were used. sequencing of the 5' race clones from two replicate, independent experiments identified two exon - <dig> start sites, as well as multiple transcription start sites in exon  <dig> . the cdna sequences of the 5' race  products are shown in fig.  <dig>  the longest 5' race clone identified  is expressed in adipose tissue, leukocytes and the uterus  and contains a  <dig> base pair exon - <dig> and a large  <dig> bp exon  <dig> .

cap analysis of gene expression  tags average 20– <dig> nucleotides and are produced by large-scale sequencing of concatemers derived from the 5' ends of capped mrna  <cit> . the cage method, therefore, detects the most 5' site of the mrna transcripts – the transcription start site. even singly, cage tags are considered to be reliable markers of transcription start site  locations  <cit> . intriguingly, a human cage tag starting site  corresponding exactly to a  <dig> bp exon - <dig> transcription start site , was found via the cage basic viewer. furthermore, a  <dig> bp exon - <dig>  containing transcript was amplified by 5' race from adipose tissue , leukocytes and the spleen. sequence analysis demonstrates that it splices into a  <dig> base pair exon  <dig> . thus, the  <dig> bp conserved region, identified using mulan and confirmed experimentally, harbours an exon - <dig> with two transcription start sites.

several transcripts initiating in the 5' extended exon  <dig> were obtained in many of the tissues examined  including normal human testis, stomach, adipose tissue, leukocytes and ovary . while it is possible that the transcription start sites identified in exon  <dig> via 5' race represent truncated cdna, the sites are likely to be genuine, as we found multiple cage tag starting sites in the putative, extended exon  <dig> of mouse ghrelin . while the transcription start site of the short  <dig> bp human exon  <dig> aligns with the murine start site, the tsss of the human extended exon  <dig> and the putative extended murine exon  <dig> are quite different . this suggests that these exons have diverged significantly over time, resulting in considerable variation in their start sites, termed tss turnover  <cit> . tss turnover, with the translocation of mouse start sites compared to human start sites, occurs in a number of genes  <cit> .

recent studies indicate that many genes have broad transcriptional regulation with a wide distribution of proximal start sites, and not all genes are regulated by distinct start sites controlled by a tata box  <cit> . while a putative tata box flanks the originally described  <dig> bp exon  <dig>  it appears to be a very weak start site  <cit> . the cluster of transcription start sites  in the extended exon  <dig> sequence upstream of the short  <dig> bp exon  <dig>  contains no apparent tata boxes . our study indicates that the ghrelin gene is broadly regulated and has many potential transcription start sites. this may allow the transcription of numerous tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific transcripts. using in silico analysis coupled with rt-pcr and 5' race analysis, we have demonstrated that the conserved regions upstream of exon  <dig>  are transcribed and correspond to novel first exons of the human ghrelin gene.

multiple transcripts arise from alternative splicing from exons upstream of exon 1
expression of exon -1-containing and extended exon 0-containing transcripts were examined using rt-pcr with exon-specific sense primers  and with an antisense primer in the 3' terminal exon  <dig> of the ghrelin gene. a list of exons and exon-intron boundaries of ghrelin locus derived-transcripts identified in this and previous studies, as well as ests, is given in .

using sense primers in exon  <dig>  a  <dig> bp product that spanned exons  <dig> to  <dig> and contained a  <dig> bp exon  <dig>  was found in the human stomach . moreover, primer walking with sense primers further downstream in exon  <dig> always resulted in bands corresponding to exon  <dig> and  <dig> . several pcr products were amplified from the sw <dig> chondrosarcoma cell line . the difference in the sizes of the transcripts results from multiple non-canonical introns in exon  <dig> , and are most likely due to promiscuous splicing in the continuous tumour cell line.

we then examined the alternative splicing of transcripts expressing exon - <dig>  in human tissues and a range of human continuous cell lines. rt-pcr using sense primers to exon - <dig> revealed multiple transcripts in the normal human stomach  and several other tissues and cell lines . the transcripts were classified into three groups based on their sequences. the amplicons sequenced from the human stomach are depicted in fig. 4b, while fig.  <dig> summaries all exon - <dig> to  <dig> amplicons obtained in this study. the first two groups have exon structures that obey the gt/ag rule, while transcripts in the third group harbour canonical gt/ag intron splice sites in the antisense direction only.

in the first group , all amplicons include exon  <dig> to  <dig> which code for preproghrelin, and vary only in the length of the sequence upstream of exon  <dig> . the amplicons obtained from the human stomach  are depicted in fig. 4b. the  <dig> bp amplicon, demonstrated in the human stomach, was also observed in all cell lines examined , as well as in the heart, brain, spleen, testis, salivary gland, leukocytes and bone marrow . as depicted in fig.  <dig>  sequencing of the rapid-scan human tissue cdna panel also revealed a  <dig> bp amplicon with a  <dig> bp exon 0b in the placenta . furthermore, splice variants with an alternative exon  <dig> splice site , which results in loss of a glutamine residue at position  <dig> of the mature ghrelin peptide   <cit> , were also sequenced and correspond to a  <dig> bp  amplicon from the kidney and a  <dig> amplicon from heart tissue  . interestingly, a  <dig> bp amplicon with a  <dig> bp exon 0h initiating at the start of the  <dig> bp exon  <dig>  followed by the  <dig> bp exon 0d , was found in the kidney . a single nucleotide polymorphism  g.-1062g > c   is present in base  <dig> of the  <dig> bp exon  <dig> , creating a 3' splice-site consensus sequence   <cit> . this polymorphism has recently been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome in the korean population and is thought to influence the ghrelin promoter, ultimately increasing preproghrelin transcription efficiency  <cit> . our findings raise the possibility that this snp effects mrna splicing, resulting in allele-specific transcription of a  <dig> bp  or a  <dig> bp exon  <dig> .

the large, extended  <dig> bp exon  <dig> is extensively spliced and contains numerous non-conserved uorfs , while exon - <dig> contains a single translation start site in the human sequence only . approximately 12% of human genes are alternatively spliced within their 5' untranslated regions  <cit> . upstream open reading frames, as well as mrna secondary structure and other motifs in 5' utrs are known to regulate the translation of downstream major orfs and particularly those which translate developmental genes  <cit> . we suggest that the alternative transcripts identified which splice into exon  <dig> may be a part of such a regulatory mechanism. the  <dig> bp exon  <dig> found in human stomach and thyroid medullary carcinoma tt cells  <cit>  is devoid of upstream open reading frames and stable secondary structure . as a consequence, this transcript may be more efficiently translated than the group i transcripts with exon - <dig> and extended exon  <dig> which have more extensive 5' untranslated regions.

the second group  of transcripts contains splice variants which include exon - <dig> in various combinations with exons downstream of exon  <dig> . in addition to the two  <dig> and  <dig> bp amplicons cloned from the human stomach  , we obtained a  <dig> base pair amplicon  in the pc <dig> human prostate carcinoma cell line corresponding to a transcript that lacks exons 0– <dig>  but contains exon - <dig> and exon  <dig>  flanked by gt/ag splice junctions . furthermore, the  <dig> bp amplicon from the human stomach was also sequenced from the heart and spleen  and amplicons at the expected size were observed in leukocyte and bone marrow . moreover, sequencing of leukocyte-derived amplicons demonstrated an mrna variant with a previously described  <dig> base pair 5' truncated exon  <dig>  <cit> , exon 2b  . given that exon  <dig> is skipped in all group ii variants, preproghrelin and the n-terminal 'active core' -phe) of the ghrelin hormone  <cit>  cannot be translated from them. interestingly, analysis of these variants using signalp v <dig>   <cit>  predicts a signal peptide  in exon - <dig> . indeed, if the signal peptide is translated, the putative peptides would be in-frame with previously reported ghrelin gene derived peptides . the putative peptides encoded by these transcripts would include the sequence for c-ghrelin  , the hormone obestatin alone   <cit> , and also a novel c-terminal proghrelin peptide   that is upregulated in prostate  <cit>  and breast  <cit>  cancer. the identification of several mrna variants with coding sequence in-frame with an exon - <dig> encoded putative signal peptide strongly suggests that the signal peptide is translated and functional. for example, we have demonstrated the expression a c-ghrelin mrna variant in human heart tissue. c-ghrelin circulates at high levels in patients with heart failure and at low levels in patients with myocardial infarction, and do not correspond with ghrelin levels  <cit> . in rat plasma and rat tissues, c-ghrelin levels do not appear to correspond directly with ghrelin levels  <cit> . therefore, the regulation of preproghrelin and c-ghrelin could be independent and c-ghrelin could be a ghrelin gene derived hormone with distinct functions. interestingly, a murine testis specific transcript, the ghrelin-gene derived transcript or ggdt, that codes for obestatin but not ghrelin, has previously been demonstrated and harbours a putative nuclear localisation signal  <cit> . while the functions of obestatin remain somewhat controversial  <cit> , it may play a role in sleep  <cit> , anxiety  <cit>  and in cell proliferation  <cit> .

natural antisense transcripts are transcribed from a gene on the opposite strand of ghrelin 
the third  group of alternative transcripts containing exon - <dig> and  <dig> that we identified in the human stomach  result from splicing of transcripts with exon - <dig> sequences of ~ <dig> bp, termed exon -1*a, and ~ <dig> bp, termed exon -1*b. these exons extend into intron - <dig> and are considerably larger than the  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp exon - <dig> sequences obtained in this study. moreover, these splice variants also contain two novel intron 2-derived exons  and an alternative exon  <dig>  . as is the case in the stomach, the fragments corresponding to these unusual transcripts were observed in all cell lines examined . the  <dig> bp amplicon expressed in the stomach is also expressed in the heart and fetal liver . furthermore, an mrna variant with a ~ <dig> bp exon -1*a and exon 2*, but lacking exon 2**  was sequenced from the spleen , while a  <dig> bp amplicon  harbouring exon -1*a and exon 4* only was obtained from the kidney . we then determined the direction of transcription of these transcripts. gmap  <cit>  and manual analyses were performed using sequenced pcr products obtained in this study, as well as expressed sequence tags  spanning at least one intron. this analysis showed that while there are no canonical gt/ag splice junctions if the variants are transcribed from the sense  dna strand, the reverse strand contains gt/ag intron junctions. all exons demonstrated this pattern with the exception of the intron flanking exon 2* of these fragments and -1*a/b, where the splice junction is gc/ag. gc/ag is relatively rare, but the most common non-canonical splice site pair  <cit> .

to confirm the direction of transcription of the putative antisense transcripts, we employed strand-specific primers in reverse transcription  reactions to specifically target either sense or antisense transcripts. rt-pcr analysis of human stomach cdna  revealed that the target transcripts are transcribed in the antisense direction . furthermore, southern hybridisation, employing a nested dig-labelled pcr probe, demonstrated a very strong signal for the antisense-direction amplicon . the expected  <dig> base pair amplicon  was isolated and sequenced to confirm its identity . we have termed this antisense gene ghrelinos .

in order to firmly establish the origin of the antisense ghrelinos mrna transcripts, and to determine how far they extend relative to the ghrelin gene, 5' rlm-race using human stomach cdna was performed. sequencing of race products identified two transcription start sites  corresponding to a  <dig> bp and an  <dig> bp exon 4* . furthermore, a cage tag starting site was identified  in the antisense direction corresponding to a  <dig> base pair exon 4*. the three tsss of ghrelinos transcripts are summarised in fig. 7b. we did not identify any potential tata-boxes, therefore, these findings suggest that exon 4* contains multiple tsss, which is typical of tata-less promoters  <cit> .

sequence analysis demonstrates that the ghrelinos gene undergoes substantial alternative splicing, and we have identified five natural antisense transcripts . the transcripts differ in the length of exon -1* , while in the third transcript  exon 2* is extended and exon 2** is absent. ghrelinos <dig> lacks exon 2** and harbours the canonical exon 2*. finally, ghrelinos <dig> lacks both exon 2* and 2**. the exon-intron junctions of ghrelinos transcripts are depicted in fig. 8b. the analysis revealed no significant sequence similarity to any known gene, protein or to any long orfs , suggesting that these transcripts may function as regulatory, non-coding rna  <cit> . natural antisense transcripts  that are transcribed from the opposite strands of the same genomic locus are termed cis-nats  <cit> .

the ghrelin nats that we have described span the non-coding 3' utr region of exon  <dig> and exon - <dig> of mature, sense ghrelin gene-derived transcripts and overlap intron  <dig> sequence of ghrelin pre-mrnas . sense exons - <dig> and  <dig> are conserved when compared to mouse genomic sequence, while the degree of sequence similarity to exon -1* , exon 2* and exon 2** appears to be very low . interestingly, most previously reported cis-nats overlap with the sense transcript in their untranslated regions  <cit> . this appears to be the case for ghrelinos transcript as exon - <dig> and  <dig> corresponds to 5' and 3' utrs of sense ghrelin transcripts encoding preproghrelin.

it has been demonstrated that the mammalian genome is often transcribed from both the sense and antisense dna strands  <cit> . although the understanding of the mechanisms of action of natural antisense transcripts remains in its infancy, these transcripts have been shown to be involved in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. nats have been associated with a range of regulatory mechanisms, including transcriptional interference, rna masking and dsrna mediated gene-silencing via direct interaction between the sense and antisense transcripts  <cit> . intriguingly, in a very recent study, rats were administered a short,  <dig> base pair ghrelin antisense oligonucleotide into the cerebrospinal fluid  <cit> . the antisense oligonucleotide is complementary to sequence in the rat preproghrelin 3' utr in exon  <dig> . the study found that the antisense oligonucleotide decreased anxiety in rats  and may act as an antidepressant  <cit> . we suggest that this preliminary evidence may provide a first glimpse of the function of endogenous ghrelin natural antisense transcripts.

it has been reported that ghrelin mrna and protein levels are dissociated  <cit> . we hypothesise that this may be due to either the presence of upstream open reading frames in exons 5' to exon  <dig> ; expression of ghrelin locus derived transcripts lacking coding potential for ghrelin; or non-coding sense and/or antisense regulatory transcripts. the transcripts identified in this study may be examples of at least one of these factors. therefore the physiological significance of each transcript species, in particular mrna variants encoding preproghrelin, cannot be determined based on mrna expression data alone.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we have shown that two newly identified exon regions of the ghrelin gene have the potential to generate a broad and complex transcriptional repertoire. furthermore, a gene on the antisense strand of ghrelin, ghrelinos, generates antisense transcripts that overlap conventional, sense ghrelin gene-derived transcripts. it would now seem imperative to perform a large-scale, thorough re-examination of the ghrelin locus in order to identify and characterise novel transcripts and peptides, as well as their function in various physiological and pathophysiological states, including obesity, depression and cancer. such efforts may result in a reconceptualisation of the regulation and mechanisms of action of the multifunctional ghrelin peptide.
