BACKGROUND
sharing the characteristics of a classical avian karyotype, the chicken genome, as standardized by ladjali-mohammedi et al in  <dig>  <cit> , is composed of  <dig> macrochromosomes including the z and w sex chromosomes and  <dig> pairs of microchromosomes. these very small chromosomes range in size between  <dig>  and  <dig> mb  <cit>  and are remarkably gene rich  <cit> . the draft sequence assembly, comprising the macrochromosomes and the largest microchromosomes, has an overall high quality, apart for numerous gaps and minor local rearrangements  <cit> . however, despite international efforts towards a complete sequence,  <dig> microchromosomes still remain absent from the current assembly. this can be caused by several factors, such as the difficulty to identify them by cytogenetic approaches or/and problems for cloning and sequencing these -rich dna fragments  <cit> . the contigs which could not be assigned to a chromosome are arranged in a virtual chromosome  and we have previously demonstrated that some of these sequences could be assigned to small microchromosomes  <cit> . moreover, we have also shown that many chicken cdna and est  sequence contigs are absent from the assembly, including in the chrun fraction, suggesting the total absence of large amounts of the corresponding genomic dna  <cit> .

gga <dig> is the chromosome bearing the nor  and illustrates perfectly the sequencing and mapping problems encountered for avian microchromosomes. its sequence is far from being complete, with only  <dig> kb of sequence presented in the current assembly whereas its estimated physical size is between  <dig> and  <dig> mb  <cit> . even when taking the rrna genes that cover around  <dig> mb and represent  <dig> to 70% of the chromosome into account  <cit> , a large proportion of gga <dig> remains to be sequenced.

interestingly, the chicken mhc , the role of which is central in the immune response, has also been mapped to gga <dig>  it is composed of two loci, named the b and y complexes  <cit> . the b complex was first identified as a polymorphic blood group system in chicken  <cit> , leading to the first method to identify mhc genotypes by serology. later, the locus was associated with graft rejection  <cit>  and with genetic control of the immune response  <cit> , i.e. classical functions of mhc locus in vertebrates. the b region has been strongly associated with resistance to infectious diseases such as marek's disease  <cit> .

the first mapping of the b complex was conducted by bloom and bacon  <cit>  who assigned it to a single microchromosome pair together with the nor. dominguez-steglich and her co-authors  <cit>  confirmed this result using non-isotopic in situ hybridization. the y complex was discovered later and determined as genetically independent  <cit> . despite this independence, the two complexes are located together on the same microchromosome, referenced as the pair number  <dig>  <cit> . the gga <dig> genetic linkage group contains only a few microsatellite markers, organised in two independent groups which are separated by  <dig> cm  <cit> . curiously, the recent high-density snp-based linkage map has no snp on gga <dig>  <cit> . finally, no radiation hybrid map was constructed for this microchromosome  <cit> . by comparison with the canonical organization of vertebrate mhc, the annotation of the chicken mhc-b region shows that only the main small class i and class ii core sub-regions are represented in the genome assembly. the extended class i and class iii sub-regions are only very partially represented  <cit> , and many genes usually present in mammalian mhc seem absent. therefore, despite many attempts at sequencing gga <dig> by whole genome or chromosome-specific mapping and sequencing approaches, including very early contig maps built with cosmid clones  <cit> , this chromosome still remains badly covered. amongst other consequences, this prevents from performing proper quantitative trait loci  detection in a region which is important for the immune response.

due to the difficulties encountered in obtaining information on the very specific organization of gga <dig> by the sequencing and/or physical bac chromosome walking strategies, we decided to undertake an integrated approach focussed specifically on this microchromosome. recently, the order of the nor, mhc-y and mhc-b complexes was defined by fish mapping on mitotic prometaphase and meiotic prophase i pachytene chromosomes  <cit> . to confirm this organization and build precise genomic markers maps, we integrated three alternative mapping strategies, namely radiation hybrid  mapping, genetic mapping, and high resolution fish mapping on giant lampbrush chromosomes from growing oocytes, allowing the estimation of recombination rates along the chromosome.

RESULTS
development of gga <dig> markers
seventy five rh markers were developed. these were identified as putatively belonging to gga <dig> based on several sources of information, including similarity with other b and y complex gene sequence and synteny conservation with human. out of all these potential markers,  <dig> could finally not be assigned to gga <dig> after rh mapping .

- available gga <dig> sequences
a total of  <dig>  bp are available for gga <dig> in the whole genome assembly  <cit> . additional  <dig>  bp are designed as "chr16_random", corresponding to contigs assigned to gga <dig> without information on their relative positions. thirty eight primer pairs were designed from these sequences:  <dig> from gga <dig> and  <dig> from gga16_random . in the chicken genome assembly wugs c <dig> /galgal <dig>  the nor region is located in chicken chromosome  <dig>  <cit> ; we designed primers in this region to map nor markers, as they are known to be localized on gga <dig> 

- comparative mapping
sequence similarities were observed between gga <dig> and human chromosome region 6p <dig> , or with other human chromosomes   <cit> , and therefore chicken chrun or est sequence aligning by sequence similarity to these human regions are a potential source of supplementary markers. by this approach, we obtained putative non-mhc and non-nor gga <dig> markers that should allow linking the three b, y and rrna genes loci together. interestingly,  <dig> of the chicken est thus identified presented no similarity with the chicken genome assembly , suggesting they were left out in the whole genome sequencing process and could thus be part of the missing gga <dig> sequences. eighteen markers were developed and mapped on gga <dig> through this strategy .

- bac screening
twelve markers, well distributed along the rh map described below, were chosen to screen the wageningen bac library  <cit> . screening was performed by two-dimensional pcr on dna pools  <cit> . five positive bacs were selected: one for the nor complex , one for the y complex , and three for the b complex . the bac ends were sequenced to develop two supplementary markers .

the sixth bac clone , known to contain a gga <dig> fragment  <cit> , was obtained from the bac pac resource center .

- identification of the complex of origin for each marker
in a first step, the localization of most of the markers was obtained through previous knowledge - the locations of microsatellites lei <dig>  mcw <dig>  mcw <dig> and mcw <dig> from the b complex were known before we started our work  <cit>  - or in-silico sequence analysis: sequences from all the markers developed were compared to the ncbi databases by blast . this allowed assigning  <dig> fragments to one of the three complexes, thanks to the identification as "18s", "28s", "mhc-b" or "rfp-y" fragments .

marker 523b <dig> was assigned to the y complex because it was developed from a bac-end sequence obtained from a clone containing marker seq <dig>  a fragment from the y complex .

in a second step, the assignation of the remaining markers was deduced from their position, relative to known markers, on the rh and/or genetic map.

radiation hybrid map
altogether,  <dig> primer pairs enabled successful amplification and the subsequent mapping of the corresponding fragments:  <dig> mapped to gga <dig>   <dig> to other chromosomes and  <dig> remained unlinked. the total number of markers assigned to gga <dig> rose to  <dig> with the addition of  <dig> public snp rh genotypes obtained from the cng .

after multipoint analysis, the framework map was composed of  <dig> markers and covers a length of  <dig>  cr. the remaining  <dig> markers were integrated at their best possible locations to build a comprehensive map .

the retention frequency values of the markers along the chromosome were plotted, in order to evaluate the position of the centromere, which usually has a higher retention frequency  <cit> .

genetic map
in order to integrate markers mapped elsewhere,  <dig> populations were used: our experimental one, the east lansing backcross one and the compton backcross one . a total of  <dig> new informative markers could be added to the gga <dig> consensus linkage map  <cit> , eight of which genotyped on our experimental population. together with the previously available data, the gga <dig> genetic map is now composed of  <dig> markers and is  <dig>  cm long .

cytogenetic map
- fish on metaphase chromosomes and interphase nuclei
six bac clones from gga <dig>  were mapped two by two on chicken metaphase chromosomes and interphase nuclei . these experiments suggest the b complex is in q-terminal position, whereas the nor is located at the proximal region of the q arm of gga <dig>  as already observed, the fish signals for the b, y and nor complexes on condensed mitotic metaphase chromosomes were too close to allow defining their order unequivocally. intriguingly, wag523b <dig>  a clone from the y complex, gave several hybridization signals on interphase nuclei, which might correspond to clusters of repeated sequences dispersed on gga <dig> .

the "markers" column indicates which marker has been used to screen the wageningen bac library .

-fish on lampbrush chromosome  <dig> 
to define gene order in gga <dig> more precisely we hybridized bac-probes specific for the b complex , the y complex  and the nor  to chicken lampbrush chromosomes  , which allow for higher resolution mapping .

gga <dig> in the lampbrush form  contains  <dig> chromomeres and has always one chiasma, indicating the position of the meiotic recombination site. previous studies using immunostaining for cohesin, showed that centromeres on lampbrush microchromosomes, including lbc <dig>  are located at terminal dapi-positive chromomeres consisting of cnm repeat   <cit> . on lbc <dig> the centromere is situated between two small but prominent terminal chromomeres . the nor complex adjoins these pericentromeric chromomeres and comprises the next two chromomeres. bac-clones specific for the y complex hybridize to one chromomere next to the nor-positive ones. the b complex occupies the distal chromomere .

it is worth noting that fish with nor-specific probes never produces signals on lateral loops undergoing transcription, but dots in condensed chromomeres. this observation suggests that ribosomal rna genes are not transcribed at the lampbrush stage, which is consistent with previous data on chicken oocytes . along with the chromomere occupied by the y complex, the nor-bearing chromomeres form a short "loop-less" region that makes lbc <dig> easily distinguishable from any other micro-lbcs. in contrast to the rrna genes, at least some of the mhc genes seem to be transcribed in lbcs, especially,the mhc-b region probes do hybridize to rna transcripts on lateral loops .

the b and y complexes on lbc <dig> are separated by two chromomeres. these two chromomeres did not hybridize with any of the probes specific to one of the three complexes. previous detailed analysis of the distribution of cnm and po <dig>  <dig> bp repeats using fish on chicken lbcs  <cit> , showed that the microchromosome we describe here had strong interstitial fish signals for the po <dig> repeat, which are typically subtelomeric. to determine whether the two chromomeres between the b and y complexes are composed of repeated sequences, we performed fish with oligo probes specific to po <dig> and cnm repeats followed by fish with gga <dig> specific bac probes. these experiments clearly showed that the b and y complexes are separated by long arrays of po <dig> tandem repeat. what is also very special of these po41-positive chromomeres is that the chiasma observed on lbc <dig> is invariably associated with one of these two chromomeres, .

discussion
chicken nor-bearing chromosome gga <dig> was originally identified as microchromosome  <dig> using classical silver staining techniques  <cit>  and re-numbered later as chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . due to technical issues the size of this chromosome was overestimated and its real length is much smaller than chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . past estimations of the total amount of dna for this chromosome were between  <dig> and  <dig> mb  <cit> . we have here new estimations for the size of gga <dig>  the first is deduced from the counting of chromomeres: the average amount of dna per chromomere in an avian lampbrush microchromosome is between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb  <cit>  and we identified  <dig> chromomeres in chicken lbc <dig> , resulting in a size estimation between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb. the second is deduced from our rh map: when mapping the other chicken chromosomes with the chickrh <dig> panel, we found an average value of  <dig>  kb/cr  <cit> , our gga <dig> rh map is  <dig> cr , which suggests a coverage of  <dig>  mb. therefore, the two size estimations agree together and with the most recently published one  <cit> , and they suggest our rh map covers gga <dig> almost entirely. we confirm therefore that approximately 95% of the gga <dig> sequence is missing from the current genome assembly.

three major gene complexes were assigned so far to gga16: the nor, mhc-b and mhc-y. the fact that the nor and mhc-b are linked on one microchromosome was discovered  <dig> years ago  <cit>  and the assignment of mhc-y more recently  <cit> .

the chicken mhc shows strong similarities with mammalian mhc with the presence of genes from class i, ii, and iii and extended class i regions, but its organization is very different, principally due to the existence of the two genetically independent complexes mhc-b and mhc-y. the chicken mhc-b complex contains, among other genes, two genes homologous to classical mammalian class i genes: b-f <dig> and b-f <dig>  and two genes homologous to classical mammalian class ii genes: b-l <dig> and b-l <dig>  <cit> . it was proposed that the central region of the b complex could be considered as minimal and essential, as the limited number of class i and class ii genes are found in tight linkage with other genes having functions in the immune response  <cit> . the mhc-y complex - initially named rfp-y  - was discovered later, and was defined as a polymorphic locus "mhc like"  <cit> . this second mhc region also contains expressed class i and class ii genes  <cit> . the independent genetic assortment of the two complexes has been known for years  <cit> , first suggesting they were located on two different chromosomes. however, fish mapping on chicken chromosomes clearly showed that these two loci both map to gga <dig> at a short physical distance, given the small size of this chromosomes  <cit> .

for long, the order of the three loci along gga <dig> was difficult to resolve as genetic maps were composed of two independent groups, as exemplified by our data  and fish mapping to mitotic microchromosomes gave signals too close to one another for determining an order . the most commonly admitted model was that the nor region should be situated between the two mhc complexes which were situated at the two extremities of the chromosome. in this model, the nor was thought to act as a spacer allowing for meiotic recombination events to take place  <cit> .

our detailed rh map and high-resolution fish mapping results on giant lamprush chromosomes from chicken oocytes clearly demonstrate a different order for the three complexe: centromere - nor - y - b . the orientation with respect to centromere is obvious both from fish data in which the centromere is visible and from rh mapping data. for the latter, the position of the centromere on the map is deduced from the retention frequency values along the chromosome, which are usually higher near the centromere  <cit>  . the same gene order was recently shown by delany and her colleagues , based on cytogenetic observations on elongated mitotic and meiotic chromosomes  <cit> . thus, with no doubts we can say now that the elusive order of the nor, y and b complexes in gga <dig> has been established.

the genetic map was enriched by developing polymorphism for markers selected in the rh map and integrating them with markers from the consensus linkage map. the average cr/cm ratio is about  <dig> when calculated over the whole map length. this relatively low value, as compared to the  <dig> cr/cm obtained for gga <dig>  <cit>  or  <dig>  cr/cm for gga <dig>  <cit> , is influenced by the disparity in recombination rate observed along the chromosome and is a consequence of the systematic recombination event between the mhc-y and mhc-b complexes.

by high resolution mapping on lbc <dig> we showed that the segment between the mhc-b and mhc-y complexes contains many copies of the highly repeated  <dig> bp tandem repeat, po <dig>  until now, po <dig> sequences were found to concentrate in the subtelomeric regions of gga <dig>  gga <dig>  ggaz and ggaw  <cit>  and in the current chicken genome assembly, sequences homologous to po <dig> are only assigned to the virtual chromosome , probably due to difficulties with the repeats in the assembly process. gga <dig> is the first identified chicken microchromosome known to contain this repeat. po <dig> repeats are -rich  and their presence on gga <dig> fits the hypothesis of delany et al. <cit>  that a gc-rich region separates the mhc-y and mhc-b. this organization of the mhc complexes seems to be evolutionary conserved in birds, even if not yet demonstrated in passerines  <cit> . for instance, a gc-rich satellite mgasat <dig> as well as an ultra-long internal telomere array were found between genetically unlinked mhc-b and mhc-y loci in turkey  <cit> . the long arrays of tandem repeats between the two mhc complexes in birds can explain their independent genetic segregation. our data made us return to the idea of highly repeated sequences playing a major role in the formation of recombination hot spots. indeed, inverted-repeated sequences are known to induce dna double-strand breaks  during meiosis in yeast  <cit> , as the first step in a series of events associated with meiotic recombination. importantly, the same machinery responsible for normal recombination process is involved in palindrome-mediated dsb formation  <cit> . although the po <dig> repeated units themselves do not tend to form hairpins, they can be found in inverted orientation in the chicken genome sequence databases. moreover, the existence of short tracks of inverted copies was demonstrated for po <dig> using sense and antisense oligonucleotide fish probes applied to chicken lbcs  <cit> . thus, the inverted arrays of po <dig> repeats can be responsible for dsb generation and consequently a high frequency of recombination events between the mhc-y and mhc-b complexes in gga <dig>  moreover, the fact that po <dig> is intensely transcribed at the position of chiasma formation seems not to be accidental. the relationship between transcription and recombinations hot-spots is well-established .

as it is difficult to obtain the precise distribution and dimension of the po <dig> tracks, one can speculate about the degree of complexity of the region between two mhc clusters. for instance, part of it could be homologous to a recently cloned sequence from the zebrafinch germ-line restricted chromosome   <cit> .

it is not excluded that the region of interest can also be interspersed with coding sequences which remain unsequenced due to compositional reasons. if so, the  <dig> est found by examining sequences similar to gga <dig> in the human genome and having no similarity with the chicken genome assembly  could illustrate this case: they all map to the region between the two complexes, or near this portion of the map .

comparative mapping with the human genome using the est data reveals that in addition to the known and obvious hsa 6p <dig> region containing the human mhc , several other human chromosomes show limited homology or synteny conservation with gga <dig> . the hsa <dig> terminal region and the hsa <dig> short arm region, which were already suspected to have a region of conserved synteny with gga <dig> are confirmed here, both for a short genomic fragment. although our data confirm the assignment of these regions to gga <dig>  the issue as to whether these fragments showing sequence similarities really correspond to evolutionary orthologous fragments remains unresolved. a larger conservation of synteny fragments is confirmed with hsa <dig> and a new human chromosome is shown to share synteny fragments with gga16: hsa <dig>  the most gene-rich human chromosome. the region of sequence similarity stands at the end of the hsa <dig> q arm, known to be nearly absent from the actual chicken sequence and genetic map  <cit> . this human region was already known to share synteny conservation with microchromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  and chromosome  <dig>  <cit> .

the gga <dig> sequence coverage is still far from being complete but our addition of est improves the knowledge on this microchromosome. one could have expected a better sequence coverage with the release of a novel gallus gallus 12x  <dig> sequence assembly . but a blast analysis of these new contigs with the available sequence assembly reveals only a partial coverage of the gga <dig> sequences in this lastest sequence data source .

CONCLUSIONS
our data confirm and refine the gga <dig> chromosome organization, by using three integrated mapping strategies: rh mapping, genetic mapping and high resolution fish, especially on lampbrush chromosomes from growing oocytes which were shown here to provide a unique opportunity to study recombination hot spots and to analyse their molecular context. the markers developed here may be useful to improve the gga <dig> sequence assembly, and for qtl mapping studies, for which this chromosome is usually missing. the high-recombining region bearing a systematic chiasma separating the two mhc complexes is open for further detailed research.
