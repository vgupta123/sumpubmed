BACKGROUND
in terms of nutritional value and economic importance, apple , grape, orange and banana are globally the most predominant fruit crops. among these four fruit crops, apple is king. apple production relies heavily on grafting, a technique that combines well-adapted rootstocks with high-quality scions. various aspects of scion growth and development, such as plant height, fruiting rate, resistance, physiological and biochemical characteristics and environmental adaptability , are invariably influenced by the rootstock. grafting experiments have revealed that plant vascular systems function as transportation corridors for hormones, sugars and rna molecules . plant vascular systems including xylem and phloem tissues play crucial roles in the transportation of water, minerals and organics substances, and serve as the junction between aboveground and belowground tissues  <cit> . extensive research has demonstrated that grafted gain-of-function transcripts can impact tissue development, thereby influencing features such as leaf shape and root architecture .

the developmental plasticity of roots, which are mainly composed of lateral roots  and primary roots , is regulated by hormonal signals and nutrients . the relationship of cytokinins , brassinolide , abscisic acid , gibberellins , ethylene and strigolactones are related to auxin biosynthesis, transport, distribution and/or signalling is relatively clear . as nutrient components, the main targets of sugar signals are auxin, aba and ck signalling processes  <cit> .

auxin transport and signalling play essential roles in pr growth and lr formation . cks, which are antagonistic to auxin, repress pr growth and lr initiation by suppressing cell differentiation . this antagonism between auxin and cks in prs was mediated by short hypocotyl  <dig>   <cit> . arabidopsis response regulator  <dig> , which activates ck signaling, binds directly to the shy <dig> promoter region. in response to auxin, shy <dig> degradation is induced to enable auxin transport and distribution. during lr formation, signaling components including histidine kinases  and arrs are also involved in the inhibitory effect of ck  <cit> , which research has shown is unaffected by the addition of auxin  <cit> .

in roots, cell cycle and differentiation-related genes, such as cyca2; <dig>  cyca2; <dig>  cycb1; <dig>  cycd1; <dig>  cycd3; <dig> and cdkb2; <dig>  are activated by auxin . several root development-related genes identified from studies of root phenotypic mutants, are responsible for meristematic activity  <cit> . for instance, short root  is specifically expressed in root column vascular tissues to regulate root longitudinal growth  <cit> . even when treated with exogenous auxin, the aberrant lateral root formation- <dig>  only has normal prs but no lrs  <cit> .

in grafted apple seedlings, rootstock root architecture, resistance and root regeneration are affected by the scion  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood. with the availability of the apple complete genome sequence and the advance of next-generation high-throughput rna sequencing  technology, genome-wide transcriptome analysis can be applied to study gene expression patterns in different tissues under various conditions during apple root growth and development.

after grafting scions with consistent genetic backgrounds onto identical rootstock materials, we used rna-seq of roots to analyze gene expression patterns of development-related biological processes. a combined analysis of plant growth dynamics and hormone and sugar contents in roots indicated that scion characteristics can influence rootstock phenotypes, which were mainly regulated by auxin and ck signaling pathways. root activity and resistance were also influenced. these results may be helpful for further understanding of the mechanisms that cause grafting and internal conditions to influence root growth and development.

RESULTS
phenotypic changes in grafted seedlings
to quantify the effect of scions on rootstock phenotype, we grafted seedlings of wild type  m. spectabilis ‘bly114’ and its more-branching mutant  onto identical m. robusta rootstocks. scions of young plants displayed similar phenotypes, with obvious differences appearing at the branching stage  . pr length and diameter and root fresh weight were reduced in mb-bearing rootstock compared with wt-grafted material, whereas the number of lrs was slightly but not significantly higher . to assess the relative proportion of lr growth to total root growth, we used the ratio of lr number to total root weight. as shown in fig. 1g, this ratio was higher in mb-bearing rootstock. this ratio progressively decreased in both mb- and wt-bearing rootstocks as the growth period was extended. these results indicate that root growth, particularly the primary root, is the main process.fig.  <dig> phenotypic changes in wild-type  and more-branching  grafted apple  scions and m. robusta rootstock. a–b branching phenotypes of wt and mb grafted scions at different growth stages ; c–d root phenotypes at the branching stage . e–g comparison of branching number, root phenotypic parameters and root ratio. data are means ± se . root ratio was assessed by the relative proportion of lr number to total root weight. significant differences  are based on student’s t-test. scale bars =  <dig>  cm ,  <dig>  cm ,  <dig>  cm  and  <dig>  cm 



quantitative analysis of sugars, photosynthetic parameters and hormones
to evaluate nutrient levels, we measured levels of soluble sugars, including sucrose, glucose, fructose and sorbitol, in roots, stems and leaves at early growth and branching stages  . at the early growth stage , the only significant difference was that sorbitol levels were lower in stems of mb than in wt scions . at the branching stage, levels of all soluble sugars in the two scions were highest in mb leaves and lowest in mb stems , which indicates that sugars were concentrated in mb leaves with lower output. sorbitol content was relatively lower in roots of mb-bearing rootstock while fructose content was slightly higher . compared with wt scions, total soluble sugar content of stems and roots was lower in mb scions and that of leaves was higher.fig.  <dig> quantification of soluble sugars in wt and mb grafted apples. sugar content in leaves , stems  and roots  at the early growth stage  and the branching stage . values are means ± se . significant differences  are based on student’s t-tests



moreover, net photosynthetic efficiency  was higher in wt than mb leaves and was not balanced by the lower stomatal conductance  needed for equal intercellular co <dig> concentration  .

zeatin riboside , aba and indole acetic acid  contents were significantly higher in roots of mb-bearing rootstock, while gas contents were unchanged . the aba content of shoot tips, stems and roots of grafted mb was obviously higher than that of grafted wt, whereas iaa content was higher in stems and shoot tips, but not roots, of grafted wt . these data demonstrate that higher iaa and zr in roots of mb-bearing rootstock should be closely related to its root anatomy .fig.  <dig> quantification of free zr, iaa, gas and aba in wt and mb grafted apple. hormone content in shoot tips , stems  and roots  at the branching stage . values are means ± se . significant differences  are based on student’s t-tests



tissue sampling, rna-seq and analysis of differentially expressed genes
to gain global insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for the different phenotypes , root apex samples without lrs  <cit>  were collected from wt and mb for transcriptomic analysis at the branching stage. to ensure data reliability, two samples of each type of seedling were sequenced.

a statistical summary of rna-seq results is given in table  <dig>  the genomic mapping rate was greater than  <dig>  %, with the gene mapping rate reaching  <dig> - <dig>  %. identification of differentially expressed genes  was based on the criteria of false discovery rate  <  <dig> , |log2ratio| ≥  <dig>  and reads per kb per million mapped reads  ≥  <dig> at least in one sample. venn diagrams of all genes of different expression and degs in roots of wt- and mb-bearing rootstock are shown in fig.  <dig>  most expressed genes had obviously similar expression levels between the two scion types, suggesting that mb had only a narrow influence on the rootstock. among degs,  <dig> were down-regulated and  <dig> were up-regulated in root grafted mb.table  <dig> summary of rna sequencing data from roots of m. robusta rootstock grafted with wild-type  and more-branching  m. spectabilis scions

gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway enrichment analyses were used to respectively identify biological processes and biological functions enriched in degs. significantly enriched go biological terms included those in the categories of sugar and phosphate metabolic processes , response to stimulus and signaling , cellular activity  and specific development processes  . furthermore, down-regulated genes were obviously enriched to signal transduction, metabolic process and cellular activity . the most heavily enriched kegg pathways were related to hormone signal transduction, specific metabolic processes and biosynthesis . to evaluate cellular events, we compiled a list of degs with pathway annotations related to hormone signaling pathways and intracellular activity . in this list,  <dig>  % of genes, primarily falling into pathway categories of hormone signal transduction, rna polymerase, brassinosteroid biosynthesis, aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis, histidine metabolism and ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, were down-regulated.fig.  <dig> clusters of annotated go terms in the biological process category enriched in degs between roots of grafted wt and mb apple. degs were classified into specific biological process categories using david with high classification stringency . the horizontal ordinate represents the number of genes in the category



to validate the reliability of the expression profiles obtained from rna-seq, we selected sixteen degs for quantitative real-time pcr . notably, the expressed trends between q-pcr data and rna-seq data were consistent generally .

expression of sugar metabolism-related genes
sugar content and metabolism were correlated with the status of energy supply status at the branching stage. as shown in the list of sugar metabolism-related genes, most genes especially in the process of glycolysis were significantly repressed in roots of mb-bearing rootstock . sucrose and glucose contents were undifferentiated, however, while fructose content was a slightly elevated in roots of grafted mb .fig.  <dig> selected genes related to sugar metabolism from rna sequencing data. a a schematic diagram of sugar metabolism from starch and sucrose metabolism to tca cycle. bounding boxes represent metabolic processes or metabolite, and digit represents regulatory enzyme for specific process. straight arrow indicates transformational direction of metabolite . b selected genes related to starch, sucrose, fructose and sorbitol metabolism. c selected genes related to glycosis and gluconeogenesis and tca cycle. colors indicate the expression values: red indicates up-regulated expression and green indicates down-regulated expression. data is log base  <dig> relative to wt and bases on two duplicates



sorbitol is the primary photosynthate, translocated carbohydrate and reserve material in woody rosaceae species such as apple and pear  <cit> . nad+-dependent sorbitol dehydrogenase  catalyzes the transformation of sorbitol to fructose. the four mrsdhs identified from the deg analysis were all up-regulated . in constrast, isomerase and oxidoreductase genes regulating the transformation of sorbitol to glucose, such as mrmee <dig>  and mrfey , were down-regulated.fig.  <dig> changes in genes related to hormone signaling pathways, cell elongation and root development detected by degs analysis and qrt-pcr identification. a degs were mapped to plant hormone signal transduction pathways in kegg database. up-regulated, down-regulated, up/down-regulated genes and no degsare indicated by red, green, dashed and line boxes, respectively. the nucleus is shown behind vertical dashed lines. b–f qrt-pcr-based identification of sugar metabolism, auxin, cytokinin, cell elongation and root development-related genes. values are means ± se 



to carry out sugar metabolism via the glycolytic pathway, fructose-6p functions as an integrated element downstream of glucose and fructose. fructose-6p is synthesized by aldolase superfamily protein , mannose-6-phosphate isomerase type i  and an nad-linked oxidoreductase superfamily protein , all of which were significantly repressed in mb-bearing rootstock roots . aconitase  <dig> , isocitrate dehydrogenase  and atp-citrate lyase a- <dig>  in tricarboxylic acid  cycle were down-regulated. phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  <dig> , which catalyzes the synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate that mediates glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, was also down-regulated .

expression of hormone signaling-related genes
selected hormone signaling-related genes encoding receptors and response factors, identified from kegg pathway analysis, were shown . the most obvious physiological effect of auxin is the promotion of organ and whole plant growth, which requires auxin transportation and signal transduction. auxin transporters identified from the apple genome, mrpin <dig> , two auxin-resist-ant <dig>  and one no vein  were repressed in grafted mb , whereas, mrpin <dig>  and mraux <dig>  were activated. auxin receptor gene transport inhibitor response <dig> , auxin f-box protein  <dig>  and mrskp2a  were activated in mb-bearing rootstock roots, but identified auxin response factors   were repressed . mrgh <dig> and small auxin up rna , regulating cell enlargement and plant growth downstream of mrarfs, were down-regulated . mrtch <dig> and mrcycd <dig>  which are downstream of br signaling and respectively responsible for cell elongation and cell division, were also down-regulated .

most cks receptors , which mediate ck-mediated repression of lr initiation  <cit> , were significantly repressed in grafted mb roots . the genes encoding histidine-containing phosphotransmitters , which are positive regulators of ck signaling, were down-regulated. some type b response regulators  genes were up-regulated while others were simultaneously down-regulated. mrarrs , which are suppressors of b-arrs after the acceptance of a phosphate group from ahps, were significantly up-regulated  <cit> .

finally, aba response factors mrsnrk2s and mrabfs were up-regulated in roots of grafted mb . these genes are mainly activated by abiotic stress conditions, such as salt stress, water deprivation and osmotic stress  <cit> .

expression of genes related to root development, the cell cycle and growth
several development-related genes operating in root meristem were selected to observe their activities . in prs of grafted mb, several positive regulatory genes, including mrshr , mrahk <dig> , mriaa <dig> , poltergeist like  <dig>  and tornado  <dig> , were repressed significantly, whereas some negative regulatory genes, including wooden leg  <dig> , mrtir <dig> , mrshy <dig> , retinoblastoma-related  <dig>  and kip-related protein  <dig> , were significantly up-regulated . mralf <dig> , a positive regulator during lr formation, was activated in roots of grafted mb . moreover, like auxin resistant  <dig>  and mralf <dig> , which negatively regulate the formation of aberrant lrs, were more than 3-fold down-regulated in roots of grafted mb . these results were consistent with observed root phenotypes .

cells are the basic structural and functional units of organisms. selected cell cycle-related genes , namely, mrcycd <dig> , mrcycd <dig> , mrcycd <dig> , glucan synthase-like  <dig> , k+ transporter  <dig>  and mrkac <dig> , were significantly repressed in roots of mb-bearing rootstock. two mrtch <dig> genes , which are positively regulated by br signaling as well as mrcycd <dig>  were down-regulated in roots of grafted mb.

discussion
scion characteristics affect rootstock sugar metabolism
kegg biological functions pathway analysis indicated that most genes related to hormone signal transduction, cell transcription and translation activity were down-regulated , thus suggesting that root growth and development rates were repressed both at subcellular and transcriptional levels. however, more intensive changes requires further biochemical verification.

hetero-grafting experiments have demonstrated that some phloem-mobile transcripts target to root tips and modify root architectures  <cit> . given the consistent genetic background between wt and mb, any changes in root phenotypes in the same growth environment can be assumed to stem from differences in scion characteristics . plant growth and development is dependent on hormonal triggers and metabolic factors, such as photosynthetic efficiency and nutrient uptake  <cit> .

photoassimilates are the only source of sugar in photosynthetic organisms. although sorbitol content was dramatically decreased in grafted mb relative to the wt, mainly because of limited photosynthetic ability and transport volume, the contents of sucrose, fructose and glucose in root, required for the glycolytic pathway, were unchanged. the up-regulation of nad-sdhs is only useful for the sorbitol to fructose transition. genes related to the tca cycle as well as most glycolysis genes were also significantly repressed in grafted mb . recent studies found that sucrose could also serve as a signal prior to hormonal action in apical dominance and bud outgrowth, and that this was positively concentration-dependent  <cit> . these results suggest that the growth and development of grafted mb suffers, at least metabolically, from limitations to glycolysis and the tca cycle.

regulation of root development and growth by auxin and ck signaling
in plants, the auxin pathway, including polar auxin transport and auxin signal transduction processes, is involved in stages of embryonic and postembryonic root development ranging from hypophysis to meristem initiation, emergence and elongation .

auxin has tissue-specific and exerts contradictory activities in roots. at high concentrations, auxin inhibits root elongation. because grafted wt and mb roots had similar auxin contents, however, reduced auxin levels cannot be responsible for the low rate of root growth observed in mb-bearing rootstock . studies have shown that pin <dig> and pin <dig> localization directs auxin flow in plants; this is particularly true of downward pin1-dependent flow, which is positively associated with flow volume and growth rate . consistent with those study findings and the low growth rate of grafted mb roots observed in our study, we discovered that the expressions of mrpin <dig> and related genes such as mrshr were down-regulated in roots grafted mb . conversely, however, high auxin and down-regulated expression of mrpin <dig> can help induce division and differentiation of founder cells  <cit> , events that precede the expression of genes needed for lr formation. although pin <dig>  pin <dig> and pin <dig> can specifically change the distribution of auxin in the root elongation zone  <cit> , the expression of their encoding genes was not detected in this study. finally, up-regulated mrpin <dig> can also increase auxin distribution into pericycle cells to trigger pericycle cell division  <cit> .

following auxin distribution, auxin signal transduction induces downstream gene expression or crosstalk with other hormone signals. in the present study, the presence of an up-regulated auxin receptors, mrtir <dig> and mrafb <dig>  was consistent with the observed higher auxin content and down-regulation of mraux/iaa transcriptional repressor proteins . as all the genes influenced by auxin are controlled by the activation or inhibition of mrarfs  <cit> . therefore, arfs down-regulation may be ultimately responsible for the low rate of root growth observed in grafted mb.

like auxin, cks also play a crucial role in regulating meristem activity  <cit> . according to a previous study, zr is the main suppressor of lateral and adventitious root formation  <cit> . experimental verification involving ck deficiency and exogenous application indicates that cks inhibit pr growth and lr initiation within a restricted root meristem region via cre1/ahk3/b-arrs signaling  <cit> . one mode of ck action is the regulation of the expression of genes such as cre <dig>  shy <dig> and pin <dig> as well as cell cycle-related genes  <cit> . in another mode, which does not involve transcripts, cks specifically promote pin <dig> degradation by disturbing its endocytic recycling in vacuoles, and reduce its abundance on the plasma membrane through an unknown mechanism  <cit> . in mb-bearing rootstock, root phenotypic changes such as pr length and lr number were accordingly consistent with changes of ck signaling components, such as the up-regulation of mrshy <dig> and mra-arrs . in a study in arabidopsis, however, exogenous auxin could not rescue the ck-mediated inhibition of lr initiation; in addition, the effect of cks effect on lr formation was similar between the wild type and auxin mutants harboring in response- and transportation-associated defects  <cit> . consequently, cks and auxin signaling pathways are partially independent during lr initiation; their interaction is more than just a simple antagonism, however, with a balance probably maintained between them in restricted root regions.

mediation of multiple signaling by root development-related genes
specific genes associated with root meristematic activity and differentiation have been identified from root mutants  <cit> . in arabidopsis prs, the balance between cell division and differentiation is coordinated by shy <dig>  which regulates auxin signaling negatively and ck signaling positively, respectively  <cit> . shy <dig> expression in grafted mb may have been influenced by ck signaling. as a positive signal of longitudinal growth, shr expression was specific to roots, dependent on root development and growth  <cit> , and highest in roots of grafted wt. expressions of mrgh <dig>  and mrtch <dig>  responsible for cell elongation or enlargement, were also higher—a response to auxin and br, respectively .

overexpression of rbr rapidly represses stem cell properties, and delays cell division and differentiation  <cit> . these changes are similar to the inhibitory effect of kpr <dig> on cycd2; <dig> and cyclin-dependent kinase, which is negatively regulated by auxin  <cit> . cycd2; <dig> expression is regulated by sucrose, however, which is not responsive to auxin  <cit> . in our study, mrkpr <dig> expression was up-regulated in roots of mb-bearing rootstock with higher auxin content , perhaps because this gene is located downstream of mrarfs.

in contrast to the alf <dig> phenotype, the aberrant lateral root formation- <dig>  mutant is characterized by an increased number of lrs  <cit> . additionally, alf <dig> expression and subcellular locatization of alf <dig> are essential to maintain the mitosis of pericycle cells, a process independent of auxin signaling  <cit> . however, several studies have shown that auxin plays an essential role from lr initiation to lr growth  <cit> . given the expression trends observed for mralf <dig> and mralf <dig> in our study, grafted mb should have had a significantly higher number of lrs than grafted wt . consequently, these findings may indicate that the expression of some independent genes for lr development can be repressed by auxin or ck signaling pathways.

cell division and differentiation during root growth and development
in roots, active cell division and differentiation primarily occurs in the root meristem zone and may thus regulate the rate of root growth and development  <cit> . in regard to root growth, the down-regulated expression of cell division- and differentiation- related genes was thus consistent with the root phenotype of grafted mb . the stimulatory effect of auxin on cell division is strongly linked to cell cycle processes. with respect to auxin response, many cell cycle-related genes were in fact up-regulated in roots, whereas cell cycle protein inhibiting factors such as krp1/ <dig>  were down-regulated  <cit> .

apart from auxin, the positive role of br on root growth and development can also be triggered by stimulating the cell cycle in pr meristem  <cit> . moreover, exogenously applied br can promote the expression of auxin response genes and lr development, with these effects inhibited by n- phthalamic acid   <cit> . when exogenous br is present, lr development is further activated by the addition of exogenous auxin, which may indicate the existence of a synergistic effect between auxin and br in root development. in our study, however, brassinazole resistant 1/ <dig>  genes, which are positive regulators of the br signalling pathway, were activated in mb-bearing roots . this result may be evidence that auxin signaling genes function downstream of the br signaling pathway to regulate root cell division.

although the cell cycle and cell division are insufficient to activate the formation of lrs or buds  <cit> , the processes of cell division, differentiation and enlargement are required for lr initiation, emergence and elongation, even when restricted to pericycle cells  <cit> . furthermore, the overall number of lrs was high in grafted mb . this finding suggests that pericycle cell division and differentiation were active in roots of grafted mb. importantly, these results thus obviously indicate that increased rates of cell division and differentiation in mb were mainly limited to root growth. as inferred from the correspondence with root morphology in mb , the regulated expression of cell cycle- and growth-related genes may be a direct indicator of root growth.

scion influences on root resistance and nitrogen metabolism
aba plays an important role in plant dormancy and stress resistance  <cit> . although previous studies have variously found that aba has negative or positive effects on root development, its effect is mainly related to auxin pathways  <cit> . compared with shoot tips and stems, the aba content of roots was significantly lower in all grafted seedlings . moreover, the undifferentiated concentration of soluble sugars in roots, unlike that of leaves, was insufficient to increase osmotic pressure—a factor playing an important role in abiotic stress response  <cit> . these results suggest that roots are maintained in a relatively stable environment.

further analysis revealed that the expressions of aba response factor genes, which induce dormancy and stress responses, were significantly up-regulated in roots of grafted mb . moreover, expressions of salicylic acid signal-related genes  for disease resistance were significantly repressed in roots of mb . concerning root vigor, expressions of nitrogen metabolism related-genes for nitrogen uptake and synthesis of amino acids were repressed . these results indicate that root vigor was suppressed in grafted mb, possibly leading to limitations on root development and growth.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, root phenotypes of identical rootstock materials were notably influenced by a more branching mutant, compared to wild type. to gain global insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for different phenotypes based on consistent genetic backgrounds of scions, rna-seq of roots was performed to analyze gene expression patterns of development-related biological processes. specific biological functions analysis indicated that most genes related to hormone signal transduction, cell transcription and translation activity and sugar metabolism were down-regulated. a combined analysis of plant growth dynamics and sugar and hormone contents in roots indicated that scion characteristics can influence rootstock phenotypes, which were mainly regulated by sugar metabolism and auxin and ck signaling pathways. these results may be helpful for further understanding of the mechanisms that cause grafting and internal conditions to influence root growth and development. moreover, root activity and resistance are also repressed in roots of grafted mb. these results thus imply that the scion characteristics influencing these processes contribute to root growth and development, resistance and activity of rootstock.
