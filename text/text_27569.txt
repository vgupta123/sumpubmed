BACKGROUND
in humans, the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies  is a diagnostic criterion for the antiphospholipid syndrome , which manifests with thrombosis or recurrent fetal loss in women and is often accompanied with thrombocytopenia  <cit> . aps in the absence of other related autoimmune diseases is referred to as primary aps. besides being present in primary aps, the apl autoantibodies are often found in patients with other autoimmune diseases, especially systemic lupus erythematosus  and immune thrombocytopenia   <cit> . the apl autoantibodies in humans have been recognized as lupus anticoagulants , anticardiolipin , antiphosphatidylinositol , antiphosphatidylserine , antiphosphatidic acid , antiphosphatidylglycine , antiphosphatidylcholine , and anti-β <dig> glycoprotein i antibodies   <cit> . among them, acl and aβ2gpi detected by elisa, together with la determined by screening assays, are now required as one or more of the three laboratory criteria, along with one clinical manifestation , for the diagnosis of aps in humans  <cit> . alternatively, several reports have suggested that aphl antibody elisas, which detect antibodies against a mixture of noncardiolipin antigens , can be used for human aps diagnosis . apart from thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity, thrombocytopenia is a common manifestation in both aps   <cit>  and sle patients   <cit> . although thrombocytopenia had previously been proposed to serve as a preliminary classification criterion of aps in sle patients  <cit> , it was not included in the later revised aps classification criteria  <cit> . on the other hand, a recent investigation of  <dig> thrombocytopenia patients with apl found that half of them developed aps  <cit> . the authors of that study suggested that apl-positive thrombocytopenia patients, along with less frequent hemolytic anemia patients, should be considered as having hematologic aps  <cit> .

until now, canine apl-related studies have been limited. in  <dig>  the presence of acl was detected in  <dig> of  <dig> diseased dogs by setting a cut-off value based on the sera of  <dig> healthy dogs, and four aps-like diseased dogs, including one dog with recurrent abortion and severe thrombocytopenia, were found to have high levels of acl  <cit> . interestingly,  <dig> bernese mountain dogs, a breed which has been shown to have a prolonged phospholipid-dependent coagulation time, presented with significantly higher levels of acl than the controls   <cit> . nonetheless, a recent study did not correlate apl with thrombosis or immune-mediated hemolytic anemia in dogs  <cit> . the involvement of apl with thrombocytopenia, a clinical manifestation frequently occurred in aps patients, remains to be clarified in dogs.

we initiated the investigation on dogs with thrombocytopenia, in particular, immune thrombocytopenia that usually manifests with significantly lower platelet counts than thrombocytopenia of other origins  <cit> . the objective of this study was to explore whether any subtypes of apl are associated with thrombocytopenia or immune thrombocytopenia in pet dogs. indirect elisas were performed to measure and compare the levels and prevalence of aphl, aβ2gpi, acl, api, apc, and aps igg antibodies in outpatient dogs with or without thrombocytopenia and in healthy dogs.

RESULTS
normal platelet reference range of dogs is  <dig> – 500 × 103/ul  <cit> . however, dogs with a platelet count of less than 80 × 103/ul are more likely to have clinical complications  <cit> . in our study, serum samples were divided into three groups. group i consisted of  <dig> outpatient dogs with thrombocytopenia . group ii consisted of  <dig> outpatient dogs without thrombocytopenia . to avoid any interference from other aps-related manifestations, dogs with thrombosis, pregnancy morbidity, and hemolytic anemia were not included in group i and group ii outpatient dogs. as a control, group iii consisted of  <dig> healthy dogs. group i has an average age of  <dig>  years and a female to male ratio of  <dig> . group ii has an average age of  <dig>  years and a female to male ratio of  <dig> . group iii has an average age of  <dig>  and a female to male ratio of  <dig> . basic information  of three groups of dogs and clinical manifestations of outpatient dogs  are listed in the additional file  <dig> 

in dogs, immune thrombocytopenia often manifests with significantly lower platelet counts than other forms of thrombocytopenia  <cit> . therefore, a diagnosis of presumptive immune thrombocytopenia is usually made if a dog’s platelet count falls below certain cut-off values  <cit> . for example, o’marra et al.  <cit>  have categorized thrombocytopenic dogs with platelet counts of less than 30 × 103/μl and without any other underlying disease as having presumptive primary immune thrombocytopenia. furthermore, a recent study by iraqi et al.  <cit>  has verified the pathological role of antiplatelet antibodies  in the development of immune thrombocytopenia. in the present study, we selected  <dig> outpatient dogs with severe thrombocytopenia  from group i and examined their sera for the presence of aplt. positive threshold for aplt  was determined as 99th percentile of healthy dogs . group i dogs were further divided into three subgroups. severe thrombocytopenic dogs with positive aplt were designated as group ia  , which included outpatient dogs with primary immune thrombocytopenia and those with immune thrombocytopenia secondary to other diseases. severe thrombocytopenic dogs negative for aplt were designated as group ib . on the other hand, less severe thrombocytopenic dogs with platelet count between  <dig> – 80 × 103/μl were designated as group ic . the average level of aplt in group ia was  <dig>  ng/ml . the results of aplt measurement in group ia, group ib, and healthy control are shown in the additional file  <dig> 

expression of β2gpi antigen for aβ2gpi antibodies detection
the presence of aβ2gpi antibodies has been listed as one of the laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of aps  <cit> . for the detection of aβ2gpi antibodies in dogs, we cloned human β2gpi cdna from hela cells and expressed the recombinant β2gpi . the rβ2gpi protein was purified by metal chelation chromatography. the purified rβ2gpi protein was analyzed by sds-page and western blot, and the identity of rβ2gpi was verified by mass spectrometry .

dog igg and human aphl igg standard curves
using commercially quantified dog igg as standards, we performed a sandwich elisa to establish a standard curve for dog igg calibration. rabbit anti-dog igg f <dig> fragment antibodies were used as capture antibodies, and dog igg standards  were added as calibrators. a standard elisa curve, with an r squared value of  <dig> , was generated by using linear regression . this standard equation was applied to deduce igg concentrations  of various autoantibodies in canine sera .fig.  <dig> dog igg and human aphl igg standard curves. a sandwich elisa was performed to establish a calibration curve for dog igg . rabbit anti-dog igg f <dig> fragment antibodies were coated onto the elisa plate. different concentrations  of dog igg were added into each well. peroxidase conjugated-rabbit anti-dog igg fc fragment antibody was used to detect dog igg. od =  <dig>  × concentration +  <dig> . r2 =  <dig> . to obtain a human aphl igg standard curve, aphl igg reference calibrators  available in a human aphl igg elisa kit were used . od =  <dig>  × concentration +  <dig> . r2 =  <dig> . the od  values are shown as means ± standard error 



as a comparison, reference human aphl igg standards  available in a human aphl igg elisa kit were used. a standard elisa curve was generated by using linear regression, with an r squared value of  <dig>  .

comparing serum levels of apl subtypes in different groups of dogs
by using an indirect elisa, a mixture of non-cardiolipin phospholipids  consisting of ps, phosphatidic acid , and β2gpi, available from an aphl igg hrp elisa kit, were incubated sequentially with diluted  canine sera and with hrp conjugated-rabbit anti-dog igg antibodies to measure aphl in canine sera. similarly, using rβ2gpi, cl, pi, pc, and ps as the coated antigens, we added canine sera  and hrp conjugated-rabbit anti-dog igg antibodies to measure aβ2gpi, acl, api, apc, and aps in canine sera by indirect elisas.

the average elisa od readings for aphl, aβ2gpi, acl, api, apc, and aps obtained from outpatient dogs with thrombocytopenia , and subgroups ia, ib, and ic were all significantly higher than those healthy dogs  . average od readings for aphl and acl obtained from group i and subgroups ia, ib, and ic were significantly higher than those obtained from group ii . in addition, compared with group ii, group i and subgroup ia had significantly higher levels of aβ2gpi and apc whereas subgroup ib had significantly higher level of api.fig.  <dig> levels of apl subtypes determined by elisa. the apl subtypes in canine sera were measured. group i: outpatient dogs with thrombocytopenia . subgroups of group i: ia  , ib  , and ic  . group ii: outpatient dogs without thrombocytopenia . group iii: healthy dogs . *group i, or subgroup ia, ib, or ic is significantly higher than group ii . †group iii is significantly lower than group i, and subgroups ia, ib, and ic . the od  values are shown as means ± se



based on the equation derived from the standard elisa curve , the od readings of indirect elisas  were converted directly into igg levels  for aphl, aβ2gpi, acl, api, apc, and aps . from high to low, average igg levels of aphl, aβ2gpi, acl, api, apc, and aps among outpatient dogs with thrombocytopenia  were  <dig> –  <dig>   <dig> –  <dig>   <dig> –  <dig>   <dig> –  <dig>   <dig> – <dig>  and  <dig> –  <dig> gpl, respectively . on the other hand, average igg levels of aphl, aβ2gpi, acl, api, apc, and aps in outpatient dogs without thrombocytopenia  were lower than those of group i, but higher than those of group iii .table  <dig> average igg levels of antiphospholipid antibodies  among different groups of dogs

because the average age of group iii healthy dogs was lower than the average ages of the outpatient dogs  , we investigated whether age affected the level of antiphospholipid antibodies in healthy dogs. group iii  were divided into older and younger subgroups. the average elisa od readings for aphl, aβ2gpi, acl, api, apc, and aps obtained from older and younger subgroups were not significantly different . in addition, considering that the female to male ratio in group iii healthy dogs was lower than the ratios among the outpatient dogs , we divided group iii into female and male subgroups to explore whether gender was a factor for the antiphospholipid antibodies in healthy dogs. the average elisa od readings for aphl, aβ2gpi, acl, api, apc, and aps were comparable in the female and male subgroups . the fact that levels of aphl, aβ2gpi, acl, api, apc, and aps were comparable between older and younger subgroups, and between female and male subgroups among healthy dogs excludes the need for setting any age- or gender-specific positive thresholds.

frequencies of apl subtypes based on the 98th or 99th percentile cut-off values and relative risks for thrombocytopenia
the positive thresholds for apl subtypes were determined either as the average od values obtained from group iii healthy dogs plus two standard deviations   or plus  <dig>  sd . based on the 98th or 99th percentile cut-off values, the frequencies of positive aphl, aβ2gpi, acl, api, apc, and aps in outpatient dogs with thrombocytopenia  were significantly higher  than in healthy dogs . comparing between group i  and group iii, the relative risks for outpatient dogs positive for aphl, aβ2gpi, acl, api, apc, aps versus  healthy dogs negative for those apl subtypes to develop thrombocytopenia were  <dig> – ∞,  <dig> –  <dig>   <dig> – ∞,  <dig> –  <dig>   <dig> –  <dig>  and  <dig> –  <dig>  respectively .table  <dig> frequency of antiphospholipid antibodies among different groups of dogs based on the 98th percentile cut-off

among outpatient dogs, the positive frequency of acl  was significantly higher in group i  and subgroup ia , ib , and ic  than in outpatient dogs without thrombocytopenia  . the relative risks of acl positive outpatient dogs  for having thrombocytopenia , immune thrombocytopenia with aplt , severe thrombocytopenia without aplt , and less severe thrombocytopenia  were  <dig> ,  <dig> , ∞  and ∞ , respectively. in addition to acl, significantly higher positive frequencies of aβ2gpi , apc , and aps  were observed in group ia than those observed in group ii, with relative risks around  <dig> . in comparison with group ii, the positive frequency of aps  was significantly higher in group ib, with a relative risk of  <dig>  or  <dig>  .

discussion
in this study, we used indirect elisas to measure and compare serum igg levels of apl subtypes  in dogs with or without thrombocytopenia and in healthy dogs. using a secondary antibody to amplify signal, indirect elisa is more sensitive than direct elisa  <cit> . in addition, indirect elisa allows us to use one common conjugated secondary antibody to measure different apl subtypes.

at this point, reference dog sera are not available nor have cut-off values been established for canine apl subtypes other than acl. in an earlier report, papini et al.  <cit>  estimated canine acl levels based on an equation obtained from measuring human reference sera and determined the cut-off value as mean plus  <dig> sd. in our study, we measured levels of apl subtypes based on a standard curve established for dog igg calibration , which appeared comparable to that generated by using reference human aphl igg standards . in humans, elisa cut-off values for acl have been diversely determined as mean plus  <dig> sd  or  <dig> sd or  <dig> sd, or at the 95th or 99th percentiles . in our present study, we assessed and compared the association of apl subtypes with thrombocytopenia based on the 98th percentile  and 99th percentile  cut-off values. based on these cut-off values, canine sera determined as aphl positive could compete with human reference serum  for phl  binding , indicating that our elisa is reliable.

we mainly investigated apl subtypes on clinically relevant thrombocytopenic outpatient dogs  that have much lower platelet count  than group ii . this approach reduces the chance of overlapping grouping. we further divided thrombocytopenic dogs into three subgroups to explore the relevance of apl subtypes to the severity of the disease  and to the presence or absence of aplt . frequencies of apc, and aps appeared higher in severe thrombocytopenic dogs  than in less severe thrombocytopenic dogs  whereas frequencies of acl and aβ2gpi were higher within thrombocytopenic outpatient dogs than in those without thrombocytopenia . in contrast, aphl frequencies are comparably high among outpatient dogs . interestingly, such tendencies  were also observed when we compared frequencies of apl subtypes in mild thrombocytopenic dogs  with those in group i  thrombocytopenic dogs or those in group ii  . these results suggest that acl and aβ2gpi could have potential to be markers for thrombocytopenia among outpatients dogs and the presence of apc and aps may help to reflect the severity of thrombocytopenia.

among all tested apl subtypes, acl poses the highest relative risk in outpatient dogs for having thrombocytopenia , immune thrombocytopenia with aplt , severe thrombocytopenia without aplt , or less severe thrombocytopenia  . this result indicates an important role of acl in canine thrombocytopenia, including immune thrombocytopenia and particularly in severe thrombocytopenia without aplt and in less severe thrombocytopenia. furthermore, based on higher relative risks, outpatient dogs present with aβ2gpi  and apc  are around two fold more likely to have immune thrombocytopenia  and those with aps are two to three fold more likely to have immune thrombocytopenia  or severe thrombocytopenia without aplt  . in the future, it would be interesting to explore whether acl, aβ2gpi, apc, and aps poses differential risks under the presence or absence of aplt in less severe thrombocytopenia or even mild thrombocytopenia. it is worth noting that our supplement data indicate that the levels of all the apl subtypes examined here were not significantly different between older and younger subgroups of normal healthy dogs . this observation is in agreement with that reported by budd et al.  <cit>  for human acl.

although the average igg levels of aphl were significantly higher  in outpatient dogs with thrombocytopenia or immune thrombocytopenia than in those without , the fact that prevalences of positive aphl in thrombocytopenia or immune thrombocytopenic outpatient dogs and in outpatient dogs with other diseases were comparably high indicates that the presence of aphl may thus not be applicable as a diagnostic criterion for canine thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenia, or aps-related disorders. interestingly, aphl, recognizing a mixture of non-cardiolipin antigens, which are comprised of ps, pa, and β2gpi, have been reported to be specifically detected in human patients with antiphospholipid syndrome  and not in other disorders . there could be disparities between human and canine aps regarding the specificity of apl subtypes or clinical manifestations. for example, the results of our study indicate that aphl, preferentially detected in human aps patients, may not be specific for aps-related disorders in dogs. in particular, canine apa that was not examined individually in our present study  deserves future investigation. in addition, a recent study has shown that thrombosis, which is known to be associated with apl and is listed as one marked manifestation for the diagnosis of aps in humans  <cit> , may not be correlated well with apl in dogs  <cit> . overall, here in our study we observed a high prevalence of apl  in outpatient dogs with thrombocytopenia , immune thrombocytopenia with positive aplt , severe thrombocytopenia without aplt . interestingly, in the recently held 14th international antiphospholipid congress, experts in the field discussed whether to include thrombocytopenia and several other non-criteria clinical manifestations of aps as aps classification criteria  <cit> . based on data presented in related medical literature and considering that apl related thrombocytopenia increases the risk of thrombosis, abreu et al.  <cit>  categorize thrombocytopenia as “recommended to be included as part of aps criteria revision” although the quality of data is low. in the future, it is imperative to carry out extensive investigations to clarify whether thrombocytopenia can be listed as one clinical manifestation of human aps or canine aps-related disorders. follow-up surveys are needed to compare the incidence of thrombocytopenia, pregnancy morbidity, hemolytic anemia, and thrombosis among dogs with positive antiphospholipid antibodies.

CONCLUSIONS
of all the apl subtypes tested here, acl is highly associated with canine thrombocytopenia, including immune thrombocytopenia, and particularly severe thrombocytopenia negative for aplt and less severe thrombocytopenia. furthermore, aps is moderately associated with both canine immune thrombocytopenia and severe thrombocytopenia negative for aplt, whereas aβ2gpi, and apc are moderately relevant to canine immune thrombocytopenia. in contrast, api is not significantly associated with canine immune thrombocytopenia.
