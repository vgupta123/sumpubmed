BACKGROUND
recently, in addition to core, peripheral populations are also gaining importance for gene conservation, because under global climate change conditions they may possess genotypes of future adaptive potential. plant populations tend to migrate further from their range periphery to ensure their survival by developing adaptability in a changing environmental condition due to global warming  <cit> . genetic studies involving both core and peripheral populations are still limited  <cit> . additionally, the available studies mainly focused on within-and among-population genetic diversity  <cit> , and majority of them reported higher genetic diversity and lower population differentiation in core than in peripheral populations. although still limited, there are increasing reports on sgs in fragmented versus continuous populations e.g.,  <cit> . however, information on the comparison of sgs between core and peripheral populations of plant species is almost non-existent. the only published report on this aspect by gapare & aitken  <cit>  reported significantly higher sgs in peripheral and random distribution of genotypes in core populations of predominantly outcrossing conifer, sitka spruce . the level of sgs within plant populations depends on seed and pollen dispersal, mating system, mode of reproduction, size of the founder population, species longevity, adult population density, effective population size, and micro environmental selection  <cit> . anthropogenic disturbance and fragmentation of populations can also influence sgs by restricting gene flow and increasing local drift due to severe modification of forest environment and ecosystem, and density of populations  <cit> . information on sgs levels in core and peripheral populations can unravel differential effect of the key evolutionary and ecological genetic processes operating in natural plant populations, such as gene dispersal, natural selection and genetic drift. analysis of sgs is also important for understanding the population dynamics of a species as its response to micro-environmental variation and global climate change  <cit> . furthermore, knowledge of sgs in natural populations is also important for developing scientifically-sound sampling strategies for genetic resource conservation and breeding purposes.

higher sgs may be expected in peripheral than in core populations of long-lived plants, such as forest trees, owing to the differences in founding population, seed and pollen dispersal, adult plant density, inbreeding levels, effective population size , and disturbance and selection regimes. restricted gene flow due to limited seed and pollen dispersal can promote mating among relatives which can result in isolation by distance within a population  <cit> . therefore, a local genetic subdivision can develop sgs within populations. selfing and other forms of inbreeding can limit gene dispersal, consequently influencing the spatial distribution of genetic variation within populations  <cit> . in contrast, generally, outcrossing decreases population subdivision by reducing mating among relatives and increasing ne  <cit> . therefore, higher level of sgs can be expected in inbreeding species as compared to outcrossing species. vegetative clonal reproduction can significantly affect the sgs through the development of spatial clusters of the members of a clone  <cit> . long-lived plants are expected to have low levels of sgs within their populations because of decreased population divergence due to increased ne and decreased genetic drift over time  <cit> . sgs has been found to be inversely correlated with adult density within populations  <cit> . additionally, the levels of sgs were found to be positively correlated with the level of fragmentation of plant populations e.g.,  <cit> .

conifers are generally long-lived plants that are ecologically and economically important globally. they constitute a major component of the northern boreal and temperate forests, especially dominating the boreal forest which comprises one of the largest biomes in the world http://www.borealforest.org/index.php?category=world_boreal_forest&page=overview. most of the conifer tree species are characterized by predominantly  outcrossing mating system. studies in conifers reported either no or weak levels of sgs within populations  <cit> . this is consistent with the conifers' characteristics of predominant outcrossing, wind-pollination and seed dispersal by wind. except for two studies  <cit> , all of the sgs studies in conifers are reported for pinus or picea species. furthermore, with the exception of two  <cit> , all other studies on sgs in conifers are based on only one or two populations. all of the sgs studies in conifers have been reported for predominantly outcrossing  species, and there is no sgs information on plant species that have mixed-mating system with high selfing levels.

eastern  white cedar  provides an ideal model species to study sgs in core versus peripheral populations of declining and long-lived plant species with mixed mating system. eastern white cedar is a wind-pollinated, monoecious, evergreen tree species belonging to the cypress family . it reproduces both sexually and vegetatively. vegetative reproduction occurs mainly in swampy sites by layering  <cit> . eastern white cedar is an ecologically and economically important tree species, highly suitable for many wood products. since its foliage is a favorite winter food for deer, it is very important for wildlife conservation. it can reach an age of  <dig> years  <cit> .

the natural distribution range of eastern white cedar extends from manitoba east to nova scotia, and south into the great lakes regions of the united states, east to new england, with southern disjunct populations in the appalachians in north carolina and tennessee . eastern white cedar reaches its eastern periphery in nova scotia and the prince edward island , where it occurs in small, scattered and fragmented populations  <cit> . historical records indicate that the range and number of populations of eastern white cedar have diminished due to logging, and clearing for agriculture over the past  <dig> years in nova scotia and pei  <cit> . presently, there are only  <dig> identified populations of eastern white cedar in nova scotia  <cit> , which are highly fragmented. due to its rarity in nova scotia, eastern white cedar has been designated as a red  species in this province. in prince edward island, occurrence of eastern white cedar is limited to only a few populations, mainly found in the western part of the island . eastern white cedar is common in new brunswick, where it forms its best development  <cit> . thus, new brunswick represents the core or central range of this species. however, here also eastern white cedar has been listed as a species of concern.

like other cedar species , eastern white cedar also possesses relatively low genetic diversity  <cit> . it is characterized by a mixed-mating system with high levels  of selfing rates  <cit> . although a few genetic diversity studies have been conducted in the genus thuja  <cit> , to our best knowledge, there is no information available on sgs in any thuja species. the only sgs study in the cupressaceae family was done for one population of an outcrossing species, cryptomeria japonica  <cit> , which reported significant sgs at short distance classes  based on nuclear microsatellites, but non-significant sgs for chloroplast microsatellites.

the aim of the present study was to determine within-population fine-scale genetic structure of eastern white cedar growing in core and peripheral populations. our hypotheses were:  since eastern white cedar is a mixed-mating long-lived tree with high levels of selfing rate, and has capability to reproduce vegetatively, this species is expected to have some levels of sgs within population;  the peripheral populations of eastern white cedar are expected to have higher levels of sgs than the core populations due to their lower population density; potentially restricted gene dispersal, smaller ne, and higher anthropogenic fragmentation as compared to the core populations  <cit> .

methods
populations and sampling
four natural populations of eastern white cedar were sampled from two maritime provinces of canada. two of these were core  populations from new brunswick and other two were peripheral  populations from nova scotia . we restricted sampling of the core and peripheral populations to the same maritime region of eastern canada to avoid other regional and ecological effects confounding the results. the two populations sampled in new brunswick are located in the central part of the species' range. despite some harvesting activities, eastern white cedar populations remain intact with contiguous distribution in this province with no barrier to gene flow between populations. on the other hand, the two eastern white cedar populations sampled from nova scotia are disjunct, and highly fragmented and disturbed as they have experienced anthropogenic disturbances over a long period of time. it was not possible to find undisturbed pristine natural populations of eastern white cedar in both core and peripheral regions in eastern canada. also, fragmented core and contiguous peripheral populations could not be found in our study region. all of the sampled populations are over  <dig> years old. the populations sampled in nova scotia were from almost pure eastern white cedar stands, whereas the populations sampled from new brunswick are mixed with other tree species, such as black spruce  and balsam fir .

a plot consisting of ~  <dig> contiguous eastern white cedar trees was established in each of the four sampled populations irrespective of the plot area . all of the eastern white cedar individuals were sampled within these plots. we chose this sampling strategy to keep the sample size equal among all four sampled populations, in order to minimize the effects of sample size confounding the comparison of sgs results between the populations. spatial locations of each of the sampled trees were recorded as their geo-coordinates using a geographical positioning system . the spatial location maps of the sampled trees in each of the four populations are provided in figure  <dig> 

small amounts of foliage samples were collected from each of the  <dig> sampled trees in plastic ziplock bags containing silica gel. upon arrival to the lab, the foliage samples were stored at -20°c until processed for dna extraction.

dna extraction and genotyping
total genomic dna was extracted from the needle samples of individual trees using the dneasy plant mini kit . microsatellite dna markers of the nuclear genome were used for genotyping the sampled trees. a total of  <dig> microsatellite markers developed for the cupressaceae species were tested in eastern white cedar. of these,  <dig> were developed for thuja plicata  <cit> ,  and three for chameacyparis obtusa  <cit> . only six  of the  <dig> microsatellites yielded simple and scorable pcr  products. these six microsatellites were optimized and used for genotyping individual eastern white cedar trees. pcr amplifications were carried out using  <dig> μl reaction mixtures containing  <dig> to  <dig> ng of genomic dna, 1× pcr buffer,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  mm of each dntp,  <dig>  pmol of each primer and  <dig>  u taq dna polymerase . the epgradients master cycles  were used for pcr amplification of the sample dna, with the following thermocycling profile: initial denaturation step at 95°c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles each of 95°c for  <dig> sec, annealing temperature at  <dig> to 65°c for  <dig> sec, 72°c for  <dig> sec and final extension step of 72°c for  <dig> min. pcr products were separated on li-cor <dig> genetic analyzers . the genotypes of individual trees were first determined by scoring the li-cor gels with the saga gt program  and later verified by manual scoring.

statistical data analysis
genetic diversity and ne
the standard population genetic diversity parameters  and fixation index  were calculated using the program genalex  <cit> . allelic richness  was estimated using the program fstat  <cit> . genotypic diversity was determined by calculating observed and expected genotype additivity  as the sum of genotypes observed and expected under hardy-weinberg equilibrium over the loci  <cit> . deviations of genotypic frequencies from the hardy-weinberg expectation were tested using the markov chain method  in the genepop program  <cit> .

the effective population size  for each of the four populations was estimated using the maximum likelihood method of coalescent-theory and migrate program  <cit> . at first, the θ values were estimated for each population using migrate program and assuming an average microsatellite mutation rate of 10- <dig> per generation. the ne was calculated as θ/.

spatial distribution
pattern of spatial distribution of individual trees in the four eastern white cedar populations were estimated using univariate second-order ripley's  <cit> k-function for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> m distance classes . the weighted edge correction  <cit>  method was applied to correct the edge effect. monte carlo procedure was used to test the significance of deviation from a random distribution at 95% upper and lower confidence envelops, generating  <dig>  replications. these calculations were performed using the sppack program  <cit> .

spatial genetic structure 
we used smouse and peakall's  <cit>  spatial autocorrelation method to estimate the sgs in the four eastern white cedar populations employing the genalex  <dig>   <cit>  program. this method determines spatial distribution of genetic variation based on a frequency-weighted average over all alleles and loci and correlation coefficients of genotypes in relation to their spatial distance. it allows for the covariance between alleles . in order to facilitate the comparison of sgs among the four populations, we used  <dig> m distance class as representative because three, out of the four populations showed maximum values of ripley's k at this distance class. similar approach was used by oddou-muratorio et al.  <cit>  to select the distance class for sgs analysis in a tree species, sorbus torminalis.

in addition to the estimation of multilocus sgs parameters for each of the four populations separately, sgs analyses were also performed for combined subset each of core , and peripheral  populations, as well by combining all four populations to infer degrees of heterogeneity of sgs within and between subsets based on the method of smouse et al.  <cit>  using genalex  <dig>  program. these analyses permit us to formally test whether differences in sgs between the subsets of populations are statistically significant. since the analysis of sgs using combined multiple populations increases sample sizes, it increases statistical power of the analysis to detect the presence of sgs within populations. heterogeneity tests for single and multi-populations correlograms were performed as described by smouse et al.  <cit> . this method first performs the heterogeneity test of autocorrelation coefficient among individuals lag-by-lag using the pooled within-population correlograms. then the single-lag tests are used to perform an analogous heterogeneity test of multilag correlograms . single class  and multi-class  test criteria were used to test the heterogeneity of spatial autocorrelation  values between single and subsets of populations. heterogeneity in sgs for single distance classes between any two populations or a subset of populations was determined by performing the squared paired- sample t test   <cit> . sgs heterogeneity over all distance classes  in a population and  among populations was determined by using the ω test criteria  <cit>  under the null hypotheses that  there is no significant spatial autocorrelation at any distance class, and that  the spatial correlograms from all populations are homogeneous. statistical significance of all the analyses was performed by permutation test with  <dig>  replications at the 95% upper and lower confidence intervals.

the correlations of the sgs parameters  with ne , genetic diversity parameters and density of eastern white cedar trees within the sampled populations were determined by calculating the pearson correlation coefficients , using the minitab  <dig> package.

sp statistics and dispersal estimates
in order to quantify sgs and to compute neighborhood sizes and gene dispersal distances in the four eastern white cedar populations, sp statistic was estimated as follows: sp = -^bf/, where -^bf is the regression slope of the autocorrelogram and ^f <dig> is the mean kinship coefficient   <cit>  between individuals belonging to the first  distance class  <cit> . using the sp statistics, wright's neighborhood size nb  was also estimated. nb is defined as nb = 4πdeσg <dig>  where σg <dig> is the axial variance of gene dispersal and de the effective population density. estimates of gene dispersal distance  were determined assuming ratios of effective to census density, de/d, of  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . estimates of -^bf and ^f <dig> were carried out using spagedi program  <cit> . statistical significance  of the analyses was performed by permutation tests with  <dig>  replications.

RESULTS
genetic diversity and effective population size
in total,  <dig> alleles were observed at six microsatellite loci in four eastern white cedar populations. the core populations showed higher allelic as well as genotypic genetic diversity than the peripheral populations . also, the core populations possessed higher number of private alleles than the peripheral ones . the two core populations from new brunswick  showed very similar levels of genetic diversity. all four populations showed significant deviation from the hardy-weinberg equilibrium. the ne was  <dig> and  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> in the core populations, and  <dig> and  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> in the peripheral populations . as the objective of this study was to determine sgs, we do not focus on discussing genetic diversity results here. results on genetic diversity and population structure of  <dig> eastern white cedar populations from the same region are presented and discussed elsewhere  <cit> .

except for the population pair cl and rl, all pairs revealed significant heterogeneity in sgs between the populations based on the multi-class test criterion  . significant heterogeneity in sgs was also observed between the core and peripheral populations over the 0- <dig> m and 61- <dig> m distances  .

discussion
spatial genetic structure in eastern white cedar
our study demonstrates that eastern white cedar has significant within-population fine-scale genetic structure at short distances. this was clearly evident from significant positive sgs at ~ <dig> m to ~ <dig> m in four studied eastern white cedar populations; suggesting that individuals with similar alleles or genotypes were more often growing in proximity than expected by chance alone. the extent of the observed significant sgs depended upon the location of the populations . these results are discussed later in this section.

the extent of sgs for combined four eastern white cedar populations  is more than two times of that observed in one 20-years old population of another mixed-mating  species larix larcinia   <cit> . the existence of sgs in larix larcinia was explained primarily due to the effect of founding population. in contrast, predominantly-outcrossing species showed either weak or no within-population sgs e.g.  <cit> . thus, mixed-mating conifer species tolerating high levels of selfing apparently have higher sgs within their populations than the predominantly outcrossing conifers.

besides higher levels of selfing or inbreeding, limited gene flow and founding gene pool may be responsible for the observed short-distance sgs in eastern white cedar. restricted gene flow due to limited pollen and seed dispersal contributes to local grouping of individuals with similar alleles or genotypes  <cit> . in eastern white cedar, both pollen and seeds are disseminated by wind. we are not aware of any information on the average distance of pollen dispersal in this species. however, in conifers it is well known that pollen is dispersed in enormous amounts over considerable distances  <cit> . therefore, the restriction in gene flow due to limited pollen flow is less likely to happen in eastern white cedar, especially in the contiguous populations. however, in the peripheral populations, reduced gene flow may have contributed to the observed levels of fine-scale genetic structure as a result of fragmentation. fowells  <cit>  reported a seeding range of up to  <dig> m in eastern white cedar under normal conditions. interestingly, the mean level of sgs observed in eastern white cedar  falls within this range of the seeding distance. therefore, restricted gene flow due to limited seed dispersal may be one of the main reasons for the observed short-distance sgs in the species.

vegetative propagation through natural layering has been reported in eastern white cedar  <cit> . since the individuals established from vegetative propagation have genetic constitution identical to the source tree and grow in proximity forming clumps, this may generate a significant sgs at short distance intervals. however, we did not find any concrete evidence for vegetative propagation contributing to the observed levels of sgs in any of the four study populations. we detected only four to eight individuals  per population growing in proximity of each other with the same multilocus genotypes . this level of multilocus genotype sharing may be due to vegetative reproduction, selfing, a combination of these factors or just by chance. however, our data does not support vegetative propagation contributing to the observed levels of sgs in eastern white cedar. although, it is generally expected that vegetative reproduction is one of the major factors that may contribute to the occurrence of significant sgs in vegetatively reproducing species, chung & epperson  <cit>  found little effect of vegetative reproduction on sgs in eurya emarginata. they explained that the restriction in gene flow due to limited dispersal of seed and pollen could be the main reason for the observed sgs in the species.

spatial distribution pattern of trees
the analysis of spatial distribution pattern using ripley's k function indicated significant aggregation of trees in all four populations of eastern white cedar. within population spatial patterns of individual plants can be influenced by several factors such as variation in microsites, level of disturbance, seed dispersal patterns  <cit> . parker et al.  <cit>  and trabaud et al.  <cit>  reported a significant aggregation of tress in pinus clausa and pinus halepensis populations, respectively, and they explained that the observed aggregation could be due to either limited seed dispersal or recruitment of aggregated seedlings after stand disturbance due to fire. these factors may have contributed to the observed spatial pattern of individual trees in eastern white cedar populations. the effect of limited seed dispersal on the significant aggregation of individual trees may be evident from the significant sgs  observed in the four populations. although we are not aware of any records of fire in the studied populations, past occurrence of fire on the studied populations cannot be ruled out because fire is one of the main agents of natural disturbance in boreal forest  <cit> .

sgs in core versus peripheral populations
the mean significant sgs in the peripheral populations  was up to six times of that was observed in the core  populations. the difference in sgs between the core and peripheral populations was statistically significant . both nova scotia populations  showed the highest within-population sgs, and the lowest genetic diversity, stand density and ne. these populations are highly fragmented and affected by human disturbance for over  <dig> years ever since the arrival of european settlers in the province. the several-folds higher sgs levels observed in the two marginal and highly fragmented populations from nova scotia is likely due to reduced stand density, gene dispersal, genetic diversity and ne observed in these populations  as well as increased founder effect and genetic drift due to anthropogenic fragmentation and other disturbances. thus, the magnitude of evolutionary forces operating in core versus peripheral populations is probably different. it was not possible to dissect out the effects of anthropogenic fragmentation and disturbances on sgs in the peripheral populations from that of their peripheral location. comparisons of sgs between pristine core and pristine peripheral populations would have been ideal. however, in the eastern maritime canadian range of eastern white cedar where our study was focused, no peripheral population could be found that is not anthropogenically fragmented and disturbed. thus, fragmentation and disturbance may also have contributed to higher sgs observed in the peripheral populations. the negative correlations of sgs with stand density, genetic diversity parameters and ne are consistent with the population genetic theories and expectations. the negative correlation between genetic diversity and sgs could be due to the combined effect of founder effects and reduced stand density.

the spatial distribution of genotypes was found to be random in the core populations of sitka spruce, whereas significant positive sgs up to  <dig> m was observed in the peripheral populations of this species  <cit> . in eastern white cedar, we observed mean significant positive sgs up to  <dig> m  in the peripheral and up to  <dig> m in the core populations. thus, the magnitude of impact of ecological and evolutionary factors on sgs in peripheral populations of sitka spruce appears to be much higher than in eastern white cedar. sitka spruce is a predominantly outcrossing species. the extent of differences observed in within-population sgs in core versus peripheral populations between these species may be related to the differences in their mating system. the mixed-mating species with relatively low inherent genetic diversity, such as eastern white cedar, can perhaps tolerate better negative effects  than the predominantly outcrossing species with relatively high genetic diversity, such as sitka spruce. however, this aspect remains to be further tested in more details globally.

sp statistics and gene dispersal distance
in agreement with the sgs results estimated using smouse and peakall's  <cit>  autocorrelation coefficient method, average value for sp statistic was also higher in peripheral than in core populations of eastern white cedar. vekemans and hardy  <cit>  reported significantly higher levels of sp value in populations with low density as compared to the populations with high density. since the density of trees in the peripheral populations was much lower than in the core ones, the effect of density on the results of sp cannot be ruled out. except in the population pa, sp values observed in the other three populations of eastern white cedar were higher than the average value observed in five wind-dispersed temperate trees  and  <dig> outcrossing plant species  <cit> . however, it was lower in eastern white cedar as compared to the average value  of seven mixed mating species  <cit> . de-lucas et al.  <cit>  reported higher sp values in fragmented than in continuous populations of another conifer species, pinus pinaster, and they explained that the lower effective population size due to few reproductive individuals in fragmented populations may have resulted in restricted gene flow via seed and increased the level of sgs in the populations. this explanation may also be applicable to eastern white cedar because the peripheral populations were highly affected by anthropogenic fragmentation. the average gene flow distance in eastern white cedar was higher in peripheral populations than in the core ones. higher gene flow distances would be expected in fragmented and peripheral populations than in core and intact populations because of lower tree density in peripheral populations resulting in lower obstruction for pollen movement  <cit> , which is the case in peripheral populations of eastern white cedar. in agreement with our results, vekemans and hardy  <cit>  also reported higher gene flow distances in low density populations than in populations with high density.

evolutionary potential and genetic resource conservation implications
the results of genetic diversity, ne and sgs comparisons in core versus peripheral populations suggest that the evolutionary potential of the studied peripheral eastern white cedar populations may have been adversely affected. the results of our study have significance and implications for conservation and management of genetic resources of eastern white cedar - a declining to endangered species in atlantic canada. for ex-situ conservation via seed and vegetative propagule collection, a minimum distance of  <dig> meters in peripheral and  <dig> m in core populations is advisable to capture maximum genetic diversity and avoid sampling genetically-related trees. the core populations in new brunswick should be conserved in-situ. both of the peripheral nova scotia populations have suffered genetic degradation as a result of extensive human disturbance and edge effect. here, both ex-situ and in-situ genetic resource conservation efforts supplemented with genetic restoration will be required given that eastern white cedar is a red-listed species in nova scotia. the results of our study are relevant for within-population sampling of individuals for population genetic studies in this species. the results may also be applicable for conservation and management of genetic resources of other long-lived, declining species with similar mixed-mating characteristics.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results clearly demonstrate that the studied eastern white cedar populations have significant fine-scale genetic structure at short distances. peripheral populations have several-folds higher within-population fine-scale genetic structure than core populations. vegetative propagation does not apparently contribute to sgs in eastern white cedar. anthropogenic disturbances and fragmentation presumably have significant effects on fine-scale genetic structure in eastern white cedar. the magnitude of evolutionary forces such as founder effect, genetic drift, gene flow and selection, operating in core versus peripheral populations is likely to be different. this may be the first report comparing sgs in intact core versus fragmented peripheral populations of a long-lived, mixed-mating declining plant. the results of our study contribute to the knowledge of poorly-understood spatial genetic structure of core versus peripheral populations in plants.
