BACKGROUND
the expansion of gene families in particular evolutionary groups as well as in single lineages significantly contributes to different aspects of genome innovation. however, not all classes of genes undergo equal rate of expansion. genes controlling basic cellular functions, such as dna modification, cytoskeletal organization, protein and rna metabolism are remarkably conserved both in sequence and copy number across large evolutionary distances  <cit> . other functional categories progressively expand during evolution, with mode and tempo of this expansion largely depending on the effects on organism fitness. genes coding for structural proteins and those controlling pathogen and stress response usually undergo lineage or organism specific expansions  <cit> . in these cases environment-dependent regulation of gene dosage and expression is required. genes coding for adhesion molecules, extracellular signalling or those involved in gene regulation expand preferentially during transitions towards higher complexity, defined as increase in cell types  <cit> . the accretion of zn-fingers in vertebrates is among the most positively correlated with increase in complexity  <cit> . the reason for the massive expansion of zn-fingers resides in the ability to bind dna and regulate gene transcription in a tissue or cell-specific fashion. how this specificity is reached after gene expansion remains still an open question. according to the widely accepted model of evolution by gene duplication  <cit> , in the first phases of their life novel genes are particularly free to change due to relaxed pressure acting on them. the most likely outcome is the acquisition of harmful modifications leading to loss of function . however, in very rare cases, novel genes can acquire advantageous mutations differentiating their function from that of the ancestor . in a third scenario, needed to explain the abundance of gene duplications and lineage-specific expansions, mutations may occur in both genes, ancestor and duplicate, that specialize in complementary functions   <cit> .

here we report a comparative analysis of the prdm genes in vertebrates with the aim of connecting the expansion of this family of transcriptional regulators to their progressive functional specialization. the results of this study also contribute to unravel the general principles that drive gene family evolution. prdm genes code for proteins controlling critical aspects of cell integrity, spanning from cell commitment and differentiation  <cit>  to cell growth and apoptosis  <cit> . these genes also play a role in human cancer, where they mainly act as tumor suppressors  <cit> . prdm proteins share a characteristic domain organization with an n-terminal pr domain followed by a variable number of zn-finger repeats. the only exception is prdm <dig>  for which no zn-fingers are detectable . the pr  domain is 20â€“30% identical to the set module, which is directly responsible for the catalytic activity of several histone lysine-methyltransferases  <cit> . some members of the prdm family show intrinsic methyltransferase activity  <cit> , while others play an indirect role by recruiting chromatin remodelling enzymes  <cit> . the number and features of prdm genes in other species besides human are poorly known. except for mouse, most prdm orthologs in other organisms remain uncharacterized. such lack of information has so far prevented from clarifying the reciprocal evolutionary relationships between different members of the prdm family.

we started our analysis by searching for orthologs of the  <dig> human prdm genes in representatives of fully sequenced eukaryotic genomes. we assessed that, after their appearance in metazoans, prdm genes expanded in vertebrates and further duplicated in primates. by comparing the evolutionary features of prdm genes with their expression in human tissues, we detected a tendency of newer genes to acquire tissue specificity. slowly evolving paralogs also produce more abundant transcripts. we found that the massive structural rearrangements of primate-specific prdm <dig> gene greatly contributed to modify gene function. in particular, the duplication of an internal segment conferred peculiar splicing pattern to the new gene, with the gain of a novel intron or, alternatively, its retention in the mature rna.

RESULTS
prdm genes expanded in vertebrates and further duplicated in primates
by searching for prdm orthologs in a variety of eukaryotic genomes, we did not identify any prdm gene either in fungi or in plants, confirming that they first appeared in metazoans. in invertebrates, the orthology assignment yielded  <dig> genes for nematodes and  <dig> genes for arthropods . the additional sequence found in insects corresponds to hamlet, a transcription factor involved in dendrite morphogenesis  <cit> , and acting as negative regulator of s-phase entry in drosophila  <cit> . interestingly, also vertebrates prdm <dig>  <cit> , prdm <dig>  <cit> , and prdm <dig>  <cit>  are involved in cell cycle regulation. among vertebrates, we identified  <dig> putative prdm orthologs in primates and  <dig> putative orthologs in rodents, birds and amphibians . in fugu we only detected  <dig> prdm genes, as we could not identify the prdm <dig> ortholog possibly due to the presence of unresolved regions in the genome assembly.

our results highlighted the expansion of the prdm family in vertebrates. we tried to assess a possible timing for this expansion by checking for putative prdm orthologs in protochordates and other invertebrates. we were able to identify only  <dig> prdm genes in c. intestinalis , likely because of the poor quality of the ciona genome assembly. the retrieval of  <dig> putative prdm orthologs in the echinoderm s. purpuratus indicated that at least a partial expansion of the family preceded the last common ancestor of vertebrates . our data also showed that prdm gene expansion continued in primates, as one single rodent co-ortholog corresponds to the primate in-paralog pair formed by prdm <dig> and prdm <dig> .

expression pattern of prdm genes reflects their evolutionary relationships
we rebuilt the phylogenetic relationships between prdm genes based on the multiple alignment of the pr-domain of all prdm proteins identified in vertebrates . the trees obtained by applying both maximum likelihood and bayesian methods are topologically comparable and well supported, the only exception being the internal relationships within the subfamily composed of prdm7/ <dig>  prdm <dig> and prdm <dig>  overall, five subfamilies are clearly identifiable and the most divergent member is prdm <dig>  despite the large variability in terms of gene structure and size among human prdm paralogs, genes lying in sister branches of the tree maintain similar gene organization . such conservation partially reflects similar splicing patterns, as in the case of the subfamily composed of prdm <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  all these genes can code for both a full-length protein and an isoform without the pr-domain, which is often overexpressed in cancer  <cit> .

we observed interesting correlations between gene divergence and expression patterns. in human, all prdm genes are generally expressed at very low levels, as assessed by qpcr . however, substantial differences are detectable among the  <dig> paralogs in terms of breadth and levels of expression. by ordering the prdm proteins according to their evolutionary speed, we observed that less divergent paralogs are more expressed than faster-evolving genes . this result assesses a negative correlation between rate of sequence evolution and gene expression levels . in addition, some paralogs, such as prdm <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> acquire tissue specificity, since the corresponding transcripts are detectable only in very few of the analyzed samples . one of the youngest members of the family, prdm <dig>  shows an expression pattern mainly restricted to melanocytes, suggesting a progressive specialization and/or tighter regulation of its functions.

prdm <dig> arose from prdm <dig> duplication and acquired a peculiar splicing pattern
to rebuild the possible rearrangements following primate-specific duplication, we compared genetic and genomic features of the primate prdm <dig> and prdm <dig> genes with those of their co-ortholog prdm7/ <dig> in non-primates. we observed higher conservation of the genomic block around prdm <dig>  and higher similarity of human prdm <dig> gene structure and protein domain organization with the non-primate co-ortholog . these results suggest that prdm <dig> likely retained the features of the ancestral locus, while prdm <dig> acquired primate-specific features.

after segmental duplication, the new locus experienced massive rearrangements that significantly modified the structure of the resulting prdm <dig> gene . in human, the last exon coding for the zn-fingers underwent partial deletion and the resulting protein bears only  <dig> repeats instead of  <dig> . in addition, an 89-nucleotide long segment within ancestral exon  <dig>  which codes for the pr-domain c-terminal part, tandemly duplicated . this led to the acquisition of a complex pattern of splicing variants . interestingly, the duplication of the same 89-nucleotides occurred  <dig> times in the chimp genome . however, the possible effect of this repetition on gene splicing is unknown since no chimp mrna is available.

for human prdm <dig>  both a shorter  and a longer  isoform have been reported. in the latter, the corresponding protein add a n-terminal krab domain to the usual prdm architecture . meisetz, the mouse ortholog of the long prdm <dig> isoform, is able to activate the progression into meiosis through the trimethylation of the lysine  <dig> on histone h <dig>  <cit> . recently, the krab domain of meisetz has been proposed to be the ancestor of all modern krab domains, being traceable in the last common ancestor of vertebrates  <cit> . in principle the genomic locus of prdm <dig> could also code for a long isoform with the krab domain, but all mrna sequences so far available corresponded to the short variant. one of them  resembles the sequence of the short form of prdm <dig> implying that the duplication inside exon  <dig> is coupled with an event of intron gain . by using specific primers, we cloned the long isoform of prdm <dig> and found that it can retain the 89-nucleotide long duplicon within the sequence of the mature mrna . this retention introduces a frameshift, and the resulting protein replaces the zn-fingers with an alternative c-terminal region . to assess the frequency of the two prdm <dig> isoforms in human tissues, we amplified the corresponding region  in a variety of rna samples from normal tissues and cancer cell lines. in most cases, two bands of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp are detectable . sequence analysis of the rt-pcr products confirmed that the higher band corresponds to the prdm7-specific amplicon with retention of the internal duplication. the lower band could correspond to either prdm <dig> or prdm <dig> since the two genes have identical sequences in this region. the widespread detection of the isoform with the retained duplicon suggests that this might be a general mechanism to produce an alternative prdm <dig> protein without zn-fingers. interestingly, in mouse two isoforms of the meisetz gene generated by alternative splicing also lack the zn-finger repeats and code for a protein with only the krab and the pr domains  <cit> . by using several combinations of primers, we identified other long isoforms of prdm <dig> with alternative patterns of exon retention , but we did not retrieve the long isoform coding for the zn-fingers. one explanation could be that the long isoform of prdm <dig> with the zn-fingers is not produced. another possibility is that it is extremely rare, being detectable only in specific tissues and/or cellular phases. this is the case of meisetz, which is only expressed in fetal germ lines entering meiotic prophase  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the prdm gene family of putative tumor suppressors constitutes an interesting example of vertebrate-specific expansion of transcriptional regulators. except for prdm <dig>  all prdm genes code for a variable number of c2h <dig> zn-finger repeats and, although the precise molecular function is mostly unknown, the ability to bind dna seems to be a common feature. in addition, some of the prdm genes control transcription through either direct or indirect histone methylation  <cit> . thus, rebuilding the progressive specialization of the prdm ancestral function in different cell types and/or in diverse stages of development may yield general conclusions concerning paralog differentiation of transcriptional regulators in vertebrates.

prdm genes show an inverse relationship between sequence divergence and expression level. paralogs that evolve slowly, such as prdm <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> tend to be more expressed than faster-evolving genes like prdm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . although there is not a straightforward biological explanation for it  <cit> , this inverse correlation reflects an asymmetrical evolution of prdm paralogs and is compatible with their progressive sub- and neo-functionalization  <cit> . both slowly  and fast-evolving  paralogs show methyltransferase activity, which implies the repartition of the putative ancestral function among several duplicates. signs of neo-functionalization are also detectable, such as the different roles of pr domain in histone methylation and the specific involvement of prdm <dig> in meiotic progression  <cit> . the acquisition of novel functions is particularly evident in the primate-specific gene. as most newborn genes  <cit> , prdm <dig> underwent remarkable structural rearrangements. some modifications, such as the reduction of encoded zn-fingers, are recurrent within the prdm family , while the internal duplication of ancestral exon  <dig> is unusual for at least two reasons. first, the region undergoing duplication codes for the c-terminal part of the pr-domain, which is the only module always present in prdm proteins. usually, such well-conserved regions are under strong selective constraints that prevent harmful modifications. second, the ancestral 89-nucleotide long segment does not contain any repetitive element to justify duplication through replication slippage and/or non-homologous recombination. thus, the internal duplication seems to reflect adaptation of prdm <dig> to novel functions. the effect of the duplication on prdm <dig> splicing may constitute the first evidence for such adaptation. the duplication of a cryptic splice site  in the ancestral sequence results in the acquisition of a non-canonical splice site . this site can activate the splicing of an 89-nucleotide long intron partly deriving from the ancestral sequence and partly from the duplicon . such mechanism for intron gain was theoretically described by rogers in  <dig>  <cit> , but has so far been observed very rarely  <cit>  and never in human genes. the resulting mature mrna encodes for a protein with the usual domain architecture of prdm genes . we found that the duplicated segment can be alternatively retained into the mature mrna and eventually encodes for a frameshifted protein without zn-fingers . usually, the introduction of a frameshift is a dangerous event for a gene, and indeed mechanisms such as nonsense-mediated decay have evolved to prevent the generation of harmful proteins  <cit> . however, a few cases of genes duplicated in vertebrates that use frameshift as a mechanism to diversify their function have been previously reported  <cit> . the majority of these frameshifts originated through alternative splicing able to activate a different reading frame  <cit> . in the case of prdm <dig>  instead, the frameshift arose through the duplication of an internal sequence. as for the other reported cases  <cit> , also the mrna transcribed by the prdm <dig> gene is not a typical target for mrna decay. it is around  <dig> nucleotide long and can code for a protein with krab and pr domains and a c-terminal region of around  <dig> residues before encountering a stop codon . the isoform with the retention is detectable in most of the tested samples, and it is particularly abundant in melanocytes and melanoma cell lines . although more data are needed to confirm actual functional differences, one possible consequence of the lack of zn-fingers could be a modified cellular localization. the prdm <dig> isoforms without zn-fingers are indeed not able to reach cell nucleus  <cit> . in addition, the alternative c-terminal region of prdm <dig> shows no similarity to any sequence so far reported in sequence databases. it would be interesting to check whether this region is associated to the acquisition of any primate-specific function of the corresponding protein.
