BACKGROUND
the endogenous human gut microbiome has several important functions including nourishment, the training of innate immunity and the regulation of epithelial development  <cit> . although the escherichia coli population represents a rather small portion of the intestinal bacterial microflora, e. coli nonetheless occupy an important niche with regard to their close proximity to intestinal epithelium, wherein they utilize available oxygen and facilitate anaerobic growth  <cit> . intestinal microflora also prevent the growth of pathogenic bacteria, either by competing for nutrient sources, or through direct bacterial antagonism mediated by bacteriocins and bacteriophages  <cit> .

e. coli is a highly diverse species with respect to its gene content, phenotype and virulence  <cit> . based on different virulence factors, e. coli strains can be classified into three main groups: commensal, intestinal pathogenic and extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli   <cit> . commensal strains are commonly considered to be non-pathogenic. it has been shown that intestinal and extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli strains can develop from commensal strains by acquisition of virulence factors  <cit> .

intestinal pathogenic  e. coli is a typical mucosal pathogen which uses different pathogenic strategies including invasion of host cells , production of enterotoxins  and production of shiga-like toxins   <cit> . enteropathogenic e. coli  strains cause attaching-and-effacing  lesions and harbor the eaf plasmid  <cit> . diffuse-adherent strains of e. coli  are characterized by continuous adherence to eukaryotic cells mediated by afimbrial adhesins  <cit> , while entero-aggregative  strains produce an aggregative adherence  pattern  <cit>  when adhering to hep- <dig> cells.

expec strains carry different combinations of virulence factors. johnson et al.  defined expec strains as those possessing  <dig> or more of the following virulence factors: p fimbriae, s/f1c fimbriae subunits, dr-antigen binding adhesins, aerobactin receptor and group  <dig> capsule synthesis  <cit> .

another important characteristic of human e. coli strains is production of bacteriocins. colicins and microcins are antimicrobial agents with a relatively narrow spectrum of activity  <cit> . in general, microcins are known to have a wider spectra of antibacterial activity compared to colicins  <cit> . colicin js  <cit>  is unique in that it shares features of both colicins and microcins. the ecological role and molecular evolution of bacteriocinogeny are less clear but synthesis of bacteriocins may have both invasive and defensive functions in microbial communities  <cit> . bacteriocin production is a common feature of many probiotic bacteria. for example, microcins h <dig> and m are active substances produced by the non-pathogenic, probiotic e. coli strain nissle  <dig>  <cit> .

at the same time, several studies have shown an association between the production of some types of bacteriocins and pathogenic e. coli strains  <cit> . previous studies have found that genes encoding colicin e <dig>  as well as microcins h <dig>  m, i <dig>  e <dig> and v were associated with extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli strains  <cit> . colicin e <dig> is also known to have toxic effects on eukaryotic cells and is considered to be a virulence factor in upec strains  <cit> . microcins h <dig> and m are induced when iron is a limiting factor and are associated with competition for iron  <cit> . synthesis of microcin h <dig> and m could therefore be advantageous in bacteremia of urinary tract origin  <cit> .

previously published studies have only provided partial insight into the association between bacteriocin production and bacterial virulence, as they were primarily focused upon upec strains and differed in the number of detected bacteriocin and virulence genes. azpiroz et al.  screened  <dig> microcin types in  <dig> upec strains and  <dig> virulence factors  <cit> , while budič et al.  and petkovšek et al.  analyzed  <dig> virulence factors  and  <dig> bacteriocin types in  <dig> upec strains  <cit> . similarly, abraham et al.  analyzed  <dig> bacteriocin types and  <dig> virulence factors in a collection of  <dig> upec strains  <cit> . together, these studies identified an association between microcins  and several virulence genes  <cit> . studies by gordon et al.  and gordon and o’brien  focused on  <dig> fecal e. coli strains and identified an association between strains encoding at least one microcin type, and four genes involved in iron acquisition   <cit> .

the main aim of our study was to test the association between bacteriocin production and bacterial virulence within a large collection of e. coli strains  isolated from human gut microflora. in this study, new associations between bacteriocin-encoding genes and virulence determinants were found in human fecal e. coli strains.

RESULTS
detection of virulence determinants and bacteriocin-encoding genes
altogether,  <dig> dna determinants  encoding  <dig> different virulence factors were tested in each of  <dig> e. coli strains . the vast majority of strains  possessed at least one virulence factor. the most common virulence determinant was the fima gene , which was detected in  <dig> % of all strains.

genes encoding  <dig> bacteriocin types including  <dig> colicin types  and  <dig> microcin types  were tested in each of  <dig> e. coli bacteriocin producer strains. further, the prevalence of chloroform sensitive microcins h <dig> and m  <cit>  was tested in each of the  <dig> e. coli strains. the average prevalence of bacteriocinogeny in the set of  <dig> e. coli strains was  <dig> % . in contrast to other bacteriocin determinants, genes encoding colicins a, e <dig>  e <dig> and l were not detected in any producer strain. most of bacteriocin producers were strains producing two or more bacteriocin types .

association between bacteriocin and virulence determinants
we found that  <dig> % of e. coli strains possessing no virulence determinant  produced bacteriocins and 34% of the strains harboring one virulence determinant  produced bacteriocins. in addition,  <dig> % of e. coli encoding two virulence determinants  had bacteriocin genes and  <dig> % of the strains with  <dig> to  <dig> virulence determinants  were bacteriocinogenic .

a correspondence analysis  was performed using individual virulence determinants and bacteriocin-encoding genes . in addition to this two-dimensional representation, fisher’s exact test was used to analyze the association between bacteriocin types and virulence determinants. genes encoding aerobactin synthesis were  were significantly associated with genes for microcin v  and with genes encoding colicins e <dig> , ia  and s <dig> . the α-hly, cnf <dig>  sfa and pap virulence determinants were plotted together and were associated with genes for microcins h <dig>  and m . bacteriocin non-producers were associated with afai , eaea/bfpa , pcvd <dig>  and with strains in which virulence determinants were not detected  .

association between bacteriocin-encoding genes and e. coli pathotypes
based on the presence of virulence factors, e. coli strains were divided into three groups:  non-pathogenic  e. coli ,  diarrhea-associated e. coli  and  fecal e. coli with characteristics similar to expec, denoted expec in this study  . non-pathogenic e. coli were defined as those with no detected genes for virulence factors or those that only had the gene for fimbriae type i . diarrhea-associated e. coli strains encoded virulence factors typical for each of the diarrhea-associated pathotypes including eaggec , etec , eiec , epec , ehec  and daec  strains. all other strains containing genes for different virulence factors  and combinations thereof were classified as expec. the results of the correspondence analysis of individual virulence determinants and bacteriocin genes  showed that a majority of bacteriocin genes overlap with virulence determinants belonging to expec strains.

the occurrence of bacteriocinogeny  in nonevec strains  and in diarrhea-associated e. coli strains  was significantly lower than among expec  . in addition, a similar frequency of bacteriocin types was also found in both groups of nonevec and diarrhea-associated e. coli. among nonevec strains, those with a single bacteriocin gene were most common, while expec strains more often contained several bacteriocin genes in a single strain. compared to nonevec and diarrhea-associated strains, expec had higher frequencies of genes encoding microcins v, h <dig>  m  and gene encoding colicin e <dig> . in addition, compared to nonevec strains, expec had higher frequencies of genes encoding microcin b <dig>  and colicins ia , e <dig>  and s <dig> .

discussion
in this study, the average prevalence of bacteriocinogenic e. coli strains isolated from fecal microflora was  <dig> %. this value is close to the upper range limit seen in previous studies, where the prevalence of bacteriocinogenic e. coli strains varied from  <dig> to 55%  <cit> . however, these studies differed in a number of important ways including cultivation conditions and indicator bacteria used for detection of bacteriocin production and/or in the number of detected bacteriocin genes. older studies on the prevalence of bacteriocinogeny in fecal e. coli strains only focused on the identification of colicin production  <cit> . while Šmarda and obdržálek  used five different indicator strains to detect colicin production in the fecal e. coli strain  <dig>  <cit> , achtman et al.  used  <dig> indicator strains for the detection of colicin producers in a sample of  <dig> fecal e. coli strains  <cit> . more recently, gordon and o’brien  used pcr with  <dig> bacteriocin genes to screen  <dig> fecal e. coli strains   <cit> , and Šmajs et al.  detected  <dig> bacteriocin types in  <dig> fecal e. coli strains   <cit> .

our results have revealed that the frequency of bacteriocinogeny in e. coli strains positively correlates with the detected number of virulence determinants. bacteriocinogeny increased by as much as 75–80% depending on the number of encoded virulence factors. to our knowledge, this is the first time that the correlation between bacteriocinogeny frequency and the number of encoded virulence factors has been shown. this finding suggests that at least some bacteriocin-encoding genes should be considered as factors which increase the virulence of e. coli strains.

e. coli strains encoding only fimbriae type i did not show differences in the frequency of bacteriocinogeny compared to strains without genes for virulence factors. the role of fimbriae type i in development of human infections is not clear. although deletion of the fim gene cluster from virulent e. coli strain o1:k1:h <dig> attenuated virulence in the urinary tract infection  model  <cit> ; possession of fimbriae type  <dig> in e. coli strains from different sources was not found to correlate with the ability to cause utis  <cit> . several virulence factors, typical for diarrhea-associated e. coli strains, including pcvd <dig> , ial/ipah , eaea/bfpa  and afai  were not found to be associated with bacteriocin genes. bacteriocin producers therefore appear to be mainly associated with expec virulence factors . the occurrence of these virulence factors were associated with both chromosomally  and plasmid encoded colicin  and microcin types .

presently, several bacteriocins including colicin e <dig>  and microcins h <dig>  i <dig>  e <dig>  m, and v are considered virulence factors in extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli strains  <cit> . azpiroz et al. <cit>  and budič et al. <cit>  found an association between production of microcins h <dig>  i <dig>  e <dig>  m, and v and the distribution of virulence factors  in uropathogenic strains of e. coli; from these results they assumed that production of these bacteriocin types could contribute to development of bacteraemia. although different sets of virulence determinants and bacteriocin genes were used in these studies, our findings match with these observations.

we also found these associations between bacteriocin production and expec virulence determinants among human fecal e. coli isolates. moreover, we have found new associations between  <dig> bacteriocin types  and the expec virulence characteristics of human fecal e. coli strains. given that colicin ia and microcin b <dig> are known to be encoded on relatively large plasmids, it is possible that the association with more virulent strains is due to other genes being harbored on these plasmids, and not by colicin synthesis itself. however, colicin s <dig> was found to be encoded on a small plasmid   <cit>  that was similar to the colicin e1-encoding plasmid   <cit> . since these small plasmids do not encode virulence factors, colicin s <dig> appears to be a potentially important virulence factor and/or an important factor of resident e. coli strains.

the presence of virulence determinants  are associated with resident e. coli strains  <cit> . at the same time, expec strains causing extraintestinal infections like urinary tract infections and sepsis/meningitidis are believed to originate from the gut microflora. their virulence determinants including adhesins , toxins  and siderophores  appear to be important for e. coli strains to survive in the extraintestinal environment  <cit> .

on the other hand, we found that diarrhea-associated strains from our set of  <dig> fecal e. coli had a lower prevalence of bacteriocinogeny and a lower frequency of several bacteriocin producers. in addition, no specific bacteriocin types appear to be associated with virulence determinants that are typical for these strains. unlike fecal strains which have the characteristics of expec strains, diarrhea-associated strains are not considered to be resident human e. coli strains, which may explain the lower prevalence of bacteriocin genes.

in summary, bacteriocin synthesis is linked to strains with expec characteristics and appears to increase the ability of e. coli to reside in the human gut. moreover, at least several bacteriocin-encoding genes should be also considered as factors which increase the virulence of expec strains.

CONCLUSIONS
the frequency of bacteriocin-encoding genes was found to be positively correlated with the frequency of e. coli virulence determinants. e. coli with virulence characteristics of expec strains, i.e. strains encoding virulence factors s-fimbriae , p-fimbriae , cytotoxic necrosis factor , α-hemolysin  and aerobactin biosynthesis  were more often found to harbor genes encoding synthesis of microcins  and colicins  than other tested e. coli strains.
