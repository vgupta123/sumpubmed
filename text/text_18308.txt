BACKGROUND
the genomes of vertebrates are mosaics of isochores, long regions  that are fairly homogeneous in base composition. the isochores belong to a small group of families characterized by different gc levels   <cit> . in the human genome, a typical mammalian genome, five isochore families can be found  that cover a wide gc range   <cit> . the gc-richest families, h <dig> and h <dig>  represent approximately 15% of the genome, and contain about 50% of the protein-coding genes. this high gene density is accompanied by other striking properties, such as open chromatin structure, localization at the center of the nucleus, high density of short interspersed elements , low density of long interspersed elements , early replication, high level of recombination, high mutation rate, and higher expression level, while gc-poorer families have the opposite properties  <cit> . in the mouse genome, which is of interest in this study, the l <dig> isochore family is under-represented, compared to other vertebrates, and the h <dig> family is almost absent  <cit> . this narrow isochore distribution in the mouse genome has been interpreted as the result of a higher substitution rate  <cit>  and weak repair mechanism  <cit> , both phenomena reducing compositional heterogeneity . despite these differences, the distribution of genes is similar to that of the other vertebrates , and the average gc levels of the different families are remarkably conserved across species, reflecting a functional relation to the chromatin structure  <cit> .

the emergence of the isochores is an open debate of relevant evolutionary importance, where in addition to the selectionist model , other models attempt to explain the evolution of the isochores: the mutational bias  <cit> , the gc-biased gene conversion  <cit> , as also a unifying one  <cit> . despite the importance of this debate, our study is focused on investigating how base composition affects mammalian gene expression. such a relationship would provide additional evidence on a functional implication of the isochores, supporting that they are mainly a product of evolutionary adaptation  <cit> , rather than a simple by-product of neutral evolutionary processes  <cit> .

previous studies have investigated the effects of base composition on gene expression, both in human and mouse tissues, through an exhaustive use of expression data from techniques based on sequencing  and/or hybridization   <cit> , and despite some quantitative differences, agree that the expression levels of genes are positively correlated with the gc level. two recent studies  <cit> , through in silico compositional analysis of expression vectors and dna carriers, showed that aside from the gc <dig> level  of the coding sequences, the genomic compositional context in which a gene is embedded affects its expression. additionally, the human transcriptome map , using sage data, revealed domains of highly and weakly expressed genes  <cit> , namely the "ridges" and "anti-ridges", respectively. the former were found to be located in gene-dense, high gc-rich, and sine-rich genomic regions, while the latter were in regions with opposite properties  <cit> . the above reflect the partitioning of vertebrate genes into two types of genomic regions: the gene-rich regions , which correspond to the gc-rich isochores, and the gene-poor regions , which correspond to the gc-poor isochores  <cit> . in addition, when a similar to the htm transcriptome map was established for the mouse genome, the expression patterns were found to be conserved to that of the human genome  <cit> . next-generation sequencing  techniques revolutionized transcriptome analyses and, compared to previous transcriptome technologies, appear to be characterized by several advantages, i.e. a better dynamic range , better quantification of transcript levels and of their isoforms , identification of yet unknown coding and non-coding rna species  <cit> . moreover, ngs reduced the processing time and cost of sequencing by orders of magnitude, making it a more attractive tool in a broad range of research, for both dna and rna sequencing and for detection and analysis of genetic variability  <cit> . in this study, we took advantage of publicly available ngs data of three distinct mouse tissues  <cit>  in order to investigate the expression patterns across the isochores of the mouse chromosomes and the effects of the isochores' compositional properties on their expression activity. in the second part, we investigated the relations between genes' expression levels and their localization in the five isochore families for the three transcriptomes considered .

RESULTS
the results of aligning each tissue's reads to the reference mouse genome and to the coding sequences are shown in table  <dig> 

total number of reads in the dataset, number of successfully aligned reads per tissue, and number of reads aligned to coding sequences.

the transcriptome map of the mouse isochores and the effects of their gc level on their expression activity
additional file  <dig> shows the isochores' expression profiles for the three tissues along the whole genome, and illustrates a rough agreement of the expression levels and the gc level. one such example can be clearly seen on chromosome  <dig> . the choice of this chromosome is based on the fact that it also includes one of the very few h <dig> isochores of the mouse genome, the  <dig> mm <dig> . in the boxed areas in figure  <dig>  there is a clear agreement of peaks in expression and gc level, an agreement that can also be seen along most of the chromosome. to quantify this relation, we looked at the correlation between the overall expression activity of each isochore and its respective gc level, and found it to be quite strong .

it is well-known that in vertebrates, including the mouse, gc-richer isochores have higher gene densities compared to the gc-poorer ones . this is confirmed by the positive linear correlation we found between the gene density of the isochores and their respective gc level . having shown the positive effect of high gc levels to the isochoric expression and between gc levels and gene density, we also looked into the direct relation between the gene density and the expression level of the individual isochores. we found a positive correlation, with similar coefficients for all tissues .

in order to isolate and investigate the effects of the gc level on the expression activity of the isochores, it was necessary to eliminate the effects of the gene density. to this end, the normalized per tissue count of reads aligned within each isochore was normalized by the respective gene density of the isochore, and the log <dig> values were calculated . this approach limited our analysis to isochores containing at least one cds . as expected, we found that the percentage of isochores containing at least one cds increased as the isochore family gc level increased . notable exception to the trend is the h <dig> family, where an increase of isochores without any cds is observed. however, this increasing trend in h <dig> isochore is due to the fact that in the mouse genome the h <dig> icoshores consists of just nine isochores, two of which had no cds.

we then looked at the correlation between the expression level of the isochores, normalized by the respective gene density, and their respective gc levels of the isochores, and found it to be positive for all tissues .

summarizing, in this section, we initially presented the transcriptome map of the mouse isochores, and demonstrated an agreement between isochores gc level and their expression levels. finally, after gene density effects were removed from the isochores expression levels, we found a tissue-dependent correlation between the isochores gc levels and their expression activity.

isochoric localization of genes and their expression activity
in this section, we first investigated the relation between the isochoric localization of genes and their expression level. figure  <dig> shows each tissue's average genic expression level per isochore family. an increase in the average genic expression can be observed as the isochore family gc level increases . the only exceptions were the differences in average genic expression between the h <dig> and h <dig> families, in the liver and muscle, and between the l <dig> and l <dig> in the brain, found to be not significant . additionally, we found that the average genic expression of the isochore families in the brain differs significantly from that of the corresponding isochores in the muscle and liver , while between the two latter tissues significance was detected only for the l <dig>  and h <dig> families . this suggests that the expressed genes located in l <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig> isochores in the liver and muscle appear to maintain similar expression activity.

we then looked for differences in the distribution of the expressed genes in the isochore families against that of the genes that are not expressed. as expressed, we considered genes with at least  <dig> aligned reads to avoid possible noise from misalignments, while as non-expressed, we considered genes without any aligned reads.

first, we identified genes that did not have detectable expression in any of the three tissues covered by the dataset , and we found a very strong preference for them to be located in the l <dig> family , with decreasing presence in families of subsequently higher gc . this preference for lower gc isochores is clearly different from the distribution of the total coding sequences in the isochore families . it seems to agree with the proposition that low-gc isochores and gc-poor genes may be active during development, and are subsequently silenced in the adult stage . for the remaining  <dig>   <dig> , we looked into the isochoric distribution of genes that are not detected as expressed in only one of the three tissues . in overall, their distribution was quite similar; centred on the h <dig> family, and slightly skewed towards the l <dig> for the brain and towards the h <dig> for the liver .

looking into the distribution of the expressed genes in the isochore families, we found no differences among the three tissues . the percentage of expressed genes  progressively increases from low to high gc families, and peaks at the h <dig> family. regarding the h <dig> family, the massive drop observed is related to the extreme under-representation of this family in the mouse genome. repeating the analysis with a higher expression threshold  affects mostly the lower gc families, but overall it does not change the observed trend . with either threshold, the distribution is different from that observed for the non-expressed genes.

in this section, we showed that genes located in gc-richer isochores have a higher expression level than genes located in gc-poor isochores. moreover, we observed that, between liver and muscle, the genes located in l <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig> isochores appear to maintain a similar expression activity, contrary to the expressed genes located in l <dig> and h <dig> isochores. we also presented evidence that, in three adult mouse tissues, the non-detected as expressed genes are preferably located in gc-poor isochores, while the expressed genes are preferably located in gc-rich isochores.

discussion
as mentioned in the background section, the way base composition affects mammalian gene expression is an issue of prime practical and evolutionary interest and, although it has been a matter of debate, most studies agree that there is a positive correlation. the transcriptome of the mouse isochores for the three tissues , the positive correlation between the isochores' gc level and their respective expression activity , and the increase of the average expression level of genes as the gc of the isochores increases  support the existence of a relationship between expression level and base composition.

the herein reported correlation coefficients, between the expression activity of the isochores and their respective gc levels , are slightly higher to those reported in previous studies on mouse  <cit> , where the genes expression was correlated with their gc <dig> levels. moreover, the order in which the expression level in the three tissues is most affected by the gc level  agrees to those in  <cit> . finally, despite the virtual absence of h <dig> isochores in the mouse genome and the small number of l <dig> isochores, our coefficients were found to be similar to those of human, the latter containing both l <dig> and h <dig> isochores  <cit> .

in regards to the gc-poor localization of the genes that are not expressed in any of the three adult mouse tissues considered here, the notion that they may be implicated in developmental processes is supported by several studies. indeed, two recent studies  <cit>  identified, in the genome deserts of vertebrates, long-range conserved systems comprised of highly-conserved non-coding elements and their developmental regulatory gene targets. similarly, although in a different context, it has been shown that during the development of the mouse brain, most expression changes occur in the gc-poor and line-rich regions  <cit> , and that the genes expressed in the early development stages of the mouse have at-ending codons, unlike the genes expressed in later developmental stages  <cit> . genes rich in at-ending codons are expected to be typically found in gc-poor isochore families  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this work is the first where ngs data are used in order to establish the transcriptome map of the mouse isochores for three different tissues, and to investigate the effects of base composition on the expression activity. our results are consistent with previous ones, and further support the idea of a functional implication of the isochores in gene expression. we conclude proposing that similar compositional approaches, using ngs data from carefully designed experiments, may shed more light into the role of the genomic  and genic compositional properties in gene expression, in the context of specific tissues or biological processes, and reveal valuable information on the implicated regulation mechanisms.
