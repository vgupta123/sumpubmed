BACKGROUND
spinal cord injury  is a highly debilitating pathology that has irreversible impacts and results in functional lost. paraplegia remains one of the major complications after operations. the complex pathophysiology of sci may explain the difficulty in finding a suitable therapy. the traumatic mechanical injury to the spinal cord, that is incurred following blunt impact and compression, is called "primary injury"; it directly destroys various elements of the tissue  <cit> . normally, acute injury leads to chronic injury and this successive phase is called "secondary injury", that lead to further tissue damage and expansion of the lesion for many days to months  <cit> .

an effective treatment limiting the evolution of secondary damage is still missing. historically, administration of high-dose glucocorticoid steroid acutely after sci has been considered the standard of care, but there have been growing concerns that the modest neurological improvements seen with high-dose methylprednisolone treatment in injured patients are not worth the associated risks. therefore, there is a critical need to develop new pharmacologic therapies for treatment of sci.

excitotoxic damage due to excess release of neuronal glutamate is hypothesized to play a deleterious role in the pathogenesis of sci. glutamate is involved in fast excitatory transmission and plays important roles in neuronal function such as plasticity and cognitive processes, as well as in toxic events  <cit> . it is stored in synaptic vesicles and released by calcium -dependent exocytosis in the white matter of the brain  <cit> . moreover, glutamate also activates n-methyl d-aspartate  receptors in oligodendrocytes. increasing evidences suggest that these receptors may be a novel therapeutic target for preventing white matter pathology  <cit> . the nmda receptors are opened or closed in response to the binding of a chemical messenger. these receptors are most abundant in the cortex, basal ganglia, in the sensory pathways of the nervous system, but has also been identified in a variety of non-neuronal and peripheral locations  <cit> . five nmda receptor subunits are expressed in the brain  <cit> : the nr <dig> subunit is necessary for channel function; instead the nr <dig> subunits have long c-terminal tails serving as anchoring points for signal transduction enzymes  <cit> . the channel pore is normally blocked by mg2+ to prevent ion flux  <cit> ; during "secondary injury"  <cit> , characterized by an excessive stimulation of glutamate, the mg2+ blockade is removed causing the opening of the receptor channel and the release of ca2+ within myelin with changes in dendrite structure and disruption of the processes of oligodendrocytes  <cit> . in addition, the overstimulation of glutamate receptors is toxic either to neuron and glial cells and participates in processes culminating in programmed cell death  <cit> .

dizocilpine maleate  is a potent non competitive nmda receptor antagonist that blocks the excitotoxic sequel of ischemia in tissue cultures and animal models of cerebral ischemia, reduces infarct size, and improves neurological outcome  <cit> . the efficacy of several nmda antagonist drugs have been studied in various models of ischemic spinal cord injury  <cit> , contusive sci  <cit>  or in ischemic lesions of rat spinal cord  <cit> , but studies using the acute clip compression model of spinal cord, that simulates human injury, are limited and related only to the recovery and neuronal death  <cit> .

thus the purpose of this study was to examine the potential contributory factors and molecular aspects of glutamate receptors that may play a role in excitotoxic cell death during sci.

in particular, we demonstrated that the administration of mk <dig>   <dig> min and  <dig> hours after injury, attenuated the degree of spinal cord injury; nuclear factor-kappa b  activation; pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes; mapk activation; proliferation of t cells; and apoptosis. interestingly, it restored the levels of neurotrophins.

 <dig>  methods
 <dig>  animals
male adult cd <dig> mice  were used for all studies. mice were housed in individual cages  and maintained under 12: <dig> light-dark cycle at  <dig> ± 1°c and  <dig> ± 5% humidity. the animals were acclimated to their environment for  <dig> wk and had ad libitum access to tap water and standard rodent standard diet. all animal experiments complied with regulations in italy , europe  and usa . all behavioral testing was conducted in compliance with the nhi laboratory animal care guidelines and with protocols approved by the institutional animal care and use committee . the study was approved by the university of messina review board for the care of animals.

 <dig>  sci
mice were anesthetized using chloral hydrate . we used the clip compression model described by rivlin and tator  <cit>  and produced sci by extradural compression of a section of the spinal cord exposed via a four-level t5-t <dig> laminectomy. with the aneurysm clip applicator oriented in the bilateral direction, an aneurysm clip with a closing force of  <dig> g was applied extradurally at t6-t <dig> level. the clip was then rapidly released with the clip applicator, which caused spinal cord compression. in the injured groups, the cord was compressed for  <dig> min. following surgery,  <dig>  cc of saline was administered subcutaneously in order to replace the blood volume lost during the surgery. during recovery from anesthesia, the mice were placed on a heating pad and covered with a warm towel. the mice were singly housed in a temperature-controlled room at 27°c for a survival period of  <dig> hours. food and water were provided to the mice ad libitum. during experimental period, the animal's bladders were manually voided twice a day until the mice were able to regain normal bladder function. sham-injured animals were only subjected to laminectomy. spinal cord tissues were taken at  <dig> h following trauma. tissue segments contained the lesion , in according to counts of retrogradely labeled neurons at the origin of distinct descending motor pathways and to morphometric assessments of normal residual tissue at the injury epicenter, as previously described by joshi and fehlings  <cit> .

 <dig>  experimental groups
mice were randomly assigned to the following groups:

sci+vehicle group : mice were subjected to sci plus administration of saline ;

sci +mk <dig> group : as the sci + vehicle group but in which mk <dig> at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg was administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after surgical procedures;

sham+vehicle group : mice were subjected to the surgical procedures as the above groups except that the aneurysm clip was not applied  and they were treated i.p. with saline ;

sham+mk <dig> group : identical to sham+ vehicle group except that mk <dig> was administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after laminectomy. the use of this "therapeutic time window" in mice  is related to blunt the changes of extracellular ionic levels after injury  and to block the post-traumatic cascade at several sites . the dose of mk <dig> used here was based on a previous dose-response study in our laboratory. mk <dig>  were dissolved in physiological saline.

 <dig>  grading of motor disturbance
the motor function of mice subjected to compression trauma was assessed once a day for  <dig> days after injury. recovery from motor disturbance was graded using the basso mouse scale  open-field score  <cit> , since the bms has been shown to be a valid locomotor rating scale for mice. the evaluations were made by two blind observers for all analyzed groups. briefly, the bms is a nine-point scale that provides a gross indication of locomotor ability and determines the phases of locomotor recovery and features of locomotion. the bms scale ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> , rating locomotion on aspects of hind limb function such as weight support, stepping ability, coordination, and toe clearance. the bms score was determined for ten mice in each group.

 <dig>  determination of myeloperoxidase  activity
mpo activity, an indicator of polymorphonuclear leukocyte  accumulation, was determined in the spinal cord tissue as previously described  <cit>  at  <dig> hours after sci. at the specific time following sci, spinal cord tissues were obtained and weighed and each piece of tissue was homogenized in a solution containing  <dig> % hexa-decyl-trimethyl-ammonium bromide  dissolved in  <dig> mm potassium phosphate buffer  and centrifuged for  <dig> min at  <dig>  × g at 4°c. an aliquot of the supernatant was then allowed to react with a solution of  <dig>  mm tetra-methyl-benzidine and  <dig>  mm h2o <dig>  the rate of change in absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at  <dig> nm. mpo activity was defined as the quantity of enzyme degrading  <dig> μmol of peroxide min at 37°c and was expressed as units of mpo/mg of proteins.

 <dig>  elisa measurement of tnf-α and il-1β
the measurement of cytokines levels,  <dig> cm sample containing the lesion site , was rapidly dissected and homogenized in  <dig> ml pbs containing protease inhibitors . tnf-α and il-1β levels were assayed using duoset elisa development system . all assays were carried out in duplicate using recommended buffers, diluents and substrates. absorbency was determined using a microplate reader at  <dig> nm . the intra-assay coefficient of variations for both assays was less than 10%. the concentration of the cytokines in the tissue was mentioned as pg/ <dig> mg wet tissue.

 <dig>  light microscopy
at  <dig> hours after spinal cord injury the animals were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with  <dig>  mol/l phosphate-buffered saline , followed by paraformaldehyde in  <dig>  mol/l in phosphate-buffered saline as previously described  <cit> . tissue segments containing the lesion  were paraffin embedded and cut into  <dig> μm-thick sections. tissue sections  were deparaffinised with xylene, stained with haematoxylin/eosin , or with silver impregnation for reticulum and studied using light microscopy . the segments of each spinal cord were evaluated by an experienced histopathology. damaged neurons were counted and the histopathology changes of the gray matter were scored on a 6-point scale  <cit> :  <dig>  no lesion observed,  <dig>  gray matter contained  <dig> to  <dig> eosinophilic neurons;  <dig>  gray matter contained  <dig> to  <dig> eosinophilic neurons;  <dig>  gray matter contained more than  <dig> eosinophilic neurons;  <dig>  small infarction ;  <dig>  moderate infarction; ;  <dig>  large infarction . the scores from all the sections from each spinal cord were averaged to give a final score for individual mice. the sections were also submitted to silver impregnation. all the histological studies were performed in a blinded fashion.

 <dig>  immunohistochemical localization of tumor necrosis factor -α, interleukin - <dig>  inos, cox- <dig>  nitrotyrosine, cd30/cd30l, cd <dig>  cd <dig> alpha/beta, fas ligand
at  <dig> h after sci, the tissues were fixed in 10%  pbs-buffered formaldehyde and  <dig> μm sections were prepared from paraffin embedded tissues. after deparaffinization, endogenous peroxidase was quenched with  <dig> %  hydrogen peroxide in 60%  methanol for  <dig> min. the sections were permeabilized with  <dig> %  triton x- <dig> in pbs for  <dig> min. non-specific adsorption was minimized by incubating the section in 2%  normal goat serum in pbs for  <dig> min. endogenous biotin or avidin binding sites were blocked by sequential incubation for  <dig> min with biotin and avidin , respectively. sections were incubated overnight with anti-tnf-α , anti-il-1β polyclonal antibody , anti-cox- <dig>  anti-inos , anti-nitrotyrosine rabbit polyclonal antibody , anti-cd <dig> mab , anti-cd <dig> ligand mab , anti-cd <dig> , anti-cd <dig> alpha , anti-cd <dig> beta , and anti-fas-ligand antibody abcam,1: <dig> in pbs, v/v). sections were washed with pbs, and incubated with secondary antibody. specific labeling was detected with a biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit igg and avidin-biotin peroxidase complex . to verify the binding specificity for nitrotyrosine, tnf-α, fasl, inos, bax, and bcl- <dig>  some sections were also incubated with only the primary antibody  or with only the secondary antibody . in these situations no positive staining was found in the sections indicating that the immunoreactions were positive in all the experiments carried out. immunocytochemistry photographs  of the perilesional area were assessed as previously described  <cit>  by densitometry using optilab graftek software on a macintosh personal computer.

 <dig>  western blot analysis
cytosolic and nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described  <cit>  with slight modifications. briefly, spinal cord tissues from each mouse were suspended in extraction buffer a containing  <dig>  mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride ,  <dig>  μm pepstatin a,  <dig> μm leupeptin,  <dig> mm sodium orthovanadate, homogenized at the highest setting for  <dig> min, and centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> min at 4°c. supernatants represented the cytosolic fraction. the pellets, containing enriched nuclei, were re-suspended in buffer b containing 1% triton x- <dig>   <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm tris-hcl ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm ethylene glycol-bis-n, n, n', n'-tetraacetic acid ,  <dig> mm ethylene diamine-tetra-acetic acid ,  <dig>  mm pmsf,  <dig> μm leupeptin,  <dig>  mm sodium orthovanadate. after centrifugation  <dig> min at  <dig>  × g at 4°c, the supernatants containing the nuclear protein were stored at -80°c for further analysis. the levels of iκb-α, phospho-nf-κb p <dig> , n-nos, p-erk1/ <dig>  p-p <dig>  cox- <dig>  brain-derived neurotrophic factor  and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor , were quantified in cytosolic fractions from spinal cord tissue collected  <dig> h after sci, while nf-κb p <dig> levels were quantified in nuclear fractions. the filters were blocked with  <dig> × pbs, 5%  non fat dried milk  for  <dig> min at room temperature and subsequently probed with specific abs anti-iκb-α , anti-nf-κb p <dig> , anti-phospho-p <dig> , phospho-nf-κb p <dig>  , or anti-p-erk1/ <dig> , anti-nnos , anti-cox- <dig> , anti-bdnf , and anti-gdnf  in  <dig> × pbs, 5% w/v non fat dried milk,  <dig> % tween- <dig>  at 4°c, overnight. membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated bovine anti-mouse igg secondary antibody or peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit igg  for  <dig> h at room temperature. to ascertain that blots were loaded with equal amounts of proteic lysates, they were also incubated in the presence of the antibody against α-tubulin or lamin a/c . signals were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence detection system reagent according to manufacturer's instructions . the relative expression of the protein bands of ikb-a , phospho-nf-κb p <dig>  , nf-kb p <dig> , inos , nnos , cox- <dig> , phospho-p <dig> , bdnf , and gdnf  was quantified by densitometry with imagequant tl software  and standardized to α-tubulin or lamin a/c levels. images of blot signals  were imported to analysis software . a preparation of commercially available molecular weight markers  consisting of proteins of molecular weight  <dig> to  <dig> kda was used to define molecular weight positions and as reference concentrations for each molecular weight.

 <dig>  terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated utp end labeling  assay
tunel assay was conducted by using a tunel detection kit according to the manufacturer's instruction . sections were incubated with  <dig> μg/ml proteinase k for  <dig> min at room temperature and then washed with pbs. endogenous peroxidase was inactivated by 3% h2o <dig> for  <dig> min at room temperature and then washed with pbs. sections were immersed in terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase  buffer containing deoxynucleotidyl transferase and biotinylated dutp in tdt buffer, incubated in a humid atmosphere at 37°c for  <dig> min, and then washed with pbs. the sections were incubated at room temperature for  <dig> min with anti-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody, and the signals were visualized with diaminobenzidine. the number of tunel positive cells/high-power field was counted in  <dig> to  <dig> fields for each coded slide.

RESULTS
 <dig>  mk <dig> treatment reduces the severity of spinal cord trauma
the severity of the trauma at the level of the perilesional area, assessed by the presence of edema as well as alteration of the white matter and infiltration of leukocytes, was evaluated  <dig> h after injury by hematoxylin/eosin  staining. the severity of trauma in the perilesional area, assessed by presence of edema and white matter alteration , was evaluated  <dig> h after injury. important damage was observed in spinal cord tissue from sci mice, when compared to sham-operated mice . notably, protection against injury was observed in sci-operated mice that have been treated with mk801at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after trauma . moreover, to evaluate the severity of the trauma we also observed the alteration in the reticular and nervous fibers tissues structure by silver impregnation. a normal presence of reticular and nervous fibers was observed in the spinal cord section from sham-operated mice . on the contrary, an alteration of reticular and nervous fibers was detected in the spinal cord tissues collected at  <dig> hours after sci . treatment with mk801at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after trauma reduced the alteration of reticular and nervous fibers associated with sci . in order to evaluate if histological damage to the spinal cord was associated with a loss of motor function, the bms locomotors rating scale score was evaluated. while motor function was only slightly impaired in sham mice , mice subjected to sci had significant deficits in movement . mk <dig> treatment at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after trauma significantly ameliorated the functional deficits induced by sci .

 <dig>  effect of mk <dig> on iκb-α degradation, phosphorylation of p <dig> on ser <dig>  nf-κb p65
most inflammatory mediators, including inos, il-1β and tnf-α are controlled by nf-κb, a transcription factor important in inflammatory process, which is kept inactive by iκb  <cit>  in the cytosol. by western blot analysis, we evaluated iκb-α degradation, the phosphorylation of ser <dig> on the nf-κb subunit p <dig> and nuclear nf-κb p <dig> to investigate the cellular mechanisms by which treatment with mk <dig> may attenuate the development of sci. a basal level of iκb-α was detected in the spinal cord homogenates from sham-operated animals, whereas sci mice showed reduced iκb-α level . mk <dig> treatment at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after trauma reduced the sci-induced iκb-degradation . moreover, sci caused a significant increase in the phosphorylation of nf-κb p <dig> on ser <dig> at  <dig> h after the injury; instead the treatment with mk <dig> at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after trauma reduced significantly the phosphorylation of nf-κb p <dig> on ser <dig> . in addition, the levels of the nf-κb p <dig> in the nuclear extracts from the spinal cord tissue were also significantly increased at  <dig> h after sci compared with the sham-operated mice. mk <dig> treatment at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after trauma significantly reduced the levels of nuclear nf-κb p <dig> protein as shown in figure 2c and 2c <dig> 

 <dig>  mk <dig> modulates cytokines expression and neutrophil infiltration after sci
to test whether mk <dig> modulates the inflammatory process through the regulation of secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, we analyzed spinal cord tissue levels of tnf-α and il-1β. a substantial increase in tnf-α and il-1β production was found in spinal cord tissues samples collected from sci mice  <dig> h after sci . spinal cord levels of tnf-α and il-1β were significantly attenuated in sci-operated mice that have been treated with mk <dig> at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after trauma . similarly, at  <dig> h after sci, expression of tnf-α and il-1β in the spinal cord tissues were determined by the immunohistological staining . spinal cord sections obtained from sham-operated mice did no stain either for tnf-α and il-μ . a substantial increase in tnf-α  and il-1β  expression was observed in spinal cord section obtained at  <dig> h after sci, while mk <dig> treatment at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after trauma significantly reduced the degree of positive staining for these pro-inflammatory cytokines . the histological pattern of spinal cord injury seemed to be correlated with the influx of leukocytes into the spinal cord. therefore, we investigated the effect of the treatment of mk <dig> on the infiltration of neutrophils by measuring myeloperoxidase  that is a lysosomal protein stored in azurophilic granules of the neutrophil . mpo activity was significantly elevated in the spinal cord at  <dig> h after injury in mice subjected to sci when compared with sham-operated mice. the treatment with mk <dig> at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after trauma significantly reduced the neutrophils infiltration in the spinal cord tissues at  <dig> h after the trauma .

 <dig>  mk <dig> modulates the expression of nitrotyrosine, inos, and nnos after sci
to determine the role of nitric oxide  produced during sci, twenty-four hours after trauma inos expression, and nitrotyrosine, a specific marker of nitrosative stress, were determined by immunohistochemical analysis in the spinal cord sections. spinal cord sections from sham-operated mice did not stain either for inos, and nitrotyrosine , whereas spinal cord sections obtained from sci-operated mice exhibited positive staining for inos , and nitrotyrosine . the positive staining was mainly localized in various inflammatory cells in the white matter. mk <dig> treatment at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after trauma was able to reduce the degree of positive staining for inos , and nitrotyrosine  in the spinal cord at  <dig> h after trauma. to better characterize the degree of spinal cord injury, we also evaluated by western blot analysis the level of neuronal nitric oxide synthase  protein. in spinal cord sections obtained at  <dig> hours, we observed basal levels of nnos in sham group ; a significant increase in the level of nnos protein was found twenty-four hours after spinal cord compression. the treatment with mk <dig> at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after trauma significantly influences nnos levels .

 <dig>  effects of mk <dig> on cox- <dig> expression after sci
spinal cord sections from sham-operated mice did not stain for cox- <dig> , whereas spinal cord sections obtained from sci mice exhibited positive staining for cox- <dig>  mainly localized in inflammatory cells in the white and gray matter of the spinal cord tissues. mk <dig> treatment at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after trauma reduced the degree of positive staining for cox- <dig>  in the spinal cord.

moreover,  <dig> h after sci, the changes in expression of cox- <dig> were also confirmed by western blot. cox- <dig> levels were appreciably increased in the spinal cord from mice subjected to sci . on the contrary, mk <dig> treatment at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after trauma reduced the sci-induced cox- <dig> expression at basal level .

 <dig>  mk <dig> reduces the expression of p-erk1/ <dig>  and p-p <dig> after sci
to investigate signaling cascades by which treatment with mk <dig> may attenuate the development of spinal cord injury, we also evaluated the activation of erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> by phosphorylation by western blot analysis. moreover, p <dig> mapk has been implicated as a critical mediator that positively regulates the expression of a variety of genes involved in the acute phase response. in spinal cord homogenates at  <dig> h after sci a significant increase in p-erk1/ <dig> levels were observed in sci-operated mice . treatment of mice with mk <dig> at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after trauma significantly reduced the level of p-erk1/ <dig> . moreover, pospho-p <dig> levels significantly increase after sci . mk <dig> treatment at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after trauma significantly decreased the expression of p-p <dig> .

 <dig>  effect of mk <dig> on fas-ligand expression and apoptosis in spinal cord after injury
immunohistological staining for fas ligand  in the spinal cord was also determined  <dig> h after injury. spinal cord sections from sham-operated mice groups did not stain for fasl , whereas spinal cord sections obtained from sci mice exhibited positive staining for this transmembrane protein in several inflammatory cells of the gray and white matter . treatment of mice with mk <dig> at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after trauma reduced the degree of positive staining for fasl in the spinal cord sections . moreover, to test whether spinal cord damage was associated to cell death by apoptosis, we measured tunel-like staining in the perilesional spinal cord tissue. almost no apoptotic cells were detected in the spinal cord from sham-operated mice . at  <dig> h after the trauma, tissues from sci mice demonstrated a marked appearance of dark brown apoptotic cells and intercellular apoptotic fragments . in contrast, tissues obtained from mice treated with mk <dig> treatment at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after trauma demonstrated no apoptotic cells or fragments .

 <dig>  mk <dig> reduces cd <dig> and cd <dig> ligand expression
no positive staining either for cd <dig> or for cd30l in spinal cord collected from sham-treated mice . the spinal cord sections from mice subject to sci stained positively for cd <dig> and cd30l  mainly localized in infiltrating lymphocytes. in contrast, there was no staining for cd <dig> as well as for cd30l in spinal cord tissue from sci-operated mice receiving mk <dig> at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after trauma .

 <dig>  mk <dig> treatment reduce the t-cell infiltration
since the anti-inflammatory effect of mk <dig> may also be due to inhibition of leukocyte extravasation, we analyzed leukocyte infiltration by immunohistochemical staining for cd4+  and cd8+ α  and cd8+ β  t lymphocytes at the injury site. there was no staining for cd4+, cd8+ α  and cd8+ β t lymphocytes  in spinal cord obtained from sham-operated mice. whereas a substantial increase for cd4+ , cd8+ α  and cd8+ β cells  were observed in the spinal cord tissue collected from sci mice. mk <dig> treatment at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after trauma significantly lowered the degree of positive staining for cd4+ , cd8+ α  and cd8+ β  t lymphocytes.

 <dig>  effects of mk <dig> on neurotrophic factors
by western blot analysis we evaluated the levels of two important neurotrophic factors that are release by microglia and macrophages in the cns, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor  and brain-derived neurotrophic factor . we observed a basal levels of bdnf and gdnf in the spinal cord section obtained from sham-operated animals . on the contrary, at  <dig> hours after sci a loss of both neurotrophic proteins was observed in the perilesioned zone . the treatment with mk <dig> at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after trauma significantly restored the levels of bdnf up to that of uninjured mice. moreover, for gdnf expression it was evident a trend of increase after mk <dig> treatment at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered i.p.  <dig> min and  <dig> hours after trauma .

 <dig>  discussion
glutamate is released in the white matter in a range of pathological conditions, in particular in the sci, and has been thought to damage oligodendrocytes  <cit> .

sci induces lifetime disability, and no suitable therapy is available to treat victims or to minimize their suffering  <cit> .

in the acutely injured of spinal cord, an inflammatory response develops within hours after injury and is characterized by the infiltration of neutrophils, the activation of microglia and causes the death of a number of neurons  <cit> .

traumatic events, as sci or neuronal diseases, cause an excessive accumulation of glutamate outside cells and lead to an increase flux of calcium ions into the cells, via nmda receptor channel, with subsequent neuronal damage characterized by changes of dendrite structures and destruction of myelin.

the finding that an excessive accumulation of glutamate was generated following injury suggests that treatment with mk <dig> could attenuate the pathogenesis of sci. we confirm here that mk <dig> exerts beneficial effects on the development of spinal cord damage and ameliorates the motor disturbance, as reported by other research groups  <cit> .

accumulation and activation of inflammatory cells are initial events of tissue injury and are regulated at the transcriptional level. nf-κb plays a central role in the regulation of many genes responsible for the generation of mediators or proteins involved in secondary damage  <cit> . the balance between proinflammatory and prosurvival roles of nf-κb may depend on the phosphorylation status of p <dig>  and excessive release of glutamate play a central role in this process. in this study on acute sci we documented increased production of inflammatory mediators after sci. also changes in cox- <dig> expression were evident as previously indicated  <cit> . mk <dig> treatment reduced cox- <dig> expression contributing to the attenuation of inflammation associated to this model of sci.

generation of reactive oxygen species  also appears to play a critical role in the induction of neurological dysfunctions in the course of sci. it has been known that no is the initiator of tissue oxidative stress and promoter of the pro-inflammatory reactions in sci  <cit> . activation of the nmda receptor generates no  <cit> , and over-expression of nnos leads to the excessive production of no, which is the link between the excitatory amino acids and subsequent cell damage  <cit> . in this study western blot results have shown that sci-induced nnos expression was attenuated by mk <dig>  thus, the neuroprotective mechanism of mk <dig> involved regulating nnos expression.

glutamate triggers the production of no and superoxide, which can lead to the formation of peroxynitrite . furthermore, nitrotyrosine formation was initially proposed as a relatively specific marker for the detection of the endogenous formation of onoo- <cit>  that contributes to secondary neuronal damage  <cit> . we showed that the use of the nmda receptor antagonists mk <dig> reduced glutamate-mediated onoo- generation.

our results indicate that the glutamate released after sci activates erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> in the mouse spinal cord via nmda receptors. but the incomplete blocking of p <dig> phosphorylation by  <dig> mg/kg mk <dig> indicates that mapks, especially p <dig>  are also activated by nmda receptor independent mechanisms.

the extrinsic fas pathway is sufficient to induce complete apoptosis in certain cell types as well as oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia through caspase- <dig> activation  <cit> . in this study, we demonstrated the first evidence that treatment with mk <dig> significantly reduced the fasl positive staining.

moreover in the pathways of apoptosis, cd <dig> initiates a negative growth signal leading to apoptosis. in this study we demonstrated that mk <dig> is clearly able to blockade cd30-cd30l interaction, reducing inflammatory and apoptotic response.

moreover, it has been demonstrates the presence of specific high affinity glutamate binding site on the surface of human lymphocytes, cd4+ , cd8+ alpha and cd <dig> beta t cells. the presence of nmda receptors on the surface of this type of cells is linked with t cell function and is essential for t cell proliferation  <cit> . mk <dig> exert its anti-inflammatory effects inhibiting leukocytes extravasation at the injury site.

moreover, we also investigated the capacity of mk <dig> to enhance functional outcome and to reduce the spinal cord lesions associated to sci restoring neurotrophic factors. we focused our attention on the role of two specific neurotrophins, as bdnf and gdnf that were markedly decreased following induction of sci. the treatment with mk <dig> restored bdnf expression at basal levels and increased gdnf levels, showing that mk <dig> was able to promoting the initiation of neurotrophic substance after sci.

 <dig>  
CONCLUSIONS
unfortunately, all clinical tests of glutamate antagonists for neuroprotection have failed. the reasons for the failure of the nmda antagonists for example in stroke and traumatic brain injury trials have been extensively discussed  <cit> . in some cases, failure is attributable to class-specific factors.

however, a factor not easily addressed is the time between onset of injury and initiation of drug treatment. it is important that nmda receptors are blocked during the period when glutamate is released pathologically, such as during ischemia occurring secondary to spinal cord injury.

the preclinical literature indicates that efficacy with nmda receptor antagonists can be realized with treatment initiated up to  <dig> h after injury  <cit> , although the optimal timing may be shorter  <cit> .

nevertheless, nmda receptor antagonists remain an attractive target for treatment of acute injury, and clinical trials such as the fast-mag trial have demonstrated the feasibility of initiating treatment within  <dig> h of the onset of injury  <cit> , which should consent to a more rigorous evaluation of the neuroprotective potential of nmda receptor antagonists.

however, since the pathophysiology of spinal cord lesion is multifactorial and multiphase, effective treatments are likely to require the application of combined strategies  <cit> .

in conclusion, the current study provides evidence that mk <dig> was able to reduce all parameters involving in inflammation, axonal destruction and demyelization at the site of impact in spinal cord trauma. moreover, this study confirms the well documented neuroprotective effects of this drug and lend support to the potential importance of nmda antagonists as therapeutic agents in the treatment of acute sci.
