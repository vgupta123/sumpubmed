BACKGROUND
mitogen activated protein kinase  signaling cascade plays a vital role in conferring resistance to the sessile plants besides coordinating the normal growth and developmental cues. it is one of the primary and evolutionary conserved signaling cascades possibly derived from animal erk-related lineage  <cit> . a canonical map kinase pathway minimally consists of a three tier linear phospho-transfer module namely mapkkk-mapkk-mapk which connects diverse developmental and defense signals to the appropriate transcriptional response. mapks are phosphorylated at a conserved t-e-y or t-d-y motif by upstream mapkks which lead to their activation  <cit> . the downstream substrates of activated mapks include transcription factors, enzymes or other proteins both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus  <cit> . the sequences of arabidopsis mapk substrates contain serine or threonine followed by proline  which is considered as the minimal consensus motif for phosphorylation by mapk  <cit> .

the main illustrations about plant mapks come from eudicot plant arabidopsis which contains  <dig> mapks divided into four groups a-d  <cit> . groups a, b and c have the ‘tey’ motif, whereas group d contains ‘tdy’ motif between subdomains vii-viii, a characteristic feature of mapks  <cit> . the most extensively studied group a mapks from arabidopsis, atmpk <dig> and atmpk <dig> are central positive mediators of plant innate immunity  <cit>  besides priming plants for the subsequent infections  <cit> . group b mapk, atmpk <dig> acts as a negative regulator of plant systemic acquired resistance  <cit> . arabidopsis mapks are also known to control basic physiological and developmental processes ranging from ethylene biosynthesis and signaling  <cit> , stomatal development and response  <cit> , cortical microtubule function  <cit> , ovule development  <cit>  to senescence  <cit> .

the information about the mapk gene family, their function and regulation in economically important cereal crop rice  is still scanty compared to its model eudicot plant arabidopsis. rice has  <dig> mapks  ranging from molecular masses of 42–79 kda with conserved protein kinase domains i–xi and an activation t-loop of either tey or tdy motifs  <cit> . interestingly rice has more tdy motif containing group d mapks  than with the tey motif  which is in contrast with arabidopsis mapks. osmapks in tdy subgroup have three to four extra amino acid insertions near the activation loop as compared to osmapks of the tey subgroups. osmapks belonging to the tey subgroup have a c-terminal common docking  domain that functions as a docking site for mapkks, while members of the tdy subgroup lack this cd domain but have a relatively long c-terminal region  <cit> .

out of  <dig> osmapks in rice only a few have been characterized so far. for example osmpk <dig>  and osmpk <dig>  were shown to be induced by various biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . similarly osmpk17- <dig> , osmpk <dig>  and osmpk <dig>  were found to be involved in plant defense response  <cit> .

osmpk20- <dig>   is one of the important rice mapk members encoding a  <dig> amino acid long protein  <cit> . osmpk20- <dig> is composed of an n-terminal kinase domain  and an unusually long c-terminal extension region but lacks the common docking  domain. unlike most other plant mapks, the kd region of osmpk20- <dig> carries a tdy phosphorylation motif instead of tey, a sequence essential in mapk activation. osmpk20- <dig> has been classified as group d mapk and share the highest similarity with atmpk <dig>  <cit> . the osmpk20- <dig> gene, which has a strong basal level expression in untreated healthy leaves, remained unchanged upon challenging with wounding, jasmonic acid , salicylic acid , ethylene , nacl and sucrose. the expression was slightly up-regulated by abscisic acid , h2o <dig>  drought but more drastically by heavy metals and low temperature . however, osmpk <dig> expression was down-regulated at 37°c and by uv-c irradiation  <cit> . osmpk <dig> is also inducible by exogenous aba treatment and magnaporthe grisea infection and is associated with host cell death  <cit> . most of the studies involving group d members of rice mapks have been limited to mrna expression level and no interacting proteins have been identified.

in this study, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid analysis of osmpk20- <dig> to find out its interacting partners in order to gain more insights into the rice mapk pathway. defying the linear nature of mapk pathway, osmpk <dig>  was found to be an interacting partner of osmpk20- <dig> in yeast two-hybrid screens. further in vitro and in planta experiments confirmed the specificity of the interaction. interestingly, both the proteins were shown to enhance the plant immunity in tobacco against pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci infection. the two proteins were also observed to localize in the stomatal guard cells upon infection reflecting their possible role in stomatal defense. the current work showing the physical interaction between osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig> opens a new dimension to the mapk signaling research.

RESULTS
osmpk20- <dig> interacts with osmpk <dig> in yeast
a yeast two-hybrid  screen of cold treated  oryza sativa cdna library was initially performed to identify proteins that may interact with osmpk20- <dig>  after screening approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> transformants with osmpk20- <dig> bait, eleven positive clones were identified. sequence analysis of the clones revealed that one of them encoded an osmapk later identified to be osmpk <dig>  subsequently, a full length cdna clone of osmpk <dig> was isolated and cloned in both yeast ad  and bd  vectors. the interaction was validated by performing one to one protein-protein interaction between full length clones of osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig>  the interaction was also observed after swapping the vectors between osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig> .

since osmpk <dig> and osmpk20- <dig> interaction was positive on nutritional selection media  as well as with mel <dig> reporter gene expression, lac z reporter gene expression was confirmed by using onpg as substrate. ah <dig> strain of yeast cotransformed with osmpk <dig> and osmpk20- <dig> yielded a high β- galactosidase activity whereas the other transformants with combination of osmpk <dig> or osmpk20- <dig> and empty ad or bd vectors have low or negligible amounts of β- galactosidase activity as compared to the positive interactions .

the interaction between osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig> is specific
in order to prove that the interaction between osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig> is specific, a targeted one to one yeast two-hybrid assay was carried out for osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig> against the phylogenetically close members of osmpk <dig> and osmpk20- <dig> respectively. the close relatives of osmpk20- <dig> included osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk17- <dig>  all group d mapks and that of osmpk <dig> included osmpk <dig> and osmpk <dig> from group a and b mapks respectively  <cit> . the full length clones of osmpk20- <dig>  osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk17- <dig> in ad vectors were used for y2h analysis against osmpk <dig> in bd vector. similarly the full length clones of osmpk <dig>  osmpk <dig> and osmpk <dig> in ad vectors were used against osmpk20- <dig> in bd vector for y2h assay. in both the cases only the combination of osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig> either in ad or bd vector showed growth on nutritional selection media  reflecting the specificity of the interaction .

the group d mapks lack c-terminal common docking  domain that functions as a docking site for mapkks, instead they have a relatively long c-terminal region  <cit> . the next question asked was whether the relatively long c- terminal domain of osmpk20- <dig> is responsible for the interaction with osmpk <dig>  for this, the c-terminal  <dig> amino acid long stretch of osmpk20- <dig>  was cloned in ad and bd vectors and used against osmpk <dig> in a targeted y2h assay. also the portion of osmpk20- <dig> containing the first  <dig> amino acids of kinase domains  but lacking the c-terminal tail of  <dig> amino acids was also cloned in ad and bd vectors and used for interaction with osmpk <dig> in y2h study. in both the cases no interaction or a very weak interaction was observed suggesting the interaction is not solely mediated by long c-terminal amino acid stretch but requires a complete osmpk20- <dig> for efficient interaction .

confirmation of the interaction between osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig> using in planta co-immunoprecipitation and fret assays
to further confirm the interaction between osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig>  co-immunoprecipitation  assay was performed. osmpk <dig> with myc tag and osmpk20- <dig> with ha tag in pcambia <dig> binary vector were transiently transformed either independently or in combination  in nicotiana tabacum leaves by agro-infiltration. after 48 hours, the in planta expression of the respective transcripts was checked  and the proteins isolated were used for co-ip assay. the expression of the proteins used as input control was checked by immunoblot  with anti-myc and anti-ha antibodies tagged to osmpk <dig> and osmpk20- <dig>  respectively . immunoprecipitation of the isolated proteins was carried out using anti-ha antibody followed by immunoblot of the precipitated proteins using anti-c-myc antibody. osmpk <dig> was only detected in the anti-ha immunoprecipitates from proteins of co-transformed leaf tissues infiltrated with both osmpk20-4-ha and osmpk3-myc  reflecting the interaction of the two proteins .

the subcellular localization and subsequent co-localization of osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig> was performed in tobacco leaves by transient transformation using agro-infiltration method. osmpk20- <dig> tagged with cfp and osmpk <dig> tagged with yfp cloned in pbi <dig> binary vector system were transiently transformed into nicotiana tabacum leaves by agro-infiltration method. after confirming the presence of respective transcripts , the leaves were observed under confocal laser scanning microscope under appropriate absorbance filters to check the localization of the fluorescent tagged proteins. the proteins were found to be co-localized on the peripheries of the cells and both the fluorescent signals were completely superimposable upon merging the images . the fluorescence resonance energy transfer acceptor bleaching  method was carried out to obtain the in planta evidence for the interaction of osmpk <dig> and osmpk20- <dig>  the recombinant constructs of osmpk <dig> carrying yfp tag and osmpk20- <dig> carrying cfp tag were transiently transformed into tobacco leaves by agro- infiltration. cells were further analysed for fret-ab analysis. osmpk <dig> was found to interact with osmpk 20– <dig> in planta predominantly at the plasma membrane .

osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig> are not phosphorylation targets of each other
osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig> have three and one putative  sites respectively  which are considered as the minimal consensus motif for mapk phosphorylation  <cit> . hence it was sought to further examine whether the interaction between two proteins is followed by phosphorylation event. to address the problem, bacterially expressed tag-free osmpk <dig>  and his-tagged osmpk20- <dig>  were used for an in vitro kinase assay in presence of kinase buffer containing radiolabelled  atp. even though both the proteins could independently phosphorylate myelin basic protein  they failed to phosphorylate each other reflecting the interaction may not be leading to phosphorylation of either of the protein . interestingly, relatively strong phosphorylation of mbp was observed when both osmpk <dig> and osmpk20- <dig> were included together in the assay.

osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig> interaction show coordinated role in plant defense
it has been previously established that rice osmpk <dig> is involved in disease resistance response  <cit>  and osmpk20- <dig> is induced by magnaporthe grisea infection and is associated with host cell death  <cit> . also there existed a correlated gene expression of both osmpk <dig> and osmpk20- <dig> in rice under certain biotic challenges  reflecting a concerted role of these proteins in plant defense. hence, we sought to investigate whether the interaction of the two proteins affect infection in plants. for this, tobacco leaves were transiently transformed either with osmpk20-4/osmpk <dig> individually or in combination and were challenged with pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci. after 72 hours, leaves expressing osmpk20- <dig>  osmpk <dig> or both showed an increased resistance to bacterial infection in comparison to mock treated leaves . for controls, the leaves were independently infiltrated with agrobacterium strain gv <dig> carrying empty vector and infiltration medium  only. also the bacterial colony counting revealed that the leaves expressing both osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig> show more disease resistance in comparison to individual proteins . the observations indicate that the two interacting proteins act in a concerted manner in providing disease resistance response.

fluorescent microscopy of cfp tagged osmpk20- <dig> and yfp tagged osmpk <dig> showed peripheral localization of the proteins. but interestingly through preliminary image analysis it was found that both osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig> underwent transient translocation from the cell peripheries to the nuclei and stomatal guard cells following pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci infection . this reflects that osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig> besides being key players in general plant stress might have a role in stomatal defense.

discussion
in this study, we report the discovery of a novel interaction between two rice mitogen activated protein kinases osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig>  although the interactions of mapks with their upstream mapk kinases and downstream substrates are well known, there existed no previous report of two plant mapks physically interacting with each other. this finding adds one more, yet interesting dimension to the already complex plant mapk signaling cascade. osmpk20- <dig> is one of the elusive members of comparatively less studied but a very important rice mapk signaling component. osmpk20- <dig>  a group d rice mapk was initially characterized as oswjumk  <cit>  in various abiotic stresses. it was observed to be induced by cold and heavy metal stress but not by wounding or jasmonic acid . in another study high expression levels of osmpk20- <dig> were found upon infection by rice blast fungus  <cit> . in a quest to find the interacting partners of osmpk20- <dig>  we carried out a yeast two-hybrid  screening and identified osmpk <dig> as the potential interacting partner . the interaction was found to be specific as neither of them interact with each others phylogenetically close relatives . it was also confirmed that the unusually long c-terminal portion of osmpk20- <dig>  involved in upstream kinase interaction, is not solely involved in the interaction with osmpk <dig> . the interaction of osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig> was verified in planta by coip followed by fret assay . earlier two tobacco mapks, wipk  and sipk  were shown to functionally interact with each other during phytophthora infection  <cit> , but there was no report of direct physical interaction between two mapks. sipk identified as the kinase involved in regulating wipk gene expression, providing an indirect clue that mapks may interplay among themselves in regulating plant defense response.

the proteins were localized in the periphery of the cells which is in agreement with the observations made for arabidopsis atmpk <dig>  an ortholog of osmpk <dig>  <cit> . singh et al.  <cit>  in their report observed that osmpk <dig>  is localized both in nucleus and cytoplasm. the discrepancy in the localization of osmpk <dig> in both the cases seems to be due to the difference in the biological systems and the experimental procedures used. the use of different expression systems in these studies might be another reason for the differences in protein localization. also it is well known that map kinases follow a dynamic pattern depending on the physiological state of the cell and the nature of the protein they are interacting with  <cit> . however it can not be ruled out that co-localization and subsequent interaction of the two proteins may also occur due to overexpression owing to the fact that 35s promoter was used to drive the protein expression. the co-localization of the two proteins was deduced from merging of two individual fluorescent signals as documented for plant cdpks  <cit> . interestingly, positive fret assay indicated in planta interaction of the two proteins and the fret efficiency was observed in plasma membrane only. it may, therefore, be concluded that the two proteins interact on the cell peripheries. it is also known that omtk <dig>  a mapkkk from alfalfa plays a mapk scaffolding role by binding and selectively activating the alfalfa mapk, mmk <dig> and functions in activation of h2o2-induced cell death in plants  <cit> . it can also be speculated that osmpk20- <dig> acts as a scaffolding protein in binding and subsequently activating osmpk <dig> 

there existed a correlated gene expression of osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig> under biotic stresses in rice mpss database providing a hint of their concerted role in biotic stress . transient transformation of osmpk20-4-ha and osmpk3-myc in tobacco leaves individually showed marked decrease in p. syringae pv. tabaci bacterial count validating the observations made by song and goodman  <cit>  for osmpk <dig> . the results contradict the earlier observations showing negative role of osmpk <dig>  in modulating pr gene expression and broad-spectrum disease resistance  <cit> . however, recently osmpk <dig> was reported to positively regulate the ja signaling pathway and plant resistance to a chewing herbivore in rice  <cit>  also, a positive regulation of wipk and sipk genes against pseudomonas cichorii – a bacterial pathogen was shown in nicotiana benthamiana <cit> . resistance to the pathogen was compromised in the plants in which both the genes were silenced. as osmpk <dig> is the ortholog of wipk, transient expression of osmpk <dig> might lead to the increase in resistance against pathogen and hence positive role in tobacco defense responses. osmkk4–osmpk3/osmpk <dig> cascade is also shown to be involved in both positive and negative regulation of defense responses in rice  <cit> . our data suggests that the two interacting proteins act in a coordinated manner in providing disease resistance response against p. syringae.

plant mapks are known to exhibit a dynamic change in their localization while responding to biotic as well as abiotic stresses  <cit> . nuclei and stomatal guard cells are two important sites for generating potential combat machinery for the infection  <cit> . ozone treatment induced the translocation of arabidopsis atmpk <dig> and pep- <dig>  treatment of parsley cells induced the translocation and accumulation of pcmpk <dig> into the nucleus  <cit> . arabidopsis atmpk <dig> and heteromeric g-protein, gpa <dig> are known to act in a parallel signaling pathways during aba mediated stomatal closure  <cit> . in addition to having a role in stomatal guard cell movements, atmpk <dig> is involved in active prevention of bacterial infection through stomata. in consent with the above observations, the translocation of both osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig> into the nuclei and stomatal guard cells upon infection was observed. the concurrent movement of both of the proteins reflects a role of their interaction in generating stomatal defense response. the functions of osmpk <dig> and atmpk <dig> are conserved whereas osmpk20- <dig> acts as a translocation enhancing protein.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study a novel interaction between two mapks, osmpk20- <dig> and osmpk <dig> has been reported. the interaction is phosphorylation independent and requires the full length proteins for efficient interaction. the interaction is required for the coordinated plant defense response against bacterial pathogen, pseudomonas syringae and is also thought to play role in stomatal defense. overall, the addition of this new link into the already complex mapk pathway can further lead to understand the actual signaling mechanism behind various physiological responses.
