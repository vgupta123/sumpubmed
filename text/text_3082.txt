BACKGROUND
embryonic stem cells  are self-renewing, pluripotent cells derived from the inner cell mass  of a blastocyst  <cit> . their ability to expand clonally or differentiate into multiple tissues makes them an ideal model to study cellular development. escs have been used for preclinical drug screening, toxicity testing, cell therapy in animal models and developing models for rare diseases, such as fanconi anemia  <cit> . epigenetic changes in histone and dna methylation control cell commitment to a specific lineage  <cit> . therefore, understanding both the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms is important for successful regenerative therapy.

histone post-translational modifications  modulate the chromatin landscape by changing overall charge and by recruiting chromatin modifier enzymes, thereby facilitating gene expression/repression and dna repair. histone acetylation is associated with gene activation  <cit> . loss of h4k <dig> acetylation at promoters results in decreased transcription  <cit> . while acetylated histones are found primarily at promoters of actively transcribed genes, they can also be found throughout the active gene  <cit> . histone acetylation has been implicated to be important for the pluripotent cell state, as some hdac inhibitors have been shown to improve reprogramming efficiency of induced pluripotent stem cells  or maintain a pluripotent stem cell state. for instance, when valproic acid, an hdac inhibitor, is added only oct <dig> and sox <dig> are needed to reprogram mefs  <cit> . another hdac inhibitor, butyrate, was also shown to improve reprogramming efficiency and can also reprogram myoblasts . since hdac inhibition facilitates cellular ipsc reprogramming, histone acetylation may play an important role in pluripotency.

histone acetylation is bound by bromodomain-containing proteins. especially, acetylated histone h <dig> is bound by the double bromodomain proteins brd <dig>  brd <dig>  and brd <dig>  which possess histone chaperone activity, thus facilitating transcription through nucleosomes  <cit> . brds have also been previously shown to play a role in development. brd <dig> mutants are embryonic lethal, with brd <dig> null mouse embryos showing deficient neural tube formation  <cit> . similarly, brd <dig> mutants are also embryonic lethal, and in vitro experiments show that they are incapable of maintaining the inner cell mass  <cit> . recent study identified that deletion of brd <dig>  not brd <dig> and brd <dig>  disrupts the esc colony formation in both human and mouse  <cit> . brd <dig> also regulates esc self-renewal and the expression of pluripotency genes  <cit> . inhibition of brd <dig> resulted in commitment to the neuroectodermal lineage  <cit> . in addition, brd <dig> has been found to localize to and control the expression hox gene clusters in hek <dig> cells  <cit> . these double bromodomain containing proteins may have an important role both in esc self-renewal and development.

brd <dig> recruits the positive transcription elongation factor b , which induces the release of the promoter-proximal paused rna polymerase ii  <cit> . brd <dig> has also been shown to possess kinase activity and can bind the carboxy-terminal domain of rna polymerase ii to phosphorylate serine  <dig>  which facilitates elongation by recruiting splicing factors  <cit> . brd <dig> has been shown to facilitate transcription, after being docked by h3k9acs10ph/h4k16ac  <cit> . recent crystal structures showed that while the second bromodomain of brd <dig> binds most di-and tri-acetylated lysines, the first bromodomain of brd <dig>  specifically binds di-, tri-, and tetra-acetylated histone h <dig>  <cit> . another study using time-resolved fluorescence resonance energe transfer  found that the strongest binding of bd <dig> was observed for the tetra-acetylated h <dig> peptide and the di-acetylated h <dig> peptide with k <dig> and k <dig>  but weak binding was found for all mono-acetylated h <dig> peptide  <cit> .

even though histone ptms and their readers are known to be important during cell differentiation, the changes in their abundance have not been previously well studied. in this work we investigated the changes in the quantity of histone ptms during esc differentiation into neuronal cells using quantitative mass spectrometry  based proteomics. we found that the cell differentiation involves consistent rearrangement of global histone ptm abundance. in particular, we observed a reduction of doubly, triply and quadruply acetylated histone h <dig>  suggesting an increase in chromatin compaction, and possible gene expression changes. interestingly, the expression levels of brd <dig>  which recognizes multiply acetylated histone h <dig> n-terminal tails, were also reduced during differentiation. inhibition of the binding of brd <dig> to histone h <dig> using jq <dig>  a specific inhibitor for the brd family in escs, promoted cell differentiation, while disrupting the coordinated changes in the quantity of histone ptms. the genome-wide investigation using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing  against brd <dig> and histone acetylation at h <dig>  show that brd <dig> binds to the pluripotent and lineage specific genes in embryoid body  from escs, suggesting that inability of brd <dig> to read h <dig> acetylation may disrupt genome-wide acetylation landscapes. taken together, our results indicate that monitoring the epigenetic status through the interaction with acetylated histones is important for the maintenance of the pluripotency and the coordinated differentiation of escs.

methods
cell culture of mouse embryonic stem cells
cce nanog-gfp escs, a generous gift from ihor lemischka, were cultured in dmem supplemented with  <dig> % fbs, penicillin-streptomycin, non-essential amino acids, 2-mercaptoethanol, sodium pyruvate, and esgro/2i , as adapted from gaspard et al.  <cit> . cells were seeded on gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes at 2x <dig> cells per  <dig> cm dish and passaged every other day. cells were grown at 37°c in a humidified  <dig> % co2/ <dig> % air incubator. nanog-gfp was measured by facs  prior to experiments to verify that > <dig> % of cells were pluripotent. no ethics approval was required for this study.

retinoic acid differentiation
to differentiate escs, we applied the protocol described earlier  <cit> . to form embryoid bodies, escs were plated on petri dishes in esc media containing  <dig> % fbs and lacking esgro/2i. cells were incubated on a shaker at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> days, changing media on alternate days. embryoid bodies were grown for four more days in eb media containing  <dig> μm all-trans retinoic acid , changing media also on alternate days. ra-treated ebs were plated on gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes and incubated for a week, changing media every other day.

nuclei isolation and histone extraction
nuclei were isolated and histone proteins were extracted as described before  <cit> . briefly, histones were acid-extracted from nuclei with  <dig>  m h2so <dig> for  <dig> hours and precipitated with  <dig> % trichloroacetic acid  overnight. samples were resuspended in 20- <dig> μl of ddh2o and protein concentration was calculated using the bradford assay. histone samples were derivatized with propionic anhydride, digested with trypsin overnight at 37c and re-propionylated as previously described  <cit> . afterwards, histone peptides were desalted using c <dig> material.

reversed phase nano chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry
samples were analyzed by using a nanolc-ms/ms setup. nanolc was configured with a  <dig> μm id ×  <dig> cm reprosil-pur c18-aq  nano-column using an easy-nlc nanohplc . the hplc gradient was 2- <dig> % solvent b  over  <dig> min and from  <dig> % to  <dig> % solvent b in  <dig> minutes at a flow-rate of  <dig> nl/min. lc was coupled with an ltq-orbitrap velos mass spectrometer . full scan ms spectrum  was performed in the orbitrap with a resolution of  <dig>   with an agc target of 1x10e <dig>  the acquisition method contained both data-dependent and targeted scans. the targeted signals were the histone h <dig> and h <dig> peptides in isobaric forms, if any. ms/ms was performed with collision induced dissociation  with normalized collision energy of  <dig>  an agc target of 10e <dig> and a maximum injection time of  <dig> ms. ms/ms data were collected in centroid mode. precursor ion charge state screening was enabled and all unassigned charge states as well as singly charged species were rejected. all proteomics data has been deposited in the chorus database .

histone ptm data analysis
the selected modified peptides were quantified using label-free based extracted ion chromatography. epiprofile was used for the purpose, with a peak extraction mass tolerance set to  <dig> ppm  <cit> . the peptide relative ratio was calculated by considering the peak area of all peptides that share the same amino acid sequence as total peptide abundance, and estimating the percentage of each individual species by dividing the peak area by the total peptide abundance.

western blot analysis
cells were lysed using tne buffer . approximately  <dig> μg of cell lysate per sample were run on a  <dig> % polyacrylamide gel. the membrane was incubated with the primary antibodies  according to the manufacturers’ instructions overnight at 4°c. to determine the sensitivity of detection of the anti-acetyl h <dig> antibody , a dot blot was performed.  <dig>  μg,  <dig>  μg,  <dig>  μg, and  <dig>  μg of h <dig> peptides from the acetyl-histone peptide pack  were spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane.  <dig>  μg,  <dig>  μg,  <dig>  μg, and  <dig>  μg of hplc purified histone h2b from hela and escs were also spotted onto the membrane. the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody at a 1: <dig>  dilution for  <dig> minutes at room temperature. the membrane was incubated with secondary antibody at a 1: <dig>  dilution for  <dig> minutes at room temperature  then probed with ecl western blot substrate .

gene expression analysis
cells were homogenized using qiashredder , and rna was isolated using an rneasy kit . cdna was synthesized using a superscript iii first-strand synthesis system . qpcr was performed using power sybr® green pcr master mix  and the stepone real-time pcr system  according to manufacturer’s instructions. the qpcr primers used are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  primers for gapdh, oct <dig>  nanog, gata <dig>  col2a <dig> and brd <dig> were designed using universal probe library assay design center , while the rest were published earlier  <cit> . relative mrna abundance to gapdh was calculated by ddct method.

chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing 
approximately 4x <dig> cce escs and embryoid bodies were hypotonically lysed in tmsd buffer  containing inhibitors . nuclear pellets were resuspended in  <dig> ml micrococcal nuclease digestion buffer  containing inhibitors. micrococcal nuclease  was added to each sample  and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> minutes. the digestion was quenched by the addition of  <dig> mm egta. samples were pelleted, and the resulting supernatant was collected. the pellet was washed twice with bc <dig>  containing inhibitors, and the resulting supernatants were pooled with the first supernatant. mononucleosomes were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant overnight at 4°c using protein ag magnetic beads  bound to either anti-brd <dig> antibody  or anti-acetyl h <dig> antibody . the magnetic beads were washed three times with bc <dig>  then resuspended in ~50ul bc <dig>  the magnetic beads were treated with rnase a  followed by proteinase k  according to the manufacturers’ instructions. the samples were then cleaned up with dna clean & concentrator- <dig> . the chip library was prepared using the multiplexed chip-seq sample preparation protocol available on the university of pennsylvania functional genomics core website . chip libraries were run on a  <dig> % agarose gel to verify amplification and size. chip libraries were submitted to seqmatic  for illumina hiseq sequencing. sequencing data were sent to bioinforx  for analysis using bxchipseq  <dig> . briefly, bowtie  <cit>  was used to align raw sequence reads to the mouse genome  with options ‘-v 2-m  <dig> --best --strata,’ and all of the redundant tags were removed before downstream analysis. peak calling was carried out using homer  <cit>  with a default option  on chiped samples against the matching input samples. since the two replicates for each chip had similar profiles, the data were combined to make a single peak call. all chip-seq data were normalized to  <dig> reads per million mapped reads . a specific peak was defined as having an enrichment within a  <dig> bp region of more than 4-fold between two cell populations. the remaining peaks were defined as constitutive. gene ontology  analysis was performed by using great  <cit> . all genomics data have been deposited in the geo repository .

bet domain inhibition
escs were grown in differentiation conditions in esc media, and cells were treated with 100nm or 200nm -jq <dig>  for  <dig> days, with media changes on alternate days. dmso was used as a control.

RESULTS
global changes of the abundance of histone methylation and acetylation during esc differentiation
escs were differentiated to embryoid bodies  by culturing them in suspension. ebs were further differentiated using all-trans retinoic acid . microscopy images were taken at each time point that cells were collected: escs, ebs, ra-treated ebs, and ra-treated cells plated for  <dig> and  <dig> days . cells showed evident morphological changes at each stage, with the appearance of filamentous projections in the plated ra-treated cells, consistent with neuronal differentiation using ra. to identify the changes of histone ptm abundance during esc differentiation, histones were isolated from cells collected at each time point and analyzed by mass spectrometry  using our bottom up ms platform consisting of chemical derivatization and high-resolution ms  <cit> .fig.  <dig> cell morphology and dynamic changes in abundance of histone ptms. a retinoic acid differentiation of escs results in neuronal cells. from top to bottom, cce escs were grown in suspension for  <dig> days in the absence of lif/2i to form embryoid bodies. the embryoid bodies were treated with  <dig> μm all-trans retinoic acid for  <dig> days. cells were plated on gelatin-coated plates and grown for  <dig> days and  <dig> days. red scale bar represents  <dig> μm. b relative abundance of histone ptms during cell differentiation. heatmap of all single histone modifications from histone h <dig> and h <dig>  calculated by summing the relative abundance of all peptides carrying each given ptm. a and b represent the two biological replicates for each analyzed time point. the represented value was obtained by averaging the three technical replicates and performing z-score normalization for the rows



the ms analysis provided us with the changes in global abundance of histone methylation and acetylation . the analysis using principle component analysis  confirmed that the histone ptm abundance profiles at escs are distinguishable to those at ebs and ra-treated cells . statistical analysis using one-way anova identified the histone ptms whose quantities are significantly affected during differentiation. for instance, h3k9me <dig> increased  soon after differentiation into eb, consistent with the increase of the genome-wide distribution of h3k9me <dig> upon cell differentiation  <cit> , while h3k9me <dig> abundance become reduced upon differentiation  . also, h3k4me <dig> levels were significantly reduced upon differentiation among other k <dig> methylation  , which also well resonant to the recent genome-wide survey of h3k4me <dig> in various cell types  <cit> . h3k27me <dig> drastically reduced from escs to day  <dig> , which does not match with the genome-wide survey where h3k27me <dig> levels were increased in the normalized intergenic h3k27me <dig> signals  <cit> . the discrepancy with this study may due to the focal distribution of h3k27me <dig> in escs, which expands upon differentiation  <cit> . abundance of h3k <dig> methylation was also affected especially in ebs, with  <dig>  % h3k36me <dig> compared to  <dig>  % in escs, which may indicate the emergence of mixed cell populations and non-neuronal lineages consistent with spontaneous differentiation .

the majority of histone acetylation marks become significantly reduced in their quantity upon ra treatment including h3k23ac, h4k8ac, h4k12ac and h4k5ac. on the other hand, h3k14ac and h4k16ac were increased after differentiation , showing dynamic changes in the abundance in histone acetylation as well as methylation.

decrease of multiply acetylated lysine on h <dig> during differentiation
unique to our approach is the ability to quantify multiple histone ptms. for instance, we observed that h3k27me3k36me <dig> was reduced  while the relative quantity of h3k36me <dig> was increasing during the differentiation . especially, using the intact peptide gkggkglgkggakr , which contains all the histone h <dig> acetylation sites, we could also investigate the co-existence of up to four histone acetylation marks on lysine residues. we observed unique changes of the combinatorial histone ptm abundance. interestingly, multiply acetylated peptides including tetra-acetylated peptide  were decreased during differentiation. indeed, majority of the peptides with multiply-acetylated lysine were decreased in the differentiated cells compared with escs except for h4k5ack16ac . this may in part be due to h4k16ac increasing upon differentiation . in this context, is interesting to note that brd <dig> binds to all multiply acetylated h <dig> sites except h4k16ac, coupling histone ptms to transcriptional elongation  <cit> .fig.  <dig> histone peptide regulation during differentiation. heatmap of all quantified peptides using nlc-ms from histone h <dig> and h <dig>  a and b represent the two biological replicates for each analyzed time point. the represented value was obtained by averaging the three technical replicates and performing z-score normalization for the rows.



brd <dig> is a marker for self-renewal that binds to multiply acetylated histone proteins
the decreased abundance in multiply acetylated lysine prompted us to further investigate the abundance of mono-and multiply acetylated peptides using histone h <dig> aa 4- <dig> peptide. we observed that this peptide containing two, three and four acetylations decreased significantly during differentiation, while monoacetylated h <dig> peptides increased . as multiply acetylated histone ptms are the potential targets for brd <dig>  we investigated the changes of the brd <dig> abundance during differentiation. western blot analysis of the escs, ebs and ra-treated cells revealed that the pluripotency master regulator oct <dig> decreased as ra differentiation progressed, while neuronal marker βiii tubulin increased. in line with down-regulation of oct <dig>  the protein levels of brd <dig> also decreased upon eb formation and further in differentiated cells in the two replicates we investigated . the decreasing levels of histone h <dig> acetylation observed in mass spectrometry was not very obviously confirmed in western analysis as the antibody was raised to tetra-acetylated h <dig>  however, a slightly decreasing trend of acetylated h <dig> can be seen as escs differentiate.fig.  <dig> regulation of histone acetylation and brd <dig>  a analysis of the acetylated state of the peptide of histone h <dig> aa 4- <dig>  the singly acetylated form increases during differentiation, while the hyperacetylated states decrease. above the bars in red the anova p-value  among the different conditions is displayed. b western blotting of brd <dig>  oct <dig> βiii-tubulin and lamin, this last one used as control. brd <dig> decreases during differentiation, and so oct <dig>  on the bottom, antibody recognizing acetylated histone h <dig>  c qrt-pcr of oct <dig> , brd <dig>  and brd <dig>  across the five time points of the differentiation process. actin was used as the reference gene



cells collected at each time-point were also analyzed by qrt-pcr for expression of oct <dig> , brd <dig> and brd <dig> . ebs were grown for  <dig> days in suspension; ra after  <dig> days grown in suspension with ra. ra 4d and ra 7d were grown on gelatin coated plates . oct <dig> levels were maintained in eb, indicating lingering presence of oct <dig> transcripts. on the other hand, oct <dig> decreased rapidly upon differentiation in the presence of ra which is a strong differentiation agent. importantly, brd <dig> levels decreased upon ra differentiation, synchronous with oct <dig> expression, further indicating that their expressions are linked each other. we also investigated the expression of another related bet domain protein, brd <dig>  we found that in general, the expression of brd <dig> also somewhat mirrored the overall brd <dig> and oct <dig> expression trend, to the extent of showing a spike in the eb stage, similar to oct <dig>  this may explain increase of some acetylation marks at eb stage. however, the changes of its levels in the differentiated cells compared with escs are not significant. besides, previous study found that brd <dig> does not disrupt the self-renewing characteristics of escs  <cit> . taken together, all this data suggest that histone acetylation and brd <dig> are most likely the major epigenetic determinants of esc pluripotency.

effect of bet domain inhibition on the epigenome and cellular pluripotency
in order to confirm the role of brd <dig> during differentiation, escs were treated with either  <dig> nm or  <dig> nm of the bet domain inhibitor -jq <dig> for  <dig> days . since the escs were engineered to express nanog-gfp, we assessed pluripotency by facs as nanog is only expressed in pluripotent cells. about  <dig> % of the escs were nanog-gfp positive, while it was about the same in dmso  as expected, -jq1-treated escs showed a decrease in nanog-gfp: about  <dig> % expressing nanog-gfp following  <dig> mm -jq <dig> treatment and  <dig> % following with  <dig> mm -jq <dig> treatment .fig.  <dig> analysis of key regulatory proteins and histone ptms during jq <dig> cell treatment. a -jq <dig> treatment of escs results in a decrease in nanog-gfp as measured by facs. b in triplicate experiments, escs were initiated into differentiation in medium lacking lif. matched cultures comprising dmso control , ra treatment for  <dig> days , jq <dig> treatment for  <dig> days  and ra for  <dig> days followed by jq <dig> for  <dig> days were maintained and for  <dig> days with media changes on alternate days. on harvest, mrna abundance was analyzed by qpcr using a panel of primers . the ddct data was represented as relative fold over dmso control . expression of pluripotency markers, oct <dig> and nanog decreases upon ra and -jq <dig> treatment as compared to dmso control without drug, while expression of germ layer markers increased. the trends of differentiation by inhibition of bet domain by these two treatments and a combination thereof are shown as averages  of multiple markers, respectively for endoderm and neurectoderm. c most significant histone ptm changes during inhibitor treatment. d representation of all histone ptms by plotting their log <dig> fold change between untreated cells and treated with  <dig> nm  or  <dig> nm  of jq <dig> inhibitor. significant changes were considered when the–test p-value  was < <dig> , equivalent to > <dig>  when transformed into–log <dig>  color code represents different histone modification types. e representation of all histone peptide regulations in cells untreated vs treated with jq <dig>  the two different doses were marked with black and red dots. the figure displays a tight correlation of histone peptide regulation between the two treatments



for further analysis of gene expression subsequent to bet inhibition, the expression level of markers for endoderm, mesoderm and neuroectoderm in the following conditions were analyzed: esc , dmso control ,  <dig> μm ra treatment for  <dig> days ,  <dig> μm jq <dig> treatment for  <dig> days  and ra for  <dig> days followed by jq <dig> for  <dig> days . all differentiation conditions were devoid of lif. in order to compare the relative mrna expressions ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  the data was normalized using z-score and was represented as relative fold over dmso control  . as expected, all the three treatment conditions downregulated expression of pluripotency genes, oct <dig> and nanog. brachyury, a mesodermal marker seems to be either unchanged or very low compared to dmso control. surprisingly, there was induction of both endoderm and neurectoderm markers with all treatment regimens. however late endoderm marker specific for hepatocytes, alb  was not detected. average expression of all endodermal markers was similar to that of neurectodermal markers  with ra treatment, while with jq <dig> alone they were confirmed that jq <dig> promoted differentiation comparable to ra. the potency of ra and jq <dig> is validated by inhibition of brd <dig> expression in all treatment conditions. however, unlike earlier reported, we did not find jq <dig> augmenting the neurectodermal induction by ra when treated with in succession   <cit> .

in addition, histones were analyzed and compared to dmso-treated escs. histone modifications also were found to change in their relative abundance upon -jq <dig> treatment . as we predict jq <dig> to promote differentiation, we noted that both concentrations of -jq <dig> provided very comparable effects on the fold changes of histone ptms as compared to escs control . brd <dig> was reported to bind to enhancers with h3k4me <dig>  <cit>  and in this study, jq <dig> decreased h3k4me <dig> . the vast majority of acetylated marks were found to be regulated . acetylation such as h4k16ac that are decreased in differentiation, were also decreased upon jq <dig> treatment, indicating that jq <dig> treatment had no effect on this mark. this is in agreement with h4k16ac not being the binding partner of brd <dig>  <cit> . similarly, tetra-acetylated peptide  increased upon the jq <dig> treatment, suggesting that decrease of the tetra-acetylation is not a requirement for cell differentiation. on the other hand, h3k79ac and k9ac were increased on brd <dig> inhibition. moreover, di-acetylated peptide  and tri-acetylated peptide  were significantly reduced. these show that jq <dig> facilitates cell differentiation, but the epigenetic landscapes it changes are rather broad and should only be interpreted in a locus-specific manner. collectively, our data suggest that differentiation of escs is tightly linked to failure of brd <dig> binding to chromatin, which alters the global epigenome.

re-distribution of brd <dig> biding site during differentiation
to understand the role of brd <dig> in pluripotency, we performed chip-seq against brd <dig> and the highly acetylated state of histone h <dig>  we first confirmed the specificity of both the brd <dig>  and acetyl-h <dig> antibodies . the brd <dig> antibody normally detected a  <dig> kda protein . for detecting acetyl-h <dig>  we dot blotted  <dig>  μg- <dig>  μg of h <dig> peptides , as well as nuclear extract from hela and esc cells. hybridization of anti-acetyl h <dig> to h <dig>  peptides  revealed that among the singly acetylated h <dig> peptides, the antibody slightly recognizes h <dig> acetylated at k <dig>  strongly recognizes h <dig> acetylated at k <dig> and at k <dig>  but does not recognize h <dig> acetylated at k <dig> . more importantly, the antibody also strongly recognizes the tetra-acetylated h <dig> peptide, acetylated at all four lysine residues . it does not recognize the unmodified h <dig> peptide, which was the biggest concern for non-specific binding. due to the similar nature of histone h2b tails, hplc-purified h2b from hela and escs were tested as well. the anti-acetyl h <dig> antibody has some slight cross-reactivity with h2b, an unfortunate, but unavoidable small issue.

to understand the role of brd <dig>  we further investigated genomic distribution of brd <dig> in escs and ebs. applying the homer peak calling algorithm, we identified  <dig>  esc specific,  <dig> eb specific and  <dig>  peaks constitutive to both cell types . gene ontology  analysis using great found that the enriched terms for the eb specific peaks include “hypothalamus development” and “cerebellar purkinje cell differentiation”, suggesting that brd <dig> gained binding close to the genes related with neuronal development in ebs . on the other hand, the enriched terms for the esc specific peaks include “head morphogenesis” and “regulation of osteoclast differentiation”, suggesting that loss of brd <dig> for the developmental genes other than neuronal development in ebs . the constitutive peaks are enriched for the terms such as “regulation of intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway”, “blastocyst formation”, and “histone h4-k <dig> acetylation” .fig.  <dig> redistribution of brd <dig> binding sites during differentiation. a chip occupancy for esc  and eb  specific brd <dig> peaks. read per million  was calculated for the brd <dig> occupancy in esc and ebs  go for eb specific peaks. terms related with neuronal differentiation are enriched  go analysis for the esc specific peaks



oct <dig> , a marker for pluripotency showed constitutive brd <dig> peaks between escs and ebs . the promoter region of left-right determination factor  <dig> , which is important for axis development  <cit> , also have the constitutive peaks, but its brd <dig> levels are stronger in ebs . wnt <dig>  important factor for neuronal development  <cit>  also gained a brd <dig> peak at its promoter region . il-17f, an important factor for t cells, lost the brd <dig> peak in escs, these well represent that ebs have mixed population of stem cells and already committed cells and brd <dig> reflects the characteristics of cells. cell-type specific brd <dig> peaks match well with the enrichment of h4ac , showing the high affinity of brd <dig> with h4ac. brd <dig> overlapped with more than  <dig> % of pluripotent factors  and more than  <dig> % of c-myc and n-myc binding sites within 1kbps  <cit> . however, the overlap with an insulator ctcf is only  <dig> percent. these show that brd <dig> is involved in transcriptional mechanism of diverse tfs, but not with insulators .fig.  <dig> genes associated with h4ac and brd <dig> binding. brd <dig> and h4ac occupancies in escs and ebs are shown. a) constitutive brd <dig> peaks near pou5f <dig>  eb specific increase in brd <dig> occupancy at leafy <dig> promoter  eb-specific brd <dig> peaks at wnt <dig> promoter  esc specific brd <dig> peaks at il17f promoter



discussion
brd <dig> among other bet domain family members uniquely characterizes esc maintenance  <cit> . we investigated the role of brd <dig> using proteomic as well as genomic approaches during differentiation and sought functional validation by treating with the brd <dig> inhibitor, jq <dig>  our proteomic approaches revealed the changes in the abundance of histone ptms, which were dynamically regulated during the esc differentiation. for instance h3k4me <dig>  a mark associated with enhancers for active transcription  <cit>  decreased during differentiation in this study and could well be used to localize genes that were turned on in the ra-directed esc differentiation model by chip-seq. on the other hand, this study confirms earlier reports of depletion of h3k27me <dig> during differentiation  <cit> . besides these and other significant changes in many acetylated sites, we quantified histone ptms such as h3k18me <dig> and h3k23me <dig> that have not been well studied previously. the current data embodies evidence for unknown roles for these ptm marks during differentiation.

changes in global acetylation levels were marked during differentiation with ra and jq <dig>  one example is global reduction of h3k9ack14ac. this agrees with the previous work indicating that h3k9ac and h3k14ac co-localize with bivalent domains  in escs  <cit> . therefore, the decrease of h3k9ack14ac may be linked to the loss of bivalent domains upon differentiation. moreover, h3k9me2k14ac and h3k9me3k14ac are significantly increased in differentiated cells compared to escs. this is not surprising since h3k9me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> have been shown to be a barrier to pluripotency of reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells  <cit> .

majority, except for h3k14ac and h4k16ac, of the acetylated peptides were decreased in differentiation, indicating that acetylation marks may be differentially regulated during differentiation. interestingly, tetra-acetylated peptides in h <dig>  were reduced in their abundance during differentiation. these multiply acetylated h <dig> peptides are the major target for brd <dig>  as noted earlier, h4k16ac, which increased in its abundance during differentiation is not the binding partner of brd <dig> although brd <dig> binds to many other kinds of histone acetylation  <cit> .

brd <dig> is the double bromodomain protein that binds hyperacetylated histone h <dig> and promotes passage of elongating rna polymerase ii through activating transcribed genes. there was a correlation between decrease in brd <dig> abundance and histone h <dig> hypoacetylation  in differentiating escs. this was further mirrored in brd <dig> inhibition studies where the bet domain inhibitor -jq <dig> counteracts and inhibits brd <dig> binding to target chromatin sites in escs and caused the escs to differentiate as determined by decreased nanog-gfp expression, and by qrt-pcr for pluripotency and differentiation. it is conceivable that brd <dig> activates these genes by binding to acetylated histone h <dig> 

western blotting confirmed that the pluripotency factor oct <dig> decreased upon differentiation, while the neuron-specific βiii tubulin protein increased. concomitantly, brd <dig> levels decreased immediately upon eb formation and further with ra induced differentiation. moreover, qrt-pcr analysis performed on oct <dig>  brd <dig>  and brd <dig> showed that while both oct <dig> and brd <dig> expression decreased upon differentiation, while brd <dig> expression did not show the same immediate trend. this suggests that brd <dig> and brd <dig> have potential different functions in pluripotency and differentiation. in agreement with these results, a study recently showed that brd <dig> depletion impairs esc colony formation while brd <dig> depletion has no such effect  <cit> . the decrease of brd <dig> with differentiation led to the next question of whether inhibition of brd <dig> could also induce cellular differentiation.

inhibition of brd <dig> by -jq <dig> treatment of escs was associated with corresponding down-regulation of the pluripotency genes, nanog and oct <dig>  presumably through inhibited brd <dig>  these observations are consistent with previous work demonstrating brd <dig> regulation of nanog and oct <dig> expression  <cit> . the induction of neurectodermal lineage was evidenced by the concomitant increase in the expression of panel of markers . besides, ra also induced endoderm and this effect is well-documented. ra is a morphogen that has been used in in vitro pancreatic differentiation protocols for inducing early pancreatic markers  <cit> . elsewhere, studies have reported the induction of neurectoderm over endoderm  <cit> . similarly, ra has been shown to potentiate mesoderm in es cells in the presence of other morphogens such as bmp  <cit> . however, induction of these germ layers by jq1-effected brd <dig> inhibition resulted in an increase in h3k <dig> methylation, which is known to be associated with differentiation  <cit> . further, brd <dig> peaks overlapped with h4ac enrichment in our chip-seq analysis. these experiments indicate that brd <dig>  histone h <dig> acetylation and active transcription presumably of master developmental genes  are linked, and the genome-wide localization of brd <dig> confirms its involvement in pluripotency.

contrary to the global decrease of h <dig> tetra-acetylation upon the jq <dig> treatment, we identified global increase of acetylation histone forms. this indicates that the epigenetic landscape becomes disrupted after jq <dig> treatment. the genome-wide re-distribution of brd <dig> strongly indicates that brd <dig> maintains self-renewal as well as play a role during differentiation in concert with acetylated histone ptms. the loss of the brd <dig> function by jq <dig> may prevent cells from monitoring the levels of acetylated histones. the loss of monitoring function may responsible for the increase of tetra-acetylation upon jq <dig> treatment.

CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our data demonstrate that brd <dig> plays a fundamental role in regulating cell differentiation with its binding to acetylated histones. specifically our inhibitor treatment study proves that disruption of brd <dig> interaction to acetylated histone marks may cause aberrant differentiation.
