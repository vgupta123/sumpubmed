BACKGROUND
solving structures of complexes is inherently more difficult than solving those for individual proteins. as a result, significantly fewer structures of protein complexes than individual proteins have been determined experimentally  <cit> . in recent years, homology modeling  <cit>  proved to be successful when the target protein has a similar sequence to proteins with known structures. however, the lack of a sufficiently large database of reference complexes makes the method unsuitable for structural modeling of protein complexes. a conceptually simple and straightforwardly applicable approach for modeling structures of bio-molecular complexes is highly desirable. when proposing new protein complexes, the models developed should be checked against the following attributes: stereo-chemically sound, having sufficient interfacial solvent excluded surface areas  <cit>   to provide adequate binding strengths, physically meaningful for transcription regulation and consistency with the known experimental data.

phob is a response regulator of the two-component signaling system that is activated under phosphate starvation conditions  <cit> . it activates more than  <dig> genes of the pho regulon  <cit> . structurally similar to many other response regulators, phob has two domains: an n-terminal receiver domain  and a c-terminal effector domain . the ed of phob adopts a winged-helix structure that consists of three α-helices flanked by two sets of β-sheets  <cit> . the phob rd adopts a β-α structure  <cit>  that can be classified as a flavodoxin-like fold according to scop  <cit> . the flavodoxin-like fold can be found in rds of other response regulators as well as flavodoxins  <cit> , cytochrome-p <dig> oxidoreductase  <cit>  and toll/interleukin receptor tir domains  <cit> . these protein domains share the same structural fold with little or no sequence homology.

while phob has long been known to regulate the expression of the pho regulon, the specific geometry of the transcription initiation complex remains undetermined. in recent years, a significant amount of work has been dedicated to solving structures of rnap complexes . the bacterial rna polymerase  is a multi-molecular complex consisting of five subunits including: two α-subunits, a β-subunit, a β'-subunit and an ω-subunit. to start transcription, the rnap has to first bind a σ-subunit. this rnap/σ-subunit complex then recognizes and binds to a targeted dna operator site to go through the transcription process. in  <dig>  the low-resolution  structure of the thermus aquaticus rnap holoenzyme with a fork-junction promoter dna complex  was solved  <cit> . since then, crystal structures of different rnap holoenzymes were solved to a higher resolution  <cit>  . more recently, an electron microscopy -derived structure of a catabolite gene activator -dependent transcription initiation complex has been derived  <cit>  . the structural information available so far provides a knowledge base for modeling of the transcription initiation complex together with the response regulator phob. in particular, the structure of the catabolite gene activator -dependent transcription initiation complex  provides an ideal template for modeling structure of the phob-dependent transcription initiation complex.

RESULTS
we begin by considering the phob dimer as it interacts with dna, for which no complete structure exists. in the crystal structure of the phob ed dimer bound to pho box dna , the binding of dna direct repeats force the ed dimer to bind with a tandem symmetry. the known structure of the phob rd dimeric complex  <cit>  , however, follows a two-fold rotational symmetry. while it is possible to simply rotate one of the eds relative to the rd to make a complex satisfying both structures, this procedure results in a tightly stretched linker, asymmetry between the two phobs, and fabricating an rd-ed interface from scratch. alternatively, we examine the variety of response regulator structures that contain rd and ed together . these structures contain the information of rd/ed mbgs and demonstrate that the two domains can interact with a variety of binding geometries.

combining the information of rd/ed mbgs with the structure of the ed/ed dimeric complex , we explore the potential solutions for the phob dimeric complex. out of the rd/ed conformations, only that of drrb  <cit>  , a phob/ompr homolog, provides a satisfactory solution where the two rds are in contact but not overlapping. combining the structural information of ed/ed , rd/ed , ed  and rd , the model of the phob dimeric complex is developed . this model structure has appealing features including: good stereochemistry , protein-like structure  and several of the known mbgs.

this phob in the modeled complex contains a previously unseen interface between rds, however, because of the tandem head-to-tail orientation - that is different from the two-fold symmetry observed in the phob rd/rd dimer . the next question is "does the new mbg between the two rds in the model exists in other protein domains of a similar fold?" to answer this question, we search for interfaces between domains that have the flavodoxin-like fold and give the two domains with a tandem symmetry. interestingly, the chey  of the two chey-p <dig> heterodimers in the crystal asymmetric unit  <cit>  , has the two flavodoxin-like molecules following a tandem symmetry. this contact of the two cheys  in the crystal is very similar to that of the phob dimeric rds as shown in figure 1c. while this particular chey dimeric arrangement may not be functionally relevant for the chey-chea interaction, it does provide a potential mbg for the interaction of flavodoxin-like molecules.

we turn our attention to the transcription initiation complex. we choose to use the transcription initiation complex with dna and the catabolite activator protein bound to it  as a template for our model. the dna duplex can serve as a structural link and allow the assembly of all the components into one functional unit. all the proteins in the complex either have a direct contact  or contacts thru other molecules  that can link to the dna molecule. the dna molecule that we select for this study is the e. coli k- <dig> phoa promoter  with both σ-subunit and phob binding sites . to enable comparison, the sequences of the two promoters  are shown in figure 2a with the cap promoter  shown on the top and the phoa promoter shown at the bottom. the protein binding sites on the two promoters are highlighted in boxes. the main difference between the two promoters is the relative binding locations for the two factors. the cap binding sites are located upstream of the - <dig> site while the phob binding sites are overlapping with the - <dig> sites. there was a structural concern, whether the - <dig> and the two phob binding sites can be utilized simultaneously. when these binding sites are utilized simultaneously, a set of interactions between the rnap and the two phob molecules can be predicted by our model.

in additional to the difference in the binding sites, changes in the dna from 3iyd will be required because the cap dimer binds and bends the dna promoter much more than does the phob dimer. therefore, the promoter region of the dna in the phob transcription initiation complex has to be remodeled from the template structure . using a "motif modeling approach" as described in our earlier work  <cit> , the structure of the dna upstream to this overlapping region  can be modeled using the structure of dna from the phob ed/dna complex . this promoter dna is extended upstream with a piece of canonical dna duplex to accommodate the α-subunit c-terminal domain  binding. as a comparison, we have modeled the same piece of dna upstream to this overlapping region using only a piece of canonical dna b-duplex. the template dna , the remodeled promoter dna for phob transcription initiation complex, and the upstream dna in a canonical b-duplex conformation are shown in figure 2b in white, magenta, and cyan respectively.

after the structure of the promoter dna duplex is re-modeled, the corresponding proteins can be assembled back into the phob transcription initiation complex using the information of their mbgs with their targeted sites on the dna . with the remodeling of the promoter dna, the positions and orientations of α-ctd and σ-ctd are different from those in the template structure. the connecting loops between the n-terminal domain  and ctd of the α- and σ-subunits also needed to be changed accordingly  <cit> . the resultant structure  has the subunits interacting but not overlapping with each other, a necessary condition for complex structural modeling. according to the model, α-ctd, σ-ctd as well as a segment  of β-subunit are in direct contact with the two phob molecules in the complex. to improve the stereochemistry between the interacting subunits, the remodeled portions of the complex, including the dna promoter, the phob dimer, the α-ctd, the σ-ctd and residues  <dig> to  <dig> of β-subunit were subjected to a refinement procedure using amber  <cit> .

the energy-refined structure of this portion of phob transcription initiation complex is shown in figure 3b and a coordinate file is available as supplementary material. the clearest self-consistency check from our model is that the overlapping binding sites covering the - <dig> region allow the simultaneous binding of the phob dimer and the σ-ctd without violating the volume exclusions for all the molecules involved in the binding. both α-ctd and σ-ctd interact directly with one of the phob molecules  that binds to the site upstream of the - <dig> region. for a more detailed check on the validity of our model, we note that the residues at the interface between these molecules include: r- <dig>  q- <dig>  i- <dig>  a- <dig>  k- <dig> from the α-ctd, d- <dig>  v- <dig>  a- <dig>  n- <dig> from the σ-ctd and w- <dig>  g- <dig>  v- <dig>  e- <dig>  d- <dig> from the phob . this result is consistent with the four phob residues  identified to be involved in the polymerase binding based on mutation study  <cit> . the residues on the two phob molecules that interact directly with α-ctd, β-subunit and σ-ctd are annotated in figure 4b. our results indicate that both the rd and ed domains of the two phob molecules in the dimer are interacting with the rnap/σ-subunit of the transcription initiation complex. the solvent excluded surface areas for phob-a/α-subunit, phob-a/σ-subunit and phob-b/β-subunit are  <dig>  Å <dig>   <dig>  Å <dig> and  <dig>  Å <dig> respectively. these values are consistent with those   <cit>  observed in the heterocomplexes from pdb.

there exist off-the-shelf software that allows dockings of proteins or protein domains into complexes/full proteins . these programs apply different sampling approaches and scoring functions with various degrees of success . these docking procedures seem to work at their best if the interaction between the components is strong and/or there exists a global binding minimum. as a quick comparison, we have downloaded one of these programs, zdock, and generated  <dig>  structures  docking the two domains rd  and ed  for deriving the phob structure. the two domains  of phob molecule are separated by a loop of 4-peptides group. there is a physical limitation for a 4-residues loop to make the connection. if the cut-off length for a 4-residues loop is set to be  <dig> angstrom , only  <dig> %  of the  <dig>  mbgs satisfied the connection criteria. if we focus on the set of the top  <dig> mbgs, structures  <dig> and  <dig> are the two that allow the rd-ed connection. a further look at the phob-phob dimer structures modeled based on the two ed-rd mbgs and the structure of the ed-ed-dna complex , neither structure is stereochemically feasible due to the domain overlapping including clashes between protein-protein and protein-dna. if all the mbgs of the two domains from the docking study are compared to the mbg from our model, the closest came from structure  <dig>  with a rmsd of  <dig>  angstrom . overall, the docking procedure is less than efficient . it was also found that the selection of the relevant phob structure out of the pool of a large number of potential mbgs from the docking study is a non-trivial task.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that motif binding geometry  can be used to model structure of the phob dimer as it interacts with the transcription initiation complex  of e. coli. while the limited space available for the targeted protein in the molecular complex makes the modeling of the protein structure more challenging, it also provides a stringent test for choosing the relevant structure from the pool of potential conformations. while the two domains  of phob adopt a different symmetry when crystallized, it is not obvious how to assemble the phob dimer from the information of its domain structures. using the excluded volume information and known mbgs between the ed and rd, we are able to develop a structural model for the phob dimeric complex where the two rd domains follow a tandem symmetry similar to that as seen in the two flavodoxin-like folds of chey, a chemotaxis protein. the modeled phob dimer can bind to the direct repeat pho box in the promoter region and interact directly with the α-, β- and σ- subunits of the rnap.

just as protein structures serve to integrate a variety of biochemical information and advance our understanding of the enzymatic reactions and molecular machines that enable life to continue, modeling of protein complexes will shed light on the protein interaction networks responsible for regulatory and signaling processes of cells. while our approach has not yet been tested with other protein complexes, it is hoped that the reader will see our methodology as a way of integrating the evolutionary, physical, and biological experimental data to produce new, testable, hypothesis.
