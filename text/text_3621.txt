BACKGROUND
superoxide dismutases  are crucial enzymes in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. they catalyse the dismutation of the superoxide radical to hydrogen peroxide and dioxygen according to the two-step reaction as follows:

m3+ + o <dig> .- → m2+ + o2

m2+ + o <dig> .- + 2h+ → m3+ + h2o2

where m denotes a metal ion which interconverts between oxidised and reduced states. the superoxide radical o <dig> .- is formed in cells as a result of both enzymatic and spontaneous oxidation reactions. the superoxide radical is toxic to living cells as it oxidises and degrades biological molecules such as lipids and proteins  <cit> .

for many years it was thought that malaria parasites had no requirement for an endogenous superoxide dismutase and merely exploited the activity of the host's enzyme in the red blood cell  <cit> . however, in  <dig> a plasmodium falciparum iron-dependent sod  was identified in parasites isolated from infected blood cells  <cit> . malaria parasites are particularly prone to oxidative damage in the intra-erythrocytic stage of their lifecycle. this is because an important source of amino acids for the parasite is red blood cell haemoglobin. haemoglobin degradation produces free haem groups leading to oxidation of the iron from the ferrous  to the ferric  state. this oxidation liberates electrons, which promote the formation of reactive oxygen intermediates, including superoxide. the pffesod gene is expressed at its highest level during this stage of the parasite life cycle  <cit> .

sods are classified according to their metal cofactors. eukaryotic cells are generally served by a cytosolic cu/znsod and an evolutionarily unrelated mitochondrial mnsod. some eukaryotes also contain a sod containing a single fe atom. bacterial cells feature single metal-centred sods in which the metal can be either manganese or iron. the fesods and the mnsods exhibit recognisable similarities in their sequences, they have a common α/β tertiary structure and they use the same residues to coordinate the metal  <cit> . these are quite distinct from the two-metal cu/znsods, which have a greek key β-barrel fold  <cit> . the mnsods of eukaryotic origin are distinguishable from those of prokaryotic sources on the basis of their quaternary structure; the former are tetramers while the latter are dimers. small sequence differences distinguish the mn- and fesods  <cit> . biochemically, fesods are more sensitive to inhibition by azide  <cit>  and have a greater susceptibility to inactivation by hydrogen peroxide, than mnsods. iron and manganese superoxide dismutases can bind either metal cofactor. however, most are only functional with their cognate metal co-factor bound. some enzymes however, maintain activity with either fe or mn bound and are termed cambialistic  <cit> .

in  <dig>  an electron paramagnetic resonance and modelling study of sod from p. falciparum showed it was, as expected, an iron-dependent dimer  <cit> . the fact that it is an fesod and distinct from human tetrameric mn and cu/znsods raises the possibility of its exploitation as an anti-malarial drug target  <cit>  and indeed inhibitors of pffesod have been identified  <cit> . this study presents an x-ray crystal structure of p. falciparum fesod solved at a resolution of  <dig>  Å.

RESULTS
protein characterization
purified pffesod was resolved by electrophoresis for  <dig> hours at  <dig> v in a 10% native polyacrylamide gel. the gel was soaked in riboflavin and nadph to generate superoxide radicals, and stained by nitro blue tetrazolium  dye. nbt reacts with superoxide to form a blue precipitate when fixed in a gel. any regions on the gel that exhibit sod activity will therefore be white against a blue background. a clear white band coincident with the pffesod protein indicated that the protein was active. analytical ultracentrifugation  sedimentation equilibrium experiments estimated the molecular weight of the protein to be  <dig>  ±  <dig> da. since the calculated molecular weight of the monomer is  <dig>  da, this indicates that pffesod is a dimer, consistent with previously characterised fesods, which are either dimers or tetramers.

overall structure
the crystal structure of pffesod has been solved and refined against data extending to  <dig>  Å spacing. the refined model consists of two polypeptide chains, a and b, which are related by a non-crystallographic two-fold axis of symmetry, together with two iron ions and  <dig> solvent water molecules. the electron density maps are contiguous from residue  <dig> to residue  <dig> of both chains. the c-terminal pffesod residue , together with the eight residues of the c-terminal tag are not observed in the electron density maps. details of the refinement statistics are given in table  <dig>  there is a solitary outlier in the ramachandran plot at residue lys <dig> in the b chain, which occurs in a partially ordered surface loop. the ser15-pro <dig> peptide bond in both chains is in the cis conformation.

the overall structure is similar to those of previously solved iron superoxide dismutases, consisting of an amino terminal α-helical domain linked to a carboxy terminal α/β domain. the first eleven residues have an extended structure and are involved in crystal packing. the next  <dig> residues form two long anti-parallel α-helices  connected by a meandering loop containing a third helix, α <dig>  in both subunits, helix α <dig> has a noticeable kink at the conserved lys <dig> residue, a feature that has been noted before  <cit> . this domain is connected via an extended loop to the α/β domain , which comprises a three-stranded anti-parallel β-pleated sheet  surrounded by four α-helices. superposition of equivalent cα atoms of chain a and chain b of pffesod gives a positional root mean squared deviation  of  <dig>  Å. the pffesod structure superposes onto the molecular replacement model, e. coli fesod, with an rmsΔ of  <dig>  Å over all equivalent cα atoms.

structural comparisons and dimer interface
the tertiary structure is very similar to that of a number of other fe- or mn-dependent sod enzymes. of particular interest is comparison with the tetrameric mnsod found in human mitochondria. subtle differences in the structures may allow the design of inhibitors to block the activity of fesod selectively without affecting the mnsod. the arrangement of the active site residues is well conserved between the fe and mnsods; the only significant difference in main chain conformation arises in the loop connecting α <dig> and α <dig>  which is remote from the active site and the dimer interface.

as is typical of sod proteins, only a relatively small accessible surface area  becomes buried in the dimer interface. the main contributions to the dimer interface arise from helix α <dig>  the loop that connects α <dig> to β <dig> and the loop connecting β <dig> to α <dig>  41% of the atoms forming the dimer interface are polar, while 59% are non-polar. there are five bridging water molecules within the dimer interface. there is an interesting pair of adjacent charge-charge interactions between the carboxylates of the asp <dig> residues and the side chain imidazoles of his <dig>  perhaps associated with this, the dihedral angles of residue asp <dig> appear in a generously allowed location on the ramachandran plot. these residues lie on what would be a classical β-turn were it not for the fact that residue  <dig> is an alanine rather than a glycine. all of the dimer stabilising interactions in the e. coli enzyme are conserved in pffesod. such high conservation of the dimer interface reflects the importance of dimerisation to the activity of dismutases.

active site of p. falciparum fesod
the metal ion in both subunits of the enzyme is five-coordinate. three bonds arise from coordination with histidine nε <dig> atoms of residues his <dig> , his <dig>  and his <dig> . a further bond is between the metal and the oδ <dig> atom of asp <dig> . the fifth coordination position is an oxygen atom from either a water molecule or a hydroxide species . the coordination geometry is trigonal bipyramidal, with his <dig>  his <dig> and asp <dig> providing the equatorial ligands and with his <dig> and the hydroxide or water oxygen atom forming the axial ligands.

the area around the active site is fairly hydrophobic with two tryptophan residues   <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å from the metal, respectively. trp <dig> forms a hydrogen bond to gln <dig>  which in turn forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of tyr <dig>  tyr <dig> is also hydrogen bonded via a water molecule to his <dig>  which is bonded to tyr <dig> from the other subunit. this classical hydrogen-bonding network in superoxide dismutases may allow communication between the two metal sites  <cit> . in the b chain however, we note that the gln <dig> nδ to tyr <dig> -oh distance is longer , perhaps due to coordinate error at this resolution. the spatial arrangement of the residues in the active site is otherwise identical to those of other fe-dependent superoxide dismutases whose structures are known, consistent with the notion that structure and mechanism are highly conserved in this enzyme class.

a second line of communication between the active sites is afforded by the intermolecular ionic/hydrogen bonding interaction between the fe-coordinating his <dig> and the carboxylate of glu <dig>  the latter is situated in a loop that links two fe-coordinating residues  in the opposing subunit. the relevance, if any, of structural communication between the active sites to the kinetics and mechanism of these enzymes is not established.

modelling of the p. falciparum mitochondrially targeted fesod
the sequence of the major fesod is highly conserved in different plasmodia species  and is encoded by a gene on chromosome  <dig>  consisting of a single exon. another gene product  with significant sequence homology is located on chromosome  <dig>  this pffesod <dig> gene is interrupted with multiple introns. the original gene model  was revised by a bioinformatic analysis to maximise primary sequence homology to pffesod, leading to a gene predicted to consist of nine exons, separated by eight introns with consensus splice donor/acceptor sites . evidence supporting the model was found by plasmodium interspecies conservation of the intron-exon structure, which is a good predictor for small exons  <cit>  and subsequently confirmed by cdna cloning  <cit> . a striking feature of the pffesod <dig> gene is that it encodes an n-terminal sequence typical of proteins that are targeted to sub-cellular organelles. the first two exons coincide precisely with elements of the bipartite signal  namely a signal sequence and a transit peptide. a gfp-fusion with the signal is directed to the mitochondrion, despite predictions from the sequence that it would be delivered to the apicoplast  <cit> . however, the gene structure not only hints at its evolution by exon shuffling, but provides the opportunity for alternatively spliced forms  <cit> .

a homology model  of the mitochondrially targeted pffesod <dig> was derived using the cytosolic pffesod structure solved here. the cytosolic pffesod is the closest in sequence of any dismutase to the mitochondrial pffesod and hence provides the most suitable coordinate set from which to construct a homology model. the model generated has an rmsΔ on all cα atoms of  <dig>  Å for the  <dig> matched residues. unsurprisingly the secondary structure is predicted to be identical to that of the cytosolic fesod of plasmodium. it appears that the active site and dimer interface are also well conserved. this is consistent across the fe/mnsod enzyme family, which is a highly conserved enzyme class. it remains to be seen if the two superoxide dismutases from plasmodium are indeed structurally and biochemically equivalent, or whether the mitochondrially targeted sod has a different turnover/stability that is required for function within a specific environment in the cell.

discussion
superoxide dismutases play a crucial role in the chemical protection strategies many cells adopt to counter the considerable threat posed by the superoxide anion radical. iron-containing superoxide dismutases are essentially confined to prokaryotes, algae, higher plants and certain protozoa  <cit> . in contrast, the human superoxide dismutases are either mn- or cu/zn-dependent. thus, selective inhibitors of fesods have potential uses in therapy against diseases caused by pathogens. at first sight it would appear difficult to inhibit pffesod using classical 'active-site directed' approaches. the substrate-binding site is small, it needs to accommodate just two atoms and the design of selective inhibitors may be hampered by the structural similarity that the iron-containing superoxide dismutases share with the manganese-dependent enzymes. superoxide is attracted to the active site of dismutases through a funnel, which comprises residues from both subunits in the dimer. the funnel lies at the top of the dimer interface near to the metal sites. it is thought that potential inhibitors could bind here and block access to the active site for the superoxide substrate  <cit> .

an alternative approach is to target inhibitors towards the subunit interface so as to disrupt the quaternary structure. a possible explanation of the widely accepted "ping-pong" kinetics observed for fesods would be if superoxide binding in one active site is accompanied by oxidation to oxygen in the other, with the iron atoms in the respective subunits maintaining opposing oxidation states as they alternate between the + <dig> and + <dig> forms. if so, dimerisation would likely be important to the mechanism of fesod, and monomeric fesods are not found in nature  <cit> . however, evidence from cu/znsods suggests that monomeric forms are active which may mean that dimerisation is not crucial for the function of all superoxide dismutases  <cit> . despite this, it is clear that the dimer interface in fe and mnsods is important in the sod reaction with dimer interface mutants of human mnsod exhibiting reduced steady-state catalytic constants  <cit> . other evidence points to the importance of dimerisation for functional sod activity, as dimer destabilising mutations of cu/zn sod have been linked to motor neuron disease  <cit> . although the mechanism is unclear, the destabilised mutants may be more prone to aggregation, which is commonly associated with the disease.

there are a number of significant differences between the dimer interfaces in pffesod and humnsod that may be exploited in the design of parasite selective inhibitors. residue phe <dig>  which contributes  <dig> % of the accessible surface area buried in the interface in pffesod is replaced with glutamine in the human enzyme. the intermolecular polar/salt-bridging residue pair of his <dig> and asp <dig> in pffesod is substituted by cys and pro, respectively in humnsod, similarly the glu21-arg <dig> ion pair in pffesod appears as ala and lys respectively in the human enzyme. these differences ought to be exploitable in the selective design of dimer-disrupting mutants.

inhibitors of pffesod have already been identified from a random screening of a chemical library of compounds  <cit> . a subset of these uncharged polyaromatic compounds, with molecular weights in the range 200– <dig> da, have in vitro anti-malarial activity, with ic <dig> values in the micromolar range. their mechanism of action and their selectivity was not determined so it remains to be seen whether they interfere with dimer formation. a number of small molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interactions with biomedical significance have been reported recently  <cit> . for trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite-selective inhibitor of triosephosphate isomerase has been identified and shown to act by blocking dimerisation  <cit> , so it appears that the strategy could be useful, particularly as the percentage of accessible protein surface that becomes buried in a sod dimer is at the lower limit of the range normally seen in protein multimers in nature.

CONCLUSIONS
the x-ray structure of p. falciparum sod provides the detailed template on which comparisons with human enzyme can be made, and for the design of potential parasite-specific inhibitors. in particular, the biochemical properties of the sod enzyme  suggest that a possible mode of inhibition would be to disrupt the dimer interface that may be important to its function and stability. the intra-erythocytic stages of the parasite are in an environment that is known to be rich in antioxidant defences  that might compensate an inhibitory effect. however, the selective delivery of inhibitors to the parasite organellar system may prove to be a useful route to new therapeutics.
