BACKGROUND
sheep pox and goat pox are economically important diseases in goat and sheep producing areas of the world. sheep pox and goat pox result from infection by sppv or gtpv respectively, and are closely related members of the capripoxvirus genus in the family poxviridae. clinically, sheep pox and goat pox have indistinguishable symptoms. several pcr-based assays have been reported to distinguish sppv from gtpv including cleaved amplification polymorphism sequence-tagged sites  and real-time pcr   <cit> . in our laboratory, distinction of gtpv from sppv was established via a hinf i digest of the p <dig> gene, followed by a sequence alinment of g-protein-coupled chemokine receptor  genes  <cit> . some of the advantages of qpcr include speed, sensitivity, and real time monitoring to determine exact concentrations. however, this approach requires expensive high precision instrumentation and specialized training for operation and data analysis, presenting a need for a more convenient alternative that is robust, inexpensive, and easy to operate and maintain.

recently, loop-mediated isothermal amplification  has been developed for the diagnosis of a number of diseases  <cit> . the lamp reaction can be conducted under isothermal conditions ranging 60-65°c by using four or six primers recognizing six or eight distinct regions  <cit> . lamp produces large quantities of amplified product resulting in easy visual detection either via turbidity or fluorescence  <cit> . the present study established the ability of lamp assays to differential detect gtpv and sppv through the targeting of inverted terminal repeat  sequences. compared to conventional pcr techniques, the newly established lamp assay is simple, efficient, cost-effective and convenient, making it a useful diagnostic tool for clinical samples.

RESULTS
primers and gene sequences
several gtpv and sppv genomic sequences were downloaded from genbank and aligned using megalign, with the most conserved itr segments selected as targets. all lamp primers were designed using an online software , with four primers designed for the lamp assay . these included two outer primers , a forward inner primer fip  and a backward inner primer bip .

reaction condition optimization for gtpv and sppv detection by lamp
to determine optimal reaction temperatures for each lamp primer set, the sppv genome was used as a template for the gspv and sppv primer sets and the gtpv genome used for the gtpv primer set. reaction temperatures were altered to include 60°c, 62°c, 64°c and 66°c for 60 min, followed by a 80°c heating for 2 min. two microliters of each lamp product was examined via gel electrophoresis and imaged. the results showed the gspv and gtpv primer sets could successfully amplify the target gene at all experimental temperature levels, with the exception of 66°c , while the sppv primers successfully amplified the target gene at all experimental temperature levels .

when attempting to optimize incubation time, gspv primers at 62°c were able to amplify the target gene following a 45 min or 60 min incubation, but unable to display successful amplification following a 30 min incubation . when examining gtpv primers at 62°c, only an incubation time of 60 min resulted in successful amplification , while the sppv primers displayed successful amplification during all experimental incubation periods .

lamp and pcr sensitivity for detection of gtpv and sppv
to determine the reaction sensitivity of each lamp primer set, sppv gdna  was used as a template for the gspv and sppv primer sets, while gtpv gdna was used as templates for the gtpv primer set. all template concentrations were established via nucleic acid meter measurement and the copy number calculated. sppv gdna was serially diluted to achieve  <dig>  ×  <dig> -  <dig>  ×  <dig> copies of template, while gtpv gdna was serially diluted to achieve  <dig>  ×  <dig> -  <dig>  ×  <dig> copies of template. the reaction was carried out at 62°c for 45 min or 60 min, followed by a 2 min incubation at 80°c. two microliters of each lamp product was analyzed via gel electrophoresis and uv imaged.

electrophoretic analysis of the amplification of varying template concentrations incubated for 45 min showed successful amplification when using gspv primers in conjunction with template copy numbers between  <dig>  ×  <dig> -  <dig>  ×  <dig>  while the control sample showed no banding . we can see  <dig>  ×  <dig> copies of the template be detected with general lamp gspv primers at 62°c, after amplification 45 min. when incubating for 60 min, gtpv primers were able to amplify specific products with dna template copy numbers between  <dig>  ×  <dig> -  <dig>  ×  <dig>  while the control group showed no banding  and lower dna template concentrations virtually undetectable. when examining amplification levels using sppv primers after incubation for 45 min,  amplification product was noted with dna template copy numbers between  <dig>  ×  <dig> -  <dig>  ×  <dig>  while the control group showed no banding.

lamp assay specificity
reaction specificity was determined for each lamp primer set utilizing gtpv, sppv, orf virus, fmdv, m. ovipneumoniae, chlamydia psittaci, l. interrogans, toxoplasma gondii, theileria and babesia sp templates. reactions were carried out at 62°c, while utilizing the optimized incubation time of 45 min for gspv and sppv primers and 60 min for gtpv primers, followed by a 2 min incubation at 80°c. two microliters of each lamp product was analyzed via gel electrophoresis and uv imaging.

the specificity of the lamp assay results reveal that the gspv primers could amplify the target gene in sppv and gtpv gdna, but were unable to successfully amplify orf, fmdv, m. ovipneumoniae, chlamydia psittaci, l. interrogans, toxoplasma gondii, babesia sp, theileria and the negative control sample . gtpv primers were able to amplify the target gene in gtpv gdna when incubated at 62°c for 60 min, while showing unsuccessful amplification of other pathogenic genomes . meanwhile, sppv primers could amplify the target gene in sppv gdna when incubated at 62°c for 45 min, while showing unsuccessful amplification of other genomic templates . however, all three sets of primers could amplify a large gene in the babesia sp gdna , but luckily this has no effect on the assay results. to further confirm the specificity of the amplified itr sequences, lamp products were sequenced. proceeding bioinformatic analysis, all lamp amplicons displayed 100% sequence identity to their corresponding itr sequences .

evaluation of the lamp assay
one hundred thirty-five preserved epidemic materials were evaluated to revealed  <dig> samples infected with goat pox and  <dig> infected with sheep pox . all samples were assessed using the gspv lamp diagnosis method to yield a 100% detection rate, which was consistent with the laboratory tested results. samples assessed using the gtpv lamp diagnosis method also showed a 100% detection rate in agreement with the laboratory tested results. samples evaluated using the sppv lamp method showed  <dig> positive detection results and one negative, to yield a detection rate of  <dig> %.

discussion
gtpv and sppv contain double-stranded dna genomes that are approximately  <dig> kbp and share at least  <dig> putative genes, to include conserved poxvirus replicative and structural genes and genes likely involved in virulence and host range  <cit> . restriction endonuclease analysis and cross-hybridization studies of sppv and gtpv indicate that these viruses, although closely related , can be distinguished from one another and may undergo recombination in nature  <cit> . several pcr tests have been developed for the detection of capripoxviruses <cit> . in our laboratory, distinction of gtpv from sppv was established via a hinf i digest of the p <dig> gene, followed by sequence alinment of gpcr genes  <cit> . however, these methodologies are time consuming, expensive and require experienced laboratory staff. this presents a real need for a more convenient alternative to pcr that is robust, inexpensive, and easy to operate and maintain.

lamp is a novel nucleic acid isothermal amplification technique developed by notomi  <cit>  and serves as a powerful gene amplification tool due to its high specificity and sensitivity under isothermal condition  <cit> . previous lamp methods were developed for the rapid detection of capripoxviruses <cit>  and were unable to distinguish sppv from gtpv. the present study aimed to develop a lamp method for the rapid distinction of sppv from gtpv, and to evaluate its applicability through field sample testing. lamp primer design was based on six regions in the target sequence designated from the 5’-end as f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  and b <dig> . the forward inner primer  consists of the f <dig> sequence  that is complementary to the f2c region and the same sequence as the f1c region at its 5’ end. the four key factors in the lamp primer design are the tm, primer end stability, gc content and secondary structure. tm is estimated using the nearest-neighbor method, which is an approximation method that provides values closest to the actual values. the tm for each region was determined to be ~ 65°c  for f1c and b1c, ~ 60°c  for f <dig>  b <dig>  f <dig>  and b <dig> and ~ 60°c for the loop primers. since primers serves as the starting point of dna synthesis, a certain degree of stability must be achieved. the 3’ ends of f2/b <dig>  f3/b <dig>  and lf/lb and the 5’ end of f1c/b1c were designed to have a free energy of -4 kcal/ mol or less. the 5’ end of f1c after amplification corresponds to the 3’ end of f <dig>  making its stability important. primers were designed to have gc content between ~40% to 65%, with 50% to 60% gc content optimal. it is important, particularly for inner primers, that primers are designed to eliminate the formation of secondary structures. additionally, it is important to prevent primer dimerization by ensuring that the 3’ ends are not complementary.

the most critical aspect of the current study is to design robust primers able to achieve differential detection of sppv and gtpv, thus warranting a rigorous design process. to optimize sppv primer specificity, primers comparison analysis shows that b <dig> of the sppv primers  is a characteristic sequence in the sppv genome  and does not exist in the gtpv genome. the calculated dimer  dg sppv lamp primer was - <dig>  kcal/mol, the 3’ ends of f2/b <dig> and f3/b <dig> and the 5’ end of f1c/b1c were designed to have a free energy of -4 kcal/mol or less and gc rates were around  <dig> . the calculated tm for f <dig> was  <dig>  and for b <dig> was  <dig> , making both of the tms relatively close. additionally, the calculated tm for f1c was  <dig>  and for b1c was  <dig> , yielding very close tms for both. lastly, the calculated tm for f <dig> was  <dig>  and for b <dig> was  <dig> , again yielding close tms. these indicators are more in line with the general lamp primer design requirements generating high specificity and sensitivity in theory, and which was experimentally validated. the sppv primer achieved high sensitivity and specificity in the presence of  <dig>  ×  <dig> copies of dna template.

in order to guarantee gtpv primer specificity, primer sequence specificity was assessed via comparative analysis to shows that b3/f <dig> of the gtpv primers  and b <dig> of the gtpv primers  are characteristic sequences in the gtpv genome  and does not exist in sppv genome. the designed gtpv lamp primers had higher specificity than sppv primers in theory due to a gc rate around  <dig> , the 3’ ends of f2/b <dig> and f3/b <dig> and the 5’ end of b1c were designed with a free energy of -4 kcal/mol. the calculated tm for f <dig> was  <dig>  and for b <dig> was  <dig> , making them relatively close. additionally, the calculated tm for f1c was  <dig>  and for b1c was  <dig> , also making them relatively close. lastly, the calculated tm for f <dig> was  <dig>  and for b <dig> was  <dig> , yielding very close tms. these indicators are more in line with the general lamp primer design requirements. the calculated dimer  dg gtpv lamp primer was only - <dig>  kcal/mol, and 5’ end of f1c had a free energy of only - <dig>  kcal/mol, less than the target -4 kcal/mol. these parameters should results in primers with higher specificity but lower sensitivity in theory, which was experimentally validated. the specificity of the sppv primer was high, but the sensitivity was lower as demonstrated by a need of  <dig>  ×  <dig> copies of template.

all gspv primers were designed to match all sequences characteristics in the gtpv and sppv genomes, with indicators more in line with general lamp primer design requirements. the only drawback in the design was the 5’ end of f1c having a free energy of - <dig>  kcal/mol, which was less than the ideal -4 kcal/mol, but the predicted high degree of specificity and adequate sensitivity were experimentally validated. the specificity of the gspv primers was high, in addition to achieving a high sensitivity as demonstrated by the use of  <dig>  ×  <dig> copies of template.

although the predicted sppv primer specificity could have been higher, experimentation showed its inability to produce an amplification product from other pathogenic genomes, thus confirming the ability of the sppv primer to specifically detect sppv alone. while both predictive and experimental evidence displayed a high degree of specificity in gtpv primers, but a lower sensitivity, which can be rectified through its combining with the gspv primers. in short, combining all three sets of primers enables the quick and efficient detection of gtpv and sppv. while the methods established in this study are effective, they could be further optimized by designing loop primers to further reduce experimentation time and visualization could be more streamlined through the utilization of fluorescence dyes.

in clinical samples testing found that sppv lamp primer detected miss one case which can be detected by gspv lamp primer. the possible reason is that all sppv nucleic acid concentration in the samples were within the scope of sppv detection sensitivity, but the nucleic acid content of the miss sample was smaller than the sppv lamp highest sensitivity but within gspv lamp primer detection sensitivity,. so the judgment of the samples should be to test again, or in other ways for further confirmation, and pay more attention to the concentration of the sample in the process of sample handling.

the presented experimentation has shown that the sequence of the gtpv primer can provide specificity and rapid detection of gtpv nucleic acids, but was unable to detect sppv nucleic acids under the same conditions. on the other hand, the sppv primer can provide specificity and rapid detection of sppv nucleic acids, but was unable to detect gtpv nucleic acids under the same conditions. however, the gspv primer can rapidly amplify gtpv nucleic acid and sppv nucleic acid. collectively, gspv, gtpv and sppv lamp primers when combined possess the analytical ability to fully distinguish between gtpv and sppv.

CONCLUSIONS
these laboratory studies showed that the lamp method of differential gtpv and sppv detection is inexpensive, rapid, simplistic, specific, and sensitive. these attributes make this method an optimal detection system for field detection and differential diagnosis of gtpv and sppv. it is a promising assay for extensive application and rapid diagnosis of gtpv and sppv infection in the laboratory and the field, especially in countries that lack the resources needed for molecular diagnostic techniques.
