BACKGROUND
lactation is the result of the finely orchestrated differentiation of mammary epithelial cells that gives them the ability to secrete milk. mammary epithelial cells are unique in their ability to differentiate into lactogenic phenotypes and then dedifferentiate back to a quiescent form, in response to steroid and peptide hormones . milk provides an energy source, proteins and essential nutrients for the neonate, one of the key components of which is calcium . the rapid growth of the neonate, particularly the calcification of bones and teeth, places a high demand for ca2+ in milk. depending on the species, the concentration of total ca2+ in milk ranges from  <dig> to 60 mm  <cit> , a level well above the maternal blood level of total ca2+. the secretory pathway and the apical plasma membrane play important roles in the transport of ca2+ into milk  <cit> .

despite the importance of ca2+ enrichment of milk, only recently have the ca2+ transporters responsible for the accumulation of ca2+ into milk begun to be identified. the best-characterized protein involved in the enrichment of milk with ca2+ is the plasma membrane ca2+ atpase isoform  <dig> . this calcium efflux pump has a very restricted tissue expression and is present in specific parts of the brain and the inner ear  <cit> . pmca <dig> is markedly up regulated during lactation, particularly splice variant pmca2bw  <cit> , which localizes to the apical membrane of secretory cells  <cit> . pmca <dig> null mice show a 60% reduction in milk ca2+ content, providing direct evidence for the role of pmca <dig> in the apical transport of ca2+ into milk during lactation  <cit> .

the sequestration of ca2+ into the secretory pathway during lactation appears to occur via the golgi localized pump - secretory pathway ca2+-atpase isoform  <dig> . like pmca <dig>  spca <dig> has a restricted tissue distribution  <cit>  and is significantly up regulated during lactation  <cit> . spca <dig> may also have a dual role in lactation due to its mn2+ pumping ability  <cit> . both ca2+ and mn2+ are essential for enzymes necessary for the correct post-translational modification of milk proteins and lactose production  <cit> .

several different ca2+ permeable ion channels are proposed as the mechanism by which ca2+ enters the mammary epithelial cell from the maternal blood supply during lactation. calcium channels suggested as involved in this pathway include trpv <dig> and trpv <dig>  <cit> . however, recent studies suggest that the orai <dig> calcium channel may be responsible for calcium influx into the mammary epithelial cell during lactation, since orai <dig> mrna levels increase in the mouse mammary gland during lactation  <cit> . indeed, orai <dig> is at the basolateral membrane in mammary epithelial cells  <cit> . orai <dig> is the canonical mechanism for store operated calcium entry . soce is the activation of calcium influx into the cell upon the depletion of intracellular stores of ca2+. such a mechanism could be a powerful feedback loop to balance demand  with supply . endoplasmic ca2+ store level depletion is detected by stim proteins; upon endoplasmic reticulum  ca2+ depletion, stim proteins oligomerize and localize to er-plasma membrane positions where they activate orai channels and promote soce  <cit> . the orai <dig> isoform of orai channels is up regulated in mammary gland tissue samples taken from mice at lactation  <cit> . however, levels of the canonical orai <dig> activator stim <dig> decline during lactation. the related isoform stim <dig> is suggested as the possible mechanism of activation of orai <dig> during lactation as this isoform does not decrease during lactation and is linked to the regulation of basal ca2+ influx  <cit> . studies identifying the carboxyl terminal of spca <dig> as an activator of orai <dig> and the interaction between spca <dig> and orai <dig> in mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells, suggests that the up regulation of spca <dig> may not only serve to promote ca2+ secretion during lactation, but also as an activator of ca2+ influx. however, this has not been assessed in models of lactation. another aspect of spca <dig> that has not yet been assessed in lactation is the role of the transcription factor mist <dig>  which is important in mammary gland development  <cit> . a novel, truncated form of spca <dig> was identified in mist1−/− mice, but the presence of this form of spca <dig> and its potential role in the regulation of ca2+ transport during lactation has not been assessed. in these studies we used the hc <dig> model to further explore ca2+ influx in mammary gland epithelial cells and to define the potential role of mist <dig> regulation of spca <dig> splicing during mammary gland development.

RESULTS
basal ca2+ influx is increased in differentiated hc <dig> cells
β-casein is a known marker of lactogenesis in mammary epithelial cells necessary for the binding of calcium into micelles  <cit>  and is a reliable marker in hc <dig> cells to show differentiation. hc <dig> cells were treated to induce differentiation to a lactogenic phenotype , which was assessed by the expression of β-casein at the mrna level. figure 1a demonstrates the increase in β-casein mrna through real-time rt-pcr in differentiated cells in comparison to cells kept in maintenance media in a proliferative non-differentiated state.

calcium assays were conducted to assess changes in basal ca2+ influx in response to differentiation of hc <dig> cells. basal ca2+ influx  significantly increased in differentiated cells  indicating that an increase in basal ca2+ influx accompanies β-casein induction and may be a characterizing feature of the changes associated with lactation. we then sought to determine the role of orai <dig> in this enhancement of ca2+ influx.

enhanced basal ca2+ influx in differentiated hc <dig> cells is abolished by sirna for orai1
the effect of sirna to orai <dig>  on basal ca2+ influx in proliferative and differentiated hc <dig> cells was assessed. orai <dig> silencing eliminated the augmentation of basal ca2+ influx associated with differentiation  suggesting that orai <dig> mediates this augmentation in differentiated hc <dig> cells.

stim <dig> silencing did not affect the augmented basal ca2+ influx in differentiated hc <dig> cells . treatment of hc <dig> cells with sistim <dig> did not produce a significant inhibition of ca2+ influx in differentiated cells , however the significant increase in ca2+ influx between differentiated and proliferating hc <dig> cells was abolished when cells were treated with sistim <dig> . these results suggest a major role for orai <dig> in ca2+ influx in the hc <dig> model, with a modest role for stim <dig> 

spca <dig> in hc <dig> cells and mouse mammary tissue samples
truncated and full length spca <dig> transcripts  <cit>  were assessed in proliferating and differentiated hc <dig> cells by comparing mrna levels measured at exons 15– <dig> versus exons 26– <dig>   and also in mouse mammary tissue samples isolated from virgin, mid pregnancy and lactation stages . spca <dig> mrna did not increase in the in vitro hc <dig> model and there was no change in the proportion of truncated versus full length transcripts . however, spca <dig> mrna did increase during lactation, although there was no significant difference between the different exon spanning regions of spca <dig> indicating that no truncated spca <dig> was present in any of the samples. we also assessed the levels of the transcription factor mist <dig>  which is speculated to regulate spca <dig> expression in pancreatic acinar cells  <cit> , and found that mist <dig> levels did not significantly change in differentiated hc <dig> cells . however, there was a trend of increased mist <dig> levels in mammary gland tissue samples from the lactating mice  as previously described  <cit> . mist <dig> has been detected in differentiated scp <dig> cells  <cit> . spca <dig> silencing had no significant effect on basal ca2+ influx  suggesting that in hc <dig> cells spca <dig> does not play a role in ca2+ influx regulation as suggested in other cell types  <cit> .

β-casein levels are unchanged with orai <dig> silencing
to determine if the decrease in basal ca2+ influx was an indirect result of siorai <dig> inhibition of differentiation, β-casein mrna levels were measured in siorai <dig> treated differentiated hc <dig> cells. real-time rt-pcr clearly showed that β-casein expression was not inhibited in siorai <dig> treated cells . therefore, although orai <dig> silencing abolishes the induction of increases in ca2+ influx, it does not inhibit the induction of differentiation.

orai <dig> mrna levels do not change with differentiation
given the up regulation of orai1-mediated ca2+ influx associated with differentiation in hc <dig> cells, we assessed changes in the levels of orai <dig> and its known activators. orai <dig>  mrna did not significantly change in response to differentiation. however, differentiation was associated with a modest up regulation in stim <dig> mrna , and a modest down regulation of stim <dig>  and spca <dig>  mrna levels.

discussion
the enrichment of milk with calcium is essential for the growing neonate. our understanding of the specific calcium channels and pumps that are involved in this process is gradually evolving. however, the area that is least understood in the transport of ca2+ into milk is the mechanism by which ca2+ flows from the maternal blood supply into the mammary epithelial cell. in vivo studies implicate store operated ca2+ entry as the calcium influx pathway involved, with orai <dig> mrna levels increasing in mouse mammary glands during lactation  <cit> . although orai <dig> silencing reduces ca2+ influx in human breast cancer cell lines  <cit> , no studies have directly assessed calcium influx mediated by this pathway in in vitro models of lactation. the possible roles of the orai <dig> activators stim <dig>  stim <dig> and spca <dig> have also not been assessed through direct assessment of ca2+ influx in mammary gland epithelial cells. these questions were addressed in this study.

hc <dig> cells are a mouse mammary epithelial cell line derived from comma-1d cells, isolated from mid-pregnant balb/c mice mammary glands  <cit> . unlike many other mammary cell models, hc <dig> cells do not need to be co-cultured with other cell types or with extracellular matrix proteins to help induce lactogenic differentiation  <cit> , making it suitable for the calcium influx assays used in this study. the expression of β-casein is essential for ca2+ accumulation into milk, as a significant amount of calcium is present in casein micelles  <cit> . moreover, β-casein is a marker of differentiation in hc <dig> cells  <cit> .

differentiation of hc <dig> cells with lactogenic hormones resulted in a statistically significant increase in basal ca2+ influx compared to undifferentiated controls. this result is consistent with the hypothesis that lactation is associated with the remodelling of mammary gland epithelial cells to a more ca2+ permeable phenotype associated with elevated basal ca2+ influx. this increase in ca2+ influx is likely to be required to meet the demands of the secretion and efflux of ca2+ from the mammary gland epithelial cell into milk.

silencing of orai <dig> demonstrated that this augmented ca2+ influx is via orai <dig>  since the difference in ca2+ influx between differentiated and undifferentiated hc <dig> cells was abolished with the silencing of this calcium channel. hence, consistent with elevated orai <dig> mrna levels during lactation, orai <dig> appears to be a major contributor of the enhanced basal ca2+ influx in mammary gland epithelial cells from a lactating host. orai <dig> along with its activator stim <dig> are regulators of basal ca2+ levels  <cit> . our studies now suggest that this basal influx pathway is dynamic and may be up regulated during lactation. future studies should assess how reported regulators of calcium transport during lactation, such as the calcium-sensing receptor, affect orai1-mediated calcium influx in this and other models  <cit> ).

mcandrews et al. compared 2 day  and 8 day  hc <dig> cultures and found elevated orai <dig> mrna in hc <dig> cells at 8 days of differentiation  <cit> . these studies comparing cultures at day  <dig> with and without lactogenic hormones, suggest that it may be days in culture and/or confluence, which produces an increase in orai <dig> mrna levels. lactogenic hormones may be responsible for the enhancement of orai <dig> basal activity in hc <dig> cells. orai <dig> does not appear to be a key pathway in the differentiation of hc <dig> cells given that orai <dig> silencing had no effect on β-casein levels, this is in contrast to scp <dig> cells where mammosphere formation was abolished with shorai <dig> treatment  <cit> . the lack of effects of orai <dig> silencing on β-casein levels in hc <dig> cells indicates that the decrease in basal ca2+ influx observed when orai <dig> was silenced was not simply a consequence of the inhibition of hc <dig> differentiation.

orai <dig> is activated via a number of different mechanisms including the canonical orai <dig> activator and calcium store sensor stim <dig>  its related isoform stim <dig>  and spca <dig>  stim <dig> is proposed as an orai <dig> activator in lactation due to its important role in basal influx in hela, huvec and hek293t cells  <cit> . the maintenance of stim <dig> mrna levels during lactation  <cit>  and reduction in basal cyt in differentiated hc <dig> cells with stim <dig> silencing also support this role. other mechanisms of orai <dig> activation during lactation have also been proposed, such as calcium store independent activation by spca <dig>  <cit> . specific domains of spca <dig> protein activate orai <dig>  <cit> , and spca <dig> mrna levels are pronouncedly increased during lactation  <cit> . activation of orai <dig> by spca <dig> may allow the demand for ca2+ sequestration via this secretory pathway ca2+ pump to promote the supply of ca2+ through augmentation of ca2+ influx. however, in these studies, and in contrast to orai <dig> silencing, neither stim <dig> nor spca <dig> silencing abolished the augmentation of ca2+ influx induced by differentiation of hc <dig> mammary epithelial cells. it could be that some in vitro systems have calcium influx pathways that are more sensitive to spca <dig> dependent modulation of orai <dig>  such has recently been reported in scp <dig> cells  <cit> . the ability of stim <dig> silencing to abolish the enhanced ca2+ influx associated with differentiation of hc <dig> cells, supports previous suggestions that stim <dig> is a modulator of orai <dig> during lactation, however, the inability of stim <dig> silencing to replicate the magnitude of orai <dig> silencing suggest other orai <dig> activation mechanisms. compensatory mechanisms amongst the orai <dig> activators stim <dig>  stim <dig> and spca <dig> in this model and/or other factors such as the absence of coordinated polarization of mammary gland epithelial cell may be responsible for the results reported here. further studies using 3d culture models in multiple mammary cell lines models, such as those recently published by cross et al. in spc <dig> cells  <cit> , and in vivo studies with knockout animals are required to ultimately define the specific roles of stim <dig>  stim <dig> and spca <dig> and the activation of orai <dig> in lactation.

CONCLUSIONS
the influx of ca2+ across mammary gland epithelial cells is a key step in the supply of ca2+ to the growing neonate during lactation. these studies using hc <dig> mammary gland epithelial cells are consistent with recent in vivo studies of mrna levels during mammary gland development suggesting that orai <dig> is an important pathway of ca2+ influx during lactation.
