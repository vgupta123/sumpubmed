BACKGROUND
β-galactosidases   catalyze the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds of terminal non-reducing β-d-galactosyl residues of oligosaccharides and β-d-galactopyranosides. this group of enzymes has a broad distribution, which encompasses plants, animals and microorganisms. the biological functions of these enzymes include degradation of structural polysaccharides in plant cell walls  <cit> , thereby acting to control fruit softening during ripening  <cit> , hydrolysis of dietary lactose  <cit>  and degradation of glycolipids and proteoglycans in mammals  <cit> , and metabolism of lactose and other galactosides in microorganisms  <cit> . the extensive diversity of bgals raises the question of what is the basis of their different substrate specificities, which help determine their functions.

glycosyl hydrolases  have been grouped and classified as families on the basis of structural similarity  <cit>  and bgals fall into glycosyl hydrolase  families  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which are part of superfamily a . based on amino acid sequence similarities  <cit> , plant bgals that have been described belong to gh family  <dig> . like other glycosidase families, gh <dig> includes multiple genes in various plant species, including arabidopsis  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , papaya  <cit> , apple  <cit> , vigna unguiculata  <cit>  and barley  <cit> , suggesting that gh <dig> gene multiplicity is ubiquitous in plants.

analysis of plant bgal activities led to the proposal of two classes, i and ii  <cit> . class i is made up of enzymes with well characterized exo-β--galactanase activities that can specifically act on pectic β--galactan. class ii has hydrolytic activity on the β-- and β--galactosyl linkages of arabinogalactan proteins , but lacks activity toward pectic β--galactan  <cit> , as reported in spinach leaves  <cit>  and hypocotyls and young leaves of radish  <cit> . class i osbgals can specifically act on β--galactosyl residues in pectin and xyloglucan. therefore, they could play an important role in modification of the architecture of the cell wall and intercellular attachment  <cit> . the apparent involvement of bgals in pectin disassembly during fruit ripening has been reported in various plant species, including tomato  <cit> , muskmelon  <cit> , kiwifruit  <cit> , persimmon  <cit> , sweet cherry  <cit> , mango  <cit> , and peach  <cit> . bgals expression also accompanies many stages of plant development in other tissues, for example, spinach leaves  <cit> , mungbean seedlings  <cit> , radish hypocotyls and young leaves  <cit> , and meristem zones of roots, cotyledons, vascular tissues, trichomes, and pollen of tobacco  <cit> . bgals that appear to catalyze galactose removal from xyloglucans during their disassembly were observed in cotyledons of nasturtium  seed  <cit> , copaifera langsdorffii seed  <cit> , and hymenaea courbaril seed, where they were reported to act in cooperation with α-xylosidase, β-glucosidase, and other enzymes to achieve xyloglucan degradation  <cit> . therefore, bgals appear to play a role in cell wall remodeling in many plant processes.

in rice, gh <dig> has not yet been well characterized, and the biological function of rice bgals remain mysterious. konno and tsumuki  <cit>  identified both soluble and cell-wall-bound bgal, of which a  <dig> kda soluble bgal was purified and shown to release galactose from larch wood and rice cell wall arabinogalactans. likewise, kaneko and kobayashi  <cit>  isolated a bgal with  <dig> and  <dig> kda subunits from the medium of rice suspension cells. recently, chantarangsee et al.  <cit>  characterized two recombinant bgal isozymes, including the  <dig> kda osbgal <dig> and  <dig> kda osbgal <dig>  which had different expression patterns, though both are found throughout plant growth. the complete rice genome sequence allows extensive study of rice gh <dig>  so the gene structures, encoded protein sequences and phylogenetic relationships with other bgals from rice and other organisms, which may provide clues to their evolution and possible functions, were determined. in addition, the transcript expression patterns of all rice gh <dig> bgals have been determined and osbgal <dig> was expressed in escherichia coli to gain a clue to osbgal physiological functions.

RESULTS
identification of rice gh <dig> genes and their protein products
a total of  <dig> gh <dig> genes  were identified in rice genome databases , each of which encodes a protein that contains the gh <dig> β-galactosidase active site consensus sequence g-g-p- -x-q-x-e-n-e-   <cit> . most of the encoded proteins contain a gh <dig> domain at the n-terminus and a gal-lectin-like domain at the c-terminus. although the speculated carbohydrate-binding function of these gal-lectin domains is not yet proven, their existence and conserved nature has led to the suggestion that they may increase the catalytic efficiency on polysaccharide substrates  <cit> . the proteins from osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig> lack the gal-lectin-like domain, suggesting that it is not necessary for the functions of these rice gh <dig> members.

the deduced amino acid sequences of the osbgal proteins were used to predict their putative signal peptides, protein lengths, molecular masses, pi values, possible n-glycosylation sites, and cellular destinations . all osbgals contain putative signal peptides, which range in length from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, except for that of osbgal <dig> which is predicted to have  <dig> amino acids. the mature osbgal proteins were predicted to contain from  <dig>  to  <dig>  amino acids, corresponding to molecular masses of  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda. most of the proteins were predicted to have pi in the acidic range , except those of osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig> are in the basic range  . only osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig> lacked putative n-glycosylation sites, while the other enzymes were predicted to contain from  <dig> to  <dig> sites. most osbgal members are predicted to localize to the organelles of the secretory pathway, for instance, the golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, or vacuole, or to be secreted. only  <dig> osbgals, including osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig>  were predicted to be localized in the lysosome-like vacuole, which correlates to the location of mammalian β-galactosidases in the lysosome . although osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig> are very similar in predicted mature protein length and possible cellular destinations, their predicted pi values are quite different. osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig> all have high numbers of glycosylation sites, similar mw, pi and predicted possible destinations, which suggests that they may have redundant or overlapping functions.

phylogenetic analysis
the multiple alignment of full-length protein sequences was used to construct an unrooted phylogenetic tree. the phylogenetic tree, which includes all the gh <dig> genes identified in the rice , a. thaliana  and physcomitrella patens  genomes, as well as representatives of animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and eubacteria, has three major branches, one of which is nearly plant specific , one of which contains representatives of animals, eubacteria and plants, and one of which contains archaeal, eubacterial and fungal enzymes . almost all the rice, a. thaliana, and p. patens enzymes fall within the plant-specific cluster, except osbgal <dig>  atbgal <dig> and p. patens edq <dig>  which fall in the cluster with animal β-galactosidases. previously, it was suggested that the plant enzymes that cluster with animals might have been transferred to plants by horizontal gene transfer  <cit> , but the fact that the bryophyte, which is thought to have diverged from the vascular plants early in plant evolution, has this type of β-galactosidase and the broad distribution of organisms with this type of β-galactosidase suggest that plants maintained a copy of this gene when plants and animals diverged. perhaps the more relevant question is how the plant specific bgal ancestor came to be, and how the c-terminal gal-lectin-like domain was acquired by this lineage. it appears that the fungal-type and plant-type lineages may have diverged from the animal-type β-galactosidases early in gh <dig> evolution, but plants retained the animal-type β-galactosidase, as well.

within the plant-type β-galactosidases, osbgals can be divided into three distinct groups . the major group  contains  <dig> clusters with total  <dig> osbgal members. the cluster a <dig> contains  <dig> rice genes, including osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  and osbgal <dig>  along with  <dig> atbgals, the asparagus officinalis bgal, and  <dig> tomato and  <dig> chickpea bgals that are not shown, some of which contain c-terminal galactose-binding lectin-like domains and some of which do not. another cluster, a <dig>  contains osbgal <dig>  atbgal <dig> and two putative p. patens bgals , which suggests this cluster is of ancient origin. two other putative p. patens bgals fall in cluster a <dig>  which appears to be closely related to cluster a <dig>  osbgal <dig> groups with atbgal <dig> and rsbgal <dig> of radish, which specifically hydrolyzes the β-- and β--linked oligogalactans of agps  <cit> , in subsgroup a <dig>  osbgal <dig> groups with atbgal <dig> in cluster a <dig>  the second biggest group, b, contains  <dig> rice bgals with high amino acid sequence similarity, namely osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  and osbgal <dig>  these isozymes have nearly the same protein lengths and gene structures, as described below. within group c, osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig>  are closely related, while osbgal <dig>  is less clearly associated, though both distance-based and maximum parsimony trees back this model.

chromosomal locations of osbgals
as shown in the map of their chromosomal locations and directions of transcription in figure  <dig>  the osbgals are distributed over all chromosomes, except chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  three osbgals are located on chromosome  <dig>  while  <dig> osbgal each are found on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and one osbgal each is present on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  similar to other gene families, osbgals appear to have undergone gene duplication, as the rice genome has undergone genome-wide duplication events, including polyploidy, which promote the amplification of gene family members. segmental duplication analysis identified four osbgals located on the duplicated segmental regions in rice chromosomes. osbgal <dig>  and osbgal <dig>  are located on a chromosomal segment duplicated between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  while osbgal <dig>  and osbgal <dig>  are located on segments duplicated between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  these duplications are supported by the close phylogenetic relationships of these genes. therefore, chromosomal segment duplication appears to have played a role in multiplication of osbgals within the rice genome. in contrast, osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig>  which have high sequence similarity, are located close together on the same chromosome. thus, these two genes may have diverged by tandem duplication.

exon-intron organization and primary gene structure analysis
automated annotations for all osbgal genes were available in the public databases, except for osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig>  however, we confirmed and corrected exon-intron organization manually by comparing the corresponding full length cdna and est sequences, which were either already available in publicly accessible databases or were obtained during this study, with genomic sequences.

gene structure comparisons showed eight different splicing patterns. the sizes of the majority of the coding exons are conserved, but some appear to have had intron-loss events . the pattern with the highest number of exons, found in osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig>  contains  <dig> exons with  <dig> introns, with exons  <dig> through  <dig> encoding the gh <dig> domain, and exons  <dig> and  <dig> encoding the gal-lectin-like domain. ahn et al  <cit>  observed this same pattern in a. thaliana bgals and surmised from parsimony that it is likely to be the ancestral gene pattern and other patterns were derived from it, mainly by intron loss. the presence of this pattern in diverse rice genes and in a p. patens gene  supports this conclusion. the second most similar pattern is  <dig> exons separated by  <dig> introns with the loss of intron  <dig>  which occurred in osbgal <dig>  a pattern of two-intron loss was found in osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  and osbgal <dig>  which contain  <dig> exons with the loss of introns  <dig> and  <dig> 

the osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig> genes all lack the galactose-binding, lectin-like domain at the c-terminus, however, their splicing patterns were different. osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig> have patterns similar to other rice gh <dig> genes and retain the 5' end of exon  <dig>  but osbgal <dig> contains  <dig> exons with the loss of introns  <dig> and  <dig>  while intron  <dig> has been lost in osbgal <dig>  leaving  <dig> exons . in contrast, osbgal <dig> appeared to be distantly diverged from other rice gh <dig> members since its exon/intron organization does not correspond to the other osbgals, except that an intron is found in the same position as intron  <dig> in the other genes.

although the pattern and lengths of exons in rice gh <dig> genes are similar, osbgal <dig> spans approximately  <dig>  kb, because it contains over three-fold longer introns than the other genes in the family. long terminal repeat -retrotransposons elements and other repeated sequences were found within osbgal <dig> gene introns  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which contain one gc rice region, three at rich regions and eight transposable elements . likewise, osbgal <dig>  the second largest osbgal gene due to its long  intron  <dig>  had one at rich region and seven transposable elements, all of which were located within intron  <dig>  in osbgal genes of normal length, such as osbgal <dig>  no transposable elements were observed. these results may reflect the observation that rice genome expansion is forced by transposable element amplification  <cit> .

repeatmasker  was used to identify these sequences.

comparison of gene splice patterns and phylogenetic relationships between plant-type bgals from rice, a. thaliana, and p. patens reveals that, although the ancestral gene pattern is the same, no other splice patterns are shared within a phylogenetic lineage. therefore, though most introns appear to have been inserted in the common ancestor gene for this lineage , intron losses appear to have occurred independently in rice, arabidopsis and p. patens. the same may be true for the c-terminal domain, which appears to have been lost only once in rice , though it appears to have been lost at least  <dig> times in arabidopsis gh <dig> bgals  <cit> .

analysis of expression by rt-pcr
osbgal transcript expression in various tissues and stages of growth was analyzed by rt-pcr with primers specific to the 3'utr of each gene to gain further insight into possible functions. the relative expression levels derived from normalization with the ubq <dig> polyubiquitin gene gave the same patterns as those shown for normalization with the β-actin gene in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  indicating the patterns likely reflect the expression of the osbgal genes, rather than that of the control.

the rice tissues/organs and developmental stages chosen for rt-pcr analysis are shown in figure  <dig>  all  <dig> osbgal genes were found to be expressed with different but overlapping expression patterns, confirming that all genes are active. these relative expression levels were used to define genes as having expression specific to a given tissue, if the relative transcript levels of the gene at that stage are significantly higher  over the levels at all other stages. the expression profiles revealed that at least  <dig> genes were highly expressed in one of the stages of vegetative tissues and  <dig> were highly expressed in reproductive tissues. only osbgal <dig> appears to be expressed in nearly every organ and developmental stage, though at different levels .

nine osbgals  displayed their highest transcript levels in young and early-mature stages of shoot, root, and leaf sheath. among these genes, osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig> showed highest intensity in leaf sheath at different times, especially, 15-day and 1-month old, which are both fast cell elongation stages. the high accumulation of osbgals in this stage may act in sugar remodeling, since the carbohydrate remobilized from the leaf sheath and culm to grain can contribute as much as 38% to rice yield  <cit> . in contrast, low levels of most gene transcripts were detected in leaf blade, except for osbgal <dig> transcripts, which were detected throughout the growth of the blade.

six genes, osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  and osbgal <dig> appear to be expressed primarily in reproductive tissues. the relative transcript levels for these genes were at least five times higher in reproductive tissues than in vegetative tissues . in addition, no expression was detected at the initiating panicle stage, but it was high in later panicle development and flowering stages. only osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig> transcripts were found to accumulate in anther. these genes appear to have diverged from two ancestor genes, since osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  and osbgal <dig> have sequences and gene structures that are similar to each other, as do osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig> . interestingly, atbgal <dig> and atbgal <dig>  which fall into the group b with osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  and osbgal <dig> , were reported to function in the early stages of microspore and pollen development  <cit> . likewise, atbgal <dig> and atbgal <dig>  which fall in cluster c <dig> with osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig> , show maximum expression in mature pollen  <cit> . so, related rice and arabidopsis bgals function in reproductive tissues, suggesting their roles may be somewhat conserved in the two plants.

only the osbgal <dig> transcript was expressed abundantly in seed at the imbibition stage, while osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig> were also present at low levels. five osbgals were expressed in milk grain and six in grain during dry down. a high abundance of osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig> transcripts was observed in grain during dry down. this evidence implies that they may function in grain development and senescence or are stored for roles in germination, such as cell wall remodeling. osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  and osbgal <dig> transcripts were also found in shoots and roots of seedlings after germination. chantarangsee et al.  <cit>  reported β-galactosidase activity in rice seeds, roots and shoots at 0– <dig> days after seed-soaking, and detected osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig> proteins in embryos and seedling roots and shoots. in barley , giannakouros and colleagues  <cit>  were able to separate  <dig> isozymes of β-galactosidase from germinated grain. thus, bgals are present and may play roles in the growth and emergence of root and shoot primordia from the hull.

to complement the rt-pcr expression profiles of the osbals, ests retrieved from the unigene database  were compared with our findings. full-length or partial cdna and ests for most osbgals are available in the database, except osbgal <dig>  for which only one est from unspecified tissues is available, and osbgal <dig>  for which no corresponding ests or cdna are available . however, the other osbgal genes had cdna and ests present in the database, with numbers of ests that varied from  <dig> to  <dig> 

the osbgal <dig>  has the highest number of ests in the database:  <dig> ests from various tissues, including flower, stem, leaf, panicle, root, callus, seed, whole plant and unspecified tissues. the unigene profiles indicate relatively abundant accumulation in flower, leaf, panicle, root, seed and stem with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transcripts per million , respectively . the unigene profile is somewhat similar to the rt-pcr pattern of osbgal <dig>  in which the transcripts accumulated significantly throughout rice plant, including in seed during dry-down, but not in seedling and milk grain.

osbgal <dig> , osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  and osbgal <dig>  expression data included mainly flower and panicle clones, or had relatively high expression in these tissues, which correlates to our rt-pcr analysis. for instance,osbgal <dig> shows  <dig> tpm in flower and  <dig> tpm in panicle, while osbgal <dig> shows  <dig> tpm in flower .

the est and cdna clones for the remaining osbgals had diverse origins, which is consistent with the evaluation of osbgals by rt-pcr, though the frequencies of expression derived from these two forms of expression data were not exactly the same. therefore, unigene database analysis could be used for an initial guideline of gene expression, though the expression patterns based on ests are fragmentary, since the tissues are not equally or completely represented and the source tissue annotation of many est libraries is unclear or incomplete. microarray experiments, such as that by ma et al.  <cit> , who assessed expression of  <dig>  non cross-hybridizing gene models in rice seedling shoots, tillering-stage shoots and roots, heading and filling stages of panicles and suspension cells, offer a more comprehensive picture of gene expression within a tissue. although the tissue coverage in public microarray databases is as yet limited, the geo expression data in table  <dig> shows that osbgal expression levels may be affected by many treatments.

rice β-galactosidase cdnas sequencing and identification of alternative splicing
although the expression of all osbgals can be observed by rt-pcr and most have corresponding cdnas and ests in the database, complete full-length cdna clones were not available for osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig>  therefore, to confirm the mrna sequence and gene structure, these genes were amplified by pcr and sequenced. the accession numbers for these sequences are listed in table  <dig> 

the full-length cdna of osbgal <dig> was amplified by a set of primers corresponding to the transcribed locus xm_ <dig>  the cdna was isolated from 15-day leaf sheaths, a tissue with abundant expression, and exerting panicles, a tissue with poor expression, based on rt-pcr expression analysis. sequencing of the cdna from the highly expressing tissue revealed an open reading frame  of  <dig>  nucleotides encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids , which confirmed the our predicted β-galactosidase sequence from chromosome  <dig> . a search through the dbest database of o. sativa found 99% identity with a  <dig> bp est from fertile panicle . on the contrary, the os bgal <dig> cdna amplified from exerting panicle, where expression is low, contains only  <dig>  bp  which is  <dig> bp shorter than the cdna from high expression tissues. the open reading frame beginning at the initiation codon of this transcript covers only exons  <dig> to  <dig> and encodes only  <dig> amino acids. alternative splicing of this transcript occurred to utilize an alternative acceptor site   <dig> nt downstream of functional acceptor site for intron  <dig>  which introduced a deletion of  <dig> amino acid and a frameshift that leads to an in-frame stop codon . a second missplicing of this gene occurred at the intron 10/exon  <dig> junction, which again used an alternate acceptor site  located  <dig> nt downstream of the regular acceptor site. so, alternative splicing is likely to be one of the gene regulation mechanisms, since the transcript would be subject to nonsense mediated decay   <cit>  and the protein produced would be useless as a β-galactosidase.

osbgal <dig>  is annotated as a pseudogene in genbank, because of its apparent inability to produce full-length protein due to a frameshift and subsequent stop codon in the ak <dig> cdna. we hypothesized that such phenomenon probably resulted from missplicing, as seen in osbgal <dig>  a 1343-nucleotide fragment from the 3' half of the osbgal <dig> cdna was amplified from exerting panicle , in which its expression is high based on rt-pcr. this cdna shares 98% identity with the ak <dig> cdna, but had a substitution of  <dig> nucleotides in place of  <dig> nucleotides at positions  <dig> to  <dig> of ak <dig>  these substituted sequences allow the full-length translation of the predicted  <dig> amino acids of osbgal <dig>  whereas only  <dig> amino acids are translated from ak <dig>  comparison with the genomic sequence and our amplified cdna sequence indicates that the ak <dig> transcript results from retention of intron  <dig>  which extends exon  <dig> by  <dig> nt, thereby introducing an in-frame stop codon. in addition, an alternative donor site located at the functional acceptor site of intron  <dig> and the first nucleotide of the functional exon  <dig> produces an alternate intron  <dig> with the acceptor site located  <dig> nt downstream, within the functional exon  <dig>  thereby reducing the size of exon  <dig>  the shortened  protein, includes all of the catalytic domain, based on the penicillium sp. β-galactosidase structure  <cit> , so it is possible that it could still function as a bgal.

no experimentally determined cdna or ests corresponding to osbgal <dig> were available in public databases, despite the fact that our rt-pcr demonstrated its expression. therefore, the full-length osbgal <dig> cdna was amplified, cloned and sequenced. the osbgal <dig> cdna sequence  contains a 2487-nucleotide orf, which encodes  <dig> amino acids. the encoded protein shares over 99% identity with a predicted β-galactosidase of oryza sativa  , except that  <dig> extra amino acid residues were inserted at residue  <dig>  compared to the predicted sequence from ap <dig>  therefore, the correct splice donor site of exon  <dig> is located  <dig> nucleotides downstream of that predicted for the mrna of ap <dig> 

the alternative splicing observed in this study introduces in-frame stop codons into the mrna of osbgal <dig> in the low expression tissue, but not for the high expression tissues, while it can also introduce a premature stop codon in osbgal <dig>  based on the ak <dig> cdna sequence. in vertebrates, there are a number of well-known alternatively splicing genes, for instance the fibronectin gene, which can generate over  <dig> different proteins, some of which have different patterns of localization and slightly different functions in human cells  <cit> . until relatively recently, there were very few examples of alternatively spliced genes in higher plants and still fewer examples known to generate functionally distinct proteins. generally, alternative splicing yields two polypeptides of different size that are identical, except for the presence of a number of additional amino acids at the c-terminus of the larger isoform, eg., ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase  activase  <cit> ; diacylglycerol kinase in tomato  <cit> ; and chloroplast ascorbate peroxidase in spinach  <cit> . missplicing events were observed in maize  viviparous  <dig>  transcripts, the majority of which are spliced incorrectly and contain insertions of intron sequences or deletions of coding region, so that they do not encode full-length proteins  <cit> . although alternative splicing is a widespread process used in higher eukaryotes to regulate gene expression and functional diversification of proteins  <cit> , the putative control of tissue-specific expression by missplicing we observed has not been well characterized in rice.

preliminary characterization of osbgal13
osbgal <dig> is in cluster a <dig> of group a of the phyloenetic tree in figure  <dig>  along with atbgal <dig> and two p. patens bgals. this and its general expression pattern suggest it may have a conserved maintenance function in plants. to assess what its function might be, osbgal <dig> was expressed as a thioredoxin fusion protein in escherichia coli strain origamib , which we previously found to have little background β-galactosidase acitivity  <cit> . the protein was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography on nickel resin, and most of the osbgal <dig> activity eluted in 5– <dig> mm imidazole. further purification was achieved by gel filtration chromatography and the activity of the resulting protein was assessed. as shown in table  <dig>  among p-nitrophenol  glycosides, the osbgal <dig> enzyme had highest activity toward pnp-β-d-galactoside , but also had 30% of this activity toward pnp-α-l-arabinoside , and low activity toward pnp-β-d-fucoside and pnp-β-d-mannoside, but no detectable activity toward pnp-β-d-glucoside and pnp-β-d-xyloside and negligible activity toward pnp-α-d-galactoside. osbgal <dig> also hydrolyzed β--, β-- and β--linked galactobiose and galactotriose, but no release of galactose or arabinose could be detected when the protein was incubated for  <dig> h with rice seedling alcohol insoluble residue , larchwood arabinogalactan, galactan, apple pectin, citrus pectin or oat xylan. so, despite the intriguing observation that osbgal <dig> can hydrolyze both β-d-galactosyl residues and α-l-arabinosyl residues, components of type i and ii arabinogalactans and xyloglucan and glucuronoarabinoxylan side chains  <cit> , only short galacto-oligosaccharides can be identified as possible natural substrates to date.

n.d. means not detectable. * for β- <dig> -galactotriose and β- <dig> -galactobiose transglycosylation was observed as much or more than hydrolysis.

possible functions of other isozymes
the activity of mammal β-galactosidase specifically releases terminal β-galactosyl residues from glycosaminoglycans and the glycolipid gm <dig> ganglioside. similarly, the digestion of the galactolipid monogalactosyldiacylglyerol by vacuolar and chloroplast β-galactosidases was reported in wheat  <cit> . likewise, β-galacosidase of tomato was reported to act in galactolipid turnover and degradation, which occurs in chloroplasts and chromoplasts during tomato fruit development  <cit> . however, relatively little is known about metabolism of other glycolipids, glycopoteins and proteoglycans involving plant β-galactosidases, though it is well characterized in mammals. the fact that osbgal <dig> is similar to animal β-galactosidases and is predicted to localize to a lysosome-like vacuole, suggests it may play a similar role in rice.

among the plant-like osbgals, osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig> are also predicted to localize to lysosome-like vacuoles, so they could also play a role similar to animal-type β-galactosidases. however, these closely related isozymes have reproductive tissue specific expression, as are the isozymes of cluster b, osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig>  similarly, atbgal <dig> and atbgal <dig>  which clustered in group c <dig> with osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig>  and atbgal <dig> and atbgal <dig>  which clustered in group b, were found to be expressed in flower  <cit>  and pollen  <cit> . it may be that the ancestral genes for these enzymes developed reproductive-tissue specific roles before the ancestors of monocots and dicots diverged. if these functions are conserved, these isozymes may have similar roles in the two plants, though these functions remain to be determined.

among the other plant-like genes, it is likely many of them act in cell wall metabolism, but these roles are yet to be discerned. osbgal <dig> was shown to hydrolyze β--, β-- and β--linked oligosaccharides and, at a low level, arabinogalactan and be expressed in a range of vegetative and reproductive tissues  <cit> , so it may have a general role on similar substrates in the cell wall. osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig> are closely related to it, as are  <dig> tomato bgals involved in fruit ripening  <cit>  and an asparagus bgal thought to act in senescence  <cit> , so a cell wall function seems likely for these other cluster c <dig> isozymes as well, though such a role must be proven. kaneko and kobayashi  <cit>  showed that osbgal <dig>  which is secreted from rice tissue culture cells, could release galactose from galactoxyloglucans and pectic galactans. so, a role in cell wall metabolism is quite likely for this group a isozyme.

the role of osbgal <dig> remains obscure, as no closely related enzyme has been characterized, however it seems to be specific to vegetative tissues of the young plant. the fact that the transcript found in panicle was misspliced to prevent production of active enzyme is intriguing, but the functional implications of the alternative splicing of both osbgal <dig> and osbgal <dig> remain to be clarified.

CONCLUSIONS
fifteen rice glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig> genes encoding putative β-galactosidases were identified in this study. this number is similar to the  <dig> seen in arabidopsis and these plants appear to contain  <dig> common gene lineages present in their ancestors before they diverged  <cit> . osbgal <dig> was clustered into the same group as bgals from animal species, such as h. sapiens and d. melanogaster in the phylogenetic tree, while the other rice bgals fall in a nearly plant-specific subfamily of bgals, most of which contain a c-terminal lectin-like domain. the presence of both types of β-galactosidase in the moss p. patens, a nonvascular plant, suggests that both types of genes were present early in plant evolution. within the plant-type bgals, group a , contains  <dig> osbgals and many bgals that have been characterized from other plants , including some with and some without c-terminal galactose-binding-lectin-like domains. many of these proteins, including osbgal <dig>  <cit> , appear to act on the cell-wall-derived substrates. the isozymes of phylogenetic groups b and c <dig>  osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  osbgal <dig>  and osbgal <dig>  appear to have reproductive-tissue specific functions, while osbgal <dig>  is predominantly in young leaves and roots. osbgal <dig> appeared to undergo alternative splicing to prevent its production in panicle, and alternative splicing was also found for osbgal <dig>  understanding the functions of this gene family and significance of alternative splicing in this will require further functional investigation.
