BACKGROUND
the commercial strawberry   is a popular fresh and processed fruit with substantial value worldwide. it is recognized for its sweet flavors and appealing aromas. the volatile profiles of strawberry are relatively complicated among berries, with over  <dig> volatile compounds reported  <cit> . a reduced set of approximately  <dig> volatiles are commonly reported to be important components of strawberry flavor  <cit> . the principle flavor compounds include esters  <cit> , ketones, terpenes  <cit> , furanones  <cit> , aldehydes  <cit> , alcohols, and sulfur-containing compounds. the concentrations of individual volatiles are highly dependent on species  <cit> , environment and harvest date  <cit> ,  <cit> , cultivar, postharvest treatment and fruit developmental stage  <cit> .

one important volatile compound is γ-decalactone . this volatile is described as “fruity”, “sweet”, or “peachy”  <cit>  and contributes to fruit aroma  <cit> . the volatile tends to be undetectable in some genotypes  <cit> , while in others its accumulation varies greatly within and between harvest seasons  <cit> . this pattern suggests that a critical biosynthetic step or substrate may be missing or limited, and under strong environmental influence. the high variability may be due to differences in expression of genes encoding enzymes linked to the process. the observation that some genotypes never produce the compound when others do presents an excellent basis to use global transcriptome profiling to identify candidate genes associated with is production or stability. because the commercial strawberry is octoploid, f <dig> progeny from a volatile producer and a non-producer have led to predictions about inheritance of a given volatile  <cit> .

a number of researchers have used genomics approaches to identify marker-trait associations in polyploids using snps. advances in marker discovery have been made in allohexaploid wheat  cultivars using the illumina goldengate assay  <cit> , allohexaploid oat  using roche  <dig> sequencing  <cit> , and allotetraploid oilseed rape  using illumina solexa sequencing  <cit> . other approaches have focused on developmental changes in the transcriptome associated with ripening to identify gene candidates. this strategy was effective for grape  using illumina sequencing  <cit> , and recently in peach  using microarrays  <cit> .

the goal of this work is to use a transcriptome-based approach to identify the genes required for γ-d production. the approach leverages the presence/absence nature of γ-d from specific genotypes, its predictable inheritance, environmental lability, and variation during the growing season. the analysis identified one transcript from a narrow set of gene candidates that is functionally related to genes implicated in biosynthesis of this compound in certain fungi  <cit>  and the related compound γ-dodecalactone  <cit> . a pcr-based amplicon corresponding to the candidate sequence co-segregates with the volatile in a breeding population, corresponding backcrosses, and in select cultivars and wild accessions. we demonstrate that computational bulking of rnaseq data based on the presence or absence of a volatile can identify transcripts likely playing a direct role in volatile production.

RESULTS
the gene segregating with the presence of the γ-d volatile has been shown to segregate as a single dominant locus, making it a prime candidate for the approach outlined in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  briefly, a cross was constructed between elyana, a γ-d producing cultivar, and mara des bois, a cultivar where γ-d has not been detected. progeny were grown, and fruits from each individual plant were analyzed for volatiles and coincident gene expression. the fruits from each plant were analyzed and sequenced separately so that transcriptomes from producers and non-producers could be bulked computationally, with the hypothesis that candidate genes would be common to producers, while being expressed low levels or go undetected in non-producers. results could be experimentally validated in the parental lines and in segregating progeny using gene expression analysis.

γ-d quantity is genetically and environmentally influenced
the first tests examined γ-d accumulation in the ‘elyana’ and ‘mara des bois’ parental lines and representative progeny over a growing season, using detection by gcms. genotypes were assayed for γ-d production on three harvest dates. the data are presented in figure  <dig>  showing data for a single genotype representing each of five general trends. approximately 50% of the progeny produced no γ-d, similar to ‘mara des bois’. the largest portion of the γ-d producers followed a similar trend to ‘elyana’, with higher amounts in the second harvest compared to the first and third harvests. the reciprocal trend was observed in five genotypes that showed less γ-d during the second harvest compared to the other two harvests. three genotypes examined produced the highest amount in the first harvest, yet levels remained low the second and third harvests. a single genotype exhibited higher levels as the season progressed. these same volatile patterns were also observed in backcross progeny during the 2012/ <dig> season . while there is an approximately three-fold difference in accumulation in the ‘elyana’ background over the season, no γ-d was ever detected in ‘mara des bois’ above background noise.

γ-decalactone estimation
the levels of γ-d were estimated by comparing amounts detected in berries from the population using gcms, with standards derived by adding the pure volatile to half-ripe strawberry fruit. figure  <dig> shows the γ-d volatile phenotype for a subset of the ‘elyana’ x ‘mara des bois’ progeny. the top producing  <dig> genotypes from the 2012/ <dig> season ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm γ-d .

transcriptome profiling
fourteen progeny and both parents were individually analyzed by rna-seq. the γ-d non-producers included in this analysis included ‘mara des bois’,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the producers were ‘elyana’,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  many of the producers had higher γ-d levels than the ‘elyana’ γ-d positive parent . the transcriptomes from individual lines were computationally pooled based on “producer” or “non-producer”. over  <dig> million mid-tagged rnaseq reads were generated from each of the parents and progeny. the average number of filtered and mapped reads per genotype was  <dig>  million per genotype and ranged from  <dig> million to  <dig>  million. both parents had more than  <dig> million filtered, mapped reads.

approximately  <dig>  out of ~ <dig>  annotated genes in the strawberry draft genome  <cit>  were represented in the rna-seq dataset. a cursory snp search identified over  <dig>  million snps total when compared to the f. vesca genome .

gene expression trends in parental lines
alignment of all reads against the diploid f. vesca genome produced transcript assemblies that provided cursory detail of gene expression difference between the two parental genotypes. comparisons of differentially-expressed transcripts, including transcripts with low rpkm representation, between the ‘mara des bois’ and ‘elyana’ parents showed that among the  <dig>  transcripts predicted from assembly of all reads,  <dig>  were unique to the ‘mara des bois’ parent and  <dig>  were only observed in ‘elyana’ . when transcripts composed of higher rpkm values were compared there were  <dig> that had a 5-fold or greater abundance in ‘mara des bois’ and  <dig> that had a >5-fold abundance in ‘elyana’. when grouped by go function the differentially expressed genes show no clear pattern  favoring any one category.

table  <dig> shows twelve transcripts that were the most abundant in the γ-d producing parent. the highest expressed was an omega-6-fatty acid desaturase transcript , followed by a transcript annotated as osmotin stress/defense . the set also includes two serine-threonine protein kinases , citrate synthase , an f-box protein , a proline transport protein , and several uncharacterized, hypothetical proteins.

transcripts here represent those that are correlate best with accumulation of gamma-decalactone .

computational bulking to limit candidate set
the large number of differentially-expressed transcripts could be further narrowed by analyzing transcript patterns for these genes in progeny segregating for γ-d. pairwise comparisons were made between genotypes with high  and non-detectable  γ-d levels. gene candidates were filtered to have a modest >4-fold increase in transcript support of producers over non-producers. using this approach, a single gene candidate was identified, gene <dig> on linkage group  <dig> , the same abundant transcript shown in table  <dig> as variable between the two parents. to illustrate how the integration of segregating progeny can separate out transcripts not common to γ-d volatile producers, all transcripts from the “lipids” category are shown in figure 3c from the parental genotypes and several of their progeny. in general, lipid related transcripts show limited differential accumulation between any genotypes. the clear exception is the omega-6-fatty-acid desaturase  which is not detected in ‘mara des bois’  and in three of the progeny . the γ-d volatile was not detected in these same genotypes. of all candidates from table  <dig>  the omega-6-fatty-acid desaturase was the only transcript that correlated 100% with the ability to produce γ-d. the gene was given the designation fafad <dig>  a  <dig>  bp open reading frame was cloned from ‘elyana’ cdna .

validation of key candidates
the steady-state transcript accumulation of fafad <dig> , gene <dig> , and gene <dig>  was tested. the results for fafad <dig> and facytp <dig> are not consistent with the ability to produce γ-d, and were therefore de-prioritized as candidates. the qrt-pcr results for fafad <dig> visually correlated more closely with the volatile phenotype than the rna-seq rpkm values. both methods were similar in failure to detect transcript support for fafad <dig> in γ-d non-producers.

candidate genes in fruit developmental series
an ‘elyana’ fruit series was tested for ripening induction of fafad <dig>  fafad <dig>  and facytp <dig> as shown in figure  <dig>  the fold-change in transcript abundance for each gene is shown for ripe fruit compared to blushing fruit. facytp <dig> showed a >11-fold increase  in transcript abundance between ripe and blushing fruit. fafad <dig> showed a >21-fold increase  in transcript abundance. fafad <dig> was not ripening induced. these results were consistent over at least three independent biological replicates.

candidate genes and two environments
environmental fluctuation of γ-d accumulation is shown in figure  <dig>  to test if fafad <dig> matched this pattern, transcript abundance was examined in tissues obtained from two different harvests. the population average for all γ-d producers in environment “a” was approximately eleven-fold less than the population average for γ-d in environment “b”. γ-d non-producers had levels of γ-d only consistent with noise during either harvest, but γ-d producers showed high environmental effects. figure 6a shows the γ-d accumulation for four genotypes  in these two environments. figure 6b shows the qrt-pcr results for these genotypes in the two environments when transcript abundance in environment “b” was compared to environment “a”. only modest increases are shown for genotypes  <dig>   <dig>  and ‘elyana’ with genotype  <dig>  showing no evidence for fafad <dig> transcript accumulation.

molecular basis of γ-decalactone loss-of-function
the lack of detectable transcript in the ‘mara des bois’ parent and in specific progeny may be due to at least one of two factors. first, that transcription/mrna accumulation of the candidate fafad <dig> is blocked. alternatively the functional gene or allele may be missing altogether. to test these possibilities several primer pairs were designed to amplify the genomic sequence upstream and internal to fafad <dig>  a map of the genomic region and the corresponding primer pairs is provided in figure  <dig>  in all cases, none of the primer pairs could amplify products from genotypes unable to produce γ-d, while amplicons across the region were produced from every plant where γ-d was detected.

γ-decalactone marker in three populations
the ability to amplify a product specifically in γ-d producing genotypes provided an opportunity to design a gene-based molecular marker. a γ-d pcr-based assay was designed using fafad <dig> primers and then tested against three populations. the first was a subset of  <dig> genotypes from the original ‘elyana’ x ‘mara des bois’ f <dig> population . the presence of the 500 bp pcr amplicon  was detected exclusively in genotypes shown to produce γ-d. the positive pcr control  is shown by the dashed line arrow. the second and third populations tested were bc <dig> crosses to the ‘elyana’ and ‘mara des bois’ parents with progeny  <dig> as the male in each case. the ‘elyana’ backcross contained  <dig> progeny, each with at least three harvests during the 2012/ <dig> growing season. the marker co-segregated with the phenotype in all cases. twenty-two progeny in the ‘mara des bois’ backcross had at least three volatile harvests during the 2012/ <dig> season. each cosegregated with the marker and phenotype .

the potential molecular marker was also tested against a set of cultivars with demonstrated present or undetectable γ-d. ‘radiance’, ‘albion’, ‘winter star’, and ‘sweet charlie’ were all γ-d positive and positive also for the pcr product . ‘deutsch evern’, ‘strawberry festival’, ‘lf9’, and ‘mieze schindler’ were all negative for γ-d and also negative also for the marker. ‘strawberry festival’ and ‘lf9’ were additionally interesting because ‘lf9’ is a seedling from self-pollination of ‘strawberry festival’  <cit> . the prediction would therefore be that ‘lf9’ would be negative for the marker and γ-d phenotype. this was confirmed by volatile and marker analysis.

ssr marker development
an ssr marker was developed to investigate cosegregation of alleles more distantly positioned relative to fafad <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the results of the ssr tested in the parents ‘elyana’ and ‘mara des bois’, and  <dig> progeny selected from both γ-d producers and non-producers. few progeny were tested because the objective of the ssr marker design was simply to demonstrate the potential for converting a gene candidate into a second type of molecular marker commonly used for fragaria genotyping. ‘elyana’ exhibited four marker alleles , and ‘mara des bois’ only possesses the  <dig> allele. for clarity, only the  <dig> and  <dig> alleles are shown. allele  <dig> was monomorphic in all genotypes tested, and alleles  <dig> and  <dig> were not associated with the γ-d phenotype. progeny  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were all positive the γ-d phenotype and for allele  <dig>  progeny  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were negative for γ-d and the  <dig> allele.

discussion
fruit flavor and aroma profiles are shaped by a mixture of sugars, acids and volatile organic compounds. individual volatile components have been demonstrated to play key roles in consumer liking, as noted in tomato  <cit> , and strawberry  <cit> . several reports have detailed the importance of key compounds to aroma production and the genetic loci or genes that control them  <cit> . one component contributing to flavor in strawberry fruits is γ-decalactone . this compound represents the recognized aromas in peaches and apricots, and is of interest to industry as a flavoring agent. the synthesis of γ-d is not well-understood in plants. however, several microorganisms can generate γ-d from fatty-acid substrates  <cit>  and are used as bioreactors to produce this flavor compound.

to identify transcripts related to γ-d production, two parents varying for the volatile were crossed. ‘elyana’ is a large, firm berry, and bred for production in florida  <cit> . ‘mara des bois’ is smaller and soft, and not used in wide commercial cultivation. fruits  were assayed for the volatile and also for transcripts associated with receptacle/achene ripening. the rnaseq data from producers and non-producers were computationally bulked to identify sequences common to each pool . strawberry fruit transcriptomes have been examined previously  <cit> , and show changes in a substantial number of transcripts throughout the ripening process. the commercial strawberry is octoploid and highly heterozygous  <cit> . crossing two plants produces a myriad of progeny phenotypes due to contributions from homoeologous genes. the segregation within subgenomes likely provides additional “noise” that allows for transcripts relevant to the trait to separate clearly from others, focusing the candidate set. transcriptomes for each plant were considered independently, so the transcriptomes of γ-d producers and non-producers could be compared in silico.

the test began with detection of γ-d. the γ-d producers show fluctuations in volatile quantity throughout the growing season . the genotypes with the highest concentrations were estimated to possess between  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm γ-d . gamma decalactone accumulation was not ever detected in the ‘mara des bois’ parent. the range of differences observed in parental fruits and progeny presented an ideal situation to assay global gene expression coinciding with volatile production.

when progeny were sorted by presence/absence of γ-d, a small subset of transcripts was significantly different between phenotypic groups. pairwise comparisons of rnaseq data around a fruit phenotype resolved to an especially strong single candidate, a transcript encoding an omega-6-fatty acid desaturase . this gene is located near a qtl previously reported to explain about 90% of the γ-d phenotype in strawberry  <cit> . another gene recently found in peach  was correlated with γ-d in ripening fruit, and demonstrated ω- <dig> oleate desaturase activity when overexpressed in yeast  <cit> . fatty acid desaturases catalyze the formation of double bonds into fatty acyl chains. the report from sanchez  <cit> , and the biochemistry inferred from protein sequence, each suggest a role for this gene in lactone production, but the precise biochemical steps have not been demonstrated. future work will examine the role of this transcript in transgenic lines.

fafad <dig> transcript abundance correlated well with the presence of γ-d. the transcript accumulated with ripening, and only in certain environmental conditions . the ability to produce γ-d segregated as a single dominant locus, consistent with previous reports  <cit> . a pcr-based survey of materials from the population indicated that the fafad <dig> genomic sequence could not be amplified from γ-d non-producers, suggesting gene deletion or radical alteration affecting pcr amplification. eight total combinations using ten distinctly positioned primers were used to amplify regions upstream of and within the fafad <dig> gene . in each case, ‘elyana’ genomic template amplified the expected fragments, but ‘mara des bois’ produced no amplicons. this is consistent with the idea that a deletion is responsible for the absence of fafad1-related sequence in the ‘mara des bois’ genome, and this would explain the dominant, single gene effect for the γ-d phenotype. this finding allowed for development of a pcr-based molecular marker to identify genotypes with the potential to produce γ-d. pcr primers corresponding to the 5′ sequence of fafad <dig> were used to amplify the region shown in figure  <dig> . the presence of the pcr product co-segregated precisely with the ability to produce the γ-d, in the parental cross, in progeny, and in backcross populations .

the nature of the deletion is further exemplified using simple sequence repeat  markers, tools frequently used to fingerprint strawberry germplasm  <cit> . the availability of the diploid strawberry, f. vesca, genome  <cit>  makes it possible to position the microsatellite sequences within the structural context of the strawberry genome. one ssr sequence is located 11 kb adjacent to the fafad <dig> gene, and polymorphisms would be predicted to segregate with the candidate gene. the results in figure  <dig> show that the presence of allele  <dig> is a reliable predictor of the ability to produce γ-d, at least in the subset of the population evaluated. these data are important because they provide two independent, pcr-based tests can differentiate γ-d producers and non-producers. while not tested outside of the parental genotypes and only in several progeny, this second primer set offers another potential molecular marker that may be used to verify results from the fafad <dig> sequence. the findings also indicate that the ssr is present in the ‘elyana’ parent and not the other, suggesting that the missing fafad <dig> gene may be part of a larger deletion.

the potential utility of this molecular marker was demonstrated when it was applied to a set of unrelated germplasm that was also varying for presence/absence of γ-d. in this case, the pcr product could only be amplified in genotypes demonstrated to produce γ-d. the evaluation was extended to wild germplasm where fruit could be obtained. even in these distant accessions, the pcr product was only amplified in lines where γ-d was detectable. the putative marker not only works within a population, but likely will work across commercial breeding populations and wild octoploid accessions. future studies will track the origin of the gene in diploid germplasm in an attempt to reconstruct its origins, as was done with alleles to trace linalool-producing variants of fanes <dig> <cit> .

there are notable limitations to the approach used in this study. the visual correlation between the γ-d phenotype and qrt-pcr results is shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  this quantitative trend, however, is not consistent in the rna-seq rpkm data . γ-d producers, irrespective of volatile amount produced, could not be distinguished quantitatively, though producers and non-producers were still easily discernible. this suggests that while the rna-seq approach worked well for the qualitative γ-d phenotype, uncovering quantitative γ-d effects would be very challenging. this further underscores the need to incorporate independent methods  for examining candidate genes in the early stages of discovery.

the development of two independent molecular markers that segregate with the phenotype in a wide range of germplam will permit improved parental selection and rapid screening of progeny possessing the ability to produce γ-d. a simple and robust assay can rapidly eliminate individual plants from breeding populations, saving time, fuel, space and other resources. most importantly, the marker allows more rapid integration of a fruity volatile into advanced selections.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study demonstrate that gene candidates for strawberry fruit traits may be identified by integrating careful phenotyping and transcriptomic analysis with genetics. this approach rapidly reduced the complexity of the octoploid transcriptome down to a single candidate gene. the identified gene, fafad <dig>  is functionally equivalent to genes involved in γ-d synthesis in fungi and potentially in peach  <cit> . gene identification led to the development of a gene-based marker, enabling selection for γ-d producers at the seedling stage. moving rapidly from candidate to marker has the potential to increase breeding efficiency and reduce the downstream costs associated with maintaining plants lacking a favorable trait. looking forward, γ-d is only one of many volatiles that can be analyzed with this approach. the same exact dataset may now be re-sorted to identify candidates for other volatiles. the bulk sorting of polyploid transcriptomes is a rapid and cost effective means to identify a testable suite of genes contributing to a given trait.
