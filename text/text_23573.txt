BACKGROUND
the conventional in-vitro assays to measure the titer or potency of live viral-based vaccines are usually based on the infectivity of the vaccine virus in cell cultures 
 <cit> . in both methods, the experiment duration is long due to the time needed for virus replication producing the biological effect. in addition, there is a cell substrate limitation with the traditional methods, and only viruses that cause a detectable biological effect on infected cells can be evaluated.

the introduction of real time pcr technology for the quantitation of viral infectivity has significantly improved viral infectivity assays. this method is a combination of virus propagation and quantitative pcr  or rt-qpcr. in a study by ranheim et al.,
 <cit>  a rt-qpcr assay was developed to detect rotavirus vaccine  infectivity within two days. in this assay, the confluent vero cells in 96-well plates were inoculated with serial dilutions of test samples, a pentavalent reassortant rotavirus reference standard, and assay controls. after 24 hours, vero cells were lysed and the lysates were measured by rt-qpcr to quantify viral replication. in another study, schalk et al.,
 <cit>  developed a rapid assay for the measurement of infectivity-potency in mmr trivalent vaccines based on a qpcr infectivity assay. the assay was able to demonstrate the potency of mumps and measles viruses within a period of 2 days. since rubella virus replicates slower than measles and mumps, the potency estimation for rubella virus was pcr-based assays as end-points since a plaque assay for measles and rubella virus usually takes 9 days
 <cit> . this period of time for detection of mumps virus in cell line is 6 days. a one week time reduction in the qpcr infectivity assay without loss of precision compared to a plaque assay and tcid <dig> was a major advantage of the assay.

dr. knipe’s group at harvard medical school constructed a candidate herpes virus vaccine through deletion of the ul <dig> and ul <dig> coding regions of hsv- <dig> virus
 <cit> . the resultant vaccine, hsv <dig>  is being developed by sanofi pasteur and is currently under a human phase i clinical trial
 <cit> . the av529- <dig> cell line is used for the propagation of hsv <dig>  this cell line is a vero-based cell line specifically engineered to express the hsv- <dig> ul <dig> and ul <dig> transgenes. with expression of the hsv- <dig> ul <dig> and ul <dig> genes, av529- <dig> is able to support replication of hsv529
 <cit> . herein, we have developed a high throughput rt-qpcr-based approach for evaluation of the infectious titer of hsv <dig> candidate vaccine. the developed infectivity rt-qpcr based approach determines relative quantification to an appropriately constructed in-house reference control. the assay’s accuracy and intermediate precision was also investigated to ensure suitable performance of this analytical method. furthermore, a concordance stability study between the developed method and a classical plaque assay was performed to investigate the correlation between both assays. the results obtained from both assays using the same identical sample set demonstrated a suitable linear correlation between both approaches. in summary, the developed rt-qpcr infectivity assay is a rapid method with high-throughput capacity that can be applied to quantify the infectious titer of hsv <dig> candidate vaccine. this approach could also be applied to other live or attenuated viral vaccines to quantify the infectious titer of product.

RESULTS
specificity of hsv- <dig> various target genes and optimization of harvest time
the accumulation of hsv <dig> rna during infection was measured by one step rt-qpcr at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 24 hours post-infection using specific primers for icp <dig>  tk, and gd <dig>  a sufficient quantity of rna from cells infected with hsv <dig> was extracted by adding 50 μl of each hsv <dig> dilution to each well in a 96-well plate format. the cells were lysed, rna was purified, dnase treated, and one-step rt-qpcr was performed. after rt-qpcr, c
t
 values of each targeted gene were plotted versus time post infection. no trends were observed for plots of c
t
 versus hsv <dig> concentration for studies targeting icp <dig> or tk genes 3–24 hours post-infection . however, one-step rt-qpcr using gd <dig> primers showed a linear relationship between the logarithm of the viral concentration and the c
t
 values 12–16 hr post-infection. the slope of the graph flattens, and no trends were observed 24 hours post-infection as replication of hsv <dig> virus, causes death of av529- <dig> cells over time. the accumulation of hsv <dig> viral concentration during infection at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 24 hours post-infection using specific gd <dig> primers is shown in figure 
1a. the overall results show that hsv- <dig> gd <dig> is a suitable targeted gene for evaluation of hsv <dig> infectious titre 12–16 hour post-infection.

evaluate the infectivity of hsv <dig> test samples by targeting hsv- <dig> gd <dig> gene
the assay targeting gd <dig> was performed six times in a 96-well plate format and the results were analyzed through extrapolation or pla software  <dig> . briefly, 96-well plates were seeded with av529- <dig> a day before infection. next day, cells were infected with the serial dilutions of hsv <dig> . the same lot of hsv <dig> was used as both test sample and in-house reference control in all six independent assays. rna was extracted 16 hours post infection, treated with dnase, rt-qpcr performed targeting hsv- <dig> gd <dig>  and infectious titer assigned by pla analysis. since the same hsv <dig> lot was used as the test sample and the in-house reference control, it was expected to observe two close parallel lines  after pla analysis. the infectious titer ratio, 95% confidence interval, and relative confidence interval observed for the six independent assays are shown in figure

a comparative stability study between rt-qpcr infectivity assay and a classical plaque assay
to determine if rt-qpcr infectivity assay is a suitable approach to evaluate the stability of hsv <dig> test samples, a concordance study between the rt-qpcr infectivity assay and a plaque assay was conducted using identical test samples set in both assays. hsv <dig> test samples were incubated at 4–8°c or 22–25°c in various time points and the infectious titre was measured by a classical plaque assay. these samples set were also tested by the rt-qpcr infectivity assay and the results were analyzed by extrapolation or pla. a suitable correlation was observed between pla or extrapolation analysis . a suitable correlation was also determined between the infectious titer as measured by rt-qpcr infectivity assay or plaque assay .

hsv <dig> test samples were incubated at a. 4–8°c or b. 22-25°c at various time points and the infectious titre was measured by rt-qpcr infectivity assay or plaque assay.

evaluation of intermediate precision and accuracy in the developed rt-qpcr infectivity assay
to evaluate the intra-laboratory variation and closeness of data, the intermediate precision and accuracy of the developed rt-qpcr infectivity assay was assessed. for this purpose, the hsv <dig> in-house reference control was used as both test sample and in-house reference control. as described, av529- <dig> cells were infected and the total rna was extracted and processed 16 hours post-infection. rt-qpcr was performed targeting gd <dig> gene, and the results were analyzed through pla software version  <dig> . the assay was performed six times by two analysts on different days over a period of two months. the coefficient of variation  from the six independent assays was  <dig> %. the accuracy of the assay was calculated by evaluating the percentages of values obtained by rt-qpcr infectivity assay versus the expected infectious titre values by plaque assay . the accuracy of assay was evaluated in the range of  <dig> % to  <dig> % .

rt-qpcr infectivity assay was performed six times by two analysts on different days. the accuracy of the assay was calculated by evaluating the percentages of values obtained by rt-qpcr infectivity assay versus the expected infectious titre values by plaque assay. the cv% from the six independent assays is also determined.

discussion
there are several challenges with conventional in-vitro assays  to measure the titer of live attenuated or defective viral-based vaccines
 <cit> . the traditional assays are usually laborious and sometimes hard to interpret. the time due to-assay-completion and cell substrate limitations are also challenges with the conventional in-vitro assays. for instance, it takes nine days to measure the infectious titre in measles or rubella vaccines
 <cit> . furthermore, traditional methods require virus neutralization for characterization of infectivity or potentially potency in multivalent viral vaccines. however, a pcr-infectivity based approach does not require virus neutralization, making it a more attractive alternative for multivalent viral vaccines. although hsv <dig> candidate vaccine has not been faced with some of these challenges , a rt-qpcr infectivity based-approach was developed to enhance the assay’s throughput .

during hsv- <dig> replication, the five viral genes expressed in the immediate-early , encode regulatory proteins
 <cit> . after the immediate-early step, early genes are activated , and these encode proteins required for replication of the viral genome. after genome replication in the early phase, the late step  occurs, where hsv- <dig> structural proteins are expressed and the virus is formed
 <cit> . one of the critical features of the rt-qpcr infectivity assay was to determine the specificity of the assay targeting appropriate hsv- <dig> gene. therefore, one gene  from each of the replication phases was targeted. we were able to observe a linear relationship between the logarithm of the hsv <dig> concentration and the c
t
 values by targeting the gd <dig> gene and not the icp <dig> or tk genes. it has to be noted that during the late gd <dig> expression, the immediate-early and early proteins are also generated and the full form of the virus is completed. hsv- <dig> gd <dig> rna accumulation starts to level off approximately 12 hours post-infection and remains relatively steady for up to 16 hour post-infection.

the developed assay is a combination of in-vitro hsv <dig> propagation in the suitable cell line for a short hsv- <dig> replication cycle followed by a rt-qpcr. the infectious titers of the test samples are estimated relative to an in-house reference control. this in-house reference control was titrated in the lab using conventional plaque assay and validated based on  <dig> independent assays accordance to the international conference on harmonisation  guideline
 <cit> . therefore, the assay measures the relative infectious unit based on the in-house reference control unitage. briefly, confluent av <dig> cells in 96-well plates were inoculated with serial dilutions of hsv <dig> test samples and an hsv <dig> in-house control, to produce a standard curve followed by incubation for 16 hours. thereafter, hsv529- <dig> cells were lysed, total rna purified, dnase treated, and rt-qpcr targeting hsv- <dig> gd <dig> gene was performed to quantitate hsv <dig> nucleic acid produced during replication. the relative infectious titre for each sample was determined using the parallel-line analysis as described in the european pharmacopoeia  <dig> 
 <cit> . the analysis by extrapolation is not an appropriate approach as several parameters including the similar conditions between the in-house reference control and test samples are not considered during analysis. in this study, the correlation between test samples and the in-house reference control was assessed using pla software version  <dig> . before pla analysis, all c
t
 values for the in-house reference control and test samples were subjected to standard outlier analysis, with the limit that no more than one data point  per hsv <dig> dilution could be removed. afterwards, each assay was analyzed by pla software. the assay was considered valid if the regression, linearity, and parallelism were significant.

to investigate if rt-qpcr infectivity assay is a suitable method to evaluate the stability of hsv <dig> test samples, a concordance study was conducted between the rt-qpcr infectivity assay and a conventional infectivity plaque assay using identical test samples. while the results illustrated a suitable correlation  between the qrt-pcr infectivity assay and the plaque assay, higher cost and complexity of rt-qpcr infectivity assay were two drawbacks of this method compare to a traditional method.

to evaluate the closeness of the analytically determined hsv <dig> infectious titre values, the accuracy of the method was evaluated in six independent assays by two analysts on different days. the accuracy was determined as the percentage of the infectious titre values obtained by rt-qpcr versus infectious titre values by a plaque assay. the accuracy was evaluated in the range of  <dig> % to  <dig> %, indicating a suitable accuracy for the assay. the intermediate precision of the assay was also evaluated to measure the variation of the obtained data. to evaluate this parameter, the assay was performed six times by two different operators over a time period of 2 months. the mean value of this run control was  <dig>  log pfu/ml with a standard deviation of  <dig> , resulting in a coefficient of variation of  <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a rt-qpcr based approach was utilized to specifically detect and quantitate the hsv <dig> rna after productive infection in av529- <dig> cells. the results show that the developed rt-qpcr infectivity assay is a reproducible approach that can quantitate the hsv <dig> infectious titre before the plaque assay formation is visible on day  <dig>  the described rt-qpcr infectivity approach might also be a suitable approach for determination of potency of test samples, however; further evaluation of sub-potent lots and/or assessing clinical data is required.
