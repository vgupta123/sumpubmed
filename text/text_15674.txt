BACKGROUND
the study of evolutionary processes of host specialization by parasites is of special importance for evolutionary biologists because it causes speciation events in parasites, and, therefore, it is one of the main examples of ecological conditions driving adaptive radiation of parasitic groups on their hosts  <cit> . in general, among suitable hosts, the degree of host specificity of parasites can be seen as an equilibrium between two opposing evolutionary forces that describe the trade-off in the ability to optimally parasitize different hosts:  to use the maximum number of hosts encountered; and  to make best use of the most frequently encountered hosts  <cit> . however, as the number of potential host species increases, the probability that a specialist parasite can locate a suitable host decreases, reducing the advantages gained through specialization. in these cases, generalist parasites would experience greater fitness advantages and specialization would no longer be adaptive  <cit> . thus, when trade-offs for exploiting different hosts exist, relative host abundance is the key to host specificity  <cit> . given sufficient abundance of target host, the benefits of specialization, which increase the parasite's efficiency in acquiring resources from the most abundant host, outweigh the disadvantages of interacting less well with other non-specific potential hosts  <cit> . on the other hand, generalist parasites would thrive in heterogeneous communities, as it allows a parasite to reproduce successfully in many of the encountered potential hosts. in other words, predictability of resources  would be a key factor explaining probability of host specialization  <cit> . if host populations are unpredictable and ephemeral, generalist parasites are more likely to occur  <cit> .

demographic parameters of both host and parasites including host abundance and distribution at a large geographic scale  are known to be key factors explaining host-specialization by parasites  <cit> . many parasites show common patterns of host specificity, with higher host specificity where host abundance is high and reliable  <cit> . in accordance with this pattern, in several unrelated parasitic taxa, greater host specificity has been detected in temperate, but not in tropical, regions where the community of potential hosts is less diverse and species are more abundant . in addition, in a study involving five trophic levels , a high degree of specialization was detected at the lower trophic levels correlating with a greater relative abundance of host species  <cit> . thus, demographic characteristics  of potential hosts were in fact shown to predict the evolution of specialized races or species of parasites  <cit> .

here we explore this hypothesis in the european cuckoo, a generalist brood parasite with host races specializing in parasitizing particular host species  <cit> . as any interspecific brood parasite, the european cuckoo lays its eggs in the nests of other bird species, the hosts that incubate and raise parasitic offspring. because cuckoos often impose severe fitness costs on parasitized hosts, recognition and rejection of parasite eggs is of selective advantage for hosts. on the other hand, mimicry of parasitic egg to those of their hosts is advantageous for cuckoos because it reduces the probability of hosts recognizing and rejecting parasitic eggs. however, because egg appearance of different cuckoo host species may drastically differ, and a cuckoo female lay eggs of a specific colour pattern  <cit> , but cannot change the appearance of their eggs depending on the parasitized host species, the advantage of egg mimicry when parasitizing hosts with similar eggs became disadvantageous when parasitizing other suitable hosts. consequently, the evolution of different cuckoo egg morphs that mimic eggs of their hosts reflects specialization occurring in some, but not all suitable host species  <cit> . in accordance with the hypothesis of demographic characteristics of hosts affecting the resolution of the trade-off for the ability to adapt optimally to different hosts , we predicted that specific egg-morphs of european cuckoos should have evolved in hosts that are evenly distributed at high density in their european range.

to test this prediction suitable host species or genera were classified as having or not having specialized egg morphs  following moksnes and r√∏skaft  <cit> . we collected information on population density of suitable host species for  <dig> european geographic regions of similar area . as an index of heterogeneity in population density, we estimated the coefficient of variation  in density among these twelve european regions as an index of spatial distribution widely used in ecology for characterizing uniformly , randomly  or contagiously  distributed species .

RESULTS
as expected from the hypothesis of parasite specialization being more common in abundant and evenly distributed hosts, we found that european cuckoos have evolved host-specific egg morphs for host species with higher population density and lower coefficients of variation in population density in different regions. that was the case independent of whether the analyses were based on species-specific data or phylogenetically independent contrasts . these relationships were independent of the allometric effects of body mass because the inclusion of phylogenetic independent contrasts of body mass in a multiple regression through the origin did not explain the probability of evolution of specialized cuckoo-egg morphs  =  <dig>  , t <dig> =  <dig> , p >  <dig> ); with cv of population density as a second independent variable: beta  =  <dig>  , t <dig> =  <dig> , p >  <dig> ), and it did not affect the percentage of variance explained by population density  =  <dig>  , t <dig> =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) or by coefficient of variation in population density  = - <dig>  , t <dig> =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). furthermore, the addition of duration of the nestling period

when analyzing the relationship between the existence of cuckoo egg-morphs and population density and cv at the genus level, we found similar results. populations of genera for which specialized cuckoo egg morphs had been described, either at the level of species or genus, were more dense and less heterogeneously distributed in europe than populations of genera for which a cuckoo egg-morph had been described . furthermore, the evolution of specialized cuckoo-egg morphs was more common in genera that held a large number of suitable host species :  <dig>   vs  <dig>  , t-test of log10-transformed data: t =  <dig> , df =  <dig>  p =  <dig> ), even after controlling for phylogenetic effects  =  <dig>  , t =  <dig> , corrected df =  <dig>  p =  <dig> ). the genera holding the largest number of species were also those with the most dense  =  <dig>  , t =  <dig> , df =  <dig>  p =  <dig> ; using phylogenetic independent contrasts; beta  =  <dig>  , t =  <dig> , corrected df =  <dig>  p =  <dig> ) and evenly distributed populations  = - <dig>  , t =  <dig> , df =  <dig>  p =  <dig> ; using phylogenetic independent contrasts; beta  = - <dig>  , t =  <dig> , corrected df =  <dig>  p <  <dig> ).

discussion
we found evidence suggesting that cuckoo gentes have evolved more often in abundant suitable host species that are evenly distributed across the european continent. the interpretation of these results in a coevolutionary scenario of specialization largely depends on evidence supporting a genetic basis of cuckoo gentes on the one hand, and the appropriateness of our estimates of host density and heterogeneity in distribution on the other. below we discuss these assumptions related to our estimates and the importance of our results for evolutionary scenarios of parasites specializing on suitable hosts.

host density at the european continental range was estimated for twelve different regions, mostly including more than one country, while heterogeneity in distribution of suitable hosts was estimated as the coefficient of variation in population density in these twelve european regions. these regions were of similar size and comprised most of the european continent. the continental geographic scale used here has the advantage of producing general estimations largely independent of local variation at geographic local scales that do not capture general patterns in distribution of species. however, the level of heterogeneity in estimated population densities would most likely increase as the geographic scale decreases because heterogeneity in variables explaining species distribution  also increases  <cit> . therefore, if variation in habitat availability across geographic ranges is linked to variation in habitat selection of different host species, the geographic scale from which population density and level of heterogeneity in population density was estimated will be critical. a problem of non-stationary in our estimations would mainly affect estimates for patchily distributed species such as warblers associated with particular habitats  where they live at a high density. we explicitly attempted to quantify this potential problem in our estimations, and following recommendations by osborne & suarez-seoane  <cit>  we calculated density and coefficient of variation in density for more reduced geographic areas within the same european regions. we found that dividing regions into geographic sub-samples did not produce estimates that differed significantly from the original estimates . therefore, we found no evidence of problems related to spatial non-stationary estimates in our estimates of population density and heterogeneity in distribution  <cit> .

the formation of parasite races involves genetic changes that are part of adaptations to improve exploitation of a particular host or environment. size and colour patterns of eggs have a strong genetic component  <cit>  and vary greatly among host species . furthermore, strong evidence suggests that specific egg morphs with genes coding for egg colour patterns are maternally inherited and most likely located on the female-specific w-chromosome  <cit> . thus, egg-morphs of cuckoos that mimic eggs of a single or few closely related host species provide evidence for such specialization and race formation in the european cuckoo  <cit> . here we used the ten cuckoo egg morphs  assigned to a single host species by moksnes & r√∏skaft  <cit>  in a study of egg collection at museums. because the very large sample size and broad geographic range used in that study, these cuckoo egg-morphs is considered as evidence of host race evolution by cuckoos across europe  <cit> .

specialization could occur for hosts that the parasites will easily find  <cit> . consequently, we predicted that cuckoo-egg morphs should have evolved for abundant host species  <cit> . in accordance, we found that cuckoo-egg morphs have more frequently evolved in species of higher average population density . these results were not due to the use of species-specific cuckoo-egg morphs exclusively because, when also including egg morphs associated with entire genera, population density of genera explained the probability of having specialized cuckoo egg morphs .

host density is a central species-specific trait explaining specialization and speciation of parasites because it affects probability of parasites locating preferred hosts. specialization of parasites exploiting particular hosts invariably provokes disadvantages when parasitizing other hosts, and, consequently, the evolution of specialization can be seen as a compromise between the use of the maximum number of suitable hosts, and the use of the most frequent suitable host encountered  <cit> . furthermore, for similar abundance of different suitable hosts, as the number of species increases, the probability of parasite specializing on a particular suitable host decreases. consequently, relative host abundance is key to explaining host selection and host specificity of parasites . although host abundance or related variables, sometimes failed to explain host specificity , our results are consistent with the hypothesis.

another demographic trait that could affect host specialization by parasites is the consistency in host abundance at different locations because, as density, it also affects the probability of parasites locating a host species and, therefore, the trade-off in the ability to optimally parasitize different hosts  <cit> . in agreement with this demographic trait being important for cuckoos, comparative evidence suggests that geographic range of potential hosts explains host selection by the european cuckoo in britain  <cit> . therefore, specialization and race  formation of cuckoos might have occurred in evenly distributed hosts . again, our results were consistent with the prediction . these results were independent of the potential allometric effects of body size and nestling period for both host selection and demographic characteristics because the inclusion of these variables in our statistical model did not change the conclusions .

the hypothesis of specialization on the most predictable  host resource was first introduced by ward  <cit> . in a host-parasite system, large body size, long-lived or abundant hosts are considered the most predictable resources for parasites because living on a more predictable host may increase parasite fecundity and survival  <cit> . because host adaptation might promote race formation and speciation by reducing gene flow  <cit> , those evolutionary processes should more commonly occur in parasites that exploit the most predictable and abundant hosts  <cit> . in accordance with this line of reasoning, host specificity is more common in hosts that live longer   <cit> . however, as far as we know, empirical evidence for the importance of heterogeneity in the distribution of hosts on parasite specialization does not exist in the literature, and, therefore, our results are the first to support this hypothetical relationship.

the scarcity of evidence supporting the importance of host density and distribution as variables related to predictability of resources  for parasites could be due to the parasite-host model systems being used in previous studies. most of these studies were performed on internal parasites of fishes and flies  for which host body size is a variable that reflects predictability of resources for parasites. evidence for the importance of host density explaining specialization by parasites came mainly from plant-phytophagous insect systems  where apart from size of hosts, host density per se is an important variable reflecting predictability of resources for adults or larvae. for cuckoos, abundance and distribution of suitable hosts are variables that closely reflect predictability of suitable host species , which, as predicted by norton and carpenter  <cit> , explains the association between these variables and probability of race formation in the european cuckoo. thus, the association between patterns of geographic distribution of hosts  and evolutionary processes associated with specialization of parasites  should be predicted only in the case when population density and heterogeneity of distribution of hosts represent resource availability for parasites as in the case of brood parasites.

we have found an association between probability of specialized egg morph evolution and number of suitable host species within a genus. although this result could suggest a possible role of cuckoos in the diversification of host genera, as in other parasite-host systems  <cit> , it is more likely that the specialization of cuckoos on diversified host genera including abundant and homogeneously distributed species is of selective advantage. closely related bird species tend to lay similar eggs  <cit> . moreover, host ability to recognize foreign eggs depends on degree of mimicry between host and parasitic egg , and, thus, when egg-recognition ability improves in one but not in other host species within a given genus, cuckoo egg-morphs might still have success parasitizing some species in the genus.

CONCLUSIONS
we have presented evidence suggesting that population density and homogeneity of geographic distribution of hosts explain the evolution of specialized egg-morphs of the european cuckoo. these results are consistent with the hypothesis that resource  predictability explains the evolution of host races and species in parasites.
