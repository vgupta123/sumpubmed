BACKGROUND
approximately  <dig>  mite and tick species   <cit>  have been described to this day. since the number of undescribed species is thought to be twenty-fold higher, this subclass is by far the most species-rich group among the arachnida  <cit> . acari diversified  <dig> million years ago and currently three major lineages are recognised: opilioacariformes, acariformes and parasitiformes  <cit> . the acariformes comprise two major groups, the trombidiformes and sarcoptiformes  <cit> . two of the most prominent members of the sarcoptiformes are the european house dust mite dermatophagoides pteronyssinus  and the american house dust mite dermatophagoides farinae , both belonging to the family of the pyroglyphidae . pyroglyphid mites are typical inhabitants of animal nests. in the human environment, they are mainly found in upholstery, textile floor covers and beddings, where they primarily feed on the skin scale fraction in house dust  <cit> . about  <dig> years ago, house dust mites were first recognized as one of the major sources of allergens in house dust  <cit> . the allergenic proteins are found in high concentrations in mite faeces, which, after drying and pulverizing, become airborne and can be inhaled. the presence of these allergens in sensitive persons is able to cause diseases like asthma, dermatitis and rhinitis  <cit> . in countries with a temperate climate,  <dig> to  <dig> per cent of the population is sensitive to house dust mite-derived allergens  <cit> .

complete mitochondrial  genome sequences are becoming increasingly important for effective evolutionary and population studies. mt genome sequences are not only more informative than shorter sequences of individual genes, they also provide sets of genome-level characters, such as the relative position of different genes, rna secondary structures and modes of control of replication and transcription  <cit> . however, the applicability of mt genomes as a marker of highly divergent lineages is still controversial  <cit>  and remains to be elucidated  <cit> . in addition, unravelling mt genomes can be of economic importance as well, since several chemical classes of pesticides target mt proteins. well-known acaricides like acequinocyl and fluacrypyrim affect mt electron transport through the inhibition of the mt encoded cytochrome b in complex iii  <cit> . also, the economically important class of meti -acaricides target the mt complex i, although their exact molecular target has not yet been elucidated. recently, resistance to the acaricide bifenazate was shown to be caused by mutations in the mt encoded cytochrome b and to have evolved rapidly through a short stage of mt heteroplasmy  <cit> .

at present, the mt genomes of  <dig> species belonging to the acari are available at ncbi . most of the submitted sequences have the typical features of metazoan mt genomes. they are circular, between  <dig> and  <dig> kb in length, contain a coding region with  <dig> genes  and a relatively small non-coding region. the latter is mostly at-rich and fulfils a role in the initiation of replication and transcription  <cit> . compared to this typical configuration, the mt genomes of steganacarus magnus, metaseiulus occidentalis and leptotrombidium pallidum show some abnormal features. s. magnus lacks  <dig> of the  <dig> trnas normally present in mt genomes  <cit> . m. occidentalis has a unusually large mt genome  resulting from a duplication event of a large fragment of the codon region. despite its large size, genes coding for nad <dig> and nad <dig> were not found during the initial annotation process  <cit> . l. pallidum on the other hand has  <dig> mt genes due to a duplication of the 16s-rrna  <cit> .

in this study, we analyse the complete mt genome of a member of the sarcoptiformes, the european house dust mite d. pteronyssinus, after obtaining the complete sequence using a long pcr approach.

RESULTS
genome organisation
the mt genome of d. pteronyssinus was amplified, using long pcr, in three overlapping fragments. the final assembled sequence was  <dig>  bp , making it the fifth smallest sequenced genome within the acari. only the mt genomes of tetranychus urticae , leptotrombidium akamushi , leptotrombidium deliense  and s. magnus  are smaller . as non-specific amplification artefacts and incomplete coverage of genes are well-known drawbacks of a pcr approach  <cit> , we checked the genome size by restriction digest on rolling circle amplified mtdna . this approach confirmed the sequence size, considering that the relative mobility of mtdna restriction fragments can show slight  deviations compared to their sequence length  <cit> . the mt genome of d. pteronyssinus is the first mt sequence of a mite belonging to the astigmata and is together with the mt genome of s. magnus the only representative from the order of the sarcoptiformes. adding this genome to the database resulted in  <dig> publicly available acari mtdna sequences. twelve belong to species in the superorder of the parasitiformes whereas nine – among which d. pteronyssinus – belong to species in the superorder of the acariformes.

all  <dig> genes present in a standard metazoan mt genome could be identified . gene overlap exists between trnd/atp <dig> , trnr/nad <dig> , trnm/trns <dig> , trnp/trnv , trnv/trnk , trnw/trny , trny/nad <dig> , trni/trnq  and trnl1/trnc . no overlap was found between protein coding genes. small non-coding regions  are present between trns2/trna , trna/trnp  and nad1/nad <dig> . a large non-coding region is positioned between trnf and trns <dig> . twenty-five genes of the mt genome of d. pteronyssinus are transcribed on the majority strand , whereas the others are oriented on the minority strand .

the mt genome of the horseshoe crab limulus polyphemus is considered to represent the ground pattern for arthropod mt genomes  <cit> . comparing the d. pteronyssinus genome to this sequence revealed that only  <dig> of the  <dig> gene boundaries in l. polyphemus are conserved in d. pteronyssinus . moreover, by making use of the pattern search function in the mitome-database , the mt gene order of d. pteronyssinus appeared to be unique among arthropods. remarkably, the relative position of trnl <dig> , which differentiates the chelicerata, myriapoda and onychophora from the insecta and crustacea according to boore  <cit> , is not conserved. however, boore's hypothesis was based on mt genome data from only  <dig> chelicerata that were available in  <dig>  at present,  <dig> complete chelicerate mt genomes are available in the ncbi-database . out of these, only  <dig> depict the specific arrangement of trnl <dig> between nad <dig> and 16s-rrna . this illustrates that care should be taken when general rules are deduced from limited datasets.

mt gene arrangements have already provided strong support toward the resolution of several long-standing controversial phylogenetic relationships  <cit> . surprisingly, the mt gene order of d. pteronyssinus differs considerably from that of other mites . comparing the d. pteronyssinus mt genome to the mt sequence of the oribatid s. magnus  <cit> , the closest relative of d. pteronyssinus, revealed that only  <dig> of the  <dig> gene boundaries in s. magnus are conserved in d. pteronyssinus .

extending this analysis to the other acari mt genomes showed that in several cases the set of neighboured genes that were not separated during the evolution  <cit>  was greater between members of different superorders  and rhipicephalus sanguineus ) than between members of the same superorder  and t. urticae ) . exclusion of trnas in our analysis showed a similar trend, suggesting that protein coding genes were also involved in mt gene rearrangements. these results indicate that mt gene orders seem less useful for deduction of phylogenetic relationships between superorders within the acari. however, comparing gene order might be more powerful to establish phylogenetic relations within families, as was previously proposed  <cit> . in the case of the ixodidae family, it was shown that the division of prostriata  and metastriata  could be linked to mt gene arrangements  <cit> .

base composition and codon usage
the overall at-content of the mt genome of d. pteronyssinus is  <dig> % . this is within the range of the average at-content of acari mt genomes . the high at-content is reflected in the codon usage  with nucleotides 'a' and 't' preferred over 'c' and 'g' on the wobble position and the predominant use of codons deficient in 'c' or 'g'. for example, the most frequently used codons are ttt   and tta  .

* rscu is the number of times a particular codon is observed relative to the number of times a codon would be observed in the absence of any codon usage bias  <cit> .

metazoan mt genomes usually present a clear strand bias in nucleotide composition  <cit> . this is probably due to asymmetric patterns of mutations during transcription and replication when one strand remains transiently in a single-stranded state, making it more vulnerable to dna damage  <cit> . however, in the case of mtdna-replication, this hypothesis is not without controversy  <cit> . the strand bias in nucleotide composition can be measured as gc- and at-skews / and /, respectively)  <cit> . the overall gc- and at-skews of the j-strand of the d. pteronyssinus mt genome are  <dig>  and - <dig> , respectively. these are the most extreme values encountered within mite mt genomes up till now  and they are reversed compared to the usual strand biases of metazoan mtdna . moreover, a positive gc-skew for mite mt genomes seems to be rare since at present, it was only encountered in varroa destructor. although hypothetical, it could be the result of a strand swap of the control region  <cit> . this region contains all initiation sites for transcription  <cit>  and an inversion of the control region is expected to produce a global reversal of asymmetric mutational constraints in the mtdna, resulting with time in a complete reversal of strand compositional bias  <cit> . the asymmetrical directional mutation pressure is also reflected in the codon usage of genes oriented in opposite directions  <cit> . whereas nng and nnu codons are preferred over nna and nnc codons on the j-strand, genes on the n-strand show the exact opposite trend  comparison of frequencies of codons ending with the same nucleotide).

protein coding genes
nine proteins are encoded by genes on the j-strand , while four are encoded by genes on the n-strand . the total length  and at-content  of the protein-coding genes are within the range of values typical for acari  . compared to other mite mt proteins, cox <dig>  cox <dig> and cytb are best conserved. on the other hand, atp <dig>  nad <dig> and nad4l showed lowest similarity values .

start and stop codons were determined based on alignments with the corresponding genes and proteins of other mite species. in the case of stop codons, we could also benefit from available expressed sequence tags  of d. pteronyssinus  and d. farinae    <cit> . as for other metazoan mt proteins, unorthodox initiation codons are used  <cit>  . eight genes  use the standard atg start codon,  <dig> genes  start with ata and nad <dig> initiates with att. atp <dig> most likely starts with codon ttg.

eleven genes employ a complete translation termination codon, either tag  or taa . with the exception of nad <dig>  atp <dig> and nad4l, d. pteronyssinus ests for all these genes confirmed the position of the stop codon . berthier et al.  <cit>  showed that the adjacent genes, nad4l/nad <dig> and atp8/atp <dig>  were transcribed and translated as a bicistronic mrna in the model organism drosophila melanogaster. however, as no ests were found that aligned with the nad4l/nad <dig> and atp8/atp <dig> gene boundaries, it could not be confirmed whether this was also the case for d. pteronyssinus. despite its efficiency, the use of sequence alignments to determine the position of stop codons resulted in several cases in overlapping genes. for example, based on a highly conserved tryptophan at the c-terminal end of acari nad <dig> proteins, a stop codon was positioned despite the resulting  <dig> bp overlap with trnar. the two remaining genes  are likely equipped with a truncated stop codon . polyadenylation of the mrna is needed in these cases to form a fully functional taa stop codon  <cit> . although speculative, ests of d. farinae confirm the truncated stop of nad <dig> .

transfer rnas
fourteen trnas are encoded on the j-strand and  <dig> on the n-strand . secondary structures were predicted for all trnas . with the exception of trns <dig>  and trnp , all anticodon sequences were identical to those of l. pallidum and s. magnus, the only acariform mites for which trna secondary structures have been reported  <cit> . usually, t is in the first anticodon position for trnas that recognise either four-fold degenerate codon families or nnr codons. g is usually in this position only to specifically recognize nny-codons  <cit> . except for trnm, all of the d. pteronyssinus mt trnas follow this pattern. trnm has the anticodon cat , which is the case for almost all animal mt systems  <cit>  .

only one trna lacks the d-arm: trns <dig>  as is common for most metazoans. with the exception of trnc, trnv and trns <dig>  all trnas have t-arm variable loops  instead of the t-arm. similar structures were found for trnas of l. pallidum  <cit>  and s. magnus  <cit> . the absence of the t-arm is a typical feature for trnas of chelicerata belonging to the orders of the araneae, scorpiones and thelyphonida. however, other taxa within the chelicerata  possess typical metazoan cloverleaf trnas  <cit> . masta and boore  <cit>  suggested a multi-step evolutionary process in an attempt to understand how so many trnas in these chelicerate groups could lose their t-arm. according to this speculative theory, changes in mt ribosomes, resulting in the fact that the loss of arms from trnas was tolerated  <cit> , and/or changes in specific elongation factors  <cit>  are considered as a first step in this process.

only  <dig> of the  <dig> trnas have a completely matched  <dig> bp acceptor stem . a maximum of  <dig> mismatches in this stem is found in trnr. in contrast, almost all trnas  possess a completely matched  <dig> bp anticodon stem. trnc, trns <dig> and trnn have a single mismatch whereas trny has two mismatches in this stem. all trnas, except trnl <dig>  have a symmetric anticodon loop consisting of  <dig> bp up- and  <dig> bp downstream of the  <dig> bp anticodon. the anticodon loop of trnl <dig> consists of  <dig> nucleotides preceding the anticodon and  <dig> nucleotides immediately following it. this kind of aberrant anticodon loops have also been reported for the two-humped camel camelus bactrianus ferus   <cit>  and the scorpion mesobuthus gibbosus   <cit> . as mentioned before, sequences of some trnas overlap with neighbouring genes. the extreme examples are trnr, trns <dig> and trnv. trnr overlaps with the adjacent gene nad <dig> on the same strand for  <dig> bp at its 3'-end whereas trns <dig> overlaps with the adjacent gene trnm on the same strand for  <dig> bp at its 3'-end. trnv overlaps with the adjacent gene trnp on the opposite strand for  <dig> bp at its 3'-end and with trnk on the opposite strand for  <dig> bp at its 5'-start. despite these overlaps, we consider these genes not likely to be pseudogenes. first of all, their sequence is relatively well conserved when compared to corresponding genes of other acari. secondly, besides sequence conservation they depict a conserved secondary structure. thirdly, an est  of the related species d. farinae was found corresponding to the region covering trnr, trnm and trns <dig> of d. pteronyssinus indicating that the genes are expressed . finally, and most importantly, stem mismatches and sequence overlap are not uncommon for mt trnas of arachnids  <cit> , and are probably repaired by a post-transcriptional editing process  <cit> .

non-coding regions
the largest non-coding region  is flanked by trnf and trns <dig>  it is highly enriched in at  and can form stable stem-loop secondary structures. based on these features, it possibly functions as a control region  <cit> . with the exception of t. urticae , it has the highest at-content of all acari mt control regions . the position of the non-coding region differs from most insect and arachnid mt genomes, where the region is mostly located in close proximity to 12s-rrna .

based on the sequence pattern, the control region can be subdivided in a repeat region and a stem-loop region. the first region  contains several at-repeats. in order to verify the exact number of repeats we resequenced this region. for this purpose, two flanking primers, dp-ms-f and dp-ms-r, were synthesised spanning approximately  <dig> bp. the pcr product was cloned and ten independent clones were sequenced. this revealed that the number of at-repeats varied between  <dig> to  <dig>  suggesting that this domain can be considered as a microsatellite  <cit> . this is remarkable as a mt microsatellite was never reported before for species belonging to the chelicerata. also in metazoan mtdna such microsatellites are rare and have, to our knowledge, only been reported for butterflies  <cit> , a dragonfish, scleropages formosus  <cit> , a bat, myotis bechsteinii  <cit> , a turtle, pelomedusa subrufa  <cit>  and several seal species  <cit> .

the second region  holds two short palindromic sequences, tacat and atgta, which are conserved in mt genomes of mammals  <cit>  and fishes  <cit> . they can form a stable stem-loop structure , which might be involved as a recognition site for the arrest of j-strand synthesis  <cit> . near this region other stem-loop structures could be folded  but none of them had flanking sequences similar to those that are conserved in the control region of the mt genome of insects  <cit>  and metastriate ticks  <cit> .

as described before, four other stretches of non-coding nucleotides were found outside the control region. these short sequences can fold into stable stem-loop structures  which may function as splicing recognition sites during processing of the transcripts  <cit> .

ribosomal rnas
12s-rrna and 16s-rrna are located on the j-strand. this does not coincide with their position in most chelicerata where they are located on the n-strand . the at-contents of both genes are comparable  and are within the range of rrnas of other acari . the sizes of the rrnas  are slightly larger than those of other acariform mite rrnas  but are shorter than those found in the parasitiformes  .

the 12s-rrna and 16s-rrna genes of leptotrombidium species  are  <dig> % and  <dig> % shorter than their counterparts in drosophila yakuba. this substantial reduction is mainly caused by the loss of stem-loop structures at the 5'-end of the rrna genes  <cit> . to identify whether similar domains are absent in the rrnas of d. pteronyssinus, we constructed their secondary structures . this revealed that the d. pteronyssinus 12s-rrna indeed lacks similar stem-loops as l. pallidum, compared to d. yakuba. the structure also revealed  <dig> additional stem-loop  not present in 12s-rrna of l. pallidum. like in l. pallidum, one stem-loop replaces three stem-loops  whereas another replaces a region of four stem-loops  of the d. yakuba 12s-rrna  <cit> . based on the modelled structure in combination with an alignment of other acariform 12s-rrnas, the greatest sequence conservation was found in the loop region of stem-loops  <dig> and  <dig> and the region between stem-loops  <dig> and  <dig> 

in analogy to the 16s-rrna gene of l. pallidum, the main deletions of the d. pteronyssinus 16s-rrna are located at the 5'-end. with the exception of d <dig>  all stem-loops of l. pallidum are present in d. pteronyssinus. we also discovered three additional stem-loops  which are absent in the 16s-rrna of l. pallidum. the 3'-end of the 16s-rrna structure is best conserved compared to other acariform 16s-rrnas. this is in agreement with the idea that this region is the main component of the peptidyl-transferase centre, and as such most vulnerable to mutations  <cit> . recently, the 12s-rrna and 16s-rrna secondary structures of s. magnus have been published  <cit> . the 12s-rrna structure of s. magnus has  <dig> extra stem-loops  compared to the one of d. pteronyssinus whereas the 16s-rrna lacks  <dig> stem-loops  and has  <dig> stem-loops  not present in the 16s-rrna of d. pteronyssinus.

it is still an open question how relatively well-conserved structures such as rrnas can dramatically decrease in size while remaining functional. wolstenholme et al.  <cit>  and masta  <cit>  suggested a correlation between the occurrence of truncated rrnas  and the loss of the t-arm in trnas. the coincidence of short rrnas and missing t-arms in trnas was also observed in s. magnus, l. pallidum and d. pteronyssinus. other acariform mites like t. urticae, ascoschoengastia sp. and walchia hayashii also exhibit short rrnas  and the prediction of their trna secondary structures could further support this hypothesis. however, examples contradicting this hypothesis also occur e.g. pulmonate gastropods with trnas lacking t-arms have no truncated rrnas. therefore, it remains possible that truncation of both trnas and rrna genes only reflects an independent trend towards minimisation of the mt genome as suggested by yamazaki et al.  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis
a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on nucleotide and amino acid sequences from all mt protein coding genes of acari. the ild-test  <cit>  indicated a significant incongruence  among data set partitions for nucleotide alignments and low congruence  among data set partitions for amino acid alignments. a considerable debate exists on the utility of this test  <cit> . however, the principle of kluge  <cit>  implies that all data should always be included in a combined analysis for any phylogenetic problem and therefore we combined data partitions for both amino acid and nucleotide alignments for phylogenetic analysis. a maximum parsimony  analysis based on nucleotide alignments  grouped v. destructor  within the acariformes, close to d. pteronyssinus. this is in contrast with the generally accepted view on the phylogeny of the acariformes and parasitiformes  <cit> . as mentioned before, v. destructor and d. pteronyssinus both have a reversal of asymmetrical mutation pattern. when such reversals occurred independently, d. pteronyssinus and v. destructor could have acquired a similar base composition and as a consequence group together due to the long-branch attraction  phenomenon  <cit> . model-based methods such as maximum likelihood  and bayesian inference  are less sensitive to lba  <cit>  and were for this reason considered for phylogenetic analysis.

ml and bi analysis performed on the amino acid data set resolved trees with an identical topology  in which d. pteronyssinus clusters with s. magnus, forming a sistergroup of the trombidiformes. this is in agreement with the most recent views on the classification of the acariformes  <cit> . the nucleotide data set resulted in similar trees, confirming the evolutionary position of d. pteronyssinus . the only major inconsistency over the trees was the position of t. urticae. although this species is generally considered as a member of the trombidiformes  <cit> , it was clustered with the sarcoptiform mites d. pteronyssinus and s. magnus in the trees based on the nucleotide dataset. . however, the position in the different trees is questionable as it is supported by low bootstrap values/bayesian posterior probabilities . adding additional mt genome data from closely related taxa of t. urticae and from taxa located between t. urticae and trombiculidae would probably position t. urticae with higher support values within the trombidiformes.

in the trees based on the nucleotide dataset, h. flava is, compared to a. triguttatum, evolutionary closer related to r. sanguineus while in the trees based on the amino acid dataset this is the opposite. however, as the clustering of h. flava and r. sanguineus is in agreement with the most recent views on the classification of the ixodida  <cit> , we consider the nucleotide topology as the most correct one. murrell et al.  <cit>  considers the parasitiformes to be paraphyletic with respect to the opilioacariformes, but as there are no complete mt genomes of opilioacariformes available, we were not able to verify this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first description of a complete mt genome of a species belonging to the astigmata, a cohort within the sarcoptiformes. although the length, gene and at-content are similar to other acari mtdna, the mt genome of d. pteronyssinus exhibits some interesting features. the gene order of d. pteronyssinus is completely different from that of other acari mt genomes. gene order comparison indicated that mt gene orders seem less useful for deduction of phylogenetic relationships between superorders within the acari. gc- and at-skews of the j-strand were very large and reversed as compared to those found in most metazoan mtdna.

compared to parasitiform mites, both d. pteronyssinus rrnas were considerably shorter and almost all transfer rnas lacked the t-arm. it would be interesting to investigate whether the occurrence of truncated rrnas and the loss of the t-arm in trnas are correlated or just a trend toward minimisation of the mt genome. finally, phylogenetic analysis using concatenated mt gene sequences succeeded in recovering acari relationships concordant with traditional views of phylogeny of acari.
