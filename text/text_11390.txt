BACKGROUND
cotton is the nature fibre crop with the greatest economic importance. cotton verticillium wilt  is a serious soil-borne vascular disease caused by verticillium dahliae <cit> . the disease can cause cotton yellowing, wilt, defoliating, and finally death  <cit> . cvw was first reported in upland cotton in the united states, and spread to china on imported american cotton in  <dig> <cit> . at present, more than  <dig> million hectares of cotton are subject to cvw, and the economic loss is tremendous every year, especially defoliated cvw  <cit> . currently, no fungicides are available to cure commercial upland cotton  once they become infected, although the sea-land cotton species  is immune to v. dahliae. because of the difficulty obtaining a new highly resistant upland cotton breed by cross-breeding of upland cotton and sea-island cotton, no completely suitable high-resistance upland cotton variety exists. the breeding of disease-resistant cultivars remains the primary control method for cotton. at present, the primary method of breeding for disease-resistant cotton is crossbreeding of resistant cotton, which has been used to create a series of varieties with resistance to cvw  <cit> .

in recent years, researchers have investigated the molecular mechanisms of resistance to v. dahliae with the aim of ultimately using genetic engineering to breed cultivars resistant to cvw. resistance to cvw is controlled by a single dominant gene in sea-island cotton, whereas that in upland cotton may be controlled by either a single dominant gene or two dominant genes  <cit> . when cotton is infected by the cvw pathogen, the defence system is activated, generating a series of cascade reactions. three aspects of this system, tissue resistance, physiological and biochemical resistance, and micro-organism resistance, are involved in the mechanism of resistance  <cit> . several v. dahliae resistance-related genes have been isolated and studied, including the following four groups: cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase , farnesyl diphosphate synthase, isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase, the key regulatory enzymes in the synthesis of phytoalexin, which can kill pathogens through increased local concentrations in the plant  <cit>  ; lipid transfer proteins, chitinase, β- <dig>  glucanase, nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related genes  <dig>  thionin, gastrodia antifungal protein, and lectin-like protein, which may play important roles in the response to pathogen infections in cotton plants  <cit>  ; phenylalanine ammonia lyase , cinnamate-4-hydroxylase, peroxisome, polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins, and laccase, which are defence proteins that can slow down the spread of pathogens  <cit>  ; and resistance gene analogues and defence gene analogues that have been cloned and further transformed by genetic engineering for functional research, such as lipid transfer protein, nonrace-specific disease resistance  <dig>  map kinase kinase  <dig>  and others  <cit>  .

the phenylpropanoid pathway plays a key role in cotton resistance to v. dahliae <cit> . even so, the molecular mechanisms of v. dahliae resistance are unclear. in recent years, novel, high-throughput, deep-sequencing transcriptome analysis, termed rna-seq, has made it possible to efficiently generate large-scale expressed sequence tag  libraries and improved the speed of gene discovery  <cit> . although rna-seq technologies have been used for researching gene expression profiles in the resistance response of sea-island cotton to v. dahliae, the phenylpropanoid metabolism pathway and genes associated with lignin metabolism has been found to play a central role  <cit> . whether a different response mechanism to the wilt fungus v. dahliae exists in cotton of different races and whether different response mechanisms exist in different cotton species  are questions for further research. therefore, in this study, four samples, including zhongzhimian kv- <dig>  and xinhai  <dig>  infected with v. dahliae strain v <dig>  and d <dig> , respectively, and two uninfected samples include zhongzhimian kv- <dig>  and xinhai  <dig>  were sequenced in order to addressed the above issues using rna-seq technologies.

RESULTS
illumina sequencing and sequence assembly
a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads  were generated through illumina sequencing and assembled into  <dig>  contigs. then the contigs were further assembled into  <dig>  unigenes, with a mean length of 666 bp. the size distribution indicated that  <dig>   unigenes were 100–500 bp, and 42% unigenes were greater than 500 bp . to evaluate the quality of the data set, the ratio of the gap length to the length of the assembled unigenes was analysed. all of the unigenes showed gap lengths of ≤5%.

functional annotation and classification
all of the unigenes were compared to the sequences in public databases, including the ncbi nonredundant protein  database, the clusters of orthologous groups  database, the swiss-prot protein database, and the kegg database, using blastx with a cutoff e-value of 10- <dig>  a total of  <dig>  unigenes  returned a significant blast result.

the assembled unigenes were compared against the cog database to phylogenetically analyse widespread domain families. the results revealed  <dig>  unigenes with significant homology and assigned them to the appropriate cog clusters. these cog classifications were grouped into  <dig> functional categories . among these cog categories, the cluster 'general function’  represented the largest group, followed by 'transcription’ ; 'replication, recombination, and repair’ ; 'signal transduction mechanisms’ ; 'posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones’ ; 'translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis’ ; and 'carbohydrate transport and metabolism’ .

gene ontology  assignments were used to classify the functions of the predicted cotton genes. based on sequence homology,  <dig>  sequences were categorised into  <dig> functional groups . in each of the three main categories  of the go classification, the major subcategories were as follows: six subcategories for biological process ; three sub-categories for cellular components ; and two sub-categories for molecular function . only a few genes were clustered in terms of 'biological adhesion’ , 'cell killing’ , 'locomotion’ , 'pigmentation’ , 'rhythmic process’ , 'viral reproduction’ , 'cell junction’ , 'extracellular region’ , 'virion’ , and 'translation regulator activity’.

functional classification and pathway assignment were performed using the kegg database  <cit> . in total,  <dig>  unigenes were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways . the major pathways were 'metabolic pathways’ , 'biosynthesis of secondary metabolites’ , 'plant hormone signal transduction’ , and 'plant-pathogen interaction’; the gene numbers and percentages assigned to these pathways were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively.

note: data only showed the annotation unigenes percent of each pathway more than 1%.

dge library sequencing
six cotton digital gene expression  profiling libraries were sequenced , which generated approximately  <dig> to  <dig> million high-quality reads for each library . the percentage of clean reads among the raw reads in each library was >99% . among the clean reads, the number of sequences that could be mapped to unigenes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  million, and the percentage of clean reads was above 79% in the six libraries. as table  <dig> shows, the vast majority of these mapped reads were uniquely matched to unigenes , and the percentage of multi-position matched reads was 24%.

gene expression variation among the different samples
first, to evaluate the dge data, we analysed the distribution of unigene coverage in each sample, which is the number of clean reads that aligned to the reference unigenes. as shown in figure  <dig>  most unigene coverage was >50% . second, the number of clean reads was calculated and the gene expression level was calculated using the reads per kb per million reads method for each unigene, and then the differentially expressed genes  were identified in different samples.

variation in gene expression was identified based on comparisons of the above. the following significant degs were identified:  between samples  <dig>  and  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were up- and downregulated, respectively;  between samples  <dig>  and  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were up- and downregulated, respectively;  between samples  <dig>  and  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were up- and downregulated, respectively; and  between samples  <dig>  and  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were up- and downregulated, respectively .

genes related to resistance to cvw resistance
based on the above comparisons, the degs were functionally analysed using mapman software. the results showed that a total of  <dig> genes occurred simultaneously in the four comparisons above , including  <dig> upregulated genes and  <dig> downregulated genes. these genes were principally associated with cell wall, lipids, and secondary metabolism and so on . to identify cotton genes most associated with resistance to cvw, an absolute value of the fold change times > = <dig> was used as a threshold, resulting in  <dig> degs being screened out .

validation of rna-seq-based gene expression
to validate the assembled sequences and the expression profiles obtained by rna-seq, real-time rt-pcr was performed on  <dig> of the above degs. gene expression levels in v <dig> and the controls were compared using qrt-pcr. of the  <dig> genes, all but gene  <dig>  were detected. for the  <dig> detected genes, the upregulation trend obtained in real-time rt-pcr expression was in agreement with the rna-seq data, except for genes  <dig> and  <dig> . however, for most of the genes, the upregulated range in real-time rt-pcr was lower than in the dge data .

discussion
cotton is an economically important crop, and cotton cvw causes significant economic losses. although some cotton cultivars resistant to v. dahliae have been generated using conventional breeding techniques, the molecular mechanisms of disease resistance in cotton are still unclear. xu et al.  <cit>  found that lignin metabolism is a key pathway in the resistance of cotton, but the authors mainly analysed the rna-seq results by analysing the resistance mechanism of the resistant gossypium barbadense in contrast to the susceptible gossypium hirsutum. are other key genes involved in the resistance of cotton? in this study, we used the commercial upland cotton  variety zhongzhimian kv- <dig> and the sea-island cotton xinhai  <dig>  both highly resistant to v. dahliae, to study the resistance relationships between different cotton species and different v. dahliae strains.

using transcriptome sequence analysis,  <dig> , <dig> reads were obtained, corresponding to about  <dig>  gb of raw sequence data. then the raw sequences were further assembled using the short-reads assembly program trinity and used to predict unigenes. in spite of the genome sequence of a diploid cotton gossypium raimondi had been published, whose progenitor is the putative contributor of the d-subgenome to cotton species gossypium barbadense and gossypium hirsutum <cit> , due to the lack of a-genome sequence information, the d-genome sequence were not used in our bioinformation analysis in this study, and the quality of these assembled unigenes was confirmed by qrt-pcr. the results showed that signals for  <dig> out of  <dig> tested genes were detected, demonstrating the high quality of the assembled results, and also indicating that relatively short reads from illumina sequencing can be effectively assembled and used for novel gene discovery. the  <dig> predicted unigenes were subjected to blast annotation; 78% of the unigenes returned a significant blast result. about 20% of the predicted unigenes could not be assigned annotation information, which may be caused by the limited information about the genomes or transcriptomes of cotton and its related species. some unigenes were too short to allow statistically meaningful matches. from the kegg annotation results,  <dig> unigenes  were found to be involved in the group 'plant-pathogen interaction’, which may be associated with the defence response of cotton to v. dahliae. this group was the fourth largest group in our results, which suggests that it is feasible through the immense capacity of illumina sequencing to discover genes related to cotton resistance to v. dahliae in metabolic pathways.

to understand the regulatory pathways and molecular mechanisms of resistance to v. dahliae, we created six dge libraries to analyse gene expression patterns following inoculation with v. dahliae. about 80% of the reads were mapped to our transcriptome reference database. the high proportion of mapped reads supports the validity of our analysis. the quality of the dge libraries was also confirmed by qrt-pcr analysis. because the cotton disease resistance-related genes may begin to be expressed after inoculation with v. dahlia, cotton seedlings of different species inoculated with different races of v. dahliae were compared to controls. different genes may be involved in disease resistance, and the common genes in the four comparison groups reduced the number of degs that may be related to cotton disease resistance. there were no replicated data using the audic-claverie method in dge data analysing, but the results are credible because we applied a series of correction method, such as: a false discovery rate of < <dig>  and an absolute value of the log  <dig> ratio > <dig> as the threshold were used for judging the significance of the gene expression differences, and combined with the quality results of the dge libraries been further confirmed by qrt-pcr.

the inoculated v. dahliae cotton samples compared with uninoculated samples exhibited much more upregulated genes and downregulated genes, this possibly indicates that v. dahliae activates cotton resistance genes during the infection process. furthermore, the number of upregulated and downregulated genes of g. barbadense was much greater than that in g. hirsutum  in the four compared groups, suggesting that the resistance genes to v.dahliae of the sea-island cotton g. barbadense is more than that of the upland cotton g. hirsutum.

the genes that were upregulated or downregulated more than five fold in the four compared groups are listed in table  <dig>  it is feasible that the functional genes play key roles in the resistance of cotton to v. dahliae. of these genes, the gene unigene5503_kv- <dig> was described as a cellulose synthase-like d gene; cellulose synthase-like genes mediate the synthesis of cell wall -beta-d-glucans and/or are required for cellulose deposition  <cit> . vega-sánchez et al. found a cellulose synthase-like protein related to defence responses of rice plants  <cit> . in our study, the cellulose synthase-like d protein was differentially expressed upon infection of cotton seedlings with v. dahliae. the genes unigene68082_kv- <dig> and unigene67909_kv- <dig> were annotated as encoding xyloglucan endotraglucosylase/hydrolase and xyloglucan 6-xylosyltransferase, respectively. as reported previously, xyloglucan 6-xylosyltransferase can catalyse the formation of udp-d-xylose-d-glucose from udp-d-xylose in xyloglucan, and xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase can degrade xyloglucan  <cit> . xyloglucans play an important role in cross-linking adjacent cellulose microfibrils to form a cellulose-xyloglucan network that constitutes the major load-bearing structure of the primary cell wall. xu et al. found that lignin has a key role in the cotton defence response, suggesting that genes related to cotton cell wall components are involved in the defence response to v. dahlia <cit> . the gene unigene52341_kv- <dig> is similar to the terpene synthase  <dig> gene from populus trichocarpa. danner et al. found that terpene synthase  <dig> can activate both mono- and sesquiterpene synthase in populus trichocarpa <cit> , and in cotton, sesquiterpene phytoalexins are elicited in response to bacterial or fungal infection  <cit> . in conclusion, the four genes mentioned above are probably related to cotton resistance. three of the genes are related to cell-wall compounds and one gene is related to sesquiterpene metabolism, suggesting that the cell wall and sesquiterpene are involved in the resistance of cotton to cvw. these genes are targets of further research in our next study.

note: column 5– <dig> showed the fold change times in four compared groups. 1: kv1/d; 2: xh/d; 3: zkv1/v; 4:xh/v; 5:kv1/u; and 6: xh/u. the 'not assigned.unknown’ genes were not showed.

other reports have shown that the phenylalanine metabolism pathway is related to the cotton defence response to v. dahliae. therefore, in this study, we also analysed this pathway and identified some degs. different cotton species and races of cvw were used in our study. the degs were nearly the same for sea-island cotton and upland cotton infected with different races of v. dahliae, but very different when comparing the two groups of sea-island cotton and the two groups of upland cotton. as shown in figure  <dig>  only one gene, hydroxycinnamoyl transferase , was upregulated and showed a strong change in expression when upland cotton was infected by v. dahliae , but five other genes  were upregulated and obviously changed in sea-island cotton infected by v. dahliae . as the reports, hct can affect lignification in alfalfa, and lignin plays a key role in the cotton defence response, so the same function may exit in upland cotton  <cit> .the results suggest that hct is related to the upland cotton defence response to v. dahlia, but has little role in the sea-island cotton defence response, and the other five genes  may be related to the defence response of sea-island cotton but not that of upland cotton. in other words, different disease-resistance mechanisms may exist in sea-island cotton and upland cotton. this may be the reason that the genes hct and ccoaomt were not identified.

CONCLUSIONS
although the molecular functions of the cotton defence response to v. dahliae and the associated signal transduction pathways remain largely unknown, the present transcriptome analysis provides valuable information regarding cotton resistance, which may facilitate future investigations of the detailed regulatory mechanisms and pathways. using illumina sequencing technology, we obtained about  <dig> gb of raw sequence data and predicted  <dig>  assembled unigenes,  <dig>  of which were able to be annotated. finally  <dig> differentially expressed genes were identified. the results suggest that hct in upland cotton and ccoaomt, pal, 4cl, cad, and comt in sea-island cotton are involved in cotton defence response to v. dahliae. we believe that our data not only provide novel molecular information, but will also help to accelerate research into gene functions of cotton defence responses.
