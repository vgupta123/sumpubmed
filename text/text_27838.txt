BACKGROUND
pleckstrin is an intriguing platelet protein that appears to be involved in reorganization of the cytoskeleton, as well as attenuating various signaling pathways following platelet activation  <cit> . on cloning pleckstrin, two internal repeats consisting of approximately  <dig> amino acids including  <dig> identical residues were identified at the n- and c-termini of the protein  <cit> . similar regions were later recognized in other proteins and these internal repeats were consequently termed pleckstrin homology  domains  <cit> .

since their first identification in pleckstrin, ph domains have been found in over four hundred human proteins  making this domain one of the most common in the human proteome. ph domain-containing proteins are known to be involved in a number of different cellular functions, including phosphoinositide metabolism, protein phosphorylation and cytoskeletal organization, suggesting that ph domains themselves may also function in a variety of different ways . the crystal and solution structures of numerous ph domains have been determined revealing that despite sharing only low sequence similarity, they maintain a highly conserved fold. the domain structure consists of a seven-stranded anti-parallel β-sandwich that is closed at one end by a c-terminal alpha helix and remains open at the other end, where several variable loop regions are located . traditionally, ph domains have been thought to function predominately as phosphoinositide-binding modules, targeting their host proteins to the membrane where they can carry out their various functions. the region known to bind these signaling lipids has been identified as the variable β1–β <dig> loop, with some ph domains contributing additional interacting residues from nearby secondary structure elements. despite their early characterization as phosphoinositide-binding modules, it is now clear that the majority of ph domains do not bind phosphoinositides with sufficient affinity or specificity to drive membrane localization  <cit> , suggesting that alternate functions are likely to exist for these domains. in support of this notion, several reports have shown that within some proteins, ph domains function to mediate protein-protein interactions  <cit> .

given their wide distribution, it is likely that ph domains mediate other processes in addition to protein-protein interactions and membrane association through phosphoinositide-specific binding. in particular, it seems possible that specific soluble inositol phosphates , could bind to ph domains and thereby serve as important regulators  <cit> . inositol phosphates are structurally very similar to the phosphoinositide head groups known to bind to many ph domains. in fact, it has been well established that ph domains can bind inositol phosphates in vitro and have been used extensively in structural and biochemical studies focused on understanding phosphoinositide-ph domain interactions. despite this they have received relatively little consideration as physiological ph domain ligands.

previous studies have shown that phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphate  binds to c-ph much more firmly than other phosphoinositides  <cit>  and that ip <dig> is a potent inhibitor of pleckstrin-phosphoinositide interactions  <cit> . based on these findings, we found that commercial ip <dig> also competed effectively with ptdinsp <dig> for binding to c-ph. as we have recently reported the crystal structure of c-ph in the unliganded form  <cit> , we then set out to determine the structural basis for the interaction with ip <dig>  to our surprise, we found that the complex formed contained d-myo-inositol  <dig> , <dig> ,6-pentakisphosphate , rather than ip <dig>  the structure presented here indicates that inositol polyphosphates can interact specifically with ph domains and therefore lends further support to the idea that at least some inositol phosphates may regulate ph domain phosphoinositide association.

RESULTS
addition of ip <dig> effectively competes for binding of ptdinsp <dig> to c-ph
using large unilamellar vesicles containing  <dig> mol% ptdinsp <dig>  we found that simultaneous addition of ip <dig> was able to prevent the binding of c-ph to ptdinsp <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  the binding of c-ph to ptdinsp <dig> was markedly inhibited by addition of  <dig> μm ip <dig> and completely abolished by  <dig> μm ip <dig>  only trace non-specific binding of c-ph to phosphatidylcholine was observed . using a range of ip <dig> concentrations, the apparent ic <dig> of the ip <dig> used was determined to be  <dig>  μm.

structure of c-ph/ligand complex
to investigate further the nature of the myo-inositol polyphosphate interaction with c-ph, crystals were prepared using recombinant c-ph and ip <dig>  which permitted the determination of a high-resolution crystal structure. crystals of the complex were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method after incubation of c-ph with  <dig> mm ip <dig> . the resulting crystals were of exceptional quality and diffracted to  <dig>  Å. data collection and model refinement statistics are presented in table  <dig>  the structure was solved by molecular replacement using a search model based on the previously determined c-ph crystal structure solved in the absence of ligand . the final model  was well ordered with the exception of an approximately eight-residue loop region between the fifth and sixth beta strands, corresponding to residues 303– <dig>  due to the complete disorder of these residues they could not be built into the final model. the overall structure of c-ph containing bound ligand maintained the folding pattern that is characteristic of the ph domain family. thus, the inositol phosphate ligand was found bound in a loop region of c-ph formed between the first and second beta strands which has been well-characterized in a number of ph domains as the phosphoinositide binding region. examination of the electron density in this region revealed that the bound d-myo-inositol polyphosphate contained only  <dig> phosphate groups rather than the  <dig> found in ip <dig>  model building of the different possible d-myo-inositol pentakisphosphates into the electron density indicated the identity of the bound ligand to be insp <dig>  as no other isomer fits the electron density. the identity of the bound ligand was determined with a high degree of confidence, based on the high-resolution data , the well-ordered electron density in the binding loop and the fact that only the phosphate at the  <dig> position on the inositol ring adopts an axial conformation. the presence of insp <dig> was unexpected as a commercial source of ip <dig> was used in the crystallization experiments. however, if the ip <dig> sample contained ip <dig> hydrolysis products this could account for the presence of insp <dig> in the final c-ph structure. this unexpected finding suggests that c-ph has a much higher affinity for insp <dig> than for ip <dig>  in support of this view, a separate study  <cit>  showed that the ic <dig> for the inhibition of binding of ptdinsp <dig> to c-ph by insp <dig> was  <dig>  μm. hplc analysis of the ip <dig> sample used in these studies using a reverse-phase c <dig> column  revealed the ip <dig> sample was in fact not pure. conditions used to generate ip5-c-ph co-crystals were mild and therefore not likely to have resulted in conversion of ip <dig> to insp <dig>  regardless of the source, insp <dig> was found tightly bound within the phosphoinositide binding pocket of c-ph and provided important information on the binding of d-myo-inositol polyphosphates to ph domains.

analysis of the c-ph/insp <dig> complex
the final model of ip5-bound c-ph was determined at exceptionally high resolution and consequently the interactions observed between ligand and protein  can be reported with a high degree of certainty. table  <dig> lists the specific interactions and distances observed within the crystal structure between insp <dig> and c-ph. insp <dig> was bound to c-ph in the β1–β <dig> loop region , making numerous interactions through all but one of its phosphate groups . the only phosphate group that does not interact with any residues of c-ph is that in the 1-position of myo-inositol. although exposed to solvent, this phosphate remained ordered to the point of generating clear electron density. all amino acids that form stabilizing interactions with insp <dig> are located in the β1–β <dig> loop region with the exception of y <dig> which contributes a hydrogen bond and is situated on the β <dig> strand of c-ph. the 2-phosphate is the only phosphate that adopts an axial position. this configuration is strongly stabilized through interactions with the side chains of r <dig> and k <dig>  unlike the 2-phosphate, the 3-phosphate makes only a single interaction, in this case with y <dig>  as already mentioned, the 4-phosphate is not present in the structure. however the remaining 4-oh group, which represents the location where the additional phosphate group of ip <dig> would be, does make an interaction with the side chain of h <dig> at a distance of  <dig>  Å. all attempts to model in a phosphate group at this position resulted in steric clashes with h <dig> and the main chain of residues r <dig> or g <dig>  depending on the position of the phosphate chosen. in addition, the electron density for h <dig> is well-ordered indicating that this side chain is not mobile and could not adopt a conformation that would accommodate an additional phosphate group at the 4-position. the 5-phosphate of insp <dig> interacts with main chain atoms of h <dig>  r <dig> and n <dig> , as well as the side chain of r <dig>  the final position on the inositol ring is occupied by the 6-phosphate and interacts with the side chain of r <dig> in addition to the main chain of n <dig> through a water molecule. c-ph residues shown here to interact with insp <dig> are also known to be involved in binding ptdinsp <dig>  <cit> . this demonstrates that insp <dig> competes directly with ptdinsp <dig> for binding to c-ph. while it is not known exactly how ptdinsp <dig> interacts with residues in the binding loop, it seems reasonable that two of the phosphates from insp <dig> will directly compete with the phosphates from ptdinsp <dig> while the remaining phosphates will provide additional stabilizing interactions.

comparison of the c-ph/insp <dig> and grp1/insp <dig> structures
although the structure presented here represents the first high resolution structure of insp <dig> bound to a ph domain, the structure of another ph domain complexed with insp <dig> has been reported  <cit> . the ph domain of grp <dig> binds 3-phosphoinositides allowing the protein to participate in regulating the actin cytoskeleton in response to phosphoinositide-3-kinase signaling pathways. as such, the structure of the ph domain of grp <dig> complexed with insp <dig> represents another instance in which specific interactions of an inositol phosphate and the phosphoinositide binding cleft of a ph domain might be expected to regulate the association of the ph domain with a specific phosphoinositide. comparison of the grp <dig> ph domain complexed with insp <dig>  with that of c-ph bound to insp <dig>  revealed some intriguing similarities and differences . although both d-myo-inositol pentakisphosphates are bound in the β1–β <dig> loop region, they adopt slightly different orientations with respect to their inositol rings . remarkably, despite this difference in the overall orientation of the inositol ring, four of the five phosphate groups from each ligand occupy overlapping positions in the β1–β <dig> binding cleft. the 2-phosphate of insp <dig> occupies the same position as the 3-phosphate from insp <dig>  in both structures, the phosphate group at this position interacts with a highly conserved arginine residue . the arginine at this position is conserved amongst a number of ph domains including that of bruton's tyrosine kinase , in which its mutation to either histidine or proline causes the hereditary immune disease x-linked agammaglobulinaemia  <cit> . in the crystal structure of the btk ph domain bound to insp <dig>  it was shown that the conserved arginine  interacts with the 3-phosphate, suggesting that mutation of this residue decreases the affinity of the ph domain for its natural ligand, ptdinsp <dig>  <cit> .

the second overlapping phosphate position is occupied by the  <dig> and 1-phosphates of insp <dig> and insp <dig>  respectively. in the c-ph structure, the 6-phosphate interacts with r <dig>  a residue that is not conserved in the grp <dig> ph domain. the corresponding 1-phosphate of insp <dig> interacts with k <dig> in the grp <dig> ph domain which is equivalent to k <dig> in c-ph, although this residue does not interact with the 6-phosphate of insp <dig> due to the location of its side chain. the 5-phosphate of insp <dig> and the 6-phosphate of insp <dig> occupy the third overlapping position within the phosphoinositide-binding pocket. the 5-phosphate is in position to interact with the main chains of h <dig>  r <dig> and n <dig> as well as the side chain of r <dig> in c-ph. although this arginine is conserved in the grp <dig> ph domain , it does not interact with the 6-phosphate, in fact the 6-phosphate makes less optimal interactions with main chain residues compared to those observed in the c-ph structure. in the fourth and final overlapping position, the 3-phosphate of insp <dig> and the 4-phosphate of insp <dig> both interact with a conserved tyrosine at position  <dig> in c-ph and  <dig> in the grp <dig> ph domain. in addition to this, the 4-phosphate makes further stabilizing contacts with the side chains of h <dig> and k <dig>  interactions that are not observed in the c-ph/insp <dig> structure.

from this structural comparison it can be seen that in both cases the d-myo-inositol pentakisphosphate ligands interact with conserved side chains that would be involved in binding phosphoinositides. this suggests that the d-myo-inositol pentakisphosphates would directly compete with phosphoinositides for binding to the ph domains. in addition to this, it was found that four out of the five phosphates occupy overlapping positions within the binding cleft despite the differences in orientation and even stereochemistry. this overlap in phosphate positions is not simply coincidence, since a structural alignment of various ph domains solved in complex with either insp <dig> or the two d-myo-inositol pentakisphosphates used in the comparison above reveals that the overlapping positions are conserved in these structures as well . the mode of interaction observed in our structure is therefore consistent with the possibility that myo-inositol polyphosphates could act to regulate ph domain-phosphoinositide associations by directly competing with phosphoinositides for binding to ph domains.

d-myo-inositol pentakisphosphates as signaling molecules
the physiological significance of the interaction reported here with respect to platelet signaling pathways is currently unknown and calls for further careful examination. with the exception of ip <dig>  inositol phosphates have only been thought to function with minor roles as second messengers  <cit> . however, as more information becomes available it appears as though these molecules have a much broader role in signaling then was originally appreciated  <cit> . the most well-characterized inositol phosphate second messenger is ip <dig>  produced by phospholipase c-mediated hydrolysis of ptdinsp <dig>  in addition to ip <dig>  it has also been proposed that insp <dig> plays a role in the regulation of cellular ca+ <dig> fluxes  <cit> . the ip <dig> family of d-myo-inositol pentakisphosphates represents one of the most abundant forms of inositol phosphates present in mammalian cells. although six possible isomers exist, insp <dig> represents the predominant form observed in mammalian cells, including platelets  <cit> . other ip <dig> isomers including insp <dig> and insp <dig> have been detected in a number of cell lines  <cit> , demonstrating that these molecules are indeed present in mammalian cells and as such could play roles in regulating biological functions. in agreement with this, several recent studies have provided evidence suggesting specific roles for ip <dig> isomers ranging from the regulation of chromatin remodeling  <cit>  to salmonella pathogenesis  <cit> . in further support of this idea, insp <dig> was recently shown to be capable of promoting apoptosis and to possess antiangiogenic and antitumor effects as a result of its ability to inhibit the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/akt signaling pathway  <cit> . this inhibition was shown to be a consequence of insp <dig> competing with ptdinsp <dig> for binding to the protein kinase b  ph domain, ultimately preventing the phosphorylation and activation of akt. based on these intriguing results the authors have proposed that insp <dig> and potentially other inositol phosphates can be used as experimental or possibly therapeutic tools that interfere with the binding of ph domains involved in signaling pathways. inositol pyrophosphates, specifically ip <dig> and ip <dig>  have also been shown to act as signaling molecules that regulate ph domain interactions with phosphoinositides  <cit> . in this study ip <dig> and ip <dig> were shown to compete with ptdinsp <dig> for binding to several ph domain-containing proteins in dictyostelium, resulting in an effect on chemotaxis. as the body of evidence continues to grow, it appears that ph domains will emerge as versatile domains capable of mediating interactions with a range of different ligands.

it therefore seems likely that as more studies are aimed at examining the roles of ip <dig> isomers, it will become apparent that this family of inositol phosphates is involved in signaling pathways that affect a range of physiological processes. the identification of ph domains capable of interacting specifically with the various ip <dig> isomers will aid in characterizing the roles of the latter. however, we are not aware of any report of the presence of insp <dig> in platelets or other cells at the present time. it will therefore be important to investigate the effects of other ip <dig> isomers on the binding of pleckstrin c-ph domain to ptdinsp <dig>  it has not escaped our attention that in addition to acting as antagonists of pleckstrin binding by specific phosphoinositides, myo-inositol polyphosphates with high affinities for c-ph could act as regulators of the interaction of pleckstrin with other proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
in the work presented here, the addition of commercial ip <dig> was shown to compete with ptdinsp <dig> for binding to c-ph. since insp <dig> was found bound to c-ph in the crystal structure it would appear that the inhibitory effects observed in the binding studies were due to contamination of ip <dig> with insp <dig>  which binds to c-ph with a higher affinity. regardless of its source, insp <dig> binds specifically in the phosphoinositide binding cleft of c-ph making numerous interactions with residues known to be involved in binding ptdinsp <dig> <cit> . in a structural comparison with the grp <dig> ph domain bound to insp <dig> it was observed that despite differences in their arrangement about the inositol ring, four out of the five phosphate groups from these two ligands occupy conserved positions. this structural analysis, in combination with other recently published data discussed above, suggests that myo-inositol pentakisphosphates could act to regulate ph domain-phosphoinositide interactions by directly competing for binding to these domains. it is also possible that myo-inositol pentakisphosphates could play roles in signaling pathways by acting as inducers of protein-protein interactions.
