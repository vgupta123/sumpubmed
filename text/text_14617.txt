BACKGROUND
identification of promoters is an important issue in biology, given that they are central in understanding the process by which genes are regulated.  wet-lab methods for promoter identification provide accuracy but suffer from being time-consuming.  in order to facilitate faster processing, computational methods are required.  although far from perfect, they do provide a means for quickly identifying potential targets for experimental validation.

several computational methods for promoter prediction have been proposed. most include some analysis of patterns commonly found in promoter regions, such as - <dig> and - <dig> motifs  <cit> .  however, these patterns are not always sufficiently conserved to allow for adequate prediction.  furthermore, there are clearly other factors not directly related to sequence motifs that are closely associated with promoter regions.  

recent studies have reported impressive results using dna structural properties as predictors of promoter regions  <cit> .  these methods include dna curvature  <cit> , relative stability  <cit> , and stress-induced duplex destabilization   <cit> .  of interest in this paper is promoter prediction using sidd properties.  in  <cit> , some of the most impressive results to date are reported for e. coli k <dig>   these were achieved simply using a minimum sidd threshold value for distinguishing promoters from non-promoters.  the current study proposes a more sophisticated approach, involving the use of artificial neural networks , along with sidd profiles, for promoter prediction. 

RESULTS
a comparison of threshold and ann methods for sidd-based promoter prediction was assessed using e. coli k <dig>   first, the sidd profile for the e. coli k <dig> genome was obtained from benham  <cit> .  for this dataset, each base pair  is represented by its destabilization free energy, g.  g corresponds to the incremental free energy needed for the base pair at position x to always remain open.

training and testing sets construction
the training/testing dataset was constructed from the sidd profile.  positive instances  were defined as the  <dig> bp region from - <dig> to + <dig>  with respect to known transcription start sites .  this range covers the areas of lowest sidd energy levels surrounding promoters regions, as shown in figure  <dig>   the negative instances were randomly selected  <dig> bp regions, excluding any located within the previously defined promoter regions.  this dataset was composed on  <dig> positive instances and  <dig> negative instances.  a randomly selected two-third and one-third split was used for training and testing sets, respectively.

comparison of prediction methods
promoters are strongly associated with regions of low sidd energy .  this forms the basis for prediction by thresholds.  for this method, the sum of the sidd energies, sumg, for each of the  <dig> bp testing set instance was calculated.  instances with sumg less than or equal to a selected threshold, t, were tagged promoters.  for predictions using the anns, classifiers were built from the training set and evaluated on the testing set.

comparison of ann promoter prediction with that of prediction using sumg thresholds was based on precision and recall.  the first evaluation made use of precision-recall curves , which plot recall against precision over a range of values.  the prc for sumg was derived from predictions at varying thresholds.  generating a series of precision-recall pairs for the anns was not as straightforward, as there was no single variable that could be adjusted in order to produce somewhat predictable precision-recall results.  the ann application that was used did, however, provide a means of specifying costs for true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.  by varying the costs for these measures, several artificial neural networks were produced and corresponding precision-recall pairs were used to produce the prc shown in figure  <dig>  along with that of sumg.  note that recall distances on the x-axis are not equal due to the difficulty in producing exact recall values from classifiers, particularly neural networks.

predictions were impressive for both classifiers and show that sidd can be useful in distinguishing promoter and non-promoter regions.  with exceptions for conditions of high precision where the two classifiers were nearly equal, predictions for anns outperformed sumg over a wide range.  for example, at equal precision of 61% for both classifiers, the recall of the ann was at 60%, while sumg was at 50%.  this represents  <dig> correctly predicted promoters for the ann and  <dig> for sumg.

in order to compare predictions using a one-dimensional performance measure, the weighted average  over all precision-recall pairs was computed for the ann and sumg methods.  this measure is known as the f-score.  the maximal f-score score for all precisions-recall pairs was identified.  the resulting values were  <dig>   for the ann and  <dig>   for sumg.  again, the ann classifier showed a noticeable improvement over sumg.

a comparison was also made for a combined ann-sumg classifier.  using f-scores of  <dig> and  <dig> for the ann and sumg classifiers, respectively, a decision tree was built from their combined predictions using the weka data mining suiteâ€™s j <dig> algorithm  <cit> .  the f-score of the resulting classifier was  <dig>   because a large percentage of the correct predictions made by sumg were also made by the ann, there was no significant improvement.

the differences in the prediction ability of the ann and sumg methods result from the way they recognize promoter regions.  the sumg method is only able to identify sidd regions whose summations fall above or below a specified threshold.  this differs from anns, which are known for their ability to detect patterns.  for example, figure  <dig> shows the average g at each position in the range from - <dig> to + <dig>  relative to tsss.  it can be seen that a particular pattern emerges.  the lowest energy values are present near the tsss and gradually increase with distance; more so in the downstream direction.  other noticeable patterns also appear near the tsss.  anns were able to recognize differences in sidd energy levels, as with sumg.  but, it is likely that their additional ability to recognize patterns such as in figure  <dig>  that gives them the advantage over the threshold method.

CONCLUSIONS
dna structural features are increasingly being recognized as an important tool for detecting promoters.  promoter prediction based on sidd information has shown promising results.  however, the current prediction method used is based simply on determining if the energy values of particular sidd regions fall below a threshold.  artificial neural networks were used to predict promoters based on sidd profile data.  results using this technique showed noticeable improvements over the current threshold method.

future research will involve combining sidd-based ann promoter predictors with other methods.  in  <cit>  it was shown that sidd was not directly related to primary sequences or unique motifs, and not positively correlated with dna curvature.  thus, using sidd with other predictive sequence and structural properties, particularly those not strongly correlated, may be gainful.  this was the approach taken in  <cit> .

in addition, it may be useful to determine whether neural networks trained on one genome predict well on others.  wang and benham  <cit>  noted nearly identical thresholds for sidd summation parameters for e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis predictions, when illustrating how sidd properties could be used for estimating the probability that a dna fragment contained a promoter.  this will become practical as sidd profiles for other genomes become more readily available.
