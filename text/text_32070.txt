BACKGROUND
bacterial enzymes have been known to play a major role in the pathogenesis of burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis. this bacterium is known to secrete a number of enzymes such as protease, catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, phosphatase and phospholipase c , which are said to contribute to the virulence of the organism  <cit> .

in our previous study  <cit> , high levels of leucine aminopeptidase  enzymatic activity had been detected in both clinical and environmental isolates of b. pseudomallei, by apizym analysis . lap which belongs to the peptidase m <dig> family, is involved in the processing and regular turnover of intracellular proteins by catalyzing the removal of unsubstituted n-terminal amino acids from various peptides  <cit> . besides proteolytic activities, this enzyme is also known to play an important role as a dna-binding protein in escherichia coli <cit> , and a repressor or activator in the operon regulation of virulence-associated genes in e. coli, vibrio cholerae and pseudomonas aeruginosa <cit> . the lap enzyme has been proposed as an immunoantigen for vaccination against fasciola hepatica in sheep  <cit>  and a promising drug target for helicobacter pylori infections  <cit> .

as there has not been any study on lap of b. pseudomallei, the objective of the present study was to characterise the lap activity of b. pseudomallei and to examine the intra- and inter-species variation in the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the lap encoding gene . a pepa/pcr-rflp was designed to facilitate the identification of lap sequence types and for possible differentiation of phenotypically identical b. pseudomallei isolates.

methods
extraction of lap
one milliliter of an overnight-culture of b. pseudomallei nctc  <dig>  was inoculated into  <dig> liters of bhi broth and incubated at 37°c for 72 h with constant agitation at 120 rpm in a shaker . the bacterial cells were removed by centrifugation at  <dig>  rpm for 30 min at 4°c, and the flow-through filtered using a  <dig>  μm polyethersulfone membrane . one part of the filtrate was mixed with  <dig> parts of cold saturated ammonium sulfate solution for 10 min with stirring, prior to centrifugation at  <dig>  rpm for 45 min at 4°c. the precipitate was dissolved in cold 50 mm tris-hcl buffer . desalting was performed using hiprep 26/ <dig> desalting column  coupled to a akta™ explorer  <dig> system . the eluent was concentrated using a vivaspin 15r column  by centrifugation at  <dig>  g. the protein concentration of the sample was determined by quick start™ bradford protein assay  using bovine serum albumin as the standard.

zymographic analysis
zymographic analysis was performed to detect the presence of lap activity in the crude extract of b. pseudomallei nctc  <dig>  the extract was diluted  <dig> fold  and mixed with nativepage™ buffer   in a ratio of 3: <dig>  the sample was analysed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  using a one mm-thick gel  in a mini-protean® tetra cell  page apparatus at 90 v for 120 min. the gel was incubated at 37°c for 10 min in 50 mm tris-hcl buffer  containing  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig> and 200 μm l-leucine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin•hcl  dissolved in  <dig>  ml acetone  <cit> . five microliters of  <dig> x aminopeptidase i from streptomyces griseus  was used as positive control for lap. a fluorescent band similar to the control, representing lap activity was visualised under uv light and photographed.

enzymatic characterisation
lap activity of the crude extract was quantitated as described by wahid et al. <cit> . eighty microliters of the extract was added to 20 μl of 10 mm l-leucine-p-nitroanilide substrate solution  and 100 μl of 50 mm tris-hcl buffer  in a microtiter well, followed by incubation at 37°c for 2 h. the reaction was stopped by cooling the mixture on ice for 10 min and the optical density at 405 nm was measured using a microplate reader . the lap activity was quantitated by using a l-leucine-p-nitroaniline  calibration curve and defined as nanomoles of p-na released per minute per milliliter of sample under the assay conditions.

the optimum ph for lap activity was determined by incubating 80 μl of the concentrated bacterial extract with 100 μl of 50 mm buffer solutions prepared at various phs:  <dig> – <dig>  ,  <dig> – <dig>  ,  <dig> – <dig>   and  <dig> – <dig>  . eighty microliters of the concentrated crude extract was mixed thoroughly with 100 μl buffer of various ph in a microtiter well at 30°c for 10 min, before addition of 20 μl of substrate solution. the mixtures were incubated at 37°c for 2 h and the lap activity was determined as described above.

the effect of temperature on lap activity was studied by incubating for 2 h, 80 μl of the concentrated bacterial extract with 100 μl of 50 mm tris-hcl buffer  and 20 μl of 10 mm l-leucine-p-nitroanilide substrate solution at different temperatures . the effect of metallic ions and other inhibitors on the lap activity was investigated by exposing 80 μl of the extract to 10 μl of solution containing metallic ions , ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid  ,  <dig> -phenanthroline , phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride  and amastatin   and 90 μl of 50 mm tris-hcl buffer . each mixture was pre-incubated at 30°c for 30 min before addition of 20 μl of the substrate solution. following further incubation at 37°c for 2 h, the lap activity of each reaction was determined as described above.

sequence determination and analysis of lap gene
pcr primers  were designed using computer software primer <dig>   and tm calculation for oligos   for amplification of a 930 bp fragment encompassing the central region of the pepa gene, using sequences retrieved from b. pseudomallei reference strains: 1106a , k <dig> ,  <dig> , 1710b  and mshr <dig>  and  <dig> different pulsotypes of b. pseudomallei from a previous study  <cit> . pure colonies of b. pseudomallei on lb agar were suspended in 500 μl miliq water, heated to 100°c for 30 min and cooled in ice for 10 min before centrifugation at  <dig>  rpm for 10 min. the clear supernatants were used as dna templates for amplification. each pcr reaction was performed by preparing a 25 μl reaction mixture containing  <dig>  μm of primers pepa273-f and pepa1202-r,  <dig>  mm of dntp,  <dig>  u/μl of dreamtaq™ dna polymerase ,  <dig> x dreamtaq™ buffer,  <dig>  μl of dh2o and 5 μl of template dna. pcr conditions were: one cycle at  <dig> °c for 5 min, and 30 cycles at  <dig> °c for 1 min,  <dig> °c for 30 s,  <dig> °c for  <dig>  min, followed by one cycle of final extension at  <dig> °c for 5 min. the pcr products were purified using geneall® expin™ combo gp  and sequenced using primers pepa273-f, pepa1202-r, pepa442-f  and pepa1037-r  in an applied biosystems abi3730xl automatic sequencer. the contigs of pepa gene sequences were assembled and edited using geneious pro  <dig> . <dig>  and aligned using mega  <dig> . <dig> software.

rflp analysis of lap gene fragments
a pcr-rflp assay was designed based on the pepa sequences. a total of  <dig> randomly selected clinical isolates of b. pseudomallei from malaysia and  <dig> environmental isolates  and  <dig> b. thailandensis isolates were used. in additional file 1: table s <dig> shows the origins of the b. pseudomallei isolates. partial fragments  of pepa gene were amplified from each isolate using primers pepa442-f and pepa1037-r using pcr conditions as described above, except for a higher annealing temperature of  <dig> °c. the amplified products were purified and subjected to digestion using stui followed by hincii restriction endonucleases . the rflp products were analysed by non-denaturing page using 12% polyacrylamide gel and stained with  <dig>  μg/ml ethidium bromide. an o’generuler™ ultra low range dna ladder  was used as molecular weight marker.

RESULTS
the pepa gene of b. pseudomallei consists of  <dig> nucleotides and encodes for  <dig> amino acids. the predicted molecular mass of the expressed protein was  <dig>  kd . in the zymographic analysis, a fragment with fluorescent activity was observed in the native gel loaded with the concentrated culture supernatant of b. pseudomallei nctc  <dig> . the enzyme activity was detected in the culture supernatant, suggesting that lap is a bacterial secretory product, detectable at temperatures ranging from 30°c to 60°c  and ph ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> . the optimal lap activity was at ph  <dig> and at 50°c. high optimum temperature has been reported for other laps: i.e. 60°c for tomatoes, e. coli and swine  <cit>  and 70°c for arabidopsis <cit> , whereas the alkaline ph of lap has been reported for organisms such as e. coli and arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . the alkaline ph is said to facilitate the interaction between unprotonated n-terminus substrate and hydrophobic core of lap in order to hydrolyse the substrate  <cit> . the optimum activity of lap at high temperature and ph  may be an essential factor for b. pseudomallei to be extremely adaptable in a wide variety of environments and able to survive during nutritional deprivation and exposure to high temperature  <cit> .

the effects of metal ions and inhibitors on lap activity are shown in table  <dig>  there was enhancement of lap activity in the presence of metal ions, in the order of mg2+ > ca2+ > na+ > k+. this observation is in agreement with previous studies whereby a broad range of metal-ion dependence has been demonstrated by metallo-aminopeptidases: i.e. mn2+ by laps of e. coli <cit> , mn2+ by human cytosolic aminopeptidase  <cit>  and ca2+ by streptomyces griseus <cit> . in contrast, edta,  <dig> -phenanthroline and amastatin inhibited lap activity completely whereas mn2+ and zn2+ exhibited partial inhibitory effects . inhibition by chelating agents  is common in animal, plant and prokaryotic laps  <cit> . the inhibitory effects exerted by the chelating agents are suggestive that the enzyme is a metalloprotease. amastatin which mimics the lap catalytic transition state, is a strong inhibitor of animal aminopeptidases  <cit> . hence, inhibition of lap activity by this specific aminopeptidase inhibitor- amastatin, confirmed the identity of this enzyme as an aminopeptidase, as also described for lap of streptomyces hygroscopicus <cit> . the lap enzyme is probably not a serine protease as little impact was observed by the addition of serine protease inhibitor pmsf .

comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the central region of the pepa gene  of b. pseudomallei reference strains: 1106a , k <dig> ,  <dig> , 1710b  and mshr <dig>  and  <dig> pulsotypes of malaysian isolates of b. pseudomallei revealed  <dig> lap sequence types . nucleotide polymorphism was found at  <dig> positions:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  of which two at positions  <dig> and  <dig> are being reported for the first time. examination of the deduced amino acid sequences of the enzyme shows three amino acid differences, i.e. position  <dig> in b. pseudomallei mshr346; position  <dig> in strain  <dig> and position  <dig> in b. pseudomallei 1710b, strains  <dig> and  <dig> 

five sequence types were identified from the  <dig> different pulsotypes representing the genetic diversity of b. pseudomallei isolates in malaysia: the majority  were identical to b. pseudomallei strain 1106a, and  <dig> to b. pseudomallei strain  <dig>  three strains  were new sequence types  suggesting slight differences existed in the conserved pepa gene sequence between isolates from malaysia and those in the genbank database.  shows the comparison of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of pepa gene of b. pseudomallei  with the closely related species . between b. pseudomallei k <dig> and b. thailandensis e <dig>  there was only  <dig> % similarity in the nucleotide sequences. comparison of  <dig> b. pseudomallei strains k <dig>  1710b, mshr <dig> and b. mallei atcc  <dig> showed only one amino acid difference. however, comparison of b. pseudomallei strain k <dig> with b. thailandensis and b. oklahomensis showed  <dig> amino acid differences.

restriction analysis using stui and hincii of the amplified pepa gene enabled the identification of  <dig> restriction fragment polymorphism patterns  for b. pseudomallei: i.e. type i with fragments of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 20 bp; type ii with fragments of  <dig> and 233 bp and type iii with fragments of  <dig>   <dig> and 83 bp . type i  and type ii  pepa/rflp types were predominant amongst our clinical and environmental isolates, respectively .

CONCLUSIONS
to the best of our knowledge there are no published reports on the presence or characterization of lap in b. pseudomallei. dna sequencing of  <dig> different pulsotypes of b. pseudomallei isolates showed that the partial pepa gene sequence was highly conserved, with the detection of  <dig> extra intraspecific nucleotide divergences . we describe here the characteristics of b. pseudomallei lap: high optimum temperature , alkaline optimum ph , requirement of divalent metal ions  for activity, and inhibition by lap-specific inhibitors  and some metal ions . the high lap activity detected in both b. pseudomallei and b. thailandensis in both previous  <cit>  and this study, suggests that lap is probably a housekeeping enzyme rather than a virulence determinant. however, to verify whether lap is truly a housekeeping gene, the use of a deletion mutant of lap from b. pseudomallei will be needed. in addition, since iron is often correlated with virulence phenotypes, the effect of iron on the lap activity should be determined. further work to clone and express lap as a recombinant protein is ongoing.
