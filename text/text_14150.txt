BACKGROUND
watermelon  belongs to the cucurbitaceae family. according to the latest statistical data from the fao , more than  <dig> million tons of watermelon fruit were produced in  <dig>  and the production of watermelon fruit accounts for ~ <dig> % of worldwide vegetable production  <cit> . the differences in the shape, size, rind thickness and color, flesh texture and color, sugar content, carotenoid content, aroma, flavor, and nutrient composition of the fruit make watermelon an important and well-known component of the daily nutrition of the world’s population and an attractive model of non-climacteric fleshy fruit. the exploration and characterization of the regulatory transcription factors and molecular mechanisms that influence fruit ripening and the formation of attractive characteristics of watermelon fruit would be extremely meaningful for watermelon research and breeding efforts directed at improving this crop.

fruit ripening is a highly coordinated, genetically programmed and irreversible process involving a series of physiological, biochemical, and organoleptic changes that result in the development of an edible ripe fruit  <cit> . fruit development and ripening are regulated by phytohormones, light, temperature, and gene regulation  <cit> . numerous studies on fruit ripening in a variety of plant species have suggested that the coordinated expression of a set of genes is a major mechanism influencing fruit ripening. however, the available data regarding the genes associated with fruit growth and ripening in watermelon are limited. recently, the development and boom of rna-seq technology has resulted in its successful application in the analysis of changes in the transcriptome of watermelon fruit. a subtracted and normalized cdna library representing fruit ripening generated  <dig> expressed sequence tags   <cit> , and  <dig> of these were found to be differentially expressed during fruit ripening and were classified into the following ten categories: primary metabolism, amino acid synthesis, protein processing and degradation, membrane and transport, cell division, cytoskeleton, cell wall and metabolism, dna- and rna-related gene expression, signal transduction, and defense- and stress-related genes  <cit> . a digital expression analysis of a larger collection of watermelon ests showed that  <dig> genes that are differentially expressed during watermelon fruit development and ripening are involved in the calvin cycle, cellulose biosynthesis, ethylene biosynthesis, glycolysis ii and iv, gluconeogenesis, sucrose degradation, the citrulline-nitric oxide cycle, trans-lycopene biosynthesis, β-carotene biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis  <cit> . after the watermelon genome sequence was published  <cit> , a downstream functional genomics study on the transcriptome of the flesh of cultivated watermelon ’ <dig> ’ and wild watermelon ‘pi296341-fr’ identified  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes  during fruit development, respectively. a gene ontology  analysis of these genes revealed that the biological mechanisms and metabolic pathways associated with fruit value, such as sweetness and flavor, noticeably changed only in the flesh of  <dig>  during fruit growth, whereas those associated with abiotic stress were altered primarily in the pi296341-fr flesh  <cit> . earlier studies have not yet addressed the question which genes are involved in the process of fruit ripening and the key metabolic pathways important for fruit ripening in cultivated watermelon have not been determined. furthermore, the gene expression profiles during the development of pale-yellow-flesh watermelon fruit have not been studied. the aim of our study was to comparatively analyze the transcriptomes of two contrasting watermelon genotypes, i.e., red-flesh and pale-yellow-flesh watermelon , throughout growth during ripening to reveal the genes associated with the development and ripening of citrullus lanatus fruit and to provide further insights for identifying key potential pathways and regulators involved in the development and ripening of cultivated watermelon fruit.

RESULTS
variations in the soluble sugar and lycopene contents during the ripening of cos and lsw <dig> fruits
the soluble sugar and lycopene contents of watermelon fruit largely determine its quality. hence, the soluble sugar and lycopene contents of cos and lsw <dig> were measured during fruit ripening. previous reports have emphasized the existence of different maturation stages regarding flesh quality. immature white flesh, white-pink flesh, red flesh, and full-ripe  are the four critical ripening stages of red-flesh cultivated watermelon  <cit> . to obtain insights into the development of watermelon fruit, we included an over-ripening stage  in addition to the other four stages in our experiments analyzing the ripening of watermelon fruit . in ripened watermelon fruit, the dominant soluble sugars are sucrose, fructose, and glucose. the trends of the changes in the soluble sugar contents are shown in fig.  <dig>  the total soluble sugar , sucrose, and fructose contents peaked during fruit ripening but decreased during over-ripening in both cos and lsw <dig> . the tss content in cos was markedly higher than that in lsw <dig> during fruit ripening . from  <dig> to  <dig> dap, the fructose concentration in cos was higher than that in lsw <dig> , whereas the sucrose content in cos was lower than that in lsw <dig> . in addition, the glucose content peaked at the early stage of fruit ripening in the two cultivars and was rapidly restored to the baseline value during the period from  <dig> dap in cos and  <dig> dap in lsw <dig> to  <dig> dap . moreover, the glucose content in cos was higher than that in lsw <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig> dap. notably, the lycopene content in lsw <dig> significantly increased during fruit ripening and decreased slightly during over-ripening , whereas the lycopene content in cos was markedly lower than that in lsw <dig> and changed steadily from  <dig> to  <dig> dap. these findings suggest that the qualities of cos and lsw <dig> fruits are significantly different during fruit development and ripening.fig.  <dig> fruit of watermelon cultivars cos and lsw <dig> at critical development stages. cos fruit:  <dig> dap ,  <dig> dap ,  <dig> dap ,  <dig> dap , and  <dig> dap . lsw <dig> fruit:  <dig> dap ,  <dig> dap ,  <dig> dap ,  <dig> dap , and  <dig> dap

sequencing and transcript assembly identify novel genes expressed in watermelon during fruit ripening
in a recent study  <cit> , we characterized the carotenoid contents in cos and lsw <dig>  and these two cultivars were selected for further study due to their different lycopene contents and the degree of difference in their mechanisms regulating lycopene accumulation during fruit ripening. a total of  <dig> cdna libraries prepared from fruit flesh samples at the four critical ripening stages and one over-ripening stage  were sequenced . the raw sequencing data were assessed for quality and subjected to data filtering, and  <dig> million clean paired-end reads of 125 bp in length were obtained for further analysis. all of the clean reads were deposited in the ncbi short read archive  database under the accession numbers srx <dig> and srx <dig> 

the fragments were mapped to the high-quality watermelon reference genome  <cit>  using tophat  <cit> . a total of  <dig> million reads were aligned to the reference genome, yielding an overall mapping percentage of  <dig> % with a standard deviation of  <dig> % . ultimately,  <dig>  genes with  <dig>  transcripts were identified by cufflinks and used as reference transcripts to determine the read count using htseq-count.table  <dig> number of clean reads generated from each sample were sequenced and mapped to the  <dig> genome using tophat




the expression data generated in our study improve the previous annotations of the watermelon genome, which has  <dig>  predicted genes  <cit> . genome-guided assemblies were performed to serve as sequence verification for transcriptome re-annotation in watermelon fruit during ripening. we identified  <dig> novel genes corresponding to  <dig> transcripts with a typical length of 2535 bp , and these identifications mainly resulted from the unknown intergenic transcripts and the opposite strands of the annotated genes. these novel genes were functionally annotated by aligning the gene sequences to the ncbi non-redundant   <cit> , swissprot  <cit> , go  <cit> , and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes   <cit>  protein databases  by blastx to identify the proteins with the same peak sequence as the compatible novel genes . ultimately,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the novel genes were successfully annotated in the four protein databases, respectively.

degs analysis of cos and lsw <dig> during fruit ripening
to categorize the degs during fruit ripening, we used a stringent value of fdr ≤  <dig>  and an absolute value of log <dig> ratio ≥  <dig> as the thresholds for identifying significant differences in gene expression between two close stages  during fruit ripening. as a result,  <dig> developmental degs in cos and  <dig> developmental degs in lsw <dig> were obtained for further analysis . the degs in cos and lsw <dig> were further analyzed at each stage during fruit ripening . at  <dig> dap,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in cos and lsw <dig>  respectively, whereas only  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in both cultivars. however, at  <dig> dap,  <dig> degs were detected in cos, and this peak in the number of degs in cos revealed the significance of this period. the number of degs at later time points was markedly lower than that in cos at  <dig> dap. over time, the number of degs in cos markedly decreased to  <dig> at  <dig> dap and  <dig> at  <dig> dap, indicating that the fruit growth rate of cos started to slow down and that the fruit was already ripe or in the over-ripening state. in contrast, the number of degs in lsw <dig> did not peak until  <dig> dap and then decreased significantly to  <dig> at  <dig> dap, which suggests that the duration of the mature stage of lsw <dig> was longer than that of cos. in addition, the analysis identified few degs that were differentially expressed in both cultivars.fig.  <dig> distribution of differentially expressed genes  on different days after pollination during watermelon fruit development and ripening. overlap in the venn diagram indicates that the degs appeared in both samples represented by the circles. the bar chart represents the distribution of degs in different samples. light green and light brown represent the degs in cos and lsw <dig>  respectively




verification of the expression of some degs detected during fruit ripening
quantitative real-time pcr  analysis was performed to validate our transcriptome profiling dataset of procured genes by correlating their qpcr results with standard data from the rna-seq analysis . we observed clear positive correlations between the qpcr and rna-seq data for these two cultivars at the overall fruit ripening stages . statistical analysis indicated that the disparity between the qpcr and rna-seq results depended on the expression levels of the genes under study. hence, for genes with very low or high expression levels, qpcr verification was less reliable.

go term analysis of degs
to examine the expression profiles of the identified degs,  <dig> degs from cos and  <dig> degs from lsw <dig> were clustered into  <dig> profiles by short time-series expression miner   <cit> . specifically,  <dig> degs from cos were clustered into eight profiles , including two types of downregulated patterns , three upregulated patterns , and three biphasic expression patterns  , whereas  <dig> degs from lsw <dig> were clustered into seven profiles , including two downregulated patterns , three upregulated patterns , and two biphasic expression patterns  . the degs within the up- and downregulated cluster groups established for cos and lsw <dig> were then subjected to go term analysis  and allocated into three core categories, e.g., cellular component, biological process, and molecular function. within the cellular component category, a significant number of upregulated and downregulated degs were divided into cell, cell parts and organelles. within the biological process category, most of the degs were classified into cellular process and metabolic process. within the molecular function category, catalytic activity and binding were the subcategories containing the most degs.fig.  <dig> significantly enriched profiles  during fruit ripening as revealed by time-course analysis. profiles in cos  and lsw <dig> . the profiles were classified into three groups, up , bi , and down , and further ordered based on their profile number following the number of genes in the bracket . the p value assigned to each profile is shown in the bottom left-hand corner. significantly different profiles are represented by different background colors




kegg pathway enrichment analysis of degs
the degs in cos and lsw <dig> were subjected to a kegg pathway enrichment analysis, and  <dig> %  of the degs in cos could be annotated into  <dig> different metabolic pathways . figure 5a shows the top  <dig> most significantly enriched metabolic/biological pathways with annotation for each highly represented profile in cos. in contrast,  <dig> %  of the degs in lsw <dig> could be assigned to  <dig> different metabolic pathways , and the  <dig> top kegg pathways with the most representation are shown in fig. 5b. of these kegg pathways, galactose metabolism , starch and sucrose metabolism , plant hormone signal transduction , alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism , plant-pathogen interaction , phenylpropanoid biosynthesis , arginine biosynthesis ; photosynthesis-antenna proteins , and carotenoid biosynthesis  were the kegg pathways identified in both cos and lsw <dig>  notably, more degs in lsw <dig> during fruit ripening than in cos were significantly enriched in carotenoid biosynthesis , whereas the degs in cos were more significantly involved in pathways associated with plant hormone signal transduction  and starch and sucrose metabolism . profile  <dig> contained mostly degs from the eight highly represented profiles in cos, and their expression was consistently downregulated during fruit ripening. genes involved in plant hormone signal transduction and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism were significantly enriched in profile  <dig>  the enriched categories of the degs in profile  <dig> mainly included amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, galactose metabolism, and starch and sucrose metabolism; the expression of these genes increased at the initial stage and was unchanged during fruit ripening. the expression profile of  <dig> clusters, including the enriched categories of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis, and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, increased by  <dig> dap and gradually decreased from  <dig> to  <dig> dap during fruit ripening. the expression of the genes in profile  <dig> of lsw <dig> consistently increased during fruit ripening, and this profile was enriched in genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis and photosynthesis. with the highest degree of functional enrichment, profile  <dig> contained approximately half of the enriched categories in the seven highly represented profiles in lsw <dig>  including genes involved in galactose metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, and carotenoid biosynthesis.fig.  <dig> top  <dig> kegg pathways sorted by p value for annotating degs in cos and lsw <dig>  of the degs identified in cos  and lsw <dig>  from kegg pathway enrichment analysis for genes in different clusters, the top  <dig> pathways were selected according to the ko annotation for all degs involved in fruit ripening in cos or lsw <dig>  fisher’s exact test was used to identify the significance of the pathway in each profile  compared to the whole-transcriptome background. the p values were converted to -log <dig> and are presented in a heat map. deeper color represents a higher degree of pathway enrichment




an integrative analysis of degs during fruit ripening revealed the key pathways involved in the ripening of cultivated watermelon fruit
to reveal the key pathways involved in the ripening of cultivated watermelon fruit, we compared the degs from four cultivars: cos  and lsw <dig>  in this study and dumara  and  <dig>  in previous studies  <cit> . we found that  <dig> degs overlapped  and used these as fruit-ripening-responsive genes to identify the key pathways during fruit ripening while avoiding the genotype × environment effect, which exhibits variations in different watermelon cultivars. a total of  <dig> degs during fruit ripening in the wild species pi296341-fr were used to represent key genes involved in fruit ripening. go categories were assigned to these groups of  <dig> and  <dig> degs. figure  <dig> shows the assigning of go terms according to the equivalent biological process, molecular role and cellular component. we noted that more degs were significantly enriched in the categories of transferase activity  and catabolic activity  in the cultivars than in the wild species. a kegg analysis assigned the degs from the cultivars and wild species to  <dig> and  <dig> metabolic pathways, respectively. the entire list of metabolic pathways is provided in additional file  <dig>  the top  <dig> significantly enriched ko pathways in the cultivars sorted by p value  and their corresponding enrichment in the wild species are presented in table  <dig>  interestingly,  <dig> degs were significantly enriched in  <dig> ko pathways , namely phenylpropanoid biosynthesis , galactose metabolism , other glycan degradation , carotenoid biosynthesis , arginine biosynthesis , monobactam biosynthesis , brassinosteroid biosynthesis , pentose and glucuronate interconversions , plant hormone signal transduction , and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism  . however, compared with the cultivars, the  <dig> degs in the wild species were less significantly enriched in these pathways, with the exception of arginine biosynthesis and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism . interestingly, four of the ten metabolic pathways were annotated to relate to sugar metabolism and cell wall metabolism, including galactose metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, other glycan degradation, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, but none of these was significant during fruit ripening in the wild watermelon species. these differences might suggest that with the domestication and improvement of wild watermelon species, watermelon fruit flesh with a high utilization ratio of carbohydrates, stronger sugar-mediated signaling, and greater sucrose accumulation would be selected by humans  <cit> , which would increase the soluble sugar content and improve the appearance of the fruit flesh. in addition, we noted that carotenoid accumulation  in the wild species was also significantly enriched in degs, suggesting that carotenoid biosynthesis is more important than other metabolic pathways in watermelon fruit flesh ripening.fig.  <dig> comparison of the degs detected in four watermelon cultivars  during fruit ripening

degs in carotenoid biosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction, and sugar and cell wall metabolism during the ripening of cos and lsw <dig> fruit
the numbers of degs involved in carotenoid biosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction, sugar metabolism and cell wall metabolism during fruit ripening are listed in table  <dig>  a total of nine degs in lsw <dig> were associated with the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, and seven of these, which encoded phytoene synthase , ζ-carotene isomerase , ζ-carotene desaturase , β-carotene 3-hydroxylase , and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase , were clustered into profile  <dig>  profile  <dig> or profile  <dig>  showing upregulated trends. only cla <dig> encoding psy was downregulated . in contrast, of the six degs in cos, only three, encoding psy , chyb , and nced , were upregulated , two showed biphasic expression patterns , and one was downregulated . these degs encoded ζ-ring hydroxylase  and nced . some of the degs involved in plant hormone formation and signal transduction, particularly the biosynthesis and signal transduction of aba and ethylene, displayed a different expression pattern ; for example, the expression of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase  and serine/threonine-protein kinase  in cos peaked during fruit ripening, whereas the expression of aba 8-hydroxydase , xanthoxin dehydrogenase , abscisic acid receptor pyr/pyl family , and ethylene receptor  in cos decreased during fruit ripening, and that of ethylene-responsive tf  in cos showed a biphasic expression pattern. the expression of an aba 8’-hydroxylase  and two pyr/pyls  in lsw <dig> increased during fruit ripening, whereas the expression of aba <dig> , an aba 8’-hydroxylase, a pyr/pyl , an snrk , and an etr  in lsw <dig> decreased during fruit ripening. several of the degs involved in sugar metabolism and cell wall metabolism, involving genes encoding two α-galactosidases , five raffinose synthases , three sucrose synthases , two sucrose-phosphate synthases , two insoluble acid invertases , udp-sugar pyrophosphorylase , two sugar transporters , three α- <dig> -galacturonosyltransferases , nine pectinesterases , α-mannosidase , endoglucanase , and eight β-glucosidases , also underwent major modifications during fruit ripening . notably, the two insoluble acid invertases were downregulated in both cultivars, α-mannosidase and two sugar transporters were upregulated in both cultivars, and the expression patterns of the other degs in cos and lsw <dig> presented differences.table  <dig> list of some of the important differentially expressed genes between the different ripening stages in cos and lsw177

analysis of tfs involved in watermelon fruit development and ripening
by modulating gene transcription at precise times and during distinct processes, tfs are activated upon wounding, physiological illnesses and internal or external stimulation  <cit> . to determine which tf families play vital roles in the development and maturation of watermelon fruit, the degs in cos and lsw <dig> were annotated and classified as tfs using planttfcat  <cit> . from these degs,  <dig> tfs in cos and  <dig> tfs in lsw <dig> were identified . in general,  <dig> non-overlapping putative tfs were further classified into  <dig> tf families that were present in the planttfcat database . of these differentially expressed tfs, ap2-erfbp, bhlh, c2h <dig>  and myb-hb-like were the most abundant in the two cultivars and have been identified and implicated in many diverse functions described in this database, including hormone signal transduction, cell proliferation, protein-protein interactions, anthocyanin biosynthesis, and fruit dehiscence, which are involved in the development and ripening of fruit in normal or reverse form.fig.  <dig> characterization of the transcription factors of the degs during fruit ripening. distribution of differentially expressed tf families between cos and lsw177




discussion
fruit ripening is a broadly used, genetic and irreversible process that contributes to a chain of physiological, biochemical and sensory changes that result in the development of soft, mature, high-quality fruits  <cit> . rna-seq technology was used to reveal the key roles of metabolic pathways during the ripening of cultivated watermelon fruit and to explore the transcriptomic differences between two contrasting cultivated watermelon genotypes. a total of  <dig> degs in cos and  <dig> degs in lsw <dig> were identified to reveal a group of genes that contribute to the development and maturation of these two watermelon cultivars. in addition,  <dig> degs in four watermelon cultivars during fruit ripening were identified through an integrative transcriptome analysis. based on a gene functional enrichment analysis, these degs were combined with public data and isolated to identify the most important pathways involved in fruit ripening. in addition to the extensively enriched pathways in cos and lsw <dig>  some degs were found to be involved in carotenoid formation, plant hormone signal transduction, sugar metabolism and cell wall metabolism and might have unique functions in cultivated watermelon during fruit ripening. these metabolic pathways are also important for fruit ripening in melon  <cit> , tomato  <cit>  and orange  <cit> . these pathways have the ability to create an organized metabolic association that possibly cooperates during fruit ripening in cultivated watermelon. several of the regulated genes in these pathways are included in fig.  <dig>  the obtained evidence provides a detailed picture of the regulatory complex that contributes to the ripening of cultivated watermelon fruit and reveals transcriptomic differences between cos and lsw <dig> fruits.fig.  <dig> some of the biological pathways involved in watermelon fruit ripening. red boxes indicate genes that are upregulated in lsw <dig> compared to cos, green boxes indicate genes that are downregulated in lsw <dig> compared to cos, and blue boxes indicate genes that exhibit mixed expression patterns  in lsw <dig> compared to cos




carotenoids are a diverse group of colorful tints that occur naturally and are fundamental in plants, where they play a pivotal role regarding human nutrition and health benefits  <cit> . carotenoid formation is monitored throughout the lifespan of a plant and changes according to developmental necessity and in response to external environmental stimuli. the carotenoid formation pathway initiates with the synthesis of phytoene via geranylgeranyl diphosphate  in the innermost isoprenoid pathway. phytoene is further metabolized through desaturations, cyclizations and hydroxylations to yield various products, such as lycopene, carotenes and xanthophylls, through a sequence of tandem reactions. the most important carotenoid accumulated in red-flesh watermelon is lycopene, and its typical level is approximately 60%, which is more than that found in tomato fruit  <cit> . the predominant carotenoids in canary-yellow and pale-yellow phenotypes is zeaxanthin, neoxanthin, violaxanthin and neochrome  <cit> . there is a variety of strategies for organizing carotenoid biosynthesis and accumulation in plant tissues  <cit> ; environmental signaling, plastid compartment size, and post-transcriptional regulation control carotenoid formation and accumulation, but the transcriptional regulation of carotenoid gene expression is considered a key mechanism through which the biosynthesis of peculiar carotenoids is organized during fruit ripening and flower color formation  <cit> . the accumulation of phytoene is a concentration-limiting step in carotenogenesis, and psy is commonly considered the prominent regulatory enzyme in this pathway. in this study, two orthologs of psy, cla <dig> and cla <dig>  were found to be differentially expressed during fruit ripening in lsw <dig>  whereas only cla <dig> was found to be differentially expressed during fruit ripening in cos. the expression level of cla <dig> in the two cultivars was low at ten dap but rapidly peaked at  <dig> dap in both cultivars, and the level in the red-flesh lsw <dig> was significantly higher than that in cos from  <dig> to  <dig> dap during fruit ripening. this gene is upregulated in different red-flesh watermelon accessions, and its expression is significantly higher in these than in non-red-flesh watermelon during fruit ripening  <cit> . in yellow-flesh tomato fruits, abnormal transcripts of psy <dig> and the loss of function of the enzyme result in a significantly reduced level of phytoene and a very low level of colored carotenoids. the psy transcript abundance has been associated with improved carotenoid instability in the roots of maize  <cit> . it has been suggested that cla <dig> is the clapsy <dig> that is mainly responsible for carotenoid synthesis in watermelon fruit. although pds might play a concentration-limiting role in the generation of  <dig> ,90-tri-cis-ζ-carotene  <cit>  and the gene expression levels of zds, lcy, ipi, ggps and psy are affected in the pds <dig> mutant of arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , we did not find any differentially expressed pds-homologous genes between the two cultivars or during fruit development and ripening. zds and z-iso play important regulatory roles in the catalysis of ζ-carotene, the product of pds, to tetra-cis-lycopene, the substrate for crtiso. in this study, zds and z-iso were found to be differentially expressed between cos and lsw <dig> and were upregulated during fruit ripening in lsw <dig>  in contrast, the expression of these genes in cos was nearly unchanged during fruit ripening and significantly lower than that in lsw <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig> dap. the cyclization of lycopene is a key node of this pathway that produces β-carotene and α-carotene from lycopene by lcyb and lcye, respectively  <cit> . in this study, these two genes were found to be expressed similarly in the two cultivars and during fruit ripening, and the same results were found by rna-seq for  <dig> and dumara  <cit> . two previous quantitative studies used real-time pcr to study the lcyb expression level in different watermelon varieties. one study showed that low transcript levels of lcyb caused lycopene to accumulate in ‘cn62’ with pink flesh, and no significant differences in lcyb expression were detected between red-flesh “cn66” and yellow-flesh “zxg381”  <cit> . another study found no differential expression of lcyb between red - and canary-yellow -fleshed watermelon cultivars  <cit> . the continuously low expression level of lcyb and lcye from the early to the mature stage was likely the main reason that the newly biosynthesized lycopene in lsw <dig> could not be further catalyzed to synthesize β-carotene or α-carotene and was gradually deposited in the vacuole to form red flesh. in our previous research, the red-flesh trait in the f <dig> and f <dig> population from cos × lsw <dig> was located in lg4; interestingly, lcyb was located between the two cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence  markers wii04e07- <dig> and wii04e07- <dig>  which were tightly linked to the red-flesh trait, with r2 =  <dig> %  <cit> . in the lcyb-coding/promoter regions, a very small amount of activity of the lcyb enzyme induced by snps or indel likely results in lycopene accumulation . furthermore, we performed a selective sweep of the lcyb gene sequence of  <dig> watermelon accessions  collected from the whole-genome sequence of watermelon  <cit> , and the values of pi, θ, and tajima’s d in a population of wild and semi-wild watermelon were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively, whereas these values in a population of cultivated watermelon were significantly decreased to  <dig> ,  <dig> , and - <dig> , respectively, suggesting that the genetic diversity of the lcyb gene decreased during watermelon evolution. these results suggest that lcyb might be a genetic determinant for lycopene accumulation in watermelon fruit. the chyb and zep genes are involved in violaxanthin formation and lutein accumulation, respectively, and two orthologs of chyb were found to be upregulated during fruit ripening in both cultivars. the same pattern was found in dumara  <cit> ,  <dig>   <cit> , cn <dig>  cn <dig>  zxg <dig>  and zxg <dig>  the expression of two chyb genes in cos was higher than that in lsw <dig> during fruit ripening, whereas the expression in lsw <dig> was significantly higher than that in cos at the over-ripening stage. however, the expression of the two genes was markedly lower in the fruit mesocarp of cultivated watermelon and in the fruit flesh of wild watermelon  <cit> . zep expression was upregulated only in lsw <dig> but was lower and stable during fruit ripening in cos. in the yellow-flesh cultivated watermelon “zxg381”, the transcript variations in zep and chyb strongly correlated with changes in the violaxanthin and lutein contents during ripening  <cit> . in squash, the upregulation of zep and chyb transcription levels leads to violaxanthin and lutein production  <cit> , respectively. these results suggested that the expression level of chyb and zep might help maintain sustainable carotenes levels in cos. a further analysis and exploration of carotenes in cos is required to determine their significant correlation in cos. nced is also involved in the catabolic pathway, which converts 9-cis-violaxanthin or 9-cis-neoxanthin to xanthoxin, an ancestor of aba that is important for non-climatic fruit ripening  <cit> . nced genes were found to be differentially expressed during fruit ripening in both cultivars; nced <dig> showed mixed expression patterns, and nced <dig> expression was downregulated during fruit development. these genes did not present differences in expression between the two cultivars. the expression of only nced <dig> was upregulated in both cultivars during fruit growth, and the expression level of nced <dig> in cos was markedly lower than that in the corresponding lsw <dig> flesh tissues at the late stage of fruit ripening. in addition, the expression of psy <dig>  z-iso, and crtiso is directly regulated by the ripening inhibitor  protein, which is a main member of the mads-box family of tfs  <cit> . in this study, three and five mads-box tfs in cos and lsw <dig> were differentially expressed, respectively. one gene, cla <dig>  is associated with lerin-mads in tomato. the identification of watermelon lerin-mads homolog genes, which present expression peaks throughout the maturation process in both cultivars, strongly supports this hypothesis. an additional member of the ap2/erf superfamily, slerf <dig>  was recently found to play an essential role in tomato fruit ripening and carotenoid accumulation by acting as a negative regulator of two predominant nutritional compounds of tomato . one watermelon gene  is similar to slerf <dig> and is downregulated during fruit ripening in both cultivars. our comprehensive comparative expression analysis of genes involved in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway between cos and lsw <dig> suggests that carotenoid accumulation and consumption in cultivated watermelon are significantly correlated with the key genes and tfs of this pathway.

plant hormones play major roles in fruit development and  ripening  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> genes were found to be involved in plant hormone metabolism:  <dig> genes in aba formation and signal transduction, and three genes in ethylene metabolism. many studies have investigated the molecular mechanisms of fruit ripening in climacteric fruits. the investigation of maturation-defect mutant tomatoes has provided a significant amount of information, and ethylene has been identified as a significant phytohormone in climacteric fruits  <cit> . most studies of the ripening mechanism have been performed in non-climacteric fruits instead of climacteric fruits. watermelon, a non-climacteric fruit, also produces ethylene but only at a trace level, although aba accumulation occurs rapidly during ripening, which indicates that aba might be involved in the regulation of watermelon maturation and senescence  <cit> . aba synthesis and degradation regulate the aba level in plants. aba biosynthesis occurs downstream of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway. nced and aba <dig> are the key concentration-limiting steps in aba biosynthesis, and the aba 8’-hydroxylase gene is essential for the catabolism of aba  <cit> . in this study, the upregulated expression of nced <dig> genes in cos and lsw <dig> was found to aid the shift from carotenoid metabolism to aba metabolism during fruit development depending on the increase in aba content during watermelon fruit growth and ripening, which as previously mentioned  <cit> , might be the main driver of cultivated watermelon maturation. the nced gene also plays a primary function in the biosynthesis of aba during fruit maturation  <cit>  in tomato  <cit>  and melon  <cit> . thus, nced might be a noteworthy regulator of the ripening phase in cultivated watermelon. the expression of an ortholog of aba 8’-hydroxylase, cla <dig>  was relatively low at the early stage, increased rapidly with fruit ripening, and peaked at  <dig> dap in both cultivars, and its expression in cos was higher than that in lsw <dig> during fruit ripening. these results suggest that the internal aba content differs between the two cultivars. the biosynthesis and catabolism of aba are regulated by bg genes during ripening and development  <cit> . in this study, eight orthologs of bg were found to be differentially expressed during ripening in both cultivars; two of them were upregulated, and the others were downregulated or showed a biphasic expression pattern in both cultivars. a previous study showed that clbgs with differential expression patterns in watermelon appear to have overlapping functions in aba catabolism during watermelon ripening  <cit> . however, the expression of bg remained at its peak from the coloration step to fruit ripening to regulate the levels of aba during melon and grape ripening  <cit> , which indicates that bg has an important complex function during watermelon ripening. however, the precise contribution of bg to the aba levels in watermelon fruit requires further study. for aba signal transduction, the preliminary reaction to aba implies the aba-dependent pyr/pyl-mediated inactivation of pp2cs, which permits the release of snrk2s and the phosphorylation of aba-dependent tfs. in our study, pyl/pyl, pp2cs and snrk2s showed differential expression patterns between cos and lsw <dig> during fruit ripening. therefore, the findings of this study indicate that different transcriptional regulatory mechanisms modulate aba reactions during different watermelon fruit ripening stages. ethylene plays a primary role in the ripening of climacteric and non-climacteric watermelon fruits. acs, etr and erf are key genes in the ethylene formation and transduction pathway and were found to be differentially expressed during fruit ripening in cos and/or lsw <dig>  no acs gene was differentially expressed in the flesh of lsw <dig> during watermelon ripening, whereas an ortholog of acs in cos was differentially expressed, although at extremely low levels, during fruit ripening. the expression of acs-homologous genes in watermelon is also low  <cit> , and previous studies have found that the ethylene synthesis rate in watermelon is markedly lower than that in tomato  <cit> , which might at least partly explain the differential expression of the acs gene. ethylene is identified by the receptors  and additional related proteins, and etr functions as a negative regulator of ethylene reactions in tomato  <cit> . in this study, an etr-homologous gene was found to be consistently downregulated in both cultivars and presented a higher expression level in cos compared with that in lsw <dig> at the early phase of fruit ripening. a similar expression trend for an etr-homologous gene was found in the fruit flesh of  <dig>  <cit> . moreover, we used the numerous tfs that were differentially expressed to normalize the behavior of ethylene-biosynthesis-related genes, such as the tfs of the ap2-erfbp and mads-mikc superfamily. the tfs of the ap2-erebp family have either one or two ap <dig> domains, the name of which derives from apetala <dig> protein  <cit> . in tomato, apetala <dig>  influences fruit maturation by regulating ethylene formation and signaling  <cit> . siap2a is synthesized at low levels in flowers and early phases of fruit ripening but is considerably upregulated from the mature green to the breaker stages and is noticeably synthesized during the red-ripe stage. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> ap2-erfbps in cos and lsw <dig>  respectively, were found to be differentially expressed. of these, cla <dig> was significantly upregulated during fruit ripening in both cultivars, and it has been suggested that this tf is an important functional ortholog of slap2a in watermelon, although its role in non-climacteric ripening might be different from that in ethylene regulation.

sugars are crucial components of cultivated watermelon fruit quality  <cit>  and serve as imperative signals in the regulation of fruit ripening  <cit> . as with all other fruits of cucurbits, watermelon sugars consist of sucrose, fructose and glucose  <cit> . the sweetness level of watermelon is determined by calculating the total sugar contents and by determining the composition of glucose, fructose and sucrose  <cit> . at the early stage of ripening, the sucrose content in watermelon is very low but increases at later stages, whereas the fructose and glucose contents remain constant  <cit> . in this study, the tss, fructose and sucrose contents were found to be very low at the early stage of fruit development and increased rapidly at later stages in cos and lsw <dig>  whereas the glucose content peaked in the early stage and then decreased to its initial level during fruit ripening. dumara and  <dig>  exhibited the sugar compositions and the same dynamic changes in the sugar content during fruit ripening  <cit> . the sugar content in watermelon fruit is evaluated by measuring the activities of phloem unloading and metabolism that occur within fruit flesh. stachyose, raffinose and sucrose are the main sugars transported from the leaves to the fruit in the phloem of cucurbit plants  <cit> . furthermore, a considerable amount of translocated sugars undergoes phloem loading, distribution and metabolism, which are controlled by pivotal sugar metabolism enzymes  <cit> . in this study, more differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in pathways related to the biosynthesis/catabolism of stachyose, raffinose and sucrose, such as ‘galactose metabolism’, ‘pentose and glucoronate interconversions’, ‘other glycan degradation’, ‘fructose and mannose metabolism’, ‘glycolysis/gluconeogenesis’, and ‘starch and sucrose metabolism’. several important genes encoding key sugar metabolism enzymes that are involved in these complex metabolic pathways were differentially expressed between cos and lsw <dig>  and these included genes encoding raffinose synthase, α-galactosidase, susy, sps, iai, and udp-sugar pyrophosphorylase . in addition, these genes were also differentially expressed at different ripening phases in cos and lsw <dig>  the raffinose synthase gene is critical for the synthesis of raffinose from galactinol. six raffinose gene orthologs were found to be differentially expressed during fruit ripening in cos and/or lsw177; of these, cla <dig> was consistently and equally upregulated in both cultivars, and its expression level in cos was higher than that in lsw <dig>  the other raffinose gene orthologs were downregulated or showed biphasic expression patterns in cos and lsw <dig>  α-galactosidase is the core enzyme that hydrolyzes stachyose and raffinose and determines the sink strength in all cucurbit plants. an α-galactosidase-homologous gene, cla <dig>  was found to be upregulated during fruit ripening, and its expression peak in cos was higher than that in lsw <dig>  these domino effects indicated that cla <dig> might function as an essential element for phloem unloading and sink strength evaluation during development. previous studies have suggested that the sugars in watermelon are inspected primarily by three enzyme families: susys, spss and invertases  <cit> . susy is a focal enzyme that can catalyze both the formation and hydrolysis of sucrose in plants. a positive correlation between susy activity and fruit sucrose accumulation has also been found in melon  <cit>  and watermelon  <cit> . in this study, the gene expression level of one susy-homologous gene  was found to be upregulated during fruit ripening and presented a noticeable positive correlation with the sucrose content in lsw <dig>  which suggests that this enzyme plays a vital role in evaluating the sugar composition in lsw <dig>  sps is a pivotal enzyme that catalyzes sucrose formation. sps movement is positively related to sucrose accumulation in tomato  <cit> , melon  <cit>  and watermelon  <cit> . one ortholog of sps, cla <dig>  was found to be significantly upregulated in cos during fruit ripening, which suggests that the synthesis and accumulation of sucrose in cos and lsw177are regulated by different genes or mechanisms. in watermelon, sucrose translocation occurs equally with phloem unloading, is related to fruit sinks and requires insoluble acid invertase. three iai-homologous genes were found to be significantly differentially expressed and were consistently downregulated during fruit ripening in cos and/or lsw <dig>  which suggests that the iai activities are negatively correlated with sucrose accumulation during development in cos and lsw <dig>  a noteworthy positive correlation between invertase activity and fruit sucrose accumulation has been reported in sweet watermelon  <cit> , melon  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , and sugar cane  <cit> . in the proposed pathway for galactose metabolism, ups exerts a positive effect on melon fruit sink metabolism  <cit> , and an ortholog of ups, cla <dig>  was found to be steadily upregulated over time in the flesh of the investigated cultivars and exhibited a higher expression level in cos than in lsw <dig> during watermelon fruit development. a gene that exhibited the same trend was identified in  <dig>  but its expression remained relatively constant and was lower in the flesh of pi296341-fr and  <dig> mesocarp, which indicates that the ups gene functions in fruit sugar metabolism in watermelon. two core catalyst superfamily sugar transporters were significantly and equally upregulated in the flesh of the investigated cultivars and had higher expression levels in cos than in lsw <dig> during watermelon fruit development. in contrast, their expression in the mesocarp of  <dig> was greatly inferior to that in the flesh of  <dig> and was almost absent in pi296341-fr flesh tissue. moreover, these transporters were positioned at the flanking region associated with fruit sugar substance and major qtl qbrix2- <dig> on watermelon chromosome  <dig>  in strawberry, the rnai of the sugar transporter could significantly decrease the sucrose content and over-ripening of fruit  <cit> . thus, the results reveal that transporter genes might participate in maximizing the sugar content in fruit flesh by providing the active transmembrane transport of sugars.

cell wall metabolism is one of the most important variables in fruit ripening and is related to flesh texture  <cit> , which is a significant quality attribute because it is directly associated with fruit commercial quality, including mouth feel, fruit durability, transportation and shelf life  <cit> . the fruit cell wall contains mainly pectin, cellulose, and hemicellulose, which form interlaced networks with diverse families of cell-wall-modifying proteins. the degradation of pectin and cellulose depends on multiple plant hormones that affect cell wall catabolism during fruit softening. recent studies have revealed that fruit softening is regulated by a subset of major metabolism genes that contribute to cell wall metabolism during fruit ripening  <cit> , including gaut, pg, pe, bg, pectinesterase inhibitor , polygalacturonase inhibitor , and α-mannosidase  genes. the gaut gene is key for the synthesis of pectin  <cit> , which is the core constituent of the primary cell wall and determines fruit consistency and quality. pectin depolymerization is the main reason for decreased fruit firmness. the enzymes responsible for pectin variation in the fruit cell wall are pe and pg. pe catalyzes the hydrolytic de-esterification of pectin, resulting in pectin chain esterification, and the products are hydrolyzed to pectate by pg to result in tissue softening during ripening. the comparison of cos with lsw <dig> revealed that the pg and gaut genes were upregulated in cos, whereas the pe genes displayed mixed expression patterns. in addition, the action of pectinesterase and polygalacturonase can be synchronized by protein inhibitors  <cit> ; in this study, an pei and an pgi were found to be significantly downregulated during fruit ripening in both cultivars, whereas cos had a lower pei expression level and a higher pgi expression level compared with lsw <dig> at the early phase of ripening. the increasing activity of α-mannosidase has been significantly correlated with fruit softening and ripening during fruit ripening in mango  <cit>  and tomato  <cit> . in this study, an ortholog of mana was found to be significantly upregulated in both cultivars and presented a higher expression level in cos than in lsw <dig>  cellulose is another essential constituent of plant cell walls that provides mechanical support to the plant structure  <cit> . endoglucanase is a key enzyme that catabolizes cellulose in plants. in this study, an ortholog of endoglucanase was found to be significantly upregulated from  <dig> to  <dig> dap during fruit ripening, and its expression level was higher in cos than in lsw <dig>  the above-described results suggest that the genes involved in cell wall metabolism might play critical roles in determining fruit texture, and most of these genes were differentially expressed between red-flesh and yellow-flesh watermelon fruits during ripening.

CONCLUSIONS
due to its non-climacteric behavior, watermelon is a model fruit, although the genes associated with fruit development and ripening remain largely unknown. a comparative transcriptome analysis of two contrasting watermelon genotypes during fruit development and ripening would provide additional information regarding the genetic basis of variations in fruit development. using high-throughput rna-seq, we generated approximately  <dig> million high-quality reads from red-flesh and pale-yellow-flesh cultivated watermelon at the most important stages of fruit development. this dataset provides an accurate transcriptional status of the watermelon growth phase and provides the first gene expression profiles of a pale-yellow-flesh watermelon during development. an investigation of the gene expression profiles noted that many processes associated with watermelon fruit quality  are regulated at the transcriptional level to a great extent. a number of key genes were identified by evaluating watermelon fruit characteristics together with sugar metabolism and transport, carotenoid biosynthesis, and cell wall metabolism. hence, our investigation provides a method for guiding the detection of fundamental genes. regulatory genes with well-ripening-associated functions, such as those involved in the aba, ethylene biosynthesis and signaling pathways, were also identified. the expression patterns of these genes suggest that aba and ethylene might equally contribute to regulating watermelon fruit quality, although watermelon is categorized as a non-climacteric fruit. our comparative transcriptome study provides new genome-wide insights into the molecular-level mechanisms of fruit development and ripening and the regulation of numerous essential fruit quality attributes of watermelon, such as sugar accumulation, flesh color and flesh texture.
