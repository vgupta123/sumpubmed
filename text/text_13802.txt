BACKGROUND
corneal ulcers are one of the most common eye problems in the horse and can cause varying degrees of visual impairment or even blindness  <cit> . secondary infection and protease activity causing melting of the corneal stroma are always concerns for the clinician, even in horses with superficial ulcers. exposure of a corneal ulcer to organisms from both the ocular surface and the environment may result in secondary infection, which combined with infiltrating polymorphonuclear leukocytes, stimulates production and activity of proteolytic enzymes and subsequent corneal melting  <cit> . conventional medical treatment of the melting process involves controlling infection with antibiotics and managing pain. however, antibiotic treatment of equine corneal ulcers can lead to acquired antibiotic resistance and selective propagation of resistant bacteria  <cit> .

the term cross-linking refers to the formation of covalent bonds between long chained molecules. intermolecular cross-linking increases the rigidity of materials and is also a natural part in the normal aging of the corneal stroma  <cit> . corneal cross-linking  is induced by introducing riboflavin  to the cornea and illuminating it with ultraviolet light . riboflavin absorbs uva and visible light, producing reactive oxygen species   <cit> . in the cornea, ros increase the number of covalent bonds among stromal collagen molecules  <cit> , which enhances the biomechanical rigidity of the cornea  <cit> . furthermore, cxl changes molecular structures within the cornea to prevent proteolytic enzymes from binding to specific cleavage sites, decreasing the efficacy of collagen degrading enzymes  <cit> . thus, through increasing biomechanical strength and decreasing proteolysis, cxl has been demonstrated to be effective in cases of keratoconus and melting ulcers in humans  <cit> .

riboflavin has been used for inactivation of pathogens in blood products  <cit> , due to its ability to induce strand cleavage of dna and rna, thus interfering with the replication of pathogenic microorganisms  <cit> . in its application to the cornea, cxl has been documented to exert antimicrobial effects, both in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo  <cit> . the specific mechanisms remain to be elucidated, but it is possible that the increased resistance of collagen to degradative enzymes, as well as a direct antimicrobial effect of ros may be involved  <cit> .

in human eyes, cross-linking of the cornea appears to be a safe procedure. however, two potential risks to the eye from uva exposure have to be considered: direct damage to corneal cells and intraocular structures from uva irradiation, and indirect damage to all regional cells from ros  <cit> . riboflavin limits the potential for direct damage, as it limits radiant transmission to deeper ocular structures by absorbing uva-light. in human, porcine, and rabbit corneas, damage to keratocytes occurs to a depth of  <dig> μm with surface irradiance of  <dig> mw/cm <dig> <cit> , thus it is recommended that cxl only be conducted when corneal thickness exceeds  <dig> μm. this provides a margin of safety that avoids direct damage to the corneal endothelium and intraocular structures  <cit> . the loss of stromal keratocytes in the illuminated area can be accepted, because it is temporary to current knowledge and repopulation occurs during  <dig> months after the uva illumination  <cit> .

since stromal ulcerative keratitis is a common condition in the horse, frequently associated with secondary infection and melting of the stroma, we decided to test whether it was possible to perform cxl in sedated, standing horses. we also wanted to know if equine stromal ulcerative keratitis with and without melting would heal after treatment with a combination of cxl and medical therapy.

RESULTS
all horses were diagnosed with stromal ulcerative keratitis with leukocyte infiltrates surrounding the ulcers . four horses showed clinical signs of corneal melting. microbiological cultures in  <dig> out of  <dig> horses were positive for bacteria or fungi.

f = female , g = gelding, s = stallion, d = days, mo = months, w = weeks, yr = years, 1/3 = anterior third of the cornea, 2/3 = middle third of the cornea, g + =gram-positive, ß-hem = ß-hemolytic, enucl = enucleated, n/a = not applicable. all horses were affected unilaterally. for horse no  <dig>  the number of days to fluorescein negativity is listed for each of the two stromal ulcers respectively.

cxl could be performed in all  <dig> horses. removal of a narrow zone of the surrounding corneal epithelium, instillation of riboflavin eye drops and exposure of the ulcerated area to uva light was well tolerated by the sedated horses. each treatment session, from sedation to completion of the cxl , took approximately two hours. instillation of riboflavin can readily be performed by one person, whereas other parts of the procedure require both a veterinarian and a nurse.

eight of nine eyes treated with cxl combined with topical and systemic medical treatment , healed with light stromal scarring . within  <dig> days, all of these eight eyes showed improvement of clinical signs. the healing process of the stromal ulcers after cxl followed a similar pattern with respect to the reduction of inflammatory signs, including reduced signs of ocular pain, decrease in corneal oedema and ciliary injection and less aqueous flare and inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber. the stromal melting had stopped when re-examined the day after treatment. in 2– <dig> days, a granular appearance of the denuded stromal tissue could be observed and in some cases a rejection of necrotic mucoid tissues followed . ingrowth of blood vessels to the ulcerated area and regeneration of the corneal stroma and re-epithelialization could be observed. eight of nine eyes became fluorescein negative in  <dig>  days  after cxl .

the median healing time with ranges. horse no.  <dig>  which was enucleated, is excluded from the table.

cxl treatment failed in one of the two horses with fungal ulcerative keratitis . this horse, horse no.  <dig>  developed panophthalmitis during  <dig> days after the cxl and the eye was enucleated. histopathology of the eye showed keratomalacia with ulcerations of descemet’s membrane and infiltration of fungal hyphae into the anterior chamber.

in horse no.  <dig>  neither fungal hyphae nor bacteria were observed on cytology four days after cxl. the two stromal ulcers in this horse became fluorescein negative in  <dig> and  <dig> days after cxl, respectively .

horse no.  <dig>  which had streptococcal keratitis, was negative on corneal culture and no bacteria were present on cytology  <dig> days after cxl, despite the lack of topical antimicrobial treatment after cxl .

one patient, horse no.  <dig>  developed purulent conjunctivitis the day after cxl treatment. bacterial culture from the conjunctiva was positive for enterobacter and the conjunctivitis resolved after topical treatment with chloramphenicol.

discussion
cxl could readily be performed in all  <dig> horses under sedation and standing surgery. the procedure is rather time-consuming to perform compared to medical treatment alone, but easy to learn and does not require expertise in microsurgery. however, evaluation of pre- and postoperative results should be performed by a person with proper training in equine ophthalmology. because of the risks associated with general anaesthesia in this species, it is an advantage to be able to perform the treatment on standing horses under sedation. a stable level of sedation and a calm environment are crucial for proper positioning of the uva light on the cornea of the horse throughout the procedure.

the melting process seen in four horses had stopped when re-examined the day after treatment. this is in accordance with the results in a pilot study where cxl was used to treat three cats and two dogs with melting corneal ulcers  <cit> , as well as in human patients  <cit> . cxl is believed to increase the resistance of the cornea to collagen digesting enzymes, because of the structural changes of the collagen fibrils induced by cross-linking  <cit> . in the horse, melting of the corneal stroma is not uncommon in patients with corneal ulcers. frequent instillation of eye drops onto a rapidly melting cornea and painful eye can be rather challenging and certainly time-consuming. the prompt increase in stability of the melting cornea seen in various species suggests that cxl could be beneficial and labour-saving in patients with uncontrolled enzymatic degradation of the corneal stroma.

a few days after cxl we observed that the denuded stroma took on a granular appearance in most eyes. this has not been described in other species and might reflect a phase during the post-cxl wound healing that may be specific to the horse. in three horses this was followed by formation of a tissue layer with mucoid, necrotic appearance that was rejected after approximately 1– <dig> weeks.

corneal ulcers in the horse often require medical treatment for several weeks and sometimes adjunct corneal surgery  <cit> . in our study, the median time from cxl to fluorescein negativity was  <dig> days in horses with positive microbial cultures. ulcerative keratitis caused by streptococci is frequently reported to be refractory to treatment, producing stromal melting. brooks et al. reported an average healing time of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days in horses with streptococci isolated from corneal ulcers and the vast majority of the horses required corneal surgery  <cit> . andrew et al. reported a median duration of treatment of  <dig> days for  <dig> horses with ulcerative keratomycosis  <cit> . in a study by wada and colleagues, the mean healing time was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days in  <dig> horses with positive microbial cultures  <cit> . our median healing time is closer to the median time for re-epithelialization reported in human patients with bacterial keratitis primarily treated with cxl   <cit> . because of the low number of horses in this study and the absence of a control group, we cannot conclude that the healing time after cxl is different from the time to healing in horses treated medically only.

the cxl was unsuccessful in horse number  <dig> with fungal keratitis. light microscopic examination of the globe enucleated four days postoperatively revealed fungal hyphae inside the anterior chamber. at the day of cxl-treatment, but before cxl was performed, this eye showed an aggravation of clinical signs, including hypopyon, pain and miosis. perhaps the fungi in this case had spread intraocularly already before treatment with cxl. it is also possible that the antifungal effect of the cxl was insufficient, as has been indicated by the work of martins et al.  <cit> . because the antimicrobial effect of cxl is restricted to the superficial  <dig> μm using this type of uva light source, it is unlikely that microorganisms dwelling deep in the corneal stroma, would be completely eliminated. consequently, this case shows that the indications for cxl in the horses with stromal ulcerative keratitis need to be carefully considered.

we experienced one patient that developed a purulent conjunctivitis due to enterobacter sp. the day after cxl. enterobacter is known to be an opportunistic species of bacteria not uncommonly isolated from horses with ulcerative keratitis and conjunctivitis  <cit> . it is likely that the manipulation of the eye during the examination or treatment of the ulcer played a role in the development of the bacterial conjunctivitis in this horse, but we do not believe that the exposure to the uva-light or riboflavin eye drops per se caused this problem. hence, measures to reduce the risk for iatrogenic infections should, as always, be taken and careful postoperative monitoring of the outcome is recommended.

potential complications of cxl in patients include loss of endothelial cells due to incomplete absorption of the uva light in the overlying stroma, as well as loss of limbal stem cells after accidental illumination by the uva light. it has been shown experimentally that cxl of thin corneas or of corneas with insufficient concentration of riboflavin, for instance due to too short exposure to the riboflavin eye drops to allow sufficient absorption, can cause endothelial cell damage  <cit> . the normal equine cornea is  <dig> — <dig>  mm thick  <cit> , therefore, with exception of very deep corneal ulcers, the risk for endothelial damage is judged to be low. to reduce the risk for uncontrolled uv damage to the cornea, we used a light source with an emission spectrum coinciding with the peak absorption of riboflavin in the uva-part of the spectrum   <cit> , an optical system providing a rather constant beam intensity across the area illuminated to prevent hot spots and a shutter that allows light-exposure of a well defined area of tissue to avoid incidental damage to limbal stem cells. furthermore, the radiant exposure and the irradiance used were below the threshold for damaging the human eye by uva  <cit> .

makdoumi et al., who treated human patients with mainly infectious, ulcerative keratitis, a patient cohort rather similar to our horses, observed no complications that could be attributed to cxl up to  <dig> months after treatment  <cit> . we have not observed chronic corneal oedema, which would have been a clinical sign of endothelial decompensation, during the follow up period up to  <dig> months. furthermore, light corneal scarring has been reported in a low number of patients with keratoconus treated with cxl  <cit> . postoperative scarring was present but limited in the  <dig> horses where cxl was successful in this study and all these horses retained useful vision. bearing the pre-operative appearance of these corneas, we were impressed with the corneal transparency months after cxl, but again it is not possible to judge whether the cxl treatment has affected the amount of scarring seen postoperatively. however, corneal scarring is considered a problem in equine infectious keratitis no matter whether surgery is performed or not  <cit> .

in summary, vision-threatening complications directly associated with the procedure were not observed in this pilot study. we believe that further studies on cxl in this species are warranted.

CONCLUSIONS
cxl-treatment was readily performed in  <dig> sedated, standing horses. the median duration from cxl to fluorescein negativity was  <dig>  days in the  <dig> horses where the corneal ulcers healed. stromal melting seen in  <dig> horses stopped within  <dig> h after cxl. postoperative corneal scarring was subjectively judged to be light, but comparison to similar ulcers only treated medically was not available. one patient contracted a postoperative, bacterial conjunctivitis and cxl showed no therapeutic effect in one horse. this shows that patients eligible for cxl need to be carefully chosen and monitored postoperatively. we consider cxl potentially useful for treatment of stromal corneal ulcers in the horse, but further research and comparison to conventional medical treatment is needed.
