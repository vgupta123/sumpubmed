BACKGROUND
mps <dig> , a serine/threonine kinase, plays multiple functions in the cell cycle  <cit> . in mitosis, mps <dig> is indispensable for both the spindle assembly checkpoint  and chromosomal alignment. mps <dig> activates sac by directing the assembly of the mitotic checkpoint complex . the resulting complex binds and inactivates apc/c-mediated proteolysis of cyclin b and securin  <cit> . mps <dig> can phosphorylate borealin to regulate chromosomal alignment independently of sac  <cit> . mps <dig> also affects centrosome duplication by collaborating with substrates, including mortalin, centrin  <dig> and vdac <dig>  <cit> . in interphase, mps <dig> interacts with p <dig> and chk <dig> and is involved in dna damage response  <cit> .

the subcellular distribution of mps <dig> correlates with the functions that it performs in the cell cycle. during mitosis, mps <dig> appears on the kinetochore at prophase, stays consistently until metaphase initiation, and then comes off at metaphase upon mitotic entry  <cit> . kinetochore association of mps <dig> is regulated by hec  <dig> and aurora b  <cit> . the timely release of mps <dig> from kinetochore is required for mitotic progression  <cit> . in interphase, mps <dig> resides in the cytoplasm, nuclear envelope and centrosomes  <cit> . translocation of mps <dig> from cytoplasm to nucleus at the g2/m boundary requires two lxxll motifs at the n-terminal  <cit> . the centrosome localization of mps <dig> is required for centrosome duplication  <cit>  and in the case of dna damage, mps <dig> is also recruited to dna damage foci, showing that mps <dig> plays a role in dna damage response  <cit> .

the regulatory mechanism retarding mps <dig> at cytoplasm is unclear so far. in this paper, a putative nuclear export sequence  motif at the n-terminal of mps <dig> was identified and this motif shows a high sequence similarity to the classic nes, exporting egfp out of the nucleus in cases of fusion. unexpectedly, replacing  <dig> isoleucine and  <dig> leucines in this pnes with alanines did not cause constitutive nuclear enrichment of mps <dig>  further studies suggest that the  <dig> amino acid mutation affects mps <dig> nuclear translocation at the g2/m boundary. consistent with this finding, the mps <dig> mutant with  <dig> of the last  <dig> leucines is predominantly cytoplasmic while the other mutants behave as with the  <dig> amino acid mutation. collectively, the observations showed that the pnes sequence at the n-terminal is a functional motif which is sufficient for driving mps <dig> nucleus export during interphase.

methods
dna constructs and stable cell lines generation
retroviral expression vector prex-yfp-mps1-ires-hygro in the prex background has been described previously  <cit> . constructs prex-egfp-ires-hygro, prk5-myc-mps <dig>  pexl-fth-crm <dig>  pgst-4 t-mps <dig>  pexl-fth-crm <dig> were generated in a standard way. to generate prex-pness-egfp-ires-hygro, the coding sequences for the putative ness were achieved by annealing pairs of complementary oligo-nucleotide primers and then they were sub-cloned into the n-terminal of egfp. to introduce the pnes <dig> mutations in mps <dig>  construct prex-yfp-mps1-ires-hygro was subject to a standard quickchange mutagenesis procedure by pcr amplication with pairs of oligos sequentially. primers used in this paper are showed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  all constructs were confirmed by dna sequencing. the procedure for generation of sw <dig> stable cell lines expressing various mps <dig> mutants is described.

protein expression and purification
to prepare protein from e.coli, the construct pqe60-crm <dig> was transformed into bl <dig>  and then induced with  <dig>  mm iptg at 22°c overnight. the cell pellet was washed and suspended in binding buffer , followed by a regular sonication procedure. the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at  <dig>  g for 30 min. the supernatant was then applied to ni-charged chelating-sepharose  and proteins were purified according to the protocol by the manufacturer. to produce the purified proteins from mammalian cells, plasmids were transciently transfected into 293 t cells. after 48 hrs, cells were washed by d-pbs twice and then subject to lysis buffer .then the supernatant was directly applied to ni-charged chelating-sepharose  or co-incubated with c-myc agarose affinity beads for immunoprecipitation  depending on the tag of proteins fused. fusion proteins were quantified by bca assay  and the purity was confirmed by sds-page analysis.

cell synchronization
synchronization of cells at g1/s phase was accomplished by sequential double thymidine and ro <dig> treatment as described by zhang et al.  <cit> . briefly, cells were arrested at g1/s phase by treatment with 2 mm thymidine for 19 h and cells were washed  <dig> times with d-pbs before released into fresh dmem medium for another 16 h. these cells were washed with d-pbs another  <dig> times and then released into dmem medium with cdk <dig> inhibitor ro- <dig> for 12 h. the arrested cells were then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and subjected to immunofluorescence staining.

pulldown assay and western blot analysis
to detect the direct interaction of proteins, equal amount purified proteins were co-incubated in buffer  <dig> ,  <dig>  m nacl,  <dig> % np <dig>  1 mm edta, 1 mm pmsf, 20 mm naf,  <dig>  mm na3vo <dig>  1×protease inhibitors) and rotated for 2 h. then the corresponding beads were added and rotated for another 1 h, the supernatant and beads were collected by centrifugation. the proteins in beads were released by boiling for 10 min in buffer  <dig>  the proteins from supernatant and the boiled beads were resolved in 10% sds-page gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. primary and secondary antibodies were applied sequentially. primary antibodies anti-α gapdh , anti-mps <dig> nt  and anti-6×his tag  were prepared at a 1: <dig> dilution. the blots were developed in super signal westdura  according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

immunofluorescence
cells for immunofluorescence were grown on cover glasses. prior to staining, cells were treated with chemicals as indicated both in duration and doses. cells were washed  <dig> times with d-pbs and fixed for 10 min in d-pbs plus 1% paraformaldehyde. anti-γ-tubulin  and anti-mps <dig> nt  was prepared at a 1: <dig> and 1: <dig> dilutions respectively. the cells were stained with primary antibody for  <dig>  h at room temperature, followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with alexa fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mice secondary antibodies . to stain dna, 50 μg/ml propidium plus rnaase a or  <dig>  μg/ml dapi in d-pbs was used. after staining, the coverglasses were mounted onto pre-cleaned microscope slides with d-pbs containing 50% glycerol and sealed with nail oil. images were acquired on a zeiss lsm  <dig> equipped with a  <dig> × objective lens.

RESULTS
crm <dig> binds to and exports mps <dig> from the nucleus after mitosis
mps <dig> dominantly resides in the cytoplasm and relocates into the nucleus at the g2/m boundary  <cit> . for the first time, it has been found that mps <dig> can be excluded from the nucleus gradually as the nuclear envelope reforms after mitosis . cytoplasmic retardation of endogenous mps <dig> in the colon cancer cell line sw <dig> requires crm <dig>  as treating cells with crm <dig> inhibitor lmb can block mps <dig> nuclear transport . a similar result was also achieved by using stable sw <dig> cells expressing an yfp fused mps <dig> . these findings suggested that cytoplasmic retardation of mps <dig> is due to the crm1-mediated passive exclusion process. to determine that crm <dig> directly regulates mps <dig> translocation, the association of mps <dig> with crm <dig> was examined. 293 t cells were co-transfected with pexl-fth-crm <dig> and prk5-myc-mps <dig> and collected for immuno-precipitation assay after 48 h. as shown in figure 1d, crm <dig> can bind to endogenous mps <dig>  to determine whether mps <dig> can bind to crm <dig> directly, an in vitro interaction of mps <dig> and crm <dig> was examined using purified proteins. gst-tagged mps <dig> was purified from 293 t cells after a pfast-gst-mps <dig> baculovirus infection for 48 h. 6× his-tagged crm <dig> was expressed and purified from e. coli. these  <dig> proteins were incubated with gst beads at room temperature for 2 h, followed by separating the supernatant and beads via centrifugation. beads were washed 3× and the proteins on beads were subject to a western blot analysis. as showed in figure 1e, a physical association of mps <dig> with crm <dig> was observed. a reciprocal interaction was also performed. as shown, his-crm <dig> can interact with a non-tag mps <dig> . based on these findings, it was concluded that crm <dig> binds mps <dig> and may affect the nuclear export of mps <dig> directly.figure  <dig>

mps <dig> bears a putative nuclear export sequence
crm <dig> carries its cargo proteins through binding to a nuclear export sequence. given the direct interaction of mps <dig> and crm <dig>  it was speculated that mps <dig> bears the nuclear export sequence. to uncover the putative nes, the mps <dig> protein sequence was analyzed via  <dig> online software programs netnes  and elm . as shown in figure 2a, only  <dig> putative nes was revealed in both elm and netnes. to validate these prediction sequences, these putative nes sequences were fused to the n-terminal of enhanced-green fluorescence protein  and the distribution of the resulted fusion protein was examined after a transient transfection of 293 t cells. only the pnes <dig> fused egfp resided in the cytoplasm while the other  <dig> pnes fusion proteins showed a similar distribution pattern as that of the egfp. the cytoplasmic distribution of pnes1-egfp appears to rely on crm <dig>  as the treatment of cells with lmb caused the nuclear enrichment of pnes1-fused egfp . the pnes <dig> seemed to be a classic nes sequence as the leucines enriched pattern is conserved when aligned to the classic nes sequence of cyclin b <dig>  hiv rev and mapk . notably, replacement of these conserved leucines with alanine caused re-localization of egfp into the nucleus . based on these findings, it is thought that pnes <dig> in mps <dig> is a functional nes.figure  <dig>

mps <dig> with all leucines substituted in pnes <dig> reside in the cytoplasm
to further validate that pnes <dig> is a functional nes, the subcellular distribution of mps <dig> mutants, in which  <dig> isoleucine and  <dig> leucines were replaced with alanines  was determined. the resulted fusion protein yfpmps1mutnes <dig> was forcibly expressed in 293 t cells and the subcellular distribution was examined under the indications as shown . unexpectedly, the mps1mutnes <dig> did not reside in the nucleus, even in the presence of lmb , suggesting that pnes <dig> may be not sufficient for nuclear export, or that this mutation may affect both the nuclear import and export of mps <dig> in interphase.figure  <dig>

mps <dig> with one leucine substituted in pnes <dig> relocate to the nucleus
mps <dig> moves from the cytosol to the nucleus at the g2/m boundary prior to the nuclear envelope breakdown  and this process depends on  <dig> lxxll motifs which contribute to the partial tetratricopeptide repeat domain  in the n-terminus of mps <dig> <cit> . given that the pnes <dig> is adjacent to the tpr domain , it was proposed that the mutation of pnes <dig> may alter the conformation of these peptides adjacent to the lxxll motifs. in this case, the mps1mutpnes <dig> would fail to get into the nucleus at the g2/m boundary. to test this theory, it was observed that the distribution of yfp fused mps <dig> and mps1mutnes <dig> was expressed constantly in sw <dig> and was arrested at the g <dig> phase by sequentially treating cells with thymidine and cdk <dig> inhibitor ro- <dig>  consistent with the previous report  <cit> , the mps <dig> mutant loss of  <dig> lxxll motifs in the a domain  failed to get into the nucleus at late g <dig> phase as compared with mps <dig>  as a control, the nonphosphorylation mimics of mps <dig> at s <dig> , which is phosphorylated by map kinase, was translocated into the nucleus at the g2/m boundary  <cit> . interestingly, mps1mutnes <dig> showed an impaired nuclear localization , showing that all leucine substitutions affect the nuclear localization of mps <dig>  in contrast, mps1mutnes <dig> localized to the centrosome as efficiently as wild type mps <dig> , suggesting the nuclear entry inefficiency is not due to the misfolding of the n-terminal. to examine the amino acids essential for mps <dig> nuclear export, yfp fused mps <dig> mutants with only  <dig> mutated leucine were generated and evaluated for the efficiency of nuclear entry. notably, these mutants show the diverse localization pattern: mutation  <dig> of the forward isoleucine  or leucine  predominantly resides in cytoplasm while the mutants with  <dig> of the last  <dig> leucines replaced  show an apparent nuclear localization . similar result was obtained when sw <dig> cells expressing these mutants were arrested at the late g <dig> phase by using cdk <dig> inhibitor ro- <dig> . these findings suggest the pnes <dig> is a functional nuclear export sequence and mutation of the pnes <dig> sequences affect the overall structure integrity of mps <dig> and thereby the distribution in interphase.figure  <dig>

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
mps <dig> predominantly resides in cytoplasm during interphase and then translocates into the nucleus at the g2/m boundary  <cit> . these observations reveal another mps <dig> translocation process in interphase. upon completion of mitosis, mps <dig> was gradually excluded from the nucleus, mediated by mps1/crm <dig> interaction. furthermore, a putative nes motif at the n-terminal of mps <dig> was identified. fusion of this motif with egfp causes the latter to be restrained in the cytoplasm. in addition, it was found that substitution of  <dig> leucine is sufficient to relocate the mps <dig> into the nucleus although the complete substitution of leucine actually hampers this effect. this nes, however, seems to be not the only mediator for mps <dig> export after mitosis as not all mps <dig> accumulate in the nucleus, suggesting that another layer of regulation mechanisms is also involved in this process. tp <dig> is an attractive candidate- this can bind mps <dig> in cases of dna damage response  <cit> . nuclear export of tp <dig> is mediated by mdm <dig> which bears a classic nes  <cit> . as a result, a straightforward hypothesis is that mps <dig> may be exported into cytoplasm by interacting with other proteins, such as tp <dig> 

the n-terminal of mps <dig> is essential several versatile roles, including kinetochore localization, protein instability and nuclear translocation  <cit> . recently, the crystal structure of the mps <dig> n-terminus was solved independently by  <dig> groups  <cit> . the mps <dig> n-terminal is characterized with a tetratricopeptide repeat  domain, followed by the pnes <dig>  due to lxxll motifs being protein-protein interaction domains but not classic nuclear localization sequences  <cit> , it is speculated that the disruption of pnes <dig> may affect the nuclear import of mps <dig> in interphase. consistent with this hypothesis, the nuclear translocation of mps1mutnes <dig> is impaired at the g2/m boundary, showing that the disruption of pnes <dig> integrity also affects mps <dig> nuclear translocation. it is noted that the pnes <dig> sequence of mps <dig> is not orthologically conserved among human, mouse, frog and zebrafish .it is speculated that beside pnes <dig>  other unidentified sequence elements are involved in cytoplasmic restraint of mps <dig> in interphase.

the results reveal that mps <dig> is a novel target for crm <dig>  nevertheless, the function underlying the association of mps <dig> with crm <dig> has been unclear so far. as well as mps <dig>  crm <dig> also regulates the subcellular distribution of several other mitotic regulators in interphase, including cyclin b, aurora b and aurora a  <cit> . these substrates are crucial for several aspects of mitosis, including mitotic spindle formation, nuclear envelope breakdown, chromosomal alignment and sac generation. crm <dig> is also an active mitotic regulator: including the recruitment of mad <dig> to the kinetochore, promotion of spindle assembly and regulation of mitotic progression and chromosome segregation  <cit> . recently, it was found that crm <dig> may also regulate mitotic progression via mps <dig> as lmb treatment can promote kinetochore recruitment of mps <dig> through mitosis . collectively, the results here add new regulatory roles of crm <dig> in mps <dig> translocation during interphase.
