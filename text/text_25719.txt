BACKGROUND
bisphenols represent a group of industrial chemicals, widely and abundantly used for the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. the most common bisphenol, bisphenol a  is used in the manufacture of plastic wares, dental resins, food can lining and flame retardants. total annual production of bpa in the world exceeds  <dig>  million metric tons  <cit> . bisphenols may be present in the environment as a result of direct release from manufacturing or processing facilities or release of unreacted monomers. according to the recent ntp report total environmental release of bpa in  <dig> was  <dig> tons  <cit> . bpa is among the most frequent organic wastewater contaminants detected in ground water in the usa  <cit> . in the united states, the median reported bpa concentration in surface waters was  <dig>  μg/l whereas in europe, mean values of  <dig>  μg/l and  <dig>  μg/l were observed in germany and netherlands respectively  <cit> . however, bpa levels found in receiving waters near processing facilities can occasionally reach levels higher than  <dig> μg/l  <cit> . the presence of bpa in fish has been examined by several authors. basheer et al. found that bpa residues in the fish decapterus russelli from singapore averaged  <dig>  ng/g  <cit> . concentrations ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> ng/g in the liver and from  <dig> to  <dig> ng/g in muscle were found in flounder  and bream  respectively. these fish were collected from dutch coastal waters  <cit> .

the highest potential for human exposure to bpa is through products that directly contact food like beverage containers with internal epoxy resin coatings, polycarbonate tableware and feeding bottles. assessment of human bpa exposure by biomonitoring urinary excretion of bpa metabolites in the population gives an estimated average daily exposure of bpa up to  <dig> μg/adult/day and up to  <dig> μg/day in six months old infants . measurements of bpa in serum of adult men and women show mean concentrations of  <dig>  and  <dig>  ng/ml respectively  <cit> . presence of bpa was also reported in maternal and fetal plasma, in placental tissue in humans  <cit>  and in the milk of nursing mothers  <cit> . most disquieting is the concentration of bpa in amniotic fluid that is approximately five-fold higher than levels measured in maternal plasma  <cit> .

several bisphenols have been shown to cause adverse effects in vertebrates, including humans, by interfering with normal endocrine function  <cit>  and are thus classified as endocrine disruptors . the available data on the interactions between bpa and the endocrine systems suggest it could trigger a wide variety of adverse effects in vivo. bpa displays estrogenic activity in a number of experimental systems and thereby has the potential to adversely affect reproductive function and development in humans and wildlife  <cit> . it can bind to and act as a weak agonist on both estrogen receptors erα and erβ with affinity constants of  <dig>  and  <dig> μm respectively  <cit>  but can also be an antagonist in some type of cells via erα  <cit> . thus, it is defined as a selective er modulator  <cit> . in addition, data from recent studies have revealed that low levels of bpa can induce rapid, membrane-initiated effects similar to the non-genomic effects induced by estrogen  <cit> . thus, bpa exposure could result in interference with normal estrogenic signalling at multiple levels and at different developmental stages as well as in the adult. in addition, bpa has been shown to interact with other nuclear receptor systems such as the thyroid hormone  receptors . bpa is a tr antagonist in transient transfection assays in mammalian cells and bpa exposure of rats during pregnancy causes an increase in serum thyroid hormone concentration  <cit> . bpa acts as a tr antagonist in a tail culture assay in xenopus  <cit> . further, bpa inhibits t3-dependent responses in an in vivo xenopus embryo th sensitive gene transcription reporter assay  <cit> . all these data suggest that bpa not only acts on the reproductive system via the estrogen receptors but can exert a wide range of actions through various nuclear receptor targets during development.

little attention has been paid to the effects of bpa during early developmental stages. ramakrishnan and wayne showed that exposure to low levels of bpa accelerated early embryonic development within 24h of exposure, attenuated body growth and advanced the times of hatching and reproductive maturation in medaka fish . it was also shown that high dose of bpa exposure led to zebrafish embryo mortality while sub-lethal doses led to no blood flow, cardiac edema and tail malformation  <cit> . in the medaka embryo,  <dig> microg bpa/l caused transient embryonic deformities in medaka between days  <dig> and  <dig>  by day  <dig> bpa treated embryos were not different from untreated siblings  <cit> .

this lack of focus on early development may be due in part to the fact that mammalian embryos are difficult to access experimentally. a few recent papers have used the free-living xenopus laevis embryo to test the effects of bpa at different stages of development  <cit> . in particular, bpa was shown to cause malformations of the head region including the eye  <cit> . we too chose to exploit free-living embryos of xenopus and zebrafish to address the possibility that bpa might affect early development and organogenesis. the advantage of using aquatic embryos is the ease in adding substances to be investigated to the aquarium water and study development following exposure without requiring the injection/dissection of the mother as in mammalian models. furthermore, fish and amphibian embryos offer a unique combination of advantages for studying genetics and developmental biology during vertebrate organogenesis, as they are transparent, thereby allowing non-invasive observation. in addition, the large numbers of embryos per clutch provides large sample numbers. in this paper, we report that bpa exposure during the first days of embryonic life causes abnormalities of the inner ear, both in zebrafish, and in xenopus embryos. the use of radioactive labeled bisphenols allowed us to determine the uptake of bpa and bpf and to estimate the capability of the embryos to biotransform and eliminate these xenobiotics. we found that the bio-concentration factors were  <dig> and  <dig> for bpa and bpf respectively. in addition we demonstrated that bpf but not bpa was metabolized in the zebrafish embryo. we used pharmacological approaches to test whether bpa action was linked to interferences with nuclear receptors such as er and tr and found that bpa is not acting through these receptor systems during inner ear development. in contrast, we observed that the na+/k+ atpase system is required for bpa action. our results thus reveal an unanticipated effect of bpa during vertebrate embryonic development.

methods
fish stocks
breeding zebrafish of the ab-tu and tu wild type strains were reared at  <dig> °c and kept under a 8-hr dark/16-hr light cycle and staged as described  <cit> . all data were also obtained on the konstanz wild type strain with identical results. the development of endogenous pigments was inhibited by exposing embryos to 1-phenyl-2-thiourea  at a final concentration of  <dig>  mm. this ptu treatment was not included in experiments designed to assess the effects of different bispenols on pigmentation.

treatment of zebrafish embryos
embryos  were exposed for  <dig> to  <dig> days to bpa propane, cas no. 80-05-7), at concentrations ranging from 10- <dig> m to 10- <dig> m,  <dig> β-estradiol  , ici  <dig>   , th , iop , ptu  or ouabain   diluted in embryo medium, from a stock solution in ethanol, dmso or distilled water. wild type zebrafish treated by vehicule only were used as negative controls to compare effects on compound-treated zebrafish. embryos  were also exposed for  <dig> to  <dig> days to  <dig> - <dig> m bisphenol f methane),  <dig>  10-5m bisphenol e ethane) and 10- <dig> m bisphenol c - <dig> -dichloroethylene) , diluted in embryo medium, from a 10- <dig> m stock solution in ethanol.

measurement of bpa and bpf uptake and metabolism by zebrafish embryos
-bpa, with a specific activity of  <dig>  gbq.mmol- <dig> and a radio-purity greater than 99% was purchased from moravek biochemicals . -bpf, with a specific activity of  <dig> mbq.mmol- <dig> and a radiopurity higher than 99% was purchased from izotop . zebrafish embryos  were exposed for  <dig> h to  <dig> - <dig> m radiolabeled bpa, as described above. at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h, water  and embryos  were sampled separately for radioactivity measurement. embryos were rinsed twice with e <dig> 1x medium and weighed before analysis. at the end of the experiment, remaining water and embryos were collected separately and stored at -20°c until radio-chromatography analysis. the same experiment was repeated with radiolabeled bpf. the radioactivity present in embryos was measured by liquid scintillation counting with a packard tricarb  <dig> counter after  <dig> min treatment at 60°c by  <dig> ml soluene . radioactivity in water was directly measured by liquid scintillation counting. for all vials, sample quenching was compensated by the use of quench curves and external standardisation. at the end of the experiment, remaining water and embryos were collected separately and stored at -20°c until radio-chromatography analysis. hplc coupled to online radioactivity detection  was used for metabolite profiling. water samples were evaporated to dryness and the residue was dissolved in the hplc mobile phase before analysis. radioactivity was extracted from pooled embryos with acetonitrile. the organic fraction was evaporated to dryness and redissolved in the hplc mobile phase before analysis. hplc conditions were as described by zalko et al.  <cit>  for bpa and by cabaton et al.  <cit>  for bpf. in order to control the stability of tested compounds in the medium, a blank, consisting of  <dig> ml embryo medium and  <dig> - <dig> m radiolabelled bpf or bpa was stored during  <dig> h at  <dig> °c before radio-hplc analysis.

treatment of xenopus embryos
groups of xenopus embryos  at stage nf  <dig>  <cit>  were placed in six well plates with  <dig> embryos per well  and exposed for  <dig> hours to bpa  or solvent . xenopus embryos were left in contact with bpa for  <dig> h without any medium change and then washed and left to develop for another  <dig> h and being examined at stage  <dig>  embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and photographed under either a leica dissecting binocular microscope  or nikon smz-u microscope. .

in situ hybridization immunohistochemistry and photography
whole-mount in situ hybridization of zebrafish embryos was performed as described by  <cit> . immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described  <cit>  using the acetylated tubulin primary antibody . stained embryos were photographed with an axioimager microscope  or an olympus bx <dig> microscope. live embryos were photographed using olympus szx <dig> macroscope. images were processed using the adobe photoshop software.

transient transfections
hela cells were maintained at 37°c in 5% co <dig> in dmem-f <dig> , 5% foetal calf serum .  <dig> hours before transfection, cells were plated in 96-well plates  in dmem-f <dig> , 3% dextran-coated charcoal serum  whithout red phenol. cells were transfected with jet-pei according with the manufacturer's instructions . per well,  <dig> ng of the psg <dig> expression vector for the erα, erβ-a and erβ-b,  <dig> ng of the estrogen-dependentluciferase reporter construct  and  <dig> ng of cmv-β-galactosidase plasmid were transfected.  <dig> hours after transfection, cells were harvested in a lysis buffer  and the luciferase activity was measured with the luciferin solution  on a luminometer. pcmv-βgal was used to normalize the transfection efficiency.

limited proteolysis assay
assays were performed as described in  <cit> . proteins were synthesized in vitro using a tnt coupled reticulocyte lysate system kit  and labeled with  methionine  according to the manufacturer's recommendations. bpa was incubated with the protein at different concentrations . after incubation at room temperature for  <dig> minutes with ligand, receptor proteins were digested at room temperature for  <dig> minutes with trypsin. after this incubation time, buffer was added and incubated the mixture for  <dig> minutes at 100°c. sds-page was performed using a 12% gel. electrophoresis was carried out using a biorad gel apparatus at  <dig> v for  <dig> minutes and the polyacrylamide gel was visualized by autoradiography.

in vivo luciferase assay
we used the transgenic ere-luc fish line described by legler et al.  <cit> . male fish with a weight of  <dig> mg  were exposed for  <dig> hours to one ligand or to a mixture of two ligands in glass aquaria . ligands were dissolved in ethanol at concentrations of 10- <dig> m or 10- <dig> m and titrated to final concentrations not exceeding a solvent concentration of  <dig> %. single fish were anaesthetized  and transferred to an eppendorf tube. then,  <dig> ml of ice cold triton-lysis buffer  was added to each tube following homogenization using a micropestle. after centrifugation the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and extracts were measured in luminometric reporter gene assays carried out in duplicates in a microplate luminometer . light units from extracts of ligand-exposed fish and from non-exposed fish were used to calculate fold inductions.

RESULTS
bpa exposure during early embryogenesis induces abnormalities of the otoliths
zebrafish embryos were treated from  <dig> hours post-fertilization  onwards with concentrations of bpa ranging from  <dig>  μm to  <dig> μm. while exposure to bpa < <dig> μm did not induced phenotypic abnormalities, treatment with higher doses induced otolith malformations . these effects were seen in a small proportion  of embryos at  <dig> μm and increased at higher doses with more than 50% of affected embryos at  <dig> μm bpa. notably,  <dig> μm bpa induced embryonic mortality probably linked to cardiac edema and cessation of blood flow. abnormalities included aggregation of the otoliths, appearance of extra otoliths or their absence . the vast majority of embryos exhibit bilateral aggregation of both anterior and posterior otoliths . in some cases, altered semi-circular canals development was observed, but as this effect was highly variable it was not further characterized. in addition we observed that bpa had a mild effect on decreasing the general embryo pigmentation .

otoliths  are composed of calcium carbonate  and are required for normal balance and gravity sensing. otolith formation requires bringing together organic and inorganic components in time and space. disruption of any of these processes can lead to the formation of missing, ectopic or abnormally shaped otoliths  <cit> . otolith defects in bpa treated embryos have not been reported in earlier studies monitoring bpa defects during vertebrate embryogenesis  <cit> . the bpa-induced phenotype is restricted to the otolith as the general shape of the embryos is not affected even if in high dose treatments we detect cardiac edema and stop of blood flow as previously observed  <cit>  . moreover late bpa exposure, after  <dig> hpf, does not alter anymore the development of the otoliths .

in these types of studies, information on the bioavailability, biotransformation and excretion of the tested chemical are crucial to relate the waterborne exposure levels to the actual internal dose reaching the biological targets. because limited data exist on the fate of bisphenols in fish embryos, we determined the uptake and metabolic profile of bpa and bpf  in zebrafish embryos. to this end,  <dig> zebrafish embryos were incubated in a volume of  <dig> ml of e <dig> 1x medium in presence of  <dig> μm -bpa or  <dig> μm -bpf for  <dig> hours. embryos and medium samples were collected for radioactivity measurements and radio-hplc analysis. as shown in figure 1d, the concentrations of bisphenols measured in embryos at the end of the experiment corresponded to  <dig>  μg bpa equivalent per mg fresh weight and  <dig>  μg bpf equivalent per mg fresh weight, respectively. these values indicate that the concentration of radiolabeled compounds was  <dig> and  <dig> fold higher in embryos than in water, respectively. this result allowed us to estimate that the levels of bpa and bpf accumulating in the embryos were in the order of 10-3m and 5x10-4m, respectively.

radio-hplc profiles obtained from bpa exposed embryos and from the water, exhibited a single radioactive peak, displaying the same retention time as bpa itself . in addition no metabolic products were found in the water, suggesting that at this late stage of development, zebrafish embryos were unable to biotransform bpa. in contrast, bpf was biotransformed by embryos, as shown by the radio-chromatograms obtained for embryos extracts and e <dig> medium samples, respectively . due to the low amount of available material, further investigations on bpf metabolite structures could not be carried out.

we next examined whether bpa exposure had an effect on otic vesicle development in another vertebrate embryo. the xenopus embryo was selected because, like the zebrafish, effects on early development can be easily followed in this transparent, free-living embryo. xenopus embryos were exposed to bpa during early development  for  <dig> hours and examined at stage  <dig>  exposure to either  <dig> μm or  <dig> μm bpa caused a strong dose-dependent reduction in the development of the otoconia  . we also observed a severe reduction of the semi-circular canals, with the presumptive arch of the canals being flattened by increasing doses of bpa .

bpa effect is time and compound-specific
to determine if the timing of bpa action corresponds to that of inner ear organogenesis in zebrafish, two series of experiments were done. first, bpa pulse treatments of different lengths were started at  <dig> hpf and continued until  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> hpf, a time frame covering the main steps of otic vesicle development that are shown on figure 2a <cit> . the morphology of the otoliths was examined at  <dig> hpf. in all cases, exposure to bpa  during these critical periods induced otolith malformation with 100% of the treated embryos displaying otolith aggregates . otolith aggregates were never observed in control embryos . in a second series of experiments, treatment started from  <dig> hpf onwards or at  <dig> h intervals thereafter till  <dig> hpf . again, the otolith morphology was examined at  <dig> hpf. when bpa exposure began prior to or at  <dig> hpf, 100% of the embryos displayed malformed otoliths . when treatment began at  <dig> hpf the proportion of affected embryos decreased to 85% . however, almost no effects  were seen when treatments began at  <dig> hpf . treatments starting after  <dig> hpf did not induce any otolith defect . of note is the fact that phenotype severity  is dependent on time of treatment onset. the earlier the bpa exposure , the stronger the phenotype . according to riley and colleagues  <cit>  and colantonio et al.,  <cit> , otic vesicle formation occurs at 18- <dig>  hpf. thus, our results suggest that bpa acts prior to actual otolith formation per se, potentially acting on determination of cells that will give rise to the otoliths.

to test for the specificity of the observed phenotype, we tested the effects of other bisphenols. zebrafish embryos were exposed to bpc, bpe or bpf. as bpa weakly reduces pigmentation, the effects of each bisphenol were recorded on otolith development and pigmentation . we observed differential effects of each bisphenol on these endpoints with bpe producing the most marked effects on both processes . bpc was least disruptive, affecting neither otolith nor pigmentation. interestingly, we observed that the presence of methyl groups on the central carbon between the two phenols had no effect on the action of the molecule on the otic vesicle . in contrast, the presence of a dichloroethylene group on the central carbon  abrogates the disrupting effects of bisphenol .

taken together these results show that although the phenotypic effects are observed only at high concentrations, they disrupt a precise developmental pathway. indeed, the time dependency and the chemical specificity suggest that this is not a general toxicity effect.

developmental analysis of the bpa-induced otolith phenotype
in order to gain insight into the developmental origin of the phenotype, we compared the expression of several markers of otic vesicle and otolith formation between control and bpa-treated fish. first, we monitored if the phenotype of bpa treatment was linked to a developmental delay using a marker, pax <dig> a, that shows a normal pattern .

next, we checked whether the phenotype implicated a defect in hindbrain patterning as this can occur when specific pathways  are disrupted  <cit> . the expression of egr2a, a marker of rhombomere  <dig> and  <dig> segmentation at  <dig> hpf was thus examined. egr2a expression is not affected , suggesting that hindbrain patterning in the region of the otic vesicle is unaltered by the bpa treatment. we next tested if the antero-posterior or the dorso-ventral patterning of the otic vesicle was affected by bpa treatment. using atonal <dig>  and hmx <dig>  two markers expressed in the anterior part of the otic vesicle at  <dig> hpf, we showed that the antero-posterior patterning is not affected in bpa treated embryos . similarly, dorso-ventral patterning is not altered, as displayed by dlx3b labelling at  <dig> hpf   <cit> . recently, petko and colleagues  <cit>  identified otoconin  <dig>  as essential for normal otolith development during zebrafish embryogenesis. when translation of this gene was abolished, otoliths were smaller in size, altered in shape or absent. to test for possible links between the bpa-induced phenotype and the oc <dig> phenotype, we studied oc <dig> expression in bpa treated embryos at  <dig> hpf. in our hands, oc <dig> is expressed in the ventral portion of the otic epithelium . in bpa-treated embryos a stronger signal of oc <dig> expression is detected . a similar up -regulation of oc <dig> is observed in embryos treated with another bis-phenol leading to otolith malformation, bpe . therefore, we conclude that bpa acts by altering directly or indirectly the expression of genes implicated in otolith development. to better understand the relationship between oc <dig> and bpa action, we injected a published morpholino against the oc <dig> gene  <cit> . the most dominant phenotype observed is a single posterior otolith  with sometimes the presence of  <dig> or  <dig> small otoliths in contact with each other. this finding recalls those of petko and colleagues  <cit> . however, when we treated these oc <dig> morphants with bpa we observed a full bpa phenotype  in the posterior developing otolith . therefore, even in the absence of oc <dig>  bpa exposure can lead to otolith aggregation in a similar fashion to control treated embryos .

we then studied if and how the inner structures of the ear were affected by bpa treatment at later embryonic stages . to this end we analyzed the expression of ugdh  <cit> , aldh1a <dig>  <cit>  and bmp <dig>  <cit> . ugdh is expressed in specific regions of the otic vesicle  while expression persists in the anterior cristae. similarly, aldh1a <dig> expression is decreased in endolymphatic duct and posterior cristae while still expressed in anterior cristae, the cranial epithelial projection and the anterior macula . in contrast, bmp <dig> expression in the anterior lateral and posterior cristae is unaffected . the otic vesicle is highly ciliated and the cilia are important for otolith formation. we thus decided to look at these cilia in bpa treated embryos, but did not detect any difference in number, shape nor size of the cilia of the macula in control embryos and bpa treated embryos . this result correlates well with our in situ results as all markers of the anterior macula are expressed normally in bpa treated embryos .

taken together these data reveal that bpa has a broad effect on the specification of several inner ear territories. the morphological otolith phenotype is therefore only one aspect of the more general action of bpa in this organ .

bpa effects on otolith development are estrogen-independent
bpa is known to act as a partial agonist of estrogen  receptors  in mammalian systems  <cit> . in addition several recent observations suggest that both in mammals and fish estrogen signalling plays a role in hearing suggesting a possible connection with otic vesicle formation  <cit> . we questioned whether bpa is able to bind to the three zebrafish ers  and regulate transcription in transient transfection assays. a limited proteolysis assay was carried out using the three previously cloned receptors, esr <dig>  esr2a and esr2b  <cit>  of which esr <dig> and esr2a are ubiquitously expressed during zebrafish embryogenesis including in the otic vesicle  <cit> . as seen in additional file  <dig>  each of the three ers is protected against trypsin degradation in a dose-dependent manner with both e <dig> and bpa. however, the affinity for e <dig> is three orders of magnitude greater with protection occurring at all e <dig> concentrations above  <dig>  μm, whereas  <dig> μm to  <dig> μm bpa is required to protect from trypsin digestions. we thus conclude that bpa can bind all three ers, albeit at low affinity.

the next question was whether ers could be activated by bpa. transient transfections were done using hela cells, which do not express endogenous ers. these cells were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter gene under the control of consensus estrogen response element  along with an expression vector encoding one or the other of the ers: erα, erβ-a and erβ-b. cells were exposed to either increasing concentrations of e <dig> or bpa . we found that luciferase expression was induced in the presence of e <dig> and bpa, but that the ed <dig> for e <dig> was around  <dig> nm or  <dig>  μm dependent on which of the er was used, whereas the ed <dig> for bpa on each er was  <dig> to  <dig> times higher  this result corroborates the results of the limited proteolysis assay described previously. thus bpa binds and activates the three zebrafish ers in the micromolar range.

to verify that bpa elicits a transcriptional response in vivo we used a transgenic reporter zebrafish line that contains a luciferase gene under the control of an ere linked to a minimal promoter   <cit> . we performed this assay in juvenile fish  since, in our hands, e <dig> did not induce a detectable luciferase response using these transgenic fish during embryonic stages  <cit> . the transgenic ere-luc fish were treated with bpa at  <dig> μm. the luc activity was then measured from pooled pairs of juveniles. in presence of  <dig> μm e <dig>  we observed a  <dig> fold induction of luc activity, whereas, as expected, ici  <dig>  , does not induce any activation and completely abolishes e <dig> induced activity. in presence of  <dig> μm bpa, luc activity is weakly induced , but no induction is detected when co-treated with  <dig> μm of ici, clearly suggesting that this effect is er-dependent. these results show that bpa can weakly activate the estrogen pathway in vivo.

we next examined if the otolith phenotype was linked to an alteration of the estrogen signalling pathway. a first approach was to test whether the er agonist, e <dig>  or the er antagonist, ici, modified bpa effects on otolith morphology . zebrafish embryos were exposed to bpa with or without either  <dig> μm e <dig> or  <dig> μm ici. as shown in figure 4a and b, neither ici nor e <dig> treatment alone induced phenotypic alteration of the otoliths . however, whereas e <dig> had absolutely no effect on bpa-induced phenotype in terms of morphology or frequency, ici exhibited a certain level of synergy with bpa, since there were consistently more affected embryos after co-treatment than with bpa alone . however, in this case the severity of the morphological phenotype was unaltered. taken together, these results indicate that the bpa action on otic vesicle development is not mediated primarily by ers but that, to some extent, modulation of ers may alter the frequency of the bpa-induced effect.

the bpa-induced otolith phenotype is tr-independent
bpa has been shown to be a tr antagonist in mammalian cells  <cit>  and tr knock-out mice have a hearing defect linked to abnormalities of ear development  <cit> . more recently in vivo work demonstrated that bpa inhibits t <dig> signalling in xenopus embryos  <cit>  and prevents metamorphosis in xenopus tadpoles  <cit> . as for the zfers, we tested if zftrs could be activated or inhibited by bpa. these data show that bpa was inactive on zftraa being unable to induce the activation of the receptor or to inhibit its activity in presence of low amount of t <dig> .

to test the effect of bpa on the th signaling pathway, we used a pharmacological approach to assess whether bpa action on zebrafish otolith implicated th signalling. we first observed that treatment with high doses of t <dig>  did not induce any obvious morphological abnormalities of the otoliths . in order to prevent the rapid degradation of exogenous t <dig> by endogenous deiodinases, the experiment was repeated in the presence of two compounds that inhibit deiodinase activity, either iodopropanoic acid  or ptu  <cit> . similar results were obtained with or without these agents. treatment of  <dig> embryos with bpa  <dig> μm alone or bpa + t <dig> gave similar phenotypes  and frequencies . to carry out a more sensitive assessment of potential interactions between the two pathways, embryos were treated with suboptimal doses of bpa  and monitored to see if  <dig> μm t <dig> acted synergistically with bpa on the otolith phenotype. as found previously, co-treatment with t <dig> had no effect . these data suggest that there are no interactions, neither positive nor negative between bpa target and th signalling.

bpa and ouabain-induced otolith formation
one of the main enzymes involved in ion exchange and various aspects of inner ear formation are the ouabain sensitive na+/k+ atpases  <cit> . addition of ouabain to embryos was used to examine whether the effects of bpa implicated na+/k+ atpases. ouabain exposure  caused aberrant development of otoliths, with either complete absence  or one misformed otolith . higher doses led to embryonic mortality at  <dig> hpf as reported by blasiole et al.  <cit> . this phenotype could be viewed as opposite to that caused by bpa  i.e. formation of multiple small aggregated otoliths . interestingly when we co-treated embryos with  <dig>  mm ouabain +  <dig> μm bpa a normal otolith formation was observed : two otoliths are present in these fish. we interpret this as a rescue of the bpa effect by ouabain treatment. this suggests that the two compounds have opposite effects: on the one hand, bpa promotes multiplication and aggregation of otoliths, whereas, inversely, ouabain blocks their formation. we thus explored the dose-dependency of this effect. using a lower dose of ouabain  induced only very limited rescue of the full dose bpa phenotype. however, with this half dose ouabain and full dose bpa embryos were less severely affected than the full dose bpa alone . in contrast, full dose ouabain plus lower dose bpa  treated embryos also displayed normal otoliths, with two distinct otoliths while only one misshapen otolith resulted from full dose ouabain alone .

it has been recently reported that the morpholino knock-down of one subunit of na+/k+ atpase α 1a. <dig>  phenocopies the ouabain inhibition of otolith formation  <cit> . we thus tested if α 1a. <dig> was required for the occurrence of the bpa phenotype. we observed the same phenotype as blasiole et al.  <cit>  after α 1a. <dig> morpholino injection, i.e. a complete loss of otolith . treatment with  <dig> μm bpa of α 1a. <dig> morphants  gives rise to the same phenotype as α 1a. <dig> morphants alone: the complete loss of otolith . when a lower dose of morpholino is used, a single small otolith is observed . when morpholino treated embryos are treated with  <dig> μm of bpa, extra otoliths  are observed . however high level of otolith aggregates are never observed . this result suggests that a lower level of na+/k+ atpase alpha  <dig> can reduce the bpa-induced effect on the otolith, though this relationship needs further analysis .

one possibility to explain these results would be that bpa induces expression of α1a. <dig>  we therefore tested if bpa treatment modulates α1a. <dig> expression at  <dig> hpf . we found that it is not the case: α1a. <dig> is detected both in terms of localization and intensity in a similar way in control and in bpa treated embryos. blasiole et al.,  <cit>  showed that three other na+/k+ atpases are expressed in the developing ear. we carried out in situ hybridization with probes for these three other na+/k+ atpase enzymes in bpa treated embryos. no effect on their expression was found compared to control embryos . these data allow us to exclude the possibility that na+/k+ atpase genes are regulated at the transcriptional level by bpa. however, it remains possible that bpa interferes with na+/k+ atpase function in other indirect ways, e.g. by inhibiting its enzymatic activity, by interfering with the stability of the protein and/or its post-translational modifications or affecting sub-cellular distribution.

discussion
bpa affects otolith development
despite the fact that the effects of bpa on development have been the subject of numerous investigations, few experiments have explored effects during embryogenesis  <cit> . here, the distinct advantages of the aquatic, free-living embryos used in this study come to the fore, notably their external and maternally-independent development, and their transparency that together facilitate investigation of morphological phenotypes. indeed, the main result from our study is that bpa specifically affects otolith development during zebrafish and xenopus development. the otolith phenotype that we observed is not linked to the cardiac effect previously observed since the timing of the two events differ, the otolith phenotype being dependent on treatments carried out during earlier developmental periods. our data show that bpa acts early in development, during zebrafish embryogenesis, before  <dig> hpf to affect otolith formation and that this effect is specific to bpa and closely related bisphenols, since another molecule of the same class  does not have the same effect. this observation underscores the possible relevance of the phenotype we describe.

it is interesting to note that the timing of bpa exposure resulting in otolith phenotype actually corresponded to the timing of otic vesicle organogenesis. the otic placode becomes visible at approximately  <dig> hpf and forms a vesicle with a lumen by cavitation at approximately  <dig> hpf  <cit>  . two otoliths appear in the lumen by  <dig>  hpf, and at about  <dig> hpf, the first sensory hair cells are seen, grouped in two small patches, one beneath each otolith, corresponding to the future macula. we found that bpa affects inner ear development in a precise window, at the time of the first sign of morphological appearance of the otoliths, that is at  <dig> hpf. indeed, if bpa treatment was delayed till just  <dig> or  <dig> hpf, no effects on otolith formation were found. this precise timing of bpa action is indicative of an interaction with specific targets active during early otolith development. these observations emphasize that the effects are not due to acute toxicity but are due to a specific interference with a developmental process. the fact that other bisphenols are inactive also suggests that bpa interacts with a precise selectivity on specific targets. in addition no sign of acute cellular stress such as apoptotic cells or necrotic patches were detected in the embryos after bpa exposure .

it is important to note that bpa induces abnormalities of otolith development in two distant vertebrate species, zebrafish and xenopus. interestingly, the two phenotypes are different. in zebrafish we observed aggregates of otoliths with sometimes loss of one of the otolith. in contrast, in xenopus bpa induces a strong dose-dependent reduction in the development of otoliths and a severe reduction of the semi-circular canals. in zebrafish we sometimes observed abnormalities of semicircular canals but with variable penetrance. we consider that this late phenotype may be a consequence of an early defect. in xenopus, bpa was recently shown to induce malformations of the head region  <cit> . in this study, treatment with  <dig> or  <dig> μm of bpa resulted in scoliosis and malformation of the head region including a shortened distance between the eyes. here, we observed a similar phenotype when bpa treatment was begun at the egg stage at these concentrations.

our experiments reveal that only some bisphenols affect otolith development. bpa, bpe and to a lesser extent bpf induced otolith phenotypes whereas bpc was inactive. these differences could be attributed at least in part to dissimilarities in terms of bioavailability and metabolism of bisphenols in embryos, resulting in variations in concentrations of these bisphenols in target tissues. comparing the fate of bpa and bpf, the bio-concentration and biotransformation of these compounds differed substantially. residual levels of bpa in embryos were  <dig>  fold higher than calculated for bpf. furthermore, in the case of bpa no break-down products were found, as most of bpf was fully metabolized by the end of the experiment. due to methodological limitations, these metabolic analyses could not be extended to other bisphenols. however, the data indicate that the extent of the phenotypic effects may be related to the uptake, biotransformation and elimination of these chemicals by zebrafish embryos. perez et al.  <cit> , using mcf <dig> human breast cancer cells in culture, demonstrated that the estrogenicity of bisphenols was influenced not only by the length of the substituents at the bridging carbon, but also by their nature. in a yeast two-hybrid assay, chen et al.  <cit>  ranked the estrogenicity of bisphenols as follows: bpb > bpp > bpa > bpe > bpf > bps. interestingly we found that some of these compounds also act to reduce pigmentation and that the pharmacology of this effect is clearly different: for pigmentation bpe and bpf are clearly the most active compounds, followed by bpc and bpa that show modest effects. these data suggest that bisphenols interfere with different targets in the otoliths and in the pigmentation developmental pathways.

the lowest concentration at which an effect was observed was  <dig> μm, but with low penetrance . at  <dig> μm the majority of the embryos were affected and all at  <dig> μm. the lowest active concentration  corresponds to more than  <dig> mg/ml several orders of magnitude higher than the levels reported in aquatic environments  <cit>  or in human serum  <cit> . of note however is the fact that the concentration of bpa found in amniotic fluid was approximately five-fold higher than levels measured in maternal plasma  <cit> . even these high concentrations however are markedly lower than the one needed in our assay to generate a phenotype. thus, the effect we observe in the aquatic species is probably not relevant to human populations.

a previously undescribed otolith aggregate phenotype
the development of the inner ear in fish and amphibians is representative of the development of inner ears of vertebrates in general. vertebrate inner ear development is a self-contained model system for fundamental research into genetic control of development and, as shown here, for detecting the effects of potential edcs on early vertebrate development. whitfield et al.  <cit>  carried out a large scale screen of zebrafish mutants induced by n-ethyl-n-nitrosurea treatment. mutations occurring in no less than  <dig> genes leading to defects in the development of either the semicircular canals and/or the otoliths were identified  <cit> . in this screen the authors did not examine fine morphology of the inner ear, such as hair cells, and so they estimate that many more genes are potentially involved in the process.

interestingly, bpa induces a new zebrafish otolith phenotype. most of the phenotypes of otolith formation are caused by the specific knock-down or mutation of a given gene  <cit> . many of them result in a small malformed ear, a defect in the ap or dv axis, or in specific deletion of specific structures  but to our knowledge the phenotype we describe here has not been previously described. the abnormalities we observe included aggregation of up to  <dig> otoliths , appearance of multiple otoliths or their absence . it is clear that the majority of the embryos exhibit a bilateral aggregation of both the anterior and posterior otoliths. this is clearly different  to the loss of otolith observed by blasiole et al.  <cit>  after treatment with ouabain or morpholino knock-down of the na+/k+ atpase α1a. <dig>  in fact the phenotype that we find most similar to the effect of bpa is the one seen after inhibition of the oc <dig> gene, a member of pla2-like otoconin family  <cit> . it is interesting to note that oc <dig> is clearly upregulated in the otic vesicle after bpa treatment suggesting it may be play an important role in generating the bpa phenotype. nevertheless we still observed the otolith aggregation induced by bpa following oc <dig> knock-down, suggesting that this gene is not required for bpa action. given the fact that bpa up-regulates oc <dig> expression we cannot exclude that oc <dig> act as a modifier of bpa action but this remains to be addressed experimentally.

the developmental basis of the phenotype was analyzed by studying the expression of gene markers. we found that the patterning of the otic vesicle placode and the hindbrain segmentation are normal and that the antero-posterior and dorso-ventral axes of the otic vesicle are correctly patterned. thus, despite the fact that bpa acts prior to  <dig> hpf we only detect defects with gene markers at later stages, suggesting these modified expressions derive from early action of bpa on an unknown target. the change of gene markers observed suggests that the phenotype extends much further than a simple abnormality in otolith formation. indeed, with aldh1a <dig> and/or ugdh we observed a loss of expression in specific regions such as cranial epithelial projections, endolymphatic duct and in the posterior cristae. this result is in accordance with the fact that we often see, with a variable penetrance, morphological alterations of the semicircular canals. of note are the changes of expression observed in otic vesicle markers after bpa treatment, which are reminiscent of the changes reported by petko et al.,  <cit>  after oc <dig> inhibition, with a normal msxc and dlx3b expression in both cases. the early timing of the effects in our data suggest that bpa exposure can have multiple consequences for the late development of the ear, resulting in abnormal formation of the otolith as well as other defects such as in the semicircular canals. unfortunately, results from the in situ analysis do not really clarify the causes of the dramatic phenotype in otolith aggregates. up-regulation of oc <dig> might be a determinant factor for this phenotype. in fish, otoliths are composed of calcium carbonate crystals condensed on a core protein matrix. oc <dig>  is the ortholog of the mammalian otoconin- <dig> gene which encodes the major matrix protein of otoconia. therefore it is tempting to speculate the with an excess of signal that will lead to the development of the otolith the consequences will be an excess of otolith as observed in our bpa treated embryos. the precise mechanisms underlying this effect have yet to be understood.

interaction with nuclear receptor pathways
much data in the literature show that bpa interferes with the estrogen signalling pathway through direct binding to erα or erβ and thereby induce an er agonist or serm   <cit> . we have indeed verified that bpa binds to and positively regulates the activity of the three ers present in zebrafish, although at higher concentration  than in mammals  <cit> .

estrogen receptor signalling is intricately implicated in the development, function and regeneration of the inner ear  <cit> . it was therefore a reasonable working hypothesis that the effects of bpa implicated interference with er signalling during otic vesicle development. we tested this hypothesis in three ways. first, we examined the effects of estrogen agonist and antagonist activity on otolith development either alone or in combination with effective doses of bpa. we observed only a weak increase of the cotreatment of bpa and ici on the number of affected fish . secondly, we studied if bpa in zebrafish could activate an ere-luc transgenic reporter gene  <cit> . we found a modest effect at the concentrations that clearly induce the phenotype . these data thus suggest that bpa does not act in an estrogen receptor-dependent manner during otolith development. several recent observations in the literature indeed suggest that bpa have a much broader set of targets than previously expected. for example, recently the genes responding in male zebrafish liver to the exposure to  <dig> β-estradiol, and bpa were identified through a microarray analysis  <cit> . interestingly these data reveal that the transcriptional network regulated by  <dig> β-estradiol and bpa in zebrafish are very different. these observations are fully consistent with estrogen receptor-independent effects of bpa that we describe here through developmental analysis. the fact that we observed a synergy when we treated the fish with bpa and with the anti-estrogen ici suggests a possible connection of the bpa targets and estrogen signalling. this idea is consistent with several recent observations suggest that both in mammals and fish the estrogen signalling play a role in hearing, suggesting a possible connection with otic vesicle formation  <cit> . the molecular and developmental basis of this cross-talk remains to be explored.

several data have recently suggested that both tr isoforms  can be targets of bpa . in transient transfection experiments, bpa  suppressed t3-stimulated transcriptional activity stimulated in a dose dependent manner. since t <dig> and trβ are important for ear development  <cit>  we thus tested if the action of bpa in zebrafish otolith development could be linked to its interference with the tr signalling system. we observed no obvious interaction between bpa, t <dig> and otolith formation: the addition of  <dig> μm t <dig> did not interfere, either positively or negatively, with the phenotype induced by bpa. bpa was tested at an optimal  or a suboptimal  dose of bpa and in none of these situations did we observe an effect of added t <dig>  thus, interference with the th signaling pathway does not seem to be responsible for the bpa-induced phenotype. however, induction of deactivating deiodinases by the exogenous t <dig> cannot be excluded, a phenomenon that would neutralize the exogenous t <dig>  the lack of bpa interaction with th signalling is in accordance with our previous observation that altered expression patterns of trs during otic vesicle development in zebrafish could not be detected  <cit> .

the bpa-induced phenotype and na+/k+ atpase activity
na+/k+ atpase are key enzymes implicated in cell homeostasis by the maintenance of electrochemical gradients. na+/k+ atpase activity has been implicated in otic vesicle formation and otolith development shown by treatment with a chemical inhibitor and morpholinos that inhibit a subunit of this enzyme  <cit> . the na+/k+ atpase enzyme is composed of functionally distinct subunits each with multiple isoforms encoded by different genes  <cit> . in the case of inner ear development, inhibition of na+/k+ atpase subunits interferes with otolith and semicircular canal biogenesis, though the mechanisms implicated are still unclear  <cit> . numerous cell types are implicated in the formation of otoliths  <cit> . in fish, otoliths are secreted into the otocyst  then captured by cilia of specialised cells that tether the anterior and posterior otoliths in place at each pole of the otocyst. the first crystals tethered serve as seeds for further growth. na+/k+ atpase could be required for determining electrochemical gradients during various parts of these processes. in the growth of the semicircular canals, na+/k+ atpase subunits are expressed in the areas that give rise to the protrusions that determine their growth.

in our experiments both bpa and ouabain, the inhibitor of na+/k+ atpase, induced opposite phenotypes and combination of lower doses of each chemical rescued otolith formation. this result could indicate that the effects of bpa are dependent on an na+/k+ atpase activity and one of the heterodimeric enzymes expressed in ear. to test this hypothesis knock-down of α1a. <dig>  the major na+/k+ atpase subunit expressed in the otic vesicle was carried out and showed that, indeed, the bpa phenotype cannot be observed without this enzyme. nevertheless this effect is difficult to interpret since it may be simply be linked to the inability of α1a.1-morphants embryo to form otoliths properly. combined with the pharmacological interaction noted above , a possible scenario is that α1a. <dig>  and more generally na+/k+ atpase activity act downstream of bpa target genes in the otic vesicle. however, this is not the case as we saw no effects of bpa exposure on the expression of α1a. <dig> or on other na+/k+ atpase subunits . it is also possible that the two pathways are independent. if α1a. <dig> is strictly required for otolith formation, the morphogenesis defects induced by bpa cannot be observed in the absence of otolith. by injecting a sub-optimal dose of α1a. <dig> the signalling cascade dependent on α1a. <dig> can be activated causing a small otolith to form. once formation is initiated, this otolith treated with bpa will still form an aggregate but due do a low level of α1a.1protein present in the embryo, due to morpholino injection, the aggregate phenotype is mild compared to wild type. this scenario implies that the effect of bpa on na+/k+ atpase and otolith formation is indirect. however, if this were the case one would not see a rescuing effect of bpa and ouabain combination that we observed. taken together, these results suggest a link between bpa and na+/k+ atpase during induction of otolith malformation, but the precise molecular nature of this link and the exact degree of this dependency remains to be explored.

CONCLUSIONS
in this manuscript we show that bpa affects otolith development in two vertebrate species, zebrafish and xenopus. in both cases the deleterious effects are limited to a time window corresponding to the period of otic vesicle development. moreover, neither estrogen nor estrogen antagonists, nor th modify the bpa response, underscoring the concept that the effects observed are estrogen and th-independent. we conclude that vertebrate organogenesis can be modified by bpa through novel mechanisms. a clear link with the na+/k+ atpase system was observed. our experiments provide an example of a developmentally relevant defect generated by bpa treatment that is independent of its main mode of action which is interaction with the estrogenic or th signalling pathways. these results suggests that the classical way of studying endocrine disruptors, that is by defining precise "end points" based on classical risk assessment data can some time be misleading because the focus on a specific type of defect  <cit> . in these cases, phenotypes based on unknown mode of action of the molecule will be overlooked. we believe that zebrafish and xenopus, that allow medium-throughput screening of edcs, will be powerful systems to test the effects of these compounds in an unbiased manner.
