BACKGROUND
equine atypical myopathy affects horses and ponies kept on pasture and not exercised either prior to or at the time of the first clinical signs. all cases have been reported in the springtime or autumn and after a sudden drop in the minimum daily temperature  <cit> . affected horses are usually well and suddenly display signs of acute myopathy , with no hyperthermia and unchanged appetite  <cit> . unlike the other types of myopathy, this condition is often fatal within  <dig> to  <dig> hours. blood analysis consistently shows a spectacular increase in muscle enzymes, in particular the creatine-kinases  <cit> . recently, a detailed macroscopical, histopathological, enzymohistochemical and ultrastructural study of  <dig> clinical cases was reported  <cit> . the morphopathological picture of the disease suggested a mitochondrial disorder the characteristics of which are compatible with those of equine toxic myopathies due to plant, bacterial or fungal toxins  <cit> . although morphologic clues of mitochondrial dysfunction in these equine diseases have accumulated, a functional confirmation is still pending. also, as the clinical diagnosis is only possible late in the course of these diseases, when definitive lesions have occurred, an early marker is crucially needed to improve the clinical prognosis of established cases and to detect subclinical cases that would benefit of preventive measures. epidemiological studies aimed at delineating the precise environmental conditions that increase the risk of developing atypical myopathy would also gain from a standardized laboratory test that lends itself to mass screening. therefore, reliable methods for the sensitive determination of a possible alteration of mitochondrial function in equine tissues are desirable.

the cationic dye jc- <dig> exhibits potential-dependent accumulation in mitochondria, indicated by a fluorescence shift from green  to orange . this potential-sensitive color shift is due to the concentration-dependent intramitochondrial formation of orange fluorescent oligomers  <cit> . as a consequence, mitochondrial membrane potential  can be optically measured by the orange/green fluorescence intensity ratio. this ratio is dependent only on the Δψm and not on other factors such as mitochondrial size, shape, and density, which renders jc- <dig> far more reliable than any other single-component fluorescence signals to evaluate mitochondrial function. jc- <dig> orange-green fluorescence ratio has been used as an indicator of mitochondrial potential in isolated mitochondria  <cit>  but also in intact tissues  <cit> , spermatozoa  <cit>  and cell lines, including myocytes  <cit>  and neurons  <cit> . very subtle heterogeneity in cellular responses were already discerned in this way  <cit> , the most widely implemented application being for detection of mitochondrial depolarization occurring during apoptosis  <cit> . this series of studies prompted us to suggest that jc-1-associated orange/green ratio could function as a marker of mitochondrial dysfunction in the clinic. since mitochondrial dysfunction precedes morphologic alterations, it would permit an early diagnosis of mitochondria-associated rhabdomyolyses in horses. although muscle biopsies would directly target the tissue of choice, questions remains about the muscle to be sampled  <cit> . furthermore, multiple biopsies should be avoided in the routine clinic due to animal welfare concerns. these practical considerations led us to evaluate the candidature of jc- <dig> as an indicator of mitochondrial potential in equine peripheral blood mononuclear cells. in this paper, a standardized analytic procedure is proposed along with a critical appraisal of the crucial questions of reproducibility, effect of time elapsed between blood sampling and laboratory processing and reference values.

RESULTS
flow cytometric analysis of physical characteristics of equine pbmc, using forward  and side  scatters, consistently revealed two distinct subpopulations . the first is characterized by low fsc and ssc and presumably corresponds to lymphocytes. subsequent analysis of fluorescent labelling of pbmc using appropriate monoclonal antibodies confirmed that this population indeed consisted of lymphocytes. the second subpopulation, showing slightly higher fsc and ssc, is rather compatible with monocytes. because the first subpopulation was always less scattered than the second, it was chosen to gate the cell subpopulation of which the jc-1-associated fluorescences were studied.

using  <dig> nm sapphire™ solid-state laser excitation, the gated nonstained cell populations showed readily identifiable and very homogeneous autofluorescent emissions within the 530/ <dig> and 585/ <dig> nm bandpass windows . however, the gated stained cell populations displayed much more intense fluorescences in both windows , which yielded an excellent signal-to-noise ratio. among the ~ <dig> stained cell populations of which the results contributed to this study, there was never > 1% of cells falling in the green autofluorescence window, showing that the jc- <dig> concentration used is sufficient to stain all cells despite the unavoidable slight variation of the number of cells between cell suspensions. for the orange autofluorescence, identical results were obtained, excepted for a few cell suspensions intoxicated with cccp where up to 5% of the cells fell in the autofluorescence window, which is attributable to the total dissipation of the Δψm, thus of oligomers formation, in these cells. the incorporation of cccp led to the expected decrease of the oligomer/monomer  fluorescences ratio . although  <dig> μm cccp was used throughout the study, a dose-response study made in  <dig> horses suggested that maximal mitochondrial dysfunction is already reached with  <dig> μm.

afterwards, mean absolute fluorescence values and ratio were measured in blood samples that had been kept at room temperature for different durations before laboratory processing . no differences were seen up to  <dig> hours . also, when horses were sampled several times , the jc-1-associated fluorescence values retrieved from the corresponding pbmc populations  remained unchanged . regression of the orange/green ratio against age was not significant and sex-specific means of the ratio with  and without intoxication  were not different . together, the  <dig> horses studied  have generated mean values that can be taken as references :  <dig> ±  <dig> ,  <dig> ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  .

horses contributing to days  <dig> and  <dig> were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  horses contributing to the four days were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> * mean fluorescence values of  <dig>  pbmcs are given in arbitrary units. analysis of variance did not reveal any significant effect of the day of measurement .

discussion
a method for the quantitative analysis of mitochondrial function in horse blood samples has been developed and validated. after pbmc purification and resuspension in pbs, cells are stained with jc- <dig> and analysed by flow cytometry. to our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondrial function analysis with jc- <dig> in peripheral blood cells. we have shown that the homogeneity of cell staining and the signal-to-autofluorescence ratio are as favourable as they were in cell lines  <cit> . interestingly, values measured after artificial intoxication are one order of magnitude  lower than values measured from nontreated pbmc, which offers a large window to detect even subtle mitochondrial function changes. with respect to possible variation within each animal, we have shown that a clinically healthy horse generates similar mitochondrial function values over time. more, these values are independent of age and sex and were very homogeneous among the cohort of horses enrolled. taken together, the present study therefore yields a reference value of mitochondrial function in equine pbmc, along with the calculation of the confidence interval in which 95% of healthy horses are predicted to fall:  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . should smaller animals, such as dogs and cats, be assayed, histopaque columns designed for smaller volumes must be used for purification and the final concentration of mononuclear cells suspensions should not be less than  <dig>  per millilitre.

the starting point of this study consists in the compilation of several morphologic clues suggesting that a subset of equine myopathies might be attributable to mitochondrial dysfunction. these morphological suspicions have to be confirmed by functional data to gain credibility. here, a new assay system is validated that, theoretically, could bring such functional confirmation. by "theoretically", it is meant that the assay will prove to be useful if and only if the mitochondrial dysfunction subjacent to a said clinical syndrome simultaneously affects circulating leucocytes. there is no relationship per se between myopathy and oxidative phosphorylation taking place in leucocytes, only the assumption that a mitochondrial myopathy is probably a polysystemic disease rather than a specific process affecting only the muscles. the polysystemic disease might clinically translate in a locomotor syndrome just because of the higher mitochondrial density in oxidative muscles.

CONCLUSIONS
whenever a quantitative measurement of mitochondrial function in a horse is desired, blood samples should be taken in sodium citrate tubes and kept at room temperature for a maximum of  <dig> hours before the laboratory procedure detailed here is started. this delay fits well with most field conditions, provided the samples must not be sent by post. we hope that the quantitative analysis of mitochondrial function procedure validated here will help in confirming, studying and preventing equine atypical myopathy and toxic myopathies due to plant, bacterial and fungal mitochondrial toxins.
