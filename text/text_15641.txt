BACKGROUND
eggplant  is a species belonging to the solanaceae family. it is assumed to have been first domesticated in south and east asia  <cit> , and brought to europe by arab traders and immigrants around  <dig> ce  <cit> . in production terms, eggplant is the third most important solanaceae crop species , and is cultivated all over the world, but most intensively in china and india. about  <dig> % of world production in  <dig> is sited in europe, with italy being the single largest producer.

the estimated genome size of eggplant is  <dig>  gbp  <cit> . knowledge of its genome organization is rather limited compared to that of either tomato or potato . genetic maps based on both inter-specific  <cit>  and intra-specific  <cit>  crosses have been developed. the most recent inter-specific map  <cit>  is constituted of  <dig> cos and rflp markers spanning  <dig>  cm, while the most recent intra-specific maps were constructed by barchi et al.  <cit>  and nunome et al.  <cit>  and comprise  <dig> markers, spanning  <dig> , and  <dig> markers, spanning  <dig>  cm, respectively. nevertheless the level of marker saturation is still low in the context of both fine mapping and genomic synteny. a small set of ssr markers was developed by stagel et al.  <cit>  from genic dna sequence lodged in public access databases, while nunome et al.  <cit>  reported the identification of over  <dig>  ssr markers from a screen of enriched gdna and cdna libraries. many of these latter proved informative for intra-specific mapping and have been used to generate what is currently the best available genetic linkage map. more recently, fukuoka et al.  <cit>  have published a dataset containing a large number  of transcript sequences, but these have yet to be mined for either ssr or snp markers.

the so-called "restriction-site associated dna"  method was proposed by miller et al.  <cit>  as providing a reliable means for genome complexity reduction. the concept is based on acquiring the sequence adjacent to a set of particular restriction enzyme recognition sites. the application of high throughput sequencing technology has allowed significant progress in developing a rad genotyping platform  <cit> ; specifically, large volumes of polymorphism data can be now generated by applying massively parallel sequencing and multiplexing with rad tag libraries.

in this report we describe the generation of genomic rad tags from the two parents of an f <dig> segregating population used to generate an intra-specific eggplant genetic map  <cit> ; the rad tags were sequenced using the illumina platform and then annotated/categorized. these data allowed the discovery of a large number of snp, indel and ssr markers, and some of the snps have been tested against a panel of eggplant accessions.

RESULTS
sequencing and contig assembly
the sequencing procedure  generated  <dig>  million reads for '305e40' and  <dig>  million for '67/3', parents of an f <dig> intra-specific mapping population , equivalent to ~ <dig>  mb of sequence for '305e40' and  <dig>  mb for '67/3'. after editing/trimming, ~ <dig>  mb high quality sequence was available. raw data have been made available through the sequence read archive  repository at ncbi . the reads were assembled into  <dig>  contigs ; the '305e40' assemblies were of mean length  <dig> bp , and those from '67/3' of mean length  <dig> bp . the sm-i  dataset finally comprised  <dig>  sequences, including  <dig>  sequences  in common between the two mapping parents , and formed the basis of the subsequent annotation and functional categorization . the sm-i dataset was also screened for the occurrence of repetitive elements. about  <dig> %  of the sequence database showed some similarity with known plant mobile elements and was thus filtered out for snp mining procedures.

 <dig> n50: weighted median statistic such that 50% of the entire assembly is contained in the number of contigs equal to or greater than this value

sequence annotation
in all,  <dig>  sequences  of the sm-i dataset matched  <dig>  entries in the fukuoka  <dig> k eggplant annotated unigene dataset   <cit> . a blastn search of the sgn cornell unigene database  produced significant hits from  <dig>   of the sm-i sequences matching  <dig>  sgn unigenes, of which ~47% originated from tomato, ~38% from potato, and ~11% from tobacco. combining the  <dig> k and sgn hits produced  <dig>  unique sequences; a total of  <dig>  sequences were properly annotated, of which  <dig>  were annotated in both the sgn and  <dig> k databases,  <dig>  only in sgn, and  <dig>  only in  <dig> k. some  <dig>  sm-i sequences were unrepresented in either of these two databases, and these were used as a batch blastx query against the tair <dig> arabidopsis thaliana protein database to allow a putative assignment of function. in all,  <dig>  sequences  produced a hit with an e value of < e- <dig>  corresponding to  <dig>  a. thaliana genes. this rather small number of hits presumably reflects sequence divergence between eggplant and a. thaliana orthologs, although it has been recognized that the blast algorithm can be rather inefficient in identifying homologous sequences when short reads are involved  <cit> . globally, therefore, the sm-i dataset consists of some  <dig>  annotated sequences which match  <dig>  a. thaliana loci .

go categorization
the annotated sm-i sequences were functionally assigned using their a. thaliana orthologs as input  , these functions were then arranged into go slim categories   <cit> . since a given gene product can be associated with more than one go term, the total number of go terms exceeded that of the unigenes  <cit> . the eggplant sm-i sequences resolved into  <dig>  go terms associated with "biological process",  <dig>  with "cellular component" and  <dig>  with "molecular function". the "response to biotic stimulus" category applied to  <dig> sequences , among which the majority was related to the defense response against bacterial , nematode  and fungal  infection. these sequences, especially the fungal response ones, are of particular interest, as '305e40' carries a major gene conferring resistance to fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melongenae  <cit> . among the "response to abiotic stimulus" sequences ,  <dig> % were associated with the response to salinity stress,  <dig> % to low temperature and  <dig> % to high temperature. globally, the sequences were assigned to a wide range of gene ontology categories, indicating that a wide representation of transcripts was originally present in the rad tags. since about  <dig>  sm-i eggplant sequences were annotated, it seems plausible to assume that we were able to capture a consistent fraction of the eggplant gene space.

snp identification
just over  <dig>  snps were identified between the mapping parents, involving  <dig>  of the  <dig>  shared sequences , as well as  <dig> indels . to minimize false positives with respect to the snps, paired-end reads and snp calling based on deep multiple alignment  were applied. the global inter-samples snp frequency was  <dig>  per kb, and the indel frequency  <dig>  per kb. we report the current snp frequency as mostly belonging to the un-transcribed portion of the eggplant genome since we adopted two endonucleases recognizing gc-rich sites, being one methylation sensitive . this snp frequency is lower than has been detected in potato , grapevine , barley , maize  and citrus spp. , but is similar to that found in tomato , sweet pepper , rice  and confirmed the low level of intra-specific genetic polymorphism previously observed in eggplant  <cit> . as pointed out by schneider et al.  <cit> , however, inter-specific comparisons of snp frequency are problematic, given that polymorphism is germplasm-, genomic context- and mating system-dependent. about two thirds of the snps proved to be transitions , which have generally been found to be the predominant type  <cit> . the transition/transversion ratio has been suggested to be high in a situation where a low level of genetic divergence applies, decreasing as the genetic distance between the comparator genomes rises  <cit> . the relatively high ratio of  <dig>  probably therefore reflects the overall low level of polymorphism between the two mapping parents, as is generally the case within the cultivated gene pool of eggplant  <cit> . a rather high frequency of c/t alleles was observed, as also noted for bean  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and citrus spp.  <cit> . in about 25% of the snp loci, there was no additional sequence variation in either the upstream or the downstream  <dig> bp and almost all of them  were associated with a quality score >  <dig>   and  <dig>  produced a score of >  <dig> . the identification of >  <dig>  potential snps is clearly a major advance for eggplant genotyping; incorporation of a sample of the  <dig>  high quality snps into a goldengate assay would certainly saturate the '305e40' Ã— '67/3' linkage map, while many of the remaining ~ <dig>  snps could be assayed by other technologies, such as the affymetrix snp chip or the high resolution melting technique  <cit> .

the successful identification of a large number of snp  markers highlights the utility of the rad approach for uncovering genome-wide polymorphisms, especially in materials with low polymorphism  <cit> . the versatility of the method lies in the ease with which different samples of the genome can be accessed merely by changing the identity of the restriction enzyme used to cleave the genomic dna; its particular advantage in the context of snp discovery lies in the ease of aligning short dna fragments between contrasting templates. note also that the application of illumina sequencing allowed for the identification of polymorphic sites outside of the restriction enzyme recognition site  <cit> .

genetic diversity revealed by snp markers
a sample of  <dig> of the  <dig>  highest quality snps  was assembled into a goldengate assay, which was then applied to genotype  <dig> s. melongena templates , a representative panel of eggplant germplasm which captured a large part of variation with respect to fruit shape and colour , together with one accession of s. aethiopicum. of these,  <dig> produced non- ambiguous data, a percentage in agreement with that previously reported in maize  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> . the two duplicated genotypes included as internal controls gave consistent calls, indicating that the assay was highly robust. the frequency of missed calls was ~  <dig> % among the eggplant templates, but was  <dig> % for the s. aethiopicum template. pic values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , with  <dig> of the markers producing a pic value >  <dig> , a level which is suitable for genetic diversity analyses. the phylogeny of the germplasm accessions based on these snps suggested the presence of two major clades ; one included '305e40' together with its progenitors 'dourga', 'tal1/1', 'dr2' and s. aethiopicum, while the second included '67/3'. within each of these major clades, a number of sub-clades correlated with fruit shape could be recognized. thus, the phenotypic divergence between the pair of mapping parents appears to be representative of the genetic variation present within the cultivated gene pool.

identification of ssrs
a screen of the sm-i dataset resulted in the identification of  <dig>  sequences containing  <dig>  putative ssrs. a small number of these ssrs  were discarded as they had already been previously identified  <cit> . the ssr was present in both mapping parents for  <dig>  sequences, in '305e40' alone for  <dig> sequences, and in '67/3' alone for  <dig> sequences. at least  <dig>  sequences permitted the design of pcr primers, leading to the generation of  <dig>  putative markers . about  <dig> % of the sm-i sequences contained an ssr , which is comparable to the success rate recorded from ests of eggplant  <cit>  and tomato  <cit> , somewhat higher than in potato  <cit>  but lower than in either coffee  <cit>  or sweet pepper  <cit> . thus the rad technique appears to offer an effective means of discovering ssrs, especially given the understanding that ssrs are more common in transcribed rather than in genomic sequences  <cit> .

the most abundant repeat motif among the rad ssrs were trinucleotides , followed by dinucleotides  and pentanucleotides  , consistent with the observations of stagel et al.  <cit> . the most common di- and tri-nucleotide motifs were at  and aac  , in contrast to the observation in a previous study, where ag and aag were the predominant motifs  <cit> . on the other hand shirasawa et al.  <cit>  showed that among tomato genomic ssrs, aat is the most abundant trinucleotide and at the most abundant dinucleotide motif, while in wheat, aac is the predominant trinucleotide ssr motif  <cit> . ssrs composed of either agg and ccg repeats were rather rare, as reported by stagel et al.  <cit>  in eggplant but also in other recent studies on epimidium sagittatum  <cit>  and vigna radiata  <cit> . these particular motifs are relatively uncommon in dicotyledonous plant genomes  <cit> , although they do feature in monocotyledonous ones  <cit> . among the  <dig> mononucleotide ssrs detected,  <dig> were a/t; these loci have been suggested as providing a means of filling gaps in linkage maps constructed with higher order ssrs  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the rad method was highly successful for the rapid and large-scale discovery of dna markers, even in a species recognized to be low polymorphic. applied to a pair of eggplant mapping parents, the approach was able to define over  <dig>  snps,  <dig>  indels and  <dig>  putative ssrs. the current eggplant genetic maps are far from saturated, and as such have had little impact on breeding. the early maps were based on a wide cross, as this was considered necessary to achieve a sufficient level of polymorphism for the markers then available. with the rapid advances being made in sequencing technology, it is now possible to work with intra-specific crosses which are more relevant to the breeder. the present study has generated a large number of snp, indel and ssr assays, which should permit the rapid saturation of the best available intra-specific genetic map  <cit> .

our primary goal was the identification of snp markers, however data from rad tags sequencing made it also possible the identification of ssr motifs and respective primers pairs for their amplification. the multi-allelic ssr markers are currently widely applied for both genetic mapping and diversity analyses, despite their cost for development and their limited throughput capabilities  <cit> . during the last few years the exploitation of publicly available est sequences leaded to the identification of several thousands of new ssrs markers in a wide range of vegetables species like tomato, pepper, globe artichoke, brassica, as well as eggplant  <cit> 

the goldengate snp array was highly robust for s. melongena germplasm, but also has potential for a wide-cross population as 84% of the loci were scorable in a contrast between cultivated eggplant and its relative s. aethiopicum. since these dna markers define a specific position in the eggplant genome, they should be useful for merging the various genetic linkage maps currently available, some of which include loci related to important agronomic traits. finally, the markers are very informative for the analysis of genetic diversity, as well as for comparative studies across species within the solanaceae family.
