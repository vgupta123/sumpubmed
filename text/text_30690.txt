BACKGROUND
h. influenzae is a fastidious, gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen that belongs to the family pasteurellaceae and is a common commensal in the nasopharynx of humans
 <cit> . h. influenzae is a causative agent of both invasive and non-invasive diseases including bacteremia, meningitis, respiratory infections, and otitis media
 <cit> . invasive disease may be caused by either encapsulated or nonencapsulated strains
 <cit> , whereas non-invasive diseases are primarily caused by nonencapsulated, nontypeable h. influenzae <cit> .

like most other bacteria, h. influenzae requires iron for growth but it also has an absolute requirement for a porphyrin source, in the form of protoporphyrin ix  or heme, to grow aerobically
 <cit> . this requirement for a porphyrin source is due to the lack of enzymes required to synthesize the protoporphyrin ring. therefore, h. influenzae must acquire heme from host sources in order to establish and sustain an infection
 <cit> . potential sources of heme in the human host are limited; heme is generally intracellular, bound by hemoglobin or other heme-containing proteins, and there is no significant source of ppix
 <cit> . h. influenzae has evolved multiple mechanisms to counter and exploit host mechanisms for sequestering heme from invading pathogens
 <cit> . although many of these mechanisms are transcriptionally upregulated in response to iron and heme restriction, the specific regulation of many of these systems is largely uncharacterized in h. influenzae <cit> .

the rna-binding protein hfq is an important regulator of gene transcription, including the transcription of iron responsive genes, in many bacterial pathogens such as escherichia coli, neisseria meningitidis, and salmonella enterica <cit> . the hfq protein was originally described as a host factor required for the synthesis of bacteriophage qβ rna in e. coli and belongs to the sm and sm-like family of proteins that are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes
 <cit> . hfq has been described as an integral component of post-transcriptional gene regulation because of its ability to bind both small regulatory rnas  and their mrna target, altering the stability of the bound mrna
 <cit> . several studies have revealed the role of hfq and srnas in post-transcriptional regulation of iron responsive genes
 <cit> . hfq is found in many bacterial pathogens and is a pleiotropic gene regulator; mutants exhibit phenotypes including defects in virulence, growth rates, stress tolerance and biofilm formation
 <cit> . the phenotypes of hfq mutants vary greatly between bacterial species because of the wide array of rna with which hfq interacts
 <cit> .

here we report the characterization of a deletion mutant of hfq in h. influenzae. we demonstrate in vitro that hfq is important in modulating the utilization of heme from hemoglobin. further we show that hfq plays a role in pathogenesis in the infant rat and chinchilla models of disease. thus, hfq may be modulating nutrient utilization systems that allow h. influenzae to better adapt to niches within the host during infection.

methods
bacterial strains and growth conditions
nontypeable h. influenzae strain r <dig> is a clinical isolate from the blood of an immunocompetent pediatric patient with clinical signs of meningitis following acute om
 <cit> . nontypeable h. influenzae strain 86-028np was isolated from the nasopharynx of a child being treated for chronic om who underwent tympanostomy and tube insertion
 <cit> . h. influenzae strains were routinely grown on chocolate agar with bacitracin at 37°c. h. influenzae was also cultured on brain heart infusion  agar or in bhi broth supplemented with  <dig> μg ml- <dig> heme and  <dig> μg ml- <dig> β-nad  or bhi supplemented with  <dig> μg ml- <dig> β-nad . the antibiotics spectinomycin  and chloramphenicol  were used when appropriate.

heme sources
human hemoglobin and heme  were purchased from sigma. stock heme solutions were prepared at  <dig>  mg ml- <dig> heme in 4% v/v triethanolamine as previously described
 <cit> . hemoglobin was dissolved in water immediately before use.

construction of the hfq mutant
a deletion mutant lacking the entire hfq gene was constructed using two pairs of primers to amplify regions upstream and downstream of hfq by pcr using strain r <dig> dna as template. primer pair hfq_us <dig>  and hfq_us <dig>  was used to amplify an 867-bp fragment upstream of hfq with ecori and bamhi restriction sites engineered into the primers, respectively, to allow for directional subcloning. hfq_ds <dig>  and hfq_ds <dig>  were used to amplify an 869-bp fragment downstream of hfq with bamhi and hindiii restriction sites incorporated into the primers, respectively. the pcr products were cloned into the ta cloning vector pcr <dig> -topo  and the cloned sequences were confirmed by dna sequencing. after the dna sequences were confirmed, the upstream and downstream fragments were directionally subcloned into puc19n to give a plasmid containing the fragments abutting each other with a unique bamhi site between the two products. the bamhi site was used to insert a 1214-bp fragment containing a spectinomycin resistance cassette from pspecr
 <cit> , and produced the mutagenic construct prh <dig> 

the plasmid construct prh <dig> was used to transform h. influenzae strains r <dig> and 86-028np by the static-aerobic method as previously described
 <cit>  and transformants were selected on spectinomycin. transformants resistant to spectinomycin were confirmed using pcr.

complementation of the hfq deletion mutant
for complementation of the hfq deletion a region encompassing 450-bp upstream to 286-bp downstream of hfq was amplified from strain r <dig> using primers hfqcmp_fwd  and hfqcmp_rev . the primers hfqcmp_fwd and hfqcmp_rev had respectively bamhi and xbai restriction sites incorporated to allow for subcloning. the pcr product was cloned into pcr <dig> -topo and subsequently subcloned into the vector pask <dig> to yield prh <dig>  the vector pask <dig> was designed to allow complementation of gene disruptions in h. influenzae by insertion of a gene in the nonessential outer-membrane protein ompp <dig> locus and has been successfully used in our laboratory
 <cit> . the plasmid prh <dig> was used to transform the r <dig> ∆∆hfq strain, hi <dig>  to chloramphenicol resistance to yield strain hi <dig>  correct insertion of the complementation construct was confirmed by pcr.

primer extension analysis
primer extension analysis was performed as previously described
 <cit> . rna was purified from a h. influenzae culture grown to mid-log phase in sbhi using the qiagen rneasy mini kit. the rna was dnase treated and the integrity was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. a total of  <dig> μg of rna was used to synthesize cdna using a 6-carboxyfluorescein -labeled primer, hfq-pe . the hfq-pe primer was added to the rna and they were incubated at 70°c for  <dig> min and chilled on ice before being incubated at 65°c for  <dig> min. the mixture was incubated at 42°c and the cdna synthesis reagents  were added to the mixture, incubated for  <dig> h, and ethanol precipitated. the sizing of the cdna fragments was performed by the laboratory for genomics and bioinformatics at the university of oklahoma health sciences center. analysis of the fragments was done using peak scanner software .

growth studies with h. influenzae
growth studies were performed using the bioscreen c microbiology reader  as previously described
 <cit> . h. influenzae strains were grown for  <dig> hours on chocolate agar with bacitracin and used to seed hdbhi broth cultures which were incubated for  <dig> h with shaking at 37°c. the  <dig> h cultures were pelleted by centrifugation, washed in phosphate buffered saline  containing  <dig> % w/v gelatin, and resuspended to an optical density of  <dig>  at  <dig> nm in the same buffer. the bacterial suspension was diluted by adding  <dig>  ml into  <dig>  ml of pbs containing  <dig> % gelatin and was used to inoculate media for growth curves .

in vitro competition studies were performed by mixing equal numbers of the wild type and mutant strains  in  <dig> ml of either sbhi or hdbhi supplemented with limiting concentrations of hemoglobin  with no signs of middle ear infection by either otoscopy or tympanometry at the beginning of the study were used. animals were allowed to acclimate to the vivarium for at least  <dig> days prior to transbullar challenge. animal procedures have been previously described in detail
 <cit> .

two separate experiments, one to assess virulence and a second to assess competitive fitness, were performed in the chinchillas.

in the first experiment to compare virulence, two groups of  <dig> animals were challenged in both ears by transbullar injection with approximately  <dig>  cfu of either strain 86-028np or its hfq deletion mutant hi <dig>  transbullar inocula were delivered in  <dig> μl  <dig> % gelatin in pbs by direct injection into the superior bullae. actual bacterial doses were confirmed by plate count. on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> post-challenge middle ear effusions  were collected by epitympanic tap as previously described
 <cit> . bacterial titers in recovered mee were determined using the track dilution method.

in the second experiment, to assess competitive fitness, five animals were challenged in both ears transbullarly with a mixture containing equal numbers of 86-028np and its hfq deletion mutant hi <dig> . epitympanic taps were performed on all ears on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> after nontypeable h. influenzae challenge. recovered mee were plated on sbhi and sbhi containing spectinomycin in order to determine the total bacterial titer and the titer of the mutant strain respectively.

rat model of bacteremia
the infant rat model for hematogeneous meningitis following intraperitoneal infection with h. influenzae <cit>  was used to compare the abilities of strains r <dig> and the ∆hfq mutant, hi <dig>  to cause bacteremia.

again two experiments were performed, one to assess virulence and a second to assess competitive fitness.

specified pathogen free , timed-pregnant sprague–dawley rats  were received approximately five days prior to giving birth. these pregnant females were single housed on hardwood litter with ad libitum access to water and a standard pelleted food . they were maintained on a  <dig> hour light–dark cycle in separate forced air cubicles in a bio-containment facility to prevent cross-contamination. newborn pups from different mothers were pooled and randomly reassigned to the mothers .

in the first experiment to assess virulence two groups of ten 5-day-old infant rats were infected with  <dig>  cfu of either r <dig> or the corresponding hfq mutant hi <dig> suspended in  <dig> μl pbs by intraperitoneal injection. inocula were prepared as previously described
 <cit> . the dosage used to infect the rats was confirmed by plate count. rats were examined for signs of infection  at 24-hour intervals. after placing the animals under anesthesia , cardiac puncture was used to obtain blood specimens on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> post-infection
 <cit> .

in the second experiment to assess competitive fitness a group of ten 5-day old rats was infected by intraperitoneal injection with a 1: <dig> mixed culture  of  <dig>  cfu of each strain in  <dig> μl pbs. rats were examined for clinical signs of infection and bacteremia as described above in the virulence experiment.

the track dilution method was used to quantify bacteremia by serially diluting  whole-blood specimens freshly drawn in heparinized syringes with pbs. aliquots of  <dig> μl from each dilution were plated in triplicate on sbhi agar, with or without the appropriate antibiotic in the case of the fitness study, and incubated at least  <dig> hours at 37°c for quantification.

RESULTS
promoter and sequence analysis of hfq in h. influenzae
hfq is encoded by the gene hi <dig> in the h. influenzae reference strain rd kw <dig>  and consists of  <dig> amino acids and is at least 97% identical to hfq in  <dig> sequenced strains of h. influenzae. furthermore, it is 78% similar to the hfq protein from e. coli and all residues that contribute to rna binding in the latter species are conserved 
 <cit> . by comparison with hi <dig>  the hfq protein in e. coli contains a longer c terminal extension. this c terminal extension is highly variable among different species of bacteria and does not contribute to the overall activity of hfq
 <cit> . the hfq gene is located on the lagging strand of the rd kw <dig> genome and is downstream of the tyrr gene  and upstream of hi <dig> . these same two genes also flank hfq in the h. influenzae strains used in the remainder of this study. the hfq gene is highly conserved among all sequenced strains of h. influenzae, an indication that this gene serves an important function in this species. this would suggest that h. influenzae also uses hfq along with srnas to modulate gene expression, the posited role for hfq in other prokaryotes.

nontypeable h. influenzae strains r <dig> and 86-028np were selected for the studies described herein since both strains have each been well characterized both genetically and phenotypically. both strains have also been extensively used in the animal models described herein
 <cit> . rd kw <dig> was not used for further study because it is considered an avirulent ‘laboratory strain’ of h. influenzae since it has lost the genes that encode the type d capsule and lacks adhesins that are necessary for nontypeable h. influenzae disease
 <cit> .

in several organisms the hfq gene is co-transcribed with the upstream gene miaa when that gene is present
 <cit> . however, in bacterial species in which a gene other than miaa is upstream, hfq is not co-transcribed
 <cit> . rt-pcr experiments performed in r <dig> and 86-028np indicated that hfq is not co-transcribed with either of the flanking genes . primer extension experiments were performed to identify the transcription start site and to help determine the location of the promoter. the major primer restriction product was  <dig> nt in length , corresponding to an adenine transcriptional start site  <dig> nt upstream of the atg start codon .

since the sequence of hfq is well conserved in experimentally relevant strains, hfq deletion mutants were constructed in order to study the role of hfq in h. influenzae. deletion mutants of the hfq genes of h. influenzae nontypeable strains r <dig> and 86-028np were successfully constructed and confirmed by pcr  and were designated hi <dig> and hi <dig> respectively.

in vitro growth characteristics of h. influenzae hfq mutants
in other bacterial species, hfq plays a role in iron regulation and tolerance to various stressors, such as oxidative damage, high salt, and detergents
 <cit> . since h. influenzae requires heme for aerobic growth, we conducted growth studies to investigate whether the deletion of hfq impacted growth and heme source utilization. direct comparisons were made between each wild type strain, and its ∆hfq mutant. the complement strain was also included when studying r <dig> and its mutant. several attempts were made to create a complement for the 86-028np ∆hfq strain, hi <dig>  but were unsuccessful. tested heme sources included free heme, hemoglobin, hemoglobin-haptoglobin and heme-hemopexin at various concentrations. the hfq mutants of both strains grew at a similar rate to the wild type strains in all growth conditions except under limiting concentrations of hemoglobin . complementation of the ∆hfq mutation did not completely restore the wild type phenotype in r <dig>  but the complemented strain did grow significantly better than the ∆hfq strain. in vitro competition experiments were performed in nutrient rich and hemoglobin limiting conditions to determine if competition between the two strains would further inhibit the growth of the ∆hfq strain. no difference was observed between the two strains under either growth condition . these results suggest that hfq may be required for h. influenzae to efficiently utilize certain nutrients from its environment in order to occupy specific niches within the host, as seen in other organisms
 <cit> . previous studies have shown there are two proteins that are required for the uptake of heme from hemoglobin, the tonb-dependent hgps and hup proteins
 <cit> . however, the expression of these genes is unaffected by the deletion of hfq . further studies are needed to understand the potential role of hfq in the utilization of heme from hemoglobin.

the ability of the hfq mutant to tolerate other stressful conditions was also examined. there were no differences observed in growth between the wild type and mutant strains in the presence of oxidative stress induced by the addition of hydrogen peroxide or cumene hydroperoxide . thus, no role was detected for h. influenzae hfq in the regulation of genes involved in ameliorating oxidative stress as it does in other bacterial species
 <cit> . no significant differences in growth between wild type and mutant strains were seen in media containing high salt or sodium dodecyl sulfate  at various concentrations . in other bacteria hfq also plays a role in high salt and detergent stress
 <cit> . these data demonstrate that the phenotypic effects in h. influenzae strains r <dig> and 86-028np lacking hfq differ from those observed in other bacterial species
 <cit> .

role of hfq in h. influenzae pathogenesis
the hfq mutants of the nontypeable strains r <dig> and 86-028np were compared for their abilities to establish and maintain infection in two well established animal models of human h. influenzae disease. the methods used for these studies were designed to test for virulence and fitness of the mutant strains in comparison to their wild type progenitor. the use of different strains is necessary because nontypeable clinical isolates of h. influenzae generally cannot be used across the different animal models of disease. in our hands, 86-028np is unable to cause bacteremia in the infant rat model and r <dig> infected chinchillas rapidly proceed to inner ear infection and bacteremia, criteria for termination of the experiment . therefore, in order to compare mutations in multiple animal models, it is necessary to use different h. influenzae strains.

the nontypeable h. influenzae strain 86-028np was compared with the hfq mutant hi <dig> in the chinchilla model of otitis media. two separate experiments were performed; a paired comparison assay to determine virulence, and a competition assay to determine fitness defects in the ∆hfq strain. in the virulence assay, two groups of five animals were challenged with the wild type and mutant strains, respectively, and assessed on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> post-infection. no differences were observed using video otoscopy and tympanometry between the two groups in the progression of otitis media and there were no qualitative differences in the middle ear effusions . furthermore, there was no statistical difference in bacterial loads in the ear effusions recovered from the two groups .

in the fitness assays, five chinchillas were challenged with the wild type and mutant strains and disease progression was assessed on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> post-infection . over the duration of the experiment, the wild type strain produced titers normally seen in otitis media in the chinchilla following challenge with this strain
 <cit> . however, the mutant strain was unable to compete with wild type in this environment. the average competitive index  in the ten ears was approximately  <dig>  by day four  and continued to decline until day  <dig> when all ears were cleared of the mutant strain . because in vitro growth rates of mutant and wild type strains were not different in sbhi, the results of the mixed challenge suggest that the mutant’s fitness reduction is specific to the host environment.

the nontypeable strain r <dig> was compared to the hfq mutant, hi <dig>  and the ∆hfq complement strain, hi <dig>  for the ability to establish and maintain bacteremia in the infant rat model of invasive disease. virulence and fitness models of infection were also used in the infant rats. in the virulence study, two groups of  <dig> infant rats were infected with the wild type or mutant strain and disease progression was monitored by clinical signs of infection and by bacterial titers in the blood. there was no observed difference in disease progression between the two groups and there was no significant difference in the bacterial titers .

in the infant rat fitness study, two cohorts of  <dig> pups were used to compare the fitness of r <dig>  hi <dig>  and hi <dig>  one group of animals was infected with equal numbers of r <dig> and hi <dig> . the second group received the complemented strain, hi <dig>  along with hi <dig> . the last group of animals was infected with r <dig> and hi <dig> . the hfq mutant exhibited significantly lower bacteremic titers throughout the course of the experiment when compared to either the wild type or the complemented mutant strains. as shown by the competitive index, the ∆hfq strain was approximately a 100-fold lower than the wild type strain by day one and all animals had completely cleared the mutant strain by day  <dig> post infection. similar differences were observed in the animals infected with the ∆hfq complement strain and the ∆hfq strain, indicating the complement strain exhibits a reversal of the mutant phenotype, however, there was not a complete reversal of the mutant phenotype . the wild type strain did significantly out compete the complemented strain on days  <dig> and  <dig> post-infection. complementation only partially restores the in vitro growth phenotype, and since the in vivo environment is likely to be more rigorously restricted for essential nutrients, the difference between wild type and complemented strain may be exacerbated in vivo.

the role of hfq during infections of h. influenzae is not clear. in other organisms several srnas that interact with hfq have been shown to be important in the regulation of genes involved in pathogenesis
 <cit> . it is currently unknown if h. influenzae has srnas that are important in pathogenesis. however, our animal studies suggest that in the absence of hfq, certain genes important in establishing infection are likely affected. presumably, these genes are regulated by srnas either directly or indirectly and require hfq to function properly. however, during the virulence studies there was no observed difference in either animal model, indicating that the ∆hfq mutant was able to grow within the host environment. the defect is apparently limited to the occupation of specific niches within the host that are unavailable in a mixed infection due to the presence of the wild type strain. the loss of post-transcriptional regulation in the ∆hfq mutant leads to the inability of the bacteria to adapt to the host environment and compete successfully for the specific niches that are required for pathogenesis. the observations made in this study indicate there is a decrease in fitness in the animal models, and this phenotype is conserved across different strains. this effect may be partially explained by the impact of hfq mutation on acquisition of essential nutrients such as heme. while we did not address biofilm formation in the chinchilla middle ear, the possibility remains that mutation of hfq may influence adherence/biofilm formation in the microenvironment. a better understanding of the nutrients available in the host is necessary for a comprehensive explanation of the decrease in fitness identified in the mutant strain.

CONCLUSIONS
the growth and survival of pathogenic bacteria critically depends on their ability to monitor environmental changes within the host organism and adjust their own expression of stress- and virulence-associated genes accordingly. the rna chaperone hfq is important in modulating genes essential to stress and virulence in a variety of bacterial pathogens by binding srnas and their mrna target
 <cit> . our study is the first to report the role of hfq in h. influenzae and highlights the impact of hfq on nutrient acquisition in vitro and infection progression in vivo of this important human pathogen.
