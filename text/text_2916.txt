BACKGROUND
risk of human cancer associated with genetic variation at chromosome 8q <dig> was first described for prostate cancer in individuals with european ancestry and in african americans   <cit> . this association was stronger for more aggressive tumor forms  <cit>  and for earlier age at diagnosis in african americans  <cit> . differences in allele prevalences could account for the higher incidence of prostate cancer in particular populations such as african-americans  <cit> . subsequently, 8q <dig> has been associated with risk of prostate cancer by two extra independent regions  <cit>  and in risk of breast and colorectal cancer by variation partially overlapping with prostate cancer risk  <cit> . in particular, haiman et al. <cit>  first noted the existence of common risk variants for breast and colorectal cancer at 8q <dig>  these observations suggest that multiple cancer genes may exist at 8q <dig> or, alternatively, that risk variants converge on a common biological mechanism  <cit> .

in these studies risk variants did not map to known genes, with few ests identified in relatively close proximity. a proposed mechanism includes differences in genomic structure that would make the 8q <dig> region more prone to subsequent somatic amplification  <cit> . the c-myc gene is of particular interest in this region because its ectopic expression has been shown to induce prostatic neoplasia  <cit> . here, we analyze genetic and genomic data to provide evidence of 8q <dig> cis-regulator of germline c-myc transcription. in addition, genomic data modeling predicts a molecular mechanism linking germline c-myc overexpression and prostate tumorigenesis.

RESULTS
genetic association scan for germline expression differences
scanning associations between genetic variation at 8q <dig> and c-myc gene expression levels in immortalized lymphocytes of hapmap ceu  and yri  individuals showed the existence of clusters of snps with nominal p values <  <dig>  . to assess clustering significance, we examined the proportion of significant snps in genomic windows 2- or 4-fold the average size of linkage disequilibrium blocks in ceus or yris, respectively . twenty thousand permutations were performed to evaluate the significance of the observed clustering. one genomic region in ceus and three regions in yris were identified with high density of significant snps .

variation at the c-myc locus was observed with a trend in ceus, which might suggest the existence of cis-regulators in the gene structural elements . two variants in this region  are associated with germline differential expression of c-myc. the allele frequencies of these snps were reported to differ between prostate cancer cases and controls in different populations  and  <dig> %  in hawaiians;  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  in ceus for rs <dig> c)  <cit> . this observation warrants further genetic analysis of the region with regard to prostate cancer risk.

the scan revealed a possible association between variants in region  <dig> of prostate cancer risk and differential germline expression of c-myc . several significant snps within this region were identified: the most significant were rs <dig>  rs <dig> and rs <dig> . the rs <dig> a allele showed an association with c-myc overexpression in yris   <dig>  –  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ) and this snp is in low linkage disequilibrium  with the prostate cancer risk variant rs <dig> . overall, the scan analysis suggests the existence of 8q <dig> cis-regulators of germline c-myc transcription in lymphocytes, partially overlapping with region  <dig> of prostate cancer risk.

expression differences in normal prostate tissues
given the possible association of region  <dig> variants with germline c-myc overexpression in immortalized lymphocytes of hapmap individuals, we next examined expression differences in normal prostate tissues. for this analysis we used  <dig> previously characterized normal prostate tissue samples  <cit>  and a real-time qrt-pcr protocol developed for prostate samples  <cit> . genotyping the prostate cancer-associated rs <dig> variant in these samples identified six heterozygotes harboring the risk allele a . no significant age differences were found between donors harboring the two different genotypes . quantitative rt-pcr study using three gene references  identified significant c-myc overexpression in samples harboring the risk allele relative to cc homozygotes   . in addition, no evidence of allele-specific amplification in tumors arising in ca individuals was observed . these results suggest the involvement of germline c-myc overexpression in prostate cancer susceptibility.

germline copy number variants
as a possible mechanism explaining germline overexpression, we next examined copy number variants  at the c-myc locus in ceus and yris, and in  <dig> unrelated individuals from the spanish general population using a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification  assay. this assay identified genomic gains at the c-myc locus at a relatively low frequency in the spanish general population  . however, analysis of rs <dig> genotypes in these individuals did not reveal association with the risk allele and, importantly, none of the ceus or yris showed cnvs with this assay. therefore, a cnv including c-myc does not seem to be a major contributor to the risk of prostate cancer and germline c-myc overexpression associated with region  <dig>  wong et al. <cit>  previously described a cnv including c-myc but only with genomic losses. this observation corroborates the structural complexity of 8q <dig> and opens the possibility that different genomic configurations are associated with risk alleles in region  <dig> or other 8q <dig> regions.

gene expression analysis in prostate tumors
since region  <dig> variants were associated with earlier age at diagnosis and high gleason scores or aggressive tumor forms  <cit> , we examined the expression level of 8q <dig> genes in primary prostate tumors and their association with clinical and pathological variables. for these analyses, we used a publicly available expression data set containing different prostate cellular populations isolated using laser-capture microdissection  <cit> .

comparison of normal versus neoplastic samples showed differential expression of c-myc . specifically, overexpression appears in the more advanced stages of tumorigenesis such as carcinomas and hormone-refractory metastases . tomlins et al. <cit>  previously noted the identification of c-myc in an "overexpressed in progression" signature. the fam84b gene at 8q <dig> also shows overexpression but mainly at earlier stages , which suggests that fam84b could also be a target of 8q <dig> somatic amplification. analysis of gleason scores showed a trend for c-myc overexpression  . association between c-myc overexpression and high-grade prostate tumors was previously noted by buttyan et al. <cit>  and fleming et al. <cit> . these observations point to a causal relationship between somatic c-myc overexpression and the more aggressive forms of prostate tumors.

expression profiles and modeling of transcriptional regulatory networks
transcriptional targets of myc include many genes that were identified as conferring risk of prostate cancer and/or being somatically mutated in prostate tumors  <cit> . we sought to identify which of these genes, particularly those conferring risk of prostate cancer, could be functionally associated with c-myc by examining the similarity between expression profiles using a data set containing  <dig> normal tissues and  <dig> prostate tumors  <cit> . this analysis revealed strong correlations between c-myc and the prostate tumor suppressor kruppel-like factor  <dig>  gene . correlations were positive for c-myc microarray probes 1973_s_at and 37724_at  =  <dig> ; p < 10-13) and negative for 1827_s_at . extensive alternative splicing of the c-myc mrna could account for this difference  <cit> .

to determine the molecular consequence of the predicted myc-klf <dig> functional association, we generated models of transcriptional regulatory networks in prostate tissues. using the aracne algorithm  <cit>  and the  <dig> hybridizations of singh et al. <cit> , we identified  <dig> and  <dig> putative transcriptional targets of myc and klf <dig> in this cell type, respectively . the intersection of these two sets contains  <dig> genes, which is a much larger number of genes than randomly expected using simulations of equivalent gene sets . importantly,  <dig> of these genes contain myc binding sites at their promoters based on transfac  matrices  <cit> . in addition, many known myc targets  <cit>  were also identified:  <dig> out of  <dig>  and  <dig> out of  <dig>  of the myc and klf <dig> predicted transcriptional targets, respectively . notably, c-myc and klf <dig> were also directly connected and the klf <dig> promoter contains three predicted binding sites for myc . a 5-gene recurrence predictor of prostate cancer  <cit>  contains klf <dig>  three common aracne-based predictions between myc and klf <dig> , and ppfia <dig>  which is functionally related to another predicted target of klf <dig>  . these observations further support the role of klf <dig>  c-myc and the aracne-based predictions in prostate tumorigenesis.

comparison of aracne-based predictions with the tomlins et al. data set  <cit>  identified  <dig> of the  <dig> predicted myc transcriptional targets differentially expressed between normal prostate tissues and androgen-independent metastases . in addition,  <dig> of the predicted targets were found to be differentially expressed between normal prostate tissues and adenocarcinomas. notably, ~46–40% of these genes  were also predicted to be direct transcriptional targets of klf <dig> by the aracne algorithm, which endorses the putative functional association between myc and klf <dig> 

analysis of myc/myc-driven cellular transformation and tumorigenesis
to evaluate the functional significance of the predicted shared myc/klf <dig> transcriptional targets, we examined expression data derived from a model of myc-driven cellular transformation of quiescent human mammary epithelial cells and from mmtv-myc-driven mammary tumors in mice  <cit> . of the  <dig> predicted common targets,  <dig>  were found to be differentially expressed in cell transformation of quiescent human mammary epithelial cells . this proportion is ~2-fold higher than expected by chance taking into account all genes examined in the microarray platform , which substantiates the identification of true myc targets. moreover,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes contain myc binding sites at their promoters. importantly, klf <dig> was also identified and showed strong down-regulation in this model  .

analysis of mmtv-myc-driven mammary tumors in mice showed consistent results with the analysis of quiescent human mammary epithelial cells. twelve differentially expressed genes were detected, eight of which coincided with the human genes mentioned above . genes that did not overlap between the two studies showed similar trends, for example the human tgif showed a trend for down-regulation  while it was identified as significant in the study of mice tumors . importantly, this analysis also revealed klf <dig> down-regulation  . overall, the discovery of klf6/klf <dig> down-regulation in two different models of myc/myc-driven cell transformation supports the hypothesis that c-myc germline overexpression could act as a risk factor for prostate cancer by converging on a molecular mechanism such as the functional inactivation of the klf <dig> gene or gene product.

using the myc/myc-driven cell transformation models, we next examined the differential expression of known klf <dig> transcriptional targets of relevance to epithelial cancers, e-cadherin   <cit>  and p <dig>   <cit> . this analysis revealed strong down-regulation of cdh <dig> in the transformation of quiescent human mammary epithelial cells  and a trend in the model of myc-driven mice tumorigenesis . no significant differences were appreciable for cdkn1a or cdkn1a. these observations suggest that klf <dig> down-regulation mediated by germline myc overexpression could promote epithelial neoplasia by down-regulating e-cadherin.

discussion
combined analysis of genetic and expression data facilitates the identification of transcriptional regulators acting in any part of the genome  <cit> . examination of different ethnic groups reinforces the identification of these regulators but also reveals differences between populations  <cit> . due to their functional and structural complexity, transcriptional regulators are largely undercharacterized. however, it is thought that their genetic variability may be relevant when considering susceptibility to common diseases. specifically, their causal relationship to cancer is almost unknown since most genetic analyses have been focused on coding regions. insights into differential germline gene expression and tumorigenesis have been gained mainly from mice models, such as the overexpression of the ras family of genes  <cit> , mad <dig>  <cit>  or c-myc  <cit> .

this study analyzed the hypothesis that variation at 8q <dig> cis-regulator of transcription could significantly alter germline c-myc expression levels and, thus, contribute to cancer susceptibility. although the genetic scanning analysis performed is susceptible to false positives, the existence of true cis-regulator is suggested by the identification of clusters of significant snps. although larger sample series are required to draw definitive conclusions, the quantitative analysis of geneexpression in normal prostate tissues supports the model of c-myc overexpression associated with region  <dig> of prostate cancer risk. tissue-specific cis-regulator that correlate with additional cancer risk regions at 8q <dig> may also exist. in a recent study it was noted that tissue specificity is a critical factor in the transcriptional responsiveness of myc targets  <cit> .

the 8q <dig> region appears amplified in up to 50% of prostate tumors and c-myc is thought to be the primary target of these amplifications since it is overexpressed in prostate hyperplasia and neoplasia  <cit> . ectopic overexpression of c-myc/c-myc is sufficient to immortalize human prostate epithelial cells  <cit>  and has been shown to generate human-like prostate tumors in mice  <cit> . in addition, c-myc overexpression in prostate cancer cells enables androgen-independent growth  <cit> . these observations lead to suggestions of a dual role for c-myc in prostate cancer. at early stages it would promote proliferation while at later stages it would facilitate androgen-independent growth  <cit> . our study further proposes that germline c-myc overexpression may promote cellular transformation of the normal epithelium and, by extension, risk of prostate cancer by down-regulating the prostate tumor suppressor klf <dig> gene. this model is hypothetical and mainly based on the application of the aracne algorithm, which achieves a reasonable tradeoff between true- and false-positive rates by eliminating the majority of indirect interactions inferred from gene co-expression  <cit> . experimental corroboration of the predictions generated in this study is therefore needed, particularly in prostate tissues or cell lines.

the klf <dig> gene is inactivated in prostate cancer by loss of heterozygosity and/or by somatic mutations identified in tumors, cell lines and xenografts  <cit> . recent evidence has extended the role of klf <dig> inactivation to several other neoplastic processes as esophageal carcinomas  <cit> , glioblastomas  <cit> , head and neck squamous cell carcinomas  <cit> , hepatocellular carcinomas  <cit> , non-small cell lung cancer  <cit> , ovarian carcinomas  <cit>  and particularly, with regard to 8q <dig> risk variants, to colorectal cancer  <cit> . a key klf <dig> transcriptional target for epithelial neoplasia is e-cadherin , which is a suppressor of cellular invasion  <cit> . klf <dig> directly transactivates the cdh <dig> promoter resulting in increased levels of its gene product  <cit> . cdh <dig> is genetically inactivated in many human cancers and shows reduced or absent expression in approximately 50% of prostate tumors  <cit> , playing a critical role in the transition from a noninvasive to an invasive phenotype  <cit> . notably, it has recently been proposed that ephb receptors act as tumor suppressors of colorectal cancer, and possibly breast and prostate cancer, through an e-cadherin-mediated mechanism that compartmentalizes tumor cells in the initial stages of tumorigenesis  <cit> . loss of e-cadherin can result in β-catenin nuclear localization and, as a result, the up-regulation of lef/tcf-mediated transcriptional targets such as c-myc <cit> . overall, our study suggests the existence of a transcriptional regulatory circuit that is perturbed in human cancer and which begins with the germline overexpression of c-myc, causing down-regulation of klf <dig> which then reduces the transactivation of cdh <dig>  which in turns feeds c-myc expression through β-catenin and lef/tcf transcriptional complex activation.

variants at 8q <dig> have been associated with risk of prostate, breast and colorectal cancer  <cit> . although there are different blocks of linkage disequilibrium that harbor risk variants, cancer clustering might suggests the existence of a common molecular mechanism of susceptibility. expression analyses in normal prostate, breast and colorectal tissues and examination of association with genotypes are needed to determine the convergence on a common mechanism. nonetheless, tumor tissue specificity may show dependences on specific, although not fully understood, mechanisms of neoplasia. the ectopic overexpression of myc/myc in specific cell types of mice promotes breast or prostate tumorigenesis  <cit> , while widespread expression produces different types of tumors but with preferential appearance of specific epithelial and non-epithelial origins  <cit> . overexpression of c-myc also constitutes an early event after loss of the apc tumor suppressor gene that initiates colorectal cancer  <cit> . in addition, recent evidence shows that loss of heterozygosity at the klf <dig> locus contributes to the transition from the compartmentalized carcinoma to the invasive carcinoma, specifically in sporadic colorectal cancer  <cit> , which might suggest a link with the mechanism of tumor-cells compartmentalization in the initial stages of tumorigenesis mediated by e-cadherin  <cit> . although the predictions generated in this study should be treated with a degree of caution, these observations would agree with the hypothesis of a cancer susceptibility mechanism mediated by c-myc germlineoverexpression.

CONCLUSIONS
this study proposes that variation at putative 8q <dig> cis-regulator of transcription can significantly alter germline c-myc expression levels and, thus, contribute to prostate cancer susceptibility by down-regulating the prostate tumor suppressor klf <dig> gene. we propose a transcriptional regulatory model perturbed in human cancer with a feedback loop for c-myc.
