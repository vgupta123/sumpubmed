BACKGROUND
gene co-expression analyses can reveal functional relationships between gene products. these types of relationships are typically explored using some type of similarity measure, e.g. pearson’s correlation coefficient , to quantify the association between two genes in the genome. the pairwise relationships can be represented as a network structure, in which edges  connect nodes  that generally include the majority of genes in a given organism’s genome
 <cit> . based on these associations, it is possible to predict functional gene clusters, or groups of genes, that participate in common biological pathways
 <cit> . moreover, this approach may also be used to find the conserved orthologous gene clusters across several species
 <cit> , with the implication that the clusters are involved in similar biological processes.

many co-expression networks have been constructed in plants, such as arabidopsis
, barley
 <cit> , rice
 <cit> , poplar
 <cit> , tobacco
 <cit> , and maize
 <cit> . several of these efforts have been implemented as web-based tools, e.g. the arabidopsis co-expression toolkit 
 <cit> , atted-ii
 <cit> , atcoecis
 <cit> , ricearraynet 
 <cit> , co-expressed biological processes  database
 <cit> , the gene co-expression network browser
 <cit> , and two aranets
 <cit> , and planet
 <cit> .

while the co-expression-based approaches have proved successful for several biological processes, far from all cellular aspects can rely on this type of metrics. instead, integrative approaches are increasingly applied to extend knowledge gleaned from one type of dataset. these studies are typically relying on functional and structural genomics data, such as high-throughput microarray assays, next-generation sequencing, and metabolomic and proteomic technologies
 <cit> .

plant cell walls are mainly composed of cellulose, non-cellulosic polysaccharides  and lignin, and represent the most abundant renewable biomass on earth
 <cit> . the primary and secondary cell walls are typically distinct structures in plant growth and development
 <cit> , where the primary wall is a flexible matrix that allows directed cell growth and the secondary wall is a robust structure surrounding cells that need extra support for their functions. in general, cellulose makes up almost 25-30% of dry matter in grasses
 <cit>  and 40-45% in woody plants
 <cit> . hemicelluloses are polysaccharides that contain xyloglucans, xylans, mannans and glucomannans, and β--glucans, whereas pectins are diversified compounds that mainly are present in primary walls
 <cit> . lastly, the polyphenolic molecule lignin is an amorphous polymer of phenylpropane units with three monomers: p-hydroxyphenyl , guaiacyl , and syringyl 
 <cit> , laid down during secondary wall formation.

more than one thousand gene products have been proposed to be dedicated to plant cell wall biogenesis and modification
. during the past years, characterization of plant cell wall mutants has revealed dozens of genes involved in cell wall synthesis and modification
. however, the functions of the majority of cell wall related genes remain obscure, in particular in plant species other than the main model organism arabidopsis.

rice  is one of the most important food crops worldwide and serves as a model plant for cereal genomic research
 <cit> . genomic resources in rice have developed rapidly in recent years, in part due to the high quality genome sequence. genome-wide expression data of  <dig> tissue/organs covering the life cycle of rice has been obtained and deposited in the public database
 <cit> . to date, most insights into cell wall related properties of rice have been obtained through the characterization of mechanical strength change in stems in forward genetic screens
 <cit> . these studies have revealed some mechanistic aspects of cell wall biosynthesis and identified the affected genes in rice
 <cit> . however, genetic screens are usually quite involved, and a more rapid way of inferring relationships between gene products and cell wall characteristics would certainly be advantageous. in this study, we concentrated on establishing a platform that combines transcriptomic associations with cell wall characteristics to infer processes that are connected to cell wall biosynthesis and re-modeling in rice.

RESULTS
data integration and network construction
to construct the rice gene co-expression network, microarray datasets from  <dig> tissues, covering almost the whole life cycle of rice, were initially collected from crep . after data quality control and removal of non-specific binding probes, a total of  <dig>  probe sets were used for mapping to the tigr database using the nipponbare genome sequence as reference. this resulted in  <dig>  probe sets each having at least six perfect match probes mapped as unique genes, and thus termed by the corresponding genes. as expression for any given gene is measured by multiple probes , we summarized the information using r function collapserows
 <cit> . the resulting expression matrix contained  <dig>  genes or probe sets. to be able to statistically compare the expression matrix to the cell wall data, we decided to construct a weighted correlation network
 <cit>  based on the  <dig>  probes for the  <dig> tissues that we also used for cell wall analyses. here, the weights of edges in the corresponding co-expression network correspond to the degree of similarity of the expression profiles of two adjacent nodes/genes.

subsequently, a clustering approach of the weighted correlation network was undertaken, which resulted in  <dig> groups of highly co-expressed genes, also referred to as gene modules . hence, modules were defined as groups of genes which exhibit a high intra-module topological overlap
 <cit> . the modules were denoted by numbers from zero to  <dig> and prefixed with “me” referring to “module eigengene”
 <cit> . obviously, the numbers of genes  per module differed, and more than half of the modules contained less than  <dig> genes  . to explore the co-expression relationships between modules, a module’s representative expression pattern was summarized using the first principal component of all the module’s gene members. further, all module eigengenes were clustered by using complete linkage method , which characterizes the similarity structure between the modules.

biological relevance and connectivity scores of network modules
to assess the functional relevance of the gene modules, and to make sure that the co-expressed modules reflect biologically relevant information, we next examined whether certain ontology terms were over-represented in the modules. gene ontology  enrichment analysis was therefore performed using a weighted method and fisher’s exact test
 <cit>  . the analysis showed that a total of  <dig>  enriched terms and  <dig>  unique terms were identified among the modules at p <  <dig> . notably, a significant over-representation of the terms cellulose and non-cellulosic polysaccharide biosynthesis was observed for module  <dig>  and module  <dig>  . based on the representation of kegg reference pathway maps and brite functional hierarchies
 <cit> , we furthermore performed a functional enrichment analysis of kegg orthology for each module using hypergeometric tests. module  <dig> and module  <dig> were enriched in glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, consistent with the findings that genes in module  <dig> and module  <dig> may participate in cellulose and non-cellulosic biosynthesis as observed in the go enrichment analysis. detailed significant associations for each module are supplied in additional file
 <dig> 

highly connected genes, or hubs, are thought to play a central role in biological networks. connectivity has been found as an important complementary gene screening variable for finding biologically significant genes in particular biological processes
 <cit> . intramodular connectivity  is defined as the gene connectivity inside a given module. in weighted networks, intramodular connectivity equals the sum of connection weights of a node with all other nodes inside module. in this study, we defined whole network connectivity ktotal, and external module connectivity  for any given node. to find genes of high connectivity  in consensus modules, we evaluated the module eigengene-based connectivity  as the correlation between the gene expression and the module eigengene
 <cit> . we also calculated all connectivity types in all models, and the genes sorted out by their kme were listed in additional file
 <dig> 

cell wall composition analysis
in an attempt to assign certain cell wall related functions to the modules, we harvested material from the  <dig> tissues that corresponded to the microarray data sets above. we sequentially extracted wall polysaccharides including pectin with ammonium oxalate, hemicelluloses with koh, and cellulose in the remaining pellet
 <cit> . the pectin was present at very low levels, or absent, in most rice tissues, and we therefore did not use the pectin data for any further investigation in this work. in summary, the cell wall composition varied greatly across the  <dig> tissues . cellulose content ranged from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % of dry matter  . three major monosaccharides of hemicelluloses also varied significantly
 <cit> , with xylose  levels ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>  mg/g , arabinose  levels ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>  mg/g , and galactose  levels ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>  mg/g  . the main constituents of lignin, i.e. the h, g and s monolignols, also showed major changes among tissues; p-hydroxyphenyl  levels varied from  <dig>   to  <dig>  μmol/g , guaiacyl  ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  μmol/g  and syringyl  ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  μmol/g  . hence, the plant cell wall composition displayed major differences across the different rice tissues.figure  <dig> 
cell wall content varies across rice tissues. a. to d. cellulose and three monosaccharides  of hemicelluloses were estimated in  <dig> rice tissues.
monolignol content across rice tissues. three monolignols of  <dig> tissues in rice were measured. these were p-hydroxybenzaldehyde , vanillin  and syringaldehyde .



to assess the degree of correlation of the cell wall components across the tissues, we performed a correlation analysis of the glucose of cellulose, monosaccharides of hemicelluloses and monomers of lignin . interestingly, cellulose was significantly positively correlated with xyl  and the three monolignols  with student asymptotic p-value at p <  <dig> , whereas ara and gal exhibited a significant positive correlation  at p <  <dig> . notably, the three monolignols were also positively correlated to each other  at p <  <dig> . these data suggest that certain cell wall components are produced in a coordinated fashion in rice.

connecting module eigenvectors and cell wall datasets
to investigate the associations between the co-expressed gene modules and the cell wall composition we conducted correlation analyses between the previously derived module representative eigengenes and the cell wall composition data using pcc .figure  <dig>

 <dig> 



a cell wall related process that has extensively been used for co-expression analyses is secondary wall synthesis
 <cit> . as this process also should be associated with distinct cell wall characteristics, i.e. cellulose, xylan and lignin, we first investigated whether such patterns were evident from our cell wall analyses, and secondly, if these characteristics correlated positively with any modules. notably, module  <dig> displayed a significantly positive correlation with cellulose, xylose, and h and s monolignols , suggesting that the module plays a major role in the synthesis of these components. strikingly, the genes contained in module  <dig> included cellulose synthases , oscobra, chitinase-like  and other genes that have been assigned to cellulose biosynthesis 
 <cit> . furthermore, several of the genes included in this module have been obtained via forward genetic screens for brittle culms, such as osbc <dig>  osbc <dig>  osbc11
 <cit> . based on these observations, and the fact that the closest homologs for many of the genes in this module are involved in secondary wall formation in arabidopsis, we assumed that module  <dig> is associated with secondary wall synthesis. these data were supported by the fact that the rice orthologs of the nac transcription factor  snd <dig>  and the myb tfs, atmyb <dig> , atmyb52/ <dig> , atmyb58/ <dig>  and atmyb <dig>  were included in this module. these tfs have been shown to regulate secondary wall deposition in arabidopsis
. surprisingly, the two well-known secondary wall tfs  were found in modules  <dig> and  <dig>  although these modules did not show any significant correlation with cell wall polymers in this study, both modules are in close vicinity of modules  <dig> and  <dig>  indicative of their role in cell wall formation
 <cit> . several genes were identified for glucuronoxylan biosynthesis, such as the rice homologs for atirx14l 
 <cit> , atirx15l 
 <cit> , and the rice xylosyltransferase osgt61- <dig> 
 <cit>  in module  <dig>  the strong positive correlation between the module eigengene and the cell wall content, which typified secondary wall content, supports that our combined large-scale dataset strategy is useful in obtaining meaningful biological information.in an attempt to assess how the cell wall characteristics were globally distributed over the co-expressed modules, we color-coded the cell wall-related clades obtained in the dendrogram in figure 
 <dig> . figure 
 <dig> shows that the different cell wall characteristics nicely groups together in a module meta-network, i.e. a network that displays the co-expression relationships between the modules. these data corroborate that certain groups of co-expressed modules may be linked to distinct cell wall features. for example, the purple well-grouped modules typically correlate with high levels of galactose and arabinose .figure  <dig>

module  <dig> genes participate in primary cell wall cellulose formation
based on the go enrichment analysis, module  <dig> was also identified as likely to be associated with cellulose biosynthesis . notably, many genes for primary wall cellulose biosynthesis were included in this module , such as oscesa <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  oscslf <dig> and oscobra
 <cit> . interestingly, orthologous genes to the once associated with xylan backbone elongation in arabidopsis
 <cit>  were also identified in module  <dig>  including atirx <dig> , atirx9l , atirx <dig>  and atirx <dig> . here, it is important to bear in mind that the rice primary walls, in contrast to arabidopsis, contain large amounts of glucuronoarabinoxylan. curiously, four lignin biosynthesis related genes were also found in this module, i.e. osccr1/irx <dig> 
 <cit> , osccomt , os4cl <dig> , and oscomt . one possible explanation for this is that the co-expressed gene vicinities for primary and secondary wall synthesis are more closely connected in monocots than in dicots 
 <cit> . hence, it is plausible that the lignin related genes in module  <dig>  which represent rather early steps in the lignin biosynthesis, represent connecting elements between the primary and secondary wall production. importantly, arabidopsis homologs for several tfs contained in module  <dig> have been reported to regulate plant cell wall formation in arabidopsis
, including atmyb <dig> , atmyb <dig> , anac073/snd <dig>  and atvnd <dig> . in addition, loc_os03g <dig> and loc_os04g <dig> are also present in this module and correspond most closely with anac <dig> and anac <dig> in arabidopsis. although, these tfs have not been associated with cell wall formation previously they may represent interesting candidates for such functions. intriguingly, several of the tfs in this module typically regulate features associated with secondary wall synthesis, corroborating a close connection between primary and secondary wall synthesis in grasses. as module  <dig> is significantly correlated with cellulose and other non-cellulosic cell wall monomers, and given that several orthologs correlate with primary wall cellulose synthesis in arabidopsis, we conclude that module  <dig> is enriched for primary wall cellulose related functions.

module association with other cell wall characteristics
the cell wall content and gene co-expression supported a role for the genes in modules  <dig> and  <dig> in cellulose synthesis during primary and secondary wall synthesis, respectively. these findings are consistent with previous findings
 <cit> . this also suggests that the cell wall characteristics for a module may be complementary to the co-expression approach to assign function for the module. we therefore argued that other modules that have tight positive correlation with certain cell wall characteristics  can be assigned to such functions with the additional aid of co-expression. several modules are strongly associated with specific cell wall characteristics, including modules  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  module  <dig> has a strong positive correlation with ara and gal cell wall content , but little is known about the function of the genes associated with this module. to first investigate whether the genes included in the module are associated with cell wall synthesis or modifications, we analyzed the genes for mapman ontology term associations
 <cit> . figure 
 <dig> shows a pie chart of significant mapman terms associated with module  <dig>  interestingly, the term cell wall was among the most highly enriched terms for the genes included in the module. more specifically, the term hemicellulose synthesis was highly significantly enriched  as was the term cell wall modification . these terms corresponds very well with the positive correlation of the module with gal and ara content, which are typically found associated with hemicelluloses in grass species. moreover, when we investigated the annotation of the genes included in module  <dig>  we discovered that many of the genes were associated with glycosyltransferase and other cell wall annotation, including expansin , endoglucanse  and peroxidase  activities. more specifically, we found that many xyloglucan associated functions, including xyloglucan galactosyltransferase , fucosyltransferase , and cslc3-cellulose synthase-like  families, where present in the module. while xyloglucan is not a prominent wall component in grasses, it is likely that these genes play important functions in hemicellulose synthesis in these species. also, as ara and gal are two major monosaccharides branched in xylans in grasses
 <cit> , the ara and gal substitution degrees could be determinants in hemicellulosic structures. in addition, expansins are typically associated with modifying interactions between hemicelluloses and cellulose, and therefore induce extensibility in the wall matrix. hence, it appears likely that many of the components included in module  <dig> would have a direct influence on the formation and modification of hemicellulose polymers and interactions.

module  <dig> was, similar to module  <dig>  also significantly positively correlated with ara and gal content . similar to analyses done for module  <dig>  we investigated the genes in module  <dig> for significant mapman ontology enrichments . from this analysis it became evident that terms like cell wall degradation was prominent . in particular, many glycosyl hydrolases, such as osgh <dig> , osgh <dig> , osgh <dig> , osgh <dig>  and osgh <dig>  are part of this module. similar to module  <dig>  we also found several expansin genes, including loc_os05g <dig>  loc_os07g <dig>  and loc_os10g <dig>  these data support a role in cell wall modification and degradation for module  <dig>  to analyze the associations between the module components and the cell wall content a bit more in detail, we calculated pcc between the genes, or probes, with the cell wall components and student asymptotic p-values. the more likely candidate genes were sorted out based on the correlative coefficient p values relatively lower than 75% of all student asymptotic p-values according to cell wall component. as a result, a subgroup of  <dig> genes from module  <dig> showed a high correlation with ara level and another subgroup of  <dig> genes correlated significantly with gal content . notably, another  <dig> genes in module  <dig> that were not part of the two previous subgroups displayed a correlation with both ara and gal  levels. notably, several osgh <dig> family members have recently been identified with a role in cellulose crystallinity modification
 <cit> , and the ara substitution degree of xylans in miscanthus displays a significantly negative correlation with the cellulose crystalline index
 <cit> . perhaps these relationships are also reflected in the module  <dig> correlation with ara. taken together, it is plausible that the genes in module  <dig> could be associated with cell wall modification and degradation of cell wall polymers, particularly concerning hemicelluloses. while the module included several cell wall related genes, most notably glucanses, most of the other genes have not previously been associated with cell wall related functions. we find it likely that these genes might reflect underlying growth programs that need to be coordinated with cell wall modifications. these relationships will certainly be interesting to explore in more detail in the future.

module  <dig> displayed a significantly positive correlation with cellulose, xyl, and h or s, which is similar to module  <dig> . however, the majority of genes contained in this module have not been associated with cell wall synthesis or modification yet. to investigate the potential function in cell wall formation process of genes or probes included in this module, we also performed a correlation analysis between the genes or probes with the cell wall components  and calculated the student asymptotic p-values. we then sorted the p-values calculated between genes or probes expression values with the cell wall components, individually. genes or probes got lower p-values than 75% of all student asymptotic p-values calculated were screened out as candidate genes according to the cell wall components. the selected genes were then classified into ten groups. a subgroup of six genes exhibited a high correlation with cellulose, while another subgroup that held seven genes correlated significantly with xylose . another four genes that were not found in the previous subgroups exhibited a correlation with both cellulose and xyl levels , suggesting a potential role for the corresponding gene products in wall synthesis or modification. in addition, a nac tf  was associated with subgroup multi which may play multiple roles in cell wall synthesis or modification. as nac tfs have been reported as key regulators of secondary cell wall synthesis in arabidopsis
 <cit> , we propose that the osnac gene may similarly play a regulatory role in the cell wall networks associated with module  <dig>  hence, our data suggested that module  <dig> may participate in re-organization of the cell wall.

furthermore,  <dig> genes in module  <dig> were highly correlated with g-monolignols based on the student asymptotic p-values calculated between the g content with the expression values of genes, or probes . however, none of these genes encode the enzymes involved in the lignin biosynthesis pathways
 <cit> . notably, the osmyb <dig> tf  of this module corresponds to the arabidopsis myb tf at3g <dig>  . this tf has been identified as an activator of secondary wall thickening
 <cit> . hence, we hypothesize that module  <dig> may be involved in the regulation of secondary cell walls, in particular for the production of g-rich lignification.

to further find more complex associations between gene modules represented by their eigengenes and cell wall properties, we used canonical correlation analysis . cca is a multivariate statistical technique employed for studying associations between two sets of variables
 <cit> , which are represented as two matrices x and y. instead of analyzing pair-wise similarities of individual variables as it is the case for pearson’s correlation coefficient, cca finds two linear combinations for each of the two matrices x and y, which are maximally correlated and was used here to find association between cell wall related measurements and modules of transcripts represented by eigengenes.

clear similarities resulting from the cca between eigengenes and cell wall properties are visualized in a relevance network . here, cell wall related features are represented as circles, while eigengenes are depicted by  rectangles. an edge between a circle and a hexagon illustrates an association found by cca .again, modules  <dig> and  <dig> are clearly related to each other  and are associated with typical secondary wall traits, such as lignin monomers, cellulose and xylose . several modules are also positively associated with galactose, including the modules  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  perhaps indicative of some primary wall hemicellulose synthesis and plant growth as indicated above. interestingly, module  <dig> showed a negative association with several cell wall traits, including xylose, arabinose, cellulose and g lignin monomers . this could perhaps indicate that the genes associated with this module negatively regulate the deposition of cell walls in general.figure  <dig> 
a model on the module network for cell wall metabolomics. central modules  <dig> exhibited a dominant function on cellulose biosynthesis from primary to secondary cell wall formation, followed with the module  <dig> involved in re-organization of cell wall; modules  <dig> and  <dig> displayed a distinct modification in hemicellulosic formation and degradation; cell wall related features are represented as circles, while eigengenes are depicted by  rectangles. an edge between a circle and a hexagon illustrates an association found by cca .



CONCLUSIONS
we integrated transcriptomic associations and cell wall metabolism for  <dig> rice tissues and found that certain co-expressed gene modules are positively correlated with distinct cell wall characteristics. in addition to confirmatory relationships, i.e. that primary and secondary wall gene modules were correlated with cellulose synthesis, cell wall related characteristics for several other modules could be inferred. based on these relationships we propose a draft network for cell wall metabolomics . this framework may lie as a foundation for cell wall transcriptional regulatory and biosynthesis network in monocots and beyond. it is important to note that these inferences would have been difficult to achieve by simply looking at co-expression alone. we therefore propose that combining multiple data-types, such as coordinated transcription and cell wall analyses, may be a useful approach to glean new insight into biological processes.
