BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a family of ~22nt endogenous non-coding rnas  <cit> . mature mirnas are usually cleaved from ~90nt mirna precursors  which are derived from processing of a long primary mirna  by a ribonucluease  <cit> . increasing evidences have shown that mirnas play fundamentally important roles in various biological processes, including cell proliferation  <cit> , development timing  <cit> , apoptosis  <cit> , carcinogenesis  <cit> , and response to different environmental stresses containing disease  <cit> .

since the first lin- <dig> mirna of c. elegans was discovered in  <dig>  <cit> , more than  <dig> mirnas have been found in animals and plants. currently, the mirna registry database , a comprehensive and searchable database of published mirna sequences, contains  <dig> entries representing hairpin pre-mirnas, expressing  <dig> mature mirna products, in  <dig> species  <cit> . however, only  <dig> pre-mirnas of pigs are included in this database, the number is far less than it really has.

pre-mirnas have similar hairpin-shaped stem loop structure, high minimal folding free energy index, and high evolutionary conservation. they become the important features which could be used in the computational identification of pre-mirna  <cit> . to date, computational prediction has been broadly used to identify potential pre-mirnas in animals and plants  <cit> , because it is not limited by tissue specificity and time of mirna expression. especially, machine learning approaches such as random forest   <cit> , naïve bayes classifier  <cit> , hidden markov model  <cit>  and svm  <cit>  have been adopted.

although previous studies have identified a certain number of porcine pre-mirnas, few researches in computational identification of pre-mirnas based on the whole genome sequences are being done. furthermore, most of the machine learning approaches are based on the data sets of human, while the features of the pre-mirnas also exhibit the species-specificity. therefore, we are aimed to identify the porcine pre-mirna in genome-wide through computational approaches by utilizing the data sets of pigs in our study, which may provide us a global scanning on the pre-mirnas of pigs in genome level. in our study, we built the svm-based porcine pre-mirnas classifier with a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of  <dig> % and a total prediction accuracy of  <dig> %, respectively. as a result,  <dig> and  <dig> porcine pre-mirna candidates were separately detected by using svm-based pre-mirnas classifier and homology searching.

RESULTS
performance of the svm-based pre-mirnas classifier
svm-based porcine pre-mirnas classifier was built by using the data sets of pigs. interestingly, all of porcine pre-mirnas of the test set were correctly detected by our classifier, which achieved a sensitivity  of 100%, a specificity  of  <dig> % and a total prediction accuracy  of  <dig> %, respectively. the power of the pre-mirnas classifier was given in table  <dig>  moreover, the performance of the classifier was also tested by a roc curve. as shown in the figure  <dig>  the classifier achieved a five-fold cross-validation rate of  <dig> %. in a word, it indicated that our classifier was available for the prediction of porcine pre-mirnas. additionally, it also demonstrated that the comprehensive use of the pre-mirnas features of the secondary structure and sequence information was an effective strategy in pre-mirnas prediction.


test set represents positive and negative set used to test the power of the pre-mirnas classifier. type represents the classification of the test set. size is the number of the real or pseudo pre-mirnas contained in test set. accuracy is the percentage of the real or pseudo correctly recognized by pre-mirnas classifier.

xue et al. obtained an accuracy of 90% by using a set of features combining the local contiguous structures with sequence information to distinct the pre-mirnas with that of pseudo pre-mirnas  <cit> , and those features have been used by several other pre-mirna predicting methods  <cit> . their studies demonstrated that those features were effective in pre-mirna prediction. thus, we also adopted those features in our study. later, jiang et al. found that the predicting performance significantly increased by combining the minimum of free energy  of the secondary structure or p-value feature with the local contiguous triplet structure composition feature. their results indicated that a comprehensive feature vector was able to extract more information of a primary sequence and reach a better prediction performance  <cit> . our classifier was capable of achieving a well prediction performance with an accuracy of  <dig> % may be due to the using of a combined feature vector, because additional seven features used in our study have been proved to be one part of the optimized features subset in pre-mirnas prediction by wang et al.  <cit> .

identification of pre-mirnas candidates on pig genome using the svm-based classifier
since the genome sequences contain the full information of a species and the database of non-coding rna of pigs is quite incompletely, thus we used whole genome sequences to construct the prediction set . after splitting the pig genome, we obtained more than  <dig> million short sequences. the pr-s constructed by short sequences passed by pre-filter was further distinguished by our svm-based pre-mirnas classifier. as pre-filter parameters would be very useful in filtering the pseudo pre-mirnas from huge number of similar pre-mirna sequences, those pre-filters were incorporated into the svm-based classifier to predict novel pre-mirnas. except for the redundancy and the known pre-mirnas, we finally got  <dig> pre-mirna candidates with the probability more than  <dig>  in the pig genome. they were formed into  <dig> clusters according to their locations in genome wide . those pre-mirna candidates were blasted with porcine cds and other non-coding rna . the result shown that  <dig> novel pre-mirnas  overlap with coding region. namely,  <dig> out of  <dig> new pre-mirnas are in the non-coding region. and none of pre-mirnas  were found that overlap with other non-coding rnas. the procedure for predicting porcine pre-mirnas was given as figure  <dig> 


the large number of the novel pre-mirna candidates indicated that there were still many unidentified pre-mirnas in pigs. previous studies estimated that the number of mirnas have taken up to approximately 2-3% of the total number of genes in animal genomes  <cit> . according to our study, the number of the pre-mirnas would be more than previous estimate. expression profiling studies showed that most mirnas were under the control of tissue-specific and development signaling, or both  <cit> . as a result, it may lead to a less number of mirna identified by experimental methods and a low evaluate of pre-mirnas’ number. indeed, in our studies, we regarded those pre-mirna candidates as the real porcine pre-mirnas in the view of bioinformatics. meanwhile, those pre-mirna candidates were set up to the porcine pre-mirna library, the detail information of which was given in additional file  <dig> 

to explore the location distribution of all the pre-mirna candidates, we calculated the number of pre-mirna candidates in each chromosome. and the chromosome  <dig> covered the maximum number of pre-mirnas candidates, while the chromosome  <dig> included the minimum. to a large extent, the number was consistent with the length of chromosome, namely the bigger of the chromosome the more number of pre-mirna candidates it contained. the density analysis of pre-mirna in chromosome showed that chromosome x,  <dig> and  <dig> maintained the highest density of pre-mirna. the chromosome  <dig> was also found that it had a high density of quantitative trait locus  . thus, the result suggested other researchers should pay more attention to study the chromosome  <dig> of pigs in the future. the result of density analysis of pre-mirna and qtl in chromosome was given in additional file  <dig> 

at the same time,  <dig> unique pre-mirnas were identified in pigs by solexa sequencing in another published study  <cit> . based on the comparison this data with ours, we found that  <dig>  of above  <dig> unique pre-mirnas were included in our study. in chen et al.’s study, it mainly focused on identifying mirnas in porcine backfat tissues. tissues-specificity may lead to a bias on much more number of mirnas identified in backfat tissues in their study, meanwhile some of their candidate mirnas were unidentified by our method due to a limited length of 90-nt changed their features in our study. these may count for the low overlap rate. however, the result of chen et al.’s study may still provide a piece of experimental evidence for our study. after the step of pre-filtering, a total of  <dig> known pre-mirnas were retained in pr-s.  <dig> sequence fragments  represented  <dig> known pre-mirnas were detected by classifier. namely, the sequence fragments of the known pre-mirnas in the pr-s could be detected with the coverage of 72% . the details those known pre-mirnas sequence fragments were given in additional file  <dig>  there are several possible reasons accounting for that not all the reported porcine pre-mirnas in mirna registry database were covered in our studies. firstly, not all the pre-mirna sequences are expressed in the order of the genome sequence due to the rna editing  <cit>  , such as mir- <dig> mir- <dig>  according to our observation,  <dig> out of known  <dig> pre-mirnas are completely identical to the sequence of the genome, thus  <dig> known pre-mirna sequences unmapped to the genomic sequence data were filtered. secondly, in order to reduce the pseudo pre-mirnas as more as possible, the pre-filter parameters setting is up to some reported pre-mirnas, such as the value of the minimal folding free energy index .  <dig> out of  <dig> known pre-mirnas were retained  after this step. thirdly, the length of the short sequence is limited to 90-nt, while some features of pre-mirnas ) and the adjust number of paired nucleotides ) have connection with the sequence length  <cit> , which may influence the features of  <dig> reported pre-mirnas and lead them to be undetected.

although the classifier produced a specificity of  <dig> %, the candidate hairpins could be lead to a certain number of false positives in genome-wide prediction. thus, the next problem removing those pseudo pre-mirnas in the library is needed to be considered deeply.

identification of the pre-mirnas candidates using the homologous searching
since the pre-mirna candidate sequences were split from genome with a specified length of 90-nt which may lead some of them undetected by our svm classifier and the coverage of some model species with our svm-based classifier result  were 8% , 12% , 22% , 16%  and 31% , which was not so high. the svm-based classifier’s training set was composed by the porcine known pre-mirnas to predict the novel pre-mirnas of pigs. the feature of pre-mirnas exhibits the species-specificity. it may cause our svm-based classifier have some biases to detect more pre-mirna possessed only by pigs. the species-specificity and homologous porcine pre-mirnas unidentified in model species may contribute to the low overlap rate. it was necessary to make it up by some other computational methods. at present, besides the svm classifier the homologous searching is also a widely used method for identifying the pre-mirnas, because the pre-mirnas have a highly conservation among the different species  <cit> . what’s more, in recent years, a large number of new pre-mirnas were identified in some model species, such as mouse, human. up to now, according to the records of mirna registry database , it contains human , mouse , rat , cow  and dog . while, there are only  <dig> pre-mirnas in pig. therefore, it is quite necessary for us to do a homologous searching once again to find the new pre-mirnas of porcine by using the identified pre-mirnas in the other species.

according to the criteria mentioned in homologous searching method, we found  <dig> new pre-mirnas candidates, and the detail information of which was given in additional file  <dig>  interestingly, some pre-mirnas candidates were mapped to more than one location of chromosomes. guo et al. thought that cross-mapping events in pre-mirnas revealed potential mirna-mimics and evolutionary implications  <cit> . the newly identified porcine pre-mirnas candidates belong to different mirna families, such as mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  among them, mir- <dig> initially identified from melanoma  <cit>  and mir- <dig> from human cervical cancer and normal cervices  <cit>  have a highly conservation with pigs. we have also compared this result with the svm-based and found no overlap between them. actually, there were some of them passing svm model before filtering in our study. however, when the prediction probability was set as more than  <dig>  to reduce false positive, they were filtered out with a result of no overlap between homology search and svm-model candidates. there is no doubt that the high conservation of pre-mirnas among the species also provides us a rapid way to identify the pig pre-mirnas. this would be helpful to further enrich the resource of pre-mirnas databases.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we built the svm-based pre-mirnas classifier using the known pre-mirnas and cds sets of the pigs. from the porcine genome, we discovered  <dig> new pre-mirnas candidates by our svm-based classifier and  <dig> pre-mirnas candidates by homology searching. our study would provide guidance on further experimentally verifying swine pre-mirna in the future and offer the opportunity to research gene function and the genetic mechanism of complex traits in genome level.
