BACKGROUND
being unable to move, plants have developed a series of complex mechanisms to cope with abiotic and biotic stresses. recognition of stress cues and transduction of signals to activate adaptive responses and regulation of stress-related genes are key steps leading to plant stress tolerance .

due to the potential impact on agricultural production much attention has been focused on abiotic stress factors. abiotic stresses initiate the synthesis of different types of proteins, including transcription factors, enzymes, molecular chaperones, ion channels, and transporters  <cit> . transcriptional regulation mechanisms play a critical role in plant development and responses to environmental stimuli  <cit> . transcription factors, with specific dna-binding domains  and trans-acting functional domains, can combine with specific dna sequences to activate or inhibit transcription of downstream genes. using transcription factors to improve the tolerance of plants to abiotic stresses is a promising strategy due to the ability of transcription factors to modulate a set of genes through binding to either promoter or enhancer region of a gene  <cit> . overexpression of constitutive active dreb2a which had a transcriptional activation domain between residues  <dig> and  <dig> resulted in significant drought stress tolerance through regulates expression of many water stress-inducible genes  <cit> . in our previous study, gmhsf- <dig> gene improved drought and heat stresses tolerance in arabidopsis plants  <cit> . these studies indicate the potential for improvement of abiotic stress tolerance in plants through transcriptional regulation.

wrky transcription factors, one of the ten largest transcription factor families, are characterized by a highly conserved wrkygqk heptapeptide at the n-terminus and a zinc finger-like motif at the c-terminus  <cit> . conservation of the wrky domain is mirrored by a remarkable conservation of its cognate binding site, the w box  . a few wrky proteins which show slight variations in the heptapeptide wrkygqk motif can not bind the w box and may bind the wk box  . wrkys are divided into three groups based on the number of wrky domains and type of zinc finger motif. the first group has two wrky domains. groups ii and iii have a single wrky domain and are distinguished according to the type of zinc finger motif  <cit> . groups i and ii share the same c2h <dig> zinc finger motif whereas group iii contains a c2-hc-type motif  <cit> . later, according to a more accurate phylogenetic analysis, zhang and wang divided wrky factors into groups i, iia + iib, iic, iid + iie, and iii with group ii genes not being monophyletic  <cit> .

increasing data indicates that wrky genes are rapidly induced by pathogen infection and exogenous phytohormones . forty nine of  <dig> arabidopsis wrky genes were differentially regulated after infection by pseudomonas syringae or sa treatment  <cit> . transcript abundance of  <dig> canola wrky genes changed after pathogen infection  <cit> . similarly,  <dig> grape wrky genes showed various transcription expression in response to biotic stress caused by grape white rot and/or salicylic acid . among them  <dig> wrky genes were upregulated by both pathogenic white rot bacteria and sa, indicating that these wrky genes participated in the sa-dependent defense signal pathway  <cit> . heterologous expression of oswrky <dig> activated defense-related genes and enhanced resistance to pathogens in arabidopsis  <cit> . recently, it was reported that the osmkk4-osmpk3/osmpk <dig> cascade regulates transactivation activity of oswrky <dig>  and a phospho-mimic mutant of oswrky <dig> resulted in further-enhanced disease resistance against the blast fungus in rice compared to native oswrky <dig>  <cit> .

in comparison with research progress on biotic stresses, the functions of wrkys in abiotic stresses are far less known . increasing numbers of reports are showing that wrkys respond to abiotic stress and abscisic acid  signaling in plants . several arabidopsis wrky genes can be induced by drought and/or cold stress  <cit> . atwrky <dig> regulated osmotic stress responses and stomatal movement independently in arabidopsis  <cit> . oswrky <dig> improved the osmotic stress tolerance of transgenic arabidopsis through positive regulation of the expression of aba-independent abiotic stress responsive genes  <cit> . overexpression and rnai analysis demonstrated that gmwrky <dig> improved salt and drought tolerance in transgenic soybean hairy roots by inhibits expression of a downstream gene gmnac <dig> which was a negative factor of stress tolerance  <cit> . therefore, wrkys play a broad-spectrum regulatory role as positive and negative regulators in response to biotic and abiotic stresses, senescence, seed development and seed germination  <cit> .

drought stress is one of the most severe environmental factors restricting crop distribution and production. the molecular mechanisms underlying plant tolerance to drought stress are still not fully understood because of the complex nature  <cit> . bread wheat  is one of the most widely cultivated and important food crops in the world. drought affects growth and productivity of wheat, and reduces yields worldwide. it was recently reported that wheat tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> conferred tolerance to drought stress in transgenic plants  <cit> . to investigate putative drought-mediated wrky genes, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing of drought-treated wheat, and identified  <dig> wheat drought-responsive wrky genes. we further investigated stress tolerance conferred by tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> in transgenic arabidopsis. the present study investigated the possibility of improving stress tolerance in plants by screening stress responsive candidate genes.

to investigate the evolutionary relationships of the drought-induced wheat wrkys with previously reported wrkys, a phylogenic tree was constructed using mega <dig> . twenty four drought-induced wheat wrkys belonged to group ii,  <dig> to group iii, and nine to group i .fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of drought-responsive wrky genes in wheat and  <dig> atwrky proteins. the phylogenetic tree was based on comparisons of amino acid sequences and produced by mega  <dig>  software



sequence analysis of tawrky <dig> and tawrky33
among the  <dig> drought-induced wheat wrky genes, tawrky <dig> to tawrky <dig> showed the largest transcript differences, being up-regulated more than three-log fold ) and tawrky21/24/33/ <dig> showed the largest background transcript levels among all wrky genes regulated by drought . the drought stress expression patterns of these  <dig> wheat wrky genes were further investigated. as shown in fig.  <dig>  tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> gave high responses to drought stress, peaking at more than 30-fold at one and two h, respectively. these genes were selected for further investigation.fig.  <dig> expression patterns of  <dig> wheat wrky genes under drought stress. these  <dig> wheat wrky genes include tawrky1 , tawrky2 , tawrky3 , tawrky4 , tawrky5 , tawrky <dig> , tawrky7 , tawrky8 , tawrky21 , tawrky24 , tawrky33  and tawrky42 . the ordinates are fold changes, and the horizontal ordinate is treatment time. the actin gene was used as an internal reference. the data are representative of three independent experiments



tawrky <dig> contained a 912 bp open reading frame  encoding a  <dig> amino acid protein of  <dig>  kda with pi  <dig> . the orf of tawrky <dig> was 1071 bp encoding a  <dig>  kda protein with pi  <dig> . the predicted amino acid sequences of tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> possessed one wrky domain with the highly conserved wrkygqk motif, but two different deduced zinc finger motifs , respectively. tawrky <dig> contained an n-terminal cut domain  and a c-terminal nl domain  according to smart . tawrky <dig> contained an n-terminal basic region leucin zipper  domain  and a c-terminal e-z type heat repeat  domain  . a four-stranded β-sheet with a zinc-binding pocket formed by conserved cys/his residues was present in wrky domains in the tertiary structures of tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> . we searched for wrky homologies in ncbi using tawrky <dig> as a query. amino acid sequence alignment showed that tawrky <dig> shared the highest identity  with aetwrky <dig>  from the wild diploid aegilops tauschii , a progenitor of hexaploid wheat   <cit> , suggesting that tawrky <dig> was located in a d-genome chromosome. no candidate with complete identity to tawrky <dig> was found in the genomic databases of a. tauschii and triticum urartu , the a-genome progenitor. therefore, tawrky <dig> might be located in a b chromosome.fig.  <dig> domain organization  and tertiary structures  of tawrky <dig> and tawrky33



tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> were localized in the nucleus
to further investigate their biological activities tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> were fused to the n-terminus of the green fluorescent protein  reporter gene under control of the camv 35s promoter and transferred into wheat mesophyll protoplasts. the 35s::gfp vector was transformed as the control. fluorescence of tawrky1-gfp and tawrky33-gfp were specifically detected in the nucleus, whereas fluorescence of the control gfp was distributed throughout the cells . therefore, tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> likely function in the nucleus.fig.  <dig> subcellular localization of the tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> proteins. 35s::tawrky1-gfp, 35s::tawrky33-gfp and 35s::gfp control vectors were transiently expressed in wheat protoplasts. scale bars = 10 μm



stress-related regulatory elements in the tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> promoters
to gain further insight into the mechanism of transcriptional regulation we isolated  <dig>  kb promoter regions upstream of the tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> atg start codons. we searched for putative cis-acting elements in the promoter regions using the databases plant cis-acting elements, and place  . a number of regulatory elements responding to drought, salt, low-temperature and aba were recognized in both promoters, including aba-responsive elements , dehydration-responsive elements , w-box elements, and myb and myc binding sequences. in addition, gibberellin responsive elements  and several elicitor responsive elements  were identified .table  <dig> putative cis-acting elements in the tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> promoters

response mechanisms of tawrky <dig> and tawrkt <dig> under abiotic stress
in order to clarify potential functions, the responses of tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> under various abiotic stress conditions were analyzed by qrt-pcr . the tawrky <dig> gene was slightly induced by high-temperature and exogenous aba at a maximum level of about three-fold. transcription of tawrky <dig> was not affected by jasmonic acid methylester , but was down-regulated by low-temperature.fig.  <dig> expression patterns of tawrky <dig>  and tawrky <dig>  under abiotic stresses. the vertical ordinate is fold change; the horizontal ordinate is treatment time. the actin gene was used as an internal reference. the data are representative of three independent experiments



by comparison, tawrky <dig> rapidly responded to high-temperature, aba and meja, with peak levels  occurring after one h of treatment. low-temperature also activated transcription of tawrky <dig>  with peak transcription levels earlier than those for drought, high-temperature, aba and meja.

improved drought and aba tolerance and decreased rates of water loss in transgenic arabidopsis
wrky transcription factors might be involved in plant stress signaling . tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> under the control of camv35s were transformed into arabidopsis plants to further investigate their functions. semi-quantitative rt-pcr was used to confirm transgenic arabidopsis plants carrying tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> genes . progenies from transgenic lines were used for analysis of seed germination under osmotic stress. there was no difference in seed germination between transgenic lines and wt plants grown on murashige and skoog  media . in comparison more than  <dig>  % of tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> transgenic seeds germinated in 4 % polyethylene glycol  <dig> -supplemented ms media after four days compared to  <dig>  % for wt seeds . in 6 % peg6000-supplemented ms media  tawrky <dig> transgenic seeds showed clear differences in germination rates compared to wt; nevertheless, tawrky <dig> transgenic lines had higher germination rates than tawrky <dig> transgenic lines and wt .fig.  <dig> germination of transgenic arabidopsis lines under mock drought stress. seed germinations of wt and tawrky <dig> transgenic arabidopsis lines on ms medium with or without  <dig> and  <dig> % peg <dig> . seed germinations of wt and tawrky <dig> transgenic arabidopsis lines on ms medium with or without  <dig> and  <dig> % peg <dig> . seeds were incubated at 4 °c for three days followed by 22 °c for germination. seeds from three independent transgenic lines with tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> were grown on ms medium with or without  <dig> and 6 % peg <dig>  wt seeds were grown in the same conditions as a control. data are means ± sd of three independent experiments and * above the error bars or different letters above the columns indicate significant differences at p < <dig> 



aba tolerance of tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> transgenic lines was identified by seed germination rates of arabidopsis on ms media containing aba. average germination rates of tawrky <dig> transgenic lines were about 82 % compared to 75 % for wt in  <dig>  μm aba-supplemented ms media, meanwhile the germination rates of tawrky <dig> transgenic lines were higher than those of the tawrky <dig> transgenic lines and wt . treated with 1 μm aba, tawrky <dig> transgenic lines exhibited obviously higher seed germination rates than those of wt, and tawrky <dig> transgenic lines shared almost the same germination rates with wt .

transgenic lines and wt arabidopsis seeds were grown on ms medium for 5 days at 22 °c, and then transferred to ms medium containing  <dig> and 6 % peg <dig>  respectively . the tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> transgenic lines had similar phenotypes to wt seedlings under normal conditions. total root lengths of the transgenic lines were longer than those of wt plants under both peg <dig> treatments after seven days, although peg <dig> stress reduced the growth of both transgenic and wt plants. tawrky <dig> significantly promoted root growth in transgenic lines compared with tawrky <dig> transgenic lines under peg <dig> treatment.fig.  <dig> total root lengths of transgenic arabidopsis lines under mock drought stress. phenotypes of wt and tawrky33 transgenic arabidopsis seedlings under ms medium with or without  <dig> % peg <dig> . root lengths of wt and tawrky <dig> transgenic arabidopsis seedlings grown on ms medium with or without  <dig> and  <dig> % peg <dig> .  root lengths of wt and tawrky33 transgenic arabidopsis seedlings grown on ms medium with or without  <dig> and  <dig> % peg <dig> . five-day-old arabidopsis seedlings were planted on ms medium with or without  <dig> and 6 % peg <dig> for seven days. data are means ± sd of three independent experiments and * above the error bars or different letters above the columns indicate significant differences at p < <dig>

enhanced thermotolerance of tawrky <dig> transgenic lines
following earlier results on response to high-temperature  the functions of transgenic lines under high-temperature stress were investigated . tawrky <dig> transgenic lines exhibited high survival rates after exposure to 45 °c for five h, whereas tawrky <dig> transgenic lines showed no clear differences from wt . the survival rates of the tawrky <dig> transgenic lines were more than 50 % after heat treatment compared to less than 30 % for tawrky <dig> transgenics and wt. this suggested that tawrky <dig> had a positive role in thermotolerance.fig.  <dig> analysis of transgenic arabidopsis lines under heat stress. phenotypes of wt and tawrky <dig> transgenic arabidopsis lines under heat stress . sruvival rates of wt and tawrky <dig> transgenic arabidopsis lines under heat stress .  sruvival rates of wt and tawrky <dig> transgenic arabidopsis lines under heat stress . seeds from three independent transgenic lines of tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> were grown on ms medium. five-day-old seedlings were heat-treated at 45 °c for five h before returning them to 22 °c to continue to grow vertically for 2 days. data are means ± sd of three independent experiments and * above the error bars or different letters above the columns indicate significant differences at p < <dig> 



changed transcripts of stress-responsive genes
tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> conferred stress tolerance in arabidopsis. to investigate the tolerance mechanism we analyzed several stress-related genes possibly activated by tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig>  compared to wt, transcripts of aba <dig>  aba <dig>  abi <dig>  abi <dig> and rd29a were increased in tawrky <dig> transgenics whereas dreb2b expression was not significantly changed under normal conditions . similarly, overexpression of tawrky <dig> regulated transcripts of aba <dig>  aba <dig>  abi <dig>  abi <dig>  dreb2b and rd29a, especially aba <dig> and abi <dig> to extremely high levels . as shown in fig.  <dig>  the luc/ren ratio was increased significantly when the aba <dig> and abi <dig> pro-luc reporter constructs were co-transfected with tawrky <dig>  compared with the control that was co-transfected with the empty construct. these results indicated that overexpression of the tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> genes activated stress-responsive downstream genes.fig.  <dig> expression levels of stress-responsive genes under regulation of tawrky <dig>  and tawrky <dig> . the vertical ordinates are fold changes, and the horizontal coordinates are gene names. data are means ± sd of three independent experiments and * above the error bars or different letters above the columns indicate significant differences at p < <dig>

discussion
the functions of wrkys have been extensively explored in various plant species over the past ten years, especially in arabidopsis and rice. little information existed about the role of wheat wrkys in mediating abiotic responses. recently, sezer et al. characterized  <dig> tawrkys according to sequence similarity, motif type and phylogenetic relationships, improving knowledge of wrkys in wheat  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> putative drought-responsive wrky genes were identified from de novo transcriptome sequencing data of drought-treated wheat. the phylogenic tree revealed that most drought-responsive wrkys belonged to groups ii and iii . recent investigations showed that most wrkys in these groups function in drought tolerance in many plant species. for example, wrky63/abo <dig>  belonging to group iii, mediated responses to aba and drought tolerance in arabidopsis  <cit> . similarly, atwrky <dig> and gmwrky <dig>  which were identified as group ii, were induced by drought and their expression conferred drought tolerance in arabidopsis  <cit> . in the present study tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig>  members of groups ii and iii, conferred drought tolerance in arabidopsis . therefore, it was supposed that wrkys in these groups might be involved in drought stress response.

wrkys are important in many aspects of plant defense, including mamp-  or pamp-triggered  immunity, effector-triggered immunity  and systemin acquired resistance . increasing evidence shows that wrkys are activated not only by disease-related stimuli and pathogen infection, but also by multiple abiotic stresses  <cit> . for example,  <dig> of  <dig> rice and  <dig> of  <dig> wheat wrky genes responded to peg <dig>  salt, cold or heat stresses  <cit> . tawrky <dig> may act as a positive regulator in drought, salt and osmotic stress responses  <cit> . overexpression of ghwrky <dig> conferred tolerance to salt stress in tobacco  <cit> . in the present study, except for drought response, tawrky <dig> was involved in strong responses to high- and low-temperature and aba, possibly related to cis-elements in the promoter . for instance, the tawrky <dig> promoter contained multiple abre and ltre elements that might be responsible for low-temperature and exogenous aba. the elre might induce large responses of tawrky <dig> to abiotic stresses. in addition, tawrky <dig> was highly induced by meja although there is no meja-related element. this could be the reason why meja-related elements had not been identified previously.

aba is regarded to play a crucial role in plant abiotic stress response and development and is considered to be a negative regulator of biotrophic pathogen resistance  <cit> . it has been reported that aba-dependent and aba-independent pathways exist in stress response  <cit> . dreb2s play important roles in aba-independent pathway and often as marker genes in stress responses  <cit> . a number of transcription factors and their target genes are involved in mediating aba signal transduction and have been shown to regulate many molecular and cellular responses  <cit> . previous studies show that abi1/ <dig> and atwrky <dig> are key regulatory components of aba receptors rcars and abar, respectively. abi <dig>  a positive regulator of aba signaling, exists in the downstream of abi1/ <dig> and atwrky <dig>  they are key players in aba signal transduction and act by negatively regulating aba response. aba synthesis genes aba <dig> and aba <dig> were both detected in these studies, implying an acceleration of aba production. consistent with that, transcript abundance of abi <dig> also increased , demonstrating that tawrky <dig> likely increased the level of drought tolerance by increasing traffic through the aba synthesis and transduction pathways.

it was reported that rd29a was induced by dehydration, low-temperature, high salinity or exogenous aba. the promoter region of rd29a contains the cis-acting dre that is involved in expression of rd29a rapidly responding to dehydration and high salinity stresses in arabidopsis. here, rd29a was up-regulated in tawrky <dig> transgenic lines , suggesting that tawrky <dig> acts as a positive regulator in hyperosmotic stress response in arabidopsis. these studies collectively demonstrated that tawrky <dig> might play a key role in aba- and drought-responsive signaling networks. overexpression of wheat tawrky <dig> enhanced stz expression, whereas tawrky <dig> promoted dreb2a-mediated activation of rd29a, rd29b and cor <dig> , resulting in tolerance to salt and drought in transgenic plants  <cit> . therefore, wheat wrkys affected stress tolerance through regulation of different downstream genes. taken together, a model was proposed in which tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> transcription was activated under abiotic stress . the meja-mediated signaling pathway is relevant to resistance to necrotrophic pathogens, wounding and insect herbivores . the aba and the ja could jointly modulate stress-related gene expression despite antagonistic interactions between the aba and the ja/et signaling pathways, they also  <cit> . in the present study, tawrky <dig> was moderately and highly responsive to aba and meja, respectively . these results indicated that tawrky <dig> could coordinately integrate the aba and the meja pathways, but not antagonize them. therefore, we speculate that tawrky <dig> might have roles in interaction of the aba and meja signaling pathways and might be related to both abiotic stress tolerance and disease responses in plants.

CONCLUSIONS
forty-eight putative drought-responsive wrky genes were identified from de novo transcriptome sequencing data of drought-treated wheat. they were classified into three groups, according to sequence similarity and motif identity. tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig>  belonging to groups ii and iii, were selected for further investigation. both tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> responded to multiple stresses. overexpression of tawrky <dig> and tawrky <dig> activated several stress-related downstream genes, increased germination rates and promoted root growth in arabidopsis under stresses. these studies provide candidate genes for future functional analysis of tawrkys involved in the drought- and heat-related signal pathways in wheat.
