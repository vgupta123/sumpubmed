BACKGROUND
artemisia  is a widely distributed plant genus that is predominantly found in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. some species within this genus are valued in medicine, cooking, and forage for livestock  <cit> . big sagebrush  is recognized for its importance to ecosystem function. big sagebrush is one of the most abundant, widespread, and ecologically important woody shrub species in the intermountain regions of western north america. this species contains three widespread subspecies  that occupy distinct habitats and two less common subspecies   <cit> . prior to the anglo-american settlement, big sagebrush was estimated to occupy up to  <dig> million ha of the western united states, while contemporary estimates have shown that the area has been reduced to approximately  <dig> million ha  <cit> . changes in land use and disturbance regimes  are major factors in the degradation of these ecosystems. such disturbances can lead to invasions by cheat grass  and other weeds that fundamentally change the wildfire frequency and severely reduce the frequency of sagebrush in ecosystems where it historically dominated  <cit> . restoration of these ecosystems not only requires replanting of big sagebrush, but the replanting should be carried out with a basis of scientific knowledge. early efforts toward this goal have been made by mahalovich and mcarthur  <cit> , where the authors outline the importance of seed plantation by geographical distribution of the subspecies. restoration of sustainable populations necessitates understanding of the local and landscape level genetic structure of natural big sagebrush populations.

polyploidy and intra- and interspecific hybridization are likely the important factors in big sagebrush adaptation and landscape dominance. big sagebrush subspecies occupy specific ecological niches: ssp. tridentata grows in alluvial flats at elevation typically lower than  <dig> m, ssp. vaseyana is found in higher altitude uplands at elevations above  <dig> m up to timberline, and ssp. wyomingensis occupies drier sites with shallow soils  <cit> . subspecies wyomingensis is universally tetraploid, whereas sspp. tridentata and vaseyana are typically diploid; although both sspp. tridentata and vaseyana also include tetraploid populations  <cit> . hybridization between ssp. tridentata and ssp. vaseyana is common under the appropriate ecological conditions. hybridization among big sagebrush subspecies has been studied using reciprocal transplants, showing that natural selection tends to limit the hybrids of sspp. tridentata and vaseyana to a zone between the parental subspecies habitat  <cit> . mcarthur and sanderson  <cit>  suggest that hybrid zones could be repositories of genetic variation and gene exchange, and can influence the evolution of big sagebrush.

though widely acknowledged as an important shrub of the intermountain ecosystem in western north america, limited dna sequence data has been collected on big sagebrush. a search for a. tridentata nucleotide sequences in the ncbi database yielded less than  <dig> nucleotide sequences. as a genus, artemisia has approximately  <dig>  million sequences  of which  <dig>  million reads are archived in the sequence read archive , from a. annua est projects  <cit> , and an ongoing a. annua genome project  <cit> . a. annua is a medicinal herb native to temperate asia and is not found in the western hemisphere. sequences of a. tridentata are needed to conduct research studies involving phylogenetics, population genetics, and ecological genetics in north american big sagebrush populations. transcriptome sequencing and annotation, and marker detection within big sagebrush est sequences will provide a rapid means to satisfy these information needs and set the stage for future studies.

in this study, we characterized the leaf transcriptome of two big sagebrush subspecies, a.t. ssp. tridentata and a.t. ssp. vaseyana and compared the resulting ests. we also sequenced a. t. ssp. wyomingensis ests to assess snp distribution in this subspecies compared to sspp. tridentata and vaseyana. our objectives were to 1) identify and characterize a large number of expressed genes in a. tridentata, 2) detect sequence differences within and between sspp. tridentata and vaseyana that could be used as markers to further our understanding of adaptive, phenotypic variation within the species, and 3) gain inference into the origins of the tetraploid a. t. ssp. wyomingensis.

RESULTS
est sequencing, assembly, and characterization
we created two normalized cdna libraries from leaf tissues of two subspecies of a. tridentata: sspp. tridentata and vaseyana. independent sequencing of these cdna libraries generated  <dig>  sequence reads containing  <dig> , <dig> bases of sequence from ssp. tridentata and  <dig>  sequence reads containing  <dig> , <dig> bases of sequence from ssp. vaseyana . assuming a limited amount of sequence divergence between the two subspecies' coding sequence, both sets of ests were combined into a single, de novo assembly . this assembly contained in  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singleton sequences. from the assembled contigs, estscan  <cit>  predicted  <dig>   protein coding open reading frames, of which  <dig>   were greater than  <dig> bp. some contigs were assembled from reads of a single subspecies.  <dig>  contigs were exclusively composed of ssp. tridentata reads and  <dig>  contigs were exclusively composed of only ssp. vaseyana reads . est read number ranged from  <dig> reads to  <dig>  reads in a contig, with a median of  <dig> est reads per contigs. unless stated otherwise, the combined assembly sequences were used for subsequent bioinformatic analyses. from the remaining, unassembled reads , estscan predicted  <dig>   protein coding open reading frames, of which  <dig>   were greater than  <dig> bp.

protein homologies between big sagebrush ests and the nr protein database were identified using blastx. out of  <dig>  assembled contig sequences,  <dig>  sequences  had significant alignments  and out of  <dig>  singleton sequences,  <dig>  sequences  had significant alignments . of the contigs with blastx hits,  <dig>   sequences had their best blast alignment to vitis vinifera and  <dig>  and  <dig>  to helianthus annus and lactuca sativa respectively, both of which are in the asteraceae. only fifty-four  contigs had their best matches to artemisia annua, owing to the limited number of artemisia proteins  in the nr protein database. the nr blast results were utilized by blast2go  <cit>  to annotate the est sequences with go terms. one or more go ids were assigned to  <dig>   contigs with a maximum of  <dig> go ids assigned to a single sequence. the distributions of contigs in three, non-mutually exclusive go categories: biological process , cellular component , and molecular function  were well represented by a diverse set of putative biological functions . in bp category, the most abundant go term was metabolic process , followed by cellular process , and unknown biological process . in cc category, unknown cellular component was the most abundant , followed by cell component  and intracellular component . similarly in the mf category, binding was the most abundant category , followed by catalytic activity , and transferase activity . the three groups  are not mutually exclusive; therefore, some contigs were assigned gene ontologies in more than one type of category.

comparison of the  <dig>  contig sequences against the pfam-a domain database with an e-value cutoff at 1e- <dig> resulted in  <dig>  contigs  matching at least one protein domain model. the distribution of the domains ranged from a maximum of  <dig> domains assigned to the same contig to a minimum of one domain per contig . the three most common domains were the protein kinase domain , followed by the protein tyrosine kinase domain , and the rna recognition motif domain .

genes associated with secondary metabolites synthesis in a. tridentata
big sagebrush leaves are known to synthesize and store large quantities of terpenoids on the epidermal surfaces of glandular leaf trichomes  <cit> . therefore, a search was conducted among the annotated contigs to identify putative genes that code for enzymes involved in terpenoid synthesis via the mevalonic acid  and 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate  biosynthetic pathways  <cit> . most of the enzymes involved in these pathways were detected in our annotated contig sequences, and are presented in the additional materials . coumarin derivatives are considered as a tool for subspecies identification because big sagebrush subspecies differ in their amount of fluorescence  <cit> . we also searched the annotated contigs for enzymes involved in coumarin biosynthesis. coumarins in plants are derived via the phenylpropanoid pathway from p-coumaroyl coa  <cit> . at the top of the phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine lyase acts on the substrate l-phenylalanine, and converts it to cinnamate  which is then oxidized to p-coumarate by the enzyme cinnamate 4-hydroxylase. the enzyme 4-hydroxycinnamoyl coa ligase then ligates an s-coa group to p-coumarate, forming p-coumaroyl coa. we were able to detect putative gene sequences for these three main enzymes involved in coumarin synthesis in our annotated contig dataset. individual tests of enzymatic substrates and products are needed to confirm their roles in coumarin synthesis within big sagebrush.

discovery and frequency of snps in ests
a large number of resident snps were discovered within the accessions examined in this study. a search for snps yielded  <dig>  ssp. tridentata  snps with an average base coverage of  <dig> × and  <dig>  ssp. vaseyana snps  with an average base coverage of 15×. these putative snps may represent a high level of heterozygosity that exists in big sagebrush through its large effective population size and its wind-pollinated reproductive strategy. future segregation analysis would be needed to ascertain if these putative snps are truly two alleles at a single locus or an artifact of the sequencing and/or assembly process. the individual assemblies contained many fewer snps than detected in the combined assembly  prior to filtering those snps that were not discriminatory between sspp. tridentata and vaseyana .

when only snps that were near homogenous  within the two accessions were considered, a total of  <dig>  snps were detected between the sspp. tridentata and vaseyana when a threshold of  <dig> × coverage was applied . the snp density in the est sequences between subspecies was  <dig> snp/ <dig> bp. the analysis showed that  <dig>   of the total consensus sequences contained at least one snp and snps per contig ranged from  <dig>  contigs with a single snp to a single contig with  <dig> snps . we chose to exclude snps that were less that 90% homogeneous within either accession 1) to provide a reduced set snps that could discriminate between the two subspecies and 2) to allow for some degree of sequencing error at the snp position when there was low sequence coverage. to estimate the effect of snp heterogeneity within a dna source, snps were also identified with a threshold of homogeneity for snps of 99%. this resulted in the detection of  <dig>  snps indicating that 13% of the snps originally detected either ssp. tridentata or ssp. vaseyana had more than one base at that position albeit at a low frequency. these multiple bases could be the result of heterozygosity, differential expression of alleles, assembly error, or sequencing error. some of the contigs with high number of snps  are likely artifacts of applying a single set of assembly parameters to a set of heterogeneous genes and splice forms - each with their own evolutionary history. collectively, contigs with an abundance of snps  are best avoided in future population genetic studies, though individually each contig with a multitude of snps might provide an interesting case study of gene or gene family evolution. contigs with a high number of snps have been highlighted in additional file  <dig> along with metadata for each contig. of  <dig>  snps,  <dig>  snps were distributed in the putative coding sequence and  <dig>  snps were in the 5'or 3' untranslated regions. forty-two percent of the identified snps fit within the  <dig> to 30% range for minor allele frequency, 30% within the  <dig> to 40% range and the remaining 28% within the  <dig> to 50% range. as expected, the transition mutations  were the most abundant, outnumbering the transversion mutations  by  <dig>  × margin . all snp information of the combined assembly and the sequences with snps have been deposited in dbsnp in genbank. the snps are submitted under the handle udall_lab . full contig sequences are available upon request.

discovery and frequency of ssrs in ests
the individual and combined assemblies of ests were used for the ssr analysis. the individual assembly analysis resulted in a total of  <dig> contigs containing  <dig>  ssrs and  <dig> contigs containing  <dig> ssrs in ssp. tridentata and ssp. vaseyana, respectively. homopolymer ssrs that are reported by default in misa were not reported because of known limitations of  <dig> sequencing chemistry. the occurrence and frequency of different ssr motif repeats in est sequences of the two subspecies were explored . although both subspecies have a similar number of reads, the frequency of each type of ssr motif was almost doubled in ssp. tridentata compared to ssp. vaseyana . as might be expected from data containing open reading frames, the most common type of repeat was a trinucleotide motif , followed by a dinucleotide motif  and a hexanucleotide motif . repeat motifs unique to each subspecies were also detected. excluding the counts of ssrs in compound formation, subspecies tridentata had  <dig> unique ssrs and ssp. vaseyana had  <dig> unique ssrs, relative to each other. the most dominant repeat motif overall is ac/gt with a frequency of  <dig> %  in ssp. tridentata, whereas the most dominant repeat motif in both subspecies is acc/ggt with a frequency of  <dig> %  and  <dig> % . we were unable to detect any cg/gc motif in either subspecies' est sequences. this could be due to limitations of empcr used by the  <dig> sequencing protocol. additional details about di- and trinucleotide repeat motifs in both subspecies are listed in additional file  <dig> 

in addition to misa-detected ssrs, a custom perl script was used to identify putative polymorphic ssrs between ssp. tridentata and ssp. vaseyana in the combined assembly. within an assembled contig, the polymorphic ssrs were identified by counting differences in the numbers of repeat motifs during informatic comparison of ssp. tridentata sequences to ssp. vaseyana sequences. this resulted in detection of  <dig> polymorphic ssrs in  <dig> contigs between the two subspecies. comparing these  <dig> ssr motif structures to the ssr motif structures identified in individual assemblies, we observed that  <dig>  ssrs in the combined assembly were found to be identical to those in the individual assemblies and  <dig>  had a different number of repeats than detected in the individual assemblies.

snp and ssr validation
snps and ssrs found in the est assembly were independently validated. snps between a. tridentata subspecies were directly validated using two different experimental approaches: subsequent sanger re-sequencing of cdna amplicons  and by re-sequencing targeted loci by sequence capture. snps were not considered validated unless both expected bases were identified in subsequent sequencing efforts and a distinction was made between two different types of validation. validation type  <dig> was where the two different bases identified in the est assembly were detected at the snp position . validation type  <dig> was where the two different bases identified in the est assembly were detected at the snp position and they were consistently different between the two subspecies of a. tridentata, as originally detected.

subsequent sanger re-sequencing of cdna amplicons was performed on the same individuals as used for est sequencing. analysis of fragment sizes on agarose gel confirmed amplification of all  targeted with primers in both subspecies cdna. of these loci,  <dig> were chosen for sanger re-sequencing. three snps were transitions  and three were transversions . the snp base were validated in cdna from both subspecies for six of six snps  and three of six , confirming their respective identification within the combined assembly. in the est assembly, coverage of the chosen snps ranged from  <dig> to 27x and from 20% to 46% in their minor allele frequency. there was no obvious relationship between the amount of est coverage and snp validation in this small subset.

re-sequencing targeted loci by sequence capture was also used to validate snps in two distinct individuals of ssp. tridentata and two distinct individuals of ssp. vaseyana .  <dig> ests containing  <dig> discriminating snps between the two subspecies were targeted for re-sequencing by sequence capture. these targets were selected based on putative est function  rather than snp density, thus some contigs had several more snps than others. reads obtained from sequence capture were mapped to their respective reference targets  resulting and  <dig> snps in  <dig> contigs had capture reads overlapping their respective positions. both snp bases were detected at  <dig>  of the snp positions  and  <dig>  of the snp bases were polymorphic  between the two independent individuals of ssp. tridentata and two independent individuals of ssp. vaseyana used for sequence capture. of the 46% of the snp positions that did not validate , only a single type of base was detected in these four individuals  and the base call always matched one of the expected bases at the snp. for these monomorphic snps, additional sequence coverage of snp likely would not identify the 'other' base and change our interpretation because these snps had an average of  <dig>  sequence coverage. 8% of the snp positions had an additional or third base at the snp position of a single read in these four individuals.

the low validation rates of snps  derived from ests could be due to several factors including different genotypes of individual plants, allelic expression biases of sagebrush genes combined with a moderate amount  <dig> est sequencing, and errors due to mapping reads to a non-sequenced genome. different genotypes of individual plants could explain the low snp validation rate between subspecies. for example, 38% and 10% of snps initially detected in our est assembly were polymorphic between the two individuals of ssp. tridentata and polymorphic between the two individuals of ssp. vaseyana, respectively. individual genotypic differences could also explain the 67% level of two-base detection at snp positions . of the  <dig> snp loci, 16-36% had both bases in individual plants . thus, it is not too surprising that the four individuals sampled for validation were also coincidently homozygous for many snps found in ests of a ssp. tridentata and in ests of a ssp. vaseyana individual, particularly if either of the two originally est-sampled individuals contained a low frequency allele.

ssrs were validated by re-sequencing of sanger amplicons,  <dig> loci were selected from the combined est assembly. ten of the  <dig> primer pairs amplified loci in leaf cdna from both subspecies. of these  <dig> loci,  <dig> loci were selected for sanger re-sequencing. re-sequencing of the selected pcr-amplified cdna sequences confirmed the misa-detected ssrs . variation in repeat length of the re-sequenced loci was verified between subspecies in  <dig> of the  <dig> loci. of these three ssrs,  <dig> and  <dig> were bioinformatically detected a priori as polymorphic, based on the perl script parameters, whereas  <dig> was not, suggesting that the number of bioinformatically identified polymorphic ssrs was an underestimate of the number of truly polymorphic ssrs. we expect that more ssr loci likely exist but they were under the conservative thresholds used in our bioinformatic analysis. the sequence capture experiment also validated a number of ssrs in contig consensus sequences of the combined assembly. capture targets included  <dig> putative ssrs, of which  <dig> had overlapping reads from sequence capture. in every instance, the presence of an ssr was confirmed. of these  <dig> ssrs, five ssrs were polymorphic in repeat number, four ssrs contained snp polymorphisms in one or more repeats, and five ssrs did not have any polymorphisms detected in the sequence capture reads.

marker evaluation in genomic dna
because of our interest in marker utilization for population genetic studies in genomic dna ,  <dig> ssr and  <dig> snp primer pairs were evaluated in big sagebrush genomic dna. genomic ssr loci were also amplified from the same individuals using the same primers used for ssr validation in cdna. fourteen  ssr loci out of  <dig> ssr loci amplified in both sspp. tridentata and vaseyana and  <dig>  ssr loci out of  <dig> ssr loci amplified in ssp. wyomingensis. these  <dig> primers pairs produced fragments of expected sizes in all three subspecies. re-sequencing of genomic dna amplicons for ssr validation was not performed, but we expect that the amplified genomic dna fragments also contain the targeted ssrs.

of the  <dig> snp primer pairs,  <dig>  amplified targeted loci in all three subspecies including the five loci used for cdna snp validation. the genomic fragments of these five loci were sequenced in two ssp. tridentata individuals, three ssp. vaseyana individuals and two ssp. wyomingensis individuals. for two loci, we observed that both sspp. tridentata and vaseyana were homozygous at each snp allele  while ssp. wyomingensis was dimorphic . in two different loci, ssp. wyomingensis sequences contained a single variant matching either ssp. tridentata or ssp. vaseyana variant. the remaining snp remained unconfirmed due to poor sanger sequencing results. additional sanger validation of individual snp loci would have been an overly laborious process since other sequencing methods exist for validating larger numbers of snps . instead of individually genotyping snp additional loci, genotypic assessment of ssp. wyomingensis at putative snps loci was determined en masse using illumina sequencing .

detection of allelic snp variants in ssp. wyomingensis
approximately  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million illumina reads were obtained from the montana and utah ssp. wyomingensis samples, respectively. after trimming the 5' ends of the sequences to remove barcodes, the sequences were aligned to the combined est assembly  as a sequence reference. in the montana sample, the illumina reads overlapped  <dig> snp positions at a depth of ≥  <dig> × with 10% of the reads containing at least one variant. at these snp positions, both allelic variants  were verified at  <dig> snps. the ssp. tridentata base matched at  <dig> additional snp positions and the ssp. vaseyana base matched at  <dig> other snp positions. in the utah sample, illumina reads overlapped  <dig>  snp positions at a depth of ≥  <dig> × with 10% of the reads containing at least one variant. at these snp positions, both allelic variants  were verified at  <dig> snps. the ssp. tridentata base matched  <dig> additional snp positions and the ssp. vaseyana based matched at  <dig> other snps positions. verified snps from the montana sample were distributed among  <dig> contigs of the combined assembly, and verified snps from the utah sample were distributed among  <dig> contigs. this variability of snp detection is not surprising as the leaf tissue samples for illumina cdna sequencing were collected in different environments under different conditions and the cdna fragments were not normalized  or modified in any way to alter the association between gene expression levels and number of reads per gene.

directional selection in subspecies genes
to detect functional sequence diversity and diversifying selection, putative exon sequences were compared between sspp. tridentata and vaseyana. comparison of synonymous base substitutions  and non-synonymous base substitutions  between the two subspecies would suggest whether these sequences were influenced by stabilizing or diversifying selection. the distribution of the calculated ka/ks ratios for the contigs was found to be ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> ; however any ka/ks value greater than  <dig>  was discarded during the analysis assuming that such high values likely resulted from alignment errors. the resultant distribution had a median of  <dig>  . a bootstrap analysis with  <dig>  data points at 95% confidence level  was also performed on the ka/ks distribution, which resulted in  <dig>  as the lower limit and  <dig>  as the upper limit of the confidence interval bracket. a histogram of the ka/ks distribution is shown . following a method similar to novaes et al.  <cit> , we further classified genes with ka/ks <  <dig>  to be under stabilizing selection, and ka/ks between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for diversifying selection, and compared the ka/ks distribution with the gene annotation results. this approach gave us  <dig> annotated contigs in stabilizing category and  <dig> annotated contigs in diversifying category. in both categories, the distribution of go ids by contigs was the highest for the go class 'molecular function' with  <dig> unique go ids distributed among  <dig>  contigs in stabilizing category and  <dig> go ids distributed among  <dig>  contigs in diversifying category.

discussion
previous reports of ests from non-model, yet ecologically and economically important organisms have been successfully sequenced and annotated using next generation sequencing  <cit> . here, we have used  <dig> next-generation sequencing to generate the first transcriptome sequence data for big sagebrush, a key ecological species of the western north america. similar to reports of other efforts, the assembled ests of big sagebrush were further analyzed to generate a functional characterization of the transcriptome and discover putative molecular markers . a surprisingly high level of nucleotide diversity was also found within individual assemblies of ests from big sagebrush accessions.

to generate a functional characterization of the big sagebrush transcriptome, we compared the contigs and singletons obtained from the combined assembly to peptides within the non-redundant protein database using blastx. the low number of matches  to artemisia annua sequences is probably due to fewer number of a. annua sequences available in the nr database compared to species such as vitis vinifera. we expect that the numbers of hits will substantially increase with the eventual publication and annotation of an a. annua and other artemisia and asteraceae genome sequences. a majority  of the assembled sequences did not align with any peptide in the nr database, possibly indicating the presence of substantial number of novel genes in a. tridentata transcriptome and related taxa. genes of unknown function are not unexpected, as the discovery of novel genes has been demonstrated in other est sequencing projects within non-agricultural plant families  <cit> .

many of the contigs and singleton ests identified in this study are expected to have ecological and adaptive relevance. previous studies relating sagebrush biochemistry to mule deer feeding preference suggest strong correlation between the composition and concentration of secondary metabolites, especially terpenoids, and mule deer preference of sagebrush  <cit> . we were able to identify many, but not all, of the genes coding enzymes involved in mva, mep, and phenylpropenoid pathways. the failure to detect all genes from these pathways could be explained by a lack of transcriptome coverage and/or by a lack of pathway documentation of these specific genes  <cit> . the detection of major enzymes involved in phenylpropanoid pathway in big sagebrush and variation within these pathways may aid in elucidating herbivore preferences and trade-offs between defense responses.

polymorphisms in a. tridentata ests
a large number of snp and ssr markers were discovered and different subsets of snps were validated using sanger amplicon sequencing of cdna and genomic dna, illumina cdna sequencing of ssp. wyomingensis, and sequence capture. we verified  six of six tested snps using amplicon sanger sequencing of individually selected pcr fragments. additional verification  was deemed unnecessary due to past experience in arabidopsis  <cit> , amaranth  <cit> , and cotton  using this same conservative bioinformatic pipeline. these other studies verified 100% of  <dig> × more snps using sanger re-sequencing of amplicons and demonstrated that they segregated in mapping populations such that genetic maps were reliably constructed. similar to these other studies, a small number of genotypes  were used for snp discovery in sagebrush ests. it was possible that the two individuals selected for est sequencing could also represent minor alleles at a number of snps. thus, the ssrs and snps that we report here represent dna differences between individuals and differences between subspecies.

in our efforts to describe snps in big sagebrush, we have also quantified the number of snps that were due to subspecies differences and those that were due to individual differences. the high numbers of snps between individuals, apparent in the individual assemblies , in the validation using ssp. wyomingensis, and in the sequence capture assemblies  suggested significant amounts of nucleotide diversity between individual genomes of artemisia. this evidence was supported by three findings. 1) when discriminating snps between ssp. tridentata and ssp. vaseyana were re-identified at a higher stringency than 90% , 13% of the snps were not detected because of a single parameter requiring a degree of homogeneity among residues originating from a single dna source. this suggests that both individuals used for est sequencing contained a high number of heterozygous loci. 2) using illumina sequencing, only 36% and 44% of the snp positions had both alleles detected in the ssp. wyomingesis samples respectively, where nearly all of the snp positions were at least represented by one or the other allele. this indicated that both alleles of a significant number of the snps exist in a third a. tridentata subspecies, but a true polyploid hybrid of these the two diploid subspecies would contain both alleles of all snps. thus, the ssp. wyomingensis samples used here were likely derived from different diploids and those individuals had significantly different genotypes than those used for est sequencing. 3) using sequence capture, only 54% of the  <dig> snp positions were validated as discriminatory between ssp. tridentata and ssp. vaseyana, but 67% of the snp positions had both bases detected. thus, 13% of the sequence capture validated snp positions also appeared to be heterogeneous  within the collected individuals used for sequence capture. indeed, a significant number of snps were found between individual plants within a. tridentata subspecies. much of this nucleotide diversity at initially identified snp loci could be at heterozygous loci, though we are careful not to describe it as such until allelism between nucleotide residues is fully established through segregation analysis. recall that these est sequences contain both coding and non-coding sequence . a high level of nucleotide diversity in these coding and non-coding sequences is certainly plausible considering the very large effective population size of big sagebrush and wind-pollination strategy  <cit> .

given the high level of heterozygosity due to the out-crossing nature of big sagebrush populations  <cit> , we expect that a large number of inter-subspecific snps and intra-subspecific snps could be used in conducting subspecies level association genetics studies. to date, little or no sequence of big sagebrush has been made publicly available, thus the snps reported here represent a starting point for such future population genetic studies of big sagebrush. while they may form the basis of future molecular studies, caution is needed because informative snp comparisons will depend on the specific individuals selected for genetic analysis. alternatively, our study suggests that a sequenced based approach to population genetics such as a population-wide genome reduction strategy  <cit>  or amplicon analysis should be considered because of the expense required for assay development and their potential use in few, specific a. tridentata individuals. such an approach would avoid extrapolation of our putative snps specific to these individuals to a larger population of individuals  by generating accession-specific data for each newly sequenced accession. implementation of such study among spatially distributed big sagebrush populations would 1) enlighten our understanding of natural selection on genes and gene complexes controlling adaptive traits, and the evolution of these trait-linked loci and 2) provide relatedness metrics between natural populations of these subspecies and their hybrid zones. though we briefly touched on these questions by using independent genotypes for snp validation, these questions are out of the scope of this particular study that aims to primarily characterize est sequences of big sagebrush and provide insight regarding the origins of ssp. wyomingensis.

regarding the discovered ssrs, we were surprised to find that all ssr repeat motif types detected were much more abundant in ssp. tridentata compared to ssp. vaseyana. the reduced levels of ssr in ssp. vaseyana ests compared to ssp. tridentata could be due to differential gene expression since different loci were sampled with our non-replicated experimental design. while leaves from both plants were harvested at the same time in common garden, phenological differences between the subspecies might have caused differences in expression levels and thus, changes in the number and types of detected ssrs. while gene expression could explain some of the differences, many such est-ssrs have been found to be reliable molecular markers in other species  <cit>  and they represent hypothetical  genetic divergences between the subspecies.

ka/ks and gene evolution in big sagebrush
the ratio of synonymous and non-synonymous mutations between sspp. tridentata and vaseyana suggest possible selection pressure resulting in the maintenance of subspecies divergence, as similar trends have been observed in various organisms  <cit> . since natural selection shapes phenotypes and genotypes in favor of adapted traits, the ka/ks ratio of less than  <dig> for a large number of contigs could be a result of either stabilizing or diversifying selection within both subspecies, depending upon the magnitude of the ratio. or if divergence times are very recent, it could also be the hallmark of purifying selection on the adapted common ancestor of these two subspecies. for example, contig_ <dig>  was annotated for 'aquaporin' protein. considering that big sagebrush grows in variety of soils and arid plains, valleys and foothills of mountains, the importance of aquaporin proteins in water balance is critical and the genes coding for aquaporin proteins could have been under stabilizing selection. a formal investigation of molecular evolution within these species  would place selection pressure relative to species divergence.

exploring the inter-subspecies hybridization hypothesis
hybridization can be of great importance to the ecological adaptation and subsequent evolution of offspring because of the novel genetic recombination and spatial selection  <cit> . generally, allopolyploid formation is considered to have arisen through hybridization between unreduced gametes  <cit> . several studies have been conducted on hybrid populations formed from a. t. ssp. tridentata and a. t. ssp. vaseyana to investigate hybridization events. generally, these hybrid populations are formed in a narrow zone between the two ecotypes  <cit> . in this study, we did not select a tetraploid ssp. wyomingensis along with diploid representatives of its two neighboring ssp. tridentata and ssp. vaseyana populations. instead, selected ssp. tridentata and ssp. vaseyana accessions were chosen for est sequencing based on penetrance of specific, subspecies morphological markers . thus, variation at snp loci for the diploid-tetraploid comparison is a mixture of individual variation, variation within inter-mating populations, and variation between subspecies in this study. based on the number of illumina reads that actually did map to discriminating snps between sspp. tridentata and vaseyana, the tetraploid ssp. wyomingensis samples appeared to contain both alleles for a large number of loci . the presence of both alleles at approximately one-third of the loci suggests that ssp. wyomingensis either originated as an allotetraploid from a hybridization event of  <dig> n gametes between sspp. tridentata and vaseyena or formed as a autopolyploid from both diploid subspecies with subsequent hybridization. since allopolyploids have been reported between diploids and tetraploids of ssp. tridentata and ssp. vaseyena  <cit> , a similar scenario is plausible for the origin of ssp. wyomingensis. a focused genetic study within and between putative hybrid zones of big sagebrush is needed to further elucidate the origins and reproducibility of hybridization processes involved in ssp. wyomingensis formation. if tetraploid recurrence is a common feature of ssp. wyomingensis, perhaps only populations of ssp. tridentata and ssp. vaseyana need active management during environmental conversation of wildlands because a tetraploid hybrid between the two locally adapted accessions could be expected to form and repopulate geographic zones between the diploid subspecies.

CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first of its kind to perform transcriptome sequencing of big sagebrush subspecies, generating large selections of genetic resources  for this ecologically important group of range and forest plants. the est sequences were annotated to identify putative gene functions, and select genes involved in putative terpenoid and coumarin synthesis were bioinformatically identified. the distribution of snps among a. tridentata subspecies and the estimation of depth and divergence of mutations provide insights about the magnitude of neutral divergence and natural selection between these subspecies, and a foundation of sequence references for future population genomic and functional genetic studies. the cost-effective, rapid and reliable way of obtaining nuclear sequences through transcriptome sequencing also provided insights on gene divergence and marker development in big sagebrush. future studies integrating common garden, provenance and reciprocal transplantation of defined genetic stocks with this genomic information will immeasurably add to our understanding patterns of genes and their roles in adaptive traits among big sagebrush populations.
