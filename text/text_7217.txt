BACKGROUND
molecular genetic linkage maps have become a major tool in genetics, genomics and breeding of plant and animal species. linkage maps provide opportunities for unlocking the complex genetics of quantitatively inherited traits through the localization of quantitative trait loci , identification and positional cloning of individual genes, development of genome-wide physical maps, assembly and annotation of whole genome sequence, and serve as a repository of markers useful in marker-assisted breeding  of crop and animal species. among the most informative maps for mab are those constructed using parent genotypes directly involved in breeding programs.

peach is one of the best genetically characterized species in the rosaceae family  <cit> , and the most economically important crop in prunus  <cit> , a genus that also includes nectarine, plum, apricot, cherry, and almond. the small genome size and expanding genomic resources of peach highlight peach as a model species for genomics studies of tree fruits  <cit> . details of these genetic and genomic resources are updated and described on the genomic database for rosaceae   <cit> .

while numerous prunus species linkage maps have been published, the interspecific linkage map  developed from an interspecific cross of almond  with peach  is the most saturated of all these linkage maps  <cit> . due to this saturation, a high degree of polymorphism, and extensive co-linearity and synteny among prunus genomes  <cit> , research community consensus has established the t × e map as the reference map for all prunus species. the most recent published version of the t × e map contains  <dig> markers spanning  <dig> cm with an average density of  <dig>  cm per marker  <cit> . building on the reference status of t × e, a bin-mapping strategy was developed  <cit> . in this technique, recombination patterns in six progeny of the t × e mapping population were used to reduce the prunus genome to  <dig> "bins" of  <dig>  cm average length and to further populate the reference map with an additional  <dig> microsatellite-derived markers  <cit> . other interspecific prunus linkage maps were derived from almond 'padre' × peach selection 54p <dig>  <cit> , and myrobalan plum clone p. <dig> × almond-peach hybrid clone gn <dig>  <cit> . interspecific maps are easily saturated with markers due to the high level of polymorphism between parent genotypes. however, they are limited in their immediate applicability to cultivar improvement via mas when compared to intraspecific maps because markers that are polymorphic between species are often not polymorphic within species. this is especially true for peach which has a narrow genetic base  <cit> . reported intraspecific prunus linkage maps include those of almond  <cit> , apricot  <cit> , sweet cherry  <cit> , and peach  <cit> . the ultimate stated goal of most linkage map construction efforts for prunus crop species is the development of breeder-friendly mab tools. potential benefits of mab are particularly great for these crop species because of their long juvenility and requirements for large field planting spaces.

the concept of fruit quality of prunus fruit crops includes both its attainment, such changes in color, flavor, and texture as fruit develop, grow, and ripen, and its maintenance following harvest from the tree as the perishable tissues senesce. prunus fruit development, growth, ripening, and senescence includes major biochemical and sensory changes in texture, color, and flavor. the genetic dissection of these complex processes has important applications in crop improvement, to facilitate maximizing and maintaining stone fruit quality from production and processing through to marketing and consumption.

the goal of the present study was to develop a genomic resource to facilitate the genetic dissection of prunus fruit quality traits. this paper reports the genetic mapping in the prunus genome of candidate genes for fruit texture, pigmentation, flavor, and cold-responsiveness of peach, using both an intraspecific peach population to create a linkage map for genetic analyses of fruit quality and chilling injury , and the interspecific prunus reference map. the utility of the "fruit quality gene map" developed here for prunus is demonstrated by highlighting co-localization of fruit quality qtls with mapped fruit quality candidate genes.

RESULTS
morphological markers
peach blossom petals can be large and showy or small and curved on margins . non-showy is dominant to showy  <cit> . 'dr. davis' and 'georgia belle' are both heterozygous and therefore non-showy for this locus. pop-dg progeny segregated as  <dig> non-showy:  <dig> showy, fitting the expected mendelian ratio of 3: <dig> . this trait was designated sh and mapped to the middle of linkage group g <dig> of pop-dg and flanked by ssr marker cppct <dig> at  <dig> cm above and ci resistance cg marker unk <dig> at  <dig>  cm below. segregation and mapping of the peach mesocarp color  and the freestone melting flesh  loci have been reported previously for pop-dg  <cit> .

molecular marker polymorphism in pop-dg
three types of reproducible marker polymorphism were observed on the page profiles of the cg pcr products: fragment size polymorphism of the targeted gene fragments, additional markers that were designated as "cg accessory markers" generated elsewhere in the profile than the main cg fragments, and single strand conformation polymorphism . under the conditions used for page, some reproducible sharp or shadowy banding patterns were observed in association with the target pcr product. we have proved this to be mobility shifts characteristic of sscp resulting from snps within the amplicons  <cit> . the sscp phenomenon also occurred for many ssrs .

of all  <dig> ssr primer pairs screened for polymorphism in pop-dg,  <dig>  were polymorphic and produced  <dig> ssr markers . polymorphism was higher in the  <dig> genomic ssrs  than in the  <dig> est-ssrs . of the  <dig> novel chillpeach est-ssrs tested in pop-dg,  <dig>  were polymorphic, on par with the public est-ssr polymorphism. the remaining  <dig> chillpeach est-ssrs were screened on the t × e bin set, out of which  <dig>  were polymorphic. approximately 13% and 18% polymorphism was obtained for ci resistance cgs and other cgs in pop-dg, respectively, while 71% and 86% polymorphism was obtained in t × e, respectively . marker polymorphism in pop-dg was therefore at least four to five times less than in t × e for all classes of marker tested.

pop-dg linkage map
the pop-dg intraspecific peach linkage map contained a total of  <dig> markers  distributed over eight linkage groups corresponding to the haploid chromosome number of peach . the map covered  <dig>  cm of the peach genome with an average of  <dig>  cm interval between markers. the markers on pop-dg map consisted of three mendelian trait loci,  <dig> cgs,  <dig> ssrs,  <dig> rafs,  <dig> sraps,  <dig> imas, and  <dig> cg accessory markers associated with cgs. of the  <dig> ssr markers on pop-dg,  <dig> were shared with the published prunus t × e reference map . these common markers enabled the determination of linkage group orientation and assignment of linkage group numbers for the pop-dg map. shared markers were co-linear between pop-dg and t × e except in three cases. marker positions for bppct <dig>  bppct <dig>  and pchgms <dig> were inverted at the lower end of linkage group g <dig> of pop-dg compared to g <dig> of t × e, positions of bppct <dig> and udp96- <dig> were inverted in the middle of g <dig> of pop-dg compared to g <dig> of t × e, and positions of bppct <dig> and cppct <dig> were inverted towards the upper end of g <dig> of pop-dg compared to g <dig> of t × e. one ssr marker  that was originally placed on linkage group g <dig> of t × e  <cit>  mapped to the distal end of g <dig> in pop-dg. to resolve this discrepancy, bppct <dig> was tested on the t × e bin set which confirmed its true location in bin 1: <dig> , corresponding to its position on the pop-dg linkage map.

the features of cgs mapped to pop-dg are presented in table  <dig>  eleven markers were derived from fruit quality-related cgs , seven of which were texture cgs. one of these texture cgs, endopg , mapped to linkage group g <dig> as previously reported . the others were two pectin methylesterases  on g <dig> and g <dig>  another polygalacturonase  on g <dig>  pectate lyase  on g <dig>  alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase  on g <dig>  and a mads box transcription factor similar to tomato ripening inhibitor  on g <dig>  three pigmentation cgs mapped to pop-dg. these were beta-carotene hydroxylase  on g <dig>  leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase  on g <dig> as previously reported by ogundiwin et al. , and zeaxanthin epoxidase  on g <dig>  a flavor cg for sucrose phosphate synthase  mapped to g <dig>  thirteen mapped pop-dg gene markers were obtained from ci resistance cgs. seven of these have functional annotation: aux/iaa protein  on g <dig>  chloroplast nucleoid dna binding  on g <dig>  thaumatin-like protein <dig> precursor  on g <dig>  serine protease-like protein  on g <dig>  tonoplast intrinsic protein  on g <dig>  indole-3-acetic acid-induced protein arg <dig>  on g <dig>  and sulfate transporter  on g <dig>  the other six had no functional annotation  on g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  and two on g <dig>  some dominant markers were generated from accessory fragments amplified alongside major amplicons of a few candidate genes . seventeen of such markers were mapped to pop-dg.

a: cirg = chilling injury resistance genes

features of the  <dig> chillpeach ests that produced  <dig> est-ssrs mapped to pop-dg are provided . eight of these have annotated functions: two zinc finger-ring type, thioredoxin domain  <dig>  poz/btb containing protein, biotin synthase, lysine ketoglutarate reductase, transfactor-like protein, trna intron endonuclease, and farnesyltransferase beta subunit. other chillpeach est-ssrs on pop-dg have no known functional annotation.

bin-mapping cgs and chillpeach est-ssrs to the prunus reference t × e map
the bin-mapping technique developed for the prunus t × e reference map enabled the mapping of  <dig> markers that were monomorphic in pop-dg . these included  <dig> cgs and  <dig> novel chillpeach est-ssrs. the bin-mapped cgs included  <dig> texture and nine pigmentation cgs. all markers mapped to  <dig> of the  <dig> t × e bins. approximately  <dig> of the  <dig> bin-mapped chillpeach est-ssr markers  were derived from ests with known go annotations . others were unknown.

discussion
we have developed a detailed fruit quality and ripening gene map for prunus. the fruit quality gene map contains  <dig> candidate genes  implicated in fruit ripening, softening, flavor, and pigmentation, and chilling injury resistance. the pop-dg peach map is almost entirely co-linear with the prunus reference t × e map such that locations of markers and quantitative trait loci  located on pop-dg can be readily cross-referenced to t × e and other prunus maps aligned to t × e. similarly, markers and qtls in other prunus maps  can be compared to the prunus fruit quality gene map to identify genes controlling fruit ripening and sensory quality.

co-linearity between pop-dg and t × e maps
using a reference genetic map with available bin-mapping resources to map genes and other dna sequences not polymorphic within crop-specific maps is a powerful means of identifying marker-trait associations. the degree of resolution offered by bin-mapping in t × e  is at the same scale as typical qtl mapping, such that detection of co-location  of candidate genes with previously mapped qtls is readily achievable. the remarkable conservation of co-linearity among the genomes of prunus species  <cit>  was exploited by bin-mapping to the t × e reference map many cgs that were monomorphic in pop-dg. the higher rate of polymorphism observed in t × e compared to pop-dg is not surprising because t × e is an f <dig> population from an interspecific cross. pop-dg's polymorphism results from a relatively high heterozygosity in 'georgia belle' compared to modern cultivars, low heterozygosity in 'dr. davis' arising from a pedigree of closely related yellow non-melting canning peaches, and divergent breeding histories of these two parent cultivars. we expect that intraspecific peach populations derived from modern cultivars within the same market type  will display even less polymorphism than pop-dg. inversion of marker positions observed between pop-dg and t × e in three locations  were among marker pairs that were close together on the t × e map , suggesting that they are more probably caused by errors in the assignment of marker order than to inversion of chromosome fragments  <cit> .

simply inherited traits mapped to pop-dg
markers on the pop-dg linkage map included three simply-inherited mendelian quality and morphological traits: freestone/clingstone and melting flesh/non-melting flesh , mesocarp color , and non-showy flower petals . the sh locus mapped to linkage group g <dig> of pop-dg. this is the first report of its genomic location since its inheritance was elucidated in the early to mid 1940s. confirmation of its location on g <dig> is emerging from some unpublished results . this is the only mendelian trait mapped to g <dig> of prunus to date. linkage group g <dig> has proved difficult to map in some intraspecific peach mapping efforts  <cit> . in this report also, g <dig> was the linkage group with fewest number of markers. this could partly explain why it took so long to determine the genomic location of the sh locus. the f-m  and y  loci are among the list of  <dig> simply-inherited mendelian traits mapped to prunus genome in prior studies  <cit> , and their locations are confirmed in pop-dg.

novel prunus est-ssr markers
seventy new prunus est-ssr markers were mapped either directly to pop-dg  or bin-mapped to the t × e reference map . the markers were obtained from the chillpeach est database  <cit> . the chillpeach database is a specialized collection of ests from peach mesocarp tissue subjected to cold storage and ripening. the new set of mapped est-ssr markers provides additional resources for molecular marker analyses in prunus species.

identity of mapped cgs
cg sequence identities were confirmed for endopg  <cit> , ppldox  <cit> , and rin , where fragment lengths and dna sequence of amplicons corresponded to original est sequences. the identity of remaining cgs was confirmed by fragment length, where the most intense amplicons were either the expected size  or were 80- <dig> bp larger presumably due to the inclusion of one or more introns . identity of cg amplicons was also supported in many cases by previously reported map locations . further validation via sequencing would be desirable for the remaining cgs, and is the next recommended step for pursuit of specific qtl candidates for fruit quality traits of interest.

comparing locations of cgs bin-mapped on t × e to other prunus maps
several previously mapped fruit candidate genes in prunus corresponded to their genome locations in the present study. the locations of three cgs bin-mapped to t × e in this study corresponded to a previous interspecific 'padre' × 54p <dig> map  <cit> . catalase was mapped as an isozyme locus  to the top of linkage group g <dig> of the 'padre' × 54p <dig> map. we bin-mapped this texture cg to t × e bin 5: <dig>  in earlier studies, the peach fruit acidity locus  was mapped to the top of g <dig>  <cit>  and a tight linkage between cat <dig> and the d locus was also reported  <cit> . another isozyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase, was mapped as icd to the top of linkage group g <dig> of 'padre' × 54p <dig>  <cit>  and as icdh <dig> to t × e  <cit> , and we bin-mapped this flavor cg as icdh to t × e bin 3: <dig>  dehydrin was mapped as dhn <dig> and dehy <dig> to the middle of group g <dig> of 'padre' × 54p <dig>  <cit>  and t × e , respectively.

the gene encoding polygalacturonase inhibiting protein  mapped to different locations in the two studies; it mapped to g <dig> in 'padre' × 54p <dig> and to g <dig> on t × e. different members of the pgip gene family may have been mapped in the two separate studies. another independent study bin-mapped the genes endopg  to bin 4: <dig>  aco <dig>  to 3: <dig>  aco <dig>  to 4: <dig>  and pg <dig>  to 8: <dig> to t × e  <cit> . pg <dig> was also mapped as isozyme pg to the same end of g <dig> in an almond linkage map  <cit> . pepc was mapped as pepc in a 'ferjalou jalousia' × 'fantasia' map  <cit>  in the same region as our pepc . these authors  <cit>  also reported the location of another ten candidate genes for sweetness and acidity, and a different expansin gene to those mapped here, to various locations on a peach map using the t × e population. three further fruit quality cgs were mapped in a separate study  <cit> : nadp dependent sorbitol 6-phosphate dehydrogenase  for sweetness to bin 8: <dig>  h+ atpase  for sweetness/acidity to bin 1: <dig>  and endo-beta- <dig> -glucanase for texture to bin 5: <dig> . additional fruit quality candidate genes have been located in the prunus genome during hybridization-based efforts to physically map peach ests  <cit> .

co-locations of candidate genes and chilling injury qtls
the co-linearity between the pop-dg and t × e maps has begun to yield benefits in dissecting the genetic control of fruit quality traits in peach. we are using the fruit quality gene map to better understand the genetics of resistance to chilling injury, particularly focusing on the major symptoms of mealiness, browning, and bleeding. at least two cases of co-localizations of chilling injury qtls and cgs mapped to pop-dg/t × e were previously reported: endopg on g <dig> with major qtls for mealiness and bleeding  <cit>  as well as to the freestone-melting flesh locus  <cit>  and ppldox on g <dig> with cold storage-induced browning  <cit> .

mealiness
a peach homolog of tomato mads-rin ripening inhibitor gene , necessary for fruit ripening in tomato, mapped close  to endopg. two rin accessory markers  also mapped distally to endopg. the functional role of rin in peach fruit ripening, mealiness, or bleeding has not yet been established. four additional minor qtls were reported for mealiness in pop-dg corresponding approximately to t × e bins 4: <dig>  4:22-4: <dig>  4: <dig>  and 6:80-6: <dig>  <cit> . we mapped one texture cg  to bin 4: <dig>  one ci resistance cg  to bin 4: <dig>  two ci resistance cgs  to bin 4: <dig>  and two ci resistance cgs  to bins 6:80-6: <dig>  aco <dig> encodes 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase, a critical enzyme in ethylene biosynthesis. tat  is an inducible protein in the plant methyl jasmonate defense system  <cit> . unk <dig>  unk <dig>  unk <dig>  and unk <dig> are genes of unknown functions that were differentially regulated in cold-treated peach mesocarp tissue  <cit> . each of these cgs are potential markers for mealiness resistance and warrant further investigation.

flesh browning
some cgs mapped to locations where qtls have been reported for cold storage-induced flesh browning in peach fruit. a major browning qtl was located on linkage group g <dig> of pop-dg corresponding to bin 5: <dig> of t × e  <cit> . ppldox , which was initially mapped to this bin, was later fine-mapped to pop-dg, and evidence of its association with browning was established  <cit> . the two minor browning qtls reported on linkage group g <dig> of pop-dg  <cit>  correspond roughly to bins 2:08-2: <dig> and 2:20-2: <dig> of t × e map. four ripening cgs  and one pigmentation cg  mapped to bin 2: <dig>  and one ci resistance cg  mapped to bin 2: <dig>  also one ripening cg  and one ci resistance cg  mapped to bin 2: <dig>  pl <dig> , gal <dig> , and exp <dig>  are cell wall-degrading enzymes while erp  is an ethylene-related protein. unk <dig> is a protein of unknown function which was up-regulated by ethylene in peach mesocarp tissue  <cit> . nxce  is an abscisic acid biosynthesis gene that acts by oxidative cleavage of a carotenoid neoxanthin  <cit> . o-6fad  and rhb <dig>  were up-regulated in cold-treated peach mesocarp tissue  <cit> . these cgs may be useful markers for developing resistance to cold-induced browning in stone fruit.

cold-induced bleeding
in addition to the major qtl detected in peach fruit at the f-m/endopg locus on g <dig> of pop-dg, two minor qtls were also reported for cold-induced bleeding on pop-dg linkage group g <dig>  <cit> , corresponding to t × e bins 1: <dig> and 1: <dig>  a texture cg  and a ci resistance cg  mapped close to the minor bleeding qtl peak at the top end of g <dig>  two texture cgs  and four ci resistance cgs  mapped to bin 1: <dig>  while pccao  and unk <dig>  mapped to bin 1: <dig>  pl <dig> , pme <dig> , and ara <dig>  are cell wall-degrading enzymes  <cit> . ppcao  catalyzes the oxidation of amines to aldehyde, ammonia and hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . cipk <dig> , involved in plant calcium signaling  <cit> , pdk <dig> , c-coar , unk <dig>  and unk <dig> were up-regulated in cold-treated mesocarp tissue of peach  <cit> . these cgs will be further investigated for possible roles in the formation of bleeding and developing bleeding-free peach cultivars.

inferred co-locations of candidate genes and other published fruit quality traits
several cgs mapped to genomic regions corresponding to fruit quality qtls reported in other studies. examples are those reported by  <cit>  and  <cit> .

putative candidate genes for fruit quality qtls on p <dig> × 'summergrand' map  <cit> 
on linkage group g <dig> qtls were detected by  <cit>  for fructose , sweetness , quinic acid , fruit cheek diameter , fruit mass , and fruit suture diameter  in the region corresponding to the t × e bin 1: <dig> on which we bin-mapped polyub  and unk6; qtls for citric acid  and total sugar  in the region equivalent to bin 1: <dig> of t × e on which we bin-mapped samdc , unk <dig>  4cl , c- <dig> , c-ppn36e <dig>  c-ppn73a08; qtls for total sugar  and quinic acid  in the region corresponding to bin 1:52-1: <dig> of t × e where we bin-mapped chitb , unk <dig> and sreb . notable among these gene markers are those encoding sucrose-responsive element binding protein  and phosphogluconolactonase  for their possible involvement in sugar biosynthesis  <cit>  and inducible expression  <cit> , respectively. in addition,  <cit>  localized qtls for sucrose , glucose , and quinic acid  on linkage group g <dig> region comparable to bin 7: <dig> of t × e containing bin-mapped cg asps . the expression of asps has been shown to increase with a decrease in sucrose levels  <cit> .

the following qtls were also detected for peach fruit quality on linkage group g <dig> by  <cit> : fruit mass , fruit polar diameter , soluble solid concentrate  and juiciness  on a region corresponding to bin 4: <dig> of t × e on which aco <dig> and c- <dig>  were bin-mapped; and citric acid , quinic acid , total acid , sorbitol , fructose  and malic acid  on a region equivalent to bin 4: <dig> - 4: <dig> of t × e on which were bin-mapped unk <dig>  unk <dig>  c- <dig>  and tat . the authors also localized the following peach fruit quality qtls on linkage group g5: glucose , fruit suture diameter , and fruit cheek diameter , as well as the major locus controlling fruit acidity, d, on a region corresponding approximately to bin 5: <dig> of t × e on which we bin-mapped pae <dig>  pae <dig>  and cat1; red skin coloration , dry flesh mass content , soluble solid concentrate , fruit mass , fruit polar diameter , and fruit suture diameter  on bin 5:46-5: <dig> of t × e on which pl, c-pp03c <dig>  and c-ppn05e <dig>  were bin-mapped. sulfe-related proteins have been implicated in fe-s metabolism and export  <cit> .

putative candidate genes for fruit quality qtls on 'ferjalou jalousia' × 'fantasia' map  <cit> 
a number of fruit quality qtls  were detected by  <cit>  on linkage group g <dig> of 'ferjalou jalousia' × 'fantasia' map, on the region corresponding to bin 6:74-6: <dig> of the t × e linkage map. to this bin, we mapped agat , cdtpl , sod4a , unk <dig>  unk <dig>  c- <dig> , c- <dig>  c-ppn12c <dig>  c-ppn19b <dig>  and c-ppn31e <dig> . glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase is an important enzyme in biosynthesis of amino sugar-containing macromolecules  <cit> . also on linkage group g <dig>  dirlewanger et al  localized qtls for ssc and fructose to a region equivalent to the t × e bin 4: <dig>  the candidate genes mapped to this bin were secy , samm , and gppde .

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a fruit quality gene map for prunus by determining the genomic locations of  <dig> fruit quality candidate genes with an intraspecific peach population, pop-dg, and the prunus reference map, t × e. sufficient ssr marker anchoring between both maps allowed easy cross-referencing of marker and trait locus positions. we demonstrate here the use of this gene map for dissecting the molecular genetics of ci in peach. using the results of microarray experiments that studied gene expression in cold-treated peach mesocarp tissue,  <dig> cold-responsive genes were located on the fruit quality gene map, allowing the detection of co-locations of these ci resistance cgs with qtls for ci symptoms. we also highlight new cgs for previously reported prunus qtls of other fruit quality traits. the fruit quality gene map presented here is expected to be a valuable resource for the genetic analysis of fruit ripening and related fruit quality traits in prunus species.
