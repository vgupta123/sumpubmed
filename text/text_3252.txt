BACKGROUND
vascular plants have a well developed translocation system that facilitates transport of nutrients and particularly photoassimilates between organs. this vascular system is comprised of phloem and xylem conducting elements. the phloem vascular tissue in angiosperms is comprised of arrays of sieve element /companion cell  complexes  <cit> . during their differentiation, the se undergoes a selective autophagy which results in breakdown of the nucleus and tonoplast along with loss of ribosomes, golgi and microtubules. consequently, mature se exhibit mostly a thin layer of parietal cytoplasm with stacked endoplasmic reticulum, some plastids and a small number of dilated mitochondria  <cit> . it is generally believed that the enucleate se has lost the capacity for protein synthesis and has limited metabolic activity. cc must then participate in the maintenance and functioning of the enucleate se  <cit> . adjacent se and cc are connected through branched plasmodesmata responsible for the exchange of small solutes and macromolecules in the se/cc complex  <cit> . thus, macromolecules identified in the mature se are assumed to have been synthesized in and imported from an associated cc through plasmodesmatal connection  <cit> .

proteomic analyses of phloem exudates collected from incisions to the vasculature of a number of species that either 'bleed' spontaneously , or, in which exudation is aided by application of a chelator have shown a broad range of proteins, a small number of which are common with those identified in phloem exudate collected by stylectomy  <cit> . while together these data indicate that the phloem stream contains many proteins, it is not clear which of these are translocated and, more importantly, which have a function dependent on their long distance transport.

numerous transcripts have been identified in phloem exudates collected not only from incisions to the vasculature in arabidopsis  <cit> , melon  <cit> , and castor bean  <cit>  but also by stylectomy from rice  <cit>  and barley  <cit> . the presence of transcripts in phloem exudate suggests the concept of an rna-based signalling network that functions in the control of plant development  <cit> . however, there are few transcripts for which translocation has been demonstrated and the need for translocation established  <cit> .

functional analysis of proteins and transcripts identified in phloem exudates revealed a wide range of processes including metabolism, responses to stress, transport, detoxification of reactive oxygen species , dna/rna binding, signalling and protein turnover. recent studies have also revealed the presence of small rna molecules, including micrornas , in phloem exudates from cucurbits  <cit> , brassica napus  <cit> , and malus domestica   <cit> . there is a growing body of evidence linking mirnas to the regulation of nutritional balance in plants and particularly to changes in pi and n status  <cit>  and to s uptake  <cit> . these nutrients are translocated and distributed in organs as a consequence of 'source- sink interactions' raising the possibility that translocated mirnas are involved in regulating these interactions.

while proteomic and rna analysis of phloem exudates has been applied successfully to a number of dicotyledon species and, with the aid of sap sucking insects, to rice, barley, and apple, similar detailed analyses of proteins and rna in exudates from legume species have been lacking. the ability to collect phloem exudates, both readily and in substantial volume from white lupin, without the use of a chelating agent, provides a valuable tool for studying the macromolecular composition of such exudates in a legume. in this study, partial sequence determination by ms/ms and subsequent protein database searches, were used to tentatively identify proteins separated using 2d gel electrophoresis from lupin phloem exudate collected mainly from developing fruits and the inflorescence raceme. these exudates were also analysed for rna species including transcripts and mirnas.

this is the first study to provide information on macromolecules present in the phloem exudate of a member of the fabaceae. the information obtained adds further insights into the properties of the se/cc complex and provides a basis for future studies seeking to identify potential systemic signals that may play a role in a communication network trafficking information around the plant, regulating specific developmental processes and responding to environmental cues.

RESULTS
lupin phloem exudates contain many proteins
separation of proteins on 2d gels permitted resolution of more than  <dig> coomassie-staining spots . of these,  <dig> were collected and partially sequenced by ms/ms. representative spectra for a number of spots are shown in additional file  <dig>  proteins from  <dig> spots were tentatively identified by the high level of identity of two or more peptides to sequences in current databases . for many spots an exact match to a deduced protein from a lupin est was made. an additional  <dig> spots had single peptide matches to a known protein or a protein encoded by a lupin est. these identifications were treated with caution but are included here to show the possible components of phloem. additional file  <dig> shows the full list of identified proteins as well as the partial amino acid sequences used for identification and the blast search results. the  <dig> proteins with peptide matches corresponded to  <dig> unique accession numbers as some of the identified proteins were present in more than one spot. of the sequenced proteins, 37% were classified as 'unknown' . this group included nine spots that contained peptides either at too low concentration or that exhibited adverse fragmentation behaviour resulting in poor spectra that were difficult to interpret, and  <dig> spots showing no significant homology to any protein in the database or that matched proteins of an unknown function. some of the more prominent protein spots  were in this latter category. the prominent proteins that were identified included cyclophilin , a glycine-rich rna-binding protein , and a cysteine proteinase inhibitor .

a large number of transcripts are present in lupin phloem exudate
a total of  <dig> clones were sequenced from a cdna library constructed from mrna isolated from phloem exudate. of these sequences,  <dig> were excluded due to low quality of the sequence and  <dig> ests did not show significant similarity to any sequence in the databases searched. a total of  <dig> unique transcripts corresponding to  <dig> ests were identified . 73% of all ests were singletons.  <dig> redundant est sequences were assembled into  <dig> contigs with an average of  <dig>  ests per contig. additional file  <dig> shows the full list of sequenced clones as well as the blast search results.

because the phloem exudates were collected from shallow incisions made to the vasculature it is likely that cells other than se were also damaged and their contents, including proteins and transcripts, added to those from the se in the accumulating exudate. to assess the extent that exudate collected from the fruit suture vasculature might be contaminated a number of transcripts were assayed by real time rt-qpcr in both exudate and extracts from the surrounding, non-suture, pod tissue. these included actin, ubiquitin, sam synthetase, aquaporin, chlorophyll a/b binding protein, small subunit  of rubisco, flowering locus t and sucrose synthase. the expression for each transcript in pod tissue extracts was set to  <dig>  and the levels of transcript in exudate expressed as a proportion of  <dig>   so that the relative abundance of expression in the pod wall could be compared to that in phloem exudate for each transcript. the pattern of abundance of transcripts relative to one another in exudate did not reflect the relative levels of expression of this group of transcripts in pod tissue.

proteins and transcripts identified in lupin phloem exudates are involved in diverse biochemical processes
proteins and transcripts were grouped by putative function . the largest group of tentatively identified proteins comprised those involved in metabolism , followed by protein modification/turnover , redox regulation , cell structural components  and stress and defence response , with fewer numbers in the other groups . transcripts coding for proteins with unknown functions formed the largest category . all proteins with insufficient functional information were classified in this category. the largest groups of transcripts coding for proteins with known functions were metabolism with 15% of all ests , protein modification/ turnover with 11% of all ests, and redox regulation, signalling and stress response and defence-related with 5% of all ests each. a group of  <dig> sequences  were classified as viral proteins exclusively encoding the polyprotein of bean yellow mosaic virus. transcripts encoding proteins with multiple or unclear function were grouped as 'unclassified'  . for  <dig> of the transcripts that were identified their corresponding protein was also detected in phloem exudate . additional file  <dig> shows the full list of sequenced cdna clones and their functional classification.

cloning small rnas
small rna was isolated from phloem exudate and those in the  <dig> to  <dig> nt size class were purified and used to construct a small rna library. the sequences of  <dig> small rnas from the phloem were obtained. these small rnas ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nt, although the majority were  <dig> to  <dig> nt. comparison with those in the mirbase  <cit>  identified  <dig> sequences from the phloem library with strong similarity to known mirnas from seven different families . however, many of these were shorter than the similar mirna in other plants suggesting some may have been degraded during the isolation and cloning procedure.

a 

distribution of mirnas in white lupin tissues and phloem exudate
northern analysis showed  <dig> mirnas previously detected in arabidopsis and rice also present in white lupin. most of the mirnas were detected in a range of tissues and eight  were detected in phloem exudate . the probe for mir169-like was based on the sequence similar to mir <dig> that was cloned from lupin. mir169-like, mir <dig> and mir <dig> accumulated predominantly in phloem. mir <dig>  which was not detected in phloem in other studies, was not present in lupin phloem either, although the hybridization for this mirna in figure 4a is weak. the lack of mir <dig> in lupin phloem exudate was confirmed using a second blot . hybridization with nine other probes for mirnas was done but none showed a signal in white lupin phloem exudate .

in some cases, mirnas of two sizes were detected. for example, the probe complementary to mir <dig> recognised rna approximately  <dig> nt long in young leaf, seedlings and phloem exudate while rna detected in seeds, flowers, nodules, roots and stems was only  <dig> nt. the probe complementary to mir <dig> detected both  <dig> and  <dig> nt rnas in all tissues. the mir <dig> in phloem also showed two hybridising bands one at  <dig> nt and a less significant one at ca  <dig> nt . this corresponded to the size of an  <dig> nt sequence similar to mir <dig> cloned from phloem exudate.

distribution of mirnas in phloem exudate collected from different sites on the plant
northern analysis of rna extracted from phloem exudate collected from the base of the stem, developing pods, and from secondary  and tertiary  axillary inflorescence branches  was used to determine the distribution of mirnas within exudate at different sites on the plant. probes complementary to nine of the mirnas gave different strength hybridisation signals when bound to rna from exudate collected from these three sites. probes complementary to mir <dig> and mir <dig> gave the strongest hybridisation signal when bound to pod exudate rna and weaker signals when bound to rna from exudate collected at the base and branches at the top of the plant . however, probes complementary to mir <dig>  gave a weaker hybridisation signal in pod exudate rna than in rna from exudate at the stem base and from the upper axillary branches . probes complementary to mir <dig> and mir <dig> gave the weakest signals when hybridised to rna from exudate collected from the top of the plant and stronger signals when hybridised to rna from pod exudate and exudate from the base of the stem . consistent with findings from hybridisation experiments to determine the distribution of mirnas in lupin tissues , the probe complementary to mir <dig> gave two strong hybridisation signals in exudate rna at  <dig> and  <dig> nt. the hybridisation signals were approximately equal for all three exudate samples.

the abundance of a number of mirnas detected in phloem exudate was measured using real time rt-qpcr and the relative abundance compared to adjacent pod tissue was determined . the pcr analysis used primers for mir399d whereas in the northern analysis  the probe was degenerate and would have picked up a range of mir399s. the relative levels of this group of mirnas were quite different in the two sources. except for mir <dig>  which recorded a higher level in the pod compared with phloem , mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> showed much greater abundance in phloem exudate. the enrichments in exudate were 52-, 132- and 39-fold respectively.

pi deprivation in the rooting medium resulted in a significant increase in accumulation of mir <dig> in phloem exudate collected from the fruits of lupin plants .

discussion
source of macromolecules in phloem exudate
unambiguous analysis of the contents of the se is essential to establish which macromolecules are present in phloem and likely to be translocated. stylets of sap sucking insects provide the least damaging means for collecting se contents but to date detailed proteomic and transcriptomic analyses following stylectomy have been restricted to exudate collected from rice and barley  <cit> . an attempt using aphids with castor bean collected a very small amount of exudate and detailed analysis was not possible  <cit> . however, in a recent study aphid stylet exudate collected from apple stems was analysed and stem-loop rt pcr used to amplify small rnas, including mirnas  <cit> . thus collecting exudates from dicotyledonous species has relied largely on incisions made to the vasculature  <cit>  and, while their analysis has shown a broad range of proteins and transcripts, some of which have also been identified in stylet exudate  <cit> , the extent to which they are contaminants from cells surrounding the se is difficult to determine.

a recent analysis  <cit>  has found that exudate collected from a wound in pumpkin comprises solutes almost exclusively derived from extra fascicular phloem  and not the main fascicular phloem  system. thus the metabolite, protein and rna composition detected in exudate collected from cucurbit species is likely to be derived from se of the minor efp and not the major translocation stream . this distinction does not apply to exudates from lupin. there is no structural evidence for spatially distinct phloem systems  <cit>  and quantitative studies of c and n transport, based on assumptions of mass flow of solutes measured in exudates, account for the c and n economy of component organs in the species  <cit> .

recovery of either proteins or transcripts of rubisco has been used as a relative measure of contamination of phloem exudate and analysis of exudates collected from wounds to the vasculature shows the presence of both  <cit> . the major venation within the sutures of the lupin fruit is bounded by bundle sheath tissue rich in chloroplasts and phloem cc of the suture vasculature showed numerous profiles of intact plastids with limited internal membrane structure  <cit> . both these cell types would have been damaged by the incision, their contents contaminating the exudate even though the first drop of exudate that formed was excluded from collection and analysis. another study  <cit>  used rubisco as an indicator and concluded that the initial exudate from castor bean contained 12% due to contamination while the subsequent exudate contained only 2%. large  and small  subunits of rubisco  together with transcripts for the small subunit as well as a number of transcripts for structural components of the photosystems, including chlorophyll a/b binding proteins, were identified in lupin exudate . detailed tem studies of the pod vasculature in white lupin  <cit>  indicate a small number of profiles for p-type plastids in a parietal position in se, apparently attached to the plasma membrane, and it is possible that these contain some plastid proteins  <cit> . interestingly, the observed mass of rubisco small subunit in spot  <dig> , ca  <dig>  kda, is lower than the theoretical molecular weight of their closest match which is  <dig> kda for rubisco small subunit of phaseolus vulgaris protein and  <dig> kda for rubisco small subunit from glycine max. smaller rubisco proteins were also observed in exudate from brassica napus  <cit>  consistent with the polypeptide being non-functional, having been proteolytically trimmed or catabolised.

comparative analysis of transcripts in exudate and adjacent pod tissue  indicates that if in fact the transcripts were derived entirely from damaged non se cells at the wound then the levels of each relative to expression in the pod tissue should be similar. this is clearly not the case indicating that the exudate contained transcripts that were not simply a consequence of contamination. susy has been immunolocalised specifically to cc, of both loading and unloading phloem  <cit>  and cc were undoubtedly incised together with the se in lupin. a susy transcript in exudate from castor bean has been identified  <cit>  but in the cereals sampled by stylectomy neither the protein nor its transcript have been documented  <cit> . while proteomic analysis of lupin exudate did not identify susy, this protein has been found in pumpkin exudate  <cit>  and many years earlier susy activity in phloem exudate was demonstrated from a cucurbit  <cit> . the absolute values from the rt-qpcr assays showed that chlorophyll a/b binding protein transcript was the most abundant among the group analysed  but the protein was not detected in the proteomic analysis. like susy, the chlorophyll a/b binding protein transcript was also likely to be present in exudate largely, if not solely, as a result of contamination. using the relative level of the susy transcript the contribution of each of the other transcripts analysed from damaged non-se cells to the exudate was assessed to be  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 74% for ft, actin, rubisco, sam, ubiquitin, aquaporin and chlorophyll a/b binding protein respectively.

levels of four of the mirnas found in phloem exudate compared to adjacent pod tissue  also provide an estimate of the likely levels of contamination. the data indicated that contamination from the damaged non-se cells at the incision might account for a substantial proportion of mir <dig>  however, this could not have been the case for the other three mirnas tested, each of which was highly enriched in exudate compared to the surrounding tissue. a relatively low abundance of mir <dig> compared to mir <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> has also been reported in exudate from b. napus  <cit> . mir <dig> has been used previously as an indicator of the level of contamination as it has not been detected in other phloem exudates by northern analysis  <cit>  and was not amplified from stylet exudate in apple  <cit> . a strong hybridisation signal was obtained when the probe was bound to rna extracted from root tissue and a weaker signal observed when bound to rna from leaves but there was no detectable signal from phloem exudate .

taken together these data indicate that exudate collected from vascular incision in lupin is contributed mainly from se and that the level of contamination from surrounding damaged tissue is relatively low.

proteomic/transcriptomic analyses of exudate
the parallel proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of lupin phloem exudate have identified a vast array of proteins  and transcripts  in each case with a lesser group detected in both analyses . the fact that the transcript and the product of its translation occur together does not necessarily mean that translation has occurred in the se. enucleate se are not believed to be able to engage in transcription or protein synthesis and macromolecules in se are formed in phloem cc, traversing the cell interface through plasmodesmata. this belief has recently been challenged by a proteomic analysis of pumpkin phloem exudate  <cit>  in which proteins involved with rna binding and mrna translation were identified, and, on this basis, the authors suggested that some proteins in the phloem translocation stream are synthesized in the se system. experimental confirmation for this view is lacking and, significantly, another study was unable to show rna translation in pumpkin phloem exudate using an in vitro assay with brome mosaic virus rna  <cit> . while proteins involved in protein synthesis were not identified in the exudates from lupin, a small number of transcripts encoding proteins involved in protein synthesis were observed . the corresponding expressed proteins may have been among the many faintly staining spots that were not sampled from 2d gels and their identity awaits more detailed analysis of the lupin phloem proteome. if protein synthesis in se can be demonstrated, then long held assumptions about the source of macromolecules in phloem will have to be revised.

protein modification/ turnover
while the presence of protein degrading enzymes might be expected in se either in relation to protein turnover  <cit>  or in protecting the phloem against pathogen or insect attack, the presence of their transcripts would not be required unless they had some other role in se. perhaps some of these are part of the long distance signalling pathway with a range of as yet unknown functions. a large number of transcripts related to proteinase-inhibitor activity and the ubiquitin-ligase complex has also been found in phloem exudate collected from melon  <cit> .

proteins and transcripts with chaperone activity, such as cyclophilins , were identified together with a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase-like transcript in lupin exudate . cyclophilins, known to occur in se  <cit> , have also been suggested to play a role in signal processing during development  <cit>  and in protein phosphorylation  <cit> . it has been proposed that chaperone activity is involved in unfolding, cell-to-cell protein trafficking and refolding of polypeptides on the se side after import from cc via plasmodesmata  <cit> . cyclophilins are also required for mirna regulation of gene expression and specifically in the action of mir <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> . mir <dig> was a prominent species in lupin phloem exudate  and it is tempting to speculate that it might be translocated together with cyclophilin to some site of action. ubiquitin extension protein , ubiquitin conjugating enzyme-like protein  and ubiquitin protein ligase  have also been identified in lupin exudate. each of these could be involved in the transport of proteins synthesized in the cc to the se, playing a role in maintenance of the enucleate se.

spots  <dig> and  <dig>  were identified as a udp-glucose:protein transglucosylase. such activity could lead to post-translational modification in phloem and might account for the multiple spots on gels that were found for some of the identified proteins. it would be interesting to assess the degree to which glycosylated proteins occurred in these exudates. several pumpkin phloem exudate proteins appear to be post-translationally modified by phosphorylation and/or glycosylation and their modification seems to be required for the interaction of non-cell-autonomous phloem proteins with chaperones, enabling their movement through plasmodesmata  <cit> . protein kinases were present in rice exudate collected by stylectomy together with evidence for ca2+-dependant phosphorylation of proteins  <cit>  as well as in stylet exudate from barley  <cit> . while both protein kinases and calmodulin were among the transcripts in lupin exudate  their proteins were not recorded from the 2d-gel analysis. s-adenosylmethionine  synthase mrna  and protein , along with methionine synthase  were identified in this study. while there may be other fates for methionine and sam one possibility is in the provision of methyl groups for methylation reactions in se, possibly associated with post-translational modification of proteins.

cell structural components
actin  and profilin  proteins together with their mrna  have been identified in phloem exudate of lupin. both proteins have been recorded in phloem exudates from a number of monocotyledon and dicotyledon species  <cit>  and it has been demonstrated that both are constantly delivered into the se and are mobile in the translocation stream of castor bean  <cit> . in the latter profilin was present in a 15-fold molar excess compared to actin  <cit>  and this also appears to be the case in lupin . profilin is a potent regulator of actin polymerization and its elevated level within the translocation stream may prevent formation of microfilaments  <cit>  by inhibiting actin polymerization  <cit> . actin and actin-depolymerizing factors  appear to be part of the common proteins present in pumpkin, rice and brassica phloem exudates  <cit>  suggesting conservation of actin-dependant processes in phloem including those of legumes. whether or not there is a dynamic network of cytoskeletal elements that remodel cytoplasmic architecture in response to external and internal stimuli  <cit>  in the mature se remains to be determined.

redox regulation
the presence of a complete and functional antioxidant defence mechanism in the phloem has been suggested in a number of previous studies  <cit> . proteins involved in cell redox homeostasis, such as glutathione peroxidase , ascorbate peroxidase , monodehydroascorbate reductase  and dehydroascorbate reductase , were all identified in lupin exudate, consistent with the existence of an effective ascorbate-glutathione cycle in phloem. interestingly, the corresponding transcripts of these proteins were also present . synthesis of nitric oxide has been demonstrated in cc of vicia faba vascular bundles in vivo in response to salicylic acid and h2o <dig>  <cit> , each of these compounds has been linked in a response pathway to pathogen attack or other stress responses. thus a very complex relationship between such a pathway and antioxidant defense mechanisms involving glutathione , for example, must exist in the vasculature as a general reaction to sudden stress and pathogen attack. the gsh levels in cucurbit exudates were as high as  <dig> mm  <cit>  together with significant rates of gsh reductase activity. proteins involved in cell redox homeostasis may also play a role in phloem protein stability under prolonged stress and in maintenance of se integrity by removing ros over the long life of the se/cc complex  <cit> .

thioredoxin  h was identified  together with a partial transcript in lupin exudate . importantly, trx mrna has been identified in phloem exudate collected from rice by stylectomy  <cit>  and a role in phloem protein stability under stress and in maintenance of se has been attributed to this group of proteins  <cit> . a  <dig> kda cytosolic h-type trx moved from cc to adjacent se in rice  <cit>  and in arabidopsis trx h <dig> is associated with the plasma membrane and shows intercellular mobility  <cit> . interestingly this last study also found that this particular trx was reduced by gsh rather than nadp-trx reductase and a loss of function mutant for the gene was severely reduced in growth and development  <cit> . it was postulated that the cell-to-cell communication by trx in this case relayed redox information  <cit>  and it is conceivable that a similar role might be important in maintenance of the se. the implications of the presence of trx transcript in exudate remain to be elucidated. however, arabidopsis mutants with lesions in an m-type trx showed increased callose accumulation and reduced plasmodesmatal permeability  <cit> . whether or not trxs generally are involved in redox regulation of callose deposition and other phloem biochemistry remains to be assessed. however, it has been shown, through integrated biochemical and genetic assays, that the nadph-dependent trx system was an effective backup for gsh reductase in arabidopsis  <cit> .

glutathione s-transferase   was also present in lupin exudate. this enzyme catalyses a reaction between the thiol group of cysteine in the tripeptide to form a conjugate with xenobiotic molecules  rendering them inactive/non-toxic. perhaps gst functions to conjugate and translocate xenobiotics or endogenous toxins that enter the se/cc complex. it should be noted that while glutathione is potentially important for these various 'protection' functions it is also a significant form of translocated s in plants  <cit>  and is believed to be the long distance signal in phloem that regulates sulphate ion uptake in roots  <cit> .

stress and defence response
in addition to the group of proteins associated with redox regulation a related category of proteins and transcripts also involved in responses to stress and in defence against pathogens and insect attack were identified in lupin exudate. these included pathogenesis related proteins , metallothionens and proteins involved in ethylene synthesis.

identification of a prp  in the phloem of lupin suggests an active, localised, defence reaction mechanism. it is not clear whether the presence of this protein is constitutive or whether it indicates that the plants from which phloem exudate was collected were responding to a pathogen attack. although phloem exudate was collected from field-grown plants that appeared healthy, the possibility that pathogens had infected the plants without producing visible symptoms cannot be excluded. in this regard, it may be significant that  <dig> transcripts, comprising 3% of characterised ests, were identified in lupin exudate as those for bean yellow mosaic virus polyprotein. this pathogen is a common disease of lupins in western australia and is transmitted by aphids  <cit> . phloem from celery petioles has been dissected and mrna compared from plants with and without feeding aphids  <cit> . transcripts for  <dig> genes increased in plants with aphids and these included transcripts involved in stress responses . given that the lupin plants used in this study were exposed to virus infection and probably also aphids it is not surprising that many of the aphid-enhanced transcripts identified previously  <cit>  were also found in the exudate from lupin.

spots  <dig> and  <dig>  were quite prominent and were identified as isoflavone reductase and pterocarpan  reductase respectively. these two proteins are nadp-linked oxidoreductases involved in the synthesis of isoflavonoid phytoalexins in legumes  <cit> . phytoalexins are also likely to be part of the plant's defences against microbial and herbivore attack but whether or not these defence molecules are present in and translocated by phloem is not known. isoflavone reductase mrna was also identified in lupin exudate .

metabolism
proteins and transcripts in this category comprised a diverse range involved in carbohydrate  metabolism, the synthesis and breakdown of organic acids, amino acids and other n-containing substrates, fatty acid and secondary metabolite synthesis and in atp/adenylate metabolism as well as a host of transferase enzymes. phloem exudate collected from castor bean contained a full complement of glycolytic intermediates  <cit>  and in a number of proteomic analyses of exudates glycolysis pathway proteins have been identified. these data have led to the generalisation that cytosol-localised glycolysis may be involved with carbohydrate metabolism in se/cc complexes to produce atp for phloem loading and glucose for callose formation  <cit> . however, some glycolytic enzymes may be multifunctional proteins involved in processes other than carbohydrate metabolism  <cit> . in lupin exudate, proteins involved in glycolysis included fructose-bisphosphate aldolase , enolase , glyceraldehyde-3p dehydrogenase , triosephosphate isomerase  and fructokinase . nevertheless, a complete glycolytic pathway was not found and this was also the case for rice phloem collected by stylectomy  <cit> . interestingly, the mrna of many of these proteins was also identified in lupin exudate .

the ses in lupin pod suture vasculature show a number of mitochondria with limited cristal structure  <cit>  but the only protein of the kreb's cycle identified in exudate was malate dehydrogenase  together with its transcript . while other components of a respiratory pathway may have been present but not detectable on 2d gels the data suggest that mitochondria in se may not function in atp-generation. a number of other proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism were detected in lupin exudate including mannose 6p reductase , udp-d-glucuronate carboxy-lyase  and, as noted above, a udp-glucose:protein transglucosylase. other enzymes of glucuronate metabolism were not identified but it could be significant that d-glucuronate is a precursor for ascorbate synthesis, another potential metabolite for pathways of redox regulation.

signalling
the question of long distance signalling in plants together with a functional role for phloem has long exercised the minds of plant physiologists. there seems little doubt that the common plant growth regulators  are phloem mobile but even in these cases the connection between their presence in exudates, translocation and mode of action at a 'sink' is not well established. identification of proteins in phloem exudates has highlighted a possible role for the vasculature in synthesizing some phytohormones in situ  <cit> , including jasmonic acid  and ethylene. there is also recent evidence for localization of expression of one of the isopentenyl pyrophosphate transferase alleles  in phloem, consistent with localized ck synthesis  <cit> . as noted above, s-adenosylmethionine  synthase mrna and protein along with methionine synthase were identified in lupin exudate. one fate for sam is synthesis of ethylene from methionine through the intermediates sam and aminocyclopropane-carboxylate   <cit> . activities of acc synthase and acc oxidase would also be required for in situ production of ethylene in se and neither was detected in lupin exudate. acc oxidase is common to almost all plant tissues and perhaps it was among the spots that could not be identified or were not sequenced. a further metabolic fate for sam is in the biosynthesis of polyamines, but there was no evidence for proteins associated with these reactions in lupin exudate.

one of the prominent spots identified on gels of lupin exudate contained a protein that showed high homology to flowering locus t-like  <dig> protein  from chenopodium rubrum . because lupin exudate was collected from developing fruits on plants where flowers were still being fertilized on secondary and tertiary inflorescences, the presence of ft in phloem is not unexpected. these results are consistent with the reported presence of ft proteins in exudate collected from brassica napus  <cit> , cucurbita. maxima  <cit>  and, significantly, by stylectomy from rice  <cit> . ft proteins and their orthologs act as non-cell-autonomous signals that regulate flowering in arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and cucurbits  <cit> . ft transcript was not detected using real-time rt-pcr with exudate collected from flowering pumpkin  <cit>  or rice  <cit>  but was identified in  and readily amplified from lupin exudate . whether or not ft transcripts or proteins constitute the elusive 'florigen' their presence in phloem exudates from diverse sources, including legumes, lend further support to the idea that each or both are indeed long distance signals.

it has been suggested that certain signals might be transduced by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions in the se of rice plants  <cit> . as noted above several proteins in rice phloem exudate, collected by stylectomy, were phosphorylated in vivo  <cit> . inhibition of protein phosphorylation by a protein kinase inhibitor in vitro was consistent with protein kinases existing in the phloem sap of rice plants in a soluble form  <cit> . no protein kinase proteins were identified in lupin phloem exudate but a small group of transcripts encoding protein kinases and calmodulin was recorded .

in addition to acting at their site of synthesis and entry into the phloem system, proteins within the se may themselves play a role in long-distance signalling  <cit> . while questions about the likely origin of all proteins and transcripts in exudates remain, it is most critical for those for which signalling roles have been postulated. to a degree one critical piece of evidence, yet to be gathered is that either the protein or its transcript is found in exudate collected from insect stylets as well as from incisions to the vasculature.

nucleic acid binding
rna binding proteins have been characterised in phloem exudates  <cit> . two of the more prominent spots  on gels of lupin exudate were identified as containing a glycine-rich rna-binding protein . other proteomic analyses of exudates have identified these proteins  <cit> . it has been suggested that some members of this family may be involved in stress responses, as their mrna levels change following exposure to cold, wounding, hormone treatments and water stress in both plants and animals  <cit> . however, the physiological function of these proteins is still not clear. expression of ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  two members of a class of arabidopsis grps, was influenced by cold treatment and circadian rhythm  <cit>  and it was hypothesized that ccr <dig> could stabilize mrna species during conditions of cold and in response to other environmental stresses  <cit> . other possible functions of these types of protein include pre-mrna processing, mrna translation and stability, mrna repression and/or protein turnover  <cit> . although it is quite tempting to speculate that grps could form ribonucleotide complexes and translocate rna, as has been reported for some other rna binding proteins, to date there are no reports of rna translocation properties attributed to this group of proteins. grps also appear to have a role in floral transition in arabidopsis, specifically in regulation of flowering time  <cit> . the loss of function mutant, atgrp <dig>  exhibits a delay in the transition to flowering, whereas the gain of function through ectopic over-expression of atgrp <dig> promotes flowering  <cit> . some ribosomal proteins and proteins associated with translation also display rna-binding capacity. the protein and rna components of a phloem mobile rna binding protein  complex in pumpkin have been identified and characterised  <cit> . interestingly, one of the phloem transcripts identified as part of the complex was an ethylene response factor also identified in lupin exudate .

micrornas in exudate
following the initial identification of mirnas in phloem exudate from cucurbits  <cit>  and white lupin  <cit> , a number of studies have suggested that these small rna species might be phloem-mobile and may have a long-distance signalling role  <cit> . systemic signalling could reasonably be expected to be involved in a range of 'source-sink relationships' whether these relate to the partitioning of assimilates, nutrient allocation or in the coordination of development processes, defence or responses to abiotic stress . a recent compilation identified  <dig> mirnas involved in plant responses to drought/salt stress  <cit> . eight of these were identified in lupin phloem exudate  and, importantly, six have been amplified from apple stylet exudate  <cit> .

a unique feature of legumes is their capacity to fix atmospheric n in root nodules and a number of mirnas have been linked to early stages of nodulation and the subsequent development of mature functional nodules  <cit> . these include mirnas associated with hormone responses and include mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  all of which have been found in lupin phloem exudate collected from the downward moving translocation stream . nodules are a significant phloem 'sink' for nutrients and especially sugars and it is not unreasonable to expect that this may also apply to macromolecules in phloem. whether the mirnas that accumulate differentially in nodules as they develop are due in part to translocation remains to be determined.

among the  <dig> mirnas analysed by northern blot in lupin tissues some were prominent in phloem exudate while others were either absent or much lower than in the other tissues studied  suggesting that there is a specific spectrum of mirnas in lupin phloem as seen in brassica napus  <cit> . furthermore, this spectrum differed at different sites on the plant where exudate was collected . the most reasonable explanation for the presence of mirnas in phloem is that they are transported from the adjacent cc. thus, the fact that the pattern for five mirnas in exudate collected at three different sites  was not the same suggests either their differential expression in cc at different sites and/or specificity in phloem loading. interestingly, another study made parallel analyses of mirnas in stylet exudate and phloem tissue extracts and found that while seven mirnas were common four that were amplified from the tissue were not detected in exudate lending further support to the idea that transfer to the se is specific  <cit> . if mirnas serve as translocated signals it is not too surprising that the downward-moving  and upward-moving phloem streams  showed differences in mirna composition. as noted above, lupins offer the possibility of sampling exudate from phloem translocating from 'source' organs of the shoot, including leaflet midribs and petioles, to 'sinks' such as fruits and apices as well as to those of the root system separately  <cit> . it would be interesting to further exploit this ability by extending the range of mirnas assayed to include the many more that have now been identified in exudates  <cit> .

the question of contamination due to the mode of phloem sampling in lupin, as discussed above for proteins and gene transcripts, applies equally to mirnas. the data gathered here for four mirnas in exudate versus the surrounding pod tissue  clearly indicates that three of those assayed were highly enriched in exudate. although the extent to which exudate might be contaminated cannot be easily estimated it seems likely that mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> are normal constituents of phloem in lupin while mir <dig> is not. mir <dig> was the most abundant cloned mirna from b.napus phloem exudate  <cit> .

the most compelling case for translocation of mirnas is that of mir <dig> which increases sharply in both leaf tissue and phloem exudate in response to pi starvation  <cit> . a similar response of mir <dig> to pi withdrawal was demonstrated here for lupin  and significantly the most abundant source was the downward moving phloem stream . recent data has revealed at least four additional mirnas and several mirna*s with strong p status-dependent expression in arabidopsis  <cit>  and some of these also show enhanced levels in b. napus phloem exudate with pi limitation. the levels of mir169m in exudate from b.napus are decreased in response to decreased n supply  <cit>  and in lupin this mirna was prominent in exudate  especially in that collected from newly formed axillary shoots . it will be interesting to examine the status of mir <dig>  mir <dig> and other mirnas associated with nutrient homeostasis in translocation streams collected at different sites of lupin under a range of nutrient limitations.

a transcript encoding argonaute <dig>  protein, thought to be involved in rna silencing  <cit> , was also identified in this study . the transcript has not been described for other phloem exudates and it is tempting to speculate that it is translocated in phloem to be translated in other parts of the plant where it acts in rna silencing.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study provide the first set of analyses for macromolecules in phloem exudate from a legume. it is reassuring that many of the proteins and transcripts have also been documented in exudates collected from a number of cucurbits  <cit> , castor bean  <cit> , rapeseed  <cit> , and rice  <cit> . indeed many of the proteins in the 'phloem exudate proteome' derived by comparison among species  <cit>  are conserved in the phloem proteome of lupin. similarly mirnas in phloem exudate appear also to be conserved across species though undoubtedly there are many more small rnas to discover and document in relation to phloem and translocation. while the inventory of macromolecules is a useful starting point, questions about the origin of each in exudate and which are mobile in phloem remain. a critical deficiency is the need for detailed comparative macromolecule analyses of exudate collected by stylectomy from the range of species, including lupin, that have been to date sampled by incisions to the vasculature. the functional significance of each of the proteins, transcripts and small rnas in phloem also poses new questions about the biochemical features and maintenance of se. there appears to be specific metabolic components that might also function to support the se and a wide range of proteins that appear to be involved in 'defence' . how these relate specifically to either phloem function or systemic signalling is yet to be determined.
