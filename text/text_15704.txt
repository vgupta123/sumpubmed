BACKGROUND
streptococcus pyogenes causes heterogeneous disease types, including pharyngitis, cellulitis, and bacteremia  <cit> . the pathogenesis of s. pyogenes infection involves an intriguing host-pathogen interplay in which the biological activity of several bacterial virulence products are modulated by host factors  <cit> . the details of the molecular interaction between the bacterium and the host, as well as their influences on the prognosis and severity of streptococcal infection, remain poorly understood. s. pyogenes has been reported to produce a number of surface-associated and extracellular products contributing to the pathogenesis. in particular, several cell surface proteins have been documented as being involved in adherence and colonization during infection  <cit> .

many cell surface proteins of gram-positive bacteria share similar structural characteristics that include a variable amino terminus, a central region with repeated sequences, and a cell-associated region with a lpxtgx cell wall anchored motif  <cit> . a new s. pyogenes cell surface protein family, streptococcal collagen-like  protein, has been identified recently  <cit> . scl <dig>  and scl <dig> , two scl protein family members, share a similar structure motif, including the lpxtgx motif and a central region composed of variable numbers of gly-x-x  collagen-like motifs. collagen exhibits a triple-helical, elongated protein structure that is the structural component of the extracellular matrix in multicellular organisms. as eukaryotic cells are known to bind to collagen through receptors expressed on cell surfaces  <cit> , it is reasonable to speculate that the scl protein family may participate in the colonization/binding of s. pyogenes to receptors on the host cell. although the potential role of scl <dig> in adhesion has been demonstrated by disrupting the scl <dig> gene in different s. pyogenes strains  <cit> , the conclusions may be affected by the use of different s. pyogenes strains and their carriages of various adhesins. in addition, the presence of other scl family proteins, as well as other streptococcal surface proteins, which may mask the potential role of scl <dig> in adhesion, was not taken into consideration in these studies.

recent studies have demonstrated that collagen receptor, α2β <dig> and α11β <dig> integrins  <cit> , low density lipoprotein  <cit> , thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor  <cit> , cellular fibronectin and laminin  <cit>  and human complement regulatory plasma glycoprotein fh  <cit>  may serve as ligands for scl proteins. while the scl <dig> gene has been found in all s. pyogenes isolates tested, the scl <dig> gene sequence was only detected in some strains  <cit> . to determine the bona fide nature of scl <dig> in colonization and adherence of s. pyogenes to human epithelial cells without the potential interference of other streptococcal surface factors, we generated a scl <dig> mutant from a scl2-defective s. pyogenes m <dig> strain, and expressed scl <dig> in the heterologous bacteria escherichia coli. the adhesion to human epithelial cells was greatly impaired upon the loss of scl <dig> in s. pyogenes and was markedly increased upon expression of scl <dig> on e. coli.

RESULTS
identification and analysis of scl <dig> and scl <dig> genes in s. pyogenes m <dig> strain
to identify genes encoding streptococcal collagen-like surface protein  <dig> and  <dig>  in s. pyogenes m <dig> strain, full lengths of scl <dig> and scl <dig> genes were amplified by pcr and sequenced. the scl <dig> orf of s. pyogenes m <dig> is  <dig>  bp, which encodes a protein with  <dig> amino acid residues . the ala <dig> was the predicted signal peptidase cleavage site. the length of variable  region is  <dig> amino acids. the collagen-like  region is composed of  <dig> gxx triplet repeats, followed by a gram-positive bacteria cell wall anchor motif  in the cell wall membrane  region. the cl region and cell wall anchor motif are connected by  <dig> repeats with a pgekapeks core sequence in the linker  region.

it has been shown that the expression of scl <dig> is controlled by slipped-strand mispairing at sites containing pentanucleotide coding repeats  <cit> . in this study, s. pyogenes m <dig> strain contained the scl <dig> gene, which is predicted to be translated from a putative gtg  start codon . we identified  <dig> aacaa pentanucleotide sequence repeats adjacent to the presumed gtg start codon in s. pyogenes m <dig>  followed by a premature translation termination at the 89th amino acid residue upon production of scl <dig> protein . however, the prematurely translated scl <dig> protein contains neither cl region nor the anchor motif, suggesting it is not functional and not anchored on the bacteria. these observations show that the s. pyogenes m <dig> strain appears to express scl <dig> protein consisting of  <dig> gxx triplet repeats and premature non-functional scl <dig> protein.

loss of adherence to human epithelial cells in s. pyogenes mutant deficient in both scl <dig> and scl2
to determine the role of scl <dig> in the adherence of s. pyogenes to human epithelial cells in the absence of scl <dig>  we generated a scl <dig> mutant from the scl2-defective s. pyogenes m <dig> strain. a kanamycin-resistant mutant  was identified after electroporation of s. pyogenes m <dig> with the non-replicating plasmid ppjt <dig>  which contains the internal fragment of the scl <dig> coding region. pcr and southern blot analysis confirmed the site of mutation, and indicated that the integration occurred through a campbell-like mechanism . no difference in growth rates between the mutant and wild-type strains in tsby was identified , suggesting that the disruption of scl <dig> did not affect major metabolic pathways under a nutrient-enriched condition, and the integration of ppjt <dig> did not affect the neighboring genes of scl <dig>  to further clarify if the mutagenesis strategy affected other surface factors, we determined the expression of fibronectin binding proteins, sfb and prtf <dig>  and another known adhesin, oppa, as well as an exotoxin speb as the internal control . expression of these four genes was not affected in the scl <dig> mutant st <dig>  these results suggest that the mutagenesis strategy did not influence other surface factors, and the scl <dig> mutant has not compensated for the loss of this adhesin by altering expression profiles for other potential surface binding proteins we tested. in addition, dna sequence and the number of pentanucleotide repeats of scl <dig> were not altered in st <dig> .

to further investigate the role of scl <dig> in mediating the adherence of s. pyogenes to human epithelial cells, wild-type and scl1-mutated s. pyogenes st <dig>  in the exponential phase, were examined for adhesion to human hep- <dig> epithelial cells. adhesion of st <dig>  was decreased about 70% compared with that of the wild-type , suggesting that scl <dig> is critical in the adherence of s. pyogenes to human epithelial cells.

ectopic expression of scl <dig> on e. coli
to exclude the interference of other streptococcal surface factors during the adhesion, and to test whether scl <dig> is sufficient to mediate the adherence to human epithelium cells, we expressed scl <dig> on the heterologous bacteria e. coli. signal sequence , wm region, and part of the l region of scl <dig> were not constructed into ompa-containing vector. e. coli dh5α with ompa-containing vector was represented as et <dig>  whereas e. coli dh5α with truncated scl1-ompa construct was represented as et <dig>  to confirm the expression of scl <dig> protein on the surface of e. coli, we performed facs analysis on whole bacteria. a right-shift of peak fluorescence recognized by anti-scl <dig> antibodies was observed in et <dig>  but not in either e. coli dh5α or et <dig>  . consistent with this observation, the negative staining of electron microscopy revealed hairy structures in et <dig>  but these structures were not identified in either e. coli dh5α or et <dig> . to further demonstrate that scl <dig> was ectopically expressed on e. coli, outer membrane fraction of proteins was isolated from et <dig> and et <dig>  western blot analysis with anti-scl <dig> antibodies identified scl <dig> in the outer membrane fraction of et <dig> but not in that of et <dig> . consistently, a molecular weight shift was revealed by anti-ompa antibodies in the outer membrane fraction of et <dig> . thus, our data confirmed that scl <dig> protein was ectopically expressed on e. coli and can be detected by anti-scl <dig> antibodies.

adherence of scl1-expressed e. coli to human epithelial cells
adhesion analysis demonstrated that scl1-expressed e. coli et <dig> dramatically increased its adherence to hep- <dig>  compared with that of vector-expressed e. coli et <dig> and e. coli dh5α . pre-incubation of e. coli et <dig> with proteinase k significantly attenuated the scl1-mediated increase in adhesion, suggesting that scl <dig> proteins on e. coli are critical for this binding. thus, the addition of scl <dig> on the surface of the heterologous bacteria greatly enhances their adherence to human epithelial cells.

to directly address the role of scl <dig> in the binding process, we performed competition studies using anti-scl <dig> antibodies and recombinant scl <dig>  protein. polyclonal anti-scl <dig> antibodies were generated in 4-week-old balb/c mice. the full-length rscl <dig> protein containing sequences shown in figure 1a was generated and confirmed by sds-page as a single band of approximately  <dig> kda  and by western blot analysis with anti-scl <dig> antibodies . both pre-incubation of hep- <dig> cells with rscl <dig> and pre-incubation of et <dig> bacteria with anti-scl <dig> antibodies significantly blocked the adherence of e. coli et <dig> to human epithelial cells . the adherence of e. coli et <dig> to hep- <dig> cells was not affected by pre-incubation of et <dig> bacteria with non-specific mouse igg. these results reveal both the importance and sufficiency of scl <dig> in mediating the adherence of bacteria to human epithelial cells.

adherence through protein receptor on epithelial cells
our previous data showed that the adhesion was affected when scl1-expressed e. coli was pre-incubated with proteinase k, suggesting that the adhesion is mediated through a protein-like molecule on the bacteria. to further determine the corresponding side of surface molecules on epithelial cells mediating this binding process, hep- <dig> cells were treated with pronase and phospholipase a <dig> to modify the protein and lipid contents on the cell membrane, respectively  <cit> . treatment of pronase significantly inhibited the binding of et <dig> to epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner . in contrast, treatment of phospholipase a <dig> did not affect the binding of et <dig> to epithelial cells . these results suggest that a protein receptor for scl <dig> on epithelial cells is likely to mediate this binding event.

it has been proposed that α2β <dig> and α11β <dig> integrins might serve as receptors in mediating the scl <dig> adherence to epithelial cells  <cit> . to determine the role of integrins in the scl1-mediated binding process, we used monoclonal antibodies against α <dig>  β <dig>  and α2β <dig> integrins, and performed a competition assay. pretreatment of monoclonal antibodies against α <dig>  β <dig>  and α2β <dig> integrins to hep- <dig> cells did not affect scl1-mediated increase in the adhesion of e. coli to human epithelial cells . however, we observed a trend, although not significant, toward reduction in the adhesion of e. coli to hep- <dig> cells in the presence of monoclonal α2β <dig> antibodies, suggesting that α2β <dig> integrin is involved to some extent in the scl1-mediated binding process. to avoid the lack of interference of the abovementioned monoclonal antibodies in the binding interaction, we employed polyclonal antibodies against α <dig> and β <dig> integrins. polyclonal antibodies against α <dig> and β <dig> integrins significantly decreased scl1-mediated adhesion of e. coli to human epithelial cells . these results suggest that protein receptors α <dig> and β <dig> integrins underlie the scl1-dependent binding to human epithelial cells.

to further examine the scl1-mediated adhesion of e. coli to other eukaryotic cell types known for expression of collagen receptors, we employed two types of cell lines, c2c <dig> myoblast and human umbilical vein endothelial cell  for the adhesion assay. c2c <dig> cells are known to express β <dig> integrins  <cit> , whereas primary huvecs express α2β <dig> integrins  <cit> . our results show that scl1-expressed e. coli et <dig> exhibited significantly increased adherence to both c2c <dig> and huvec cells, compared to control et <dig> . thus multiple eukaryotic cell types may bind and adhere to scl1-expressed e. coli.

discussion
the scl <dig> protein in the s. pyogenes m <dig> strain  contains a predicted signal peptidase cleavage site on ala <dig>   <dig> amino acids in v region,  <dig> gxx repeats in cl region,  <dig> conserved repeats  in l region, and followed by a cell wall anchor motif . it has been proposed that the v-region primary sequence in scl <dig> is m type associated  <cit> . based on the previous study in characterization of the scl <dig> gene among  <dig> different m type strains  <cit> , the length of v region in m <dig> strain is identical to those in m <dig> and m <dig> strains. the number of gxx repeats in cl region in m <dig> strain is equal to those in m <dig> and m <dig> strains. the number of pgekapeks repeats in l region in m <dig> strain is the same with those in m <dig> and m <dig> strains. these findings demonstrate significant and extensive genetic variations among clinical isolates of s. pyogenes.

rasmussen et al. demonstrated that an isogenic scl1-deficient m <dig> strain  with  <dig> gxx repeats did not alter its adhesion ability to detroit  <dig> pharyngeal cells  <cit> . in contrast, lukomski et al. demonstrated that two independent isogenic scl1-deficient m <dig> strains  with  <dig> gxx repeats had significantly reduced adherence to human a <dig> epithelial cells  <cit> . although the differences on the surface of various host epithelial cells cannot be excluded, this inconsistency may stem from the carriage of various group a streptococcal adhesins and potential interference of another scl family member, scl <dig>  the role of scl <dig> in adhesion has been directly addressed in another study by rasmussen et al. showing that scl2-deficient isogenic mutants had decreased adherence to human fibroblast cells, but no influence on adherence to pharyngeal cells  <cit> . thus, scl <dig> appears to be involved in the adhesion process, and the presence of scl <dig> could therefore potentially influence and mask the effect of scl <dig> in the adhesion. however, scl <dig> production in all m1-type strains investigated so far is early terminated at the level of translation  <cit> . in our study, we also demonstrated that the s. pyogenes m <dig> strain expresses a pre-terminated scl <dig>  which contains neither cl region nor anchor motif, according to our sequence analysis. these findings suggest that scl <dig> in this particular strain is not functional due to the absence of cl region, and is not anchored on the cell membrane because of the lack of an anchor motif. our adherence results based on this scl2-defective s. pyogenes m <dig> strain provide evidence for the contribution of scl <dig> on the binding to host epithelial cells.

while rasmussen et al. used a scl2-defective ap <dig> strain to demonstrate that scl <dig> mutation does not affect adherence of bacteria to pharyngeal cells  <cit> , their study may have utilized a background where the scl <dig> mutation was compensated for by other adhesins, such as protein h  <cit> , c5a peptidase  <cit> . in our study, we also identified the expression of some surface proteins in this m <dig> strain. to exclude the interference of other streptococcal surface factors during scl1-mediated adhesion, the heterologous expression of scl <dig> on e. coli would be an alternative. the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria presents an effective barrier that restricts the release of proteins from the bacteria  <cit> . many peptides have been inserted within external loops of various outer membrane proteins and have been shown to be exposed on the surface of intact e. coli by immunochemical techniques  <cit> . in addition, studies have demonstrated that ompa chimeric proteins were stably anchored on the external side of the bacteria  <cit> . here we demonstrated that truncated scl <dig> fused with ompa was directed to the outer membrane fraction of e. coli by western blot analysis, and likely exposed on the surface of e. coli by facs analysis. while ectopic expression of scl <dig> on the heterologous bacteria e. coli is an alternative approach to reduce the potential interference of other factors on the surface of s. pyogenes, there are some limitations in our study. for example, it can not be ruled out that scl <dig> protein was secreted to the periplasmic space, because scl <dig> was constructed after the ompa signal sequence. to avoid this problem, we performed facs analysis on whole bacteria using scl <dig> antibodies to detect the location of scl <dig> in/on e. coli. facs analysis has been widely used in identification of cell surface molecules in many immunologic and hematologic studies. furthermore, we isolated proteins from the outer membrane fraction and confirmed the existence of scl <dig> by western blot analysis with antibodies against scl <dig> and its fusion protein ompa. however, the proper folding of ectopically expressed scl <dig> and the integrity of the outer membrane of e. coli account for other issues influencing our interpretation of scl <dig> in adhesion. nevertheless, our findings concerning the adherence of scl1-expressed e. coli to human epithelial cells unequivocally show that scl <dig> contributes significantly to the adhesion of bacteria to human epithelial cells.

collagen is a triple-helical, elongated protein structure that is the main structural component of the extra-cellular matrix in all multicellular organisms. collagen-like sequences are found not only in proteins of multicellular organisms but also in proteins of microorganisms, such as a pullulanase in klebsiella pneuminiae  <cit>  and a platelet aggregation-associated protein in s. sanguis  <cit> . moreover, collagens interact with several macromolecules in a specific manner, suggesting that the collagen-like repeat sequences not only play a basic structural role, but also have a functional significance. many eukaryotic cells bind collagen through integrins expressed on their surface  <cit> . studies have demonstrated that the recombinant scl <dig>  protein interacted with α2β <dig> and α11β <dig> integrins, induced intracellular signaling in host cells, and promoted the internalization of s. pyogenes  <cit> . while the hypothesized region mediating the binding to α2β <dig> and α11β <dig> integrins in the recombinant scl <dig>  is in a motif called the glpger motif  <cit> , scl <dig> protein of s. pyogenes m <dig> strain in our study does not contain the glpger motif. the novel aspect of this study is the observation that, in this scl <dig> sequence type, the glpger motif is absent, yet adherence is maintained. nevertheless, our results indicate that protein receptors, α <dig> and β <dig> integrins, contribute to scl1-dependent binding to the surface of human epithelial cells. consistently, scl1-mediated adhesion was also demonstrated in other eukaryotic cell types known for expression of collagen receptors.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we demonstrated that loss of scl <dig> in a scl2-defective s. pyogenes strain decreased the adhesion of bacteria to human epithelial cells. ectopic expression of scl <dig> in the heterologous gram-negative bacteria e. coli promoted the adhesion of bacteria to epithelial cells. the increase in adhesion was nullified by proteinase k, rscl <dig> protein and anti-scl <dig> antibody. this binding event appears to be mediated through protein receptors, α <dig> and β <dig> integrins, instead of a lipid component, on the surface of epithelial cells. our results underscore the importance of scl <dig> in the adherence of s. pyogenes to human epithelial cells. understanding the mechanisms by which s. pyogenes adheres to nasal epithelial cells may lead to alternative therapeutic methods of decolonization and decrease the dependence on antibiotics.
