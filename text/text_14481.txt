BACKGROUND
dioxin-like chemicals are exceptionally toxic to a wide variety of birds, fish and mammals including, perhaps, humans. however, susceptibility to dioxin toxicity varies widely among different animal species and between genetic types within a species. extensive evidence demonstrates that virtually all toxic effects of tcdd and related dioxin-like compounds are mediated by a ligand-dependent transcription factor, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor  . exposure to dioxins results in major toxicities, including thymic atrophy, teratogenesis, hepatotoxicity, wasting syndrome and death. these toxicities are dependent on both the ahr and its dimerization partner, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator , and require that the ahr have functional structures for nuclear translocation and dna binding  <cit> .

dioxin binding converts the ahr into an activated ligand:ahr:arnt complex that regulates transcription either by binding directly to ahre-i motifs   <cit>  or indirectly to ahre-ii motifs  <cit> . dioxin toxicities appear to arise from ahr-mediated dysregulation of specific genes  <cit> . microarray technologies have accelerated identification of genes that depend on the ahr for constitutive expression or for response to tcdd in vivo  <cit> , but the key genes whose dysregulation by dioxin leads to most toxicities remain unknown.

the han/wistar  rat is an excellent model organism to identify specific ahr-regulated genes whose dysregulation by dioxin may lead to major toxicities. h/w rats are extraordinarily resistant to acute lethality from tcdd, with an ld <dig> three orders of magnitude higher than for sensitive long-evans rats   <cit> . resistance in h/w rats is associated with a point mutation that leads to expression of an aberrant ahr protein missing  <dig> or  <dig> amino acids from its transactivation domain   <cit> . we recently demonstrated, using transgenic mouse models, that it is the ahr variant with  <dig> amino acids deleted that is responsible for dioxin resistance  <cit> . importantly, this ahr variant is the predominantly-expressed form in the dioxin-resistant h/w rat  <cit> . further, dioxin resistance in rats segregates genetically with the ahr locus and is a dominant trait  <cit> . multi-generational crosses of l-e and h/w rats and selection for susceptibility or resistance to dioxin lethality  <cit>  produced two rat lines: line-a  and line-c . lna rats harbour the variant ahr and are dioxin-resistant; lnc rats have the wildtype ahr and are dioxin-sensitive. we postulate that the partial deletion of ahr transactivation domain alters toxic responses either by preventing changes in mrna levels of genes in pro-death pathways or by enhancing responses of genes in pro-survival pathways.

our strategy for identifying pro-survival or pro-death genes is to contrast changes in mrna expression profiles following tcdd exposure of dioxin-sensitive and dioxin-resistant rats  <cit> . to reduce the influence of strain-specific changes not associated with dioxin toxicities, we profiled  <dig> strains/lines of rats: h/w and lna which constitute the "resistant collective" and l-e and lnc which constitute the "sensitive collective".

we focused on hepatic mrna levels because liver displays a broad spectrum of mrnas that are responsive to dioxins and/or to ahr genotype  <cit>  and because liver is a prime site of dioxin toxicity, displaying many phenotypic differences between sensitive and resistant rats  <cit> . we chose a dose of  <dig> Î¼g/kg tcdd, which produces hepatotoxicity, wasting and death in sensitive rats but no deaths in resistant rats. we previously conducted a smaller-scale transcriptomic study in sensitive versus resistant rats on membrane arrays and using cross-species hybridization to cdna arrays  <cit> . here, we greatly extend those prior studies by assessing transcriptome-wide responses to tcdd which were further validated via real-time rt-pcr. we identify specific biological processes perturbed by tcdd exposure.

our analysis paints a new picture of dioxin-induced expression changes. hundreds of genes exhibit responses to tcdd that are specific to individual strains or lines. our genetic model diminishes this background noise and identifies a small number of genes associated with hepatotoxicity, wasting and death. genes differentially-expressed between sensitive and resistant strains show functional homogeneity: dioxin-lethality may be associated with broad dysregulation of entire pathways, not just single genes.

RESULTS
to determine the effect of tcdd on mrna abundances in dioxin-sensitive rats versus dioxin-resistant rats we studied four rat strains/lines at  <dig> hours after oral administration of tcdd  using affymetrix rae230a microarrays. a list of all genes and their responses to tcdd in the four rat strains/lines is given in additional file  <dig> 

global differences in mrna abundance
the total number of genes affected by tcdd varied across rat strains/lines in a manner independent of the statistical threshold . more genes were affected by tcdd in dioxin-sensitive rats than in dioxin-resistant rats: across all four strains/lines, the order of the number of transcriptional alterations was: l-e > lnc > lna > h/w. overall, it appears that the deletion in the ahr transactivation domain reduces the number of genes altered but does not ablate the transcriptional response to tcdd.

unsupervised clustering analysis  using all non-constant genes  revealed the strongest trend in the dataset was the distinction between tcdd-treated  and vehicle-treated  animals. the co-clustering of the two f <dig> crosses  may indicate that their common parentage is a stronger determinant of their transcriptional profiles than is their sensitivity or resistance to tcdd toxicity. further, this suggests that number of genes causally related to the hepatotoxicity  of tcdd is small compared with all other changes caused by tcdd in hepatic gene expression.

the extent of the overlap in transcriptional responses to tcdd among sensitive and resistant rat strains/lines was visualized using a two-way table  and venn diagrams . of the  <dig> genes interrogated,  <dig>  responded in at least one strain or line at a 1% false-discovery rate;  <dig> genes did not respond to tcdd in any strain/line . of the  <dig> responsive genes only  <dig>  were altered in more than one strain/line. only  <dig> genes responded in all strains/lines, of which  <dig> were induced while only  <dig> were genes repressed. this direction of response is concordant with our previous finding that 70% of genes altered in common by tcdd in both mouse and rat are up-regulated  <cit> .

to evaluate the overlap of significantly  altered transcripts between the sensitive and resistant collectives we formed a two-way table. a tcdd-responsive score of - <dig> ,  <dig> , or + <dig>  was assigned to each gene in each strain. the sum of the scores for the sensitive strains/lines form the columns and the sum of the scores for the resistant strains/lines are the rows. each value corresponds to the number of genes that exhibited a significant response to tcdd treatment. for example,  <dig> genes are induced in both sensitive and both resistant strains/lines, while  <dig> genes are repressed in both of the sensitive strains/lines and both of the resistant strains/lines. of the  <dig> genes examined,  <dig> genes responded in at least  <dig> strain/line, while  <dig> genes did not respond to tcdd in any rat strain/line.

the sensitive collective exhibited a greater number of responsive genes  and a greater overlap of these genes among strains/lines within the collective  than did the resistant collective . however, the proportion of tcdd-responsive genes that overlapped within each collective to the total genes on the array that responded to tcdd in that collective did not differ between collectives .

classification of type-i vs. type-ii responses to tcdd
identifying which of the  <dig> tcdd-responsive genes are most likely to be involved in major dioxin toxicities is challenging; we therefore exploited our genetic model. each tcdd-responsive gene was classified according to the type-i/type-ii tcdd response scheme previously developed for toxic endpoints  <cit> .

type-i responses to tcdd are those that are similar between dioxin-sensitive rat strains/lines and dioxin-resistant rat strains/lines. we considered genes that exhibited a statistically significant response to tcdd in all four strains/lines to be type-i genes. by this definition  <dig> genes were classified as type-i . these type-i genes include well-known  as well as novel tcdd-responsive genes . the vast majority of type-i genes  were up-regulated by tcdd . for some type-i genes the magnitude of induction was very large, including ~90-fold induction of cyp1a <dig> mrna and ~75-fold induction of aldh3a <dig> mrna.

transcriptional responses after 19-hour tcdd exposure in the four rat strains/lines were identified using affymetrix rae230a arrays followed by data pre-processing and statistical testing using linear models. twenty-five type-i genes  were identified. these included several well-established ahr-regulated and dioxin-inducible genes, supporting the validity of the array experiments. for each strain/line, the fold-change  in mrna levels between treated and control rats as well as the significance levels are presented.

type-ii responses to tcdd are those that differ between dioxin-sensitive rats and dioxin-resistant rats. genes that responded to tcdd exposure in a statistically significant manner in both members of one collective but neither of the strains/lines in the other collective are classified as type-ii genes. by this classification,  <dig> genes exhibited type-ii responses . of these, only three were altered in resistant rats but not in sensitive rats . the remaining  <dig> genes were specifically altered only in dioxin-sensitive rats. in contrast to the 80% upregulation of type-i genes, 61%  of type-ii genes were downregulated by tcdd.

validation by real-time rt-pcr
the validity of our array experiments to identify effects of tcdd on mrna levels is supported by the facts that well-established dioxin-inducible genes were identified  and there is overlap between our current list of responsive genes and genes previously reported to be affected by ahr-ligands in other array experiments  <cit> .

to further assess the validity of our array results we employed real-time rt-pcr to evaluate effects of tcdd on mrna levels. genes were selected for rt-pcr analysis to span a wide range of magnitudes of response . to this end, both array  and rt-pcr analyses  showed a high magnitude of tcdd-mediated induction of the prototypical responsive/ahr-activated gene cyp1a <dig>  <cit> . further, cyp7a <dig> and chka exhibited medium magnitudes of response to tcdd in both collectives as evidenced by rt-pcr assays  as well as, array experiments . selenbp <dig> and per <dig> showed low magnitudes of tcdd-mediated induction in both collectives as evidenced by array experiments  and slightly higher magnitudes of induction by rt-pcr assays . elov <dig> exhibited significant induction in the dioxin-sensitive collective but not in the resistant collective as assayed both by array  and rt-pcr . tcdd had no significant effect on mrna levels for klf <dig> or pik3r <dig> as assayed either by rt-pcr  or by gene array .

transcriptional responses after  <dig> hours tcdd exposure in the four rat strains/lines were identified using affymetrix rae230a arrays followed by data pre-processing and statistical testing using linear models. type-ii genes were identified as those where both strains/lines in one collective showed statistically significant responses to tcdd  in the same direction, while both strains/lines in the other collective showed no response . for each strain/line, the fold-change  in mrna levels between treated and control rats as well as the significance levels are presented. genes are sorted alphabetically by gene symbol.

analysis of the ahr role in regulation
it is well-established that major toxicities of tcdd require the ahr  <cit> . to determine if the ahr was required for the gene to respond to tcdd we compared hepatic mrna levels for a few genes in ahr-null mice  versus mice with wildtype ah receptor . mice were treated with a dose of tcdd equitoxic to that in sensitive rats  <cit>  for a comparable time. as expected, induction of cyp1a <dig> mrna was strictly dependent on the ahr . suppression of crip <dig> mrna levels also was ahr-dependent . regulation of chka and elovl <dig> by tcdd appears to be species-specific: chka mrna was upregulated in rats from both collectives  but was significantly downregulated in ahr-null mice and unaffected in wildtype mice ; elovl <dig> was upregulated in dioxin-sensitive rats  but elovl <dig> was unresponsive to tcdd in both wildtype and ahr-null mice . the findings with chka and elovl <dig> reinforce recent reports of substantial differences between rat and mouse in transcriptional responses to tcdd  <cit> .

pathway analysis
to determine if alterations in mrna abundances caused by tcdd are functionally coherent, we performed two gene ontology  analyses. the first used candidate genes from each rat strain/line to determine the extent of overlap of pathways between rat strains/lines. we found that the pathways dysregulated by tcdd were very similar in the two dioxin-resistant rats, lna and h/w  and in the two dioxin-sensitive rats, lnc and l-e . further, there was overlap in pathways among all strains/lines:  <dig> go terms were enriched in all four strains/lines, while  <dig> go terms were specifically enriched in only the sensitive strains .

the second analysis used both type-i and type-ii gene lists to determine the specific go terms enriched in each of the type-i and type-ii gene lists. this analysis identified  <dig> go terms - mostly relating to cytochrome p <dig> genes - enriched in the type-i genes . amongst the type-ii genes, the analysis identified  <dig> go terms specifically enriched . in particular, genes related to the endoplasmic reticulum were present about  <dig> times as often as expected by chance alone, as were genes related to lipid metabolism.

gene ontology  analysis was used to determine if genes exhibiting type-i  or type-ii  character were functionally coherent. lists of type-i and type-ii genes generated as described in the results were tested for enrichment of each go category represented on the rae230a array. false-discovery rates  were calculated with  <dig> permutations of the dataset using the high-throughput gominer software, bolding highlights those terms with a fdr <5%. enrichment values are expressed in log2-space . note that go: <dig>  is enriched in both the type-i and type-ii gene lists.

discussion
we performed transcriptional profiling on livers of rats that are sensitive or resistant to major tcdd toxicities. two key findings arise. first, we show significant inter-strain and inter-species diversity in responses to tcdd. second, we identify type-ii genes that may be integral to the mechanism of hepatotoxicity, wasting and lethality.

significant diversity of intra-species and inter-species responses to tcdd
one startling characteristic of the transcriptional response to tcdd across the four rat strains/lines are the dramatic inter-strain differences. given their substantial genetic relatedness, including at the ahr locus, it might be hypothesized that lna and h/w animals would have very similar responses, and that lnc would be very similar to l-e. to the contrary,  <dig> %  of dioxin-responsive genes were altered in one of the four rat strains/lines. these results clearly demonstrate the importance of genomic context in regulating mrna responses to dioxin-exposure and mirror an analysis of the basal mrna levels in these and other rat strains . interestingly, in rats with the ahrh/w genotype, the total number of genes that respond was reduced relative to rats expressing wildtype ahr. however, ahrs from rats with the ahrh/w genotype have similar affinity for tcdd and ability to bind ah response elements as wildtype rats  <cit> . it is conceivable that ahrh/w rats have a reduced ability to recruit coactivators and interact with transcriptional machinery. chromatin immuno-precipitation experiments would be valuable in testing this hypothesis directly.

when we attempted to study ahr-dependency of the mrna changes by comparison with ahr-/- mice we found that only  <dig> of  <dig> mrna responses to tcdd, measured by rt-pcr, could be compared in both rat and mouse models. this result concords with recent reports of highly divergent transcriptomic responses to tcdd between rat and mouse  <cit> , and suggests that combining our intra-species rat model with inter-species studies may be a fruitful approach for identifying genes that mediate tcdd-induced toxicities, especially those toxic responses that differ between animal species.

type-ii responsive genes whose regulation by tcdd may be integral to the mechanism of hepatotoxicity, wasting and lethality
in dioxin-sensitive rats, a wasting syndrome commences within the first few days following a single dose of tcdd and is characterized by progressive weight loss  and hypophagia  <cit> . wasting contributes to lethality starting 2- <dig> weeks after tcdd exposure. although wasting accompanies death, wasting per se is not likely to be the sole reason for death since maintenance of body weight by parenteral nutrition does not prevent mortality  <cit> . nevertheless, untreated control rats, pair-fed at the same caloric intake as rats treated with lethal tcdd doses, die at much the same time as their tcdd-exposed partners  <cit> .

the cause of tcdd-induced wasting and ultimate death as well as the key target tissue remain elusive. since tcdd causes extensive hepatotoxicity in tcdd-sensitive rats , it is reasonable that examination of mechanisms which produce hepatotoxicity may provide clues to mechanisms of wasting and lethality. to this end, we identified  <dig> type-ii hepatic genes whose tcdd-responsiveness differed between tcdd-resistant and tcdd-sensitive rats. pathway analysis indicated that these genes are mainly involved in lipid-metabolism, cellular membrane function and energy metabolism . these type-ii genes potentially explain why there are greater manifestations of hepatotoxicity in sensitive rats than in resistant rats; for example, a dramatic accumulation of fatty acids  and initial liver hypertrophy which switches to atrophy ~ <dig> week later . pohjanvirta et al.  <cit> , in biochemical studies, found that exposure of sensitive rats to tcdd led to steatosis, hypertrophy, liver failure, wasting and eventual death, possibly as the consequence of derailment of energy metabolism due to alterations of  lipid homeostasis,  protein metabolism and/or  atp production/utilization.

 alteration of lipid homeostasis
in sensitive rats only, we previously observed steatosis with the accumulated fatty acids probably originating from redistribution of peripheral fat deposits to liver rather than from increased lipid synthesis within the liver  <cit> . this is consistent with our current transcriptomic study in which transcripts related to lipid synthesis were not increased. tcdd-induced suppression of hepatic lipid lipogenesis previously has been reported  <cit> .

pathway analysis indicated that genes involved in the lipid metabolism process were enriched in the type-ii gene list. of particular interest was the decreased expression of hsd11b <dig> and slc27a <dig> only in sensitive rats. hsd11b <dig> functions in steroid metabolism and colocalizes with the glucocorticoid receptor where it acts as a local amplifier of corticoid responses including the regulation of fuel metabolism during starvation and stress  <cit> . hsd11b <dig> deficiencies in rodents increase energy expenditure, decrease weight gain with chronic high fat feeding, increase weight loss, increase hepatic lipid oxidation while decreasing lipolysis in adipose tissue and display many metabolic deficiencies  <cit> . slc27a <dig> encodes a transporter of long-chain fatty acids into the liver where it is exclusively expressed. its deletion results in increased de novo biosynthesis of long-chain fatty acids in liver due to inhibited uptake of them. interestingly, in knockout mice, feed intake is depressed, energy expenditure increased and weight gain suppressed  <cit> . while further study of these genes is warranted, genes that alter lipid homeostasis may be important in hepatotoxicity and could be involved in pro-death pathways in sensitive rats exposed to tcdd.

 altered protein metabolism
in the short term, protein catabolism can be a beneficial response to provide amino acids for energy and maintenance of obligatory functions. however, sustained protein catabolism eventually leads to wasting and mortality. our current study found that tcdd increased expression of genes that facilitate protein breakdown  but also decreased the expression of ass <dig>  the key enzyme in the urea cycle. deficiencies in ass <dig> may disrupt the urea cycle resulting in increased accumulation of amino acids, highly toxic ammonia and other toxic byproducts. tcdd previously has been shown to decrease the expression of the ass <dig> gene after  <dig> hour exposure  <cit> . increased protein breakdown and deficiencies in the urea cycle are consistent with previous reports of elevated plasma levels of most amino acids and decreased plasma urea in sensitive rats but not in resistant rats  <dig> days after tcdd exposure  <cit> . in addition, alteration of the balance between protein synthesis versus protein degradation is a key mechanism in switching hepatocytes from hypertrophy to atrophy, as observed in sensitive rats ~ <dig> week after tcdd exposure  <cit>  and reported for other wasting diseases   <cit> . thus, specific genes involved in protein homeostasis are likely important in tcdd-mediated pro-survival pathways.

 impaired atp production/utilization
derailment of energy metabolism due to impaired atp production or utilization potentially contributes to manifestations of major tcdd toxicities. after tcdd exposure in sensitive rats, compensatory mechanisms may attempt to increase energy for metabolism by increasing expression of the atp5c <dig> gene that resides within the atp synthesis pathway and is down-regulated in obese subjects  <cit> . however, tcdd decreased expression levels of adk which catalyzes the inter-conversion of adenine nucleotides, and plays an important role in cellular energy homeostasis ; this downregulation may impair use of atp as an energy source in sensitive rats. specifically, adk impairment leads to deficiencies in adenosine nucleotides, including atp, likely leading to reduced mitochondrial metabolic capacity and impairment of lipid metabolism critical for energy production  <cit> . moreover, adk-deficient mice display hepatic steatosis within  <dig> days and die within  <dig> days with fatty liver  <cit> . thus, deficiencies in adenosine metabolism are powerful contributors to development of hepatic steatosis and development of lethal fatty liver, processes that are also provoked by tcdd in sensitive rats.

in dioxin-resistant rats, where tcdd does not cause severe hepatotoxicity, wasting or death, there was no alteration of mrna levels for genes which might derail energy metabolism due to alterations of in the homeostasis of lipids, protein metabolism or atp production/utilization. only three genes responded to tcdd in the resistant collective but not in the sensitive collective. two of these three genes function in lipid metabolism: the expression of phyh was increased while that of hacl <dig> was decreased. the third gene il1r <dig>  whose levels were increased by tcdd, is a receptor whose responsiveness regulates several biological functions, including adaptive and innate immunity, control of programmed cell death and stress response  <cit> . the consequences of altered regulation of these genes in mediating potential pro-survival pathways in response to tcdd warrants further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
the mechanisms of dioxin-induced toxicities remain elusive but our transcriptomic approach in an in vivo rat model where there are major phenotypic differences in the toxic response is providing clues to the early events that may trigger toxicity. compelling evidence shows that the transcriptional activity of the ahr is essential for toxicity. because altered transcription is central to tcdd toxicity, our group and others have profiled changes of mrna abundance resulting from exposure to tcdd in several model systems. the results are remarkable: tcdd induces wide-spread alterations in mrna abundance, but only a very small fraction of these changes are conserved between mouse or rat and, as demonstrated here, within different rat strains. only  <dig> % of dioxin-responsive genes are altered in more than one of the four rat strains/lines.

this diversity of transcriptional responses makes it challenging to identify specific genes responsible for lethality and other major forms of dioxin toxicity. our results suggest that hepatic toxicity probably is not caused by dysregulation of a single critical gene. rather, pathways such as lipid metabolism or energy metabolism may be derailed by altered transcription of multiple genes, possibly under coordinate control of the ahr with participation of other regulatory factors. pathways and individual genes highlighted here are worthy candidates for further mechanistic studies to test their role in mediating or protecting from major dioxin toxicities.
