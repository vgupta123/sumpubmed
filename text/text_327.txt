BACKGROUND
the small ran gtpase plays key roles during the cell cycle in eukaryotic cells  <cit> . generation of rangtp from rangdp requires a ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor  known as regulator of chromosome condensation  <dig>  in vertebrates  <cit> . rcc <dig> is localised predominantly to chromatin throughout the cell cycle  <cit> . hydrolysis of gtp to gdp by ran is greatly stimulated by ran gtpase-activating protein  in the cytoplasm  <cit> . the distinct localisation of these regulators results in a high concentration of rangtp relative to that of rangdp in the vicinity of chromatin  <cit> . within the nucleus, rangtp promotes the assembly of export complexes between proteins carrying a leucine-rich nuclear export signal  and exportin , while causing the disassembly of imported complexes formed between proteins carrying a lysine-rich nuclear import signal  and importins. thus, rangtp determines the direction of nucleocytoplasmic transport during interphase  <cit> . in animal cells in which the nuclear envelope breaks down during mitosis and the separation of the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm is lost, continued generation of rangtp on chromosomes by rcc <dig> is thought to provide a spatial signal to organise spindle assembly  <cit> . localised generation of rangtp by rcc <dig> on chromatin is therefore critical for the function of the ran system throughout the cell cycle  <cit> .

rcc <dig> has a core domain with a 7-bladed propeller structure  <cit>  that interacts on one face with ran  <cit>  and is proposed to interact on the other face with chromatin  <cit> , possibly through core histones h2a and h2b  <cit> . near to the n-terminus is a short flexible region that contains a functional lysine-rich nuclear localisation signal  that associates with the import receptor dimer formed by importin-α <dig> and importin-β  <cit> . in vitro, this basic n-terminal region  or tail can interact directly with dna  <cit>  and in cells it is involved in both the concentration of rcc <dig> in the nucleus and in its interaction with chromatin  <cit> . rcc <dig> is modified in cells by removal of the initial n-terminal methionine and mono-, di- or tri-methylation of the α-amino group of the new n-terminal residue . this modification is present throughout the cell cycle and promotes the localisation of rcc <dig> to mitotic chromosomes  <cit> . during mitosis, phosphorylation of rcc <dig> at serine  <dig> and serine  <dig> by cdk1-cyclin b <dig> dissociates rcc <dig> from importin-α3-importin-β and regulates its interaction with chromatin  <cit> . in mammalian cells, rcc <dig> exists in at least three isoforms , which are probably generated by alternative splicing of the mrna. rcc1β and rcc1γ have unique inserts after residue  <dig> which alter the length of their n-terminal tails. in the case of rcc1γ, a  <dig> amino acid insert stabilises its interaction with chromatin, reduces importin binding and alters its regulation by phosphorylation at serine  <dig>  <cit> .

studies using rcc <dig> fused to green fluorescent protein  have shown that its interaction with chromatin in live cells is highly dynamic  <cit> . the rate of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  on chromatin is regulated by the association of gfp-rcc1α with ran  <cit> . mutation of aspartate  <dig> of rcc1α , which inhibits its guanine nucleotide exchange activity, destabilises the interaction of its gfp fusion with chromatin  <cit> . conversely, co-expression of rant24n, a mutant defective in nucleotide binding that forms a stable complex with rcc <dig> and inhibits its guanine nucleotide exchange activity  <cit> , strongly stabilises the interaction of gfp-rcc1α with chromatin  <cit> . gfp-rant24n associates stably with chromatin throughout the cell cycle and co-localises with rcc <dig>  consistent with formation of a stable binary complex with rcc <dig>  <cit> . li et al.  <cit>  proposed that the association of rcc <dig> with nucleotide-free ran  in a transient binary complex stabilises its interaction with chromatin, thereby linking the interaction of rcc <dig> with chromatin to generation of ran-gtp. more recently, hao and macara  <cit>  have developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer -based reporter in which rcc1α was fused to cfp at its n-terminal and yfp at its c-terminal . they showed that binding of rant24n or aporanwt to cfp-rcc1α-yfp caused a conformational change in the n-terminal tail, which stabilised the interaction of cfp-rcc1α-yfp with dna in vitro and with chromatin in permeabilised cells. these authors proposed a model in which the interaction of ran with rcc <dig> allosterically induces a conformational change in the n-terminal tail, which then interacts with dna and thereby stabilises the association of rcc <dig> with chromatin. in these experiments, however, the role of α-n-methylation, which was by necessity abolished in the cfp-rcc1α-yfp reporter, could not be tested. the role of the n-terminal tail in the interaction of the rcc1-ran binary complex with chromatin also remained to be demonstrated in vivo.

here, we have tested the mechanism of the interaction of rcc1α with chromatin in live cells using frap of gfp fusions. we show that the α-n-methylated tail of rcc1α is important for the stability of the interaction of rcc1α with interphase chromatin. indeed, the methylated tail is required for the stabilising effect of rant24n. these results provide strong support for an allosteric model of the interaction of the rcc1-ran binary complex with chromatin in vivo.

RESULTS
the n-terminal tail of rcc <dig> is required for stable association with interphase chromatin
to examine the role of the n-terminal region  or tail of rcc1α in its dynamic interaction with chromatin in live cells, we made n-terminal and c-terminal gfp fusion constructs of the rcc1α n-terminal tail , the rcc <dig> core domain  and full-length rcc1α. we also fused the rcc <dig> core domain with a classical lysine-rich monopartite nuclear localisation signal  derived from sv <dig> t antigen  to generate sv <dig> nls-Δ27rcc <dig> . when expressed in hela cells, this gfp fusion construct was concentrated in nuclei like full length rcc1α . gfp proteins expressed from the same vectors as the n-terminal and c-terminal tagged proteins  were used as controls. to monitor the dynamic interaction between rcc <dig> with chromatin, we performed fluorescent recovery after photobleaching  experiments on nuclei in live hela cells expressing the gfp fusion constructs .

as expected, n-term-gfp alone freely diffused in nuclei with half-time  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s   . the frap half-time of gfp-rcc1α was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s  whereas t1/ <dig> of gfp-Δ27rcc <dig> was decreased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s , consistent with a stabilising role for the n-terminal tail in the interaction of rcc1α with interphase chromatin  <cit> . however, gfp-sv <dig> nls-Δ27rcc <dig> was as mobile as the full-length rcc1α with the frap t1/ <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s . these data indicate that, in the context of the n-terminal fusion with gfp, which cannot be α-n-methylated, the positively charged residues in the nls of rcc1α weakly stabilise its interaction with chromatin. when the gfp is fused to the n-terminus, the weak stabilising effect is not specific to the tail of rcc1α and it can be replaced by another lysine-rich nls-containing sequence.

when full-length rcc1α fused to gfp at its c-terminus was monitored it exhibited a much more stable association with chromatin than the n-terminal gfp tagged fusion protein, with a frap t1/ <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s  . Δ27rcc1-gfp was considerably less stable  than rcc1α-gfp, but was still significantly more stable than gfp-Δ27rcc <dig>  the frap t1/ <dig> of sv <dig> nls-Δ27rcc1-gfp was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s. , which was intermediate between Δ27rcc1-gfp and rcc1α-gfp. thus, the free n-terminal tail of rcc1α stabilises the association of protein with interphase chromatin in live cells. this stabilising effect can be partially reproduced by another basic nls sequence.

to test whether the n-terminal tail alone is sufficient to interact with chromatin, the mobility of the isolated ntr-gfp was monitored. the frap t1/ <dig> of the isolated ntr-gfp  was as mobile as that of the gfp alone . similarly, the monopartite sv <dig> nls-gfp was nuclear and the frap t1/ <dig>  was not different from either gfp alone or ntr-gfp. thus, the nls-containing n-terminal tail of rcc1α is insufficient to stabilise interaction with chromatin unless it is joined to the core domain.

stable ran binding to rcc <dig> regulates the dynamic interaction of rcc <dig> with chromatin in an n-terminal tail-dependent manner in live cells
we next confirmed that the binding of rant24n to rcc1α stabilises the interaction of rcc1α with chromatin in live human cells. u2os cells were transiently co-transfected with gfp alone or rcc1α-gfp together with the fluorescent protein mcherry alone, mcherry fused to wild-type ran  or mcherry fused to rant24n . as expected, the frap t1/ <dig> of rcc1α-gfp in cells co-expressing mcherry-rant24n was significantly increased compared to that of rcc1α-gfp in cells co-expressing either mcherry or mcherry-ranwt . in addition, the mobile fraction of rcc1α-gfp, calculated as the proportion of the initial fluorescent signal that is recovered after photobleaching, was significantly reduced in cells in which mcherry-rant24n was co-expressed with rcc1α-gfp compared to cells co-expressing either mcherry or mcherry-ranwt . therefore, rant24n specifically stabilises the interaction of rcc1α with chromatin in live cells.

fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  data derived from live u2os cells co-expressing gfp, rcc1α-gfp, Δ27rcc1-gfp, rcc1α k4q-gfp, rcc1αd182a. the table summarises the mean +/- standard deviation  of frap half-time and mobile fraction of each of the gfp fusion constructs in the nuclei of cells that also expressed mcherry, mcherry-ranwt or mcherry-rant24n. the number of cells used in each case is given .

to test whether stabilization of interaction of rcc1α with chromatin by rant24n requires the n-terminal tail of rcc1α, we co-expressed a series of rcc1α-gfp fusion proteins  with mcherry alone, mcherry-ranwt and mcherry-rant24n in u2os cells. as expected, rcc1α-gfp localized to the nucleus, as did rcc1αk4q-gfp and rcc1αd182a-gfp, whereas Δ27rcc1-gfp was also present in the cytoplasm . frap experiments on these gfp fusions  showed that the frap t1/ <dig> of rcc1α-gfp was significantly increased when mcherry-rant24n was co-expressed compared to when mcherry or mcherry-ranwt were co-expressed . the truncated version of rcc <dig> lacking the n-terminal tail  showed a dramatic decrease in the frap t1/ <dig>  compared to the full-length protein  . however, Δ27rcc1-gfp failed to interact more stably in the presence of mcherry-rant24n . these results show that the binding of ran to rcc1α stabilises the interaction of rcc1α with chromatin in an n-terminal tail-dependent manner in live cells. consistent results were also found using n-terminal gfp fusions of rcc1α, although the proteins were all more dynamic  in their interactions with chromatin than the equivalent c-terminal gfp tagged proteins .

α-n-terminal methylation of rcc1α is required for the stabilization of its interaction with chromatin by rant24n
rcc1α is α-n-terminally methylated throughout the cell cycle and this modification promotes the localisation of rcc1α to mitotic chromosomes  <cit> . to test whether α-n-terminal methylation is important for dynamic association of rcc <dig> with interphase chromatin, we made a mutant of rcc1α , which prevents methylation  <cit> . as expected, α-n-terminal methylation was completely blocked in rcc1αk4q-gfp and was also absent in Δ27rcc1-gfp but was present in rcc1α-gfp, as well as rcc1αd182a-gfp, which has inhibited guanine nucleotide exchange activity  <cit>  . the mobility of rcc1αk4q-gfp on interphase chromatin was significantly increased  compared to that of wild-type rcc1α-gfp  . rcc1αk4q-gfp also did not associate with chromatin more stably in cells co-expressing rant24n, in contrast to wild type rcc1α-gfp. thus, α-n-terminal methylation of rcc1α plays a role in its dynamic interaction with interphase chromatin and this modification is important for stabilisation of the interaction with chromatin by rant24n.

α-n-terminal methylation of rcc1α is not regulated by rant24n
we tested further the relationship between the α-n-terminal methylation of rcc1α and stabilising effect of rant24n on the interaction of rcc1α with chromatin. we found that the co-expression of mcherry-ranwt or mcherry-rant24n in cells did not affect the α-n-terminal methylation of rcc1α-gfp or endogenous rcc <dig> when compared to the co-expression of mcherry alone . therefore, rant24n does not stabilise the interaction of rcc1α with chromatin by inducing the α-n-terminal methylation of rcc1α. conversely, immunoprecipitation of rcc1α-gfp and rcc1αk4q-gfp in the presence of edta, which chelates mg2+ and releases nucleotides from ran to form aporan  <cit> , showed that endogenous ran formed a stable complex with both rcc1α-gfp and rcc1αk4q-gfp . furthermore, removal of the n-terminal tail did not affect the association of aporan with rcc1α under these conditions, showing that the methylated n-terminal tail is not required for binding to aporan. these data indicate that the α-n-terminal methylation of rcc1α does not affect its association with aporan. thus, the α-n-terminal methylation of rcc1α and the association of the protein with ran appear to be independent events.

inhibition of the gef activity of rcc1α partially destabilises its interaction with chromatin but does not prevent a stabilising effect of rant24n
mutation of aspartate  <dig> of rcc1α to alanine  strongly reduces kcat of its guanine nucleotide exchange activity towards ran  <cit> . aspartate  <dig> does not interact with ran directly but rather forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond that stabilises the interaction of arginine  <dig> of rcc1α with the ran p loop  <cit> . however, the d182a mutant of rcc1α has been found to disrupt mitosis  <cit>  and does not rescue the effects of the mislocalisation of rcc1α through removal of the n-terminal tail  <cit> . these effects suggest that the d182a mutant has a dominant effect on the ran system in cells and is not simply neutral.

in agreement with previous results using rcc1α tagged at the n-terminal with gfp  <cit>  we found that interaction of rcc1αd182a-gfp with chromatin was more dynamic than the wild-type rcc1α-gfp, showing that this mutation decreased the stability of the interaction of rcc1α with chromatin . this suggests that the exchange activity of rcc <dig> promotes its interaction with chromatin. nevertheless, we found that co-expression of mcherry-rant24n stabilised the interaction of rcc1αd182a-gfp with chromatin in live cells. consistent with this observation, rcc1αd182a -gfp tagged with a flag epitope , like wild-type rcc1α-gfp-flag and rcc1αk4q-gfp-flag, precipitated ran from cells under mg2+-chelated conditions, i.e. when a stable complex between rcc1α and aporan is formed . therefore, we show that d182a mutant of rcc1α still interacts with aporan and this binary complex is sufficiently stable in the absence of guanine nucleotide binding for it to be co-precipitated. the stabilising effect of rant24n on the interaction of rcc1αd182a with chromatin indicates that the d182a mutation does not prevent the allosteric effect of ran on the n-terminal tail of rcc1α.

discussion
in vitro, the stable association of nucleotide-free ran with rcc1α produces a conformational change in the n-terminal tail that promotes binding to dna and reduces affinity for core histones  <cit> . in cells, however, the interaction of rcc <dig> isoforms with chromatin is highly dynamic and is affected by post-translational modification of the tail. our results confirm that this dynamic interaction is regulated by the association of ran with rcc1α. a ran mutant  that associates stably with rcc1α in a binary complex strongly reduces the mobility of rcc1α on chromatin, and this effect requires the methylated n-terminal tail of rcc1α.

our results are consistent with a model in which aporan  associates with the core domain of rcc1α and induces allosterically a conformational change in the n-terminal tail that stabilises interaction with chromatin. rcc1α associates weakly with chromatin through its core domain, possibly through interactions with core histones  <cit> . the interaction of nucleotide-bound ran with rcc1α releases the nucleotide from ran, forming a transient binary complex in which a conformational change in rcc1α exposes its n-terminal domain and stabilises its interaction with chromatin , possibly through direct interaction with dna, although this remains to be confirmed in vivo. other isoforms of rcc <dig> differ in the length of their n-terminal tails and in the turnover rate of their dynamic interactions with chromatin in cells  <cit> , but it is likely that all isoforms interact with chromatin through a similar mechanism, albeit with differing affinities depending on the composition of the tail.

our results with the d182a mutant of rcc1α, which inhibits guanine nucleotide exchange activity, are consistent with a model in which the dynamic interaction of rcc1α with chromatin is linked to its interaction with ran. previous experiments by azuma and colleagues  <cit>  using purified proteins have shown that the d182a mutant of rcc1α forms a binary complex with aporan at a reduced rate compared to wild-type rcc1α, and the aporan-rcc1αd182a complex dissociates slowly even in the absence of free guanine nucleotide whereas the wild-type binary complex is stable. however, addition of guanine nucleotide causes rapid dissociation of both the rcc1α wild-type and d182a binary complexes  <cit> . therefore the t24n mutation of ran  can be envisaged to stabilise even the interaction with rcc1αd182a to an extent and thereby promote the chromatin-binding conformation of this binary complex in cells. nevertheless, the combination of reduced association rate of aporan with rcc1αd182a and likely increased dissociation rate of aporan from rcc1αd182a results in the interaction of rcc1αd182a with chromatin being more dynamic than wild-type rcc1α even when rant24n is present.

in agreement with the partial stabilising effect of rant24n on the interaction of rcc1αd182a with chromatin, we have also observed a complex formed between rcc1αd182a and ran under mg2+-chelating conditions, which promote the nucleotide-free form of ran . this suggests that the aporan-rcc1αd182a binary complex might be more stable in cells than was predicted. indeed, the stability of the wild-type aporan-rcc1α binary complex when it interacts with chromatin is not yet known. a recent study of the interaction of rcc1α with nucleosomes in solution has suggested the interesting possibility that ran could interact with rcc1α on chromatin in a different conformation from the crystallised binary complex  <cit> , although the formation of such a distinct complex under cellular conditions remains to be confirmed. whatever its conformation, the assembly of a complex between ran and rcc1αd182a that does not result in the efficient loading of ran with gtp provides an explanation for the inhibitory effect of this mutant on mitosis  <cit> .

the precise relationship between the dynamics of the interaction of rcc1α with chromatin and its guanine nucleotide exchange activity is, however, not yet certain. in one model, they are tightly coupled: binding of nucleotide to aporan causes ran-gtp  to dissociate from rcc1α, then rcc1α is released from chromatin and the n-terminal tail folds back against the core domain . although rcc1α can catalyse the reaction equally well from gdp to gtp and vice versa, the presence of accessory factors and the higher concentration of gtp than gdp in cells results in net loading of ran with gtp. alternatively, rcc1α could remain associated with chromatin for more than one guanine nucleotide exchange reaction if its dissociation from chromatin is slower than the release of ran.

the conformational change in the n-terminal tail and/or its interaction with chromatin may be regulated by post-translational mechanisms as well as through the binding of ran to rcc <dig> isoforms. throughout the cell cycle, mono-, di- or tri-methylation of the α-amino group promotes the interaction with chromatin  <cit> , whereas in mitosis, phosphorylation of serines  <dig> and  <dig> makes the interaction more dynamic  <cit> . we have found that α-n-terminal methylation of rcc1α is not affected by its stable association with ran. we therefore favour the idea that post-translational modification of the n-terminal tail is relatively stable and is not tightly linked to the cycle of association and dissociation of rcc <dig> with chromatin, but rather alters the equilibrium of this interaction towards association with chromatin.

CONCLUSIONS
stabilisation of the dynamic interaction of rcc1α with chromatin by ran requires the α-n-methylated n-terminal tail of rcc1α. this is consistent with the transient formation of the binary complex between rcc <dig> and ran in which n-terminal tail of rcc <dig> undergoes a conformational change that allows it to interact more stably with chromatin. the coupling between the association of rcc <dig> with ran and its interaction with chromatin provides an unusual mechanism to localise the generation of ran-gtp.
