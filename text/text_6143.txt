BACKGROUND
edwardsiella tarda, a member of the family enterobacteriaceae, has been isolated from a variety of animals including fish and mammals  <cit> . in pathology, this bacterium is a known causative agent of a fish disease  named edwardsiellosis. ever since the first report of edwardsiellosis in  <dig>  <cit> , the mass mortality of fish caused by this bacterium has been a serious issue in aquaculture  <cit> . e. tarda can infect a variety of fish species, including japanese eel , european eel , japanese flounder , turbot , yellowtail , red sea bream , channel catfish , and tilapia . e. tarda also causes diarrhea in humans .

the type and virulence of the e. tarda strains have been examined by serological analysis and infection test, respectively. the isolates from japanese eel, japanese flounder and eel pond, were classified into four serotypes  by the o-agglutination test  <cit> . the e. tarda that are highly virulent to fish are serotype a strains, but these strains do not always share the same biological traits. in particular, atypical serotype a strains of e. tarda isolated from red sea bream and yellowtail were non-motile, unlike the more typical serotype a strains  <cit> . to investigate the virulence of e. tarda in fish, the infection test was performed using both the japanese flounder and red sea bream as hosts. while all the serotype a strains of e. tarda are, in principle, virulent to japanese flounder, the atypical strains were reported to be virulent only in red sea bream  <cit> .

regarding the genomic data of e. tarda, a complete genome sequence of the turbot pathogenic strain eib <dig>  was reported in  <dig>  <cit>  and strain fl6- <dig> was sequenced in  <dig>  <cit> . the genome sequence of the human pathogenic strain atcc <dig> was also determined and annotated, but the sequence is still fragmented. in addition, the complete genome sequence of edwardsiella ictaluri <cit> , a close relative of e. tarda and causative agent of enteric septicemia in catfish, is currently available  <cit> . a recent whole genome comparison of multiple e. tarda strains showed that e. tarda genotypes were broadly clustered into two groups, edwgi and edwgii, which consisted of strains that were isolated mainly from fish and human, respectively  <cit> . edwgi represents a genotype of fish pathogens in the edwardsiella lineage and the genes of virulence factors such as type iii secretion system , type vi secretion system , hemolysin, flagellin, adhesin, invasin, and fimbriae have been identified in strains from this group  <cit> .

the relationships between the edwgi and edwgii genotypes and the a–d serotypes are not fully understood. serotype a strains are virulent to fish, indicating that these strains are evolutionarily closely related to the edwgi genotype. on the other hand, two unique dna sequences from atypical serotype a strains have been detected. these dna sequences were found to encode a novel t6ss and the type v secretion system   <cit> . thus, there is a possibility that the virulence mechanism of serotype a/ewdgi e. tarda may differ between the typical and atypical strains, consistent with the reported host specificity in the infection test. in this study, we sequenced the genomes of four serotype e. tarda isolates  from aquaculture fishes or environmental water, and performed comparative analyses of the structure of the genomes and their virulence-related gene repertoire using the reference genome sequences such as those of eib <dig> and atcc <dig>  we demonstrated that fish-pathogenic and environmental e. tarda were clearly distinguishable at the sequence and gene repertoire level, and found that a single genotype proposed previously for fish-pathogenic strains could be further classified into two genotypes, typical and atypical. strikingly, we report that an atypical strain of e. tarda has a pathogenicity island that is homologous to the pathogenicity islands of virulent escherichia coli strains, which are causative agents of outbreaks of human foodborne illness.

methods
strains
for genome sequencing, we selected eight strains of e. tarda , seven of which were of the four major serotypes a to d. serotype a strains nuf <dig>  e <dig> and fpc <dig> were isolated from japanese flounder, japanese eel, and red sea bream, respectively. the e <dig> strain has undergone attenuation during cultivation, and fpc <dig> is a non-motile atypical strain. nuf <dig> was kindly donated by prof. kanai . the su <dig> , su <dig> , su <dig> , and su <dig>  strains are environmental : su <dig> was isolated from the gut of a healthy eel, and the other three were from eel ponds. we also sequenced the genome of a publicly available strain, atcc <dig>  which is a causative agent of human diarrhea, and used the data to evaluate the sequence accuracy in this study.
e. tarda 
strains sequenced in this study

to compare the genome sequences of the eight e. tarda strains with the genomes of related species, we downloaded the sequences of three e. tarda strains, eib <dig>  and its plasmid peib <dig> , fl6- <dig>  and plasmid pfl6- <dig> , and atcc <dig> , as well as the complete genome sequence of the e. ictaluri strain 93– <dig> . for phylogenetic analysis, the nucleotide sequences of dna gyrase subunit b genes  were extracted from the genome data and from the unannotated contig data of e. tarda  <dig>  and e. ictaluri atcc <dig> . to compare the synteny of the pathogenicity islands in e. tarda, enteropathogenic escherichia coli o <dig> , enteropathogenic e. coli o <dig> , and pantoea ananatis lmg  <dig>  were also downloaded from the genbank database.

sample preparation and genome sequencing
the eight strains of e. tarda were individually cultured in  <dig> ml of heart infusion broth at 25°c for  <dig> hours. bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation for  <dig> min at  <dig> × g. genomic dna of each strain was extracted from the bacterial pellets using maxwell  <dig> dna purification kit . paired-end shotgun libraries  were prepared from 1– <dig> μg of genomic dna using paired-end dna sample prep kit and multiplexing sample preparation oligonucleotide kit  according to the manufacturer’s protocols. the dna concentration of each library was analyzed on a high sensitivity dna chip with an agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer . each library  was subjected to cluster amplification on a paired end flow cell v <dig> with a cbot instrument and then sequenced on an illumina genome analyzer iix for  <dig> ×  <dig> cycles using illumina sequencing kit v <dig> reagent .

additional whole genome shotgun sequencing of e. tarda strain fpc <dig> was performed using roche  <dig> gs-flx+ titanium sequencing platform. using the covaris instrument ,  <dig> μg of the genomic dna was sheared into  <dig> -bp fragments. a 454-pyrosequencing library was constructed from the sheared dna by gs titanium rapid library preparation kit . pyrosequencing was performed using 1/ <dig> region of a  <dig> mm ×  <dig> mm titanium picotiter plate according to the manufacturer’s protocols . the short read sequence data that we obtained have been deposited in ddbj/embl/genbank .

snp detection and de novo assembly
we directly mapped the short reads obtained from the illumina genome analyzer iix to the genome sequence of strain eib <dig>  and detected single nucleotide polymorphisms  and insertions/deletions  using the program package, casava . de novo assembly was carried out using the abyss program  <cit>  with its parameter optimized manually. briefly, we parameterized the k-mers based on a self-blastn search result between the assembled contigs. overproduced contigs often contain redundant dna regions which are similar to each other at the sequence level; these regions are considered to be caused by misassembly. thus, we optimized k-mers in which the contig n <dig> increased and the redundant regions decreased . the  <dig> reads of e. tarda strain fpc <dig> were assembled into contigs with newbler ver.  <dig>  . the nucleotide sequences which we obtained were corrected by mapping the illumina reads onto the contigs using bwa software  <cit> . the complete t6ss locus of fps <dig> was constructed by joining two contigs using a genome walking method .

gene prediction, annotation, and horizontal gene transfer
open reading frames  in each assembled genome sequence were predicted by a combination of two gene-finding programs, glimmer <dig>  <cit>  and genemarks  <cit> . orfs predicted by either of these programs were considered as potential protein-encoding genes. gene function was inferred by blastp  <cit>  searches against the ncbi nr database  with an e-value <10- <dig> cutoff. an all-versus-all blastp search was performed among the genes in  <dig> strains of e. tarda , and an e. ictaluri strain 93– <dig> with an e-value <10- <dig> cutoff. an orthologous gene pair was defined as one reciprocal best hit. the ‘core’ gene that was conserved among the eleven strains was defined as the gene set in which any pair was defined as orthologous. the presence or absence of genes among the strains was tabularized as a matrix, and hierarchically clustered by an a function in r package, hclust. the absence of genes was confirmed by blastn with an e-value <10- <dig> cutoff against the assembled genome sequences. the horizontally transferred genes from other species were inferred using a markov model method  <cit>  which computed a horizontal transfer index  for each gene from the training model of coding and non-coding nucleotide compositions in the e. tarda genome. genes with significantly low ht indices  were considered as genes that were recently transferred from different species.

molecular phylogenetic analyses
for molecular phylogenetic analysis, multiple sequence alignments were constructed by the mafft program  <cit> . each alignment was first calculated using the deduced amino acid sequences, and then reversely translated to the nucleotide sequences. evolutionary distances between the nucleotide sequences were calculated by kimura’s two parameter method  <cit> . the phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method  <cit>  using mega <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
genome assembly
the complete genome sequences of the eight e. tarda strains, e <dig>  nuf <dig>  fpc <dig>  su <dig>  su <dig>  su <dig>  su <dig>  and atcc <dig>  ranged in length from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb . the estimated genome sizes were similar to those of the previously determined strains  and e. ictaluri . the gc content ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. the gc content of the three fish-pathogenic strains  was close to that of eib <dig>  and fl6- <dig>  and around 2% higher than the gc content of the other four strains . the four strains with the lower gc content are the environmental strains that were isolated either from pond or healthy eel gut, and their gc content was similar to that of e. ictaluri . thus we found that the fish-pathogenic and environmental strains of e. tarda were distinct from each other at the gc level.
e. tarda 
genomes

to evaluate the assembly statistics, we resequenced the public e. tarda strain atcc <dig> in parallel with the other seven e. tarda strains, and compared the data . for atcc <dig>  we obtained  <dig> contigs consisting of  <dig> , <dig> bp by de novo assembly; the public sequence had  <dig> contigs consisting of  <dig> , <dig> bp. a total of  <dig> , <dig> bp  of the  <dig> , <dig> bp mapped to the public scaffold sequence, and more than  <dig> % of mapped nucleotides were identical. we compared the average identity of all the sequenced genomes among all the strains of this study, and found that the fish-pathogenic and environmental strains were clearly different from each other at the sequence similarity level . the nucleotide sequence of the fpc <dig>  was similar to the nuf <dig>  and e <dig>  sequences, but differed by about 5%. using the genome sequence of strain eib <dig> as the reference, we compared the genomic structure among the eight strains by contig mapping . we found that the eib <dig> genome was covered almost entirely by the contigs of nuf <dig> and e <dig>  but some loci in the eib <dig> genome were absent in the other six strains. indeed, the eib <dig>  nuf <dig> and e <dig> genomes are highly similar at the sequence level , indicating that, of the eight strains, these three strains are the most closely related.

gene prediction and validation
we detected 3400– <dig> orfs in the sequenced e. tarda strains . of these predicted genes, an average of 96%  matched known sequences. for atcc <dig>  we predicted a smaller number of orfs  than was predicted in the public reference data ;  <dig> of the genes were common to both sets of data as predicted by blastp. one reason why the gene numbers are different between the two sets of atcc <dig> sequence data might be inaccuracy in genome assembly. the atcc <dig> sequence obtained in this study has more contigs  and a shorter average length than the reference sequence , implying that genes split by gaps between contigs have been missed by the gene-finding software. another feasible reason may be that the reference data are of low quality. we checked the reference gene annotations and found that  <dig> genes have incorrect lengths , suggesting that some of the reference genes are either pseudogenes or have been overestimated by false-positives . using mutual tblastn to query the protein sequences against the contig sequences, we were able to find almost all of the missing genes in each atcc <dig> sequence. finally, we confirmed that a total of  <dig>  genes in our sequence were also present in the reference sequence, and  <dig>  genes in the reference sequence were present in our atcc <dig> sequence. thus, we concluded that the genome data of the e. tarda strains of this study covered more than 99% of protein-coding loci and are accurate enough to be further compared.

gene comparison
to detect genetic differences between the e. tarda strains, we focused first on snps and indels. we mapped the nuf <dig> and e <dig> reads to the turbot pathogen strain eib <dig> genome, because we had found that the sequences were highly similar to each other . we predicted a total of  <dig> snps or indels between nuf <dig> and eib <dig>  and  <dig> between e <dig> and eib <dig> . although most of the detected snps or indels were located in non-coding regions,  <dig> and  <dig> snp/indel candidates were in the coding regions in nuf <dig> and e <dig>  respectively. in this study, we focused on nonsense or frameshift mutations in protein-coding genes , because such mutations are more likely to result in loss of function of the proteins that they encode. we found nine genes in e <dig> and only two genes in nuf <dig> that contained loss-of-function mutations. in particular, e <dig> had a nonsense mutation in the esrb of t3ss, which is involved in the virulence of e. tarda <cit> . because the e <dig> strain has been attenuated during cultivation, a few mutations may have occurred in a short period. we propose, therefore, that the mutation in esrb may be responsible for the attenuation of this strain.

we performed an all-vs-all blastp using the gene sets of eleven edwardsiella strains . we found that at least  <dig> genes were conserved among all the strains, and  <dig> genes were polymorphic, that is, each gene was absent from one or more of the eleven strains. we converted the polymorphism  of genes into a distance matrix and conducted cluster analysis. the dendrogram that we obtained was congruent with the molecular phylogenetic trees , suggesting that gene gain/loss events reflect the evolutionary scenario of the edwardsiella lineage. in particular, the gene catalogues of the fish pathogen and non-pathogen strains were clearly distinct from each other, consistent with the previous study  <cit> . in this topology, e. ictaluri was positioned between pathogenic and environmental e. tarda, suggesting that the classification and nomenclature of edwardsiella species may need to be reconsidered  <cit> . moreover, all the serotype a strains, the typical  and the atypical , were classified into a single genotype edwgi; the other serotype strains were clustered with atcc <dig>  which has an edwgii genotype . it should be noted that fpc <dig> constituted a different clade from that of the typical serotype a strains, suggesting that the edwgi group may be composed of two subgroups.

to investigate the origin of the polymorphic genes among e. tarda strains, we conducted a horizontal gene transfer analysis . we found that most of the strain-specific genes tended to be horizontally transferred , while most of the common genes were non-ht genes. interestingly, the proportion of ht genes dropped around six strains as shown in figure  <dig>  this result can be explained by our experimental design: six fish-pathogens  and five non-fish-pathogens , which corresponded to two phylogenetically distinct clades , were used in the study. thus, the observed paucity of ht genes around six strains probably reflects clade-specific loss events of ancestral genes. one may speculate that the ht genes detected in this study may be artifacts due to dna contamination in sequencing. however, we note that the ht genes common to e. tarda strains were distributed preferentially to either of the two clades , likely reflecting the gene gain events in each lineage  <cit> . in addition, many  of strain-specific ht genes annotated were mobile element genes, such as phage-, plasmid, or transposon-related ones, which is unexplainable by dna contamination. the presence/absence of virulence genes in e. tarda is summarized in table  <dig>   <cit> . fish-pathogenic strains have two secretion system genes  and pilus assembly genes. we predicted that the t3ss and t6ss genes are both non-ht genes, while the pilus assembly genes are ht genes. we concluded that the t3ss and t6ss genes originated in an ancestral edwardsiella lineage and were subsequently lost in non-pathogenic e. tarda <cit> . however, here we noted that a gene in the t6ss locus, evpp, was predicted as being an ht gene. the evpp gene is located at the end of the t6ss locus; therefore, it may have been added to the locus after the divergence of pathogenic- and non-pathogenic e. tarda <cit> . particularly, it has been shown that deletion of evpp in e. tarda significantly decreased the virulence of the pathogens in fish  <cit> . here, we propose that the ancestral t6ss of the edwardsiella lineage was not originally involved in pathogenesis and that the subsequent acquisition of evpp contributed to the virulence of e. tarda. we also compared the genes related to biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharides as o-antigens among the e. tarda strains, and found polymorphisms related to the presence/absence of rfb homologs  <cit>  , possibly due to horizontal transfer. the serotype a strains  share all the genes reported in e. tarda eib <dig>  which is characteristic of genotype edwgi  <cit> . non-pathogenic strains  are different from the serotype a strains and also from each other. this presence/absence of rfb polymorphism might explain why non-pathogenic strains have different serotypes .

nuf806-specific genes
among the eight sequenced strains in this study, we observed that nuf <dig> and eib <dig> were the closest at the genome sequence level; almost all the genes were common to both strains. however, unlike eib <dig>  nuf <dig> lacked plasmid-encoding genes, namely, the type iv secretion system  that is involved in conjugative transfer of plasmid, and the drug-resistance genes against streptomycin and chloramphenicol. therefore, nuf <dig> may be sensitive to these antibiotics. because nuf <dig> and eib <dig> are flounder pathogens with similar virulence, this finding suggested that the plasmid-encoding genes are not essential for pathogenesis in flounder.

e22-specific genes
among the eight strains in this study, e <dig> is the second closest strain to eib <dig>  although there were no major differences in the gene sets of the two strains, we found that loss-of-function mutations had occurred in some of the genes . on the other hand, we found that e <dig> had plasmid-related genes which were almost identical to corresponding genes in a conjugative plasmid  isolated from a fish-pathogenic bacterium, aeromonas hydrophila <cit> . the plasmid genes were encoded in four contigs with a total length of  <dig> kb, which covered more than 90% of the pra <dig> genome . because the gene that encodes repa  and conjugative transfer genes were included in the region, the contigs probably constitute an intact plasmid which is not integrated into the e <dig> chromosome. the plasmid of e <dig> also carries drug-resistance genes, tetra for tetracycline, sul <dig> for sulfonamides, and hipab for beta-lactams. previously, it was reported that many of the pathogenic e. tarda strains isolated from eel were resistant to tetracycline and sulfamonomethoxine, probably because of continued drug treatment in eel ponds  <cit> . the previous study had demonstrated that such drug-resistance markers may be located on an 81-kb conjugative plasmid  <cit> . we propose that the longer e <dig> plasmid is evolutionarily related to the previously reported 81-kb conjugative plasmid, and that these may share a common ancestor with the plasmids isolated from a. hydrophila <cit> .

fpc503-specific genes
we found that fpc <dig> had genes of the novel t3ss and t6ss which are not present in the other e. tarda strains in this study. these genes were predictable in strain  <dig> which is a close relative of fpc <dig> , although the contigs of  <dig> are still fragmented . therefore, the second t3ss and t6ss were considered to be a common feature of the atypical e. tarda, which is distinct from the typical strains. at the sequence level, the second t3ss was similar to the t3ss of e. coli, and the t6ss was similar to the t6sss in other enterobacteria, enterobacter and pantoea. to examine the locus structures in detail, we sequenced the genome of fpc <dig> using longer-read  <dig> pyrosequencing. de novo assembly produced a single contig for the t3ss locus, and two contigs for the t6ss which were further joined into a single contig by pcr-based genome walking. both contigs contained, at either end, the genes that were present in the e. tarda eib <dig> chromosome, implying that these contigs were derived from the fpc <dig> chromosome and not from the plasmids. we observed that homologs of intimin  <cit>  and tir   <cit>  were encoded in the t3ss cluster. these genes  are known to be important elements in a pathogenicity island of enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic e. coli strains, namely the locus of enterocyte effacement   <cit> . strikingly, when we compared the gene content and order between the fpc <dig> t3ss cluster and the e. coli lees, we found that they were well conserved . indeed,  <dig> out of  <dig> genes in enteropathogenic e. coli  were identified in the fpc <dig> t3ss locus, and the observed differences in the gene order were explainable by assuming a few recombination events. furthermore, we observed microsynteny in each of the five major operons , which constitute lee  <cit> . thus, we concluded that fpc <dig> had a lee-like pathogenicity island that we named et-lee . for the second t6ss, which we termed et-t6ss <dig>  we also observed a high synteny to a t6ss cluster in p. ananatis . in particular, we found a homolog of vgrg that encodes an effector protein of t6ss  <cit> . as reported in other enterobacterial genomes  <cit> , this gene is closely located to hcp, which was identified previously in e. tarda <cit> , suggesting that these genes may function as essential components of the et-t6ss <dig> in fpc <dig>  in the genome assembly of fpc <dig>  we found another contigs that were similar to the et-t6ss <dig> locus , implying that this locus was duplicated in fpc <dig> 

it is known that pathogenicity-related genes often flow among species by horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . using a markov model method, we predicted that et-lee was extrinsic to fpc <dig> through recent horizontal transfer. the t6ss locus was not significantly predicted by the method, but the genes may possibly be of the horizontal origin because the gene sequences were highly similar to the corresponding genes in pantoea  and no orthologs were present in other e. tarda strains. a difference between e. coli lee and et-lee is their locations in the genomes: e. coli lee was generally inserted next to a trna locus, but no trna locus was found close to et-lee. in addition, no transposable element related genes were detected near the et-lee, except for a member of the transposase is3/is <dig> family. therefore, we proposed that et-lee may either have lost mobility after integration or have been inserted in a different manner than e. coli lee.

our result raises a further question about why fpc <dig> acquired and retained et-lee. since, in e. coli, the secreted tir and intimin proteins encoded in lee function in adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> , et-lee may also play a role in the intimate attachment of the pathogen to fish intestinal cell. we should keep in mind that fpc <dig> is a non-motile strain , a trait that is disadvantageous for infection to host cells. thus, a plausible explanation for the acquisition of et-lee by fpc <dig> may be that et-lee can compensate for its non-motility: when fpc <dig> is carried close to the host intestinal cells, it can fix tightly and effectively colonize its host by using et-lee. the origin of lee in enterobacteria is also an unanswered question. lee has been reported in pathogenic e. coli, in a mouse-pathogen citrobacter rodentium <cit> , and in salmonella enterica <cit> , but, until now, it has not been reported in fish pathogens. the current study has shown that the e. tarda strain that infects red sea bream may have also acquired et-lee by horizontal transfer, meaning that the donor species of lee was not e. tarda. molecular phylogenetic analysis indicated that all the et-lee genes examined were significantly close to the lees of e. coli, c. rodentium and s. enterica , suggesting that et-lee may be an appropriate outgroup of these lees. the sequencing of other e. tarda strains that harbor et-lee  may fill a missing link in the evolution of pathogenesis associated with lee in enterobacteria.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we determined the genome sequences of eight strains of e. tarda using next-generation sequencing technology. the gc content, hierarchical clustering based on gene repertoire, and phylogenetic tree, all clearly showed differences between the fish-pathogenic and environmental e. tarda genome sequences. by comparing the genomes, we identified polymorphisms that were responsible for serotypes and for the pathogenesis of e. tarda. we found that o-antigen related genes were different among each of the serotype strains, and that fish-pathogenic e. tarda was characterized by having two types of secretion systems  and pilus assembly genes. we predicted that the lineage- and species-specific genes may have originated by horizontal transfer, perhaps providing e. tarda with important traits that could be used as strain-dependent drug targets in aquaculture. importantly, in this study, we found that the e. tarda strain that was isolated from red sea bream had t3ss  and t6ss  genes that were of horizontal origin from foreign organisms. this observation suggests that the previously proposed e. tarda genotype edwgi could be divided into two sub-genotypes, a typical one and an et-lee/t6ss2-bearing  one. this is the first report that a fish pathogen possesses lee, which is known in zoonotic pathogenic enterobacteria. this finding may provide a clue to the origin of the lee pathogenicity island. our results suggest that gene flow beyond species has a wide influence in the pathogenesis of enterobacteria.
