BACKGROUND
in this section, motif discovery is introduced, followed by the summarization of existing methods, and methods beyond the scope of this paper. motivations are then given and the paper layout is presented.

motif discovery
transcription factor binding sites  are small nucleotide fragments  in the cis-regulatory/intergenic regions in dna sequences. regulatory proteins, namely the transcription factors , bind in a sequence-specific manner to tfbss to activate or suppress gene transcription . therefore, tfbss are a critical component in gene regulation, and identification of tfbss is a central problem for understanding gene regulation in molecular biology.

the dna binding domain of a tf can recognize and bind to a collections of similar tfbss, from which a conserved pattern called motif can be obtained. based on this phenomenon, de novo motif discovery using computational methods have been proposed to identify and predict tfbss and their corresponding motifs. motif discovery provides significant insights into the understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation. it serves as an attractive alternative for providing pre-screening and prediction of unknown tfbs motifs to the expensive and laborious biological experiments such as dna footprinting  <cit>  and gel electrophoresis  <cit> . the recent technology of chromatin immunoprecipitation   <cit>  measures the binding of a particular tf to dna using microarray technology at low resolution in a high-throughput manner, and produces more reliable input data of co-regulated genes for motif discovery  <cit> .

existing methods
categorization
because the conservation of motifs is often degenerated due to tfbs mutations, the searching is difficult . extensive algorithms have been proposed for de novo motif discovery since the last decades. there are two major representations for tfbs motifs :  consensus representation and  matrix representation; and there are two main different searching paradigms:  enumeration methods and  stochastic searching  <cit> . they are briefly described as follows:

 consensus representation is based on discrete strings. a simple model is to minimize the mismatches between the consensus and the tfbs instances  <cit> .

 matrix representation is usually a position frequency matrix , or a position weight matrix , to show the quantitative frequencies or weights of nucleotides in the motif. representative evaluations for a motif matrix include information content   <cit> , maximum a posterior   <cit>  and the bayesian models  <cit>  .

an artificial example of motif discovery. it shows the sequences s, the sim a, the motif instances r, the pfm Θ and the background frequencies Θ <dig>  in sequences s, the nucleotides from the background are shown in lower case, while the nucleotides from the motif instances in upper case.

the searching techniques with respect to the two representations, are discussed below.

 enumeration methods are usually applied  <cit>  to the consensus representation, but they do not scale up for long widths. however, they are useful to provide candidates for further searching and evaluations  <cit> . weeder  <cit>  is one well-known representative in this category.

stochastic searching is usually applied to align tfbss and obtain the motif matrix for the matrix representation. typical techniques can be categorized into local searching  <cit>  and global searching, where the latter can be classified into  single-point and  multi-point or group-based searching. global searching is more likely to find the global optima compared with local searching. while gibbs sampling is popular in motif discovery tools: e.g. bioprospector  <cit> , alignace  <cit>  and motifsampler  <cit> ). its single-point nature requires numerous iterations to converge to the global optima, otherwise the performance may be affected significantly. alternatively, the multi-point global searching approach, the genetic algorithm  <cit> , has shown promising results in motif discovery  <cit> . there is great potential for them to be applied to more sophisticated models and provide multiple optimal motifs  <cit> .

methods beyond
methods out of the scope of this paper but worth introducing are briefly mentioned as follows: ensembles of multiple motif discovery programs have been recently shown to improve their performance  <cit> . however, modelling tfbs motifs is critically beneficial for better understanding and predicting novel motifs, and provides essential performance improvement for ensembles. as a result, we will focus on individual motif discovery methods in this paper.

incorporating additional information sources  <cit>  is another trend to improve the motif prediction accuracy. while extra requirements are needed for their success, the sequence-based motif discovery problem remains challenging  <cit>  and calls for our serious attention because generalization and improvement on the sequence-based methods will without doubt help the integrated approaches.

motivations
challenges
there still exist great challenges for de novo motif discovery algorithms to succeed. challenges mainly include  np hardness , width uncertainty and  multiple  motifs, of which the latter two demand for more focus.

•  np hardness: the most well-known challenge is the np hardness  <cit>  due to the unknown conservation degree, where extensive approaches have been proposed to achieve optimality under certain models, as surveyed in the last sub-sections.

•  width uncertainty: an often overlooked challenge in real-life problems is the uncertainty in the motif widths.

in real datasets, it is not easy to determine a single motif width  experimentally or  biologically.  experimental: annotated tfbss are often affected by limited experimental resolutions, and it is thus difficult to choose any single width to fit the tfbss before a motif can be discovered.  biological: the most conserved binding contacts are between the short binding core of the target tfbs and the binding domain of a tf. the binding core may be fixed-width . however, the short binding core may not provide enough binding affinity for its corresponding tf to recognize. instead, a tf contain flexible segments of polypeptide chain, and these flexible arms work together with the dna binding domain of the tf to add additional affinity  <cit> . the complication makes the effective width not easy to be fixed at a single value. for example, the tfbs widths vary in the familial binding cases of the zn2-cys <dig> motif  <cit> .

existing methods usually assume a known and fixed tfbs motif width or model a distribution around an expected width when there are uncertainties involved. the conservation contributed from different motif parts by varying the widths may be under-utilized in a single-width approach, and the so-called expected value may be misleading and biased. statistical significance to rank different widths, e.g. e-value  <cit> , is computational intensive and still only picks a single-value width at the end. in the illustrative example of a real motif with  <dig> lexa binding sites in figure  <dig>  if a single width is chosen, it may be  <dig> if only the stringent core part  is chosen; or it may be  <dig> if considering all columns . in the former case, the short motif may not be ranked higher than those non-tfbs frequent patterns happening by chance. in the latter case, since both highly and weakly conserved columns are evaluated equally, it may include additional false positives. on the contrary, modelling those uncertain bases with a range concept can better capture the different resolutions for assessing the motif signals, and thus potentially better describe the real tfbs motif.

•  multiple  motifs: another challenge which is not well handled is the overlapping nature of tfbss for different motifs because competitive binding exists amongst different tfs in the same regulatory region. current techniques used are mainly masking/erasing and implicit maintaining.

- masking/erasing: these techniques can only discover one motif in a single execution, and thus several executions are required for outputting multiple motifs. masking/erasing techniques also prohibits the subsequent discovery of the tfbss overlapped with those previously masked ones. however, in real cases, different kinds of tfbss may overlap with each other due to competitive binding of tfs.

- implicit maintaining: there are existing methods to sample different motifs simultaneously but with little or no mechanism to explicitly distinguish different solutions or flexibly control the overlapping degrees of tfbss. as a result, highly redundant motifs may be produced. if there are limited number of output solutions, redundant top-scored variant motifs will dominate and less-fit but different solutions will be missed. if non-redundant and different solutions need to be provided, a large output number has to be set and post-processing is required  <cit>  with additional costs.

therefore, it is desirable to discover multiple motifs more effectively and efficiently with certain flexible and explicit overlapping control.

paper layout
to overcome all these drawbacks of the existing de novo motif discovery algorithms, we propose the generalized model which presents a new angle to handle the variable motif widths to better reflects the biological uncertainty. then we present the meta-convergence framework to support multiple optimal solutions with flexible overlapping control using similarity tests. based on the generalized model and the framework, a new algorithm called galf-g is developed.

the rest of the paper is arranged as follows. the generalized model, the meta-convergence framework and the new algorithm galf-g are first given. extensive experimental results are reported, including single/multiple motif discovery problems with fixed-width/variable widths inputs. a large number of both synthetic and real benchmark datasets are used in the experiments. after the substantial analysis of the results, discussion and conclusive remarks are made. the detailed implementations of our algorithm are given in the last methods section.

RESULTS
in this section, we present the generalized model and the meta-convergence framework in detail, and propose the resulting galf-g algorithm.

the generalized motif model
to tackle the challenge raised from the uncertainty of motif widths, we propose a new generalized model by considering a width range of interest simultaneously. a range is more practical and suitable for real biological cases for two reasons:

• first, it is easier to define a rough range than a particular width. all widths within contribute accordingly to the motif solution, and thus it is less sensitive than a wrongly chosen single width.

• second, tfbss of a motif in reality vary in their widths and exhibit certain higher degrees of conservation compared to the non-site fragments . a range model can more appropriately capture the different conservation degrees than any single width.

assume the width input is r =  and |r| = wmax - wmin +  <dig>  and a candidate solution, i.e. a set of tfbss to form a motif, is defined as a, with the tfbs positions denoted by {pi}. the formal problem denotations and formulations are shown in the methods section: the proposed model and evaluation. the generalized model evaluates a based on the whole range r. an illustrative example is shown in figure  <dig>  the model or scoring function  for a fixed width wi is well established, e.g. a probabilistic model, denoted as p |wi), where p) is a part from the complete candidate solution a with respect to wi. the generalized model can then be formulated by summing them together as

   

for the most common case when there is no prior knowledge on which width is more likely to happen, wi can take a uniform distribution, i.e. p = 1/|r| for each wi. on the other hand, any prior distribution such as the poisson one used in bayesian models  <cit>  can be also adopted. for each wi-component where wmin ≤ wi <wmax, there are more than one choice and we only pick the component a by argmax|wi)) . the additional computational cost compared to a fixed width model is o, which is feasible since motif ranges  are usually short . the major difference of the generalized model from the previous ones is that all the widths from the input range r contribute to the solution score/fitness in the model, rather than choosing a certain single width by argmax|wi) p ), which has the risk of bias on a certain single value. if only one width is input, the generalized model reduces to one of the existing fixed-width models.

intuitively, the generalized model is a weighted sum of the probability of different widths from the range r. it is compatible with the existing probability models and is even applicable to non-probability models, as long as there is a consistent expression of p); here it refers to an evaluation function in general. we employ the fixed-width probabilistic model in our generalized model, which will be discussed in detail in the methods section.

the meta-convergence framework
for practitioners in molecular biology and medical research, it is desirable that multiple optimal candidate motifs can be provided concurrently for biological verification. due to the limitations of masking/erasing and implicit maintaining, it is desired to explicitly maintain different solutions with flexible  control efficiently. to address these issues, we propose a meta-convergence framework employing genetic algorithm  with the similarity test as the overlapping control.

 the similarity test is first introduced to fulfill flexible overlapping control over different motifs. positional information is considered since the generalized model involves a width range r of positions. in particular, to compare two candidate solutions/individuals aa and ab, the test calculates the relaxed hamming distance h between each pair of their aligned tfbs positions:  and  in sequence i,

   

where tol is the shift tolerance. the similarity test is passed, if

   

, where dr is defined as the difference ratio, m indicates the number of sequences, and st is the similarity threshold. when dr <st, aa and ab are considered to be similar, i.e. belong to the same motif kind. the intuitive settings of tol, st for different purposes, and how the test is applied are detailed and included in methods: meta-convergence framework details.

the similarity test proposed allows users to control the differences between the expected motifs in an easy and intuitive way. on the contrary, the other possible comparisons based on the pfm involve complicated cut-off which is not trivial to specify and counterintuitive for common users.

 meta-convergence, with the similarity test, monitors the convergence of different optimal solutions and adaptively controls the numbers of ga runs rather than using a relatively large fixed number of ga runs in previous works  <cit> . furthermore, only a small number of candidates are subject to the similarity test to compete for the multiple optimal motifs, compared with the other method  <cit>  that compares the whole population of solutions with non-trivial overhead. therefore, the efficiency can be significantly improved. more details can be found in methods: meta-convergence framework details.

galf-g
incorporating genetic algorithm with local filtering  with the generalized model and the meta-convergence framework, galf-g  is proposed to discover multiple optimal motifs with flexible overlapping control using the similarity test. to fit into the generalized model with range input, the operators in galf are extended accordingly and detailed in the methods section: galf-g implementations.

in the following section, we will report the results of galf-g tested on both synthetic and real benchmark datasets for various cases, namely fixed-width, variable width, for single motif  and multiple motifs  discoveries.

experiments
in this section, the summary of the experiments is introduced, and then the experimental results are reported and analyzed in corresponding categories. finally experiments concerning the efficiency of galf-g are presented.

experiment summary
first of all, the evaluation measurements are introduced here. for most experiments except the benchmark ones  <cit> , the measurements employed are the site level  ones: positive predictive value/precision sppv, sensitivity/recall ssn and f-score sf with shift restrictions, similar to  <cit> . the advantage is that they reflect both site level and part of the nucleotide level performances concisely. for the benchmark experiments, we have to follow their standard measurements which employ looser site level measurements but introduce additional nucleotide level  ppv  and sensitivity , as well as performance coefficient   <cit>  and correlation coefficient   <cit>  on both levels .

 single motif discovery experiments  were firstly performed to test the generalized model. galf-g was verified on the  <dig> synthetic datasets from  <cit> , and compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms with fixed-width inputs as a special/degenerative case. galf-g was then further tested on the  <dig> real datasets employed in game  <cit>  with both fixed-width  inputs and range  inputs relatively close to the true widths. the challenges raised by the eukaryotic benchmark  <cit>  are then addressed, where there is no dataset-specific prior knowledge on the motif widths and only single motif outputs  and compared.

 multiple motifs experiments  were then performed for two scenarios. in the first scenario, since multiple candidates are desirable for biological testing even for single motif discovery  <cit> , galf-g was tested and compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms on the  <dig> e. coli benchmark datasets  <cit> , without dataset-specific prior knowledge on the motif widths. in the second scenario, since it is also desirable to discover different real motifs simultaneously, galf-g, game and meme were tested on the real liver-specific dataset with multiple  motifs. investigating into the exceptional case of game's  <dig> datasets using galf-g with multiple motifs discovery, we discovered a putative motif not annotated in the dataset previously has been identified.

single fixed-width motif discovery on synthetic data
galf-g was first verified in the special cases of fixed-width single motif discovery  on the  <dig> synthetic datasets used to test galf-p in  <cit> , which had performed best for these fixed width cases. we compared galf-g with galf-p, game, meme, bioprospector , and biooptimizers based on meme and bioprospector. weeder was not compared because it cannot be run on the long-width  datasets due to its width limit of  <dig>  details on generating the datasets were provided in  <cit>  . the average f-scores sf on the site level for each scenario are presented in table  <dig>  with the best results shown in bold. the full table with precisions , recalls , including biooptimizer results , is shown in . galf-g and galf-p are in general the best among all scenarios, especially in the difficult scenarios . galf-g is slightly better than galf-p in the last  <dig> scenarios. to compare galf-g with another close competitor, meme, t-test was employed . galf-g is shown to be better than meme within the significance level  <dig>  in  <dig> out of the  <dig> scenarios with better sf, while meme shows no convincing significance of being better in the other  <dig> scenarios.

we do not expect great differences between galf-g and other algorithms here, because under the fixed-width cases the generalized model is similar to other models in representative power. the experiments demonstrate the search capability of galf-g is comparable to or better than the previous best galf-p on the synthetic datasets. the main reason is that they use similar effective searching techniques based on local filtering  <cit> . the results from the synthetic data can be interpreted intuitively with respect to searching difficulties, because their respective conservation degrees are explicitly generated. for variable-width  cases, the complicated nature of different conservation degrees of tfbss is not easy to model or evaluate with synthetic data, hence it is more appropriate to test different methods with substantial real datasets, and the experimental results are presented in the following sub-sections.

single motif discovery on real datasets
in this sub-section, galf-g was evaluated and compared with other methods on the  <dig> real datasets used to test game  <cit> , for both fixed and variable widths cases in single motif discovery .

information of the  <dig> datasets is shown in table  <dig>  the crp dataset contains the binding sites for cyclic amp receptor, and has been widely tested since  <cit>  was published. the ere dataset contains the binding sites for the ligand-activated enhancer protein estrogen receptor   <cit> . the e2f datsets correspond to tfbss of the e2f family from mammalian sequences  <cit> . creb, mef <dig>  myod, srf and tbp are chosen from the abs database of annotated regulatory binding sites  <cit> . more details of the datasets can be found in  <cit> .

summary of the  <dig> real datasets. n is the number of sequences, l is the sequence length, wtrue is the motif width, and #t is the number of tfbss embedded.

the comparison studies for fixed and variable widths cases are given as follows:

 fixed-width single motif discovery  experiments were performed, where galf-p was previously tested and compared with game in a fixed-width manner. galf-g shows comparable overall f-scores sf  to the best average results from galf-p  and is better than game  by 33% on average from  <dig> runs. while galf-p shows significantly smaller variations than game in the performance  <cit> , galf-g shows even more stable and robust performance than galf-p, which is discussed further in the efficiency experiments.

we have also tried weeder  <cit>  on part of the datasets because weeder can only handle widths  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  weeder is optimized for several width range modes  <cit>  rather than fixed widths and will be formally compared in the following range experiments. for the fixed-width experiments, only creb, myod, srf and tbp were tested. the averaged sppv, ssn and sf of weeder for the  <dig> datasets are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. on the other hand, galf-g is better where the corresponding values are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> .

similar to the conclusion on fixed-width synthetic experiments, galf-g demonstrates competitive searching capacity on the fixed-width real data experiments, while galf-g makes a looser assumption.

  variable-width  experiments were performed, where galf-g was compared with game, meme, weeder, and flexmodule from cisgenome  <cit>  on the previous  <dig> real datasets. the additional flexmodule is a gibbs sampling  <cit>  motif discovery module implemented in the recent integrated system cisgenome  <cit>  for analyzing transcriptional regulation.

for each dataset,  <dig> different width ranges were input for testing where

   

each range represented variations of ±  <dig> bp on the width wi while the lower bound for wmin was set to  <dig> because it is rare for a motif width being smaller than  <dig>  with increasing i, wi = wtrue +  reflects larger divergence of shift from the biological truth wtrue . the average results of executing each program  <dig> times are shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  weeder is deterministic, and meme performs constantly in different runs for a same dataset , so there are no standard deviations shown for them.

average results , recall  and f-scores  are averaged separately) of galf-g and game on the  <dig> datasets. each range ri =  in general indicates different shifts i from the true width w. ± shows the standard deviation . the results with best sf among this table and table  <dig> are shown in bold.

average results of meme, weeder and flexmodule in the same comparison experiments described in table  <dig>  weeder was run with the width mode  that are closest to the ranges r for each dataset.

in most cases  galf-g achieves the best f-scores sf on the site level, as well as the average sppv, ssn and sf averaged on all the cases. the overall f-score of galf-g is 19% better than game, 14% better than meme, 85% better than weeder, and 21% better than flexmodule. the standard deviations of galf-g are also lower than game and flexmodule in most cases. the t-test on sf shows that galf-g is better than meme in  <dig> cases within significance level  <dig> , and in  <dig> case within significance level  <dig> , while meme is better in  <dig> cases within level  <dig> . it should be noted that galf-g significantly outperforms the other algorithms in ssn, probably because the generalized model not only predicts motifs as precise as the other models, but also accepts more correct tfbss based on a wider range than single widths.

the above experiments demonstrate that with a range relatively close to the true widths, galf-g with the generalized model shows favorable performance even compared with the results based on e-values. in fact, the performance with the input width ranges close to the true widths is comparable to that with fixed-width inputs, except for the myod dataset. the exceptional case of myod will be investigated separately and shown containing multiple motifs later.

to summarize, on the  <dig> real datasets for single motif discovery, galf-g demonstrates competitive performance in fixed-width experiments, and provides obvious improvement over other methods in variable-width  experiments. for the cases without much prior information on the exact widths, experiments will be described in the next sub-sections.

single motif discovery challenges on eukaryotic benchmarks
the recent well-known eukaryotic benchmark by tompa et al  <cit>  imposes great challenges to motif discovery algorithms. the problems of tompa et al benchmark include the insufficient signals  and inappropriate evaluation methods  . it has been indicated that many motifs in the tompa et al benchmark are not able to be discriminated by common motif models from remaining sequence  <cit> . an improved benchmark  <cit>  has thus been proposed for being more suitable to evaluate motif discovery algorithms. the algorithm benchmark suite  <cit>  extracts motifs from transfac and includes representative eukaryotic species. there are  <dig> datasets with backgrounds generated by markov models and  <dig> with real cis-regulatory region backgrounds. the widths are not given in the benchmark and thus a uniform width range input has to be set for all experiments. the additional evaluation measure corresponding to this benchmark is the nucleotide level correlation coefficient   <cit> .

galf-g was tested on the corresponding algorithm benchmark suite  <cit>  and compared with meme and weeder, the two most widely used algorithms . the average results of nsn, nppv, npc and ncc are shown in table  <dig>  for markov backgrounds, galf-g is 31% better than meme, 214% than weeder in npc, and 42% better than meme, 165% than weeder in ncc. similar conclusions can be drawn for the real backgrounds. it should be noted that while meme and weeder perform poorly in one of the two backgrounds, galf-g maintains the competitive performance well in both.

average performances  of galf-g, meme and weeder on the algorithm benchmark suite .

in the improved eukaryotic benchmark  <cit> , which is considered more suitable to test motif discovery algorithms, galf-g shows superior performance to the widely-used meme and weeder, while only top-scored motifs are compared. however, as stated in  <cit> , it is more meaningful in practice to provide multiple motifs for testing  <cit>  where the experiments are reported as following.

multiple motifs outputs on the e. coli benchmark
in this sub-section, galf-g was tested, to address a more realistic scenario, where multiple candidate motifs are desired for identifying the true tfbss in biological research, on the e. coli benchmark. the e. coli benchmark ecrdb62a  <cit>  has  <dig> datasets, on average about  <dig> bp in the sequence length varying from  <dig> to  <dig> bp,  <dig> sequences per dataset, around  <dig>  sites per sequence and the average site width is  <dig>  with standard deviation >  <dig>  which indicates very diversified widths.

specifically, minimal parameter-tuning policy was employed as if the programs were run by a common user with minimum prior knowledge in practice. results of alignace  <cit> , bioprospector  <cit> , mdscan  <cit> , meme  <cit> , motifsampler  <cit>  and weeder  <cit>  were obtained for comparison. a uniform width of  <dig> was input for those fixed-width algorithms, namely alignace, bioprospector, mdscan and motifsampler. on the other hand, meme was run with the default setting for widths and the optimal one was chosen automatically within. weeder was run with the large width mode. for galf-g, we ran it on the benchmark datasets with both the uniform fixed width  <dig> and also the widest range accepted for the program of r =  <cit>  with |r| =  <dig> around the central width  <dig>  for all algorithms,  <dig> motifs were output for detailed comparisons.

we employ the evaluation criteria from  <cit> , namely precision ppv, sensitivity sn, performance coefficient pc and f-score f, on both nucleotide  and site  levels  . in the comparisons shown in table  <dig>  the accuracy of the best prediction out of the top  <dig> scoring predictions is evaluated with respect to npc. with both fixed-width and range inputs, galf-g outperforms the other algorithms in all evaluation criteria. for example, galf-g  outperforms the best among the other algorithms by 49% in npc, 29% in nf, 28% in spc and 18% in sf. galf-g , with width range input  <cit> , outperforms the other best algorithms by 46% in npc, 29% in nf, 25% in spc and 24% in sf. by comparing the two different input settings for galf-g we can see that with little sacrifice in other measures , the generalized model based on the range  demonstrates improved site level sensitivity, in particular 15%  in ssn compared with galf-g  and 34%  compared with the best among other algorithms.

 prediction accuracy on the ecrdb62a benchmark of e. coli at nucleotide, binding site levels. galf-g  was run with the fixed width  <dig> and galf-g  was run with the range  <cit> . the best results are bold.

besides the best predictions out of the  <dig> outputs, investigation was also done to analyze the top-scored motifs as well as the rest individually for different algorithms. the statistics in terms of npc, which reflects both nppv and nsn, are shown in table  <dig>  as indicated before in  <cit> , the top-scored predictions are not necessarily the best predictions, implying that outputting only a single prediction may not be a good choice in practice or for comparison studies. however, the top-scored predictions from galf-g are significantly better than the best among the other algorithms, by 30%  and 36%  respectively. we can also see that, for galf-g, the generalized model based on the range provides better performance than on the fixed width, with respect to both the top-scored and the mean predictions. this implies that the generalized model using ranges is useful when the prior width information is usually not strong in practice. on this benchmark for multiple motif outputs, galf-g outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms considerably. the generalized model exhibits improved sensitivity while maintaining competitive precision, and thus achieves better overall performance on the site level.

multiple motif types in real datasets
in gene regulation, tfbss of different kinds of motifs may appear in the same promoter region. they either work together to regulate the transcription or compete for the tf binding when part of the tfbss overlap with each other. thus it is meaningful to discovery multiple tfbs motifs, possibly with overlaps in some of their tfbss, from a dataset simultaneously. the following experiments tested galf-g under the corresponding scenario.

the liver-specific dataset
the liver-specific dataset  <cit>  contains  <dig> sequences, embedded with several major motifs  varying in widths, namely hnf- <dig>  hnf- <dig>  hnf- <dig> and c/ebp, and some other motifs with fewer sites, such as cre, brf- <dig> and brf- <dig> with only one occurrence for each of them. some tfbss from different types of motifs overlap with each other in the dataset. for example, a tfbs of hnf- <dig>  overlaps with a tfbs of hnf- <dig>  with  <dig> bp in a particular sequence, while co-occurring tfbss of hnf- <dig> and hnf- <dig> in some other sequences do not overlap at all. the total number of  tfbs instances is  <dig>  the widths vary dramatically from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp.

on this dataset, galf-g, game and meme were compared using the width range input r =  <cit> , which is considered a common range for tfbss, to discover different types of motifs. the expected width for game was  <dig>  the mean of the input range. different numbers of motifs, k, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> with step  <dig>  were output and evaluated.

the site level  results of sppv, ssn and f-scores sf  based on all tfbss are shown in figure  <dig> for different k. meme fails to produce comparable recalls or f-scores to the others. it is probably caused by the masking techniques not allowing overlapping of motifs. game masks tfbss individually rather than the whole motifs, so better ssn  can be obtained from a diverse ga population. with overlapping control on the ga, galf-g shows recalls comparable to or better than game. moreover, galf-g has the best sppv  while game generally has the worst. both galf-g and meme show an increasing trend of recalls as k increases. the sudden drop of game for k =  <dig> is probably because the expected width no longer suits some of the motifs while game actually performs fixed-width search in its ga. galf-g provides the best balance between precisions and sensitivities, and thus gives the best f-scores in all cases. averaged on all k, the f-scores are: galf-g:  <dig> , game:  <dig>  and meme:  <dig>  where galf-g outperforms the other two by 20% and 73% respectively.

besides the previous evaluation that treats all the tfbss as a whole, type specific investigation was also carried out on the output results of galf-g. with the help of stamp  <cit> , the predicted motifs with k =  <dig> galf-g were searched for matches of annotated tfbs motifs from the transfac database v <dig> , based on allr . allr was considered to be the most effective in comparisons of single columns for motifs  <cit> .

the relevant matches for the top  <dig> motifs are displayed in sequence logo formats in figure  <dig>  the top  <dig> high-scored motifs, labeled in stamp by motif  and motif v <dig> , match hnf- <dig> and hnf- <dig> in transfac respectively with high statistical significance, i.e., low e-values . for motif v <dig> , it matches part of hnf- <dig> alpha without high statistical significance , because only part of the hnf- <dig> tfbss are identified in the predicted motif. it indicates that, top-scored motifs output by galf-g in general match true tfbs motifs with high confidence. the other two motifs do not have relevant top  <dig> matches in transfac. c/ebp cannot be discovered as a whole motif, possibly due to its low conservation compared to the hnf motifs. stamp also provides the phylogenetic profile where motif  and motif v <dig>  are grouped together, and so is motif v <dig> , implying they belong to the same hnf family. for k =  <dig>  similar results are obtained, with matches mainly including hnf- <dig> and hnf- <dig> 

in-depth investigation on the myod dataset
the myod dataset seems to be an exceptional case among the  <dig> real datasets tested by game  <cit> . only galf-g  and galf-p  are able to show acceptable site level results  in the fixed-width  experiments, while in the variable width experiments none of the programs succeed in providing good results.

to investigate into this exception, galf-g was set to output k =  <dig> different motifs with the annotated width  <dig>  besides the fittest output being the annotated myod motif, the other two are only marginally lower in their fitness compared to the best one . that is probably the reason why most existing algorithms perform poorly in this dataset - they either locate a sub-optimal because of the low signal-to-noise ratio, or obtain inappropriate rankings of the motifs due to the subtle differences in the modelling. it indicates that the accurate width information is still crucial for such subtle and short motifs. we searched the 2nd ranked motif, motif v <dig>  for matches from the transfac database using stamp, based on the various column comparison metrics provided by stamp. consistent matches, such as e2a  <cit> , p <dig>  <cit> , e <dig>  <cit>  and e-box  <cit>  motifs, were obtained with high rankings , and these motifs are closely related to myod for muscle cell regulation according to the references  <cit> . the most consistent matches are shown in figure  <dig>  thus there is a high probability that motif v <dig> is a true motif which may not have been annotated previously in the myod dataset. in summary, galf-g outperforms game and meme by 14% and 73% on average in sf respectively on the liver-specific dataset for multiple motifs discovery. additionally, galf-g sheds light to an additional motif which may not have been annotated previously in the myod dataset.

efficiency experiments
although the effectiveness is the major concern for motif discovery, practitioners also prefer efficient algorithms which have capability for large scale data. in this sub-section, we tested galf-g with different ga population sizes to investigate the trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency of meta-convergence. firstly, different population sizes ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  10) were used to run galf-g, galf-p and game  on the  <dig> real datasets  <cit>  for fixed-width single motif discovery. for each ps, they were run  <dig> times on the same pentium d  <dig>  ghz machine with  <dig> gb memory, running windows xp, and the results were averaged. the effectiveness  and efficiency are shown in figures  <dig>  to  <dig> . for the default ps =  <dig>  the average time  follows that: galf-g  < galf-p  < game . since the standard deviation of game's effectiveness is already large with ps =  <dig>  we only focus on galf-g and galf-p to compare the effects  of different ps. in figure  <dig> , the overall performance for ps =  <dig> are similar, as well as the standard deviations: galf-g  <dig> ; galf-p  <dig> . however, when the population size drops to ps =  <dig>  the performance of galf-p drops significantly, and the standard deviation becomes  <dig>  on average, and even ≥  <dig>  for mef <dig> and tbp datasets ). on the contrary, the average performance of galf-g is maintained, and the overall standard deviation is only  <dig> , still a very small number. furthermore, the average time of galf-g for ps =  <dig> is just  <dig>  seconds, which is over  <dig> times speedup of the default ps, as shown in figure  <dig> .

it is interesting that even with a population size of  <dig>  galf-g still performs comparably well, while galf-p degenerates significantly. the major reason is due to the meta-convergence framework with similarity test, which is not used in galf-p. with an extremely small population, galf may not be able to provide the optimal motif in every run. however, since different motifs are controlled and maintained on a meta level in galf-g, converged sub-optimal motifs will be replaced by better ones and eventually the global optimum can be found.

the above results imply that, galf-g is able to provide comparable and consistent performance for fixed-width single motif discovery with a small population for competitive efficiency.

on the e. coli benchmark for multiple outputs  with range inputs, we observed similar performance maintenance with different ps for galf-g in figure  <dig> , thanks to the meta-convergence mechanism to maintain different optimal motifs in the solutions. the average time on each dataset for the three ps is  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   seconds respectively, where the ps =  <dig> demonstrates a speedup of over  <dig> times compared to that of the default size . for ps =  <dig>  the standard deviation of npc is  <dig> , which is still small compared with  <dig>  for the default ps.

according to the efficiency experiments, galf-g is able to maintain competitive effectiveness with very high efficiency. therefore galf-g has great potential to work on ever larger scale datasets successfully.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
to conclude, we summarize the proposed work of galf-g, discuss about the challenges and point out future directions.

summary
in this paper, the generalized motif model is proposed for realistic motif discovery problems. it models a possible range of widths rather than any single width. the model has the potential to address the biological uncertainty better and is more practical in reality because tfbss of the same motif may vary in widths and exhibit different degrees of conservation. the meta-convergence framework is proposed to support multiple and possibly overlapping optimal motifs, based on the flexible and easy control of the similarity test for users. galf-g is developed by incorporating the extended galf searching methodology into the meta-convergence framework based on the generalized model.

galf-g has been tested extensively on over  <dig> datasets, including  <dig> synthetic datasets,  <dig> real datasets ,  <dig> eukaryotic and  <dig> e. coli benchmark datasets, as well as a real liver-specific dataset with multiple overlapping motifs. galf-g has shown its competitiveness and better effectiveness for different kinds of motif discovery problems with both fixed-width and range inputs. the generalized model not only predicts the motifs accurately but also include more correct tfbss. the searching capacity for optimal solutions and efficiency of the meta-convergence framework have also been demonstrated with the synthetic and real datasets. galf-g has also discovered an additional motif which might not have been annotated previously in the myod dataset.

discussion
however, the motif discovery problem remains challenging due to the weak underlying motif signals input data, as well as the diversity and complexity of tf binding tfbss  <cit> . there are also a number of potential improvements for the generalized motif model and galf-g in our future work, such as further analysis on the effect of different width ranges, more efficient evaluation when handling different width fragments, flexible width distributions for different motif types, validation of the putative motif in myod dataset, etc. the candidate fixed-width model for the generalized model still needs more investigation to better suit the biological observation. integrating the generalized model for motif discovery with additional evidence such as expression data to increase the prediction power is another attractive research direction to us.
