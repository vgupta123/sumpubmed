BACKGROUND
venomous snakes rely almost entirely on their complex, largely proteinaceous venoms for feeding and defense, resulting in strong selective pressures on the genes encoding venom components  <cit>  and on the ultimate repositories of the venoms, the snakes’ prey  <cit>  and predators  <cit> . although molecular signals of positive selection have been repeatedly documented for individual venom components through sequence comparisons across species  <cit> , such analyses characterize only minute portions of the full evolutionary stories of venoms. proteomic approaches  <cit>  can characterize full-venom patterns of divergence between species  <cit> , but only in broad strokes, failing to differentiate members of large venom-gene families and to provide information on sequence divergence. even the most complex venoms are simple in terms of the number of gene families or toxin classes present; the hundreds of proteins  <cit>  typically belong to less than  <dig> gene families. proteomic approaches therefore average out many of the details of venom evolution. venom-gland transcriptomics  <cit>  have the unrealized potential to combine many, but certainly not all, of the benefits of both approaches. with adequate sequencing effort, transcriptomes can provide the full-venom information of proteomics approaches as well as the information-dense gene sequences for molecular-evolutionary analyses  <cit> , although post-transcriptional regulation could lead to significant discrepancies between venom content and expressed toxin mrnas  <cit> .

snake-venom composition can vary significantly between species  <cit> , within and between populations of a single species  <cit> , and even ontogenetically within an individual  <cit> . this variation is related, at least in part, to differences in diets  <cit> . some general, recurrent patterns have been identified within this extensive variation, including the type i/ii rattlesnake-venom classification described by mackessy  <cit> , which emphasizes the inverse relationship between toxicity and metalloproteinase activity seen in many rattlesnake venoms. snake-venom metalloproteinases  are enzymes that break down components of the capillary basement membrane, resulting in local and systemic hemorrhage. svmps are more generally known to disrupt hemostasis and cause inflammation and apoptosis  <cit> . type i venoms have high metalloproteinase activity and high ld <dig> values , whereas type ii venoms have low metalloproteinase activity and low ld <dig> values . high metalloproteinase activity and high toxicity appear to be incompatible properties of rattlesnake venoms  <cit> . type i venoms are by far the most prevalent of the two venom types, appearing in  <dig> out of  <dig> rattlesnake taxa examined by mackessy  <cit> . mackessy  <cit>  also revealed that different subspecies can have different venom types. for example, the massasauga  expresses type i venom in some subspecies  and type ii in others . other studies have shown ontogenetic shifts between venom types, with juveniles expressing type ii venom but switching to type i as adults  <cit> . some species, such as c. durissus, are known to express type ii venom as both juveniles and adults, a pattern hypothesized to represent paedomorphism  <cit> . despite the major differences in pharmacology and composition between these two venom types, evolutionary transitions between them appear to be common and to occur in parallel in several different species and perhaps even in different populations of the same species, despite the relatively short time  since crotalus diverged from sistrurus <cit> . the selective pressures favoring these transitions, the events triggering or enabling them, and the precise nature of any expression or genetic changes resulting in the altered venom properties are unknown. the determination of these unknowns not only has implications for our understanding of the evolution of major phenotypic innovations, but also has practical implications for snakebite treatment. although type ii venoms are the minority, bites from snakes with type ii venoms show drastically different pathologies that might require unique treatment approaches.

the eastern diamondback rattlesnake  and the timber rattlesnake  are among the largest rattlesnake species, capable of reaching lengths of  <dig>  m and  <dig>  m, respectively  <cit> . crotalus horridus occurs from new england and extreme southern ontario, southward to northern florida, and westward to eastern texas and extreme southeastern minnesota  <cit> . crotalus adamanteus is a species of the southeastern coastal plain, ranging from extreme southeastern north carolina, southward to the florida keys, and westward along the coast to extreme eastern louisiana, and is also common on many of the atlantic and gulf barrier islands  <cit> . the two species are sympatric in parts of the carolinas, georgia, northern florida, alabama, mississippi, and louisiana, although they appear to be partitioned by habitat preference. crotalus adamanteus is more often encountered in areas of high, dry, sandy soils, and c. horridus is more often found in low, wet bottomlands  <cit> . both species are of conservation concern because of habitat loss and human persecution  <cit> . crotalus horridus has been extirpated from many areas, particularly in the northern part of its range, and is classified as endangered in six states and threatened in five others. crotalus adamanteus is listed as endangered in north carolina and is currently being reviewed for federally threatened status under the endangered species act. the diets of both species are similar, consisting primarily of rabbits, squirrels, rats, mice, and occasionally birds, with rabbits being more commonly consumed by the larger c. adamanteus <cit> . crotalus horridus also occasionally consumes frogs and snakes  <cit> . despite their similarities in size and diet, the venoms from some populations of the two species show dramatic differences in pharmacological properties, composition, and toxicity. crotalus adamanteus and most populations of c. horridus express type i venom  <cit> , but at least two distinct, southern populations of c. horridus express venoms consistent with a type ii classification  <cit> .

straight and glenn  <cit>  isolated an extremely lethal, heterodimeric phospholipase a <dig>  presynaptic neurotoxin from c. horridus, which was homologous to mojave toxin from c. scutulatus <cit>  and crotoxin from c. durissus terrificus <cit> . related toxins have also been found in c. helleri <cit> , c. tigris <cit> , neonates of c. simus <cit> , and rattlesnakes in the genus sistrurus <cit> . the c. horridus toxin was named canebrake toxin because it was discovered from a northern-florida specimen belonging to the former subspecies c. h. atricaudatus, known colloquially as the canebrake rattlesnake. glenn et al.  <cit>  further characterized this neurotoxin, examined its geographic distribution, and found a complex pattern of venom composition in relation to the presence/absence of canebrake toxin and hemorrhagic activity. crotalus horridus individuals fall into one of four venom types: type a venoms have canebrake toxin but no hemorrhagic activity, type b venoms lack canebrake toxin but have hemorrhagic activity, type a+b venoms have both canebrake toxin and hemorrhagic activity, and type c venoms have neither canebrake toxin nor hemorrhagic activity. types a and b appear to be the most common types, suggesting a strong inverse relationship in venom composition between canebrake toxin and toxins such as svmps, which are major contributors to tissue damage and hemorrhage. type b venom dominates throughout most of the range of c. horridus with only two known, disjunct regions where type a is common, one of which  falls in one of the regions of sympatry with c. adamanteus. type a venom would be considered a type ii rattlesnake venom under mackessy’s classification, whereas type b would be a type i  <cit> . in terms of ld <dig> in mice, the order of decreasing toxicity for these venom types is: a > a+b > b > c. analogous venom types, excluding type c, have been identified in c. scutulatus <cit>  and c. helleri <cit>  in relation to the presence or absence of mojave toxin. these venom types, in particular types a and b, reflect vastly different prey incapacitation strategies and possibly different feeding ecologies, because types a and c lack predigestive effects. low hemorrhagic activity could limit the maximum size of prey that can be consumed or prevent effective digestion at suboptimal temperatures, thereby inducing altitudinal, geographical, or seasonal limitations on foraging  <cit> .

the venom-gland transcriptome of c. adamanteus from northern florida has been extensively characterized by means of  <dig> pyrosequencing  <cit>  and illumina sequencing  <cit> , and this species’ venom is clearly type i on the basis of its biochemical properties, ld <dig> <cit> , and expressed venom genes  <cit> . the most abundant transcript in its venom gland encoded a myotoxin-a , and svmps were the most abundant toxin class  <cit> . to compare venom-gland expression patterns between a rattlesnake with type i venom and one with type ii and to elucidate the evolutionary genesis of these venom types, we sequenced the venom-gland transcriptome of c. horridus from northern florida by means of illumina technology, following the sequencing and de novo assembly approach used for c. adamanteus <cit> . we provide the first comprehensive, sequence-based comparison of venoms between two closely related snake species and the first in-depth examination of toxin gene-family evolution, expression, and reorganization resulting from recent species divergence. we generated the first genome-scale analysis of snake molecular evolution on the basis of thousands of newly annotated nontoxins and compared the evolution of toxin sequences to these nontoxin sequences to determine whether toxins are unique in their evolutionary patterns. while a comparison between the venom-gland transcriptomes of the two venom types in c. horridus might have provided a more precise comparison of expression patterns underlying the two venom types, such a comparison would provide substantially less data on toxin and nontoxin molecular evolution and on patterns of gene-family evolution in snake venoms. by comparing the venom-gland transcriptomes of c. horridus and c. adamanteus, we provide the first transcriptome-based comparison between type i and type ii rattlesnake venoms and the first genome-scale characterization of molecular divergence between two closely related venomous snake species.

RESULTS
crotalus horridus venom-gland transcriptome sequencing and assembly
we generated a total of  <dig> , <dig> pairs of 100-nucleotide  raw reads, and  <dig> , <dig> pairs passed the illumina quality filter. we merged  <dig> , <dig> pairs into high-quality composite reads on the basis of their 3’ overlaps as described by rokyta et al.  <cit>  and rodrigue et al.  <cit> . these composite reads had average lengths of  <dig> nt with average phred scores of  <dig> and were the only reads used for assembly. although we could have simply aligned our c. horridus sequencing reads to the transcripts previously identified for c. adamanteus, we performed an independent de novo assembly to provide confirmation of the c. adamanteus annotations, increase the total number of gene sequences identified for the genus crotalus, and avoid propagating any errors that might be present in the c. adamanteus assembly. we followed the iterative assembly approach of rokyta et al.  <cit> . we began by running the extender program described by rokyta et al.  <cit>  on a set of  <dig>  random reads to identify any extremely high-abundance transcripts. this procedure resulted in  <dig> contigs,  <dig> of which had full-length coding sequences. after eliminating duplicates, we had  <dig> nontoxins and  <dig> toxins. the high number of duplicates was indicative of extremely biased expression in the venom glands. with these  <dig> transcripts, we filtered ∼37% of the original reads and performed a de novo assembly with ngen on  <dig> million of the unfiltered reads. this assembly produced  <dig>  contigs from which we annotated  <dig> full-length toxin and  <dig>  full-length nontoxin transcripts. these  <dig>  transcripts were used to filter ∼30% of the previously unfiltered reads, and  <dig> million of the remaining reads were used in a second de novo ngen assembly. this assembly produced  <dig>  contigs, and we annotated  <dig> full-length toxin and  <dig>  full-length nontoxin transcripts from these contigs. these  <dig>  transcripts were used in a third and final filtering step, removing ∼12% of the reads from the previous set, and  <dig> million of the unfiltered reads were used in a final de novo ngen assembly. of the resulting  <dig>  contigs,  <dig> were annotated as full-length toxins and  <dig> as full-length nontoxins. after eliminating duplicates, our procedure generated  <dig>  unique, full-length nontoxin coding sequences and  <dig> unique, full-length putative-toxin coding sequences.

our  <dig>  full-length, annotated nontoxin sequences accounted for  <dig> % of the total sequencing reads, and our  <dig> toxin transcripts accounted for an additional  <dig> %, illustrating clearly the extreme specialization of the venom gland. we were able to account for  <dig> % of the sequencing reads . these percentages were similar to those of rokyta et al.  <cit>  who used the same overall sequencing and assembly approach for c. adamanteus . our  <dig>  annotated sequences  represent substantial fractions of the genes encoded by these rattlesnakes’ genomes; for comparison,  <dig>  protein-coding genes were annotated from a full-genome assembly of the green anole lizard anolis carolinensis <cit> . the sequences generated in the present work and by rokyta et al.  <cit>  should facilitate genome sequencing and annotation for viperid snakes.

in all that follows, we used the percentage of reads mapping to a given transcript as a proxy for its expression level. this approach was used by rokyta et al.  <cit>  for c. adamanteus, against whose results we will be making extensive comparisons, and matches the measures used in the many sanger-sequencing-based venom-gland transcriptomic studies for snakes  <cit> . a measure such as average coverage might help correct for any correlation between the number of reads mapping to a transcript and its length, but our data showed no significant relationship between these two values . the measures of reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads   <cit>  or fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads  for paired-end reads  <cit>  offer normalization for coding-rna length and the total number of reads, providing an analog of the relative molar concentrations of transcripts. note that our sequences, being processed mrnas, lack introns, and this normalization for coding length is therefore less critical. more sophisticated normalization approaches have also been described  <cit>  for rna-seq data, but the optimal measure of transcript abundance remains under debate  <cit>  and depends on the purpose and nature of the analyses. generally, we were concerned with how transcriptional effort is apportioned among transcripts, which makes percentages a natural measure. in addition, percentages yield a form of compositional data  <cit> , which has well-studied properties that enable natural comparisons among subsets. such an approach is natural for gene-expression data  <cit> .

type ii crotalus horridus toxin-gene expression patterns
some of the  <dig> toxin sequences were similar enough to potentially confound estimates of their individual abundances, so for the purpose of estimating transcript abundances, we clustered these sequences whenever they showed less than 1% nt divergence in their coding sequences. the clustering threshold of 1% is arbitrary but matches the approach used by rokyta et al.  <cit>  for c. adamanteus. our average composite-read lengths of  <dig> nt and a minimum nt divergence of 1% ensure that reads can generally be mapped uniquely to contigs. clustering the original  <dig> toxin sequences resulted in  <dig> toxin clusters . in all clusters, the mutations responsible for the differences between the sequences were at substantial frequencies  with high coverage, suggesting that these sequences were either alleles or recent duplicates rather than simply sequencing errors. toxins were named by a toxin-class abbreviation, a number designating the cluster , and a lower-case letter . where necessary to differentiate between species, we preceded toxin names with “cadam” to indicate those sequences identified in the c. adamanteus transcriptome and “chorr” to indicate those sequences identified in the c. horridus transcriptome.

toxin sequences were vastly overrepresented in the venom-gland transcriptome of c. horridus , accounting for  <dig> % of the total reads . the seven most highly expressed genes were toxins, as were  <dig> of the  <dig> most highly expressed genes. of the  <dig> most highly expressed genes,  <dig> were toxins . as has been noted previously for other species  <cit> , the venom gland of c. horridus is highly specialized for the production of toxic proteins.

the venom of c. horridus, in terms of gene expression, was dominated by three classes of toxin: snake-venom serine proteinases , pla2s, and bradykinin-potentiating and c-type natriuretic peptides . these three toxin classes accounted for  <dig> % of the reads mapping to toxin sequences. the  <dig> clusters of svsps accounted for  <dig> % of the toxin-encoding reads. these enzymatic venom components show highly variable substrate specificities but generally catalyze reactions that disrupt hemostatic mechanisms, including the coagulation cascade and the kallikrein-kinin, fibrinolytic, and complement systems  <cit> . the nine clusters of pla2s accounted for  <dig> % of the toxin reads. pla2s show an astounding array of toxic functions, including neurotoxic, cardiotoxic, myotoxic, hemolytic, convulsive, anticoagulant, antiplatelet, edema-inducing, and tissue-damaging effects  <cit> . crotalus horridus from the geographic region from which our animal was collected are known to express an extremely potent, heterodimeric, presynaptic β-neurotoxin known as canebrake toxin  <cit> , which is homologous to the notoriously lethal mojave toxin of c. scutulatus and crotoxin of c. durissus terrificus. these toxins comprise two noncovalently associated subunits, both of which are derived from pla <dig> paralogs. the basic subunit is weakly toxic on its own and shows pla <dig> activity. the acidic subunit is nontoxic alone and consists of three disulfide-linked polypeptide chains proteolytically derived from a pla2-like precursor. the two most abundant pla <dig> transcripts in the c. horridus venom-gland transcriptome, pla2- <dig> and pla2-1a, are most likely the basic and acidic chains of the canebrake toxin and account together for  <dig> % of the toxin reads . pla2- <dig> is  <dig> % divergent at the nt level and  <dig> % divergent at the amino-acid level from the crotoxin basic subunit . pla2-1a is  <dig> % divergent at the nt level and  <dig> % divergent at the amino-acid level from the crotoxin acidic subunit . crotalus horridus actually appeared to express four paralogous versions of the acidic subunit, including pla2-1a, pla2- <dig>  pla2- <dig>  and pla2- <dig> . the single bpp cluster in the c. horridus venom gland accounts for  <dig> % of the toxin reads. these toxins are noted for lowering blood pressure in bite victims  <cit> . together, these three major classes of toxins in high abundance suggest a unique viperid bite pathology consisting of coagulopathic, hypotensive, and neurotoxic effects.

major classes typical of viperid venoms are notably at extremely low abundances in the c. horridus venom . we detected only three clusters of svmps, which accounted for just  <dig> % of the toxin reads. these venom enzymes are responsible for most of the tissue damage and hemorrhage associated with most viperid bites  <cit>  and contribute to predigestion of prey  <cit> . similarly, the  <dig> c-type lectin  clusters accounted for just  <dig> % of the toxin reads. these toxins, which typically function as multimers, are major components of hemorrhagic viperid venoms and contribute to the disruption of hemostasis by affecting plasma components and blood cells  <cit> , ultimately leading to hemorrhage  <cit> . finally, a single myo cluster was detected, but it accounted for just  <dig> % of the toxin reads. although myos appear to be compatible with both type i and type ii venoms  <cit> , their primary role appears to be rapid prey incapacitation. a highly potent neurotoxin like canebrake toxin may render this particular toxin unnecessary.

we detected a number of additional low-abundance toxins in the venom-gland transcriptome of c. horridus . we identified an l-amino acid oxidase  transcript, accounting for  <dig> % of the toxin reads. laaos are associated with edema, apoptosis, and the inhibition of platelet aggregation  <cit> . a single cysteine-rich secretory protein  sequence accounted for  <dig> % of the toxin reads. crisps are thought to interfere with smooth-muscle contraction  <cit> . the remaining  <dig> putative toxin sequences accounted for  <dig> % of the toxin reads and included two vascular endothelial growth factors , a vespryn   <cit> , a nerve growth factor , a nucleotidase , three phosphodiesterases , a neurotrophic factor , two kunitz-type protease inhibitors , a hyaluronidase   <cit> , a cysteine-rich with egf-like domain protein , a glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase   <cit> , and a venom factor   <cit> .

type i versus type ii: mrna expression differences underlie rapid phenotypic evolution
the profiles of toxin classes expressed by type ii c. horridus and its type i congener c. adamanteus were vastly different but consistent with their classifications as type i and type ii venoms . these drastic differences were present despite the similarities in sizes, diets, and natural history of these two species and the similarity in the relative transcriptional effort expended on venom production . type ii venoms tend to be proteomically simpler than type i  <cit> , and the transcriptome profiles that underlie these two venoms followed this trend. crotalus adamanteus had  <dig> unique toxin sequences that fell into  <dig> clusters. crotalus horridus had just  <dig> unique toxin sequences in  <dig> clusters. in terms of unique venom transcripts or toxin clusters, c. horridus had approximately  <dig> to 66% the complexity of c. adamanteus. in terms of major toxin classes, the simplicity of c. horridus venom was even more apparent. svsps, pla2s, and, to a lesser extent, bpp made up most of the c. horridus venom transcripts , whereas the venom of c. adamanteus had a more even expression distribution over svmps, ctls, svsps, myo, pla2s, and laao transcripts .

the prevalence of the more complex type i venoms in rattlesnakes  <cit>  is difficult to reconcile with the advantages type ii venoms appear to confer. the higher lethality of type ii venoms implies greater efficacy in prey capture and reduced energetic costs, although toxicity has not been measured in natural, sympatric prey populations. complex traits have been hypothesized to pay a cost in terms of their rates of adaptation  <cit> , but this result depends on high levels of pleiotropy that do not appear to hold in most natural systems  <cit> . on the other hand, the higher complexity of type i venoms could lead to higher survival probability by means of functional redundancy, mutational robustness, and even increased rates of adaptation through an enlarged mutational target  <cit> . these potential advantages for type i venoms would provide more of a long-term evolutionary advantage, whereas the increased toxicity of type ii venoms provide an immediate short-term fitness advantage. this hypothesized conflict between short-term and long-term advantages might explain both the overall prevalence of type i venoms among rattlesnakes and the fact that most species with type ii venoms are still polymorphic for type i, even though type ii venom dominates certain geographic regions.

type ii venoms are defined in part by their lack of hemorrhagic effects and, in particular, low svmp activity. for the type i venom of c. adamanteus, svmps were the most highly expressed toxin class, accounting for  <dig> % of the reads mapping to toxins. in stark contrast, svmps were almost undetectable in the expressed genes of the c. horridus venom-gland transcriptome, accounting for just  <dig> % of the toxin reads . ctls contribute to hemorrhage by either inhibiting or activating, and thereby depleting, coagulation factors  <cit> . they account for  <dig> % of the toxin reads for c. adamanteus but just  <dig> % of the toxin reads for c. horridus . the lack of hemorrhagic activity by c. horridus venom can therefore be explained by the lack of expression of genes responsible for this activity; we do not yet know whether all of these genes are still present in the genome but no longer expressed, or whether they have been lost from the genome. we do know, however, that some are present but expressed only in minute amounts .

type ii venoms are characterized by significant neurotoxic effects mediated generally by heterodimeric pla2s homologous to crotoxin. the crotoxin homolog in c. horridus, canebrake toxin, is responsible for most of the toxicity of the type a venoms  <cit> , and also accounts in part for the difference in pla <dig> expression levels between c. adamanteus and c. horridus . crotalus adamanteus expressed modest amounts of pla <dig> transcripts , but, for c. horridus, pla2s were the second most abundant class . in c. scutulatus, which shows similar venom types to c. horridus, populations with predominantly type ii venom show a corresponding absence of myo  <cit> , which causes myonecrosis and spastic hind-leg paralysis. the most abundantly expressed gene in the c. adamanteus venom-gland transcriptome was a myo related to crotamine, but this gene was barely detectable in our type ii c. horridus, accounting for just  <dig> % of the toxin reads. this toxin’s probable role, prey incapacitation, is probably subsumed by the action of canebrake toxin in c. horridus.

both species expressed high levels of svsp transcripts, although svsp transcripts accounted for a significantly larger portion of the toxin expression in c. horridus than in c. adamanteus . interestingly, the acidic subunit of crotoxin and its homologs are proteolytically cleaved into three peptides to produce the mature toxin; the protease responsible for the reaction is unknown, but could potentially be one or more serine proteinases, which might account for the higher expression of svsps in c. horridus.

a full proteomic characterization  <cit>  and comparison will be necessary to determine whether the expression differences described above account for all of the differences in composition between the venoms of c. adamanteus and c. horridus. we have shown that dramatic changes in expression patterns for toxin gene classes underlie the correspondingly dramatic differences in venom composition and can account for the major pharmacological differences in the effects of the two venoms. in addition to the expression changes by toxin classes, changes of expression among paralogs within classes and sequence changes in individual toxins could also contribute to the different properties of the venoms . nonetheless, we have shown that extremely large and evolutionarily significant phenotypic changes between closely related species can be mediated by major changes in gene-expression patterns involving many genes, even over short evolutionary times. these dramatic changes in expression highlight a major advantage of chemical means of prey incapacitation and defense. because venom genes, as far as is known, are expressed only in the venom glands , major alterations in venom-gene expression can be achieved with no antagonistic pleiotropic effects. similar large expression shifts for more typical genes would probably be strongly deleterious. venoms are clean phenotypic modules that can undergo large changes with few, if any, deleterious pleiotropic effects, giving them potential for high evolvability.

type ii venoms differ extensively among species
although type ii venoms are unified in their broad pharmacological properties, they are far from uniform in their compositions. in those cases where it has been investigated, the neurotoxicity of these venoms was derived from the heterodimeric pla <dig> crotoxin and its homologs, but the few data available suggest differences in the remainder of the expressed genes as well as in the relative amount of crotoxin homologs. a low-coverage venom-gland transcriptome for c. durissus collilineatus <cit> , which expresses type ii venom, showed that the transcripts encoding the two subunits of crotoxin account for 88% of the toxin-encoding transcripts. in contrast, pla <dig> transcripts as a class only accounted for  <dig> % of the toxin reads for c. horridus. svsp transcripts were the most abundant toxin class for c. horridus at  <dig> % of the toxin reads, but they only accounted for  <dig> % of the toxin sequences for c. durissus collilineatus. proteomic data from c. simus neonates  <cit>  and c. tigris <cit> , both of which express type ii venoms, suggest a closer agreement with our results. in both cases, however, the svsps were expressed at lower levels than for c. horridus , and the pla2s were expressed at higher levels . note, however, that we are comparing transcriptomes to proteomes, which do not always show quantitative agreement  <cit> . nonetheless, these differences may be responsible for the lower ld <dig> for the venom of c. tigris  compared to type ii c. horridus   <cit> .

if we assume that type i venom in adults is ancestral on the basis of its higher frequency among extant species  <cit> , then the transition to type ii venom has occured multiple times in rattlesnakes within the last ∼ <dig>  million years  <cit> , a remarkable example of parallel phenotypic evolution. calvete et al.  <cit>  suggested that for c. durissus, type ii venom represents a paedomorphic trait. if the ancestral state of rattlesnakes involved a switch between type ii venom in neonates to type i as adults, such as is currently seen in c. simus <cit> , paedomorphism could provide a simple mechanism for frequent parallel evolution  <cit> . unfortunately, the frequency of type ii to type i ontogenetic shifts in rattlesnakes is unknown, although ontogenetic shifts in venom composition are not uncommon in viperids  <cit> . of course, given the well-known among-species variation in venom composition of adult snakes, we expect similar levels of variation among juvenile venoms, thereby compounding the difficulties in elucidating the evolutionary history and patterns for snake venoms. a full investigation into the mechanisms of evolution of type ii venom phenotypes in rattlesnakes, including determination of whether they represent paedomorphic traits, could provide insight into the repeatability of and constraints on large-scale phenotypic evolution.

toxin gene-family expansion and differential paralog expression
the evolution of animal-toxin multigene families is characterized by frequent gene gain and loss and strong positive selective pressures  <cit> . such patterns have been described for pla2s  <cit>  and three-finger toxins  <cit>  in snakes. unfortunately, studies of these gene families rely on sparse and unsystematic sampling of toxin sequences within species and uneven sampling across species  <cit>  because, until recently  <cit> , complete, sequence-based characterizations of the venom components of a species were not feasible. such sampling deficiencies probably introduce little, if any, bias into statistical tests of positive selection, but could have substantial impacts on the estimation of duplication and gene-loss rates. in particular, this bias could generate spurious signals for gene loss  <cit> . with our two high-coverage venom-gland transcriptomes for c. horridus and c. adamanteus, we provided the first detailed characterization of toxin gene-family evolution for snakes. note that we could only detect sequences present in the genome and expressed in the venom glands, so gene loss in this context means that the gene was either deleted from the genome or it was no longer expressed. we only considered the evolution of the pla2s and svsps, because these two families were the only two diverse gene families expressed at appreciable levels in both species.

we identified nine pla <dig> transcripts for c. horridus and six for c. adamanteus  and used a related sequence from the european rabbit  as our outgroup. this outgroup sequence was selected on the basis of tblastx searches of our pla <dig> sequences against the ncbi nonredundant nt database, excluding results from viperids. to reconcile the pla <dig> gene-family tree with the known species tree required at least  <dig> duplication events, one loss in c. horridus, and  <dig> losses in c. adamanteus . crotalus adamanteus lacked orthologs for the two most highly expressed pla <dig> paralogs for c. horridus: chorr pla2-1a and chorr pla2- <dig>  both species had bursts of species-specific gene-family expansion that involved multiple duplication events . the most highly expressed pla <dig> for c. adamanteus, cadam pla2-1a, was part of a five-sequence clade unique to c. adamanteus. similarly, the second most highly expressed pla <dig> for c. horridus, chorr pla2-1a, was part of a four-sequence clade unique to c. horridus. these results suggest that gene-family expansion and expression levels are related, although this apparent relationship could simply reflect the use of expansion as a means of increasing expression levels. we identified  <dig> and  <dig> svsp transcripts for c. horridus and c. adamanteus, respectively . the phylogeny of these sequences, with an elapid svsp as an outgroup, showed a complex pattern of gene gain and loss, with an estimated  <dig> duplication events, three losses in c. horridus, and two losses in c. adamanteus . in constrast to the pla2s, svsps showed no massive species-specific clade expansions, although species-specific duplication events were common . similarly to the pla2s, the svsp clades expressed at high levels were different between the two species. for example, the most highly expressed svsp for c. horridus, chorr svsp-1a, was paired with a low-expression c. adamanteus ortholog, cadam svsp- <dig>  our results provided the first detailed characterization of toxin gene-family evolution across closely related species. we found an overall pattern of gene-family expansion, with duplications greatly outnumbering losses. at the full-venom level, transcriptional effort among toxin classes was found to be dramatically different between c. horridus and c. adamanteus , and this same pattern repeated itself at a finer scale among paralogs within toxin classes . even over the short time scale of divergence between congeners, expression levels for toxins were highly dynamic.

sequence divergence between crotalus adamanteus and c. horridus
claims abound of increased and exceptional evolutionary rates and selective pressures affecting snake venom genes  <cit> , but these studies suffer from major limitations. with the exception of gibbs and rossiter  <cit> , these studies average rates over the history of gene families and species and therefore capture only long-term patterns of molecular evolution. the most significant problem with these studies is the complete lack of a null expectation for molecular evolutionary patterns in snakes. we would like to know the proportion of venom genes that are evolving quickly over short time scales and whether these genes, and by implication the venom trait itself, are unique within the genome in terms of their evolutionary patterns. to address these questions, we used our annotated nontoxin sequences from c. adamanteus and c. horridus as the basis for our null expectation for molecular evolution and compared the patterns for toxins to the patterns for nontoxins. to generate our null expectations, we identified orthologous pairs of nontoxins for the two species by means of reciprocal-blast analyses. we excluded mitochondrially encoded sequences from these analyses because of their well-known high evolutionary rates. each sequence for each species was searched against a database generated for the other species, and we performed separate searches on amino-acid sequences with blastp and nucleotide sequences with blastn. we only kept pairs of putative orthologs that were each others’ best matches for both analyses. from the  <dig>  sequences from c. horridus and the  <dig>  from c. adamanteus, we identified  <dig>  putatively orthologous pairs. we excluded  <dig> pairs after alignment because their alignments contained more than  <dig> gapped positions, leaving  <dig>  aligned pairs of orthologs. a similar treatment with the  <dig> toxin clusters from c. adamanteus and  <dig> from c. horridus yielded  <dig> toxin alignments.

we conducted three separate analyses of molecular evolution. for the first , we compared the pairwise nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution-rate ratios  of the toxins to the nontoxins. because our species were closely related and an accurate estimate of dn/ds requires sufficient synonymous divergence, we first estimated pairwise ds values and excluded pairs from the analysis if ds< <dig> . in addition, we excluded pairs for which ds> <dig>  to avoid spurious orthologs. these constraints left  <dig>  nontoxin pairs and  <dig> toxin pairs. the average dn/ds for nontoxins was  <dig> , and the average for toxins was significantly higher at  <dig>  . as a class, toxins have a higher dn/ds than the background nontoxins. we used the individual values from the nontoxins to generate a null distribution for genomic pairwise dn/ds and compared our toxin values to this null distribution . nine of  <dig> toxin pairs exceeded the 95th percentile of the null distribution, but we expected fewer than two exceedances if the distributions were the same. about 30% of toxin pairs have exceptionally high dn/ds ratios. as a class of sequences and at the individual level, toxins are distinct from nontoxins in terms of their dn/ds ratios. the low level of sequence divergence between our two species suggests that estimation of the dn/ds ratio may be inaccurate, so we conducted two additional analyses that were free of the issues of estimating a ratio where the denominator is expected to be quite small. we estimated null distributions of ds and dn separately for comparison with the corresponding values from the toxins . if toxins are uniquely under positive selection, we would expect to see higher rates of substitution for nonsynonymous mutations, but we have no reason to expect a corresponding increase in synonymous substitution rates. synonymous substitution rate can therefore serve as a control. for both analyses, we excluded pairs with ds> <dig>  as for our dn/ds analysis. for dn, we found that the average value for toxins was  <dig> , which was significantly higher than the value of  <dig>  for nontoxins . a majority of toxin pairs  exceeded the 95% threshold established by the nontoxin comparisons . however, we also found that toxins had a higher ds than nontoxins , and seven of  <dig> toxin pairs exceeded the nontoxin 95% threshold. six of these seven pairs consisted of ctls, which were expressed at extremely low levels in the c. horridus transcriptome. these pairs possibly represent incorrectly paired paralogs that resulted from the low ctl coverage for c. horridus. excluding these exceptional seven from the dn analysis still left  <dig> of  <dig> toxin pairs exceeding the dn threshold established by the nontoxins. as expected for two closely related species, the distributions of pairwise dn  and ds  showed peaks at zero, corresponding to pairs with little to no sequence divergence. the distribution for ds had a second mode corresponding to approximately 1% sequence divergence.

we have shown that even over the short amount of time since c. horridus and c. adamanteus shared a common ancestor, many, but by no means all, venom-encoding genes have evolved in an exceptional manner compared to other coding sequences in the genome. about 30% of toxin sequences showed evidence for a higher dn/ds ratio relative to the nontoxin background sequences, a pattern consistent with those sequences having experienced stronger and/or more prolonged positive selection. only about 20% of toxins, however, showed dn/ds> <dig> , which is definitive and extremely conservative  <cit>  evidence for positive selection as opposed to relaxed purifying selection. we also showed that about 50% of toxin sequences had exceptionally high nonsynonymous substitution rates relative to nontoxins, which is also consistent with strong, continual positive selection acting on toxins, although relaxed purifying selection cannot be ruled out. our null distributions for these measures were derived from evolutionary patterns for a diverse array of nontoxin sequences that were expressed in the venom glands of both species and therefore may not reflect the prevailing patterns throughout the rest of the genome. our large sample size of nearly  <dig>  nontoxin genes, however, represents a substantial fraction of the coding sequences in the genome. in addition, the extremely different venom compositions of our two species resulted in a fairly small sample size for toxins. while this small sample size was sufficient to demonstrate the molecular-evolutionary distinctiveness of toxins compared to nontoxins, future comparisons among species with the same venom types will provide more power and higher-resolution characterizations of the differences in evolutionary patterns between toxins and nontoxins.

conserved nontoxin-expression patterns between crotalus adamanteus and c. horridus
the differences in expression patterns between c. adamanteus and c. horridus for genes encoding putative toxins are dramatic  and commensurate with the phenotypic difference in their venoms’ effects, but these toxin genes are only a minute portion of the genes expressed at high levels in the venom glands . rokyta et al.  <cit>  found that for c. adamanteus, the nontoxin expression was heavily biased towards genes involved in protein production and metabolism, as expected for a tissue specialized for protein secretion. regardless of the particular proteins secreted, the basic protein-secretory function of snake venom-glands should be consistent across species, and we therefore expected expression patterns among nontoxin sequences to be more similar than patterns for toxins. to test this hypothesis, we conducted a reciprocal-blast analysis to identify orthologous sequences between the two species and compared their expression levels. for a pair of sequences to be included in our analysis, the two sequences had to have been each other’s best blast hit for both a nucleotide-based and an animo-acid-based search with blastn and blastp, respectively. we excluded mitochondrially encoded sequences for simplicity, leaving  <dig>  nontoxins for c. adamanteus and  <dig>  nontoxins for c. horridus. from these sequences, we identified  <dig>  reciprocal blast matches . for expression levels, we used the number of reads mapping to each sequence based on aligning  <dig> million reads from each species to their own transcript sequences. because the same number of reads were used for each species, this procedure is effectively equivalent to using a percentage. if the overall expression levels for nontoxins were similar between the two species, which appeared to be the case , and the expression levels of individual nontoxins were similar, we would expect a linear relationship between expression values for the two species with a slope of one and an intercept at zero. instead, we found a good linear fit , but with a slope of  <dig>  and intercept of  <dig> reads when we used c. horridus expression values as a response variable. this lower-than-expected slope appeared to be caused by a single major outlier point representing a protein disulfide isomerase, the most highly expressed nontoxin identified for both species. removal of this single point gave a good fit  with a slope of  <dig>  and an intercept of  <dig>  indicating that expression levels for nontoxin sequences present for both species are generally in close agreement.

our reciprocal-blast analysis indicated fairly extensive overlap between the nontoxins identified by means of independent de novo transcriptome assemblies for each species, but each species had ∼ <dig>  sequences without reciprocal-blast hits. this difference could reflect a difference in the identities of particular genes expressed in the two species’ venom-glands, which would represent a substantial difference in expression patterns, or it could simply represent a stochastic difference in the genes that were successfully assembled and annotated. to determine which of these two possibilities was true, we first filtered reads matching toxins for each species and then aligned  <dig> million of the filtered reads from each species against both sets of annotated nontoxin sequences. for the c. adamanteus nontoxins, c. horridus reads mapped to all but four template sequences . for the c. horridus nontoxins, c. adamanteus reads mapped to all but a single nontoxin sequence . the estimated expression levels in terms of number of mapped reads agreed well between both species for both sets of nontoxins . in addition, the total percentages of mapped reads were similar for both species for both sets of nontoxins. for the c. adamanteus transcripts,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the reads mapped for c. adamanteus and c. horridus, respectively. for the c. horridus transcripts,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the reads mapped for c. adamanteus and c. horridus, respectively. note that in figures 8a and 8b, read counts when mapping a species’ reads against its own transcripts showed a pattern of truncation on the lower end. this truncation reflects our procedure for selecting transcripts for annotation; we only tried to annotate contigs with at least  <dig> reads for each round of assembly.

gene expression patterns generally appear to be under stabilizing selection  <cit> , and the analyses above showed that nontoxin expression patterns were conserved across c. adamanteus and c. horridus despite major changes in expression patterns for toxin genes. this makes functional sense, because the same types of molecular machinery are needed to serve the secretory function of the venom-gland cells regardless of the particulars of the proteins being expressed, but it does raise questions about the regulatory control of gene expression in the venom glands. given the large number of genes involved for both the toxins and nontoxins, and the relatively short divergence time between these species, it seems likely that toxins and nontoxins are under different regulatory control. this difference in control could contribute to the evolvability of venom by allowing large-scale changes in venom-gene expression without altering the underlying machinery for toxin production.

CONCLUSIONS
rattlesnakes rely on their venoms for feeding and defense, and the ecological and evolutionary significance of these venoms ensures variation in their properties and compositions both within and between species. the most dramatic differences in rattlesnake venom properties correspond to a long-recognized dichotomy between neurotoxic and hemorrhagic venoms  <cit> . the timber rattlesnake  generally has hemorrhagic venom, but populations along the southern edge of their range express highly lethal, neurotoxic venom  <cit> . we sequenced the venom-gland transcriptome of an individual from one of these populations and compared the results to corresponding data from the eastern diamondback rattlesnake   <cit> , a congener with hemorrhagic venom.

the neurotoxic  venom of c. horridus was about half as complex in terms of number of expressed genes as the hemorrhagic  venom of c. adamanteus. this simplicity of type ii venom might explain the general prevalence of type i venoms in rattlesnakes  <cit> , despite the apparent advantage in potency of type ii venoms. the higher complexity of type i venoms could provide evolutionary advantages in terms of functional redundancy, mutational robustness, and increased rates of adaptation through an enlarged mutational target. the primary basis for the lower complexity of the type ii venom of c. horridus was the almost complete loss of expression of the two major classes of diverse hemorrhagic toxins in type i venoms, the ctls and svmps. overall, we found that the drastic difference in venom properties resulted from major changes in expression levels of toxin gene families, differential gene-family expansion and loss, changes in which paralogs within gene families were expressed at high levels, and higher dn and dn/ds values in the toxin genes relative to nontoxins. despite the major expression differences for toxin transcripts, nontoxin expression patterns were consistent across the two species. our work represents the first high-throughput comparative venom-gland transcriptomics study for snakes and therefore provides the first complete, in-depth look at patterns of toxin gene-family evolution, molecular evolution, and expression evolution in venomous snakes.
