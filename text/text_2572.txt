BACKGROUND
escherichia coli o157:h <dig> is the most commonly implicated serotype of shiga-toxin producing e. coli  or enterohemorrhagic e. coli  associated with hemorrhagic colitis and the hemolytic uremic syndrome   <cit> . it is recognized world-wide as an important cause of both sporadic cases and outbreaks of food- and waterborne disease. genomic diversity within populations of this pathogen is extensive and genome comparisons have revealed many dna insertion/deletion and recombination events which are thought to be driven primarily through bacteriophage-mediated and other mechanisms of lateral gene transfer  <cit> .

three genetic lineages of e. coli o157:h <dig> have been described using octamer-based genome scanning  and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization . lineage i strains are commonly isolated from both cattle and clinically ill humans, lineage ii strains are isolated primarily from cattle and intermediate lineage i/ii strains are less well characterized with respect to phenotype and host distribution  <cit> . additional studies on the evolution, population structure and genetic diversity of escherichia coli o157:h <dig> have been carried out using a number of different genotyping approaches, each of which is based on targeting polymorphisms in a particular locus or set of loci. for example, the presence of shiga-toxin  containing bacteriophage integration sites has been used to describe sixteen e. coli o157:h <dig> genotypes   <cit> . multi-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis , which targets the number of repeats at nine genetic loci in the method proposed for pulsenet, has recently been used for epidemiological typing of o157:h <dig> strains  <cit> . mcgh, which examines the presence or absence of every gene in the genome of a reference strain or strains, has been used to elucidate the step-wise emergence of o157:h <dig> strains from an o55:h7-like ancestor  <cit>  and by our laboratory to first characterize lineage i/ii strains  <cit> . single-nucleotide polymorphism  typing examines the single nucleotide changes throughout the e. coli o157:h <dig> genome; snps in  <dig> loci have been used to delineate  <dig> genotypes in over  <dig> strains, which have been partitioned into nine evolutionary clades  <cit> . one of these clades  was found to contain putative hyper-virulent strains, including those implicated in the  <dig> spinach- and lettuce-associated outbreaks in the united states. comparative genomic fingerprinting , which examines the presence or absence of the most common variable loci within the genome, has recently been used with  <dig> loci to analyze  <dig> o157:h <dig> strains, and to group them into lineages and epidemiologically and phenotypically related clusters  <cit> .

the various methods have proved useful on their own but in most cases the strain groupings from one method are not easily relatable to another, and none of these methods has yet achieved the "gold standard" status to be used as a common genotyping method. because each of these genotyping approaches can provide important information on isolates with different pathogenic and virulence characteristics, the need to replicate each of these methods using a common group of reference strains has arisen. however, present restrictions on international strain exchange make the acquisition of certain reference strains nearly impossible for researchers outside the country of origin of the strains. while the stepwise emergence of e. coli o157:h <dig> from an o55:h7-like serotype has been advanced  <cit> , the relationship among e. coli o157:h <dig> lineages and clades incorporating data from standard and more advanced genotyping methods has not been evaluated. thus, discoveries such as the recently described hyper-virulent clade of e. coli o157:h <dig> strains  <cit>  are framed only in the context of the individual study.

recently, three complete e. coli o157:h <dig> strain sequences and  <dig> whole genome shotgun sequences have become available in genbank. with the additional sequencing of one o157:h <dig> and one o145:nm strain by our group, the availability of multiple whole-genome sequences has allowed us to apply several molecular typing schemes in silico to a group of e. coli o157:h <dig> and related strains. we have applied six molecular typing methods shown to differentiate among e. coli o157:h <dig> strains to a panel of nineteen genome-sequenced strains: stx-bacteriophage insertion site typing  <cit> , cgf  <cit> , mcgh  <cit> , snp genotyping  <cit> , genomic in silico subtractive hybridization   and mlva <cit> .

in this study we provide a view of the relationships among e. coli o157:h <dig> strains based on a supernetwork representation of these six separate molecular typing methods. we also show how hyper-virulent clade  <dig> e. coli o157:h <dig> strains fit into this scheme and suggest the use of genotyping approaches that are relatable as part of a "common genotyping language" until whole genome sequencing becomes routine in bacterial strain genotyping.

RESULTS
lineage typing
the is-pcr lspa <dig> typing of the e. coli o157:h <dig> strains in table  <dig> designated strains ec <dig> and tw <dig> as lineage i, eleven of the  <dig> genbank strains and the in-house strain ec <dig> as lineage i/ii, and strain ec <dig> as lineage ii.

stx-phage insertion site typing
besser et al.  <cit>  found greater diversity within o157:h <dig> strains isolated from cattle than those from human clinical illness, but the relationship between their typing scheme and lineage groupings was not explored. in table  <dig> it is evident from in silico analysis that all genotypes based on the stx-phage integration site typing can be related to mcgh lineage.

all lineage i strains were of genotype  <dig> in that they possessed both stx <dig> and stx <dig> and both bacteriophage integration sites yehv and wrba were occupied. additionally, they all possessed the "k" form of the n135k polymorphism in the fimh mannose binding pocket, lacked stx2c, had the "t" form of the t238a polymorphism in tir and were positive for the q-stx <dig> junction of phage 933w.

all lineage i/ii strains were of genotype  <dig> in that they contained stx <dig> but not stx <dig> and contained an occupied yehv and an intact wrba bacteriophage integration site. additionally, they all possessed the "n" form of the n135k polymorphism in the fimh mannose binding pocket and the "t" form of the t238a polymorphism in tir. however, the q-stx <dig> junction of phage 933w and stx2c were variably present among the lineage i/ii strains.

lineage ii strain ec <dig> was of genotype  <dig>  it contained both stx <dig> and stx <dig> had the variant-r form of the yehv bacteriophage right junction and an intact wrba integration site. ec <dig> possessed stx2c, the "a" form of the t238a polymorphism in tir, the "n" form of the n135k polymorphism in the fimh mannose binding pocket and was negative for the q-stx <dig> junction of phage 933w. the raw data for this and all other in silico typing methods are provided .

snp genotyping
the clade of each strain based on snp typing was determined as described by riordan et al.  <cit>  where snps in the four genes ecs <dig>  ecs <dig>  ecs <dig> and ecs <dig> allow the delineation of the four most common clades of e. coli o157:h <dig>  our analysis typed edl <dig> as clade  <dig> , sakai as clade  <dig> , tw <dig> and ec <dig> as clade  <dig> , ec <dig> as one of clades 4â€“ <dig>  and the remaining o157:h <dig> strains as members of the hyper-virulent clade  <dig>  .

gissh-based novel region distribution
the microarray used in the study by zhang et al.  <cit>  was based on lineage i strains edl <dig> and sakai and the k <dig> strain mg <dig>  so it is not surprising that the lineage i strains were found to contain more of the lineage i markers than strains from the other lineages. to account for novel genomic regions present in other o157:h <dig> strains, but not found in edl <dig> or sakai, an in silico subtractive hybridization was performed on every o157:h <dig> sequence in table  <dig> against edl <dig> and sakai . the study found  <dig> separate regions comprising  <dig> segments of approximately  <dig> bp in length . the distribution of these segments in silico is shown in figure  <dig> and highlights the fact that lineage i strains possess genomic regions not represented in the original microarray probe set, as well as the fact that there are other lineage i/ii and lineage ii specific genomic regions.

combined analysis
the maximum parsimony trees from each method shared a number of commonalities . all three lineages grouped distinctly with the following methods: cgf, snp genotyping, mcgh and gissh-based novel region typing. stx-phage insertion site typing distinguished lineage i strains as a separate cluster but lineage ii strain ec <dig> did not form a distinct cluster from the lineage i/ii strains. similarly, mlva put lineage ii strain ec <dig> on its own branch, whereas the lineage i/ii and lineage i strains did not group separately with this method. all of the genotyping methods except mcgh identified lineage i/ii strains ec <dig> and ec <dig> as a separate cluster, which was placed into a group close to the lineage i strains in the cgf and stx-phage insertion site based maximum parsimony trees and was placed between lineage i strain sakai and the other three lineage i strains in the maximum parsimony tree based on mlva data.

in order to obtain a more complete understanding of the relationships among e. coli o157:h <dig> strains, the maximum parsimony trees derived using in silico data from the six separate molecular typing methods included in this study were combined to form a supernetwork. we accomplished this by combing the six maximum parsimony trees generated using paup* instead of concatenating the data into a single matrix and generating a single most parsimonious tree. this ensured a method with many data points such as mcgh did not outweigh a method like mlva that contains few data points. the supernetwork based on the six trees given equal weighting  shows competing signals, rather than an inferred absolute tree  <cit> . as can be seen, the  <dig> strains were distributed into four main groups. one contained strains k <dig> mg <dig> and o145:nm ec <dig> and another the single lineage ii strain ec <dig>  the remaining two groups of the supernetwork were lineage-specific, comprising one cluster of lineage i strains and another of lineage i/ii strains. the distribution of the four lineage i strains was consistent with the clade breakdown of manning et al.  <cit> , as the clade  <dig> strains tw <dig> and ec <dig> were more closely related to each other than clade  <dig> strain edl <dig> or clade  <dig> strain sakai.

because only a relatively small number of strains have been sequenced, we repeated the analysis including experimental microarray  <cit>  and cgf data  <cit>  for which lineage information was available to provide a larger context for our in silico analysis. this added  <dig> strains to the  <dig> strain in silico dataset and included data for three e. coli o55:h <dig> strains and two sorbitol-fermenting e. coli o157:h-strains , allowing us to frame the resulting supernetwork within the context of the proposed stepwise emergence of e. coli o157:h <dig>  <cit> . the supernetwork in figure  <dig> again showed four main groups. all lineage i and ii strains formed discrete branches in the supernetwork, while the lineage i/ii strains formed a cluster that was closest to e. coli k <dig> and strains of o55:h <dig>  o145:nm and sorbitol-fermenting o157:h-.

discussion
the acquisition and loss of genetic elements in e. coli o157:h <dig> is thought to affect the virulence of this pathogen in humans  <cit> . while attributes like the stxs  <cit>  and the locus of enterocyte attachment and effacement   <cit>  are well known, other less well characterized elements such as non-lee effectors s  <cit>  may contribute to the spectrum of virulence that has been captured for stec within the seropathotype classification  <cit> .

this genomic diversity can largely be attributed to bacteriophages  <cit>  and other mobile elements  <cit>  that cause dna segment insertion and deletion events, rather than single-nucleotide changes  <cit> . the best characterization of diversity within e. coli o157:h <dig> must therefore take both single-nucleotide changes and large region turnover events into consideration. whole genome sequencing is the best method for such analysis, but until the number of completely sequenced strains increases and whole genome sequencing becomes both routine and cost-effective, an estimation of whole genomic change based on sampling of polymorphisms or variability at a number of specific loci will have to suffice. a number of molecular genotyping methods have recently emerged that target different regions and types of variation, so the combination of data from these methods can offer a picture that is greater than the sum of their individual views. it can be argued that lateral gene transfer obscures the relationship among bacterial strains; however, once mobile elements are acquired and if they are stably maintained, they can be especially valuable in assessing strain relationships. we therefore advocate the use of genotyping methods that rely on multiple spatially distinct loci to provide a robust view of the o157:h <dig> population structure. each individual multi-locus method in our study pointed to a similar tree structure and the combination of methods in the supernetwork  showed three distinct lineages, two of which were originally proposed by kim et al.  <cit>  and the third by zhang et al.  <cit> , adding confidence to the conclusion that these lineages exist.

the results of snp genotyping over  <dig> o157:h <dig> isolates found hyper-virulent clade  <dig> strains, the causative agents in the spinach- and lettuce-related outbreaks of  <dig> in the united states, to be most closely related to sorbitol fermenting e. coli o157:nm strains  <cit> . based on our in silico analyses, these clade  <dig> strains, which appear to be increasing in prevalence and have a greater association with hus than other strains  <cit> , are members of lineage i/ii . interestingly, e. coli o157:h <dig> strain tw <dig> was designated as clade  <dig> in the initial publication on variation in virulence among the clades  <cit> , but all in silico analyses conducted during this study on the whole-genome shotgun sequence available from genbank  suggests it belongs to clade  <dig> .

it must be recognized that the publicly available genome sequences are not error-free and that this could have affected the architecture of trees that are highly dependent on single nucleotide changes in sequences of target genes, such as snp-genotyping. however, the in silico tree architecture was very similar to that described by manning et al.  <cit>  based on experimental data; therefore we suspect that this was not a significant source of error in this study.

differences between lineage i and lineage ii strains have been described  <cit> , but much less is known about lineage i/ii strains with respect to host/disease association or expression of virulence attributes. we have recently demonstrated in a study of e. coli o157:h <dig> strains in canada that certain phage types s are specific to o157:h <dig> lineages  <cit> . in the latter study, pt <dig> strains were shown to belong exclusively to lineage i/ii, however, others strains in lineage i/ii belonged to pts that were not lineage-restricted e.g. pt <dig>  pt <dig> and pt <dig>  suggesting that this lineage is widespread and also diverse. such diversity was also apparent in the examination of the novel regions of o157:h <dig> dna, presented in figure  <dig> 

the stxs, which are bacteriophage-encoded and the primary virulence factors of e. coli o157:h <dig>  <cit>  show differential distribution among the lineages. the stx <dig> gene was found in nearly all o157:h <dig> lineage i and lineage i/ii strains  <cit> , while the stx <dig> gene was absent in lineage i/ii strains but present in nearly all other strains studied. additionally, ziebell et al.  <cit>  found the stx2c gene in  <dig> % of lineage ii strains,  <dig> % of lineage i/ii strains and  <dig> % of lineage i strains, while manning et al.  <cit>  found stx2c to be present in  <dig> % of clade  <dig> strains. this snp genotyping study also found a significant relationship between the presence of stx <dig> in conjunction with stx2c among strains of clade  <dig>  in that no other clade associated with human illness displayed this combination. this is not surprising as lineage i strains only rarely contain stx2c despite their high association with human disease and lineage ii strains nearly always contain stx2c despite a rare association with human disease  <cit> . it is unlikely that the combination of stx <dig> and stx2c alone is the reason for the hyper-virulence of lineage i/ii strains, as the presence of stx2c is nearly ubiquitous among bovine-associated lineage ii strains. the snp genotyping study cited above only considered isolates associated with human disease; therefore it is likely that few lineage ii strains were included in the study. a study by friedrich et al.  <cit>  examining stx <dig> subtypes and their association with clinical symptoms found stx2c to be the only subtype besides stx <dig> present in strains isolated from cases of hus, but found no correlation between the presence of stx2c and the development of hus. it has recently been shown that the level of stx <dig> production is greater in lineage i strains than lineage ii strains  <cit>  so it may be that lineage i/ii strains implicated in cases of hus simply produce more toxin than other o157:h <dig> strains. however, it is possible that other factors possessed by the hyper-virulent lineage i/ii group strains are responsible for their greater virulence in humans, and remain to be discovered.

the findings in this study highlight the need for a common genotyping approach, as it is evident that the same groups of genetically related strains have been given multiple designations based on the use of different comparative genotyping methods. this need exists for epidemiological studies of outbreak strains, where strain discrimination is the primary focus, as well as for population genetic studies where genomic information is of central importance. the value of being able to compare a pattern produced in a particular laboratory to one found in a national central database has made pfge and pulsenet very useful in tracking outbreaks that are widely disseminated  <cit> , despite the fact that pfge is labour intensive and difficult to standardize  <cit> . as this common approach in identifying outbreak strains has been useful for a pattern-based method such as pfge, approaches based on a multi-locus sampling of the genome could take this centralized database concept and extend it to contain presence/absence data for specific loci, snps, and other measures of heterogeneity. in this way, whether the goal is identifying an outbreak source or using information for a population-based study, the data would be available in a central repository. this type of system would be important in monitoring and identifying the emergence of new clones of o157:h <dig>  such as the hyper-virulent lineage i/ii/clade  <dig> strains and recognizing other changes in the population when genotyping e. coli o157:h <dig> strains associated with disease outbreaks.

the availability of whole genome sequence information has led to the development of new genotyping methods that are easier to perform than traditional methods, more discriminatory and more informative with respect to genotype and phenotype. it is interesting that the approaches targeting genetic polymorphisms within conserved genes and those targeting genetic changes based on gene insertion/deletion events converge to give a similar picture of e. coli o157:h <dig> strain relationships. such concordance of methods has been previously demonstrated with mcgh and mlst for campylobacter jejuni  <cit>  and streptococcus pneumoniae  <cit> . however, given that methods differ greatly in terms of the time required for the analysis, labour and equipment required, need for expertise, freedom from subjectivity in interpretation of the data and portability of the genotyping results from one laboratory to another, there is considerable advantage in selecting a method that is simple, extensible and easily portable. while some typing methods are better than others in these aspects, most of the multi-locus typing methods examined produced a similar tree architecture. this suggests a "common typing language" is possible at least in the context that genotypes derived using different methods can be integrated and communicated in a broader framework. while it was shown that multiple methods converge to provide a similar picture of the o157:h <dig> population structure, we are not advocating the routine use of multiple genotyping methods but rather the use of methods based on comparative genomics.

with the genomic sequencing revolution well under way, the ability to harvest novel sequence information in a timely fashion from new genomic sequences will become increasingly important and the ability to include and compare in silico results to those from traditional laboratory experiments will become necessary.

the results of this study suggest that genotyping approaches based on common comparative genomic data are likely to form the basis for the next-generation of analytical tools used for both population-based comparative genotyping and epidemiological studies.

CONCLUSIONS
a combined analysis of several genotyping methods and supernetwork construction confirm that the e. coli o157:h <dig> population is distributed among three major lineages. recent work using snp genotyping has identified an emergent hyper-virulent clade of public health importance among nine snp-based clades of o157:h <dig>  however, due to the lack of a common genotyping language, this designation has not been relatable to other genotype classification schemes. using in silico analyses of multiple genome-sequenced strains we were able to integrate the overall diversity derived from individual methods into a more complete picture of the o157:h <dig> population structure and show that based on currently available o157:h <dig> genome sequence data, lineage i/ii and clade  <dig> strains are synonymous. further, some factor or factors other than the simple presence of stx2c are responsible for hyper-virulence among strains of this group. we have also previously shown that all pt <dig> strains examined belonged to lineage i/ii. future molecular typing and epidemiological studies should be aimed at providing genotyping data based on comparative genomic analyses. these data should be stored centrally and accessed locally in an easily transferable, relatable and extensible format that will form the basis of a common genotyping language.
