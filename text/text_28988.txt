BACKGROUND
genetic variation in the human genome takes many forms, ranging from large, microscopically visible chromosome anomalies to single-nucleotide changes. in general, forensic dna analysis compares biological samples searching for genetic similarities and differences by typing a small number of genetic variable segments in each sample. current methods used for performing forensic dna analysis mainly focus on typing several str  markers. strs are smaller than vntr sequences and can easily discriminate between both related and unrelated individuals  <cit> . at present, different optimized multiplex assays are used to analyze unique strs loci located on different chromosomes with the advantage of providing extremely low random match probability . the only drawback in current forensic dna typing systems is that sometimes pcr amplicons are excessively large . sometimes dna samples appear degraded into smaller fragments and therefore, the higher molecular-weight str loci can be scarcely amplified so creating incomplete dna profiles with lower discrimination power  <cit> . the presence of alternative types of dna polymorphic markers in the human genome i.e. single nucleotide polymorphisms , abundantly spread along the chromosomes, make it possible to develop different dna profiling techniques able to type smaller fragments of dna  compared to those detectable with str markers . in addition, due to the biallelic nature of snps, a size-based separation is not necessary so in turn making a higher level of multiplexing and automation possible compared to when using strs. the latter are extremely important in the implementation of large criminal dna databases  <cit> . furthermore, snps have smaller mutation rate   <cit>  compared to strs   <cit>  and the number of chromosomes which need typing to assess allele frequencies for snps are lower compared to strs because of the smaller number of alleles. nonetheless, several important factors have to be considered for an accurate selection of the snps to be used in forensic analysis. the first issue concerns the correct evaluation of the frequency of each snp among the populations. strs markers have many alleles and each of them show worldwide low frequency and consequently the random match probabilities are not usually strongly dissimilar among the populations. conversely, snp markers can show very dissimilar frequencies among different populations, causing a very large dependence of the match probability on the population frequencies used for the calculation  <cit> . an incorrect evaluation of snps frequencies may give rise to ambiguity in genetic results under specific conditions or in isolated populations. a second issue originates from the necessity to facilitate the stability and reproducibility of genetic typing for which forensic snps should be exclusively found in the human sequence and mapped in a single locus . another important issue to consider for a correct snps selection follows the discovery reported in several recent studies regarding the presence of an abundance of submicroscopic copy number variation of dna segments ranging from kilobases  to megabases  which include deletions, insertions, duplications and complex multi-site variants in all humans and other mammals  <cit> . these number variable regions  cover 12% of the genome. it is thus preferable that snps used in human identification are located outside the copy number variable regions. in addition, the snps used in forensic analysis should referentially not be located in coding/regulatory regions in order to avoid the possibility of obtaining unnecessary information concerning health status and/or disease susceptibility or resistance of the individual analyzed thus giving the courtroom the possibility to reject dna tests  <cit> . it follows that forensic markers should not be published as susceptibility/resistance/prognostic factors in scientific publications. the above mentioned issues highlight the importance of the availability of genetic databases to help facilitate snps selection. in this work, we present a combination of in silico and in vitro genetic analysis to validate and test a panel of  <dig> snps for human identification, selected on the basis of very stringent criteria. a total of  <dig>  genotypes of individuals originating from three different continents  were analysed to assess allele frequencies and the results were compared with current available snps databases. the specificity of selected snps for the human genome was tested by combining in silico selection and in vitro testing of non-human dna. in this study, we provide a list of  <dig> snps specifically designed for human identification and recommend an intensive use of current genetic database which can strongly improve the a priori selection of the snps because most analyses performed  in our samples confirmed in silico analysis.

RESULTS
selected snps are distributed across  <dig> autosomes and the two sexual chromosomes. six chromosomes contain more than  <dig> snp. the frequencies of the chosen snps are reported in table  <dig>  genotype frequencies observed for the selected snps in  <dig>  unrelated individuals showed their high informative capacity thus confirming the data reported in the hapmap database. the heterozygosity values calculated in the three populations considered in this study range between  <dig>  and  <dig> , the mean value being  <dig>  with a standard deviation of  <dig> . these latter values are quite similar to those reported in the hapmap database. in particular, the average heterozygosity observed in the typed italian samples was  <dig>  compared to the  <dig>  calculated on the basis of genotype frequencies reported for ceu samples in the hapmap database. no differences were noted between the heterozygosity observed in the benin and mongolian samples  and those reported for yri and chb in the hapmap database . while no differences in the mean heterozygosity of the entire panel of snps were observed, significant differences in allele frequencies of a number of snps compared to those reported in the hapmap database were noted. we observed significant differences between the italian and ceu  samples for four snps: rs <dig> , rs <dig> , rs <dig> , rs <dig>  . it should be mentioned that ceph samples were collected from people living in utah with ancestry from northern and western europe collected in  <dig> and it is unclear how accurately these samples reflect the patterns of genetic variation in people with northern and western european ancestry. we also observed a highly significant difference in allele frequency between the benin and yoruba samples  for the snp rs <dig>  and between the mongolian and han chinese samples  for two snps: rs <dig>  and rs <dig> . considering that genetic markers may also show dissimilar allele frequencies among populations due to differences in mutation rates, neutrality or linkage disequilibrium with other loci subjected to selection, the fst distribution of the selected snps in these populations was calculated. for each autosomal marker, the lower the fst value among the populations, the higher is the worldwide applicability of that specific snp for human identification. fst values ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> , while the mean value observed for all the autosomal snps was  <dig>  ±  <dig> . calculation of fst values on the hapmap data generated similar results: fst values ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> , while the mean value observed for all the autosomic snps is  <dig>  ±  <dig> . in order to ensure the independence of markers, all the syntenic autosomal snps selected were very far from each other, with a minimum distance of  <dig> mb observed between rs <dig> and rs <dig> on chromosome  <dig> . linkage disequilibrium  decays with map distance along the chromosome at a rate determined by the effective population size and therefore should not be expected in our syntenic snps. however, we assessed the independence of variation for all the selected snps by calculating pairwise ld values reported as r <dig>  most of the selected autosomal snps showed r <dig> values near zero: the average was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in europeans;  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in africans;  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in asians. the use of ld plotter software  <cit>  revealed no significant evidence of linkage disequilibrium  between markers mapped on chromosome y   <cit> . all the snps were selected to be specific for a single locus in the human genome. the typing of the snps in the dna from the closest living relative of homo sapiens  and macaca fascicularis made it possible to confirm in silico specificity  for  <dig> snps. we observed positive amplification for a single marker in macaca fascicularis and for five markers in pan troglodytes. snp rs <dig> was typed in macaca fascicularis dna and snps rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig> and rs <dig> were typed in pan troglodytes dna. all taqman assays that provided interpretable signal in real-time pcr were re-sequenced to determine the exact sequence homologies between the species. as expected on the basis of in silico and in vitro results, the random match probability using the entire  <dig> snps panel was very similar in the three populations tested:  <dig>  × 10- <dig> in europeans,  <dig>  × 10- <dig> in africans,  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  the cumulative random match probability shown above indicates that the likelihood that a specific profile occurs in more than a single individual is less than  <dig> in  <dig> , <dig> .

discussion
we carried out a study regarding the selection of a panel of  <dig> snps for forensic analysis. we mainly focused on in silico selection of snps to avoid unspecific non human amplification and unbalanced allele frequencies among the populations. through in silico searches, we selected snps located in only human-specific sequences. in vitro analysis showed that only five snps gave positive results when amplified in dna from the closest living relative of homo sapiens  and from macaca fascicularis. we would like to emphasise that this number is lower than figures reported do date in other studies. the latter demonstrates how useful it is to carefully select snps by comparing genomic sequences of different species  <cit> . we also excluded an interdependence of selected markers  by calculating the extention of ld .

when considering the average values  of the entire panel of snps calculated on the hapmap data, we observed no significant deviation. thus, the availability of genetic databases strongly facilitates snps selection as to their informative capacity: a priori selection criteria were confirmed by the genotyping of our populations. in the present study, we report snps showing very high heterozygosity values: the mean was  <dig>  ±  <dig> . although it is possible to observe significant differences between allele frequencies for specific snps, on average, the deviation in allele frequencies of a panel of snps between "expected"  and "observed"  seems not to be significant. these results may be due to divergences among the populations analyzed in this work and those typed in hapmap, or from the limited size of samples analyzed in the hapmap project. in fact, the mean heterozygosity calculated on the basis of genotype frequencies reported in the hapmap database was quite similar to the one calculated in this work . there is a similar situation regarding differences in fst values. accordingly, the differences in random match probabilities calculated on the basis of both observed and expected frequencies are not relevant. in particular, the rmp arising from data  reported in hapmap was  <dig>  × 10- <dig> quite similar to the one calculated in this work  <dig>  × 10- <dig> . the same situation is evident in african and asian populations where the rmp observed were similar to those calculated with the hapmap data :  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  in africans;  <dig>  × 10- <dig> . these data suggest that the main effort in developing a snp panel for forensic purposes should be mainly directed towards the selection of universal forensic snps to be used and on typing admixed populations in order to confirm the worldwide balance of allele frequencies of snps. the efficiency of the programs used for the alignment of genome sequences can strongly improve the process of selection of human-specific snps.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we selected and validated  <dig> snps useful for human identification. to generate allele frequencies, we used the real-time pcr. however, it should be noted that this technique cannot produce a multiplexing of the pcr and therefore, it could be of only limited use in forensic practice. we showed that current snps databases can efficiently improve and facilitate the selection of markers since most of the reported frequencies have been confirmed in recent works. the most important aspect of snps selection criteria is the choice of those snps with low fst among populations and with a single locus location exclusively in the human genome. rigorous marker selection criteria have been fundamental for performing a snp-base human identification. compared to previous reported snps selection  <cit> , here we report a much higher percentage of snps  specific for the human genome. we also recommend selecting markers located outside regions containing copy number variations. so far, the availability of several maps of copy number variations in the human genome has shown that we are genetically more diverse than expected and that our genome appears to be even more amorphous and changeable than expected. consequently, the selection of snps for human identification needs to consider all these variables in order to ensure the highest stability and reproducibility of results. during the final phases of this work, a cnv map of the human genome was published through the study of  <dig> individuals from four of the populations typed in the hapmap project. three new segmental duplications were observed within the rp11-420i <dig>  rp11-530h <dig> and rp11-469g <dig> clones which contain respectively selected markers rs <dig>  rs <dig> and rs <dig>  it is important to underline, however, that forensic markers  in current use are also located in cnv regions but no genotyping errors have been reported to date and today we do not know how many genomic regions may have cnvs because the variability of the human genome is much higher than previously supposed  <cit>  and new cnv regions are constantly being reported. despite their informative capacity and the absence of typing errors observed in this work, the use of the snps rs <dig>  rs <dig> and rs <dig> as markers for forensic purposes should be considered with caution due to the fact that typing errors arising from the complexity of the surrounding genomic regions cannot be totally excluded.
