BACKGROUND
visceral leishmaniasis  is an emerging zoonosis of great significance to public health; its geographic distribution is restricted to tropical and temperate regions  <cit> . about 90 % of the individuals infected with vl in latin america are in brazil. zoonotic vl is a potentially fatal disease and domestic dogs are considered the main epidemiologic reservoir of l. infantum  due to intense skin and viscera parasitism. it is believed that some infected dogs do not develop clinical signs and remain asymptomatic for inconsistent periods of time  <cit> . to control the spread of the disease, the brazilian ministry of health created the visceral leishmaniasis control and surveillance program , which is in charge of measures throughout the country, such as early diagnosis and treatment of human vl, identification and euthanasia of seropositive dogs, control of insect vectors, and health education  <cit> . diagnosis of canine leishmaniasis  is usually carried out using serologic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , immunochromatographic tests, indirect fluorescent antibody test , or molecular tests  <cit> . ehrlichia canis, a rickettsia microorganism transmitted by ticks, is one of the major vector-borne diseases in dogs with a worldwide distribution and is directly involved in the infection and spread of cl  <cit> .

despite the measures adopted by the vlcsp to control vl  <cit> , it is suspected that the disease is spreading fast throughout the western region of são paulo state . from  <dig>  when lutzomyia longipalpis was demonstrated in the municipality of araçatuba in the neighboring region of presidente prudente, up until  <dig>   <dig>  % of cases of canine or human transmission of vl in são paulo occurred in the western region  <cit> . our aim was to determine the prevalence of cl using different methods and the prevalence of e. canis infection in presidente prudente as well as the spatial dispersion of the disease in western são paulo state, brazil.

methods
ethical considerations
canine samples were collected with informed consent from dog owners and the project was approved by the ethics committee on the use of animals of adolfo lutz institute/pasteur institute , license number 07/ <dig> 

study design
a cross-sectional study was conducted between january  <dig> and july 2011in the city of presidente prudente, in the western region of são paulo state, brazil  and in the district of montalvão. this city is a mid-sized urban center located 560 km from the state capital, são paulo; according to the census by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics  in  <dig>  the human population was  <dig>  inhabitants. the municipality covers an area of  <dig>  km <dig> and the urban area covers  <dig>  km <dig>  the district of montalvão is located 12 km from presidente prudente city with a population of  <dig>  and an urban area of  <dig>  km <dig> and shares the same risk factors for cl . the canine population was estimated to be  <dig>  animals, with a ratio of  <dig> dogs per  <dig> ten inhabitants, according to the center for zoonosis control  in presidente prudente, linked to the municipal secretary of health. at the time of the study, the prevalence of human and canine leishmaniasis was not known in the municipality of presidente prudente. hence, minor control actions of the vlcsp were in place. the region has a typical tropical climate with a dry winter and wet summer and an average annual temperature of  <dig>  °c.

clinical examination and blood collection
the city of presidente prudente is distributed into 7 μ areas with regard to epidemiologic diseases, including dengue fever, canine vl, and human vl. in the first phase of this cross-sectional study, the canine selection took place in different regions of the city by passive demand and active searches conducted by the czc. an active search was conducted when l. longipalpis was found in a particular area of the city or when a dog was confirmed to have cl. immediately, all the households within a radius of 200 m were visited and the dogs investigated for cl. a passive search was conducted when a dogs’ owner found the symptoms described by the czc suspicious for cl. the owners of the animals enrolled in the study were interviewed by a trained research team and a questionnaire was used to provide details including address, name, gender, age, race, housing conditions, origin of the animal . in the study,  <dig> domiciled dogs of different ages and races underwent a veterinary examination by a team of  <dig> employees from the czc and were classified as asymptomatic  or symptomatic. according to the manual of surveillance and control of american visceral leishmaniasis in são paulo state  <cit> , the main clinical signs observed in symptomatic dogs included skin lesions consisting of areas of alopecia with eczematous desquamation mainly around the eyes, articulations, and skin folds, frequently followed by keratoconjunctivitis, onichogryphosis, generalized lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. slight weight loss and anemia frequently occur.

a 5-ml blood sample was collected from each animal by venipuncture for serologic testing.

follow-up studies
a follow-up study was initiated  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days after the baseline study and a total of  <dig> dogs with positive elisa were enrolled. during this period, the brazilian ministry of health introduced the dpp rapid test for the diagnosis of cl. because a limited number of dpp tests  were available, only  <dig> animals were enrolled in the follow-up. furthermore, there was a strong suspicion of a cross-reaction between cl and the serologic diagnosis of ehrlichiosis. to study this question, the municipality acquired an e. canis ifat reagent with  <dig> test samples. all dogs included in the follow-up underwent the same procedures as used in the baseline protocol plus e. canis ifat.

antibody tests
the elisa was used for the detection of anti-leishmania igg antibodies in the canine survey . the sensitivity of the eie-lvc was previously determined to be  <dig> and 100 % and the specificity was  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively  <cit> . the elisa-positive samples were later confirmed by ifat , as recommended by the brazilian ministry of health  <cit> . the sensitivity of the ifat-lvc was previously determined to be  <dig>  and 100 % and the specificity was  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively  <cit> . the rapid test for the detection of anti-leishmania igg antibodies was performed using a dual path platform  cl rapid test , according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the test uses dpp recombinant protein k <dig>  antigen, a  <dig> amino acid sequence of the cloned specific kinase region of l. infantum, which is widely used in the diagnosis of cl  <cit> . for the immunochromatographic assay, rk <dig> had a sensitivity of  <dig>  % and specificity of  <dig>  % in a previous study  <cit> .

the detection of ehrlichia canis antibodies by ifat was conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions , and serum samples, diluted at 1: <dig>  were considered positive. previous results of serological tests analyzing ifat ehrlichiosis showed 100 % sensitivity and  <dig>  % specificity  <cit> . all dogs showing positive serology on elisa and confirmed by ifat were euthanized by the veterinarian in charge in accordance with the recommendations of the vlcsp program  <cit> .

geographic expansion of l. longipalpis and cl in são paulo state
the state of são paulo has  <dig> municipalities and the health state department is divided into  <dig> mesoregions . the geographic expansion of l. longipalpis  and cl  is based on the year in which the first case was detected. data were obtained from the following brazilian public health agencies: supervision and control of epidemic ; center of regional laboratory of the adolfo lutz institute of presidente prudente v ; national system of diseases notification , são paulo epidemiological bulletin , and municipal surveillance epidemiology center . the databases for the maps were collected from the ibge website. the maps showing the spatial distribution were made using the arcgis  <dig>  platform . the concentration of positive tests in presidente prudente city and montalvão district was based on gaussian kernel. kernel density creates an output raster surface with the density of points plotted in an area. the gaussian function of kernel density is a bell-shaped function that falls off quickly toward positive and negative infinity.

statistical analysis
the proportion  of seropositive dogs  was estimated. the fisher exact test was used to compare seroprevalence across clinical groups and agreement between serological tests was assessed using kappa analysis. the kappa values were interpreted as follows: < <dig>  no agreement; 0– <dig> , poor agreement;  <dig> – <dig> , fair agreement;  <dig> – <dig> , moderate agreement;  <dig> – <dig> , substantial agreement;  <dig> – <dig> , almost perfect agreement  <cit> . significance was taken at 5 %  for a double-tailed test.

RESULTS
in the first phase of the study,  <dig> dogs were enrolled from different areas of presidente prudente and montalvão district, either by active or passive search. clinical examinations were performed and of the serum samples submitted to the elisa test for cl,  <dig>  were positive :  <dig> samples were positive by ifat, with a seroprevalence rate of  <dig>  % .fig.  <dig> seroprevalence of canine leishmaniasis and ehrlichiosis. flowchart including baseline and follow-up data, the number of samples processed by each diagnostic test, and those testing positive

discussion
in this study carried out in presidente prudente city and in the district of montalvão, the seroprevalence of cl was  <dig>  and  <dig>  % by elisa and ifat, respectively. when a follow-up was conducted,  <dig>  % were positive on elisa,  <dig>  % on ifat, and  <dig>  % in the dpp test. as far as we know, this is the first description of autochthonous cl in this region. furthermore, the disease is spreading to the border of paraná state in the southern region of brazil.

until  <dig>  vl was known in the state of são paulo only by imported cases. the first case of autochthonous cl was described in  <dig> in araçatuba, an area located about 160 km from presidente prudente, in the northwest region of the state  <cit> . thereafter, the infection spread throughout the administrative areas of bauru, marília, and são josé do rio preto. leishmaniasis has been detected in humans and dogs in the western region of são paulo state, the first in the municipality of dracena in  <dig>  considered by brazil health ministry to be an area with a high transmission rate . in são paulo state, the vector and canine and human leishmaniasis are controlled by the health secretary of são paulo state according to the manual of surveillance and control of american visceral leishmaniasis  <cit> . despite the measures adopted to control cl, the disease has spread quickly throughout the municipalities of the dracena microregion. in recent years, like a ghost projecting its shadows, the disease has reached presidente prudente county, where canine vl was found in  <dig>  <cit> .

in  <dig>  l. longipalpis and cl were found in some of the border counties of paraná state, a region with few cases of vl  <cit> . with a large road network linking different regions, small towns and increasing levels of circulating people, animals and goods, the border area of both states is changing rapidly. livestock breeding is being replaced by extensive agricultural mechanization of sugar cane plantations with aerial spraying of insecticides and herbicides. this new scenario may be slowing the burden of the disease in paraná state. this scenario is not shared in dracena and presidente prudente regions; they are notably less mechanized with predominantly areas of cattle pasture. there is a strong hypothesis that the route of expansion and dissemination of vl in the west and northwest region of são paulo state originated in bolivia  <cit> . the vector and parasite reached brazil through corumbá, on the western border of mato grosso do sul state, moving on to campo grande, in the central region and many years after the disease was found in três lagoas, on the border of andradina and dracena, western são paulo state. later, it reached bauru following the northwest railroad, marechal rondon highway, and recently, throughout the construction of the bolivia-brazil gas pipeline  <cit> .

the reasons why cl is spreading fast in the western region of são paulo and in the direction of paraná state are not well understood. with a tropical climate, dry winters and wet summers, the region consists of dozens of small towns and villages, and is historically one of the poorest regions in são paulo state. it neighbors, mato grosso do sul state and araçatuba county, are well-known endemic foci of vl in brazil. certainly the lack of control of the canine population is one probable mechanism; packs of domestic and homeless dogs wander freely in urban areas, most of them without a zoonosis/vectors control service  <cit> . an overwhelming factor is the overlapping possibility of vl and cutaneous leishmaniasis throughout the region. since  <dig>  outbreaks have occurred, mainly in the region of pontal of paranapanema  <cit> . in the present study, surprisingly, a significant number of infected dogs were found in the business district. empty areas on the map do not mean the absence of infected animals; on the contrary, it means those places were not surveyed. montalvão is a higher district of presidente prudente county. linked by a highway, there is a daily flow of people for shopping, health care, work, and education services sharing the same risk factors for cl as presidente prudente.

the cl seroprevalence of  <dig>  % is about 5-fold lower than the average rates of  <dig>  % found in the counties of dracena’s microregion, varying from  <dig>  % in monte castelo to  <dig>  and  <dig>  % in dracena and santa mercedes, respectively  <cit> . we suggest that low levels of parasites were circulating in presidente prudente city when the samples were obtained from dogs during the 2010– <dig> period, only 1 year after the vector and cl were reported. possibly, this is also the reason why high rates of discordance between the elisa and ifat methods were found. in endemic areas, with increasing rates of circulating parasites, the results between elisa and ifat tend to be closer . serological tests for leishmaniasis diagnosis, particularly in epidemiologic surveys of the active search, lack specificity and sensitivity because they are not completely purified and cross reactions may occur, mainly with canine blood-borne agents such as e. canis  <cit> . in the city, the dispersion routes of cl occurred via allochthones dogs coming from surrounding endemic counties. worldwide, in urban areas, the domestic dog is the main source of infection for the vector. they exhibit intense cutaneous parasitism, which allows easy infection from sandflies, and the maintenance of the epidemiologic cycle of transmission  <cit> .

with an interval of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days,  <dig> elisa-positive dogs in the baseline study were re-tested and  <dig>  were positive in elisa,  <dig>  were confirmed in ifat, and  <dig>  were positive in the dpp test. an array of factors may be involved in the 3-fold reduction in the rate of elisa-positive dogs in the follow-up compared with the baseline study. in a scenario of low endemicity, few parasites are in circulation, reducing the burden of infection; healthy animals may clear the parasite via a cell-mediated and humoral immune response resulting in low antibody concentration with negative or borderline titres at the follow-up. e. canis/ifat showed a seroprevalence of  <dig>  and  <dig>  % in the animals with leishmaniasis/ehrlichiosis co-infection. furthermore, significant levels of dogs infected with e. canis were found compared with cl, confirming the suspicions of the veterinarian team of the czc in presidente prudente. occurring in a wide geographic distribution, especially in tropical and subtropical areas, e. canis infection has a role in increasing susceptibility and making the clearance of l. infantum  difficult  <cit> . however, there are conflicting results on the role of e. canis in the cross-reaction of the serologic diagnosis of cl due to lack of specificity  <cit> . our results demonstrate that canine ehrlichiosis was an important differential diagnosis of cl because of the prevalence of co-infected dogs. in areas of low cl endemicity, this aspect must be considered by clinicians; symptomatic dogs can be falsely diagnosed with cl and euthanized  <cit> . no data on the seroprevalence of ehrlichiosis were found in the region.

the association between dpp positive results and the presence of active clinical disease in both humans and dogs is well known  <cit> . in acute vl, the host may produce specific antibodies against replicating leishmania. dpp antigens occur predominantly on amastigotes  and not in promastigotes  <cit> . in brazil, until  <dig>  cl was diagnosed using ifat to confirm positive cases detected by elisa. after  <dig>  the dpp cl rapid test was introduced for screening with elisa as a confirmatory test  <cit> .

in the follow-up,  <dig>  % of the animals were classified as symptomatic after clinical examination. these dogs did not originate from the passive or active search and they are not a representative sample for estimating cl.

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here allow us to conclude that low cl, suggesting low circulation of parasites and high prevalence rates of ehrlichiosis, were found in presidente prudente city. a cross-reaction between l. infantum  and e. canis antibodies may have occurred. cl is moving through the western counties of são paulo state toward the border of paraná state. hence, implementation of integrated actions to fight the vector and the parasite, as well as the early diagnosis of dogs and humans, are needed for effective monitoring of the disease; in addition, strategies for epidemiologic control must be implemented.
