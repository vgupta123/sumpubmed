BACKGROUND
most known organisms synthesize purine bases by two pathways. the de novo biosynthesis pathway builds the purine nucleotide on 5-phosphoribosyl-alpha-1-pyrophosphate . the salvage pathway recovers purines  from the degradation products of nucleotide metabolism and from hypoxanthine and xanthine. in contrast, parasitic protozoa such as the members of the kinetoplastida order are auxotrophs for purine bases because the de novo biosynthetic pathway is completely absent  <cit> . they are therefore dependent on recycling pre-formed purine nucleotides and acquiring purines from the host. central to the salvage pathway are the phosphoribosyltransferases . in kinetoplastids in general and leishmania in particular, three prtases are involved in the recycling of purine bases by the salvage pathway: hypoxanthine-guanine prtase  , adenine prtase   and xanthine prtase    <cit> . several prtases have been characterized from different organisms, but crystallization and structure determination have been accomplished for only two hgprts from kinetoplastids, the parasite trypanosoma cruzi  <cit>  and l. tarentolae .

prtases are classified as type i and type ii depending on their structural and catalytic features. the best-studied prtases belong to the 'type i' group, sharing a common α/β-fold at the prpp binding motif and a flexible loop, besides a core region of at least five parallel β-strands surrounded by three or more helices  <cit> . the 'type ii' prtases are composed of a mixed α/β n-terminal domain and an α/β barrel-like c-terminal domain. currently, mycobacterium tuberculosis and salmonella typhimurium quinolinate prtases are the only known structures in this group  <cit> .

considerable interest in the salvage pathway as a potential target for chemotherapy has been stimulated by the differences in purine base metabolism between mammalian hosts and protozoan parasites  <cit> . the creation of independent Δhgprt, Δaprt and Δxprt null mutants by targeted gene replacement in l. donovani cells revealed that all three of the knockout strains generated are viable in the mouse macrophage model  <cit> . however, the Δhgprt/Δxprt double mutant l. donovani strain has less than 5% of the wild-type capacity to infect macrophages, establishing hgprt and xprt as essential for purine acquisition, parasite viability and infectivity in the mouse model  <cit> .

l. tarentolae has been exploited as a model leishmania for a variety of molecular, biochemical and evolutionary studies because of the ease of cell culture and genetic analysis of this species. in this paper we describe the three-dimensional structure of a l. tarentolae hgprt protein and compare it with other hgprt structures deposited in the protein data bank. in view of the close phylogenetic relationship, the results will be of general significance as a model for other species of pathogenic leishmania.

RESULTS
general description
the refined crystallographic model of the dimeric hgprt from l. tarentolae  includes two protein monomers  in the asymmetric unit, with one molecule of gmp bound to the active site of each monomer. as summarized in table  <dig>  the overall quality of the model is good. the n-terminal regions , the active site flexible loops , and the c-terminal regions  containing a glycosome target sequence, are absent from the model, since they could not be located by inspection of the experimental electron density maps.

the monomer structure
leishmania hgprt is an α/β protein with the known prtase type i fold. it is composed of two domains: a core domain containing the prpp binding site  <cit> , and a hood domain that binds the purine base substrate .

the core domain consists of a central five-stranded parallel β-sheet , with one α-helix packed on each side of the sheet . a small  <dig> – helix  is present in the core domain. the central β-sheet is formed by two β/α/β motifs joined side-by-side through the first strand of each motif . one further strand  completes the central β-sheet. a phosphate binding site is present in the loops between the first β-strand and the α-helix of the β/α/β motif . loops i and iii are involved in binding the two terminal phosphates of prpp  <cit> . l. tarentolae hgprt loop iii residues asp <dig>  ser <dig>  ala <dig> and thr <dig> interact with the gmp phosphate group.

a flexible loop , the function of which may be related to the formation of the transition state  <cit> , comprises a region  with good stereochemical and statistical values, which adopts different conformations in the two chains. in chain b, the polypeptide partially forms an α-helix  similar to that in human hgprt  <cit> , while in chain a this helix is not observed and the polypeptide conformation resembles that found in t. cruzi hgprt  <cit> , tritrichomonas foetus hgxprt  <cit>  and e. coli hprt  <cit> . the different conformations adopted by these residues in the two monomers are consistent with the flexibility generally observed in the equivalent region  of other hgprtases.

the hood domain contains both the n- and c-termini and is constituted by a small anti-parallel β-sheet with three strands . a loop  connects the β-strand β <dig> in the core domain to β <dig> in the hood-domain. this loop  contains some of the residues that bind the base of gmp by hydrogen bonding with val <dig> and asp <dig> and by hydrophobic interaction with phe <dig>  the other connection between the core and the hood domain is made by a long α-helix , which ends with a small  <dig> – helix . this helix appears to be important for the structural stability of hgprt, since it interacts with all strands of the central β-sheet and with helix α <dig> of the core domain and is also involved in dimerization contacts.

the dimeric interface
the dimerization interface of leishmania hgprt, shown in figure  <dig>  is stabilized by a complex network of  <dig> non-bonded contacts and  <dig> hydrogen bonds involving  <dig> residues from dimer a and  <dig> from dimer b. most of these residues are located in helix α <dig> and loop iv. the  <dig> hydrogen bonds are formed between lys <dig>  and val <dig> , glu <dig>  and val <dig>  and between residues asp <dig> and arg <dig> , asp <dig> , arg <dig> , asp <dig> and glu <dig> . asp <dig> and glu <dig> form intra-subunit h-bonds with tyr <dig> and arg <dig> , respectively . we observed a similar network of interactions in the t. cruzi  <cit> , t. foetus  <cit>  and e. coli  <cit>  homologues.

residues of the dimerization region are also involved in stabilizing the active site, particularly arg <dig>  and lys <dig>  , suggesting a structural explanation for the fact that leishmania hgprt has been found exclusively as a dimer in both the presence and the absence of gmp  <cit> . the dimerization of hgprt is an important step in the organization of loops i and iv. this is supported by mutants of the interface region in plasmodium falciparum  <cit>  and t. cruzi  <cit> , which show drastically reduced catalytic activity.

structural water molecules in each monomer  stabilize the polar side chains of thr <dig> and tyr <dig> by hydrogen bonds that are found in a hydrophobic region formed by the trp <dig>  val <dig>  phe <dig> and phe <dig> side chains. moreover, thr <dig> and tyr <dig> in both leishmania and human hgprt form hydrogen bonds to neighboring val <dig> and asp <dig>  respectively. this water molecule stabilization is exclusively observed in the leishmania structure; in homologous structures, thr <dig> is substituted by a hydrophobic residue.

comparison of hgprt structures
the known hgprt structures of e. coli, s. typhimurium, thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis, t. foetus, t. cruzi, p. falciparum, toxoplasma gondii and the human enzyme were compared with l. tarentolae hgprt. the sequences were aligned  and the structures superposed.

a non-proline cis peptide bond between leu <dig> and lys <dig> from loop i is conserved in type i prtases  <cit> , where the amide nitrogen of lys <dig> is exposed to the active site so that the peptide bond contributes two adjacent hydrogen bonds to the prpp-metal complex  <cit> . however, our structural comparison of hgprts  suggests that the lys <dig> cis conformation acts in the communication between monomers and drives the arg <dig> side chain toward the active site into the correct position to bind ppi . structures with a cis conformation in complex with prpp as well as with ppi give strong evidence for this  <cit> .

loop iv is conserved among the hgprts and interacts with the reaction product gmp through hydrogen bonds  as well as aromatic π-π stacking interactions . an important contribution to the stabilization of gmp comes from lys <dig> in strand β <dig>  which makes two hydrogen bonds with the nitrogen base  . the two additional hydrogen bonds from lys <dig> can be important in stabilizing the gmp in the active site if only three hydrogen bonds are formed between the nitrogen base and loop iv. moreover, lys <dig> forms hydrogen bonds with ala <dig>  allowing loop iv to be properly positioned to interact with the base of gmp. three other residues are conserved in the hgprt structures: gly <dig> and asp <dig> are involved in mg2+ binding and arg <dig> is involved in prpp or ppi binding  <cit> .

three distinct hgprt structural groups can be identified, mainly on the basis of the different sizes of helix α <dig> in the core domain and the c and n-terminus sequences of the hood domain :  the group comprising s. typhimurium, e. coli, t. tengcongensis and t. foetus, which have the shortest helices;  the trypanosomatids group ; and  the p. falciparum, t. gondii and human group, which have the longest helices.

the main differences between the leishmania and human enzymes are found in the interactions between the gmp base and ribose and residues in the active site. regarding the gmp base, we observe that in human hgprt the n <dig> atom contacts both the oxygen and the carbonyl groups of val <dig> and asp <dig> , and the o <dig> atom forms a hydrogen bond with the nz atom of lys <dig>  in contrast, the n <dig> atom of the gmp base in leishmania hgprt interacts preferentially with asp <dig>  and the lys <dig> nz atom interacts with both o <dig> and n <dig> of the base. the interaction distances are shown in table  <dig>  the cα superposed in  <dig> residues interacting with gmp in the active site of leishmania and human hgprt result in an rmsd of  <dig> Å. this analysis shows that residues from loop iv have the largest rmsd and the guanine base shows a subtle orientation shift in this region between the two hgprts , particularly residues asp <dig> and asp <dig>  the ribose of gmp in both the human and leishmania enzymes is in the c3'-endo conformation used in the analysis of the bound gmp. in human hgprt, the o <dig> atom of the ribose forms a hydrogen bond with oe <dig> of glu <dig>  while this hydrogen bond in leishmania is formed with od <dig> of asp <dig>  these differences are the result of the c5* atom arrangements , modifying the ribose position in the active site. according to our comparisons, the leishmania hgprt ribose is better stabilized by those interactions than the human ribose .

leishmania hgprt inhibition tests
purine and pyrimidine analogs obtained from commercial sources were used to test the leishmania hgprt for possible inhibitors. all compounds tested resulted in high ic <dig> values, 8-aminoguanosine showing the best result . one compound in particular, the antibiotic cefatoxime, has an ic <dig> value similar to allopurinol .

hgprt is a known activator of purine base analogs such as 6-mercaptopurine and allopurinol, and has been proposed as a target for antiparasitic chemotherapy  <cit> . allopurinol is metabolized by hgprt and incorporated into rna during transcription, resulting in its degradation and inhibition of protein synthesis  <cit> . allopurinol is metabolized more efficiently by the parasite hgprt than the human homologue  <cit> , prompting its evaluation in the treatment of leishmaniasis  <cit>  and chagas disease  <cit>  with promising results.

the purine and pyrimidine analogs tested against leishmania hgprt present values in the high micromolar range . allopurinol in particular has an ic <dig> of approximately  <dig>  mm and is a more potent inhibitor of leishmania than of t. cruzi hgprt  <cit> . in the analysis of t. cruzi and human hgprt with hpp  bound to the active site  <cit> , subtle differences were observed in the binding that may be significant for novel compound design  <cit> . the superposition of hpp-bound active sites of t. cruzi and human hgprt with gmp-bound leishmania hgprt showed that the guanine in the leishmania structure is located in the same position as hpp in the homologous structures, with subtle differences that are more pronounced when the human and leishmania homologues are compared . the differences between human and leishmania hgprt, like those in the gmp binding residues, as well as the gmp orientation and h-bond patterns in the active site, suggest that potential inhibitors may affect the protozoan enzyme differently from human hgprt. this observation is supported by the high efficiency of incorporation of allopurinol by the leishmania and trypanosoma enzymes compared to human hgprt.

CONCLUSIONS
the x-ray structure of l. tarentolae hgprt with gmp bound at the active site provides the template for comparison with the human enzyme. the subtle differences observed between the parasite and the human enzyme in the contacts with ligand can be explored for the design of potential parasite-specific inhibitors. the dimeric structure of l. tarentolae hgprt shows an intricate hydrogen bond network important for enzyme stability and required for its activity. this analysis, together with the inhibition experiments using purine and pyrimidine analogs, has revealed differences in the binding efficiency of the enzyme active site that could be explored in the development of further inhibitors.
