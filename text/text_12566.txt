BACKGROUND
wolbachia is a maternal transmitted endosymbiont that infect about 40% of all arthropod species as well as many filarial nematode species and has profound effects on host biology  <cit> . wolbachia manipulates host reproductive systems through a variety of strategies, including cytoplasmic incompatibility , male killing, feminization, and parthenogenesis  <cit> . in some cases, wolbachia can also provide benefits  <cit>  and develop mutualistic relationships with their hosts  <cit> . however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the above wolbachia-mediated phenotypes in hosts.

micrornas  are endogenous non-coding small rnas  that play significant roles in regulating a range of cellular processes, including development, differentiation, apoptosis, and immunity . originally, mirnas were considered to control gene expression post-transcriptionally by repressing mrna translation or degrading mrna in the cytoplasm  <cit> . recently, mirnas was observed to induce gene expression  <cit>  and even regulate pre-mrna processing in the nucleus, which has a significant role in transcriptional gene silencing . to date, more than  <dig>  mirnas from over  <dig> organisms, including two ticks and one mite, have been discovered and deposited in mirna database   <cit> .

recent studies have shown that mirnas are important players in response to bacterial and viral infections in animals and plants  <cit> . in the mosquito aedes aegypti, the wmelpop-cla strain of wolbachia significantly alters the mirna profile of a. aegypti, thereby manipulating a broad array of host genes to facilitate self-maintenance . these observations indicate that host mirnas may play essential role in wolbachia-host interactions.

the two-spotted spider mite tetranychus urticae is a cosmopolitan agricultural pest that feeds on hundreds of plant species  <cit> . we previously demonstrated that wolbachia induces strong ci and increases host fecundity in t. urticae
 <cit> . in order to explore whether and how host mirnas are involved in t. urticae-wolbachia interactions, we constructed four small rna  libraries representing female mites infected  and uninfected  with wolbachia, and male mites infected  and uninfected  with wolbachia. these libraries also offer the opportunity to identify protein-encoding genes that were differentially expressed in response to wolbachia infection. by integrating the mirna and mrna data, the target genes of the differentially expressed mirnas were identified. furthermore, several altered mirnas associated with reproduction were analyzed. our results provide new insights on how wolbachia affects its hosts through mediating host mirnas.

RESULTS
identification of known and novel mirnas in t. urticae
four srna libraries were constructed with a total of about  <dig> million raw reads. after sequencing process,  <dig> million clean reads were generated . about 80% of the srnas were in the range 18-25nt and the peak sizes were 21nt for the fi and fu libraries and 22nt for the mi and mu libraries . the srnas were divided into ten classes, such as known mirnas, novel mirnas and trnas . the percentages of known and novel mirnas were highest in the mu library , but lowest in the fi library .table  <dig>

a total of  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified in the four libraries . most of the predicted novel mirnas had the guide strand retained and lost the passenger strand  , so only the guide strand of a novel mirna was analyzed further in this study. these novel mirnas showed all characteristic signatures of a mirna as described previously  <cit> . the predicted secondary structures of nine novel mirnas were shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  about 45% of novel mirnas were 25nt and 77% of the novel mirnas were below  <dig> readcount . according to mifam.dat  and rfam  <cit> , forty conserved mirnas and five novel mirnas  were classified into  <dig> mirna families .

there were significant overlaps on identified mirna between different groups . specifically,  <dig> mirnas were identified in female libraries. among them,  <dig> mirnas were detected only in fi and  <dig> mirnas were found only in fu, while  <dig> mirnas were found in both libraries .  <dig> mirnas were identified in the male libraries, with  <dig> mirnas shared by mi and mu libraries. similar to the observation that less mirnas present in fi than fu, the mi and mu libraries had  <dig> and  <dig> library-specific mirnas, respectively . these results indicate that the presence of wolbachia may inhibit the synthesis of mirnas in both female and male mites.figure  <dig>

expression analysis of wolbachia-responsive mirnas
in females,  <dig> mirnas were observed to be up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated in the wolbachia-infected line compared to the wolbachia-uninfected line , while  <dig> mirnas were up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated in the wolbachia-infected line in males . among the up-regulated mirnas, tur-mir-1-5p and tur-mir-2-3p were strongly expressed in mi and fi, respectively, while they were not among the top  <dig> mirnas in mu and fu . tur-mir-2-3p belongs to the mir- <dig> mirna family, which is widespread in invertebrates, and is the largest family of mirnas in the model species drosophila melanogaster
 <cit> . based on their predicted targets, mir- <dig> mirnas have been suggested to have a role in neural development and maintenance  <cit> . leaman et al.
 <cit>  showed that the mir- <dig> family regulates cell survival by translational repression of proapoptotic factors. thus, the up-regulation of tur-mir-2-3p in wolbachia-infected females may be related to changes in neural or apoptotic processes.figure  <dig>

thirteen differentially expressed mirnas were common between the female and male . among them, novel_ <dig> was up-regulated in wolbachia-infected males but down-regulated in wolbachia-infected females . four other mirnas were up-regulated in wolbachia-infected lines, and eight mirnas were down-regulated in wolbachia-infected lines . interestingly, novel_ <dig>  novel_ <dig> and novel_ <dig> were detected only in wolbachia-uninfected females . similarly, novel_ <dig>  novel_ <dig>  novel_ <dig>  novel_ <dig> and novel_ <dig> were found only in wolbachia-uninfected males .table  <dig>

we also identified  <dig> female-specific differentially expressed mirnas, including  <dig> substantially  down-regulated mirnas and  <dig> substantially up-regulated mirnas  . in wolbachia-infected females, the most down-regulated mirna was novel_ <dig>  which had a log <dig>  value of  <dig> . in contrast, novel_ <dig> was most up-regulated with a log <dig>  value of  <dig>  . furthermore, several mirnas like novel_ <dig>  novel_ <dig>  novel_ <dig>  novel_ <dig> and tur-mir-5729a-3p were found only in infected females .

mirna expression patterns
to further validate the expression patterns of mirnas identified in this work, we measured the expression levels of nine differential mirnas  shared by the female and male and five female-specific differential mirnas  using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction . except for novel_ <dig>  all other  <dig> mirnas were significantly  down-regulated in wolbachia-infected female and male lines, which was in agreement with our sequencing data . novel_ <dig>  novel_ <dig>  novel_ <dig> and novel_ <dig> were decreased by more than five times . three of the five female-specific differential mirnas were significantly down-regulated in infected females, which was consistent with our sequencing data . as a whole, these results supported that the illumina sequencing data accurately reflected the abundance of the mirnas.figure  <dig>

target gene prediction of differentially expressed mirnas
to further determine the biological functions of the differentially expressed mirnas, we integrated the mirna and the mrna transcriptome data to predict the candidate target genes. at first, miranda was used to predict the target genes of the  <dig> mirnas, which resulted in the identification of  <dig>  mirna-target pairs. then, the predicted target genes of differentially expressed mirnas were aligned with differentially expressed mrnas. this approach revealed possible interactions between  <dig> mrnas and  <dig> mirnas in the female comparison , and between  <dig> mrnas and  <dig> mirnas in the male comparison . in addition,  <dig> differential mirnas found in the female comparison were predicted to negatively regulate  <dig> candidate target genes . while in the male comparison,  <dig> candidate target genes were suggested to be negatively regulated by the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas .

the biological functions of the predicted target genes were then analyzed using the gene ontology  annotations of the t. urticae genes. the go annotation enrichment results showed that genes related to binding, catalytic activity, and metabolic and cellular processes were most enriched in the two comparisons . in both female and male mites, gos corresponding to the up-regulated genes included establishment of localization, membrane and transporter activity . however, several gos, such as death, enzyme regulator activity and structural molecular activity, were exclusively enriched in the female mites .

pathway analysis resulted in observation of  <dig> and  <dig> different pathways corresponded to the differentially expressed genes in the female and male comparison, respectively. notably, the five kegg pathways  and their related three candidate genes  of the male comparison were also highlighted in the female comparison. the  <dig> most enriched kegg pathways of females included the degradation of valine, leucine and isoleucine, phenylalanine metabolism, lysosome function and so on . the target gene tetur09g <dig> was the only enriched gene in both female’s and male’s kegg pathways which may be negatively regulated by a differential mirna . sequencing and qrt-pcr results showed that tetur09g <dig> was up-regulated in both infected female and male mites . the up-regulation of tetur09g <dig> indicated that novel_ <dig> potentially represses the expression of this gene.figure  <dig>

wolbachia-responsive mirnas are related to regulation of apoptosis in mites of both sexes
the target genes that may be negatively regulated by the  <dig> common differentially expressed mirnas in the female and male comparisons were presented in table  <dig>  in general, the target genes of some mirnas revealed multiply. despite the similarities in mirnas regulation, we found that only novel_ <dig> and novel_ <dig> targeted the same genes in both comparisons . the mirna novel_ <dig> targets two genes potentially associated with apoptosis: tetur09g <dig> encoding glucosylceramidase and tetur26g <dig> encoding protein lifeguard  <dig>  which were up-regulated in wolbachia infected mites with more than 4-fold . the gene tetur09g <dig> is involved in several kegg pathways, including lysosome function, sphingolipid metabolism and glycan degradation . deficiency of gcase causes several diseases in mice, including severe neurodegeneration and apoptosis in the brain  <cit> . therefore, the observed up-regulation of tetur <dig> in both infected lines may indicate its role in inhibiting apoptosis. moreover, some other mirnas, such as novel_ <dig> , novel_ <dig> , novel_ <dig> , novel_ <dig> , may also regulate apoptosis . the expression level of tetur03g <dig>  encoding protein lethal  essential for life, was elevated in wolbachia-infected females. previous studies have proved that wolbachia can inhibit apoptosis in several ways. for example, wolbachia surface protein  inhibits apoptosis of polymorphonuclear  cells in vitro
 <cit> . in the parasitic wasp asobara tabida, wolbachia helps its host to avoid becoming reproductively sterile by repressing massive apoptosis of nurse cells in the ovary  <cit> . similarly, wolbachia infection leads to a decrease in programmed cell death in the germarium of d. mauritiana
 <cit> . however, a virulent wolbachia strain wmelpop increase the frequency of apoptosis in the female drosophila
 <cit> . regardless of the strategy that wolbachia uses to interfere with host, the apoptosis inhibition will in turn benefit to maintenance of wolbachia itself. the down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic mirnas  reinforces the importance of investigating the apoptotic signaling cascade upon wolbachia infection .

wolbachia-responsive mirnas may regulate reproduction in female mites
since wolbachia causes strong ci in this spider mite population, an important aim of our study was to clarify the underlying mechanism of wolbachia-induced ci. some remarkable features observed in ci embryos include delayed paternal nuclear envelope breakdown and activation of cdk <dig>  <cit> , a failure of the maternal histones h <dig>  to deposit in the paternal genome, and slowed replication of sperm dna  <cit> . in this study, we found several target genes that may be related to females’ reproduction. for instance, target gene tetur13g <dig>  codes for histone h2b was induced by  <dig> -fold in wolbachia-infected females . histone play important roles in transcription regulation, dna repair, dna replication and chromosomal stability  <cit> . target gene tetur11g <dig> of novel_ <dig> was exclusively expressed in wolbachia-uninfected females , which codes for meiosis arrest female protein  <dig> and involved in oogenesis . target gene tetur11g <dig> and tetur01g <dig>  code for cuticle protein, which may be related to egg formation . in addition, target gene tetur04g <dig>  codes for sorbitol dehydrogenase, an enzyme which possibly play a role in sperm motility by providing a source of energy for sperm  <cit>  . taken together, it supports the hypothesis that wolbachia can manipulate female mites’ reproduction via host mirnas and further studies are needed to test this hypothesis.

other function genes mediated by wolbachia-responsive mirnas
among the seven male-specific differential mirnas, only two had target genes with description . the target gene exclusively found in the male comparison was tetur09g <dig> , which codes for multidrug resistance-associated protein  <dig> . the target gene of tur-mir-9-3p  codes for apolipoprotein d, which is related to lipid transporting. we also found target genes related to drug resistance  and apolipophorins biogenesis  were up-regulated in the infected females , which indicated that these two biological processes may be regulated by different mirna-target pairs in the female and male mites. apolipophorins may be up-regulated in female mites because they are essential for reproduction, but they may also be up-regulated by wolbachia because wolbachia needs them to produce lipopolysaccharide, the major component of its outer membrane  <cit> . another observation worth to note here was that wolbachia also enhances the expression of the genes that codes for riboflavin transporter in female mites . riboflavin that wolbachia provided to nematodes was found to be crucial for worm health and fertility , and in cultured mosquito cells, depletion of host cell riboflavin decreased wolbachia abundance  <cit> . taken together, these results raise the possibility that wolbachia and t. urticae have a symbiotic relationship.

sex-specific interaction mechanisms
the divergences of the differentially expressed mirnas and target genes found in the female and male comparisons suggest that wolbachia used different strategies to regulate mirna and mrna in females and males. we previously showed that wolbachia mainly localized in the ovary of female mites and its density increased during the reproduction process  <cit> . in contrast, the density of wolbachia in male mites decreased with age  <cit> . these phenomena indicated that wolbachia replicate massively in female reproductive tissues to ensure its successful vertical transmission. in the present study, wolbachia infection led to the down-regulation of 65% of the differential mirnas and up-regulation of 69% of the predicted target genes in the female mites . go analysis showed that the up-regulate genes were related to establishment of localization, membrane, structural molecular activity and transporter activity , which also suggested that wolbachia replication is increasing in young females. besides wolbachia replication, the reproductive tissues of female mites probably experience high metabolic activity during egg production. that could be two reasons why there are more specific- and up- regulated mrnas in females. some studies suggested that wolbachia interacts with female hosts in a broader manner than it does with male hosts. in some cases, wolbachia acts as an obligate mutualism, i.e., it is required for normal reproduction of the host  <cit> . in other cases, wolbachia was found to benefit to its female host by increasing fecundity  <cit> . sex-specific regulations of mirnas were also found in flour beetles, in which  <dig>  of the mirnas exhibited gender-specific expression patterns upon exposure to environmental stress  <cit> . this discrepancy in gender- specific mirna expression is consistent with bateman’s principle, which states that males gain fitness by increasing their mating success whereas females gain fitness through increasing longevity because their reproductive effort is higher  <cit> . if the female and male mites gain fitness through different ways following wolbachia infection, the expression of mirnas and mrnas may be diversely influenced.

CONCLUSIONS
four libraries of young female and male mites with and without wolbachia infection, were constructed, amplified and sequenced. as a result, we detected  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas exhibiting differential expression in response to wolbachia infection in female and male mites, respectively. there was an overall decrease of mirnas in wolbachia-infected lines. integrating the mirna and mrna data uncovered many target genes, and enabled us to develop new hypotheses for wolbachia-regulated reproduction and apoptosis mechanisms. the discovery of these wolbachia-responsive mirnas and their target genes provides a basis for understanding wolbachia-host interaction in a ci phenotype host. in addition, we described a complex interaction network of mirnas and target mrnas that will encourage future studies to examine the contribution of the specific newly identified mirnas on the regulation of biological processes in response to wolbachia infection in more detail.

eventually, this study reports the discovery of sexually differentially expressed mirnas and mirna- target gene pairs. wolbachia appears to affect a large number of cellular processes in female mites. those findings lay the foundation for future studies to identify mirnas or genes responsible for not only the wolbachia maintenance, but also the sexually host-endosymbiont interaction mechanism.
