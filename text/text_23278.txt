BACKGROUND
association studies provide an alternative to conventional family-based methods for detecting the genomic location of genes or quantitative trait loci . while both rely on the correlation between dna marker alleles and the phenotypic expression of a trait of interest, association studies can provide relatively higher resolution in terms of defining the genomic position of a gene or qtl, since it can be applied to naturally occurring populations such as human populations or germplasm collections. the important difference between the degree of qtl detection possible with these natural populations and that possible with progeny derived from crosses between two individuals is the level of linkage disequilibrium .

ld is the non-random association of alleles at different loci in a population. the detection of genes or qtl depends on the level of ld between a causal mutation and physically linked markers. the higher the degree of association between marker alleles and the phenotypic variants, the greater the likelihood that the phenotypic causal mutation is physically linked to the marker. a confounding factor that influences the success of association study is the presence of population structure. population structure is the result of allele frequency differences between different populations that arise as a result of population history. factors such as selection, migration, local adaptation, geographical isolation, or genetic drift can result in population structure. it is well known that population structure can cause spurious associations between markers and the trait under study  <cit> , because of allele frequency differences between subpopulations in a population, rather than genuine genetic associations with the trait of interest.

owing to the lack of sufficient numbers of dna markers, early association studies in plant species used the candidate gene approach to identify specific single nucleotide polymorphisms  or genes controlling a phenotypic trait of interest such as, flowering time  <cit> , endosperm color  <cit>  and kernel starch biosynthesis  <cit>  in maize , enzymatic discoloration in potato   <cit> , flowering time in sorghum   <cit> , and aluminum tolerance in triticale   <cit> . however, the availability of high throughput dna sequencing and genotyping technologies has provided a platform for conducting genome-wide association studies . such studies have verified the location of loci associated with frost tolerance in barley   <cit> ; leaf architecture  <cit> ; southern leaf blight  <cit> , and waterlogging tolerance  <cit>  in maize ; agronomic traits in rice   <cit> ; flowering time  <cit>  and defense metabolites  <cit>  in arabidopsis  and plant architecture and flowering time in sunflower  <cit> . in soybean , a gwas was performed to detect genes/markers associated with iron deficiency chlorosis  <cit>  and chlorophyll and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters  <cit> .

seed protein and oil content in soybean are quantitatively inherited traits determined by the interaction of a number of genes subject to genotype × environment interactions. many seed protein and oil qtl have been reported in a number of studies over the past two decades . these qtl, identified using linkage analysis of populations derived from crosses of two parents with contrasting seed protein and oil concentration, have been detected in many different genomic regions throughout all  <dig> chromosomes. several of these qtl have been identified three or more times at identical or very similar chromosomal positions in different populations, which suggests that these qtl are not likely false positives. because these regions likely contain a gene or genes with relatively large genetic effects on seed protein and oil content, their re-identification in a gwas targeted at seed protein and oil would provide a measure of the success of gwas in an independent test of its ability to detect the presence of seed protein and oil qtl.

in the research reported here, the degree of ld was assessed in  <dig> soybean germplasm accessions obtained from the usda soybean germplasm collection. seed protein and oil concentration were measured in seeds harvested from plants grown in replicated field trials at two locations. the resulting seed composition data were used to evaluate the gwas approach, and ultimately to provide an assessment of the likely success of gwas when it is used to detect the qtl controlling the two well-known soybean quantitative traits–seed protein and oil content.

RESULTS
linkage disequilibrium in euchromatic and heterochromatic genome regions
a total of  <dig>  snps distributed across the soybean genome with minor allele frequency > <dig>  and missing data of less than 25% was used for the estimation of ld level in the  <dig> soybean germplasm accessions. these snp markers spanned  <dig>  mbp, which represents approximately  <dig> % of the  <dig>  gbp soybean genome, resulting in an average snp density of  <dig> snp every  <dig>  kbp in euchromatic regions and  <dig> snp every  <dig>  kbp in heterochromatic regions. in euchromatic regions, the mean level of ld measured by d’ declined very rapidly to  <dig>  within  <dig> kbp, and mean ld as measured by r
2
 dropped sharply to  <dig>  at  <dig> kbp . however, in heterochromatic regions, the mean value of d’ remained greater than  <dig>  until about  <dig>  kbp and mean ld as measured by r
2
 did not decline to  <dig>  until about  <dig>  kbp .

population structure
a total of  <dig>  snps positioned on the  <dig> soybean chromosomes was used to estimate the most likely number  of subgroups in the  <dig> germplasm accessions. the most likely k value was k =  <dig>  the accessions within seven subgroups originated from a single asian country and the other nine subgroups were comprised of a mix of accessions from different countries. in terms of maturity group, eight subgroups consisted of accessions with the same maturity group, whereas the other eight subgroups were a mix of accessions of different maturity groups.

seed protein and oil phenotypes
the germplasm accessions were selected based upon data in the usda germplasm resources information network  database , to represent two distinct groups–one group with normal seed protein content  and the other with high seed protein content . however, seed protein content measured in seeds grown in replicated hill-plot trials at beltsville, md and lincoln, ne showed continuous variation with a range from  <dig> to 50% . experimental error was low in each trial, given the coefficient of variation  values of  <dig> % in the md experiment and  <dig> % in the ne experiment, with an overall cv of  <dig> % in the 2-location analysis. the analysis of variance indicated that the accessions differed significantly  in seed protein content, and no significant interaction between accessions and locations was detected . the correlation coefficient  of seed protein concentration between the md and ne experiments was quite high, r =  <dig>  . the correlation of the accession mean seed protein measured in the ne and md experiments with the grin accession protein value was moderate, r =  <dig>   and r =  <dig>  , respectively. the seed oil content of the accessions displayed a pattern similar to the seed protein content relative to the grin oil values . the analysis of variance for seed oil revealed that accessions were significantly different  and as was the case with protein, there was no significant accession × location interaction for oil . the correlation of accession seed oil content between the two locations was high, r =  <dig>  , but was only moderately high, r =  <dig>   and r =  <dig>  , between the grin accession values and those measured at the ne and md locations, respectively. the correlation between mean seed protein and oil contents in the md experiment and in the ne experiment were r = - <dig>  and r = - <dig> , respectively. the heritability of seed protein and seed oil concentrations was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. such heritability values are higher than would be typical in breeding studies.

genome-wide association study for the genes controlling seed protein and oil concentration
a gwas was performed with the mixed linear model  which greatly reduced false positive rates as shown in quantile-quantile plots . the results of the genome-wide association study for seed protein content are presented in figure 3a. a significant association  with seed protein concentration was observed for  <dig> snps located in  <dig> different genomic regions in  <dig> of the  <dig> chromosomes . nine of the  <dig> regions had more than two markers with significant association and the physical distance between markers ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> ,908 bp. more than a quarter  of these  <dig> snps had physical positions in the  <dig> - <dig>  mbp segment of gm <dig>  all of which were in complete ld as indicated by d’ . of the  <dig> snps, five snps in the  <dig> - <dig>  mbp segment of gm <dig> exhibited the highest association with seed protein content. this is not surprising given the fact that this is a heterochromatic region with very extensive ld, while the  <dig> other markers with significant association to protein content were located in euchromatic regions where the mean level of ld declines very rapidly. a significant association with seed oil content was detected for  <dig> snps, and these were physically located in  <dig> regions on  <dig> of the  <dig> chromosomes  where seven regions included more than two markers with the distance between markers ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp. all of these markers were located in euchromatic regions, except the four markers located on gm <dig>  the snp showing the highest association with oil  was located at the  <dig>  mbp position on gm <dig>  there were seven markers from three regions on gm <dig>  gm <dig>  and gm <dig> associated with both protein and oil seed content . at six of these seven marker loci there was a negative relationship between the protein effect versus that on oil i.e., the allele associated with increased protein content was always associated with decreased oil content or vice versa. the aforementioned snp at the  <dig>  mbp position on gm <dig> was the exception–one allele was associated with increased protein and oil content and the alternative allele with both lower protein and oil content.

a negative relationship indicates that the allele associated with greater protein content was associated with reduced oil content and vice versa. a positive relationship indicates that the allele associated with greater protein content was also associated with greater oil content and the alternative allele was associated with both reduced protein and oil content.

discussion
soybean germplasm accessions used in this study that include landraces collected in china, korea, and japan over a  <dig> year period represent an excellent reservoir of genetic variation for the application of a gwas. it is assumed that these accessions possess a diversity of alleles. such diversity can be examined  for soybean genetic improvement by identifying alleles that would be useful in achieving that genetic improvement. gwas offers one approach for accomplishing that objective.

linkage disequilibrium
an important consideration in the application of genome-wide association for gene discovery is the extent of ld. because of obvious differences in the extent of ld between different chromosomal regions, we elected to define ld separately for the euchromatic and heterochromatic regions of the  <dig> soybean chromosomes. the reliability of the approach used in the present study, i.e., to define the heterochromatic region of each chromosome as the region between the two inflection points of the cumulative genetic distance plotted against the cumulative physical distance, was previously examined in rice. in that species, the heterochromatic regions defined by suppressed recombination rate was in agreement with that identified by the conventional dapi staining method  <cit> . the plot of genetic distance on physical distance clearly indicated a higher recombination per physical distance in euchromatic regions vs. heterochromatic regions. approximately five times greater recombination per unit of physical distance occurs in soybean euchromatic versus heterochromatic regions. in the grass species, sorghum  moench), the recombination rate in euchromatic regions was approximately  <dig> times higher than that in heterochromatic regions  <cit> . in fact, 97-98% of the recombination occurred in the euchromatin of this species  <cit> . the difference in recombination rate between the heterochromatic regions and the euchromatic regions explains the difference in the extent of ld observed in the two chromosomal regions. the different levels of ld as indicated by r
2
 between different species and different chromosome regions within species can be explained by a combination of population histories including mating system, mutation rate, founding effects, the magnitude of selection, admixture, and genetic drift. the large difference in the ld level in euchromatic and heterochromatic regions, as shown in the present study, supports our contention that the density of markers required for gwas should be adjusted to take into account the changing ratio, along the length of a given chromosome, of recombination to genetic distance. in euchromatic regions with high recombination to physical distance, a high marker density will be required, whereas in heterochromatic regions, a lower marker density is acceptable. of course, until a whole genome sequence and a densely populated genetic map become available, it is not possible to precisely define the ratio of genetic to physical distance across the genome of a species to which a gwas is being conducted.

association analysis for seed protein and oil content
the challenge for association studies in crop plants is the identification of genes associated with quantitatively inherited agriculturally important traits. currently, many seed protein and oil qtl have been reported at many positions across the  <dig> soybean chromosomes/linkage groups in numerous studies . the genome positions where qtl were reported a number of times in studies using different sources of high seed protein and oil germplasm should be good candidates for the validation of associations detected via gwas. all the previously reported seed protein and oil qtl listed in soybase were identified using linkage analysis and thus, the causal gene could be located a substantial distance  from the markers which were reported to be genetically linked to the qtl. therefore, the exact position of the qtl determined by linkage analysis could not be precisely determined. however, with the release of version  <dig>  of the soybean genetic map  <cit> , which was produced from a joinmap  <dig>  analysis of five soybean mapping populations that collectively segregated for over  <dig>  markers, it is possible to more narrowly define the regions to which previously reported protein and oil qtl had been mapped. using this information, it is possible with some confidence to relate the physical position of the reported qtl from different studies with the snp positions identified by gwas in the present study. in that regard, we were able to align the  <dig> genome regions associated with seed protein identified in this study with previously reported seed protein qtl locations, and based on that alignment, determined that qtl had previously been reported in  <dig> of the  <dig> regions . notably, the seed protein qtl on gm <dig> has been reported seven times, the qtl at the  <dig>  mbp position on gm <dig> six times, the regions located on gm <dig>  gm <dig>  and gm <dig> four times, the region on gm <dig> three times, and the regions at  <dig>  mbp on gm <dig>   <dig>  kbp on gm <dig>  and on gm <dig> have been reported in two previous studies. of the  <dig> regions associated with seed oil content, the regions on gm <dig>  gm <dig>  and gm <dig> had been previously reported more than three times and the regions on gm <dig> and gm <dig>  the region at  <dig>  mbp on gm <dig>  and the region on gm <dig> have been reported twice. in addition, there were qtl that have been reported in previous studies which could not be found in this study. one reason could be that since the accessions used in this study were from the maturity groups ii, iii and iv, qtl identified in accessions from other maturity groups are not present in the germplasm accessions used in this study. for example, we did not find qtl reported in studies using very early or late maturity groups such as three qtl identified in populations derived from maturity group 00 ×  <dig>  <cit> , three qtl from maturity group 0 ×  <dig>  <cit> , nine qtl from maturity group vi × vi  <cit> , and three qtl from maturity group 0 × i  <cit> . a second reason may be that many protein and oil qtl have been identified in a number of different populations, however, if a qtl is controlled by a rare allele present only in a specific accession used in creating a qtl mapping population, it could not be detected in a gwas such as is reported here. the inability of gwas to detect rare alleles occurring in one or a few members of a population under study is well documented  <cit> .

the main differences between the findings of an association study versus linkage analysis are firstly, the ability to detect a range of genes controlling the phenotype under study rather than just those segregating in a given mating of two parents and secondly, the increased resolution resulting from historical recombination rather than the limited recombination in the progeny of a biparental population. the qtl identified on gm <dig> provides an example of the increased resolution of gwas. this seed protein qtl has been reported seven times in different g. soja × g. max and g. max × g. max populations with r
2
 values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . this qtl on gm <dig> has been recognized as a candidate region for possibly cloning the causal gene controlling seed protein content. bolon et al.  <cit>  analyzed gene expression of developing seeds in a pair of near isogenic lines  contrasting in seed protein concentration and differing for the region of gm <dig> containing this major seed protein qtl. differential transcript accumulation in the developing seeds of the nils was detected for  <dig> candidate genes. the region defined by bolon et al.  <cit>  in which these genes reside spans approximately  <dig>  mbp from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mbp on gm <dig>  based on the results of the ld estimation in the current study, we verified that the region defined by bolon et al.  <cit>  possessed two large ld blocks, as determined by r
2
, each spanning regions of approximately  <dig> mbp, one from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mbp and the other from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mbp . all the snps showing significant association with seed protein concentration were located in the  <dig>  to  <dig>  mbp region. thus, our gwas results support a narrowing of the candidate gene region of this major seed protein qtl on gm <dig> to about  <dig>  mbp versus the previously defined region of  <dig>  mbp  <cit> . only six of the  <dig> genes identified by bolon et al.  <cit>  were located within the gwas-defined  <dig>  mbp region . the gene candidates that remain include hsp <dig>  , a putative ammonium transporter amt <dig> , an atp synthase d chain   and three genes with limited similarity to known genes. we can assume that one or more of these genes may likely be the causative gene associated with soybean seed protein content. this high resolution mapping demonstrates the capacity of gwas to utilize historical recombination to increase resolution  <cit> .

the gwas for seed oil concentration also successfully defined  <dig> chromosome regions with high resolution, of which eight regions corresponded with previously reported oil qtl. thus, in the case of both seed protein and oil content, five chromosome regions were identified at which no previously reported qtl had been detected. these regions may be of particular interest to soybean breeders and geneticists as sources of genetic variation to alter soybean seed protein and oils levels.

it has been recognized that there is a negative correlation between seed size and seed protein concentration  <cit> , but more importantly, an even stronger negative correlation between seed oil and seed protein content  <cit> . g. soja has an extremely small seed size and much higher seed protein concentration   <cit>  than g. max. the average seed protein content in most g. max germplasm accessions is approximately  <dig> %  <cit> . the reasonable explanation could be that selection had been imposed for larger seed types during domestication by ancient soybean farmers which had a concurrent genetic consequence of lower seed protein concentration. the lower seed protein concentration resulting from selection would also simultaneously lead to the increase in seed oil concentration. the possible cause for this would be either very tight genetic linkage of the genes controlling seed protein and oil concentration or that both traits are controlled by the same gene  <cit> . the latter is more likely, given that high seed protein and the low seed oil almost always co-segregate and given the fact that many attempts to separate low seed oil from high seed protein  have been unsuccessful  <cit> . the results of gwas from the current study were not in complete agreement with this assertion given results for the snp at the  <dig>  mbp position on gm <dig> at which one allele was associated with both higher protein and oil content and the alternative allele with lower protein and oil content. this is a qtl that should be of interest to those breeding for seed constituents.

one suggested virtue of association studies is the ability to take advantage of existing phenotypic data. however, there are also obstacles to performing association studies using existing phenotypic data, especially in the case of quantitative traits such as soybean seed protein and oil content. the seed protein and oil data obtained from grin were derived from field evaluations of the usda soybean germplasm collection conducted over the past  <dig> years at various locations and the evaluations included accessions from one or more maturity groups. the seed protein and oil data for the accessions used in the current study were not from a single field trail or set of trials in which all of the  <dig> accessions were included. rather, the data were from a number of different trials grown in different environments and years. a quantitative trait defined in different studies and determined in a range of different environments and years is likely to produce different accession values that are confounded by these non-genetic effects, and it is, of course, the accession means that are used in gwas. such may be the case of the seed protein and oil concentration from the grin database used in this study . there was only a correlation of r =  <dig>  for seed protein concentration and  <dig>  for seed oil concentration between the replicated field data from the current study vs. the data reported in the grin. we have a high level of confidence in the data obtained in the current study given the low coefficient of variation in the two replicated field experiments at two locations and the high correlation of the seed protein and oil values between the two locations. thus, it is at least a possibility that the advantage often suggested for association study, i.e., the availability of large amounts of existing phenotypic data may, in some cases, not be the advantage that is often assumed.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we performed a gwas to detect genome regions controlling the quantitative traits, seed protein and oil content, using  <dig>  snp markers in a genetically diverse set of the  <dig> soybean germplasm accessions. despite the relatively low level of ld and complex population structure, we were able to successfully identify many of the previously reported qtl associated with soybean seed protein and oil, and we also were able to further narrow the size of the genome region in which those qtl were likely to be located. the chromosome regions defined in this study can be used for further analysis to identify the causal gene as well as to identify dna markers that can be used in selection to alter soybean seed protein and oil in a predictable manner. the snp data used in this study will soon be available through soybase  for more than  <dig>  g. max and g. soja germplasm accessions in the usda soybean germplasm collection based upon the analysis of the entire usda soybean germplasm collection with the illumina infinium soysnp50k beadchip described by song et al.  <cit> . these genotypic data should be a useful resource for the detection of agriculturally important genes/qtl using association analysis.
