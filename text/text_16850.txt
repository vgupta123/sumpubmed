BACKGROUND
cellular immunity plays an essential role in anti-tumor activity. immunocyte activity is often compromised in tumor patients, due to the inhibitory tumor environment. therefore, numerous preliminary studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of adoptive cellular immunotherapy —consisting of ex vivo expansion and activation of patient immunocytes followed by reinfusion  <cit> . aci has become a promising, innovative strategy for personalized cancer therapy  <cit> . due to the complexity of immune escape—such as antigen loss, mhc class i down-regulation, and the expression of inhibitory molecules—specific immune cells such as cytotoxic t lymphocytes  have limited utility in cancer therapeutics  <cit> . non-specific immune effector cells such as natural killer  cells, cytokine-induced killer  cells, and gamma-delta  t cells have better potential, since they have no mhc restriction, contribute to front-line anti-tumor surveillance, and bridge the gap between innate and adaptive immunity  <cit> . these cell types share many common mechanisms, including nkg2d and perforin-mediated cytotoxicity, and cytokine secretion . however, each of them has unique features, and their therapeutic effects have been shown in ex vivo studies and clinical trials.

nk cells, which are large, granular cd3−cd56+ lymphocytes, can be rapidly activated to spontaneously attack certain abnormal cells in the body, particularly cancerous or virus-infected cells  <cit> . individuals who have low nk cell activity are at increased risk of developing cancer  <cit> . several clinical trials have confirmed the therapeutic benefit and safety of nk cell adoptive infusion  <cit> . cik cells are heterogeneous. the main effector cells are cd3+cd56+ t cells, which exhibit both the powerful anti-tumor effect of t cells and the non-mhc restriction of nk cells  <cit> . recent clinical studies have indicated that cik cells can significantly improve progression-free survival, overall survival, and effective clinical response in cancer patients  <cit> . in addition to nk and cik cells, γδ t cells may display the same cytotoxicity as nk and cik cells, and act as antigen-presenting cells.

for the past decade, aci with nk, cik, and γδ t cells has been a primary focus in cancer therapy, especially for hematological malignancies such as leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma . however, there has been no direct comparison of these cell types. in this study, we evaluated the feasibility of in vitro expansion of each immune cell type and compared their antitumor activity against various forms of hematological cancers with the aim of providing in vitro evidence for their use in aci cancer therapies.

RESULTS
cell quantification and expansion
nk, cik, and γδ t cells were induced from the pbmcs of  <dig> cancer patients. after 14 days induction, immunocyte viability exceeded 85 % without contamination. all cells were able to propagate in vitro: nk cells to a median of 359-fold , cik cells to 253-fold , and γδ t to 550-fold ; γδ t cells had the strongest amplification ability .fig.  <dig> fold expansion of nk, cik, and γδ t cells. fold expansion was calculated by dividing the absolute output number of expanded nk, cik, and γδ t cells after 14 days of culture by the respective number on day  <dig>  results are expressed as mean ± sd, n = 20; * p <  <dig> , **  <dig>  < p <  <dig> , *** p <  <dig> 



after induction and expansion, the percentage of expanded nk , cik , and γδ t  cells showed a slight positive correlation with their percentage in the patients’ blood . these data suggest the percentage of immune cells in the patients’ blood likely has little effect on the ex vivo induction of these immune cell types, further demonstrating the stability and broad applicability of our methods.

all three induced immune cells expressed perforin. nk cells showed much higher perforin production than the other two expanded immune cell types. γδ t cells showed slightly higher perforin production than cik cells . almost all nk  and cik  cells and a majority of γδ t cells  were granzyme b-positive. however, nk cells yielded the strongest expression of granzyme b .fig.  <dig> perforin and granzyme b production in expanded nk, cik, and γδ t cells. three types of immune cells from twenty cancer patients were harvested after 14 days induction in vitro. nk and cik cells were stained with mabs to cd <dig> and cd <dig>  and γδ t cells were stained with cd <dig> and vγ <dig>  after fixation and permeabilization, cells were stained for perforin and granzyme b using specific conjugated anti-human cytokine mabs. a perforin-positive cells and mean fluorescence intensity  of nk, cik, and γδ t cells. b granzyme b-positive cells and mfi of nk, cik, and γδ t cells. results are expressed as mean ± sd, n =  <dig>  * p <  <dig> , **  <dig>  < p <  <dig> , *** p <  <dig> , ns p >  <dig> 



cytokine secretion of the expanded cells
nearly all of the expanded nk cells and half of the cik and γδ t cells were ifn-γ-positive. about 40 % of the nk cells were il-2-positive, while only a small portion of cik and γδ t cells were positive for il- <dig> . nk cells were much more efficient secretors of ifn-γ and il- <dig> than were cik and γδ t cells . subsets of nk cells or cik and γδ t cells secreted a very high level of ifn-γ, yet only a small amount of il- <dig> was detected in the supernatant of the cik and γδ t cells. no differences in inf-γ and il- <dig> secretion were observed between cik and γδ t cells. very low levels of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> were detected in the supernatants of nk, cik, and γδ t cells .fig.  <dig> cytokine production in nk, cik, and γδ t cells. a intracellular staining of ifn-γ and il- <dig> in nk, cik, and γδ t cells. intracellular levels of il- <dig> and ifn-γ were measured as described for perforin and granzyme b detection. b extracellular cytokine production of nk, cik, and γδ t cells. the culture supernatants were collected and analyzed by elisa for ifn-γ, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  results are expressed as the mean ± sd, n =  <dig>  * p <  <dig> , **  <dig>  < p <  <dig> , *** p <  <dig> , ns p >  <dig> 



cytotoxicity of expanded immune cells against hematologic malignancies cell lines
we compared the cytotoxicity of nk, cik, and γδ t cells against hematologic tumors, as bulk expanded immune cells tested in the calcein-am assay showed substantial cytotoxic capacity. nk cells exhibited the most significant cytotoxicity in k <dig> , nb <dig> , hl- <dig> , and u <dig>  cells. both nk and γδ t cells produced stronger cytotoxic effects against jurkat cells than cik cells . although all three expanded cell types exhibited limited cytotoxicity against raji cells compared to other target cells, nk cells exerted the strongest antitumor activity . interestingly, the addition of rituximab significantly enhanced raji lysis by all cell types; however, nk cells continued to show a greater synergistic cytotoxicity in raji cells with rituximab in comparison to cik and γδ t cells. nevertheless, there were no notable differences in cytotoxicity against raji cells between cik and γδ t cells in the presence of rituximab .fig.  <dig> anti-tumor cytotoxicity of induced immune cells in vitro. cytolysis against hematological malignancy targets k <dig> , nb- <dig> , jurkat , hl- <dig> , u <dig> , and raji  cells were compared at 10: <dig> effector-target ratios . nk cells showed the most significant cytotoxicity. results are expressed as the mean ± sd, n =  <dig>  * p <  <dig> , **  <dig>  < p <  <dig> , *** p <  <dig> , ns p >  <dig>

discussion
although many studies have shown the importance of nk, cik, and γδ t cells in the prevention of tumor relapse and metastasis in mice and humans  <cit> , few studies have directly compared their cytotoxic effects to identify which would be the optimal candidate for clinical application. there are many issues to be considered prior to clinical application, including the number of introduced cells, the feasibility of in vitro expansion, and their respective anti-tumor activities.

obtaining an adequate number of immune cells is a key challenge for aci application in a clinical setting  <cit> . studies indicate that sufficient numbers of cik and γδ t cells can be obtained by current methods  <cit> ; however, methods for the expansion of nk cells in vitro have being investigated by using feeder cells, including irradiated allogenic pbmcs  <cit> , k <dig> cells  <cit> , and epstein-barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines  <cit> . although these nk cell infusions are well tolerated and partially effective, current methods for nk cell preparation involve complex separation protocols and often require ethical approval that render them expensive and sub-optimal or unfeasible for large-scale clinical studies  <cit> . to overcome these disadvantages, we examined whether the use of cd <dig> antibody-coated flasks could be used in place of feeder cells. our studies demonstrate that a substantial number of nk cells could be generated, ranging from 250–669-fold expansions, after 14 days induction and culture. importantly, this is comparable to the yields of feeder-cell methods  <cit> . in addition to nk cells, we amplified cik and γδ t cells in vitro using conventionally optimized methods. although several studies have shown that cik cells easily proliferate in vitro  <cit> , our investigation shows that the proliferative ability of nk cells in our culture setup was superior to that of cik cells. we also found that the ratios of nk, cik, and γδ t cells in the blood of cancer patients had no effect on their amplification efficiency. these results demonstrate that all three expanded immunocyte types have the potential for in vitro expansion to generate sufficient numbers for clinical applications.

the antitumor capacity of effector cells is another challenge in aci. our study assessed the phenotype, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity of the expanded cell types. since nk, cik, and γδ t cells have shown significant efficacy in the treatment of hematological malignancies in vivo and in vitro, we selected leukemia and multiple myeloma cell lines as target cells for our analyses.

there are two main nk cell subsets distinguished by the level of cd <dig> expression in human blood, namely cd56dim and cd <dig> bright  <cit> . cd56dim cells are fully matured and strongly express cd <dig>  a low-affinity fc immunoglobulin g receptor that allows immune cells to participate in adcc  <cit> . in contrast, cd56bright cells are more immature and are primarily considered to be cytokine producers with a limited role in cytolytic responses  <cit> . the nk cells expanded in this study had very high cd <dig>  and cd <dig> expression, and may represent a subset of nk cells undergoing differentiation. nk cells also express inhibitory and stimulatory receptors, such as killer immunoglobulin-like receptor , cd <dig>  and nkg2d. the cytotoxic reactivity of nk cells results from the integration of signals from the stimulatory and inhibitory receptors as they engage ligands on the target cell surface. our studies show that nk cells propagated in cd <dig> antibody-coated flasks exhibit increased expression of nkg2d and cd <dig>  and decreased expression of inhibitory kir. intracellular and extracellular cytokine detection indicated that nk cells were more potent producers of ifn-γ than cik and γδ t cells . ifn-γ enhances antigen presentation by dendritic cells and stimulates production of the cxc chemokines mig  and ip- <dig> , which inhibit tumor angiogenesis and recruit cxcr3-bearing effector cells to tumor sites  <cit> . therefore, nk cells producing high amounts of ifn-γ could contribute greatly to tumor regression during cancer immunotherapy.

since induced immunocytes are usually used for aci without purification, these cultured cells were directly harvested for cytotoxicity detection. in comparison to cik and γδ t cells, the nk cells expanded in this study were significantly more cytotoxic toward many kinds of malignant cells lines including nk-resistant raji cells . raji cells normally elude nk cell recognition due to their expression of inhibitory kir ligands  and a lack of nkg2d ligands   <cit> . the increased cytotoxic effects observed with our cultured nk cells likely result from their down-regulation of inhibitory kir–cd158a and cd158b that engage hla-cw <dig> and hla-cw <dig>  respectively.

adcc is another mechanism by which cells convey antitumor activity, which is dependent on immunocyte cd <dig> expression. nk cells showed the highest expression of cd <dig> and the strongest adcc efficacy in the presence of rituximab . this implies that large-scale nk cell expansion can promote the development of an effective combination therapy for cancer. while few differences were observed in adcc function between cik and γδ t cells, a significant difference in cd <dig> expression was detected between cd3+cd56+ cik and γδ t cells. interestingly, cik cells displayed a stronger cytotoxic effect toward k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells than γδ t cells, in contrast to our observations in jurkat cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we established a cytokine-based expansion system for nk cells with the aim of developing them for clinical application. nk cells not only have a higher expansion capacity, but also much stronger antitumor activity in cytokine production, director cytotoxicity, and adcc effect. our analyses found that nk cells exhibit stronger cytotoxicity against lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma cells than expanded cik and γδ t cells. therefore, our study provides ex vivo evidence for the direct comparison of nk, cik, and γδ t cells. we also provide experimental evidence for their clinical application in hematological malignancies.
