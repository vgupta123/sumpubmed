BACKGROUND
homologous recombination is initiated by the generation of dna double stranded breaks  by the spo <dig> protein  <cit> . subsequent repair of these breaks culminates in the formation of crossing overs  between homologous chromosomes that, in turn, are required for faithful chromosomal segregation  <cit> . failure to produce at least one co per chromosome pair leads to meiotic arrest or to the formation of aneuploid gametes  <cit> . in mammalian males, the x and y chromosomes face a particular challenge since they share only a very short homologous area called the pseudoautosomal region . accordingly, numerical abnormalities of sex chromosomes collectively represent the most common human aneuploidies  <cit> .

the spo <dig> protein has two major isoforms that have different expression patterns  <cit> . the beta isoform appears early and maintains a relatively constant level throughout the first meiotic prophase  <cit> . this form is sufficient for the production of the majority of meiotic dsbs  <cit> . expression of the alpha isoform in males predominantly occurs in late prophase, beginning in early pachynema  <cit> , and lack of spo11α correlates with a reduction in the number of late-forming dsbs in the par  <cit> . since mice expressing only the spo11β isoform are also deficient in x/y synapsis spo11α is thought to be specifically required for efficient recombination in the par  <cit> .

the majority of meiotic dsbs are formed at discreet areas of the genome called recombination hotspots  <cit> . in mice and human the hotspot locations are determined by the sequence specificity of the dna binding domain of the prdm <dig> protein  <cit> . this domain is highly polymorphic with different prdm <dig> alleles predicted to recognize dissimilar dna sequences  <cit> . this leads to different hotspot locations in individuals carrying different prdm <dig> alleles . the only hotspots that are shared between mouse strains with different prdm <dig> alleles, as well as with the prdm <dig> knockout mouse are found in the par and in the adjacent area  <cit> , suggesting the existence of a prdm9-independent dsb pathway. the par contains a large  cluster of overlapping hotspots that collectively represent the hottest area of dsb formation in the mouse  <cit> . such extensive dsb formation in the par is likely important to ensure that par undergoes an obligatory co in every meiosis  <cit> . although supporting evidence is not yet available, the dsb targeting to prdm9-dependent hotspots could be explained, at least in principle, by a physical interaction between the dsb machinery and the prdm <dig> protein . however, the mechanisms that target dsbs to the par are not understood.

in this study we generate a gal4bd-spo <dig> mouse carrying a hypomorphic spo <dig> allele that is deficient in the formation of dsbs in the par. this deficiency does not represent a specific defect in the prdm9-independent dsb pathway, because prdm9-dependent hotspots are also depleted in the region adjacent to the par in these mice. furthermore, dsb reduction is also apparent at the subtelomeric regions of other chromosomes as well. our data suggest that specific factors influence early steps of homologous recombination in subtelomeric regions including the par, and that the gal4bd-spo <dig> mice have a specific defect that compromises the proper execution of the recombination program in these areas.

RESULTS
generation of the gal4bd-spo <dig> knock-in mouse
the yeast gal <dig> transcription factor binds to the promoters of several s. cerevisiae gal genes through its n-terminal dna-binding domain . this domain recognizes the cggn11ccg consensus sequence and, when attached to the yeast spo <dig> protein, it is able to tether spo <dig> to gal <dig> recognition sites leading to the formation of gal4bd-spo <dig> specific recombination hotspots  <cit> . to evaluate if such tethering is possible in mice we used gene targeting in embryonic stem cells to introduce the dna fragment coding for the dna binding domain of the yeast gal <dig> protein upstream of the start codon of the mouse spo <dig> gene . the expression and correct splicing of the resulting gene was confirmed by sequencing pcr fragments generated from cdna of the gal4bd-spo <dig> homozygous  mice. we confirmed that both major isoforms of spo <dig> – alpha and beta – were transcribed . nevertheless, testes of the spo11gal/gal mice were reduced in size and germ cells beyond the spermatocyte stage were absent . furthermore, no sperm was detected in the epididymus  indicating that spo11gal/gal males were infertile. similarly, spo11gal/gal ovaries were smaller than in wild type and showed a greatly diminished number of follicles . young spo11gal/gal females did produce progeny, however no viable litters have been obtained from mice older than 6 months, suggesting a premature cessation of fertility. females carrying only one copy of the gal allele and one null copy of spo <dig>  showed a further reduction in ovarian size, no visible follicles and an underdeveloped uterus, indicating that a single gal4bd-spo <dig> allele is insufficient to maintain fertility .

the number of meiotic dsbs is reduced in the spo11gal/gal mice
the yeast counterpart of the chimeric gal4bd-spo <dig> gene complements the spo11Δ mutation, indicating that the fusion gal4bd-spo <dig> protein is proficient at dsb formation  <cit> . to determine whether dsbs are formed in the spo11gal/gal mice we immunostained chromosomal spreads prepared from spermatocytes  or oocytes  with antibodies to the dmc <dig> protein, known to bind to the single stranded dna tails of dsbs  <cit> . although dmc <dig> foci were observed, their number was significantly reduced compared to wild type. precise counting of dsbs is complicated by the dynamic nature of dsb formation and repair. while one can estimate the steady state level of dmc <dig> foci on each chromosomal spread, the dsbs that have already been repaired and the dsbs that have not yet formed will be under-counted. this problem is particularly pronounced when mutants with delayed or defective dsb repair are compared to wild type. to eliminate the effect of possible timing differences in the formation and/or repair of dsbs between spo11gal/gal and spo11+/+ mice, we compared the number of dmc <dig> foci on a hop2−/− genetic background, i.e., in spo11gal/galhop2−/−versus spo11+/+hop2−/− cells. the hop <dig> protein is directly involved in the repair of meiotic dsbs  <cit> , accordingly, hop2−/− mice undergo meiotic arrest at the stage when all dsbs are already produced but none are repaired  <cit> . therefore, the analysis of the mutants on the hop2−/− background will reduce counting bias resulting from dsb formation/repair dynamics. we found that the number of dmc <dig> foci in spo11gal/galhop2−/− spermatocytes was approximately  <dig> fold lower than that in the spo11+/+hop2−/− spermatocytes . moreover, in spo11gal/– spermatocytes, where one gal and one null allele of spo <dig> were present, the number of dmc <dig> foci was reduced even further – to approximately 1/6th of the wild type level . the reduction of the dsb number in spo11gal/galhop2−/− females was more profound than in males, with only 1/4th of the normal number of dmc <dig> foci being formed .

to understand what could be the reason for the reduced number of dsbs we examined the mrna levels of the chimeric gal4bd-spo <dig> protein in testes and ovaries by quantitative pcr. gal4bd-spo <dig> male mice undergo meiotic arrest  and do not produce spermatids, which normally account for a large fraction of the testis germ cell population. therefore, the cell type composition in testes of the gal4bd-spo <dig> and wild type mice is vastly different, creating a challenge for a meaningful comparison of gene expression levels. to minimize this difference we again employed hop2−/− mice, which undergo meiotic arrest at a similar stage  <cit>  as the gal4bd-spo <dig> mice. we found that the mrna level of the gal4bd-spo <dig> protein in the gal4bd-spo <dig> mice is significantly lower than the mrna level of the spo <dig> protein in wild type or in hop2−/− mice . more specifically, in gal4bd-spo <dig> males, the level of the beta isoform was reduced  <dig>  fold compared to that in hop2−/− mice, and the level of the alpha isoform was reduced  <dig> -fold . in gal4bd-spo <dig> females the expression of the beta isoform was reduced  <dig>  fold compared to wild type mice and the expression of the alpha isoform was reduced  <dig>  fold . these data indicate that the mrna level of the chimeric gal4bd-spo <dig> protein is profoundly reduced and that the observed reduction in the number of introduced dsbs could be, at least in part, a consequence of this reduction. it is also conceivable that the addition of the gal <dig> binding domain to the mouse spo <dig> protein might compromise the activity of spo <dig>  contributing to the reduced dsb count in gal4bd-spo <dig> mice.

homologous chromosome synapsis in spogal/gal mice is incomplete
the formation of meiotic dsbs is followed by rapid phosphorylation of histone h2ax  <cit> . during break repair homologous chromosomes are brought together and align throughout their entire length within a proteinaceous structure called the synaptonemal complex  . this coincides with the disappearance of the phosphorylated h2ax  and subsequent localization of the mlh <dig> protein to the sites of crossovers  <cit> . we analyzed homologous synapsis in gal4bd-spo <dig> spermatocytes by immunostaining the scp <dig> protein, a component of the central element of the sc  <cit>  . although a number of chromosomes in spo11gal/gal spermatocytes appeared properly synapsed, no cells had undergone complete synapsis. a large fraction of chromosomes synapsed only partially or formed branched structures indicative of non-homologous synapsis. γh2ax staining was lost from those chromosomes that had undergone complete synapsis, indicating successful dsb repair . partially synapsed and branched chromosomes retained substantial γh2ax staining. synaptic defects were even more prominent in the spo11gal/– spermatocytes, indicating that a further reduction in the number of dsbs further compromises homology search and homologous synapsis . although some oocytes completed meiosis and resulted in a progeny, the majority showed defects in homologous synapsis. nevertheless, unlike in spermatocytes , mlh <dig> foci were evident in oocytes even when only a fraction of homologous chromosomes were successfully synapsed .

the x and y chromosomes synapse and recombine at the short region of homology within the par  <cit> . unsynapsed parts of x and y trigger transcriptional silencing of sex chromosomes associated with their assembly into a specialized chromatin domain called the sex or xy body . at this stage the x/y chromatin is decorated by a number of proteins including γh2ax. we found that a sex body was not assembled in the spo11gal/gal spermatocytes, as no area of dense and discrete γh2ax staining was observed . the failure of sex body formation and impairment of transcriptional silencing is common in recombination mutants with compromised dsb repair and homologous synapsis . transcriptional silencing of sex chromosomes is required for meiotic progression beyond the pachytene stage in males  <cit> , potentially explaining the dimorphic phenotype  in a number of mouse mutants with mild to moderate synaptic defects; e.g., sycp3−/− <cit> , h2ax−/− <cit> , sycp2−/− <cit> , dmc1mei11/+ <cit> , brca1Δ11/Δ11p53+/− <cit> , spo11β-only <cit> . similar mechanisms are likely to be the reason for the dimorphic phenotype observed in gal4bd-spo <dig> mice.

the mouse gal4bd-spo <dig> fusion protein can target meiotic dsbs to gal <dig> consensus binding sites
we have mapped the distribution of dsbs in the gal4bd-spo <dig> mouse using anti-dmc <dig> chromatin immunoprecipitation  followed by high throughput sequencing  <cit> . to increase the sensitivity of the hotspot detection we have also mapped dsbs in the gal4bd-spo <dig> mice on the hop <dig> knockout background . this allowed identification of  <dig>  hotspots. 98% of the hotspots detected in spo11gal/gal were also present in spo11gal/galhop2−/− mice, reaffirming that the hop <dig> mutation does not affect the distribution of meiotic dsbs genome-wide  <cit> . we have compared the distribution of gal4bd-spo <dig> hotspots to hotspots in wild type mice  <cit>  and to those in hop <dig> knockout mice. we found that  <dig> % of the top  <dig>  gal4bd-spo <dig> hotspots correspond to wild type hotspots. when all  <dig>  gal4bd-spo <dig> hotspots are considered the overlap between gal4bd-spo <dig> and wild type hotspots is  <dig> %. therefore, the overall distribution of recombination hotspots in gal4bd-spo <dig> mice is not affected. the relative strength of the hotspots shared between wild type and gal4bd-spo <dig> mice is also highly correlated .

there are  <dig>  gal <dig> consensus cggn11ccg sequences present in the mouse genome. approximately 2% of dsb hotspots overlapped these sites in either wild type or hop2−/− mice . however, when the spo11gal/galhop2−/− mice were examined, the number of consensus-bearing hotspots increased to ~4%. these extra hotspots are weak, and although some of them are also apparent in the spo11gal/gal mice upon visual examination, they were beyond the detection threshold in this sample . out of  <dig> gal4bd-spo <dig> hotspots with a gal <dig> consensus site  <dig> were also present in wild type mice . a prominent peak in the distribution of wild type hotspot motif  <cit>  was found at the center of these hotspots, whereas the distribution of the gal <dig> consensus appeared random. the remaining  <dig> gal4bd-spo <dig> hotspots with a gal <dig> consensus were gal4bd-spo11-specific. we found that the gal <dig> recognition sequence rather than the hotspot consensus motif is enriched at the centers of these hotspots. furthermore, only 3% of these gal4bd-spo11-specific hotspots overlapped prdm9-dependent histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> trimethylation marks . in aggregate, these data indicate that a small fraction of dsbs in the gal4bd-spo <dig> mice are likely targeted through a prdm9-independent mechanism by tethering of the gal4bd-spo <dig> protein to gal <dig> binding sites. in addition to the h3k4me <dig> introduced by the prdm <dig> protein, gene promoters and enhancers are also decorated with h3k4me <dig>  <cit> . we have previously found that such sites represent preferred dsb formation loci in mice lacking prdm <dig> <cit> . we now show that 84% of gal4bd-spo11-specific hotspots overlap transcription start sites. importantly, the vast majority  of gal4bd-spo11-specific hotspots overlap h3k4me <dig>  indicating that h3k4me <dig> marks or/and events preceding h3k <dig> trimethylation are still essential when dsb targeting is gal4-mediated.

the genotype of mouse strains is listed in the left column. sequenced ssdna tags indicate the number of ssdna-derived fragments  that have been sequenced for this analysis. the number of hotspots identified in each mouse strain is also indicated  and the overlap of these hotspots with the hotspots found in the wild type mice  is specified . the number of hotspots that contain gal <dig> consensus motif  and the percentage of gal4-containing hotspots in the total number of hotspots identified in the corresponding samples  are shown to demonstrate the increase in the gal4-containing hotspots in the spo11gal/galhop2−/− mice .

gal4bd-spo <dig> mice lack a dsb hotspot cluster in the par
we have previously demonstrated that the par carries a large cluster of overlapping dsb hotspots  <cit>  that are most likely required to ensure an obligate dsb  in the par. although individual hotspots cannot be resolved within the hotspot cluster it is clear that a large fraction, if not all, par hotspots are fundamentally different from those in the rest of the genome, because their formation does not depend on prdm <dig>  <cit> . the formation of dsbs in the par has been reported to occur in two rounds: one  set is introduced at the same time as the majority of the autosomal breaks and the second one is introduced at a relatively late stage, presumably, by the alpha isoform of the spo <dig> protein  <cit> . we found that gal4bd-spo <dig> mice are severely deficient in dsb formation in the par . the contribution of the dsbs in the par hotspot cluster to the total number of dsbs introduced genome-wide in hop2−/− mice is estimated as  <dig> %, but drops over 30-fold  in the spo11gal/galhop2−/− . although this defect may be explained to some extent by the extremely low expression of the spo <dig> alpha isoform in the mutant, the complete lack of spo <dig> alpha has been reported to result in only a 3-fold reduction of the dsbs in the par  <cit> . reduced expression of the beta isoform in the gal4bd-spo <dig> mice could be another reason for the dsb reduction. however, the overall number of dsbs in the gal4bd-spo <dig> mice  is reduced only  <dig> -fold. it is therefore likely that, in addition to reduced protein level, a specific defect of the gal4bd-spo <dig> protein contributes to the drastic reduction of the dsbs in the par.

gal4bd-spo <dig> mice exhibit a deficiency of dsbs at chromosomal ends
the par is located at the end of the x and y chromosomes. we therefore examined whether dsb formation in gal4bd-spo <dig> mice is also affected at the ends of autosomes. indeed, we found that the strength of dsb hotspots near chromosome ends is significantly reduced in spo11gal/gal and spo11gal/galhop2−/−mice , and as a consequence, many subtelomeric hotspots that are present in wild-type mice are not detected. this phenomenon was not observed in hop <dig> knockout mice indicating that the effect is not related to the meiotic arrest in gal4bd-spo <dig> spermatocytes.

we propose that specific suppression of homologous recombination at subtelomeres of the gal4bd-spo <dig> mice indicates the potential difference in the dsbs formed in these areas compared to dsbs in the rest of the genome. for example, it is conceivable that dsb formation close to chromosome ends is influenced by telomere attachment to the nuclear periphery  <cit>  or by a specific chromosome organization and chromatin structure in the telomere-adjacent regions. specific interactions may occur in these areas between the dsb machinery and proteins enriched at telomeres and/or subtelomeres. in fact, one such protein has recently been implicated in the regulation of transcription  <cit> . incidentally, spo <dig> itself was reported to bind to the telomeres of mouse embryonic stem cells  <cit> . it is therefore possible that the gal4bd-spo <dig> protein alone or as a component of the dsb formation complex is deficient in overcoming the inhibitory effects of the specific chromatin environment of subtelomeric regions. such a deficiency can result from  the inability of gal4bd-spo <dig> to interact with a particular protein or protein complex,  attenuated gal4bd-spo <dig> dna binding in the context of such a chromatin environment or even  a defect in gal4bd-spo <dig> removal from dna in these regions that would prevent processing of meiotic dsb ends and loading rad <dig> and dmc <dig>  it is important to note that prdm9-dependent h3k4me <dig> is introduced normally in hotspot-depleted regions of gal4bd-spo <dig> subtelomeres , therefore prdm <dig> accessibility to these areas is not an issue.

CONCLUSIONS
although the pivotal role of prdm <dig> in defining the positions of individual recombination hotspots is established, a large number of potential prdm <dig> binding sites in the genome are not being utilized. it is not clear what makes such sites refractory to the dsb machinery, but higher order chromatin structure and chromosome organization within the nucleus are likely to play a role. these features might provide slowly evolving physical constraints, which, according to a two-stage model of recombination initiation  <cit> , ensure relatively similar recombination frequencies over large chromosomal domains between individuals in spite of prdm9-dependent variability at individual hotspots within such domains. the gal4bd-spo <dig> mutant shows a domain-specific defect in initiation of homologous recombination without visible changes in the rest of the genome. this model will be instrumental in dissecting specific interactions occurring between subtelomeric chromatin and the dsb machinery and in providing molecular insights into the megabase-scale control of initiation of homologous recombination.
