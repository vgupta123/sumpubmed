BACKGROUND
plant cells are encased within the primary cell wall, a complex of polysaccharides and proteins. the primary cell wall is typically composed of two main polysaccharide networks: one is made of cellulose microfibrils linked together with a hemicellulose matrix, and the other, made of pectins, is a complex heteropolysaccharide that hydrates and further cements the primary cell wall matrix
 <cit> . pectins represent 35% of primary cell wall polysaccharides in dicots and non-graminaceous monocots
 <cit> , hemicellulose accounts for 20-30% and the rest corresponds to cellulose
 <cit> . the primary cell wall plays a role in various fundamental physiological processes such as plant growth and development, morphogenesis, cell signaling, cell-cell interactions, and protection against pathogens, dehydration and other environmental factors
 <cit> .

some microorganisms, especially phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi
 <cit> , as well as plant parasitic nematodes
 <cit>  are very efficient in degrading plant cell wall polysaccharides either to use them as nutrients for their own growth or to get access to plant cells. these organisms secrete an impressive arsenal of enzymes specifically targeting plant cell wall polysaccharides, referred to here as plant cell wall degrading enzymes or pcwdes. among these, polygalacturonases, pectin methylesterases and pectin lyases degrade the pectin network, whereas various endo- and exoglucanases target the cellulose/hemicellulose network
 <cit> .

in insects, endogenous cellulase genes are apparently absent from the genome of model insects such as drosophila melanogaster or bombyx mori. cellulase genes are also absent from the recently sequenced genomes of two butterflies, the monarch danaus plexippus and the postman heliconius melpomene, whose caterpillars are herbivorous feeding on milkweed and passion flower respectively
 <cit> . on the other hand, the association between wood-feeding termites and their symbiotic protists offers a textbook example of cellulose digestion in insects, in which not only the protists provide cellulose-degrading enzymes but also the insect itself
 <cit> . furthermore, endogenous cellulase genes have also been discovered in other xylophagous insects, for example, cerambycid beetles
 <cit> . recently, a single endogenous cellulase from the glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  has been identified and functionally characterized from the genome of the model beetle tribolium castaneum <cit> . pcwdes other than cellulases, such as polygalacturonases, pectin methylesterases, mannanases and xylanases, have also been identified in insects, some of them recently, mainly in plant bugs
 <cit>  and phytophagous beetles
 <cit> . finally, our recent transcriptome survey revealed that putative pcwdes are encoded by diverse and complex multigene families in phytophagous beetles from the superfamilies chrysomeloidea and curculionoidea, mainly in species of leaf beetles , weevils and bark beetles 
 <cit> . the presence of such genes in herbivorous beetles may indeed have contributed to the success of their plant-feeding adaptation, making some of them into notorious agricultural pests. however, a major drawback of this transcriptome sequencing analysis
 <cit>  lies in the absence of a connection between the presence of transcripts encoding putative pcwdes in phytophagous beetles and their physiological functions. in other words, we still do not know if these genes encode functional proteins able to degrade plant cell wall polysaccharides. to address this problem, we decided to take a different approach, by first identifying beetle-derived enzymes responsible for the degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides using a proteomics approach and then comparing them to the total number of putative pcwde-encoding transcripts found in the corresponding transcriptome.

here, we extend a study by girard & jouanin
 <cit> , by assaying the proteome of larval phaedon cochleariae  gut contents for degrading activities towards four plant cell wall-derived polysaccharides: cellulose, xylan, mannan and pectin. to identify the enzymes responsible for these degrading activities, we used a two-dimensional proteomics approach, first separating gut content proteins by anion exchange chromatography followed by high-resolution sds-page of protein-containing fractions. combining this approach with either diffusion plate assays or zymograms helped us define which protein bands to further analyze by mass spectrometry. protein identification was achieved by searching ms spectra obtained from tryptic-digested peptides against diverse protein databases, including a p. cochleariae transcriptome database generated by combining sequencing information obtained from sanger and both  <dig> and illumina nextgen sequencing technologies. we found that several host plant-derived proteins are very stable and persist undegraded in the insect digestive tract. we also showed that there was a discrepancy between the number of pcwdes identified by proteomics analyses and the total number of putative pcwde-encoding transcripts found in the transcriptome. this discrepancy was partially explained by the relative abundance of pcwde-encoding transcripts in p. cochleariae midguts, an abundance that we determined by quantitative pcr and rna-seq experiments.

RESULTS
degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides by p. cochleariae larval gut contents
enzymatic activities against carboxymethylcellulose , xylan and pectin have already been described for whole gut extracts from p. cochleariae larvae
 <cit> . nevertheless, we decided to repeat these experiments using gut contents rather than whole gut homogenates. in beetles, enzymes thought to be responsible for the degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides are likely to be secreted because of the presence of a predicted signal peptide at the amino-terminus of their respective amino acid sequences
 <cit> . therefore, these proteins should be enriched in gut contents which, in insects, contain mainly digestive enzymes secreted by midgut cells in direct contact with the food bolus
 <cit> . indeed, in diffusion assays, the gut contents from p. cochleariae larvae exert strong enzymatic activity against cmc, pectin and xylan, but no activity against galactomannan could be detected . these findings correlate well with what has been previously observed in this coleopteran species
 <cit> .

in  <dig>  girard & jouanin
 <cit>  demonstrated that p. cochleariae larval midgut homogenates were capable of degrading cellulose, pectin and xylan, and that transcripts encoding putative pcwdes were actually present in a p. cochleariae gut cdna library. nonetheless, these scientists did not show that the transcripts they sequenced from the cdna library encoded the proteins responsible for the enzymatic activities they described. to address this, we combined a proteomics approach to transcriptome sequencing to identify the proteins responsible for these enzymatic activities. initially, we separated gut content proteins by anion exchange chromatography similar to our previous work
 <cit> , considering this step as the ‘first dimension’ of a two-dimensional approach. a large portion of these proteins bound to the column and were eluted with nacl concentration ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> mm. after resolving these fractions by 1d/sds-page, which corresponds to the ‘second dimension’ of our two-dimensional approach, we used coomassie blue staining to reveal a relatively simple pattern of distinct protein bands . each fraction was tested for enzymatic activity towards cmc, xylan, pectin and mannan by two independent methods:  diffusion assays on agarose plates and  zymograms using sds-page in ‘semi native’ conditions. cmcase activity was very intense according to both diffusion assay and zymogram  and was detected in the same fractions with both techniques . guided by the pattern obtained using zymogram , we decided to pick protein bands number  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  strong xylanase activity could be detected only in fractions from the flowthrough ; no clear activity pattern could be obtained by zymogram . similarly, pectinase activity was detected in the flowthrough by diffusion assay but not by zymogram. we decided therefore to pick all visible protein bands from the flowthrough fraction with an apparent molecular weight above  <dig> kda for tentative identification by mass spectrometry . pectinase activity was also detected in bound fractions from the anion exchange chromatography both by diffusion assay and by zymogram , which led us to pick protein band  <dig>  the activity patterns we obtained by zymogram using cmc and pectin as substrates are very similar to those obtained by girard & jouanin
 <cit> . altogether  <dig> protein bands were collected and analyzed by mass spectrometry for tentative identification.

protein identification strategy
we decided to perform and compare two independent mass spectrometry analyses:  a ‘classical’ lc-ms/ms data-dependent acquisition method , and  a relatively recent lc-mse data-independent acquisition method 
 <cit> . importantly, the second method has been shown to improve protein and proteome coverage compared to the conventional lc-ms/ms approach
 <cit> . in general, protein identifications obtained by both methods were in accordance, with the better coverage generally observed with lc-mse compared to lc-ms/ms . identifications were only obtained either by lc-ms/ms in four cases or by lc-mse in five cases . in addition, data obtained from the lc-ms/ms analyses were searched against various databases using mascot and were alternatively interpreted de novo and searched against the same databases using ms blast
 <cit> . we performed the ms blast searches to confirm and increase the confidence of the mascot searches. we found that all ms blast searches were in accordance to the identifications obtained using mascot except in the case of protein band  <dig> for which we found substantial differences between both search methods . altogether, this strategy resulted in highly confident protein identifications with a very limited rate of false positives. detailed information regarding protein identifications is given as supplementary information .

stability of host plant-derived proteins in p. cochleariae gut contents
as the insects we used were fed on chinese cabbage plants and not on artificial diet, we hypothesized that host plant-derived proteins could also be present in p. cochleariae gut contents. to evaluate the presence of chinese cabbage-derived proteins in our sample, we subjected the data we obtained from both lc-ms/ms and lc-mse analyses to a search against a viridiplantae protein database. several proteins derived from plants in the brassicaceae, including chinese cabbage, were confidently identified . many of these proteins are common in plants and belong to several families of pathogenesis-related proteins . among these, a β- <dig> -glucanase , a type iv chitinase , a thaumatin-like protein  and a peroxidase  were indentified . the mws observed on the gel of the protein bands from which prs were identified are similar to the mws of the predicted proteins, indicating that these plant-derived proteins seem to remain intact in the insect gut lumen. prs are defense-related proteins inducible upon infection with phytopathogenic fungi or bacteria, as well as viruses and even insect attack
 <cit> . most prs can be induced through the action of signaling compounds such as salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, or ethylene and were shown to exhibit antimicrobial activities through either the ability to hydrolyze cell walls or contact toxicity, and may also be involved in defense signaling
 <cit> . the full-length protein sequences of all the prs we identified here possess an amino-terminus signal peptide, indicating that their location in plants is the intercellular space. their compact structure, often stabilized by disulfide bridges, makes prs extremely tough proteins. resistant towards proteolysis and elevated temperature, prs remain soluble at low ph, allowing them to survive in harsh environments, including the gut lumen of insect herbivores
 <cit> .

protein bands  <dig> and  <dig> contain peptides corresponding to polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins  from brassica napus . pgips are glycoproteins associated with the plant cell wall which are believed to play an important role in defense against phytopathogenic fungi. their main function is to target fungal-derived polygalacturonases and reduce their hydrolytic activity towards plant cell wall pectins, resulting in a negative effect on fungal growth
 <cit> . the typical primary structure of pgips comprises an amino-terminal signal peptide for secretion and a mature polypeptide characteristic of proteins from the leucine-rich repeat  superfamily
 <cit> . although pgips are not classified as prs, their expression can also be induced by both biotic  and abiotic  elicitors, and pgips play an active role in plant defense
 <cit> . similar to prs, the protein bands containing peptides corresponding to pgips have mws close to the ones predicted from protein sequences , indicating that these pgips seem to be resistant to proteolysis by insect-derived digestive proteinases. the apparent stability of both prs and pgips in p. cochleariae gut contents together with what is known about their physiological functions indicates that both protein families are potential candidates for plant defense against this herbivorous insect.

identification of pcwdes from p. cochleariae gut contents
to specifically identify insect-derived proteins from the  <dig> protein bands we analyzed, we searched the resulting mass spectrometry data against a p. cochleariae-derived protein database established from transcriptome data generated in-house, and translated in silico in the six possible open reading frames. to improve the significance of our identifications, we merged this database to the swiss-prot protein database. from the  <dig> protein bands analyzed, we positively identified  <dig> insect-derived proteins . out of these,  <dig> correspond to putative pcwdes according to our previous study
 <cit>  and are classified in  <dig> glycoside hydrolase  families based on the cazy nomenclature
 <cit> , gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig> 

xylanase activity was restricted to the flowthrough, therefore proteins corresponding to putative xylan-degrading enzymes should be present in one of the corresponding protein bands we analyzed . proteins known to exhibit xylanase activity are restricted to four gh families  according to cazy
 <cit> , and protein hits for one or more of these enzyme families were expected. indeed, peptides from protein band  <dig> hit two distinct proteins possessing a gh11-conserved domain . one of them, gh11- <dig>  corresponds to a transcript previously identified in p. cochleariae 
 <cit> , whereas gh11- <dig> is new to this study. these two proteins share almost 80% amino acid identity, both harbor a  <dig> amino acid signal peptide at their amino-terminus, and the two predicted catalytic residues  are conserved, indicating that both proteins are potentially active enzymes . no hit for one of the other three gh families was obtained, suggesting that these two gh <dig> enzymes represent our sole candidates for the xylanase activity observed.

pectinase activity was also detected in the flowthrough, but only by diffusion assays and not by zymograms . known pectin-degrading enzymes, or polygalacturonases, are members of a single gh family  according to cazy, and peptides corresponding to protein bands  <dig> and  <dig> gave hits for three distinct proteins with a conserved gh <dig> domain . our diffusion assays  and the zymogram  also indicated that peptides from protein band  <dig> should also hit polygalacturonases, and indeed we identified two additional gh28s . these five gh28s all harbor a signal peptide at their amino-terminus and conserved putative catalytic residues, except for gh28- <dig> for which the third putative catalytic aspartate residue is substituted by an asparagine, suggesting that gh28- <dig> may not be an active enzyme . taking this into account, the polygalacturonase activity detected by zymogram corresponding to protein band  <dig>  may be due only to gh28- <dig>  whereas the activity detected from the flowthrough may represent the common contribution of gh28- <dig>  - <dig> and − <dig>  notably, gh28- <dig> corresponds to a polygalacturonase transcript  from girard & jouanin
 <cit> , except for the presence of four frameshifts compared to the previously described sequence. we believe that our sequence is correct based on the high number of clones we sequenced, and also because the corresponding protein shares 83% amino acid identity with its closest relative in the other chrysomelid chrysomela tremula , whereas the protein corresponding to the previously described sequence shares only 79% with the same accession from c. tremula.

cmcase activity was detected by both diffusion plate assays and zymograms, corresponding to proteins that are bound to the anion exchange chromatography column, centered on the fraction containing protein bands  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . peptides corresponding to protein bands  <dig> and  <dig> hit five proteins harboring a gh <dig> conserved domain present in the p. cochleariae protein database , namely gh45- <dig> and − <dig> from protein band  <dig> and gh45- <dig>  - <dig> and − <dig> from protein band  <dig>  similar to gh11s and gh28s, these proteins possess a signal peptide, and their catalytic residues  are conserved . the conservation between gh45- <dig> and − <dig> is very high; both sequences share  <dig> % amino acid identity, which was also reflected in the ms data we obtained from protein band  <dig>  in fact the lc-mse analysis revealed that in several cases, the same peptide from this protein band matches both sequences; however, four peptides were found to be ‘discriminating’, meaning that they correspond to the same region on both gh45- <dig> and − <dig> where amino acid variations occur. for example, peptide qllvqvtntgsdlgk  matches gh45- <dig>  whereas peptide qmlvqvtntgsdlgk  matches gh45- <dig>  similarly, peptide yggvhteeecnqlpedlqegck  matches gh45- <dig>  whereas peptide itgvqteeecnqlpedlqegck  matches gh45- <dig>  therefore, we can conclude with certainty that both gh45- <dig> and − <dig> are present in protein band  <dig>  and that matches to one or the other do not represent a false positive identification . again, notably, gh45- <dig> corresponds to a previously described sequence 
 <cit> , except for the presence of four frameshifts. our sequence shares 69% amino acid identity with its closest relative in leptinotarsa decemlineata , whereas the previously described sequence shares only 64% with the same sequence in l. decemlineata. taking this into account together with the number of clones we sequenced, we believe that our sequence is correct.

identification of insect-derived proteins other than pcwdes
together with the  <dig> protein identifications for pcwdes, we obtained four hits for other insect-derived proteins . among these, two proteins from other gh families were identified: one with a gh <dig> conserved domain and the other one with a gh <dig> conserved domain. gh16- <dig> is very similar to lepidopteran and termite-derived β- <dig> -glucanases for which the function is still controversial. in fact, these enzymes have been implicated in the digestion of β- <dig> -glucans found in fungal cell walls and been found to be part of the immune system of lepidoptera and termites
 <cit> . peptides from protein band  <dig> matched to a partial sequence corresponding to a putative β-glucosidase . aside from the obvious role of gh <dig> proteins in digestion
 <cit> , a member of this family in the cabbage aphid, brevicoryne brassicae, has been functionally characterized as a myrosinase
 <cit> . myrosinases have been extensively studied in plants from the family brassicaceae because these enzymes mediate the hydrolysis of glucosinolates, the main secondary metabolites found in these plants, leading to a labile aglycone, which rapidly undergoes spontaneous rearrangement to yield a variety of toxic metabolites such as isothiocyanates, thiocyanates, cyanoepithioalkanes and nitriles. plant myrosinases and glucosinolates constitute a system in cruciferous plants that defends against pests  and diseases. insect-derived myrosinase may play a role that is similar to the role it plays in plants, protecting crucifer-feeding insects against predation by making them distasteful, due to the hydrolysis of glucosinolates present in their diet
 <cit> . phaedon cochleariae feeds exclusively on plants from the family brassicaceae, and although the presence of a myrosinase activity has not been yet identified in this species, the hypothesis that such enzyme is present cannot be excluded.

additionally, two other non-pcwde proteins have been identified: one, a cysteine proteinase, and the other, a putative 3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase. beetles from the infraorder cucujiformia rely mainly on cathepsin-type cysteine proteinases to digest proteins, with little contribution from serine proteinases 
 <cit> ; therefore their presence in p. cochleariae is to be expected. the presence of other cathepsins in protein bands which were not examined here is also to be expected. the presence in p. cochleariae gut contents of a putative 3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase, an enzyme implicated in lipid metabolism in peroxisomes, is difficult to understand. the substrate for this enzyme is expected to occur only intracellularly. the predicted protein does not harbor a signal peptide at its amino-terminus and therefore should not be secreted by the canonical pathway. we presume that it may be released into the lumen by occasional cell breakage or as an "accidental" passenger in an exocytotic pathway, and that persists in the lumen due to resistance to proteases. an analogous example from lepidoptera is arginine kinase, found in the gut lumen of species such as helicoverpa armigera <cit>  and plodia interpunctella <cit>  where it has been shown to be a human allergen.

co-isolation of p. cochleariae pcwdes and host-plant-derived proteins
a very interesting observation from our proteomic analyses is the finding of both insect-derived pgs and plant-derived pgips in the same fraction from the anion exchange chromatography and even the same protein band . their presence in the same protein bands in the gel  could be attributed to their highly similar molecular weight. on the other hand, it is unlikely that their physico-chemical properties are so similar that they show the same anion exchange behavior; thus their occurrence in exactly the same fractions from the anion exchange chromatography suggests a binding interaction in vivo. pgips occur as a multigene family in plants, two members are found in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana <cit>  and up to nine members in the recently sequenced genome of brassica rapa <cit> . these proteins have been extensively studied for their role in defense against fungal pathogens
 <cit> , but their ability to inhibit insect-derived polygalacturonase activity has also been described. for example, polygalacturonase activity from two mirid bugs, lygus rugulipennis and adelphocoris lineolatus, is strongly inhibited by two pgips  from the common bean phaseolus vulgaris <cit> . similarly, an endopolygalacturonase purified from the sugarcane rootstalk borer weevil, diaprepes abbreviatus, is inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by a semi-purified pgip from orange flavedo
 <cit> . altogether, this indicates that pgips from chinese cabbage , the plant we used to feed p. cochleariae, may play an active role in defense against this insect by inhibiting one or several of its polygalacturonases. at this stage of our analysis, we do not know which of the pgs  binds the pgip protein we identified from the flowthrough. the same applies to the pgip identified in the same fraction from the anion exchange chromatography as gh28- <dig> and − <dig>  to address this uncertainty, experiments testing the direct binding of pgips to individual p. cochleariae-derived pgs need to be performed. what we can note, however, is that p. cochleariae may have partially overcome this line of plant defense, as polygalacturonase activity can still be detected in its gut contents  after feeding on b. rapa, which may contribute to adaptation to one of its host plants.

survey of the p. cochleariae transcriptome for putative pcwde transcripts
using sequence similarities and blast searches, we identified  <dig> transcripts encoding putative pcwdes in the p. cochleariae transcriptome we generated from pooled mrna of all larval and adult tissues. two encode putative xylanases , nine, putative polygalacturonases , and eight, putative cellulases . one, named gh45- <dig>  is most likely a pseudogene, as the open reading frame is interrupted by a premature stop codon. all the other  <dig> transcripts potentially encode putatively secreted functional proteins, as they all harbor an amino-terminal signal peptide. this is in contrast to the number of identifications we obtained from the proteomic analysis. although the proteins corresponding to the two xylanase transcripts were identified, only five out of nine gh <dig> and five out of seven gh45s could be identified. three hypotheses could account for these observed discrepancies between the number of proteins identified based on their enzymatic activity and the number of putative transcripts from the transcriptome. first, some of these transcripts could be expressed in tissues other than the insect gut. second, the expression of some of these transcripts may be very low in ‘normal’ feeding conditions, for example, when the insect feeds on a plant to which it is highly adapted. third, the proteins may be present in gut contents but were not identified because they do not degrade the substrates that we tested.

to evaluate these three possibilities, we first performed quantitative real-time pcr experiments in which we compared the expression of these  <dig> transcripts in the gut tissue compared to the expression of transcripts in the rest of the insect body . without exception, all putative pcwde transcripts are specifically expressed in the gut compared to the rest of the body; therefore, we rejected the first hypothesis. for insight into the expression levels of each individual putative pcwde-encoding transcript, we mapped all rna-seq reads of the p. cochleariae transcriptome to these transcripts using a mapping and quantification tool . these reads came from four ‘pools’, larval gut and rest body, as well as adult gut and rest body. this analysis clearly showed that all transcripts are predominantly expressed in the insect gut rather than the rest of the body, confirming the results we obtained from quantitative real-time pcr experiments. moreover, these data show that there is almost no difference in the expression of these genes in larvae and in adults, which we also hypothesized as both developmental stages have the same feeding regimen . likewise, proteins corresponding to gh <dig> and gh45-encoding transcripts with the highest expression were identified in our proteomics approach, the top three for gh28s and the top two for gh <dig>  in contrast, the proteins corresponding to the two gh <dig> transcripts and one gh <dig> transcript displaying the lowest expression in the rna-seq analysis could not be identified in our proteomics approach. these low mrna expression levels are most likely also reflected at the protein level. the expression of both gh28- <dig> and − <dig> is about  <dig> times lower than that of gh28- <dig>  the most highly expressed gh <dig>  similarly, the expression of gh45- <dig> is about  <dig> times lower than that of gh45- <dig>  however, in contrast, the apparent absence from the gut content proteome of gh28- <dig> and − <dig>  as well as of gh45- <dig> cannot be correlated with the expression level of their corresponding transcripts, which partially invalidates our second hypothesis. finally, we had a closer look at the amino acid sequences of all putative pcwdes. in all cases except one, gh28- <dig>  putative catalytic residues were detected . as noted above, a substitution of a catalytic aspartate residue to an asparagine occurred in gh28-3; nonetheless, the corresponding protein could be identified from protein band  <dig>  indicating that although gh28- <dig> is most likely not an active polygalacturonase, it may have evolved another function in p. cochleariae. the only way for us to determine whether a given enzyme possesses the proposed activity is by functional characterization, which represents one of our future objectives.

alength of the full length coding dna sequences  in base pairs. bsequences were generated from four independent rna pools: larval gut , larval rest body , adult gut  and adult rest body . cabsolute numbers of reads mapped to each orf corresponding to a putative pcwde for each specific rna pool. dthe number of reads per kilobase and per million  are log <dig> transformed . * indicates that the corresponding proteins were identified from the proteomic analysis.

we clearly demonstrated that transcripts encoding putative pcwdes are actively expressed in the gut tissue, suggesting that the corresponding proteins should be present in gut contents. however, we cannot yet exclude the possibility that the respective proteins get trapped after secretion, either in the glycocalyx present at the surface of gut cells or in the peritrophic matrix before they could reach the gut lumen
 <cit> . the peritrophic matrix is a hollow meshwork tube of chitinous fibres cross-linked by proteins which have several well-described functions in insects, such as protecting the gut epithelium against physical damages or infection and compartmentalizing digestive processes, and trapping digestive enzymes and other proteins
 <cit> . further proteome analyses targeting these two compartments of the insect gut need to be performed to address thisx issue.

finally, we also cannot exclude the possibility that the pcwdes that were not identified after the proteomics approach could indeed be present in the  <dig> protein bands we analyzed by mass spectrometry; but that technical limitation of mass spectrometry itself prevented their identification. in fact, protein identification by mass spectrometry is conditioned by the fact that tryptic peptides must be ionized to be fully analyzed. in other words, only peptides that were properly ionized are considered for database searches. in addition, although we already considered some peptide modifications for our database searches, such as carbamidation of cysteines or oxidation of methionines, other types of modifications can occur and impair database searches and protein identifications. among these, n-linked glycosylation, which is a common feature of secreted proteins and of the putative pcwdes we identified , can dramatically change the apparent ion masses of tryptic peptides and prevent protein identification.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that combining transcriptomics and proteomics represents a powerful approach for protein discovery and enables confident identifications to be made in non-model insects, such as the mustard leaf beetle p. cochleariae. we found that several putative pcwde genes found in phytophagous beetles encode functional enzymes. it is now clear that the overall degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides, at least in p. cochleariae, is due to multiple members of several gene families of insect-derived enzymes rather than single members of several gene families, as previously thought
 <cit> . although transcriptome sequencing by itself represents a very efficient method for gene discovery, we believe that attributing a function and/or annotating a gene based only on sequence similarities, without performing any kind of functional characterization, is generally insufficient and may lead to a false interpretation of the physiological role of a given protein or protein family. consequently, our next task will consist of functionally characterizing every single putative pcwde we identified here. finally, our data indicated that, although the insect digestive system is very efficient in digesting plant material, some host plant-derived proteins remain stable and resist proteolysis. the identification and characterization of these highly resistant plant proteins, as well as their potential targets within the insect digestive system, may provide crucial information on key aspects of the ‘arms race’ between the insect and its host plant.
