BACKGROUND
all above-ground plant organs originate from the shoot apical meristem, which is established during embryogenesis  <cit> . within the shoot meristem, the central zone contains three layers of slowly dividing pluripotent stem cells, which respectively give rise to the epidermis, subepidermal cells, and internal tissues. stem cell daughters enter differentiation pathways in the surrounding peripheral zone, where lateral organs are initiated, and in the underlying rib zone, where the pith of the shoot is formed  <cit> .

several key regulators of stem cell maintenance have been identified in the past, including a feedback loop between stem cells and underlying niche cells, named the organizing center  <cit> ; regulation of cytokinin synthesis and response  <cit> ; and localized expression of mirnas  <cit> . the argonaute <dig>  gene is required for stem cell maintenance during embryogenesis and for initiation of axillary meristems during postembryonic development. loss of ago <dig> function in the landsberg erecta  accession results in stem cells differentiating into a flat apex, leaf-like structures, or normal-appearing leaves  <cit> . expression of the stem cell marker clavata  <dig>  is correctly initiated at the transition embryo stage of the zll- <dig> mutant, but is discontinued at the bent-cotyledon embryo stage  <cit> . ago <dig> encodes a member of the ago protein family that binds small rnas and acts as effectors of rna interference in plants and animals  <cit> . in contrast to canonical ago proteins, however, binding of mir165/ <dig> to ago <dig> does not result in degradation of the target mrnas, encoding hdzip iii transcription factors, but in their increase. therefore, a function of ago <dig> as a decoy ago protein, which limits loading of mir165/ <dig> onto ago <dig> and thus reduces degradation of hdzip iii mrnas, has been proposed  <cit> .

one of the earliest events in organ initiation by the shoot meristem is the accumulation of auxin via directional cell-to-cell transport . auxin can trigger the degradation of aux/iaa repressor proteins and consequently the activation of auxin response factors  transcription factors  <cit> . the arabidopsis genome contains  <dig> arfs  <cit> , specific subsets of which regulate a multitude of developmental processes . the stem cell-containing central domain of the meristem appears relatively insensitive to auxin  <cit>  and displays increased mechanical stiffness; these factors have been suggested to limit organ formation  <cit> .

the initiation of differentiated organs in the place of the stem cells in zll mutants raises the question whether ago <dig> might negatively regulate auxin function. to address this question, we analyzed the interplay between ago <dig> and auxin during embryogenesis. our results show that ago <dig> downregulates both auxin signaling and auxin response, including expression of arf <dig>  downregulation of arf <dig> levels in zll- <dig> embryos via an artificial mirna  recovers stem cell maintenance. furthermore, increased rev activity in zll- <dig> restores arf <dig> repression and stem cell maintenance. together, these results provide a framework of how ago <dig> maintains shoot meristem stem cells by negatively regulating auxin signaling.

RESULTS
auxin signaling and response are increased in zll- <dig> embryos
to address whether auxin regulation might be altered in zll- <dig> mutants, we first monitored auxin response with the pdr5:nlsgfp reporter . in wild-type embryogenesis, pdr5:gfp expression was detected from the globular stage onwards at the root pole and additionally from the heart stage onwards in the tips and developing vasculature of the cotyledons. in zll- <dig> embryos, pdr5:gfp expression levels were increased in all regions where expression was found in wild type. additional expression was detected in the vasculature of the embryo axis of early heart to torpedo stage embryos and in the epidermis of cotyledonary tips of transition to heart stage embryos.fig.  <dig> auxin response is enhanced in zll- <dig> mutant embryos. upper two lanes show overlays of dr5:gfp signal and differential interference contrast images. images were taken at the same settings. in the bottom two lanes, the corresponding heat maps of dr5:gfp expression are shown. rainbow gradient from blue  to red  is used. scale bars: 15 μm, except for bent-cotyledon stage, 30 μm. genotypes and embryo stages are indicated



to investigate what causes the increased dr5:gfp response in zll- <dig>  we first monitored expression of the tandem auxin signaling sensor r2d <dig>  <cit> , where the prps5a:dii-n3xvenus  signal is inversely correlated to auxin signaling and where the prps5a:mdii-ntdtomato  signal acts as transcription control. in addition, a pclv3:er-cfp transgene was used to monitor shoot meristem stem cells.

in wild-type transition to torpedo stage embryos, expression of the prps5a:mdii-ntdtomato reporter was detectable in the cotyledons and at a lower level in the shoot apex and the basal part . in bent-cotyledon stage embryos, the mdii-ntdtomato signal was close to background level in the majority of the analyzed embryos . this indicates that the prps5a driver is active in wild-type embryogenesis until the torpedo stage. expression of the prps5a:dii-n3xvenus auxin signaling reporter was detectable in a similar pattern between the transition and the torpedo stages . as expected, no signal was detectable in bent-cotyledon stage embryos, where the driver is not active .fig.  <dig> auxin signaling is elevated in zll- <dig> embryos. a expression of the stem cell markers pclv3:ercfp, prps5a:mdii-ntdtomato , and prps5a:dii-n3xvenus  in embryos at the indicated stages and genotypes. the ercfp signal was recorded with  <dig>  ms exposure time, ntdtomato with 400 ms, and dii-venus with  <dig>  ms for all samples. the cfp signal is shown in blue, dii-venus in yellow, and ntdtomato in red. scale bars: 10 μm for transition to heart stages, 30 μm for torpedo and bent-cotyledon stages. b dii-venus to ntdtomato signal ratios during embryogenesis. ***p < <dig> ; n.s. not significant



in the zll- <dig> mutant, the expression of prps5a:mdii-ntdtomato did not show any detectable difference compared to wild type , demonstrating that the prps5a driver works as in wild type. in contrast to wild type, however, the dii-venus signal was not detectable in the majority of zll- <dig> embryos from transition to torpedo stages , indicating increased auxin signaling. we notice that this embryo-wide downregulation of the dii-venus reporter in zll- <dig> embryos contrasted the localized upregulation of dr5:gfp expression . this difference might be due to the reported higher sensitivity of dii-venus compared to dr <dig>  <cit>  and the different molecular requirements of the two auxin markers: dii-venus relies on the presence of the transport inhibitor response <dig>  f-box protein family and on the presence of auxin itself , and dr <dig> relies additionally on the presence of arf transcription factors. one mechanistic interpretation of the different patterns of both reporters is that increased early signaling does not always result in arf2-dependent transcriptional activities.

tir <dig> and auxin signaling f-box 1– <dig>  auxin receptor mrnas are targets of mir <dig>  <cit> , which has been found to preferentially bind to ago <dig>  <cit>  and thus could be sensitive to the levels of ago <dig>  notably, we found that afb <dig> mrna levels were slightly increased compared to wild type in zll- <dig> torpedo stage embryos and tir <dig> and afb <dig> mrna levels in zll- <dig> bent-cotyledon stage embryos . thus, the observed decrease in dii-venus signal could be partially due to the increase of tir/afb expression.fig.  <dig> auxin biosynthesis and receptor gene expression is upregulated in zll- <dig> embryos. mrna levels were determined by qrt-pcr of receptor genes  and biosynthesis genes  relative to the reference gene at4g <dig> and standard deviations of three biological replicates are shown. student’s t-test was used to calculate p-values. *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> 



in arabidopsis, the main source of auxin is from tryptophan via two enzymatic steps, catalyzed by tryptophan amino transferases   <cit>  and the yucca  family monooxygenases  <cit> . we found that the expression of yuc <dig> and yuc <dig> was weakly upregulated in the zll- <dig> mutant compared to wild type , whereas taa <dig> and tar <dig> expression was not significantly changed .

in summary, these results indicate that between transition and torpedo stages, zll- <dig> embryos display higher levels of auxin synthesis and signaling compared to wild type.

arf <dig> levels in zll- <dig> mediate stem cell termination
we next asked whether increased auxin signaling might contribute to the shoot meristem defects in zll- <dig> mutants through arf auxin effector genes. for an initial characterization we chose arf <dig> as a tas3-regulated arf gene  <cit> , and arf <dig> as a mir167-regulated arf gene  <cit> , which are expressed during embryogenesis but not in the embryonic shoot apex  <cit> . because no loss-of-function mutants were available in the ler ecotype, we downregulated arf <dig> and arf <dig> mrna levels via artificial mirnas . changing arf <dig> expression had no effect on shoot meristem formation in wild type or in zll- <dig>  and was not further pursued.

expression of p35s:amir-arf <dig> strongly reduced arf <dig> mrna levels detected by semi-quantitative reverse rranscriptase polymerase chain reaction  in torpedo stage embryos , but did not have any effect on the shoot meristem development in wild type , in accordance with previous findings  <cit> . by contrast, in zll- <dig> bent-cotyledon stage embryos, p35s:amir-arf <dig> expression partially rescued stem cell maintenance as measured by the expression of the stem cell marker pclv3:gfp-er  and the presence of an active shoot meristem at the seedling stage .fig.  <dig> stem cell maintenance in zll- <dig> is restored by reduced arf <dig> and increased rev levels. a sqrt-pcr shows that arf <dig> transcript levels are strongly downregulated, whereas arf <dig> and arf <dig> transcripts are unchanged in two independent p35s:amir-arf <dig> zll- <dig> lines compared to untransformed zll- <dig>  b expression of the shoot meristem stem cell marker pclv3:gfp-er  is discontinued in zll- <dig> embryos at the bent-cotyledon stage, but recovered in zll- <dig> expressing p35s:amir-arf <dig> and in zll- <dig> rev-10d double mutants. scale bars: 20 μm. c percentage of pclv3:gfp-er expression levels in given genotypes during embryo development. n number of embryos analyzed. p-values were calculated by the chi-square test: **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> 



in the converse experiment, we upregulated arf <dig> mrna levels by expressing a tas3-resistant parf2:arf2m transgene in order to avoid degradation of arf <dig> mrna via the tas <dig> sirna. in the zll- <dig> background, this resulted in a significant  reduction of pclv3:gfp-er expression in bent-cotyledon stage and mature embryos  and of shoot meristem maintenance . in addition, the severity of shoot meristem defects was enhanced . by contrast, parf2:arf2m expression did not cause any obvious phenotypic change in the shoot apical meristem when expressed in the wild type . this suggests that arf <dig> levels are not a limiting factor in shoot meristem maintenance in wild type, but are in zll- <dig>  consistent with the increased auxin accumulation in zll- <dig> fig.  <dig> 
zll- <dig> stem cell defects are enhanced by increased arf <dig> levels. a

together these results suggest that downregulation of arf <dig> expression is required for shoot meristem stem cell maintenance during embryogenesis by ago <dig> activity.

revoluta mediates downregulation of arf <dig> expression by ago10
one possible reason why reduction of arf <dig> activity suppresses shoot meristem termination in zll- <dig> embryos is that ago <dig> negatively regulates arf <dig> expression levels. indeed, we found by qrt-pcr that arf <dig> mrna levels were 3–4-fold increased in zll- <dig> torpedo stage embryos compared to wild type, whereas arf <dig> and arf <dig> levels were not affected .fig.  <dig>

next we analyzed expression of the transcriptional reporter parf2:nlstd-tomato  during embryogenesis. in wild type, parf2:ntdtomato was hardly detectable from heart to torpedo stages and was detected throughout the embryo at the bent-cotyledon stage . by contrast, in zll- <dig> heart to bent-cotyledon stage embryos, parf2:ntdtomato was uniformly expressed at higher levels compared to wild type . we note that this expression pattern differs from the one reported in the columbia accession  <cit> , which could be due to different arf <dig> expression levels in the ler accession used in our experiments.

in summary, these data indicate that ago <dig> is required to downregulate arf <dig> transcription from heart to torpedo stages throughout the embryo.

ago <dig> prevents accumulation of mir165/ <dig> in the embryonic shoot meristem and thus promotes expression of their target hd-zip iii genes  <cit> . we therefore asked whether hd-zip iii activity might mediate repression of arf <dig> transcription via ago <dig>  to this end we introgressed the mir-resistant rev-10d mutation  <cit> , which as a single mutant does not display any shoot meristem defect , into the zll- <dig> mutant. this resulted in a significant rescue of shoot meristem formation in zll- <dig> embryos , including the expression of the stem cell marker pclv3:gfp-er .

qrt-pcr studies demonstrated that the rev-10d mutation largely suppressed the upregulation of arf <dig> mrna levels in the zll- <dig> mutant , and that inducible p35s:gr-revd activity repressed arf <dig> expression . addition of cycloheximide abolished the effect of rev on arf <dig> mrna , indicating that it is indirect. likewise, rev-10d suppressed the expression levels of the arf <dig> transcriptional reporter in zll- <dig> embryos .

taken together, this indicates that ago <dig> represses arf <dig> transcription in the embryonic shoot meristem through rev activity.

discussion
during embryonic shoot meristem formation, the two basic functions of the meristem need to be established in spatially separated domains: stem cell maintenance in the meristem center, and organ initiation in the periphery  <cit> . several mutants of shoot meristem development result in an inactive stem cell pool, resulting in a terminated apex without the initiation of an organ . by contrast, zll mutant embryos frequently form a leaf structure in place of the stem cell pool in the meristem center  <cit> . this defect first becomes visible at the bent-cotyledon embryo stage when zll- <dig> embryos are unable to maintain expression of the shoot meristem stem cell marker clv <dig>  <cit> . in this study, we have addressed the underlying mechanisms of this phenotype and analyzed the role of auxin and ago <dig> interaction in stem cell maintenance.

ago <dig> negatively regulates auxin signaling and response during embryogenesis
our results provide several lines of evidence that increased auxin function in zll- <dig> contributes to the failure to maintain shoot meristem stem cells in the embryo, as detected by the loss of clv <dig> expression and the ectopic organ formation in place of the stem cells. first, the perception capacities and auxin levels were elevated in the zll- <dig> mutant throughout the embryo. second, reduction of arf <dig> levels partially suppressed stem cell termination in zll- <dig>  whereas increased arf <dig> levels increased stem cell defects.

in protoplast transfection assays, arf <dig> acts as transcriptional repressor of dr5:gus  <cit> , which would suggest that upregulation of dr5:gfp in zll- <dig> is not a direct response of elevated arf <dig> levels and therefore other factors are probably involved. we consistently found that, in addition to arf <dig>  other components of auxin response, such as tir1/afb and yuc genes, were upregulated in zll- <dig> mutants, albeit at weaker levels.

how is the upregulation of arf <dig> accomplished? previous studies showed that ago <dig> promotes expression of the transcription factor rev by blocking degradation of its mrna via mir165/ <dig>  <cit> . our results show that, in turn, rev mediates downregulation of arf <dig> by ago <dig>  because increased rev levels in the zll- <dig> mutant reduced arf <dig> expression and suppressed stem cell defects in the zll- <dig> mutant. it is likely that arf <dig> repression by rev is not direct, because repression did not take place when protein synthesis was blocked. consistent with this notion, rev was not found to bind to arf <dig> in a genome-wide map of rev binding sites  <cit> . curiously, a previous study showed that overexpression of rev in seedlings directly activates expression of auxin biosynthesis genes of the tryptophan-dependent indole-3-pyruvic acid biosynthetic pathway, taa <dig> and yuc <dig>  <cit> . in our studies, however, we found that yuc <dig> and yuc <dig> levels and possibly auxin accumulation were upregulated in zll- <dig> embryos, suggesting that ago <dig> affects auxin synthesis by a mechanism independent of rev, or that rev acts differentially on auxin synthesis during embryo and seedling development.

these findings indicate that ago <dig> is required to reduce auxin activity in the embryo and that this process is essential for maintaining shoot meristem stem cells  <cit> .

genetic interaction studies and expression experiments indicate that ago <dig> is required to potentiate wus-mediated maintenance of clv <dig> expression in the embryonic shoot meristem stem cells  <cit> . in contrast to wus, which is confined to the developing shoot meristem region, ago <dig> is expressed in a broader pattern, including the shoot meristem and the pro-vasculature  <cit> . however, localized expression of ago <dig> in the vasculature is sufficient for shoot meristem development, suggesting that ago <dig> can act non-cell autonomously. consistent with the broad ago <dig> expression pattern in embryos, we found enhanced auxin signaling and response and increased arf expression throughout the zll- <dig> embryo. because organ initiation in the shoot meristem requires the accumulation of auxin at the initiation site through directional transport from surrounding tissues  <cit> , one interesting question to be answered in the future is whether stem cell loss in zll- <dig> embryos is the consequence of enhanced auxin activity inside or outside the shoot meristem.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we show that the argonaute family member ago <dig> negatively regulates auxin signaling during embryogenesis. consequently, the conversion of stem cells into an ectopic leaf-like organ in the zll- <dig> mutant appears to be due to upregulated auxin activity involving increased transcription of the auxin response factor arf <dig>
