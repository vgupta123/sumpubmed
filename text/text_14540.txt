BACKGROUND
potyviruses represent about 20 % of known plant viruses and are economically among the most important threat for vegetable and fruit trees crop species. among them, plum pox virus  infects prunus species  and causes sharka disease which devastates fruit and plant production, significantly impacting crop quality and yield. over the last 30 years, sharka costs to the industry worldwide have been estimated at  <dig> billion euros  <cit> . unfortunately, only a few sources of natural resistance are available in prunus hosts. in order to expand the range and understand the nature of resistance sources, we are investigating new resistances to ppv in the model host plant arabidopsis thaliana.

arabidopsis is commonly used for the acquisition of knowledge on basic plant biology and on adaptation to biotic or abiotic stress. its small size, rapid life cycle and small genome size of ~150 mb make it an ideal model plant for biotechnological and genetical characterization of plant disease resistance. moreover arabidopsis is susceptible to various viral pathogens such as potyviruses  or ppv), cucumoviruses , luteoviruses  and others, making it an ideal host for the identification of genes underlying susceptibility or resistance to viral infection  <cit> .

indeed, three distinct mechanisms of resistance to the ppv and lmv potyviruses have recently been identified in arabidopsis , two of which show a recessive genetic determinism. viruses are obligatory intracellular parasites highjacking the host cell machinery to complete the different steps of their infectious cycle. the disruption of compatible interactions between host and viral factors during replication or translation  of the viral genome may lead to the failure of the corresponding infection step, operationally resulting in a recessive resistance  <cit> . this kind of resistance seems to be more frequent for plant/potyvirus pathosystems, representing 40 % of the resistances identified, up to now, in the natural diversity of crop species. it is worth noting that most of the studies on recessive resistance to potyviruses published to date identified genes encoding the translation initiation factors eif4e and eif4g or their isoforms  <cit> .

recessive resistances against ppv and another potyvirus, watermelon mosaic virus , were identified in the ‘cape verde island’ arabidopsis ecotype  following mechanical inoculation. these resistances were mapped to the same interval on chromosome  <dig>  <cit>  and the corresponding genes were respectively named rpv <dig> and rwm <dig>  in the case of rwm <dig>  a chloroplast phosphoglycerate kinase  has recently been identified as responsible for wmv resistance  <cit> . this cytosolic isozyme of chloroplastic pgk is a ubiquitous monomeric enzyme that can also play roles in dna repair  <cit>  or, in the case of the paramyxovirus sendai virus, in stimulation of mrna transcription during the elongation step  <cit> . in plants, it was shown that lowering cpgk levels reduced the accumulation of bamboo mosaic virus , a member of potexvirus genus  <cit> .

another recessive resistance against ppv has been identified among arabidopsis accessions of diverse origins following agrobacterium-mediated inoculation  <cit> . it was designated sha <dig> for “sharka resistance” and appears to be unlinked to rpv <dig> as it maps at the bottom of linkage group  <dig>  variation at the sha <dig> locus restricts ppv long distance movement and viral systemic infection  <cit> . in the present study, genetic analysis and linkage mapping of recombinant inbred line  populations and genome wide association mapping in a multiparental population were used to demonstrate the existence of rpv <dig> resistance alleles in both cvi- <dig> and col- <dig> and to identify cpgk <dig> as the cellular gene underlying this resistance to ppv in arabidopsis. we also confirm that the rpv1-driven tendency to escape ppv infection is distinct from the sha <dig> resistance mechanism and that it is specific to the method of inoculation.

RESULTS
testing different inoculation methods on the cvi- <dig>  col- <dig> and ler arabidopsis accessions
arabidopsis thaliana can be experimentally inoculated with plum pox virus  using different methods: i) mechanically  <cit> , ii) by biolistics  <cit>  and iii) by agroinoculation  <cit> . in the first case, the virus is delivered as an encapsidated virion while purified dna molecules are transferred by agrobacterium or shooting. to test the effect of the inoculation method  on the outcome of the arabidopsis/ppv interactions, several accessions were inoculated in parallel with the three methods described in the material and methods’ section. the accumulation of ppv-r in the ler, cvi- <dig> and col- <dig> accessions was estimated at 21 days post inoculation  by elisa. surprisingly, while the three accessions are fully susceptible to ppv infection after biolistic  or agroinoculation, both cvi- <dig> and col- <dig> showed a constant tendency to escape systemic infection when inoculated mechanically . indeed, viral accumulation was detected in only  <dig> to 35 % of inoculated plants. according to lecocq et al.  <cit> , partial resistance is, in some cases, based on the tendency to escape infection and may be characterized as a lower probability of infection than that of susceptible plants, using the same level of inoculum, which is the case for cvi- <dig> and col- <dig> when mechanically infected by ppv. this observed phenotype in response to ppv infection will thus be named “partial resistance”, hereafter.fig.  <dig> percentage of infected plants among susceptible  and partially resistant  accessions following agroinoculation  or mechanical inoculation . the results presented are those of representative experiments involving  <dig> to  <dig> arabidopsis plants per condition. the infection status was determined by an elisa assays performed on non-inoculated tissues 21 days post inoculation



we also checked if the phenotype observed was linked to a true, partial resistance mechanism or if the infected plants carried a ppv variant that had evolved the ability to overcome the col- <dig> resistance. we carried out serial passage of ppv into col- <dig> as described in the material and methods section. in the two replicate experiments, ppv infection rate in the back inoculated col- <dig> plants reached only  <dig>  to  <dig>  %, demonstrating the stability of the resistance phenotype. it thus appears that the partial block in ppv systemic infection in arabidopsis dependent on the inoculation method is stable, and that this partial resistance in cvi- <dig> and col- <dig> is observed only when plants are mechanically inoculated. this resistance is overcome upon biolistic or agrobacterium-mediated inoculation. cvi- <dig> had previously been shown to be resistant to ppv upon mechanical inoculation and the locus involved, rpv <dig>  mapped to a chromosome  <dig> interval  <cit> .

genome wide association mapping of arabidopsis resistance after mechanical inoculation
we recently showed using a larger set of arabidopsis accessions that resistance to ppv inoculated by agrobacterium is controlled by a different locus, named sha  <dig> gene  <cit> . in an effort to evaluate that the rpv <dig> resistance is unrelated to the sha <dig> ppv resistance locus, a set of  <dig> arabidopsis accessions  previously used to identify sha <dig> was mechanically inoculated with ppv. the experiment was duplicated and the broad-sense heritability, calculated as described in material and methods, of ppv resistance reached  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

fisher’s exact test identified snps significantly linked to resistance to ppv. notably,  <dig> of the  <dig> snps  with the lowest p-values were located on chromosome one. this region coincides with a previously identified locus associated to resistance to ppv mechanical inoculation in the cvi- <dig> accession and named rpv <dig>  <cit> . when using the quantitative data ,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> snps, out of the  <dig> snps with the lowest p-values, belong to the same rpv <dig> genomic region, with the wilcoxon, plink and emma methods, respectively . in addition, snps localized to the sha <dig> interval were also detected among the  <dig> most significant snps, thereby confirming that both rpv1- and sha3-driven resistance mechanisms are present, concomitantly, in the population of natural arabidopsis accessions. however, since we cannot rule out that spurious, false positive association may arise from population structure, a traditional linkage mapping in recombinant inbred line populations was conducted, in order to confirm and fine map rpv <dig> 

linkage mapping of resistance to ppv systemic accumulation after mechanical inoculation of an arabidopsis multiparental recombinant population
four hundred and thirty-five of the  <dig> magic  recombinant inbred lines described by kover et al.  <cit>  were evaluated in a three random blocks design following a mechanical inoculation. a significant block effect was detected and a qtl mapping analysis was performed using data from each block separately, as well as using a lsmeans model, accounting for the effect of each block. the broad-sense heritability of ppv resistance for the magic lines was calculated from the variance analysis  and reached  <dig> . interestingly, the same genomic region was identified when using data from block one and three separately or from the mean values of the three blocks. analysis of the variation in susceptibility to ppv infection for the first and third block identified one qtl on linkage group  <dig> at position  <dig> ,790 bp  =  <dig> ) and  <dig> ,231 bp  =  <dig> ), respectively. by using lsmeans values, a major qtl was identified in the same genomic region as for blocks  <dig> and  <dig>  with a maxima of the -log <dig>  of  <dig>  . this region coincides with rpv <dig>  surprisingly, even if point wise p-values were significant at the 1 % level, this analysis failed to identify the sha <dig> ppv resistance locus which had previously been identified in the same magic rils population using agrobacterium-mediated ppv inoculation  <cit> . from the qtl analysis of the magic lines, the genome of each line was reconstructed as a mosaic of the founder haplotypes  <cit> . based on this reconstruction, it was possible to determine that the three founders contributing the qtl detected in the magic lines were col- <dig>  can- <dig> and ws. in comparison, ppv agro-inoculation of the same magic lines had shown that the sha <dig> resistance was contributed by two unrelated founders, hi- <dig> and sf- <dig>  <cit> .table  <dig> identification of arabidopsis genomic regions controlling restriction of ppv infection in bi- and multi-parental populations

these results therefore suggest that different resistance genes may be uncovered when using different inoculation methods. the differences observed using the two inoculation methods could be due to either 1) a larger genetic effect of rpv <dig> over sha <dig> that would hide the relative effect of the second mechanism when using mechanical inoculation, 2) a loss of the sha3-driven resistance when using mechanical inoculation or, alternatively, a loss of the rpv1-driven resistance upon agroinoculation, or 3) a difference in timing, i.e. rpv1-driven resistance taking place earlier in the viral life cycle than the sha3-driven mechanism. in order to test the first hypothesis, the analysis was repeated removing the magic lines that possess a higher probability of having the genotype of the resistant founders in the rpv <dig> region. the recalculated point wise p-value at the sha <dig> locus was decreased, suggesting that removing partially the effect of the rpv <dig> locus improved the detection of the sha <dig> locus . therefore, even if the sha <dig> qtl was difficult to detect when plants were mechanically inoculated, resistance to ppv systemic infection in the magic lines appears to be controlled by at least two different loci, rpv <dig> and sha <dig>  respectively.

linkage mapping of the rpv1-driven resistance trait in the recombinant jeaxcol- <dig> population
in order to confirm the occurrence of rpv <dig> in the col- <dig> background, two distinct sets of biparental jea × col- <dig> recombinant inbred line population were mechanically challenged with ppv, in a completely randomized design in four independent blocks. these sets were constituted of  <dig> and  <dig> individuals, respectively. the experiment on the set of  <dig> rils was repeated twice over two years.

results show that variances are not significantly heterogeneous in all experiments , and results of an anova test confirmed that the block design had no significant effect on viral infection . as a consequence, the qtl analysis was performed on pooled blocks results, using the mapqtl and rqtl softwares. a kruskal-wallis test was first performed, to detect markers linked to the resistance to ppv. an approximate lod score was then computed through interval mapping. table 1b summarizes krustal -wallis p-values and lod scores for each qtl. in the  <dig> rils experiment, the effect of only one locus was observed, with a lod score of  <dig>  and a r <dig> of  <dig>  %. this single locus is located on chromosome one, between  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm  , the same region previously identified in cvi- <dig>  <cit>  and in the magic lines. the second set of jea x col- <dig> recombinant lines used was composed of  <dig> rils selected so that they display at least one recombination event over the  <dig> - <dig>  cm interval identified above. phenotyping of the set of  <dig> rils resulted in the mapping of one single locus co-localizing with rpv <dig>  but with a higher effect .fig.  <dig> linkage mapping of the recessive resistance to ppv in an f <dig> jeaxcol- <dig> ril population. the y axis represents the lod score obtained by interval mapping  on the first set of  <dig> rils



it appears here that cvi- <dig> and col- <dig> are sharing the same genomic region. a jea × col-0 f <dig> population was tested for resistance to ppv mechanical inoculation and a majority of the plants  resulted positive. the segregation ratio in f <dig> cvi- <dig> × ler progenies  <cit>  as well as the fact that the jea × col-0 f <dig> population is susceptible indicate that both populations display a recessive resistance to ppv. however, since the interval is still rather large, we cannot rule out, at this stage, an overlapping of two distinct loci. we thus performed the fine mapping of this region which controls resistance to ppv mechanical inoculation and allelism tests.

fine-mapping of the rpv <dig> locus in near isogenic backgrounds
to avoid any epistatic interactions with other loci, the fine mapping of rpv <dig> was performed in near isogenic lines  originating from a cvi- <dig> × ler recombinant inbred line population  <cit> . the procedure was conducted in three steps as described in the material and methods section. the first step allowed us to determine the upper and lower borders of the rpv <dig> locus in cvi- <dig> , as depicted in the nils lcn <dig>  and  <dig> . the identified recombination points were flanked by two markers, f6d <dig> sslp <dig> and f12k <dig> ssr <dig> , and delineated an interval of  <dig>  mb .fig.  <dig> schematic representation of near-isogenic lines  and markers used to fine map rpv <dig> 
Δ markers used to fine map rpv <dig> in near-isogenic lines; *markers used to improved linkage mapping in jea × col- <dig> recombinant inbred lines; r for resistant accession  or near-isogenic lines ; s for susceptible accession  or near-isogenic lines



the second fine-mapping step allowed to reduce the rpv <dig> interval down to 460 kb, between markers t6h <dig> ssr <dig> and f12k <dig> ssr <dig>  the third step consisted in a second run of fine-mapping, this time using a lcn <dig>   × lcn <dig>   f <dig> population of  <dig> individuals. in this case, all lines were screened with the t6h <dig> ssr <dig>  isbp  <dig>  t8l <dig> ssr and f12k <dig> ssr <dig> markers. this allowed narrowing down the rpv <dig> interval to 260 kb, between positions  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> on the long arm of chromosome  <dig> .

the col- <dig> and cvi- <dig> resistances involve the same gene
in order to see if the col- <dig> and cvi- <dig> resistances involve the same gene, we performed an allelism test. col- <dig> was crossed with a resistant near isogenic line carrying the rpv <dig> genomic region of cvi- <dig>  namely lcn <dig>  . the corresponding f <dig> progeny was mechanically challenged with ppv and 100 % of tested plants were observed to be resistant. since partial resistance in col- <dig> and cvi- <dig> is recessive, this allelism test demonstrates that rpv <dig> is allelic in both accessions.

further characterization of the breakdown of the rpv1-mediated resistance upon biolistics or agroinoculation
in order to further characterize the rpv1-mediated resistance and to ensure that it had been properly mapped, ler, cvi- <dig> and ten selected lcn nils  were inoculated in parallel using three techniques: mechanical inoculation, agro-inoculation or biolistics. in each case, the same viral inoculum, derived from ppv-r, was used. mechanical inoculation of the cvi- <dig>  ler and near-isogenic lcn lines provided viral infection ratios similar to those shown in fig.  <dig>  in comparison, when the five ppv-resistant lcn lines  were inoculated either by agroinoculation or by biolistics, 100 % of the plants showed ppv systemic accumulation . fluorescence microscopy observation of mechanically inoculated leaves of ler and of the ppv-resistant lcn lines  revealed clear ppv accumulation, demonstrating that rpv <dig> does not prevent multiplication in inoculated leaves but only affects ppv systemic infection of non-inoculated tissues. however, an effect of rpv <dig> on a reduction in the accumulation rate in inoculated leaves could not be ruled out.fig.  <dig> green fluorescence protein -tagged plum pox virus  behavior into inoculated leaves of ler and a ppv-resistant lcn line . photographs under a uv stereomicroscope of gfp accumulation in ler and lcn  <dig> , inoculated  and systemic tissues  after mechanical inoculation with picppvnkgfp  and inoculated leaf after agro-inoculation with pbinppvnkgfp . white arrows point out inoculation area



cpgk2: a potential candidate for rpv1
studies with the watermelon mosaic virus  – arabidopsis thaliana pathosystem have identified in cvi- <dig> a recessive resistance gene  that maps to the same region as the rpv <dig> locus. using a combination of fine mapping and functional validation, rwm <dig> has recently been shown to correspond to a gene coding for a chloroplast phosphoglycerate kinase   <cit> . given the co-localization of the rwm <dig> and rpv <dig> resistances, the possibility that the same cpgk <dig> might contribute to the resistance to ppv systemic accumulation analyzed here was evaluated. similarly to ouibrahim et al.  <cit> , a trv-based vigs system was used to knock-down cpgk <dig> expression in nicotiana benthamiana and to evaluate its impact on ppv accumulation. the entire experiment was repeated twice and means results between these two experiments are presented in fig.  <dig>  the results obtained show that the levels of the chloroplast pgk <dig> mrna in the pgk- <dig> and pgk-3-inoculated plants were reduced by about 90 % as compared to control plants inoculated with the pds construct. in the same plants, ppv accumulation in systemic, non-inoculated leaves was reduced by over 90 % in pgk-3- and pgk-5-silenced plants. taken together, these results suggest that the chloroplast pgk <dig> is required for efficient ppv accumulation in n. benthamiana.fig.  <dig> effect of the viral-induced silencing of the cpgk <dig> gene on ppv accumulation in nicotiana benthamiana. a,the accumulation levels of cpgk <dig> transcripts and b, ppv rna were measured by quantitative rt-pcr in the non-inoculated leaves at  <dig> dpi. the values represent means  of fold changes relative to the control . each sample includes four to six biological replicates. the rna levels were normalized to that of nbef <dig>  means and standard errors are displayed as vertical bars. the phytoene desaturase  was used as positive control



cpgk <dig> is down-expressed in arabidopsis col- <dig> rosette leaves but not in cvi- <dig> 
while both cvi- <dig> and cvi- <dig> cpgk <dig> genes  display a non-synonymous mutation  <cit> , no allelic difference was identified in col- <dig>  in comparison to ler. we thus hypothesized that resistance to ppv in col- <dig> is linked to a transcriptional regulation of the cpgk <dig> gene. total rna was extracted from col- <dig>  ler and cvi- <dig> rosette leaves at inoculation time and cpgk <dig> expression was tested by quantitative real time reverse transcription pcr  analysis. the expression level of cpgk <dig> was compared to the at2g <dig> arabidopsis reference gene  <cit>  . interestingly, cpgk <dig> in col- <dig> rosette leaves is two-fold downregulated in comparison with ler and up to  <dig> times less expressed in comparison with cvi- <dig> 

discussion
in the present study, we report the identification in arabidopsis of a genomic region associated with partial resistance to ppv systemic accumulation upon mechanical inoculation. in order to fine map this region a combination of linkage mapping in ril and nil populations and of genome wide association mapping were used. each of the bi- and multi-parental linkage mapping experiments detected a major and recurrent locus that had previously been mapped by sicard et al.  <cit>  and named rpv <dig>  allele which determine this resistance trait are present in both the cvi- <dig> and col- <dig> accessions, as well as in can- <dig> and ws as shown in the magic experiment. an allelism test indicated that restriction of ppv infection in the cvi- <dig> and col- <dig> accessions is controlled by the same gene. we also showed that rpv <dig> is distinct from the previously identified sha <dig> locus.

indeed, in a recently published report, the resistance to ppv systemic accumulation following agrobacterium-mediated inoculation has been analyzed in the same set of multiparental recombinant lines, using the same viral isolate   <cit> . this work identified loci controlling ppv systemic accumulation  but not the rpv <dig> locus. this could be linked to the finding that the rpv1-controlled recessive resistance is overcome when ppv is inoculated using either agro-inoculation or biolistics. this phenomenon can be explained either by an over-load of ppv inoculum when using the more efficient agroinoculation or biolistics techniques, or by differences in the biological form of the virus when delivered: an encapsidated virion for mechanical inoculation, purified infectious cdna molecules in the other techniques. alternatively, the use of a more effective inoculation method may result in a higher number of initially infected cells or in a higher viral load in those cells, allowing the virus to overcome the rpv <dig> resistance mechanism. such a scenario has been observed previously for both cauliflower mosaic virus  <cit>  and plantago asiatica mosaic virus  <cit>  but in both cases, the resistance involved was dominant. this result also poses the question of the interest and of the durability of the rpv1-driven resistance mechanism if transferred to prunus hosts.

a recent study in wmv – arabidopsis pathosystem identified rwm <dig>  a recessive resistance gene in cvi- <dig> which co-localizes in the rpv <dig> interval determined here. in cvi- <dig>  rwm <dig> determines recessive resistance to wmv, with incomplete penetrance depending on the wmv isolate   <cit> . this incomplete penetrance is speculated to be an environmental effect, as it is in particular affected by light exposure during inoculation of the plants. in the case of rpv <dig>  the incomplete penetrance can attain a level of 33-35 % of the plants. in the experiments reported here, the different populations were tested at the same period of the year and in the same environmental conditions . in order to differentiate selection of resistance-breaking viral isolate from true, partial resistance, populations of ppv were allowed to evolve for  <dig> consecutive 21-day serial passages in the col- <dig> accession. by the end of this experiment, ppv did not show any increased virulence. thus, rpv <dig> can be considered as a locus controlling partial resistance to ppv infection. the term “partial resistance” and its various interpretations are widely used in plant/pathogen genetics, in particular in describing plant/virus interactions. in most cases it has been associated with quantitative resistance and described as a reduction of disease intensity, or of pathogen accumulation, rather than the absence of disease  <cit> . it can be attributed to a lower viral multiplication or accumulation, with the virus able to infect the host plant systemically but remaining at a lower concentration in plant tissues  <cit> . some authors also used the term partial resistance when viruses are restricted to specific tissues or to specific stages of the host plant development . finally, others describe partial resistance as an absence of symptoms despite a normal viral accumulation in systemic tissues .

in the case of the rpv <dig> resistance, partial resistance to ppv infection in cvi- <dig> and col- <dig> is characterized by the tendency to escape systemic infection upon mechanical inoculation. given the recessive nature of the resistance, this could be explained by a weaker interaction between host factor and viral proteins. among potential candidate genes present in the restricted rwm <dig> interval, ouibrahim et al.  <cit>  discovered a non-synonymous mutation  in the cvi- <dig> and cvi- <dig> cpgk <dig>  they demonstrated, using a trv-based virus induced gene silencing system in n. benthamiana, that wmv accumulation was affected by the reduction of the at1g <dig> cpgk <dig> transcripts. the same approach was used here to demonstrate that cpgk <dig> expression is also necessary for efficient ppv accumulation in n. benthamiana systemic leaves. therefore, a likely hypothesis is that rpv <dig> might be a functional cpgk <dig> gene, in ppv susceptible accessions such as ler. partial resistance in the cvi- <dig> accession can be potentially explained by a weaker interaction between cvi-cpgk <dig> and ppv protein as a result of the identified s78g mutation. however, the col- <dig> cpgk <dig> gene does not display nucleotide variation in comparison with ler and rpv <dig> resistance in col- <dig> might occur at another level, possibly cpgk <dig> reduced expression. since rpv <dig> is controlling a recessive resistance mechanism, susceptibility to the virus is thus dependent on the amount of cpgk <dig> proteins available for full compatible interaction.

in this respect, it is worth noting that in the complete arabidopsis transcriptome data base  the ler cpgk <dig> transcript level was not significantly different between ppv-infected and mock inoculated plants  while babu et al.  <cit>  showed an induction of cpgk <dig> expression in col- <dig> leaf tissues 17 days post ppv inoculation. in our case, we showed a significantly lower expression of cpgk <dig> in col- <dig> in comparison with the susceptible ler accession. in consequence, a limitation of cpgk <dig> transcripts in the inoculated leaves could explain the partial resistance of col- <dig> to ppv infection. however, while our results are in agreement with experiments conducted with wmv  <cit> , we showed here that cpgk <dig> gene silencing affects viral accumulation in n. benthamiana, not the number of plants truly infected.

CONCLUSIONS
most of the studies on recessive resistance published to date describe alleles of genes encoding the translation initiation factors  <cit>  as mediators of virus resistance. the present report describes a ppv recessive resistance mechanism potentially involving a chloroplast phosphoglycerate kinase. the identification of a new ppv resistance mechanism, distinct of the translation initiation complex, is important for developing novel strategies for resistance gene pyramiding in stone fruit crop species. however, deployment of such resistance specific to the inoculation method has to be considered carefully and should be combined with other, more general, resistance mechanisms.
