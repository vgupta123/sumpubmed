BACKGROUND
the plant hormone jasmonic acid  is involved in diverse developmental processes and defense responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. ja affects various stages of plant development including germination, root growth, tendril coiling, fertility, fruit ripening, tuberization, and senescence  <cit> . methyl jasmonate , the volatile form of ja, has been widely used to study jasmonate signaling pathways and mechanisms of plant defense. meja activates a signaling cascade of plant cell membrane genes. following activation, the expression levels of defensive genes, such as proteinase inhibitors and pathogenesis-related  proteins, change in order to regulate plant defense and immune responses  <cit> .

with recent advances in genomic technologies, many jasmonate-responsive genes have been identified including those involved in jasmonate biosynthesis, secondary metabolism, and signal conduction and gene activation pathways  <cit> . meja-mediated signaling pathways and cellular responses can be researched using functional genomics and bioinformatics approaches. most of the earlier studies examining the role of ja or meja in arabidopsis, tomato, and tobacco employed microarray technology  <cit> . studies have shown significant changes in the expression levels of induced genes. these studies have pushed the research toward the functional analysis of ja-response genes; however, due to the limitations of the microarray approach, the direct functions of ja-induced genes are unable to be determined.

the availability of genome sequences of many plant species and high-throughput technologies such as proteomics have facilitated a better understanding of the role of meja and its regulatory networks in plants. these later studies have been conducted in arabidopsis, rice and wheat  <cit> . for example, the expression of ja-induced pr proteins and cellular protectant proteins in rice leaves were shown along with suppression of ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase , and exogenous application of ja induced the expression of several defense and stress-related genes  <cit> . similarly, exogenous meja significantly enhanced disease resistance in wheat and showed significant increase of the expression of pr genes  <cit> .

to date, there is limited research examining the effects of meja on signal pathways and cellular responses in maize. as a global crop, maize quality and yield is affected by environmental conditions and pathogen exposures. previous studies report that exogenous application of meja induced physiological and molecular changes leading to increased resistance to pathogens and other stressors. although these studies provide some insight to meja function in maize, there is a need to examine both the expression of genes and proteins since mrna levels are not always consistent with protein levels due to post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulatory activities. in order to adequately study the molecular basis of meja-induced changes in maize, we examined both gene and protein expressions. recent proteomics studies in maize focus on drought  <cit> , light  <cit> , and temperature stresses  <cit> ; however, meja responses in maize using proteomic approaches have not been reported.

the aim of the present study is to identify proteins and genes induced by meja and to determine how the protein levels are regulated by meja. using proteomics and qrt-pcr technologies, we identified differentially expressed genes and proteins. we present the correlation between differentially expressed proteins and genes induced by meja involved in various cellular functions.

RESULTS
plant proteins under meja treatment
in this study, to determine the best induction conditions of exogenous application of meja, four time points  and four concentrations  were tested. total proteins of each group were analyzed using sds-page and the protein profiles were compared. the mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the proteomexchange consortium  <cit>  via the pride partner repository with the dataset identifier pxd <dig>  the total protein concentration in maize reached the highest concentration at 225 μm of meja for 12 hours .figure  <dig>

the effects of feeding acb larvae and adults with meja-treated maize
to evaluate the effects of meja on different larval stages of ostrinia furnacalis, commonly known as the asian corn borer , we inspected the mortality rate of larvae fed on corn leaves treated with different concentrations of meja. summarized in figure  <dig>  the mortality rates of larvae fed on leaves treated with different concentrations of meja were all higher than the controls. increasing concentrations of meja caused the mortality rate of larvae to increase and reached its highest level at the concentration of 225 μm. there was a decrease in the mortality rate at the concentration of 450 μm. the 3rd stage larvae were significantly affected by meja compared to the other stages of larvae . thus, we concluded that the acb were significantly affected at 225 μm of meja .figure  <dig>

we also assayed the effects of meja on the developmental duration of different larval stages of the acb. with increasing concentrations of meja, the number of days spent in different stages of development increased. although 1st instar larvae were not affected significantly, total duration of other stages of larvae  were significantly delayed by  <dig> and 450 μm of meja . compared to controls, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th instar larvae exposed to 225 μm of meja were developmentally delayed by 24%, 22%, and 75%, respectively. the 5th instar larvae were also significantly delayed at  <dig> and 225 μm of meja  . in summary, the differences between the treated and control groups were significant at 225 μm of meja for 12 hours.table  <dig>

we examined the effects on insect growth and development of acb larvae fed on maize treated with different concentrations of exogenous meja. the growth and development of acb larvae were significantly inhibited with meja. compared to the control group, the weight of larvae treated with  <dig> and 450 μm of meja was significantly decreased by  <dig>  ~  <dig>  mg , and the weight of pupae significantly decreased  by  <dig>  mg . many of the pupae fed by maize leaves treated by 225 μm of meja for 12 hours were abnormal .figure  <dig>

we also evaluated the effects of meja on the life table of acb. compared to the control group, when acb larvae/adults were fed corn leaves treated with 225 μm of meja, the net reproductive decreased  <dig> %, the intrinsic rate of increase decreased  <dig> %, and time to double the population increased  <dig> % .table  <dig>

the proteome profile of maize leaves in response to meja and its functional classification
2-d gels were performed to separate proteins in two dimensions for quantitative analysis and protein identification. quantitative image analysis by the imagemaster™ 2-d platinum  <dig>  revealed significant changes in  <dig> protein spots  with a change greater than  <dig>  fold . of the  <dig> meja-responsive proteins,  <dig> proteins were significantly increased,  <dig> were decreased, and  <dig> were detectable. protein spots from both control and meja group were excised and identified .figure  <dig> 
2-d gel analysis of proteins extracted from maize leaves treated by 225 μm meja for 12 h. a total of 1000 μg of protein was loaded on each ipg strip . protein spots were visualized using coomassie brilliant blue staining. protein spots from both meja treatment  and control group  were identified.



the identified proteins further were classified based on their subcellular localization and biological process according to annotations in the swiss-prot database. all of the identified proteins were classified into  <dig> functional groups, covering a wide range of pathways and functions: photosynthesis , energy , protein folding, degradation, modification , stress and defense , redox-regulation , transcription related protein , metabolism , protein synthesis , secondary metabolism , and cell structure . we also found some unknown proteins . the four largest groups of proteins, consisting of  <dig> proteins, were associated with photosynthesis, energy, protein folding and defense-related proteins, which indicated that multiple cellular processes are important for plant defense responses triggered by meja .figure  <dig>

five heat shock-related proteins/chaperones were responsive to the meja treatment. seven spots  were increased in the presence of meja. spots  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were identified to be beta-d-glucosidase precursor. spots  <dig> and  <dig> were identified to be glutathione transferases   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the pathogenesis-related protein  <dig> was also found to respond to meja in this study. we found increases in two superoxide dismutase , sod   <dig>  and sod   <dig>   <dig>  mitochondrial precursor . we identified gdp-mannose  <dig>  5-epimerase. spot  <dig> was identified as dehydroascorbatereductase  and increased after meja treatment. four proteins involved in plant metabolism  were increased by meja treatment. spots  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> play major roles in detoxification in plant secondary metabolism. spot  <dig>  identified as aldo-ketoreductase family  <dig>  member b <dig>  has frequently been implicated in the metabolism of exogenous and endogenous toxicants, including those stimulated by stresses  <cit> . spot  <dig>  identified as inorganic pyrophosphatase, was increased after meja treatment. meja treatment induced the differential expression of four translation-related spots  in leaves. spot  <dig> was identified as plasminogen activator inhibitor  <dig> rna-binding protein and increased by meja treatment. spots  <dig> and  <dig> were decreased and identified as nucleic acid binding protein  <dig> and ribonucleoprotein, respectively. spot  <dig> was identified as hypothetical protein loc <dig>  containing an agglutinin domain and increased in response to meja treatment .

quantitative rt-pcr analysis of four defense genes
four genes closely associated with plant defense were selected for qrt-pcr analysis: beta-d-glucosidase precursor gene ; thioredoxin m-type, chloroplastic precursor gene ; pathogenesis-related protein  <dig> gene ; and glycine-rich rna-binding, abscisic acid-inducible protein gene . the primers of these four genes and the reference gene  are listed in table  <dig>  the qrt-pcr results are shown in figure  <dig>  the primers were designed using primer premier  <dig> . the suitable restriction enzymes were added when we designed the primers for in-fusion defensive proteins. following meja treatment, there was more than  <dig>  fold increase in the expression levels of these four genes. the bgl , pr <dig> , and rab <dig>  genes were up-regulated while trxm  was down-regulated after meja induction.table  <dig>

cloning and expression of four fusion proteins and evaluation of their effects on acb
genes trxm, rab <dig>  pr <dig>  and bgl were cloned and the pcr products were subjected to 1% agarose electrophoresis shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  the positive clones were screened by enzyme digestion and pcr amplification . the induced proteins and the control were loaded on a 5% sds-page, and three fusion proteins were successfully expressed . the concentrations of the purified proteins pr <dig>  trxm, and rab <dig> were tested as  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  mg/ml by bradford assay. we fed acb with the same concentration of purified protein. compared to ddh2o and pet-28a empty vector groups, fusion proteins of trxm and pr <dig> significantly delayed the growth and development of acb, and the inhibition rates were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the fusion protein of rab <dig> did not affect the weight of larvae but significantly affected the weight of the acb pupae .figure  <dig>

comparative analysis of transcriptome data and proteome data
comparing proteome data with the transcriptome data, we identified  <dig> genes out of the  <dig> genes that were matched to  <dig> proteins by identity or high homology . when the relative protein expression levels were compared with mrna levels,  <dig> displayed similar expression trends, and  <dig> showed opposite trends of expression. for example, spot  <dig>  showed decreased protein level after induction by meja, while qrt-pcr showed increased level of mrna expression. for those that followed similar up or down expression trends at the mrna and protein levels, they differed in fold change at the two levels.

a hypothetical model of meja response in maize
in figure  <dig>  we offer a possible pathway that describes how meja may induce responsive proteins with insect defense capabilities. in the hypothetical model, tab <dig> is viewed as central to aba and ja signaling, and it transfers the signal to receptors to induce the expression of ja responsive defense genes for pr1- or trxm-mediated resistant reactions. bgl protein also may involve this ja responsive defense. thus, maize could perceive the meja signal to regulate transcription, protein synthesis, and related bioprocesses, thereby affecting the levels of functional proteins to defend against pathogens such as acb. these processes work cooperatively to establish a defensive state in maize plants under attack by pathogenic herbivores.figure  <dig>

discussion
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
while 2-d gels provide information about protein quantity, charge, and mass of an intact protein, the method has limitations when analyzing of multiple proteins present in a single spot. specifically, the change of the spot intensity caused by experimental treatment usually cannot be assigned to a particular protein  <cit> . in our study, spot  <dig> showed a significant  <dig> -fold increase after meja treatment. the two proteins identified in this spot were glutathione transferase iii  and the hypothetical protein loc <dig> containing a proteasome subunit alpha domain . since the 2-d gel method has an advantage in distinguishing proteins of closely related family members and proteins with different modifications leading to changes in pi and molecular weight, the pattern of these protein spots on the gel may indicate possible genetic isoforms and/or post-translational modifications ptms. the possible existence of different protein isoforms is worthy of further investigation.

under herbivore attack, secondary metabolites such as phenolic acids, tannins, and alkaloids are produced to induce and enhance plant defense. in addition to secondary metabolites, the plant defense response is mediated by defense proteins  <cit> . the proteins induced by exogenous meja are considered to be an important “defense weapon” in plants. for example, plant protease inhibitors  induced by wounding bind protease enzymes in the insect, thereby decreasing or inhibiting protein digestion activities in the gut. the expression of pis is regulated by a ja pathway  <cit> . the expression of the ja-inducible proteins , threonine deaminase enzyme and arginase, enhance plant tolerance to herbivores  <cit> . the plant response to exogenous meja includes massive changes in physiology and biochemistry. the proteins involved in ja synthesis, regulation of cell wall structures, stress and defense responses, and photosynthesis are all induced by meja  <cit> . in this study, we have provided additional candidates for the meja-responsive proteome.

some important proteins in plant defense reactions
protein folding, degradation, modification-related proteins
heat-shock proteins /chaperones are responsible for protein folding, assembly, translocation, and degradation in normal cellular processes. they stabilize proteins and membranes, and assist in biotic and abiotic stress tolerance by protein refolding  <cit> . thus, the ubiquitous hsps/chaperone system plays pivotal roles in cells under normal and stressful conditions  <cit> . here we identified five heat shock-related proteins/chaperones in maize response to the meja treatment that also increased in abundance after meja treatment . as low-molecular-mass hsps, small hsps  form a widespread and more diverse family than other hsps/chaperones with respect to sequence similarity, cellular location and functions  <cit> . the increased abundance of shsps/chaperones after meja treatment suggests that hsps are synthesized in plant cells in response to biotic stresses. in addition, s-phase kinase-associated-protein  <dig> , was shown to be a component of a scf  complex which is necessary for ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation in eukaryotes  <cit> . in arabidopsis, many f-box proteins are found to interact with ask <dig> or ask <dig>  which suggests that they could form various scf complexes, and that scf complexes may regulate plant development by affecting the signal pathways of auxin, gibberellin, and ethylene  <cit> . in our study, the skp1-like protein 1a increased in response to meja treatment in maize  which indicates that this protein may mediate the meja signaling pathway to enhance plant defense responses  <cit> .

defense and stress-related proteins
plant responses to abiotic and biotic stresses involve the expression of a large number of proteins, many of which are believed to be crucial components of the plant’s self-defense mechanism. in this study, seven spots  increased in the presence of meja. spots  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were identified to be a beta-d-glucosidase precursor. beta-glucosidases play significant roles in diverse aspects of plant physiology and activate chemical defense compounds that function as a chemical deterrent to herbivore and pathogen attack  <cit> . in some cases, a functional diversification of glutathione transferases  has roles in isomerization, reduction, and the binding, protection, and transport of secondary products  <cit> . in this study, spots  <dig> and  <dig> were identified to be gsts  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. plant gsts have been associated with responses to biotic and abiotic stress, hormones and developmental changes. our results suggest that gsts mediate plant defense through direct and indirect methods. we also detected the pathogenesis-related protein  <dig> as responsive to meja. this response has been observed previously in arabidopsis, rice, and tobacco with exogenous application of ja  <cit> .

redox-related proteins
to reduce oxidative injuries induced from reactive oxygen species , plants have developed enzymatic systems for scavenging ros  <cit> . superoxide dismutase  catalyzes the conversion of the toxic o2− radial to oxygen  and h2o <dig>  catalase, peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase  can convert ros such as h2o <dig> to water and o <dig>  ros work together as enzymatic antioxidant defense systems in yeasts, animals, and plants. we found an increase of two sods . they were sod   <dig>  and sod   <dig> , mitochondrial precursor . initially discovered as regulators of light-dependent malate biosynthesis in the chloroplast  <cit> , plant thioredoxins are involved in a large panel of reactions related to metabolism, defense, and development  <cit> .

we also identified gdp-mannose  <dig> -epimerase. this enzyme catalyzes a reversible epimerization of gdp-d-mannose that precedes the committed step in the biosynthesis of vitamin c, an enzyme cofactor and an antioxidant  <cit> . it plays a crucial role in response to induction by meja in many essential physiological processes such as biosynthesis of the cell wall, phytohormones, secondary metabolites, cell division, growth, stress resistance, and photoprotection in plants  <cit> . spot  <dig> was identified as dehydroascorbatereductase  and increased after meja treatment. expression of dhar responsible for regenerating ascorbic acid from an oxidized state regulates the cellular redox state, which in turn affects cell response and tolerance to environmental ros. ascorbate is essential for the detoxification of environmental toxins and products of oxidative stress  <cit> .

metabolism-related proteins
in zea mays, four proteins involved in plant metabolism  were increased by meja treatment . spots  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> play major roles in detoxification in plant secondary metabolism. spot  <dig>  identified as aldo-ketoreductase family  <dig>  member b <dig>  has frequently been implicated in the metabolism of exogenous and endogenous toxicants, including those stimulated by stresses  <cit> . spot  <dig>  identified as inorganic pyrophosphatase, increased after meja treatment. pyrophosphoric acid in plant tissues is mainly produced in the biosynthesis of rna, protein, carbohydrates, etc. accumulation of pyrophosphoric acid can inhibit normal biosynthesis and affect plant growth. in plant cells, inorganic pyrophosphatase can decompose pyrophosphoric acid into inorganic pyrophosphate to detoxify and enable plant growth. on the other hand, some related studies showed that the protein coding genes were induced by aba suggesting aba signal conduction  <cit> . we deduce that the inorganic pyrophosphatase may be induced by meja treatment, and through the meja signal pathway, regulate its related gene expression.

compared with other studies that many metabolites such as carbohydrates, lipids, protein metabolite related proteins, and secondary metabolism, related proteins induced by meja, we only identified a few proteins related to metabolism. this may be closely related to the treatment time and concentration of meja.

rna-binding proteins  play key roles in post-transcriptional control of rnas, which along with transcriptional regulation, are an important way to regulate patterns of gene expression during development  <cit> . nucleic acid-binding protein  belongs to a family of nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins, which share a common domain structure and are thought to be involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of chloroplast gene expression  <cit> . post-transcriptional regulation can occur at many different steps in rna metabolism, including splicing, polyadenylation, mrna stability, mrna localization and translation. our results suggest that ja treatment can regulate transcription and post-transcription of rnas. most importantly, we identified a glycine-rich, rna-binding, aba-inducible protein with decreased abundance in response to meja. this family of proteins is involved in the regulation of post-transcriptional gene expression processes including pre-mrna splicing, mrna transport, mrna stability and translation  <cit> . it has been reported that the glycine-rich, rna-binding, aba-inducible protein  <dig> expression is modulated via a circadian clock and by a variety of abiotic and biotic stress conditions  <cit> . recently, this protein was shown to affect stomata movement in response to abiotic stress, and thus, played a role in freezing tolerance and response to dehydration under high salinity stress  <cit> . the glycine-rich, rna-binding, abscisic acid-inducible protein has 82% positive homology with a protein from rice associated with disease resistance  <cit> . except for complex light harvesting, proteins, microarray studies did not identify significant expression changes in genes of the other proteins, highlighting the importance of proteomic studies. interestingly, microarray analysis showed that meja treatment led to remarkably decreased transcripts of aba-responsive genes, indicating that an antagonistic interaction occurs between the ja and aba signaling pathways in abiotic stress responses  <cit> .

cell structure
spot  <dig>  which increased response to meja treatment, was identified as the hypothetical protein loc <dig> containing an agglutinin domain. it is involved in the regulation of gene expression in stressed plants through specific protein-carbohydrate interactions with regulatory cytoplasmic/nuclear glycoproteins. many flowering plants contain sequences encoding putative homologues of the tobacco lectin-ja inducible proteins , which imply a possible ubiquitous family of lectins with a specific endogenous role  <cit> . however, there is no report regarding the function of loc <dig> and whether it belongs to jips. it is possible that further analysis of this protein may enhance our understanding of jips.

in this study, we confirmed the presence of known meja responsive proteins, such as gsts, pathogenesis-related protein  <dig>  thioredoxin m-type , and a beta-d-glucosidase precursor in addition to identifying new stress and defense related proteins such as chaperone protein clpb  <dig>  putative, expressed and putative small heat shock protein, 5′-partial and so forth. the proteins play different specific biological functions, e.g., some play major roles in plant response to stresses. at present, information about these protein functions is not complete, but their expression changes after meja induction will provide valuable references for us to elucidate the induced defense mechanisms.

comparative analysis of transcriptome data and proteome data
the only available transcriptomics analysis of leaves treated by meja was carried out using microarrays in a. thaliana and in rice. although  <dig> jasmonate-responsive genes were differentially expressed in a. thaliana  <cit> , the study did not thoroughly identify the gene functions in the ja or meja signaling pathways.

we also found that changes of beta-d-glucosidase precursor gene and pathogenesis-related protein  <dig> gene were similar at the transcriptional level and the protein level. thioredoxin m-type, chloro-plastic precursor, and glycine-rich rna-binding, abscisic acid-inducible protein exhibited the most drastic changes at the protein level, but their expression levels were not similar to their protein abundances. the mrna levels are not always consistent with protein levels because of various post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels regulatory mechanisms  <cit> .

it should also be noted that the molecular weight of fusion proteins was much higher than predicted and may be attributed to the expression vector. some studies have shown that the his-tag strong electric charge may influence many other his-tag fusion proteins to form higher apparent molecular weight in sds-page  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we applied a 2-d gel approach to identify the proteome changes in maize in response to meja treatment. proteomics analyses identified several proteins involved in stress and defense responses. these proteins may serve important roles in meja signal transduction by ms/ms mapping. further analysis by qrt-pcr showed that the mrna transcription levels did not necessarily correlate with the abundance of their corresponding proteins and highlights the importance of conducting both proteomics and transcriptome analyses.
