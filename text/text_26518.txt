BACKGROUND
the first sequence of bacterial chromosome was published more than  <dig> years ago. now, hundreds of bacterial genomes are available for comparative genomics. the vast genetic information as well as introduction of new bacterial strains to industrial usage require the suitable tools for rapid genetic manipulations with a wide variety of bacterial species. broad-host-range plasmids provide a valuable tool for such work. numerous broad-host-range shuttle vectors, promoter-probe vectors, expression vectors and other special-purpose vectors are available now. the majority of them are based on the replicons of the incq or incp groups .

undoubtedly, rsf <dig> can be considered as the most studied plasmid of this type. rsf <dig> is a mobilizable, non-conjugative, incq group plasmid that has broad host range replication properties in most of the gram- bacteria  <cit>  and at least some of the gram+ species  <cit> . rsf <dig> can use many different transfer systems for its mobilization. this property enables it to be transferred to a wide variety of bacterial hosts and even to plants  <cit> . the nucleotide sequence of this plasmid has been determined  <cit>  and the detailed functional study of all plasmid loci involved in replication and mobilization has been performed . relatively small size , moderate copy-number , capability to replicate and stable maintenance in a broad range of bacterial hosts where rsf <dig> could be easily transferred from the standard laboratory e. coli strains by conjugative mobilization, have made this plasmid an attractive molecular cloning vector for basic research.

on the other hand, rsf <dig> was traditionally used in biotechnology. it is very suitable vector for gene amplification in bacterial producing strains because of its high stability in different hosts. moreover, in e. coli it is compatible with other popular replicons such as pbr <dig>  psc <dig>  etc. due to this property, rsf <dig> was used as a second and even third plasmid vector in the real industrial strains producing different metabolites. however, industrial usage of mobilizable plasmids is undesirable because of biosafety considerations and is restricted today by legislations of several leading countries described, for example, in "guidelines for research involving recombinant dna molecules" published by the nih on the 7th of may,  <dig> and in the european council directives 90/220/eec, 98/81/ec and 90/219/eec. that is why construction of the stably maintained mob- derivative of rsf <dig>  in mob locus, which decreases mobilization frequency significantly) could have important practical application. the modern advanced methods of bacterial transformation, especially the electro transformation technique, provide a simple way for introduction of plasmid dna to a broad range of bacterial hosts, which is not dependent on conjugation and mobilization . thus, in principle, mob- derivatives of rsf <dig> could be used not only in e. coli, but also in other bacterial hosts supporting rsf <dig> replication for that methods of chemical or electro transformation have been elaborated.

previously, several mutations of rsf <dig> have been selected and characterized that significantly decreased efficiency of the plasmid mobilization in the standard laboratory tests  <cit> . but these mutations inactivate only few from the total set of genetic loci of rsf <dig> that participate in mobilization process, and so, from the formal point of view the corresponding plasmids could not be considered as non-mobilizable for non-restricted practical application in the industrial biotechnology. all known genetic loci involved in mobilization have to be eliminated from the officially safe rsf1010-derivatives.

at present, the following loci involved in the plasmid vegetative replication and its mobilization, have been identified in rsf <dig>  <cit>  :

1) transcription of all corresponding genes is initiated from the promoters  . it is under multiple regulatory controls, and the individual plasmid-encoded proteins are involved, as a rule, in several functions essential for plasmid replication, mobilization and regulation of transcription. p <dig> and p <dig> controlled by mobc and moba provide transcription of moba/repb, mobb, and, probably, -operon. the p2-promoter is under the same auto-regulated control and provides transcription of mobc in the opposite direction. the p <dig> promoter providing transcription of -operon, is under the auto-regulated control of the f-repressor, whose gene is located in the same operon  <cit> . earlier it was shown  <cit>  that deletion of the p <dig> promoter does not lead to the loss of the plasmid "availability": transcription of repb  – -operon from the p1/p <dig> promoters is sufficient for the plasmid replication;

2) oriv – the unique origin of vegetative dna replication;

3) repa, repb , and repc – the genes for essential replication proteins. hereat, repa and repc encode a helicase and an oriv binding protein, correspondingly, and the expression level of repc, in particular, regulates the extent of plasmid replication. the product of moba/repb – repb is a multifunctional protein where its c-terminal domain, repb', exhibits dna primase activity in the process of vegetative plasmid replication, whereas its n-terminal part, moba, is essential for the plasmid mobilization, and as well as mobc, plays a role in transcription regulation of the plasmid genes;

4) orit – the site of relaxation complex and origin of conjugative dna transfer;

activities of moba, mobb and mobc providing the specific cleavage of plasmid dna in orit followed by mobilizable transfer, are essential for mobilization of rsf <dig>  mobc encoded by mobc, in cooperation with moba are co-regulators of of plasmid gene transcription, participating, in particular, in auto-regulation of their own synthesis. the mobb gene encoding mobb, is located in the structural part of moba/repb, but translation of the corresponding proteins is occurred in the different reading frames.

the auto-regulated expression of rsf <dig> genes referred to above provides the control of plasmid copy number, its stable maintenance, vegetative replication and mobilization. the corresponding genetic elements are partially overlapped in a rather complicated fashion. all recently obtained rsf1010-based plasmids with partially deleted mob-genes possessed mobilization frequencies detectable even under laboratory conditions. besides, most of the mutant plasmids had significantly increased copy number  <cit> .

for construction of rsf <dig> derivatives that could be officially considered as mob-, we have decided to substitute the plasmid fragment comprising mobc, orit  and 5'-terminal portion of moba/repb encoding mobb and moba, by an artificial dna fragment that could provide efficient transcription and translation of repb. the earlier described  <cit>  genetic element, placuv5→laci linked to sub-optimal sd sequence gggggg has been used initially for reproducing the auto-regulated expression pattern of the native moba/repb gene.

RESULTS
construction of the rsfmob plasmid
as unique endonuclease restriction sites were absent in the target loci of rsf <dig>  we decided to apply a previously developed technique for plasmid gene replacement provided by red-recombination system of phage λ  <cit> . such an approach is extensively exploited for obtaining bacterial artificial chromosome rearrangements  <cit> , but it is not routinely used for in vivo construction of multicopy recombinant plasmids.

λred-mediated substitution of rsf <dig> mob locus by an in vitro generated dna fragment containing an auto-regulated element placuv5→laci marked by chloramphenicol resistance gene  and the flanks strictly homologous to the target sites on the plasmid, was performed  and described in detail in methods. e. coli k <dig> mg <dig> bearing pkd <dig> helper plasmid  <cit>  was used as a recipient strain for λred-mediated integration of the constructed fragment to rsf <dig> 

initially, we transformed the mg1655/pkd <dig> strain with rsf <dig>  the resultant bi-plasmid strain grown in arabinose-containing medium for induction of λred genes was electroporated with the constructed dna fragment. plasmids were isolated from the cmr-clones and re-transformed into e. coli tg <dig> strain. according to restriction analysis, all plasmids from re-transformants had unexpected structure. their patterns showed the presence of the integrated cat-placuv5→laci fragment, but the rest part of the plasmid contained a dna fragment corresponding to rsf <dig> plasmid of the wild-type and some additional dna fragments probably flanking the integrative cassette. formation of the recombinant plasmids joined in tandem to nonrecombinant plasmids in the analogous experiment with pbr <dig> derivatives was described previously  <cit> . in e. coli cells, rsf <dig> replicates by a strand displacement mechanism  <cit>  and has about  <dig> copies  <cit> . as only one of them participates in recombination with the transformed dna fragment, we propose that the selected plasmids could be the products of recombination  between the desirable integrant and the wild-type copies of rsf <dig> 

to avoid the possible undesirable secondary recombination events, we have modified the procedure by introducing the integrative dna fragment to the cells simultaneously with rsf <dig>  to that, mg1655/pkd <dig> strain was electroporated with the mixture of the dna fragment to be integrated and the rsf <dig> plasmid dna . plasmid dna isolated from the cmr clone grown after the electroporation, was re-transformed to e. coli tg <dig>  the obtained cmr transformant contained the expected plasmid named rsfmobcat .

to remove the cat gene, the isolated rsfmobcat plasmid was digested with bglii and xbai followed by ligation of the largest fragment  with bglii-xbai fragment of the placuv <dig> promoter. the later fragment was generated after hydrolysis by the mentioned endonucleases of the dna amplified in polymerase chain reaction with the primers p <dig> and p <dig> and the plasmid pmw-placuv5-laci- <dig>  <cit>  as a template. the resulting plasmid was designated rsfmob .

mobilization frequency of the rsfmob plasmid
the mobilization efficiency of rsfmob as compared to the parental rsf <dig> was tested. for this purpose, donor strains were constructed on the basis of e. coli c <dig>  transformed with the rp <dig>    <cit> . this plasmid carried the tra-operon necessary for conjugal transfer. rsf <dig> and rsfmob were transformed into c <dig>  using strab as a selective marker. the constructed strains were used as the donors in conjugation experiments with the recipient strain mg <dig> to determine the mobilization efficiency. the experiment showed that rsfmob had an undetectable level of mobilization frequency  that was at the minimum  <dig> orders of magnitude lower than for mobilizable rsf <dig> . the described earlier <cit>  Δ <dig>  Δ <dig> and Δ <dig> mutations in the mob locus of rsf <dig> decreased its mobilization frequency up to  <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  respectively.

evaluation of plasmid copy number
rough evaluation by electrophoresis of purified dna  showed that rsfmob had approximately the same copy-number as rsf <dig> in the stationary growth phase . during logarithmic growth, the copy-number of the obtained derivative was about two times lower than that of rsf <dig>  these data were in direct correlation with the levels of streptomycin resistance of the corresponding plasmid strains. addition of  <dig> mm iptg to the medium caused a  <dig> -fold increase of rsfmob copy-number at the logarithmic stage of cell growing . it was proposed that elimination of the laci gene from the rsfmob could increase the plasmid copy-number due to derepression of repb and/or repac transcription  <cit> .

copy number of rsf <dig> plasmid was taken as  <dig> . streptomycin resistance of the plasmid strains was determined on lb agar plates containing different concentrations of the antibiotic in  <dig> hours incubation at +37°c.

the derivative of rsfmob lacking the laci gene was constructed due to the cleavage of the plasmid dna isolated from mg1655dam-  by xbai and bamhi followed by blunt-ending and circularization of the largest dna fragment by t <dig> ligase. the constructed plasmid was designated rsfmob-i . indeed, the copy-number of rsfmob-i was 3-fold higher than for rsfmob . interestingly, the same increase in plasmid copy number had been observed previously for rsf1010-derivatives with inactivated moba or mobc encoding the negative regulators of p1/p <dig> and p <dig> promoters  <cit> .

stability of rsfmob-like plasmids in escherichia coli and pantoea ananatis
for testing the stability of the new plasmids in e. coli, seven 12-hour passages in lb medium of the e. coli mg <dig> strain carrying rsfmob, rsfmob-i or rsf <dig> were performed. each culture grown under the non-selective conditions was plated on lb-agar followed by replica plating of  <dig> clones of each strain on the same medium with or without addition of streptomycin. strs-clones were not detected among the tested ones. thus, the frequency of plasmid loss was less than 1% after seven passages  under non-selective conditions in lb medium for the both obtained plasmids rsfmob and rsfmob-i, as well as for rsf <dig> 

moreover, we have tested replication of rsfmob in pantoea ananatis. biotechnological companies are intensively investigating now this bacterium belonging to enterobacteriaceae as a candidate host for industrial production of different useful metabolites . our previous experiments showed that rsf <dig> is stably maintained in this organism . we introduced rsf <dig> and rsfmob to p. ananatis sc <dig> strain by electroporation method . electroporation frequency was the same  for the both plasmid probes isolated from e. coli tg <dig> strain. for the both plasmids, the frequency of plasmid loss was less than 1% after four 12-hour passages  under non-selective conditions in lb medium. therefore, rsfmob can replicate not only in e. coli, but also in p. ananatis and, probably, in other species related to e. coli.

as for the unrelated species, we have checked replication ability of rsfmob-i in methylophilus methylotrophus. this obligate methylotroph is an interesting object of biotechnology  <cit> . electroporation of rsfmob-i to m. methylotrophus as <dig> strain  was performed as in  <cit> ; rsf <dig> was used as positive control in this experiment. smr clones were selected in the both cases, but isolation of plasmid dna from them performed according to  <cit>  has revealed presence of the plasmid only in the clones obtained after transformation with rsf <dig>  therefore, rsfmob-i is unable to autonomous replication in m. methylotrophus. it was previously shown that the repb' protein can substitute moba to provide rsf <dig> replication in vitro and in vivo in e. coli  <cit> . moreover, co-expression of the repb', repa and repc genes provided in trans replication of the mini-plasmid carrying orivrsf <dig> in pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> . the constructed mob- derivatives of rsf <dig> carry the coding parts of all three genes necessary for replication. therefore, the most probable reason of the observed loss of replication ability in m. methylotrophus is insufficient expression of repb' resulting from low strength of the placuv <dig> promoter in this bacterium. to solve this problem, placuv <dig> or entire placuv5→laci element can be easily substituted by any convenient regulatory region recognized in the concrete bacterial host using unique bglii, xbai and bamhi recognition sites specially introduced in the obtained plasmids. novel mob- derivatives of rsf <dig> differing in copy number or host range can be easily generated from rsfmob in this way.

CONCLUSIONS
although the genetic loci responsible for the vegetative plasmid replication and mobilization are partially overlapped in the native structure of the well-studied broad-host-range plasmid rsf <dig>  we could obtain the new derivatives lacking all sequences participating in mobilization. these new plasmids do not only possess significantly decreased efficiency of mobilization  in the standard laboratory tests, but could be considered as non-mobilizable according to the formal requirements of the plasmids that could be used in the applied biotechnology.

the modified procedure of red-driven recombination was exploited to provide the rather complicated substitution of the constructed in vitro artificial dna fragment for the locus of the moderate copy number plasmid to be deleted. such kind of the so-called recombineering experiments is widely used now for construction/modification of bacterial native/artificial chromosomes, but is not so popular for manipulation with high or moderate copy number plasmids.

initially, the artificial auto-regulated genetic element, placuv5→laci, was used to provide transcription of the genes responsible for vegetative replication of the plasmid. this element substituted the p1/p <dig> native promoters of rsf <dig> that transcribe, in particular, the gene of their own repressor moba  <cit> . this regulation is one of the factors controlling the copy number of the native rsf <dig> plasmid. exploiting of the artificial regulatory element for the same auto-regulation leads to stable maintaining of the new plasmid  and save the plasmid copy number at the level of approximately two times lower, in comparison with rsf <dig>  at the logarithmic stage of growth, and practically the same level, as for rsf <dig>  in the stationary phase. moreover, the copy number could be increased for the new rsfmob plasmid due to addition of iptg in the culture medium. this dependence of the plasmid copy number on the presence of iptg in the culture medium could be useful for exploiting of the new plasmid as the vector in the experiments on optimization of the cloned gene expression. meanwhile, elimination of the laci gene from rsfmob has led to construction of the new plasmid, rsfmob-i, that is stably maintained in e. coli, as well, and its copy number is 3-fold increased, in comparison with rsfmob. rsfmob contains specially introduced unique endonuclease recognition sites, which allow easy substitution of placuv5→laci element by any desirable promoter or regulatory element for the possible changing of plasmid copy number and/or host range according to the aims of future experiments.

as for real exploiting of rsfmob-based recombinant plasmids in industrial strains, the set of further modifications have been provided recently in our laboratory that have been devoted to introducing of thya as the selective marker instead of genes of antibiotic resistance   <cit> .
