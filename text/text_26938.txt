BACKGROUND
cisplatin  is an effective antitumor agent widely used for the treatment of different tumor types  <cit> . in spite of the efficacy, the curative potential of such an antitumor drug is limited by the occurrence of resistance  <cit> . most information about genetic alterations and cellular mechanisms contributing to drug response/resistance comes from mammalian cell systems  <cit> . several mechanisms of resistance to cisplatin have been described including reduced drug accumulation, enhanced repair and increased expression of defence factors  <cit> . some lines of evidence support the concept that altered expression of subsets of genes may be important in determining the sensitivity/resistance to antitumor agents including cisplatin  <cit> . given the powerful molecular tools now available, the combination of molecular pharmacology and molecular biology approaches in studying model organisms could lead to a rapid progress in the discovery of strategies to overcome drug resistance. the ease by which yeast can be manipulated together with similarities of yeast cells to cells of more complex metazoans makes many yeast species,  very attractive models for the investigation of conserved evolutionary processes occurring in eukaryotes  <cit> . using dna microarrays, we previously found that in fission yeast cisplatin activates a stress response involving various gene groups  <cit> . in particular, among the transcripts up-regulated by cisplatin in the sensitive strain, several genes belonging to the ubiquitin -proteasome pathway were identified  <cit> .

the ub-proteasome pathway is implicated in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions and plays a major role in stress response. in fact, by degrading misfolded and damaged proteins, the pathway controls processes including cell cycle, cell death and dna repair  <cit> . the proteasome recognizes ubiquitinated substrates through its ub receptors and digest them into peptides and free ubs. the pathway includes ub activating enzymes , ub conjugating enzymes  and ub ligases , all acting in concert to tag substrates with ub chains. proteins may be monoubiquitinated or the ub monomer may act as a point of attachment for additional ub monomers, resulting in polyubiquitination. the specific biological signal mediated by a polyubiquitin chain is determined, in part, by the chain topology, which is assigned by the ub lysine residue used for chain extension. lys48-linked chains have been implicated in targeting proteins for proteasomal degradation, whereas lys63-linked chains seem to regulate proteins involved in a wide range of processes, including dna repair, mrna translation and endocytosis. indeed, the ub-proteasome system is known to regulate the transcription of many genes via both proteolytic and non-proteolytic activities  <cit> . ub modification of proteins is reversible as ub may be removed from proteins by de-ubiquitinating enzymes which hydrolyze the isopeptide bond between ub and the substrate proteins, or by ub proteases which remove ub monomers from a polyubiquitin chain.

since conclusive findings about the specific contribution of different pathways to cisplatin response in fission yeast have been limited by the analysis of small sets of mutants, in the present study we used a large panel of strains to clarify the contribution of single proteasome genes to cisplatin response. in particular, we employed non-essential haploid deletion mutants, belonging to a collection of haploid strains - constructed through homologous recombination in s. pombe  <cit>  - to examine sensitivity to cisplatin. here, we describe our results aimed at clarifying the involvement of specific genes modulated by cisplatin treatment in cell response to the drug. understanding the relevant genetic/biochemical alterations of the cisplatin response pathway may provide a rational basis for improving therapy in resistant tumors.

RESULTS
experimental model
a set of mutants from a genome-wide library containing  <dig> haploid strains was used in the present study. the library represents around 70% of non-essential s. pombe genes  and around 2% of them belong to the ub-proteasome pathway . using terms from the gene ontology  consortium, each mutant can be assigned at least to one go annotation . the go project - the gene ontology http://geneontology.org - is a major collaborative bioinformatics initiative that aims at standardizing the representation of gene and gene product attributes across species. fission yeast has at least one go annotation for  <dig> % of its known and predicted protein coding genes , greater than the current percentage coverage for any other organism  <cit> . the go terms that are most enriched for ub-proteasome genes are reported in table  <dig>  they represent approximately 3% of gene products annotated to "biological processes" for fission yeast. see additional file 2: figure s <dig> and additional file 3: figure s <dig>  for tree views from go.

the screening of the library was performed in liquid culture assays, because this test is more suitable than tests on plates to examine the effect of cisplatin, which by virtue of its chemical features  easily reacts with the abundant nucleophilic components of yeast extract plates , thereby becoming inactive. in preliminary experiments, the optimal drug concentrations to employ in the deletion mutant screening were determined using the wild-type  <dig> h- and mutant rad <dig> strain because rad <dig> is hypersensitive to cisplatin  and  <dig> h- is the strain from which rad <dig> mutant was generated.

sensitivity of s. pombe deletion mutants to cisplatin
when assaying the cisplatin sensitivity of  <dig> deletion mutants belonging to the proteasome pathway, we identified a number of cisplatin sensitive and resistant mutants in comparison to the corresponding wild-type strains . a list of the s. cerevisiae and human homologous/horthologous genes corresponding to those evaluated for cisplatin sensitivity is reported in table  <dig>  in particular, we found that  <dig> deletion mutants were cisplatin-sensitive  and that  <dig> mutants were cisplatin-resistant .

a sensitivity was evaluated using a microtiter growth inhibition assay with a  <dig> h drug exposure. ic <dig> values are the means Â± standard deviation of at least three independent experiments. the ic <dig> was defined as the drug concentration that reduced the absorbance to 50% of the value measured for the untreated control culture, and was compared to cisplatin sensitivity of the corresponding wild-type parental strain. hypersensitive strains are indicated as hs and resistant strains as r.

cisplatin-sensitive deletion mutants
ubp <dig> , similar to s. cerevisiae ubp <dig> , is a ub-specific processing protease endowed with ub-c-terminal hydrolase activity, and is localized to the nucleolus of s. pombe. the corresponding budding yeast homolog gene ubp <dig> encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme whose loss of function results in a complex phenotype displaying perturbations in different cellular processes, characterized by slow growth rate, partial impairment of silencing at telomeres, reduced subtelomeric repression and up-regulation of stress-responsive genes. this complex phenotype is also accompanied by accumulation of reactive oxygen species and by appearance of apoptosis-like phenotypical markers  <cit> . ubp <dig> is directly involved in the maintenance of histone h2b ubiquitination levels, that is critical for the transcriptional and cell cycle response to dna damage  <cit> . such observations are particularly interesting since the major epigenetic mechanisms controlling histone modifications and nucleosome remodelling are extremely well conserved between yeast and higher organisms  <cit> . consequently, ubp <dig> inactivation induced a transcriptional oxidative stress response accompanied by a subpopulation of apoptotic cells which accumulated reactive oxygen species  <cit> . the corresponding human homolog gene has not been yet described. although significant progress has been made in the characterization of enzymes that ligate ub to target proteins in humans, little is known about the removal of ub from ub-conjugates. yet, the activity of ub-specific proteases  is likely to be central to the regulation of all processes in which ub is involved, both removing ub to rescue from degradation or by removing residual ub to assist in proteasomal degradation. the human genome encodes 60- <dig> predicted members of the usp family, and at least five major classes have been identified, one of which gathers ub-processing proteases  including ubp <dig>  collectively, several findings identify usps as important regulators of biological processes and potential targets for the treatment of human tumors  <cit> .

ubc <dig> , is a ub-conjugating enzyme , involved in protein ubiquitination, dna repair, dna post-replication repair  and in targeting of lys <dig> histone, similarly to the s. cerevisiae homolog gene ydr092w . in fission yeast, deletion of ubc <dig> results in an increased sensitivity to dna damaging agents, i.e., the alkyating agent methylmethanesulfonate  and uv radiation  <cit> . since the ubiquitination of pcna plays a crucial role in regulating replication past dna damage, this aspect was investigated also in s. pombe  <cit> . in particular, it has been shown that the genetic requirements for mono- and polyubiquitination of pcna are similar to those in s. cerevisiae, namely that monoubiquitination requires rhp18rad <dig>  whereas polyubiquitination requires rad8rad <dig>  ubc <dig> and mms <dig>  <cit> . dna prr is a tolerance mechanism that allows cells to survive dna damage that is unrepaired or unrepairable. prr includes translesion dna synthesis that is "error-prone" and a second activity that is largely "error-free". in budding yeast, the ubc <dig> gene codes for an ub-conjugating enzyme involved in the error-free dna prr pathway. after dna damage, ubc13p interacts with mms2p to assemble ub chains at the ub-lys <dig> residue of pcna, instead of the conventional lys <dig> residue that is the main signal to target a substrate for proteolysis by 26s proteasome. the involvement of ubc <dig> in cellular tolerance to dna damage is further supported by its inducibility in response to treatment with dna-damaging agents such as mms and uv radiation  <cit> . the human homolog of s. pombe ubc <dig>  is ube2n/ubc <dig>  a ub-conjugating enzyme requiring the presence of a ubc variant  for poly-ubiquitination. in particular, divergent activities of mammalian ubc <dig> rely on its pairing with either of two uevs, uev1a or mms <dig>  <cit> .

pmt <dig>  gene product is sumo , one of a number of ub-like protein that are post-translationally covalently attached to one or more lys residues on target proteins. although it has only 18% sequence identity with ub, its structure resembles that of ub. however, unlike ub, mammalian sumo and its budding yeast homologue smt <dig> have been shown to be more important for post-translational protein modification than for protein degradation  <cit> . indeed, sumo modification has a variety of cellular functions, including roles in transcription, dna damage response, cell cycle and nuclear transport. recently, pmt <dig> has been shown to be required for sumo-targeted ub ligase-dependent ubiquitination of target proteins  <cit> . as an example, s. pombe pcna is sumoylated in s phase following dna damage  <cit> . the process of sumoylation resembles that of ubiquitination. sumo is produced as a precursor protein that needs to be cleaved to the mature form by one or more specific sumo-proteases. genetic analyses showed that the pmt <dig> gene is not essential for viability , but it may be essential for the checkpoint coupling mitosis to the completion of dna replication and the dna damage response. deletion mutants for pmt <dig> were strikingly sensitive to the dna synthesis inhibitor hydroxyurea , mms and uv radiation, and the microtubule-destabilizing agent thiabendazole. however, it has been proposed that pmt <dig> is involved in the dna damage tolerance process rather than in the checkpoint itself, similarly to rad <dig>  and hus <dig>   <cit> . in fission yeast, sumoylation is involved also in chromosome segregation and telomere length maintenance. loss of pmt <dig> function caused a striking increase in telomere length  <cit> . more recently, a role for sumo chain formation in response to replication arrest in s. pombe has been established  <cit> . in addition, a variable pattern of response to dna damaging agents has been reported in the budding yeast siz <dig> gene mutant, which is characterized by resistance to anthracyclines  and sensitivity to cisplatin and camptothecin  <cit> . since siz <dig> is an e3-ligase of the sumo pathway, sumoylation defects may impair drug response.

cisplatin-resistant deletion mutants
although we were mainly interested in identifying drug-sensitive mutants with the final goal to establish novel targets for increasing cisplatin sensitivity, the present study allowed us to identify several cisplatin-resistant strains . among these, here we describe those carrying deletions in genes whose human homolog/ortholog has been already described .

ufd <dig> belongs to the ub-conjugation factor "e <dig> family" and is involved in n-terminal ub-fusion degradation  pathway, required for the degradation of oligo-ubiquitinated substrates  <cit> . notably, ufd <dig> has a crucial activity in s. cerevisiae because it binds proteins modified by one or two moieties only, thus harbouring a too short chain for triggering degradation, and is able to catalyze an extension of the multi-ub chain  <cit> . a two-step reaction, i.e., oligo-ubiquitination followed by e4-catalyzed multi-ubiquitination, could offer a double layer of control, giving the possibility for two consecutive functions  <cit> . moreover, ufd <dig> may have a role in retro-translocation and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation  pathway, where misfolded or abnormally assembled proteins are targeted for degradation. importantly, the bulk of ufd <dig> appears to reside in the nucleus, possibly with bound ubiquitinated substrates . the mammalian homolog of yeast ufd2/ufd <dig> is ufd2a/ube4b gene, that contains a u-box at its c-terminus and functions as an e <dig> as well as an e <dig> ub-ligase  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that ufd2a mediates the proteasomal turnover of p <dig> in a ub-independent manner and that it might play an important role in the regulation of cisplatin-induced apoptosis mediated by p <dig>  <cit> . more recently, it has been suggested that ufd2a might regulate also cisplatin-mediated cell death by p <dig>  <cit> .

the spbc <dig>  gene codes for the Î² <dig> subunit of 20s proteasome, whose corresponding ortholog gene in s. cerevisiae is pre <dig>  a mutant strain with defects in pre <dig> displays cycloheximide resistance  <cit> . the corresponding human gene/protein  is evolutionarily conserved and directly interacts with snev , a protein with e <dig> ligase activity, which is also involved in dna double-strand break repair and splicing, whose deficiency results in apoptosis and decreased cell survival after dna damage  <cit> . it has been suggested that psmb <dig> might be a major site for proteasome regulation, where signals from the outside might be transduced inside to the protease activities  <cit> . altered expression of the psmb <dig> gene was recently observed in association with various tumor types  through different approaches  <cit> . interestingly, another human gene coding for the 20s proteasome unit Î²-type  <dig> , is associated with anthracycline resistance and is a prognostic biomarker in breast cancer  <cit> .

rpt6/let <dig> is one of six atpases of the 19s regulatory particle of the 26s proteasome involved in the degradation of ubiquitinated substrates; its s. cerevisiae homolog gene  is bound by ub-protein ligases ubr1p and ufd4p and localized mainly to the nucleus throughout the cell cycle. the rpt <dig> protein  has been found to associate with a number of activators and to be localized on some promoters in mammals  <cit> . in particular, rpt <dig> has been localized on p21waf <dig> promoter where it interacts with p <dig> after dna damage. the knockdown of rpt <dig> results in increased occupancy of the p21waf <dig> promoter by p <dig> and increase transcription of the gene  <cit> .

modulation of ub-proteasome genes by cisplatin
we previously studied genome-wide transcriptional profiles in s. pombe, demonstrating that cisplatin activates a stress response involving genes belonging to different pathways , including ub-proteasome system)  <cit> . in such an analysis, the s. pombe wild-type sensitive strain  <dig> h- was exposed to a cytotoxic cisplatin concentration and modulation of gene expression was examined. the group of transcripts at least two-fold up-regulated by cisplatin in this strain comprised a subset of transcripts belonging to the ub-proteasome pathway . only three of them were found to be included in the present set of non-essential deletion mutants . when we tested cisplatin sensitivity of these specific deletion mutants , we obtained ic <dig> values similar to that of the corresponding wild-type parental strain.

a modulated transcripts are reported for which at least a two-fold up-regulation was found.

b the s. pombe wild-type sensitive strain  <dig>  was exposed to a cisplatin concentration inhibiting colony growth by 80%  after 4h drug exposure.

among the induced transcripts, lub <dig> attracted our attention because a precise and important role in dna damage response has been recently ascribed to its corresponding budding yeast homolog gene, doa1/ufd <dig>  <cit> . in particular, doa <dig> has been shown to help to control the dna damage response by channelling ub from the proteasomal degradation pathway into pathways that mediate altered dna replication and chromatin modification, thus acting in supplying ub for the dna damage response. elements of the dna damage response that appear to rely on doa <dig> include the ubiquitination of both pcna and histone h2b. indeed, doa <dig> interacts with other factors involved in producing or maintaining ubiquitinated both pcna and h2b, i.e., ubc <dig> and ubp <dig> . thus, such an observation suggests a link between three different factors belonging to the ub-proteasome pathway identified in s. pombe with two different approaches , and possibly involved in cellular response to cisplatin. moreover, the lack of cisplatin-hypersensitivity observed in our lub <dig> deletion mutant , may reflect the presence of redundant factors as suggested by lis and romesberg  <cit> . indeed, in budding yeast doa1Î and ubi4Î mutants share several phenotypes including sensitivity to heat, canavanine and other dna-damaging agents   <cit> . in contrast, the budding yeast ubi <dig> deletion mutant displays resistance to cisplatin together with other mutants of the proteasome pathway including bul <dig>  ubp <dig>  ufd <dig> and ump <dig>  <cit> . both ubi <dig>  and doa <dig> might supply ub for the dna damage response. similarly, in fission yeast the corresponding ubi <dig> homolog gene  may replace lub <dig> absence. accordingly, ubi <dig> gene expression resulted up-regulated by cisplatin in our previous study, similarly to lub <dig> .

as reported in table  <dig>  the human ortholog of s. pombe lub <dig> and s. cerevisiae doa1/ufd <dig>  is phospholipase a <dig> -activating protein , that has been implicated in a variety of biological processes that involve the ub system  <cit> . in particular, it has been linked to the maintenance of ub levels, but the mechanism by which it accomplishes this is unclear  <cit> . interestingly, it has been recently demonstrated that human plaa enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis in hela cells  <cit> . transcriptional induction of plaa by cisplatin can potentially promote cytotoxicity through phospholipase a <dig> activation and arachidonic acid accumulation. interestingly, carboplatin-sensitive cells from ovarian cancer patients expressed higher levels of plaa than their resistant counterparts  <cit> . the c-terminal domain of plaa binds p97/cdc <dig>  an aaa atpase which, among other functions, helps in transferring ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome for degradation  <cit> . in addition, plaa is also associated with hdac <dig>  a unique cytoplasmic deacetylase capable of interacting with ub and a master regulator of the cell protective response to cytotoxic protein aggregate formation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
to maintain the genome, cells have evolved multiple pathways to detect and respond to dna damage. the cellular response to dna damage has been particularly well characterized in the fission yeast s. pombe. an important way in which various organisms coordinate facets of the dna damage response is the post-translational modification of proteins. while phosphorylation has received a great deal of attention, it has become increasingly clear that other types of post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, also play critical roles. ub is an essential modifier conserved in all eukaryotes from yeast to human and existing in several cellular compartments. during normal growth, a significant portion of ub is used to target proteins for proteasomal degradation, and it is presumably sequestered within these pathways. however, in the presence of dna damage, ub must be quickly made available for post-translational modification of proteins involved in sensing, repairing, and/or tolerating the damage . the present study supports that specific proteasome genes can contribute differently to cisplatin response. only a few of yeast genes appear to regulate sensitivity per se suggesting pathway redundancy. the prospective identification of novel targets for modulation of cisplatin sensitivity in an eukaryotic model organism appeared particularly intriguing towards the discovery of strategies to overcome cisplatin resistance in human tumors. in principle, a variety of approaches may be employed in an attempt to sensitize cancer cells to cisplatin . in the context of the ub-proteasome pathway, the development of small molecules is still at an early stage, but some research groups are already looking at attacking components of the ub-proteasome pathway  <cit> . in this regard, the definition of the interactome of the specific enzymes is crucial to select the most promising druggable targets. also, a major effort is required to better understand pathway redundancy because, although ubiquitin ligases have shown a high degree of substrate specificity, their inhibition may be counteracted by the activation of alternative pathway components critical for cell survival maintenance. the level of complexity of the ub-proteasome pathway is high as also deubiquitinases can be regarded as druggable targets . moreover, the pairing of the pathway components with different substrates may result in divergent activities  <cit> .

in the present study, we identified three ub-proteasome mutants exhibiting hypersensitivity to cisplatin, i.e., ubp <dig>  ubc <dig> and pmt <dig>  although with very distinct functions, the proteins encoded by those genes play critical roles for dna damage response, thereby representing attractive targets to investigate possible mechanisms of cisplatin resistance in human tumor cell systems . with respect to factors whose loss confers cisplatin resistance, ufd <dig> might play a role in cisplatin-induced apoptosis  <cit> . our screening also highlighted the importance of the Î² <dig> subunit of 20s proteasome, whose corresponding human ortholog gene is psmb <dig>  since psmb <dig> is implicated in proteasomal degradation of snev, the absence of psmb <dig> may produce resistance as a consequence of increased survival favoured by snev  <cit> .

to the best of our knowledge, none of the budding yeast homologues of the fission yeast mutants described in the present study has been previously linked to cisplatin response.

when we compared the present screening results with those obtained in previous global gene expression study, the importance of lub <dig> emerged. indeed, the corresponding budding yeast ortholog gene  has a precise and important role in dna damage response and appears to regulate the ubiquitination of both pcna and histone h2b, through the interaction with ubc <dig>  and ubp <dig> . pcna is at the very heart of many essential cellular processes, such as dna replication, repair of dna damage, chromatin structure maintenance, chromosome segregation and cell-cycle progression. this puts pcna in a central position in determining the fate of replication fork, which ultimately determines both tumor progression as well as the outcome of anticancer treatment  <cit> . in addition, recent advances have defined a clear role for histone h2b ubiquitination in transcriptional regulation and the enzymes regulating this post-translational modification have been linked to tumorigenesis  <cit> .

in summary, we can conclude that the cell sensitivity screening shown in the present study, together with evidences resulting from previous s. pombe gene expression analysis, uncover novel putative targets for modulation of cisplatin sensitivity, particularly intriguing towards the discovery of strategies to overcome cisplatin in human tumors.
