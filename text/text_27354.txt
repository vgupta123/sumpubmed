BACKGROUND
the qatari peninsula, located on the eastern coast of the arabian peninsula, is at a major crossroads of human migration  <cit> . this geographical location has led to several waves of settlement over the past millennia, creating unique ethnic ancestries that form the present day’s population. we previously described  <dig> major genetic subgroups of qataris, including those of bedouin , persian-south asian , and african ancestry  . although all three share a common environment, there is a significant level of segregation among the populations, with a higher level of consanguinity observed in q <dig> and to a certain extent q <dig>  over q <dig>  leading to the formation of  <dig> distinguishable genetic pools. exome sequencing has shown that each subpopulation has different predispositions to various mendelian diseases, an observation with consequences for public health planning in the context of pre-existing premarital screening programs  <cit> .

whereas classic mendelian disorders are generally defined by single nucleotide polymorphism’s , there is increasing evidence that copy number variation  also play a significant role in disease . cnvs in the  <dig>  kb to several mb size range account for up to 4 % of the human genome, and generally behave like snps – having a detectable minor allele frequency, existing in linkage disequilibrium  with neighboring snps on variable length haplotypes and being inherited in mendelian fashion  <cit> . unlike snps, however, cnvs could be extremely multi-allelic , and may therefore contribute to continuous traits by causing a spectrum of variation in gene dosage  <cit> . though common cnvs have traditionally shown relatively poor association with common disease  <cit> , intermediate frequency  and rare  but recurrent cnvs cause a variety of disorders, including extreme obesity, congenital heart disease, and a wide spectrum of neurological and developmental disorders .

because of the high degree of consanguinity in the qatari population, it is likely that cnvs, alongside snps and indels, play a role in the inherited disease risk burden in this population  <cit> . further, because of the cultural segregation of the major genetic groups  within the qatari population, it is likely that there are novel cnv regions  specific to each group, representing distinct subpopulation histories and risk for disease. in the context of these considerations, we have used complete genome sequencing along with snp microarray analysis of  <dig> qataris  to assess the spectrum of cnvs and cnvrs in the qatari population, representing the first high-resolution, genome-wide assessment of the burden of small to medium-sized chromosomal deletions and duplications in a middle eastern arab population. this work on the cnv class of mutations is complementary to a study from our group describing ancestry, polymorphisms and disease susceptibility from the single nucleotide variant class of mutations from these same individuals  <cit> .

RESULTS
detection of cnvs
to identify cnvs in the qatari population, primary data was obtained from arrays and whole-genome sequencing sources, and then called and integrated as described in methods . briefly, cnv calls were first generated in the  <dig> individuals from illumina’s omni <dig>  m array intensity data using both cnvpartition  and quantisnp  <cit> , and, separately, from ngs using cn.mops  <cit> , in addition to cnv calls provided by illumina from wgs data. altogether, there were two primary datasets called by  <dig> independent algorithms each, and all  <dig> subsequently combined for final cnv calls as described below.fig.  <dig> cnv analysis strategy. cnv detection in qataris was assessed at two tiers. first, cnvs were called in  <dig> individuals using two algorithms each, on two primary input datasets: genotyping array  and next-generation whole genome sequencing reads . a size cut-off of at least  <dig> consecutive probes for genotyping data and at least  <dig> consecutive windows for whole genome sequencing data was used to increase specificity . three samples with an unusually high number of cnvs were first removed from the population . in the second step, high-quality cnvs from the remaining  <dig> subjects called by all  <dig> platforms were distributed into  <dig> individual files. cnvs were first compared intra-individuals and retained if observed by more than one algorithm. if no overlap was detected within the individual, the cnv was compared inter-individuals to detect a second occurrence in the remaining  <dig> individuals. cnvs observed only once in the entire sample were discarded. cnvs passing these filters were merged across the population to generate population level cnv regions , which were taken into the detailed analysis steps. *denotes data was provided as-is from proprietary illumina genome network sequencing pipeline without the ability of the user to alter parameters



preliminary qualitative inspection of the raw distribution of all cnvs in the  <dig> individuals revealed  <dig> outlier samples with a large excess of cnv calls . these individuals significantly skewed the average number of cnvs in the population  and were therefore removed from further consideration, yielding a cohort of  <dig> individuals in whom all subsequent analysis was conducted.

the  <dig> platforms initially identified a total of  <dig>  cnvs from all  <dig> algorithms in the  <dig> individuals, including  <dig>  putative deletions  and  <dig>  putative duplications . the excess of duplications over deletions is largely a result of cnvs provided by illumina’s proprietary wgs calls, which reported  <dig>  duplications and  <dig>  deletions, with no homozygous deletions  called in the  <dig> samples.table  <dig> copy number variations in the qatari populationa

afour different algorithms were applied to detect cnvs in  <dig> individuals. for analysis of the illumina omni <dig>  m array data, quantisnp   <cit>  and illumina’s cnvpartition  were used; for next-generation-sequencing  genomic data, cn.mops   <cit>  was used with additional cnv calls provided by illumina’s genome-sequencing service . shown are the numbers of cnvs detected by each algorithm in each copy number class, along with the total number of cnvs detected by copy number  class and by cnv platform. cn  class 0 = homozygous deletions; cn 1 = heterozygous deletions; cn 3 = single-allele duplication; cn 4 + = amplifications. total deletions and duplications are a sum of cn classes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  4+, respectively. total cnvs and size are shown by platform and by class. as expected, array-based methods generated fewer but larger cnvs, whereas ngs based methods generated more but, on the average, smaller cnvs. the number of cnvs per individual is shown for the average and median individual amongst  <dig> individuals who passed the qc. cnv counts are shown by cn class. additionally, the size of genomic content that is altered by cnvs in each cn class in the average and median individuals are provided. as described in methods, these cnvs were merged across individuals within the same subpopulation to arrive at subpopulation level cnv regions . the number of cnvrs within each subpopulation is given for each cn class, and the size of the average cnvr within each class is also shown. within a population, there are sites that sometimes contain both deletions and duplications in different individuals; these are tallied in a column labeled ‘polymorphic’ cnvrs and represent about 15 % of all cnvrs within a given population. finally, the total size of all non-overlapping cnv regions within each subpopulation is shown in the last column. the  <dig> genetic subpopulations are q <dig> , q <dig> , and q <dig> 



in order to enhance specificity, we devised an approach to integrate cnv calls across all  <dig> platforms, requiring a cnv to be observed at least twice to be retained . in this step, each of the  <dig>  raw, high quality cnvs was first compared to all other cnvs detected by any of the four platforms within the same individual file, and those observed twice  were included in the ‘final’ variant file for that individual. all cnvs observed only once were then compared across all other individuals to look for a second occurrence in another individual. if found, that cnv was retained in the individual’s ‘final’ variant file, or otherwise discarded. this allowed for significant refinement of the list of cnvs in the population, eliminating all singleton cnv occurrences in the population – usually the most enriched for spurious calls. using this approach, the average individual’s ‘final’ genome had  <dig> high-confidence cnvs, comprising  <dig> homozygous deletions,  <dig> single-copy deletions,  <dig> single-copy duplications and  <dig> amplifications .

during this filtration and integration process, all cnvs were concurrently curated to re-define breakpoints based on the source of cnvs. briefly, whenever ngs-derived cnvs overlapped array-cnvs, we used the ngs’s higher-resolution breakpoints to define the start and/or end coordinate of the duplication or deletion. wherever two cnvs detected from the same platform were observed to overlap, the narrower breakpoints were chosen, yielding a shorter, more conservative cnv call. after this curation, the ‘final’ cnv content in the average qatari genome affected a total of  <dig>  ×  <dig> non-redundant bases . this is slightly lower than previously published estimates  <cit>  and may reflect the strict filtration and breakpoint definition thresholds applied in this study.

the median qatari genome, based on the four different algorithms and platforms, contained  <dig> high-resolution cnvs, covering an estimated total of  <dig> ,857 bp . these were distributed into the  <dig> cn classes: cn– <dig> ,  <dig> cnvs, affecting  <dig>  mb; cn– <dig> ,  <dig> cnvs, affecting  <dig>  mb; cn– <dig> ,  <dig>  affecting  <dig>  mb; and cn–4+ ,  <dig>  affecting  <dig>  mb. the excess number and larger size of duplications could be explained by a higher proportion of duplications detected by our ngs-cnv callers , and may reflect a combination of reads mapping to segmental duplications and the fact that we included all multi-allelic cnvs with more than  <dig> copies in the same amplification group  <cit> . of  <dig> cnvs,  <dig>  were detected by ngs alone,  <dig>  were detected by array technology only, and  <dig>  were detected by both, suggesting that the two datasets may both be beneficial in representing the total cnv content within an individual, and relying on only one may not be sufficient to cover all variation .

cnv distribution in qatari subpopulations
the  <dig> individuals were examined in the context of the three qatari ancestral subpopulations . in order to evaluate the accuracy of cnv calls, we initially used the cnvs detected across all  <dig> individuals and performed principle component analysis. this analysis separated individuals previously known to belong to q <dig>  q <dig> and q <dig> from genotyping data into their three respective subpopulations based on cnv sharing. the pca plot showed some level of overlap between q <dig> and q <dig> clusters, which could be a result of admixture and our assignment of ethnicity based on only 65 % of  <dig> snps , with q <dig>  being the most clearly distinct subpopulation. these results are similar to those obtained from a pca plot using only snps, as published in  <cit> . the similarity of clustering using pca on cnv and genotyping data in  <dig> qataris is consistent with a previous report demonstrating that pca analysis based on high quality cnvs yields similar clusters to one based on snps from the same individuals  <cit> .

we then inspected the distribution of cnvs by frequency in each class per individual , and observed that, on average, individuals from all three subpopulations had a similar range of cnvs in all four classes. however, in order to detect if the three genetic subpopulations may have differences in the distribution by number or size of cnvs in each cn class, probability curves were generated of cn number  and total size affected  within each cn class for each of the  <dig> subpopulations . for cn class  <dig> , these occurred at a significantly higher frequency in q <dig> and q <dig> over q <dig> . however, this trend was reversed in amplifications , which were found at a higher rate in q <dig> than either q <dig> or q <dig> . these observations may reflect higher consanguinity rates in recent generations within q <dig> and q <dig>  where enrichment in homozygous deletions  but depletion of amplifications vs q <dig>  suggests that homozygous deletions are more harmful than multi-allelic, runaway duplications, and may therefore have been purged from q <dig> by purifying selection over population history but only recently arisen in q <dig> and q <dig>  this possibility is supported by two further observations. first, for single-copy deletions , we observed a significantly higher number in q <dig>  despite the depletion of homozygous deletions relative to the other two subpopulations, suggesting higher diversity and less consanguinity in recent generations among q <dig> qataris vs q <dig> or q <dig>  second, for q <dig>  we observe a slightly longer tail in the size of the genome affected by single copy deletions  despite reduced number of cnvs in that class compared to q <dig>  suggesting these alleles are larger in size and possibly more recent or more deleterious, causing this tail of large cnvs to be absent in the homozygous subset of cnvs in q <dig> .fig.  <dig> probability distributions of cnvs by frequency and size in each copy number class in  <dig> qataris. density curves showing the probability  of a given individual from each of the  <dig> subpopulations having a certain number of cnvs  or a certain cumulative size of the genome affected by cnvs  in each copy number class . all p -values are calculated using the anova-tukey method. black trace – q <dig>  blue trace - q <dig>  red trace – q3



genomic impact of cnvrs in the genetic subpopulations
in order to evaluate the impact of duplications and deletions on each subpopulation individually, we first separately merged deletions and duplications within each group to detect subpopulation-specific cnv regions . there were a total of  <dig>  cnvrs in the  <dig> subpopulations;  <dig>   came from ngs data only,  <dig>  from array only, and  <dig>  from both platforms combined . when deletions and duplications at the same locus  were combined, there were a total of  <dig>  cnvrs, including  <dig> deletions,  <dig> duplications, and  <dig> polymorphic cnvrs .

in the q <dig> subpopulation, there were a total of  <dig> cnvrs of all cn classes, affecting  <dig>  mb of genomic content; in q <dig>   <dig> cnvrs affecting  <dig>  mb, and in q <dig>  <dig> cnvrs affecting  <dig>  mb . the excess number and cumulative size of cnvrs in q <dig> is likely due to the ~3-fold higher number of individuals studied. as expected, the majority of cnvrs were sub-population specific, with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cnvrs at low-frequency  in q <dig>  q <dig> and q <dig> respectively, vs only  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that were common .

functional effect of cnv-affected genes in q <dig>  q <dig> and q3
in order to evaluate the functional effect of deletions and duplications separately on the entire population, the polymorphic cnvrs were separated into their respective cn classes . in total,  <dig>  cnvrs were observed in all four cn classes in the three subpopulations, including  <dig> in q <dig>   <dig> in q <dig> and  <dig> in q <dig>  in all three subpopulations, ~39-40 % of all cnvrs were genic , 4-5 % affected microrna loci , 13-15 % affected promoter sites  and ~38-40 % affected transcription factor binding sites . we focused on genic cnvs in subsequent analysis to determine the extent of cnv impact on genes and pathways and population burden for genetic disease.table  <dig> functional annotation of cnv regions in the qatari genetic subpopulationsa



acnvrs were annotated as described in methods. distribution of cnvs is summarized by cn class within each subpopulation and by functional class including: total number = all cnvrs detected; nongenic = cnvrs that do not overlap coding regions; genic = cnvrs that overlap genes; mirna = cnvrs that overlap micrornas; mendelian disease genes = cnvrs that include at least  <dig> known mendelian disease gene; dgv = cnvrs that overlap a known cnv from the database of genomic variants; novel = cnvrs that do not overlap known cnvs and are unique to qataris; novel genic = the subset of novel cnvrs that overlap at least  <dig> gene; promoter site = cnvrs that overlap promoter elements; transcription factor site = cnvrs that overlap at least  <dig> transcription factor site. total for each subpopulation is a sum of deletions and duplications in each subpopulation



genic pathway enrichment
the genes affected by cnvrs in all qataris were evaluated by standard pathway analysis against the kegg pathway database using the david bioinformatics suite . among the top  <dig> pathways enriched for by genes affected by all cnvs in qataris, we observed several of potential concern for public health . these included genes involved in starch and sugar metabolism, in the insulin signaling pathway, and in type i and type ii diabetes mellitus . among these genes was the amylase enzyme amy <dig>  for which decreased copy number was previously shown to be associated with obesity  <cit> . of interest,  <dig> of  <dig> individuals in the cohort had type  <dig> diabetes , but there was no statistical enrichment for any of these cnvs in obese or diabetic individuals vs controls. this may be due to the low power in small sample size, combined with the possibility that individuals labeled as controls have yet to develop diabetes due to their young age at time of assessment . we also observed nominal enrichment in other medically relevant pathways, including drug metabolism and non-small cell lung cancer . together, these observations suggest that cnvs in this population may affect public health by contributing to the burden of chronic disease in the population and should be assessed systematically in a larger cohort to establish power and assess significance.table  <dig> top  <dig> kegg pathways enriched in genes affected by cnvs in qatarisa

cnvs affecting mendelian disease genes
in order to determine whether cnvs may also play a role in rare disease in qataris, we compared all genes affected by cnvrs to the database of online mendelian inheritance in man . in all three subpopulations, approximately 10 % of all genic cnvrs affected at least  <dig> omim gene . the omim database contains a combination of disease causing genes, as well as disease-associated genes and genes affecting polymorphic traits. because we were most interested in genes that have sufficient evidence of disease-causality from the literature, we re-annotated all cnv-encompassed omim genes based on their published role in causing disease, and then manually curated all putative omim-gene-containing cnvrs to determine the exact number of exons that were likely to be disrupted by each cnv .

the focus was on the subset of cnvrs most likely to have a functional impact on a gene. these include deletions affecting any number of exons and duplications that either encompass at least one entire gene  or are internal to the gene . we therefore eliminated from consideration all intronic events as well as duplications that were partially genic . we then split the list of omim-affected genes into two groups:  genes in which cnvrs had been previously reported; and  genes affected by novel, qatari-specific cnvrs. in the former group, we found a total of  <dig> disrupted disease-causing genes  affected by  <dig> unique cnvr loci  . these cnvrs had variable distribution among the  <dig> subpopulations, with most being specific to one or two populations while only  <dig> were observed in all  <dig> subpopulations. thus, the majority of mendelian-disease-gene containing cnvrs is population-specific, and may predispose to disease due to high levels of intra-population mating. further, though these cnvrs are marked as previously reported due to overlap with cnvrs in the database of genomic variants   <cit> , it is possible due to the variable breakpoints of cnvs deposited in the dgv that these qatari cnvs affect different exons or occur at a higher frequency in this population than the rest of the world.table  <dig> qatari genetic subpopulation-specific distribution of known cnv regions deletions affecting known mendelian disease genesa



agenes affected by cnvrs in each subpopulation were looked up in the database for online mendelian inheritance in man  for confirmed role in disease. disease name, mim number  and gene appear in the first two columns, followed by cnvr-centric information and sub-population-centric data. start-end: coordinates of cnv containing omim gene; deleted/duplicated exons: exons from each gene within the boundaries of the deletion or duplication

we also examined omim-gene-containing cnvrs that were novel to qataris. to determine novelty here, qatari cnvrs were compared to cnvrs reported in the  <dig> genomes phase i  <cit>  study that were detected through next-generation sequencing with high-resolution breakpoints. only  <dig> qatari cnvrs passed this filter, reflecting the high diversity of populations represented in the  <dig> genomes data. these cnvrs included  <dig> deletions and  <dig> duplications . five of these cnvrs were qatari sub-population-specific, while nine were shared by  <dig> or more sub-populations. of the shared cnvrs, there were four deletions – one of exon  <dig> in the chediak-higashi syndrome gene lyst  observed in one q <dig> and one q <dig> individuals, one in the glutaric acidemia gene etfdh  in one q <dig> and one q <dig> individuals, one in exons  <dig> to  <dig> of the alpha-methyl acetoacetic aciduria gene acat <dig>  in one q <dig> and one q <dig> individuals, and one in exons 1- <dig> of the gitelman syndrome gene solute carrier  <dig>  family member  <dig>  observed in one q <dig> and two q <dig> individuals. all of these disorders are autosomal recessive and these deletions putatively truncate the genes and therefore predispose these subpopulations to these diseases if present in homozygous state. additionally, there was one disease-gene affecting cnvr that was present in  <dig> individuals from all three subpopulations , a 3 kb internal duplication of exons 13- <dig> of pms <dig> , a gene in which mutations in both alleles are observed in patients with hereditary nonpolyposis cancer and mismatch repair cancer syndrome. additionally,  <dig> other individuals  had a smaller  deletion affecting the same exons. in total,  <dig> individuals  had a cnv not present in public databases that putatively disrupts pms <dig>  of note, colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer in qatari males and third most common in females  <cit> ; whether this gene contributes to the burden of colorectal cancer in this population is currently not known.table  <dig> novel qatari-specific cnvrs affecting omim disease genesa

qatari cnvs affecting known disease cytobands
there has been substantial evidence implicating cnv mutations in a range of diseases, including obesity, congenital heart disease and a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders . in particular, there is a growing body of literature suggesting rare but recurrent cnvs at several loci are responsible for a proportion of these diseases in sporadic cohorts  <cit> . we sought to determine the burden of cnvs by chromosomal cytoband to detect any enrichment in qatari arabs over global cohorts. because the database of genomic variants  contains > <dig>  cnvrs from > <dig> studies  <cit>  detected using a wide variety of low- and high-resolution platforms, we limited this comparison to cnvrs detected by an equally high-resolution platform  in the diverse  <dig> genomes project phase i study   <cit> . all cnvrs reported in the 1000gp <dig> dataset and from our study in each of the  <dig> qatari subpopulations were annotated by cytoband. of  <dig> cytobands in the  <dig> human chromosomes,  <dig> contained cnvrs in the  <dig> genomes samples; of these,  <dig> had cnvrs in q <dig>   <dig> in q <dig>  and  <dig> in q <dig>  there were several cytobands observed in which unique cnvrs were observed at a much higher frequency  in any one of the qatari subpopulations than in the phase i data. among the top  <dig> cytobands  with the highest enrichment were several disease-associated hotspot loci, including: 1q <dig>  , in which recurrent cnvs have been observed in patients with schizophrenia and congenital heart disease; 5q <dig>  , a locus associated with neurological disorders and alcohol dependence, 16p <dig>  , a locus highly associated with autism, schizophrenia and childhood obesity; and 1p <dig>  , a locus associated with disorders of sexual development and obesity . cnvrs in these loci may contribute to the collective burden of these disorders in the qatari population.table  <dig> top  <dig> cytobands in which qatari genetic subpopulations’ cnvrs were observed at a significantly higher frequency than in  <dig> genomes phase i cnv dataa

determining tagging probes for qatari cnvrs
the illumina omni <dig>  m array was developed as a global population-based genotyping tool to integrate variation down to minor allele frequency  > <dig>  % from the diverse populations represented in the  <dig> genomes project  <cit> . we first sought to estimate the utility of the illumina omni  <dig>  m array for studying the qatari population. to assess the amount of “informative” snps on the omni <dig>  m array in this population, we used genotypes from a total of  <dig> qataris genotyped on this platform. the omni  <dig>  m snps were first pruned for those that had a call in at least 90 % of the  <dig> individuals , which resulted in  <dig> , <dig> . surprisingly, of these,  <dig>  snps  were monomorphic  in  <dig> qataris. additionally,  <dig>   had a maf of less than 1 % in qataris, and  <dig> , <dig>  have a minor allele frequency of less than 5 %. therefore, in total less than 60 % of the snps on the omni  <dig>  m array adequately sample common variants in qataris .

nevertheless, we attempted to assess whether a subset of these snps tag common cnvs in this population, which could be useful for imputation of arab-population cnvs from genetic data using this or similar arrays in future studies. in order to increase specificity, we focused on  <dig> common deletions  across the  <dig> individuals in this study, and investigated the pairwise correlation between the deletion cnv and all snps within 500 kb either side of the deletion’s breakpoints. as expected, while  <dig> cnvs  had at least  <dig> snp within 500 kb of either breakpoint, the majority of snps from the omni  <dig>  m array neighboring cnvs did not adequately tag the deletion allele, with the majority of snps  having a maximum r2 <  <dig>  . in fact, only  <dig> of  <dig> deletions were tagged by at least one snp at a pearson correlation of r2 >  <dig> , of which only  <dig>  were tagged at r2 >  <dig>  . further, of the  <dig> genic subset of cnvs within the  <dig> deletions, only 35 % were tagged by an array snps with a correlation r2 >  <dig> , and less than 7 % appeared in complete ld . therefore, the majority of deletions common to the qatari population were poorly tagged by the high density omni  <dig>  m array, which could pose significant challenges to using this or other commercial arrays to genotype cnvs in arab populations.fig.  <dig> all snps within 500 kb of start and end breakpoints of  <dig>  deletions were used to detect for each deletion a snp with the maximum pairwise ld correlation. this was done both for a. all  <dig> cnvs and b. for only  <dig> genic cnvs. in both cases, the wgs snvs significantly outperformed the omni <dig>  m snps, especially at higher r <dig> values. wgs-snvs: whole genome sequencing detected variants . omni <dig>  m-snps: snps present on the omni <dig>  m array 



in order to rectify this issue, we sought to determine a set of snps that could better tag these cnvs by relying on genotypes obtained from the whole genome sequencing of these  <dig> individuals . all ~ <dig> million high-quality variants detected in  <dig> individuals were first pruned for those within 500 kb upstream and downstream of each cnv breakpoint, and then ld measured between each cnv and all neighboring snps within this window. there was a highly significant improvement of up to 250 % for all cnvs and almost  <dig>  times that  for genic cnvs at r2 =  <dig> . with whole genome sequencing snps, we observed >70 % of all deletions being tagged by at least one snp at an r2 >  <dig> , and over 50 % at r2 >  <dig> , suggesting these could be imputed in future experiments from sequence data. in order to facilitate the design of new genotyping arrays that tag cnvs in this population, we include a list of deletion-tagging genotypes at snps tagging  <dig> cnvs at r2 >  <dig>  . we also include this information at greater detail in the accompanying additional file  <dig> containing the complete cnv dataset with all functional annotation in  <dig> qataris.

discussion
this study uses two primary datasets called by four separate algorithms to generate the first catalog of high-resolution copy number variants within qataris, a population that shares significant genetic ancestry with the neighboring populations of the arabian gulf who remain under represented in public databases. our analysis reveals several notable features of copy number changes in this region of the world. first, cnv distribution patterns among members of the different qatari subpopulations is concordant with their cultural and demographic histories, where higher consanguinity in q <dig> and q <dig> populations has led to a significantly higher number of homozygous deletions vs the more diverse q <dig> individuals. notably, these deletions are larger in size, and may be useful for studies of the effect of gene-loss on individual fitness, similar to studies of loss of function mutations in large but seemingly healthy cohorts. further, a large proportion of cnvrs across all  <dig> qatari subpopulations affect coding or functional elements , including known rare, severe disease genes and loci. of particular interest is the increased burden of cnvs in certain kegg pathways relevant to population health in qatar and in the region, such as diabetes, insulin signaling and metabolism.

while all  <dig> individuals analyzed here are phenotypically “control” adults, the possibility that the cnvs they carry might be associated with disease cannot be ruled out. cnvs have been shown to play a role both in population diversity and in pathophysiology, where increased or decreased gene dosage may be responsible for human phenotypic variability as well as complex behavioral traits and disease . indeed, we observe a significantly higher burden of cnvs in cytobands linked to known, rare syndromic disorders. thus, the qatari population could be at risk for any of these cnv-related disorders under a two-hit model, where incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity may depend on a second insult, possibly a point mutation, at an interacting locus  <cit> . further, we found a number of cnvs that were shared within the qatari population  affecting severe mendelian disease causing genes, including recurrent hits  in pms <dig>  a gene that is often mutated in colon cancer, the second most prevalent cancer in qatar  <cit> . these observations will be informative in the design of the next generation of clinical copy number arrays for use with this population.

a distinctive feature of this study is in combining high-resolution cnv calls from whole genome sequencing with the traditional cnv calls from genotyping array data, which demonstrated a non-trivial number of cnvs detected exclusively by only one platform. this held true despite high specificity thresholds implemented to reduce spurious calls, suggesting that relying on only one of these platforms risks eliminating a substantial amount of the underlying variation. this hybrid strategy uncovered approximately  <dig> cnvs of size range  <dig>  kb to 2 mb in the median qatari individual, affecting a total of ~28 mb of genomic dna. this is slightly lower than previously published high-resolution studies that estimate cnvs affect up to 40 mb of genomic dna  <cit> , and may be due to a combination of our higher minimum size thresholds  and the strict specificity criteria we employed, which eliminated all singletons. nevertheless, we observed that up to 40 % of cnvrs affected genic content, suggesting these could contribute to key traits yet to be fully understood in the general population.

as an additional analysis, we determined the usefulness of the omni <dig>  m array to genotype cnvs in this population. the performance of this array was relatively poor, with <35 % of cnvs tagged at r2 >  <dig> . we decided instead to leverage the genotypes obtained from whole genome sequencing of these same individuals and found substantial improvements to discovering tagging snps for these population-level deletions . these snps could be included in future arrays designed to genotype arab cohorts, and used to impute these deletions in qatari or ancestrally similar gulf arabs.

this study, with its small population size, is underpowered to discover any significant effect of cnvrs on common disease in the population. however, it provides the first step in creating a database of qatari-specific cnvrs that sets the landscape for future research to assess rare and common cnvs in a much larger qatari cohort. we suspect that the qatari population’s unique burden of rare and chronic disease will provide a strong platform for discovery of functional cnvs in future studies. this is especially critical, for example, in the burden of deletions disrupting known disease genes , which may appear in homozygous state in the highly consanguineous qatari population. indeed, of particular interest for human disease studies is the significantly higher proportion of homozygous deletions in q1s and q2s, which could shed light on the subset of the genome that is “dispensable” for normal human development into adulthood due to loss of gene function . in this study, we find  <dig> genes that are affected by homozygous deletions, yet appear to cause no overt phenotypic abnormalities in this group of  <dig> seemingly healthy adults.

in recent years, each of genotyping arrays, array-cgh microarrays, and next-generation sequencing have all been implemented successfully to detect structural variation in human cohorts . while the majority of studies continue with hapmap cohorts, there has been a recent increase in the number of reports from non-hapmap populations, the majority of which are still ancestrally similar to pre-existing hapmap populations  . to date, however, there has been no systematic characterization of cnvs in gulf arabs, a population witnessing a growth in clinical genomics testing but whose ancestry is not adequately represented in current hapmap and  <dig> genomes populations. we present this study as the first systematic approach that makes available data on a large number of cnvs detected from both genotyping and sequencing platforms in this previously under-explored population, and believe the frequency of cnvs reported in this study could be used to assess the pathogenicity of clinically detected cnvs in gulf arab patients that appear novel to public databases. thus, this high-resolution map of cnvs in qataris is likely representative of ethnically similar gulf-arabs, and the accompanying database will inform future studies with larger cohorts aimed at understanding the unique population history in this region and the interpretation and analysis of clinically-observed cnvs in patients.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, there is little doubt that some proportion of disease burden in certain patient cohorts can be explained by cnvs . as detection methods continue to improve, so will the discovery of new genes and loci whose deletion or duplication could lead to morbid clinical phenotypes in specific populations. this kind of population specificity will have detrimental effects on the design of population-specific clinical chg-arrays, and on the interpretation and assignment of pathogenicity of cnv findings in individuals from different ethnic populations . this issue is of special relevance to arabs in general and qataris specifically, for whom there is a paucity of databases of cnvs observed in healthy controls.

in this study, we generate a highly dense catalog of  <dig>  cnvrs in a cohort of  <dig> qataris, by employing strict qc criteria for detection of cnvs and by integrating data from both snp arrays and ngs technologies to achieve high-resolution breakpoint annotation for most variants. we find that ~40 % of these cnvrs affect genic and functional content, and that >5 % of all cnvs discovered are novel when compared to the well-populated database of genomic variants  <cit> , and thus represent polymorphisms in this population that may be misinterpreted as disease-causing in clinical cases in the absence of population-matched controls. interestingly, despite the small sample size, we observe genes affected by these cnvrs that function in biological pathways relevant to population health, including mendelian disease-causing genes reported in omim.genes involved in diabetes and carbohydrate metabolism, genes implicated in cancer, as well as homozygous deletions affecting up to  <dig> unique genes in seemingly healthy individuals. these are likely underestimates resulting from our strict quality filtration criteria . nevertheless, these findings pave the way for follow-up studies in larger cohorts with sufficient power and phenotypic information to determine their true contribution to disease burden in this population. finally, we leverage the genotypes obtained from next-generation sequencing to identify snps that are at high linkage disequilibrium with sub-population-specific deletions, allowing their imputation in future studies of matched cohorts. this study therefore complements pre-existing and future next-generation sequencing work in qataris, and presents findings which improve our understanding of cnv prevalence as a class of previously underexplored variation in this population, and their contribution to disease in qataris, and possibly in ethnically similar gulf arabs.
