BACKGROUND
in the past, markers on the non-recombining region of the y chromosome  have been used extensively as a male complement to mtdna to study the colonization or migration histories within the different regions of the world. y-chromosomal haplogroup  q, defined by either of the binary markers p36/meh <dig>  <cit>  or m <dig>  <cit> , has been suggested to originate in asia and represent recent founder paternal native american radiation into the americas. in eurasia, haplogroup q chromosomes have been reported with the highest frequency in siberian populations, distributed primarily across northwest and northeast siberia with the vast majority in only two siberian populations, the kets  and the selkups   <cit> . other population groups from the region bearing this haplogroup include, kyrgyz , kazak , kallar , shiraz , bartangi , korean , yagnobi , esfahan , turkmen , dungan , tuvinian , uzbek/kashkadarya , shugnan , uzbek/bukhara , uzbek/surkhandarya , yadhava , kazan tatar , tajik/samarkand , uighur , uzbek/khorezm , uzbek/tashkent , arab/bukhara , uzbek/fergana valley  and uzbek/samarkand 7%)  <cit> . interestingly, y-hg q is the youngest paternal haplogroup observed with less frequent subgroups which are geographically restricted. these have been delineated into q <dig>  q <dig> and q <dig> subgroups defined by biallelic markers m <dig>  m25/m <dig> and m <dig>  respectively <cit> . recently, a novel subgroup q <dig> was identified, defined by the bi-allelic marker m <dig>  representing hg q  in indian populations  <cit> .

with very less details of hg q in asia, especially india, it was pertinent to explore the status of the y-hg q in indian populations to gather an insight to determine the extent of diversity within this region.

RESULTS
in the present study, we screened  <dig> samples belonging to different regions of india and observed  <dig> %  individuals bearing y-hg q. it was interesting to observe that 14/ <dig> samples did not show any of the already known y-hg q sub-haplogroups , defined by biallelic markers m <dig>  m25/m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig>  respectively . only one individual was observed with the presence of m <dig> polymorphism, representing q <dig> lineage.

further, a novel  <dig> bp del/ins polymorphism  at  <dig>  position of human arylsulfatase d pseudogene , in 5/ <dig> individuals  indicated the presence of a novel sub-group q <dig> of y-hg q. in order to establish the exclusiveness of this polymorphism to y-hg q, we screened some of our samples already categorized in other unrelated haplogroups like r1a <dig>  r <dig>  l, h <dig>  j, c, etc. the presence of an ancestral allele  in these samples confirmed the restriction of this novel polymorphism within the y-hg q. we also screened the sample with a derived state at m <dig> marker in the present study , using ss <dig> bp marker and found an absence of the polymorphism. in order to assign an independent status to designated q <dig> and to confirm the placement of m <dig> derived samples as q <dig>  <cit> , it was necessary to study the novel ss <dig> bp marker  in m <dig> derived samples . three samples provided on request were screened for the ss <dig> bp polymorphism. the absence of this polymorphism in these three samples not only confirmed the authenticity of q <dig> lineage but also validated the independent status of q <dig> observed by us . in addition to the y-hg q <dig>  and q <dig>  samples, there were 9/ <dig>  individuals who did not show any of the known q subgroup signature and were designated as q*.

in order to put together our observations along with those made in literature earlier, we pooled data of  <dig> y- chromosomes   for analyses, of which 21/ <dig>  samples represented q lineage in india. all of our  <dig> samples and  <dig> samples belonging to y-hg q <dig>  <cit>  were genotyped for  <dig> y-microsatellite markers. however, to keep uniformity in evaluation, data of  <dig> overlapping y-str markers from present study and from different population groups of central asia and india was used to construct median joining network  <cit> , although  <dig> y-str markers were analysed by us . for most of the indian y-hg q and its sub-lineages, three clusters of y-str haplotypes were observed . one cluster included all the three q <dig> and one q*, another with all the q <dig> and the third with most of the q* bearing individuals. it was interesting to find that most of the indian q  associated y-str haplotypes were separated from the bulk of central asian q* associated haplotypes. further, the clustering of the y-str haplotypes reassured the findings by the bi-allelic markers. this could either be due to population differentiation or because of the presence of these clusters in the ancestral migration from central asia, not clear at the moment. the increased diversity within the indian population clusters could be interpreted as an overall effect of geographical differentiation, population expansions and severe bottlenecks resulting in loss of many of the in-between haplotypes thus, reducing the reticulation and increasing the branch lengths. it could also be as a result of independent migrations and admixture.

the age estimations made using a small sample size need to be increased which is not feasible at the moment, keeping in mind a very low frequency of y-hg q in india. the age estimation for haplogroup q in india was carried out on the bigger cluster bearing q* and q <dig> in the median joining network. the calculated age of  <dig> . <dig>  years at 95% ci appears to be an over estimate than the age of haplogroup q  in literature <cit> . this probably has occurred due to the enhanced diversity, probably as an effect of population expansions and severe bottlenecks or might be due to later migrations and admixture. a further estimation of the age of y-hg q <dig> alone, using similar parameters, provided an age estimate of  <dig> . <dig>  years at 95% ci.

the compilation of distribution pattern of y-hg q in indian population  from the present study as well as from literature, points out that this hg is distributed widely, ranging from indo-european castes and tribes to their dravidian counterparts, despite its low frequency. these observations could be explained either on the basis of the ancestral relationship of different indian population groups, irrespective of linguistic and social divisions or alternatively by some degree of recent gene flow between these groups, not clear at the moment.

CONCLUSIONS
interestingly, apart from assigned y-hg q <dig>  samples and the only one individual representing q <dig> lineage, there were y-hg q bearing  samples, representing none of the known q subgroups and designated as q*. it was quite interesting to observe y-hg q in indian subcontinent though in low frequency but with ancestral q* state and a novel sub-branch q <dig> not reported elsewhere. a novel subgroup q <dig> was identified recently which is also restricted to indian subcontinent  <cit> . the most plausible explanation for these observations could be an ancestral migration of individuals bearing ancestral lineage q* to indian subcontinent with an autochthonous differentiation to q <dig> and q <dig> sublineages later on. however, other explanations of either the presence of both the sub haplogroups  in ancestral migrants or recent migrations from central asia, cannot be ruled out till the distribution and diversity of these subgroups is explored extensively in central asia and other regions. to conclude, this study presents a novel polymorphism, adding another sublineage q <dig> in the already existing arrangement of y-hg q in literature.
