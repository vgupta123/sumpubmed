BACKGROUND
staphylococcus. aureus  is a gram-positive bacterium, which causes a variety of suppurative infections and toxinoses in humans. the death rate associated with s. aureus infection is still high even with antimicrobial drug treatments due to the development of antibiotic resistance in methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus  strains. current developments in antimicrobial therapeutics show little efficacy in treating s. aureus and this bacterium remains a major human health threat. s. aureus, and in particular its cell wall, remain a major target of glycopeptide antibiotics and focus of bacteriology research.

teichoic acids, polymers of alternating phosphate and alditol groups, in addition to peptidoglycan are an essential component of bacterial cell walls. teichoic acid biosynthesis in s. aureus has not been well characterized. b. subtilis and s. aureus are both phylogenetically classified into bacillus/staphylococcus group. unlike that in s. aureus, the teichoic acid biogenesis in b. subtilis is well understood <cit> . there are two major types of cell wall teichoic acid in b. subtilis, poly  in strain  <dig>  <cit>  and poly  in strain w <dig>  <cit> . in strain  <dig>  the biosynthesis of teichoic acid poly involves genes taga, tagb, tagd, tage, and tagf. these tag genes are organized in a divergon of two divergently transcribed operons, tagab and tagdef <cit> . in w <dig>  the biosynthesis of teichoic acids poly involves genes tara, tarb, tard, tarf, tari, tarj, tark and tarl. the tar genes, similar to the tag genes, are also organized in a divergon, tagab-tagdef  <cit> . the biogenesis of essential wall teichoic acid in b. subtilis differs in these two strains, yet still shares similar enzymatic steps. functions of tagb, tagd, tagf were identified biochemically  <cit> . based on high sequence similarity, tara, tarb, tard, and tarf are believed to perform similar enzymatic reactions as taga, tagb, tagd, and tagf do respectively  <cit> , while tari, tarj, tark and tarl carry functions specific to poly teichoic acid biosynthesis  <cit> .

it has been reported that s. aureus h contains ribitol in its cell wall as does b. subtilis w <dig>  <cit> . it has also been shown that a tard like enzyme exists in s. aureus with catalytic characteristics different from b. subtilis tagd  <cit> . these studies suggest poly could be one of the cell wall teichoic acids in some s. aureus strains, yet this has not been unequivocally demonstrated.

recently the genomes of mrsa strains mu <dig>  mw <dig>  n <dig>  mrsa <dig>  and col as well as methicillin susceptible strain mssa <dig> have been sequenced  <cit> . the available sequence information enables us to take a comparative genomics approach to study the genomic requirements of wall teichoic acid in s. aureus by comparing them to the genes involved in b. subtilis teichoic acid synthesis.

we took all b. subtilis tar and tag genes, computationally to identify all orthologous genes supposedly involved in wall teichoic acid biogenesis in the s. aureus strains mu <dig>  mw <dig>  n <dig>  mrsa <dig>  mssa <dig> and col. our results suggest that poly, rather than poly, is the major teichoic acid in these strains. we also report the genomic organization of the teichoic acid biogenesis genes, which is different from the divergon organization in b. subtilis w <dig> and  <dig> 

RESULTS
identify genes involved in wall teichoic acid synthesis in s. aureus through comparative genomics analysis
in order to identify the genes concerned with wall teichoic acids synthesis in s. aureus, strains mu <dig>  mw <dig>  n <dig>  mrsa <dig>  mssa <dig> and col, amino acid sequences of all tar genes in b. subtilis w <dig> strain and tag genes in b. subtilis  <dig> strain from genbank were blasted against the refseq orfs of mu <dig>  mw <dig>  n <dig>  mrsa <dig>  mssa <dig> and col. significant hits were identified , and further subjected to phylogenetic analysis. the analysis led to the identification of the corresponding tar or tag orthologs in the s. aureus strains we examined. "ortholog" here is technically defined as those with the best phylogenetic similarity. by deleting branches of less homologous hits, the trees in figure  <dig> were generated, indicating the orthologous tar or tag genes in those s. aureus strains. tarb, tarf, tarl, tark from b. subtilis w <dig> and tagb, tagf from b. subtilis  <dig> share common blast hits in these s. aureus strains. we grouped these genes as well as their blast hits together to perform the phylogenetic analysis and built an integral tree  to show their respective orthologous relationship.

interestingly, these s. aureus orthologs, identified by phylogenetic analysis, shown in figure  <dig>  are actually the best blast hits .  we took the s. aureus orfs  and blasted them back against b. subtilis strain  <dig> orfs. their corresponding tag genes were also identified as the best blast hits . the reverse blast was not performed for w <dig> strain since its genome sequence is not currently available. the reverse best blast hit analysis was in agreement with phylogenetic clustering in identifying the orthologous genes involved in wall teichoic acid synthesis in examined s. aureus strains . the orthologous relationship is also summarized in table  <dig>  we further performed dot-blot analysis, which also support the identified corresponding orthologous relationships .

s. aureus contains tarf instead of tagf
the protein alignment of s. aureus tagf/tarf orthologs with b. subtilis tagf and tarf  shows that tagf/tarf orthologs in these s. aureus strains are fully aligned with the w <dig> tarf in length, and also like w <dig> tarf, are about only half the size of  <dig> tagf. and only the c-terminal part of the larger tagf is significantly homologous to tarf <cit> .

in b. subtilis, despite sharing 60% identity, the size difference between tarf and tagf implies a functional difference. tagf and tarf both use cdp-glycerol as a substrate but do not carry out identical functions. in strain w <dig>  tarf is likely to be responsible for the addition of the second glycerol-phosphate which completes the linkage unit process. while in  <dig>  tagf polymerizes the complete glycerol-phosphate chain onto the first residue  <cit> , which requires a bigger protein. thus the size difference correlates with their functional difference between tagf and tarf. the size difference between tagf and tarf may also be used to differentiate tar or tag pathway in teichoic acid synthesis  <cit> .

in the analyzed s. aureus strains, the size of tagf/tarf orthologs suggests the existence of tarf like function rather than tagf like function, and additional enzymes are required to complete teichoic acid synthesis <cit> .

s. aureus utilize tar pathway instead of tag pathway for teichoic acid biosynthesis
in b. subtilis strain w <dig>  tari, tarj. tark and tarl are specific to tar pathway, which are responsible for the synthesis of rbop and the addition of poly to the linkage unit  <cit>  and are absent in strain 168's tag pathway. the identification of tari, tarj and tarl orthologs  and the tarf kind of function  strongly suggest that the tar rather than the tag pathway is employed for cell wall teichoic acid synthesis in analyzed s. aureus strains. in the rest of the paper, these s. aureus wall teichoic acid synthesis genes are all referred as tar genes .

there are two copies for each tar j, tari and tarl gene in those s. aureus strains . interestingly, the tark ortholog is missing from the analyzed s. aureus strains. in w <dig>  tark and tarl are identified to catalyze a similar function, but tarl could take a bigger substrate enzymatically )  <cit> . thus the absence of tark ortholog in s. aureus could either mean it is functionally replaced by one of the two tarl or be compensated for by the extra copy of tarl.

identifying the correct full length tarb in s. aureus mu <dig> and n315
according to multiple sequence alignment analysis and blast analysis of b. subtilis tarb/tagb  with the corresponding s. aureus orthologs, the tarb orfs in mu <dig> and n <dig> were found to be notably shorter than b. subtilis tarb/tagb. they were also shown to lack half of the amino acid residues from the n-terminal of b.subtilis tarb/tagb . one would expect that the translation start site would be further upstream in both strains. the orf prediction was thus rerun on this genomic region , and the correct tarb/tagb in mu <dig> and n <dig> were identified . the correct tarb in n <dig> is from  <dig> to  <dig>  producing an orf of  <dig> amino acids; the correct tarb in mu <dig> is located between  <dig> and  <dig>  also encoding an orf of  <dig> amino acids. both two new tarb orfs were subsequently confirmed by a tblastn analysis against these two genomes with b. subtilis tarb as query. the new tarb orfs in mu <dig> and n <dig> strains and their alignment with the original incorrectly predicted ones are shown in figure 3a.

genomic organization of tar genes and duplication of tari, tarj and tarl in s. aureus strains
in b. subtilis, the wall teichoic acid synthesis genes are organized into a divergon, tarabijkl-tardf in w <dig> and tagab-tagdef in  <dig> . however, in s. aureus, the tar genes seem are rather organized by genomic distance as tarijl-tarf-tarijl-tara-tarb-tard in cis orientation . this genomic organization is conserved in all six analyzed s. aureus strains.

as shown above, blastp and phylogenetic analysis identify two copies of tari, tarj and tarl in each analyzed s. aureus strain, which are clustered into two tarijl regions with the same gene order. alignment and dot blot analysis of these two tarijl regions in each s. aureus strain confirm this gene duplication . the relevant genomic sequences of tarijl regions including the intergenic regions among i, j, k genes and the upstream  <dig> bp were used as an input for dotmatcher program to perform dot-blot analysis of the two tarijl regions . we also ran the ncbi blast2seq program to align the two regions . these analyses further confirmed the homology between those two tarijl regions, which strongly suggests the whole tarijl region is duplicated. the high homology indicates the duplication should not be an evolutionary  distal event. why and how this gene duplication occurred is still a question that remains to be answered.

the dot blot analysis also demonstrated that a small section of the c-terminal of tarj is not very conserved in the two copies of tarj. the enzymatic implication of this is not yet clear. similarly, the n-terminal of tarl  is neither homologous between the two tarl genes. it implies that one of the tarl is very likely to be the missing tark.

discussion
to understand the biosynthesis of cell wall teichoic acid in s. aureus strains mu <dig>  mw <dig>  n <dig>  mrsa <dig>  mssa <dig> and col, we took a bioinformatics approach to perform a comparative genomics analysis., we used the b. subtilis teichoic acid synthesis pathway as the base for comparison and identified all the genes essential to teichoic acid synthesis in these six s. aureus strains. besides tara/taga, tarb/tagb, and tard/tagd like genes, we identified tarf rather than tagf like gene and tar specific genes tari, tarj and tarl. the latter three ones are duplicated in these s. aureus strains.

in b. subtilis, tara, tarb, tard and tarf in w <dig> are the most similar to their counterparts in strain 168: taga, tagb, tagd and tagf  <cit> , whose functions in wall techoic acid synthesis are well understood  <cit> . since tarf does not carry out a polymerization function as tagf does, w <dig> tar pathways requires tari, tarj, tark and tarl to add poly to the linkage unit to complete teichoic acid synthesis  <cit> . the identification of tarf like function and tari, tarj, tarl like genes strongly support the fact that the analyzed s. aureus strains use a tar like pathway and poly is their major cell wall teichoic acids. this conclusion is consistent with the observations that a tard rather than tagd like catalytic mechanism presentin s. aureus  <cit>  and the identification of ribitol teichioc acid in the cell wall of s. aureus h  <cit> .

the tari, tarj and tarl in the six analyzed s. aureus strains are duplicated. compared to the w <dig> tar pathway, tark is absent in the six s. aureus strains. based on the proposed function of tark and tarl  <cit> , we suggest that tark is functionally redundant with one of the tarl in s. aureus or compensated by the duplication of tarl. figure  <dig> schematically describes the tar pathway in the analyzed s. aureus strains. compared to the proposed tar pathway in b. subtilis w <dig>   <cit> , the tark in w <dig> could be replaced by one of the s. aureus tarl, or the tark and tarl steps in w <dig> are actually merged as one tarl step in s. aureus . table  <dig> lists the putative enzymatic functions for s. aureus tar genes based on the swissprot annotation of b. subtilis w <dig> tar genes. in this report, we also identified the correct orfs for tarb in s. aureus strains n <dig> and mu <dig>  which are actually longer than the original orfs in genbank.

the genomic organizations of tar genes in s. aureus are quite different from b. subtilis. they are organized into several clusters in cis rather than the divergon in b. subtilis, and may be subjected to different regulatory mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
as we analyzed, tar  is the main teichoic acid biogenesis pathway in the s. aureus strains. and, the tar genes are organized into several genomic groups in cis and the genes specific to tar : tari, tarj, tarl are duplicated. the genomic organization of the s. aureus tar pathway suggests their regulations are different when compared to b. subtilis tar or tag pathway, which are grouped in two operons in a divergon structure.
