BACKGROUND
genomics is providing insights to the nature of and interactions among elements within genomes. furthermore, because the genome provides the platform for evolution, insights from genomics should yield insights to evolution. information goes the other way as well: evolutionary changes reflect the workings of the genome and so can be used to help understand the genome.

this understanding has motivated diverse approaches to the use of evolution to discover genome interactions. one approach is to compare natural patterns of molecular co-evolution between genes of the same genome: interacting elements are expected to show correlated rates of evolution  <cit> . another approach is more direct: engineer a genomic defect, experimentally evolve the genome to higher fitness, and observe the genetic basis of its recovery. the mutations that 'compensate' for the defect should map on the interacting partners of the defective element, in the local network of the affected gene. one implementation of this second approach, long used in genetics, is to study mutations that single-handedly rescue a lethal mutation, known as second-site suppressors. a more encompassing version of this evolutionary approach involves an extended experimental adaptation of a defective genome and identification of the full spectrum of compensatory changes. a defective gene may be rescued either by mutations in the elements interacting with it or by mutations that restore the lost function,  <cit>  but only the first of these will reveal the interactions.

here we test that perspective with an engineered deletion of the dna ligase gene in the bacteriophage t <dig>  this phage encodes at least  <dig> other proteins with major functions in dna metabolism: dna polymerase, endonuclease, exonuclease, ssdna binding protein, and the overlapping, in-frame helicase and primase  <cit> . the phage rna polymerase and an inhibitor of host dgtpase have minor roles in phage dna metabolism. gp <dig>  may also have a role in dna metabolism based on homology to a subunit of e. coli dna polymerase  <cit> . our expectation is that most compensatory changes in response to ligase deletion, and especially the important ones, will reside in the dna metabolism network. ligase has no known physical interactions with other dna metabolism proteins, so effects of its absence on the network are largely functional. yet, quantitative knowledge of these functional interactions is primitive and does not readily assist in predicting which genes will be most affected by the deletion of ligase, except perhaps endonuclease  <cit> .

the study here parallels one of t <dig>  <cit> , a relative of t <dig>  both genomes are approximately  <dig> kb dsdna with a common set of essential genes and most non-essential genes in the same gene order; nucleotide divergence between them is about 25%  <cit> . compensatory evolution in t <dig> deleted for its ligase gene resided largely within the dna metabolism network, although some changes were in genes or elements of unknown function. thus replication of the study with t <dig> tests the robustness of the 'network' model of compensatory evolution and also reveals whether the locations of compensatory changes are conserved.

RESULTS
two lines of t <dig> deleted for ligase were adapted for rapid growth . the host used was itself ligase-defective to magnify the fitness impact of the phage deletion. final fitnesses of both t3Δ <dig>  adaptations improved over initial fitnesses but were still well below that of a control, wild-type t <dig> adaptation with ligase gene intact . initial fitnesses of the two lines differed substantially, the basis of which will be addressed below.

the fitness improvements should reflect underlying genomic changes, but those changes could either be compensatory for the ligase deletion or could be generally beneficial by augmenting growth under the passage conditions. based on our recombination-based assessment of compensatory evolution , each line accumulated slightly more than a dozen compensatory mutations, spread across at least  <dig> genes and other genetic elements . in addition, three mutations of general benefit were observed in one line, none in the other, and one mutation of ambiguous compensatory status was observed in each line . the consensus sequence of t3Δ <dig> ae also revealed four mutations polymorphic over wild-type that were not near fixation and thus of such possibly weak benefit as to defy resolution in our compensatory assay .

our primary interest is the nature of the strictly compensatory changes – whether they reside within or outside of the dna metabolism network. biochemical and other phenotypic effects of mutations are not addressed, just their locations.

compensatory evolution in the dna metabolism network
both adapted t3Δ <dig>  lines experienced compensatory changes in 3– <dig> genes of the dna metabolism network . endonuclease and the overlapping helicase/primase genes were the only ones compensating in both t <dig> adaptations, but three other dna metabolism genes were involved in either of the adaptations. when the same gene experienced compensatory changes in both adaptations, the protein residues affected were not the same .

compensatory evolution in virion proteins
the t <dig> adaptations evolved several compensatory changes outside of dna metabolism . several changes occurred in genes encoding virion proteins with no known connection to dna metabolism. furthermore, the virion genes evolving in t3Δ <dig> ae tended to differ from those in t3Δ <dig> be. t3Δ <dig> ae was the more fully characterized, largely because it exhibited a surprising early evolution of changes.

t3Δ <dig> a <dig> had acquired five mutations before being exposed to the ligase-defective host . isolation of a deletion mutant involved  <dig> platings on a ligase-normal host before exposure to the ligase-defective host, during which time these mutations appeared . three of them resided in tail and tail fiber genes, whereas only one was in a gene involved in dna metabolism . the fifth change was a deletion in a gene of unknown function . one implication of this early evolution is that the a and b lines were no longer identical when first exposed to the ligase-defective host.

surprisingly, these early tail and tail fiber changes were compensatory for the ligase deletion. along with one other tail mutation that evolved later, they were even found to be collectively essential to the viability of the adapted t3Δ <dig> ae. specifically, a recombinant phage was constructed with its left end from the evolved t3Δ <dig> ae and the right end from the pre-adapted t3+e . this phage lacked all tail and tail fiber changes from the adaptation but retained all other changes from t3Δ <dig> ae. it could not form plaques on the ligase-defective host but could plaque on the ligase-normal host . why those tail and tail fiber changes should be essential on the ligase-defective host in a genome with several other compensatory changes is not clear, but the result indicates strong interactions among the compensatory changes.

the t3Δ <dig> b adaptation differed from the t3Δ <dig> a adaptation in three ways. first, t3Δ <dig> b <dig> had low fitness, less than zero. second, and undoubtedly related to the first point, t3Δ <dig> b <dig> acquired only one mutation during its isolation . third, t3Δ <dig> be did not acquire any tail changes, although it did acquire one compensatory tail fiber change.  in fact, outside of dna metabolism, there was little overlap in the suite of genes that acquired compensatory mutations in t3Δ <dig> be and t3Δ <dig> ae.

other compensatory evolution
in the t <dig> lines, some compensatory changes were in genes or elements with functions either outside both dna metabolism and virion components or with unknown functions . some changes can be interpreted as possibly regulatory, such as the substitution in the rnase iii site upstream of  <dig>  and the change in lysozyme . major and presumably destructive changes to gene  <dig>  were common to both t <dig> adaptations .

evolution on a ligase-normal host
the t3Δ <dig> b <dig> phage was adapted to the ligase-normal host . a profound effect of host ligase is evident from the fact that t3Δ <dig> b <dig> had a fitness of  <dig> doublings/hr higher on the ligase-normal host than on the ligase-defective host. nonetheless, t3Δ <dig> b <dig> fitness on the ligase-normal host improved by nearly  <dig> doublings/hr after adaptation. its genome was sequenced only selectively – over all dna metabolism genes and over some of the virion protein genes. surprisingly, the only change observed was in gene  <dig>  , a gene whose only known role is in adsorption. adaptation of t3Δ <dig> a <dig> to the ligase-normal host was not attempted .

t <dig> revisited
tail changes were not reported for the adaptation of t7Δ <dig>   <cit> , but the involvement of essential compensatory tail changes in the t3Δ <dig> a line led us to reconsider that outcome . the long-term t7Δ <dig>  line from rokyta et al. carried a change in tail b, but this mutation had arisen prior to the deletion and thus was not strictly compensatory . here, a short-term adaptation was conducted with an independently created t7Δ <dig>  genome. that line evolved a compensatory change in the tail a gene . thus involvement of virion proteins in compensatory evolution for a ligase deletion appears common to both t <dig> and t <dig> 

discussion
since the discovery of genes as discrete, physical units, one of the cornerstones of genetics has been that genes have distinct functions and thus functionally interact with limited sets of other genes. with the advent of genomics methods, this understanding has culminated in representations of genomes as connected networks of interacting parts . as our understanding of genomes improves, one truly exciting challenge is to discover how evolution maps onto the network and shapes it  <cit> .

we tested a simple model of the relationship between genome interactions and evolution: a defect within a network of interacting genes should favor compensating mutations in other genes of the network. bacteriophage t <dig> with a crippling deletion of the ligase gene was adapted to see whether compensatory changes would occur primarily in the phage's other dna metabolism genes. phage dna ligase is not essential in the presence of normal cellular ligase, but we used a host with impaired ligase, thus rendering phage ligase essential . ligase is not thought to physically contact the other genes in its network, merely interacting with them functionally to replicate dna. phage dna replication involves promiscuous pairing of strands between different molecules, and resolution of the consequent holiday junctions involves cutting the dna  and subsequent ligation of the ends. thus the functional interaction of ligase and endonuclease is strong  <cit> , but reduction of ligase activity is also expected to impact other processes in dna metabolism, at least indirectly.

there are two ways that a metabolic network can recover from the loss of a component: re-establish the function of the component or compensate for the loss of the function. several previous studies experimental studies of evolution in response to knockouts have observed re-establishment of function; examples include studies on networks involved in lactose metabolism in e. coli  <cit> , lysis in phage  <cit>  and phage host range  <cit> . here, re-establishment was unlikely because we removed a gene with unique activity. as a result we were able to investigate how a genome compensates for the loss of a function by altering other steps in a metabolic pathway  <cit> . quantitative estimates of biochemical parameters do not exist for any of the steps in t <dig> dna metabolism, so the predictions and observations here address only qualitative properties of the compensatory evolution, i.e., the genes experiencing compensatory evolution.

two lines of t <dig> deleted for the ligase gene were adapted, fitness improved, and approximately a dozen compensatory substitutions were observed in each line. compensatory mutations in both lines included the dna metabolism network . all six remaining dna metabolism genes acquired compensatory mutations in one line or the other; however, only three of the six genes acquired mutations in both lines, and even when the same genes exhibited compensatory evolution in both lines, different protein residues were affected. thus, involvement of the dna metabolism network appears to be more consistent than involvement of individual genes or of specific protein residues. functional impacts of those mutations are not known, but parallel evolution at the gene level is most easily explained if it has similar phenotypic effects despite the lack of parallelism in the residues affected.

compensatory substitutions also occurred outside the dna metabolism network . common to both lines was an involvement of virion protein genes, the tail and tail fiber in one line, and the tail fiber, major capsid protein and an internal core protein in the other. furthermore, at least some of these extra-network changes had major fitness effects: tail changes were essential to viability in one line.

an earlier long-term adaptation of t <dig> carrying a ligase deletion parallels the t <dig> results in some interesting ways . foremost was the involvement of dna metabolism genes in t <dig>  the three dna metabolism genes that acquired compensatory mutations in both t <dig> adaptations  also acquired compensatory mutations in t <dig>  the importance of endonuclease changes in compensating for a ligase defect was anticipated by sadowski  <cit> , who noted that ligase and endonuclease provide opposing functions and thus need to be balanced with each other. thus changes in the level of one should be compensated by corresponding changes in the level of the other. there is no similar justification for anticipating the invariant compensatory evolution of helicase or primase any more than of other dna metabolism genes, however.

sequences were determined as a consensus of the phage population and compared to the published sequence of t <dig>  <cit> ; the relative abundance of a base had to exceed 10% of the total before it was considered real.

p – polymorphic

more interesting, perhaps, was the parallel evolution in t <dig> and t <dig> of compensatory mutations outside of the dna metabolism network. first, mutations that knocked out gene  <dig>  appeared in t <dig> and both lines of t <dig>  gene  <dig>  is a short protein  whose function is unknown. the protein has 33% similarity between t <dig> and t <dig> and hence is far less conserved than are most other genes common to these phages. despite this lack of sequence conservation, the parallel loss points to a conserved function, likely in a network  that is more conserved than the protein itself. second, a substitution in the rnase iii site upstream of  <dig>  appeared in t <dig> and in one line of t <dig>  this mutation points to common regulatory responses in the two phages, which is not surprising given their similarities in many regulatory elements. last, all adaptations acquired mutations in some component of the tail . in one of two adaptations, t <dig> evolved a compensatory change in a tail gene. thus, despite approximately 25% sequence divergence between t <dig> and t <dig>  some striking parallels exist in the evolutionary responses to ligase deletion, even in elements that are not known to be involved in dna metabolism.

it is difficult to explain why genes outside the recognized dna metabolism network were involved in compensatory evolution of the ligase deletion. one obvious possibility is that these genes actually do physically interact with ligase or other proteins involved in dna metabolism, but the interactions have escaped detection. for example, a systems analysis of dna damage response pathways in yeast revealed the involvement of many more genes than had been identified by less comprehensive methods  <cit> . furthermore, data on neofunctionalization of gene duplicates suggest that genes may often have cryptic secondary functions  <cit> . to address the possibility of cryptic interactions, a t <dig> was constructed to carry the t <dig> ligase gene instead of its own . if ligase was involved in unknown interactions, this exchange might be expected to lower fitness and select changes in the interacting genes, especially as the two proteins are only 67% similar. the exchange had only a small effect on fitness and only slight compensatory evolution was observed . these results do not support a wealth of important, hidden interactions for ligase.

a second explanation for the inclusion of genes outside dna metabolism is that the severe disruption caused by the ligase deletion impacts the entire phage genome network, and compensatory changes in this broader network are favored to coordinate the life cycle with the retarded dna replication. if so, lessening the initial impact of the ligase deletion might then be expected to limit the compensatory evolution to the dna network. even when grown on a ligase-normal host, the host ligase does not fully compensate for the absent phage ligase, possibly because expression level is optimized for the host, not the phage. yet, normal host ligase activity should decrease the impact of the ligase deletion. indeed the impact of the phage ligase deletion was much lower on a ligase-normal host than on a ligase-defective host, and adaptation on the ligase-normal host resulted in improved fitness. however, no compensatory mutations occurred in dna metabolism. thus, we have no promising models to account for the observed compensatory mutations outside of dna metabolism in response to the phage ligase deletion. it is perhaps worth noting that yeast-2-hybrid analyses also lead to many unexpected interactions; however, yeast-2-hybrid analyses are more prone to spurious technical artifacts than the method used here.

this work dovetails with emerging evidence that genomic evolution is often not confined to the local genetic network thought to control the affected phenotypes. in the yeast s. cervisiae, adaptation to high ethanol was accomplished through change in a component of global transcription that has no known direct interaction with ethanol tolerance  <cit> . genes whose expression changed did not group into any particular functional network. in another study, e. coli that were adapted to use glycerol as a carbon source acquired mutations both within and outside the glycerol metabolic pathway  <cit> . likewise, many mutations affecting human genetics diseases have defied a priori knowledge  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
a genome was engineered to destroy a gene with a single, well-defined function. experimental evolution was used to study how the genome would compensate, with a particular interest in whether the compensatory changes would occur in the network of partners that functionally interact with the missing gene. evolution did not recreate the missing function, but instead compensated the loss through changes in other genes. many of the compensatory changes were among the functional partners of the missing gene. however, many compensatory mutations were not among functional partners, and these have no obvious explanation, even following investigation with subsequent genetic manipulations and adaptations. along with a few other experimental evolution studies, this study finds that an a priori phenotypic challenge leads to a mix of plausible and enigmatic compensatory evolution. despite the appearance that genomes are organized into functional networks controlling defined phenotypes  <cit> , phenotype evolution often fails to map onto those networks in an obvious way  <cit> . studies that only look for changes within the candidate network are likely to find mutations, but they are also likely to miss important dimensions of adaptation. hence, they run the risk of circularity – observing only what is expected.

our study has illustrated a method for uncovering genomic interactions that is easily applied in an experimental setting, is comparative, and requires no a priori knowledge of interactions . discoveries made with this method should complement those of other methods  <cit> . the method uncovers interactions at a functional level and that do not require protein-protein contacts. these types of interactions will likely be important both in evolution and in the design of synthetic genomes of the future.
