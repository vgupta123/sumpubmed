BACKGROUND
mycoplasma genitalium is now recognized as a sexually transmitted pathogen  <cit> . in healthy young men and women, the prevalence of m. genitalium infection is approximately 1% and is between those of gonococcal  and chlamydia trachomatis  infections  <cit> . in men, m. genitalium is a recognized and important cause of non-gonococcal urethritis  <cit> . reproductive tract disease syndromes associated with m. genitalium infection in women include pelvic inflammatory disease  <cit>  and cervicitis  <cit> . limited serologic studies and detection of m. genitalium dna in cervical, endometrial and/or fallopian tube specimens from women with salpingitis  <cit>  have suggested that m. genitalium could also be a cause of tubal factor infertility  <cit>  independent of chlamydia trachomatis. importantly, the burden of m. genitalium at the cervical mucosa is positively correlated with human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  shedding  <cit>  but the cell types involved and the mechanisms of these associations remain unclear. select pro-inflammatory cytokines, including il- <dig>  have been associated with increased hiv- <dig> titers  <cit>  and up-regulate hiv- <dig> replication  <cit> . these findings indicate that m. genitalium infection may enhance acquisition or dissemination of other sexually transmitted infections and provide strong rationale for investigation into the host innate immune response.

the mucosal surfaces of the female reproductive tract provide a physical barrier against invading pathogens. importantly, these surfaces are adapted to constant antigenic stimulation from the normal polymicrobial flora but are concomitantly charged with recognition and response to pathogen exposure. following sexual transmission, m. genitalium and other pathogens make initial contact with epithelial cells  that play an important role in early activation of the innate response. ecs of the vagina and cervix express robust levels of toll-like receptor   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and cd <dig> with low levels of tlr <dig>   <dig> and 7– <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, both vaginal and cervical ecs recognize bacterial ligands via tlr2/ <dig> such as the macrophage-activating lipopeptide of mycoplasma fermentans  <cit> . although macrophages are not always resident in the vaginal lumen, they are distributed throughout the epithelial and sub-epithelial mucosa of the vagina and cervix and make up a significant proportion of the total immune cell population of the reproductive tract  <cit> . generally, macrophages recognize, phagocytose and destroy pathogenic bacteria  <cit>  and studies are needed to address directly the interaction of m. genitalium with human macrophages. specifically, it currently is unclear whether infection of reproductive tract ecs elicits chemokine secretion for recruitment of phagocytic cells to infected tissues resulting in inflammation.

lipoprotein-enriched detergent phase preparations from m. genitalium strain g <dig> have been reported to activate inflammatory cytokine secretion from a transformed monocytic cell line  <cit>  but these fractions have yet to be tested using human genital ecs or cell types more relevant to genital transmission. recently, our group has shown that human reproductive tract ecs are highly responsive to tlr2/6-activating regions of the mg309-encoded protein resulting in inflammatory cytokine secretion  <cit> . to further explore the responses of human genital ecs, we have established that m. genitalium inoculation of human vaginal, ecto- and endocervical ecs results in both extra- and intracellular infection that elicits tissue-specific cytokine secretion. the elaborated cytokines were consistent with recruitment of macrophages to the reproductive mucosa. in addition, subsequent testing showed that human monocyte-derived macrophages  rapidly phagocytosed and killed m. genitalium resulting in a robust secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. these data provide the first characterization of the human innate immune response to viable m. genitalium from relevant cell types of the female reproductive tract and provide insight into the dynamic interaction with the reproductive mucosa.

methods
human cell culture
immortalized human ecs derived from vaginal , ectocervical and endocervical tissues were maintained as described previously  <cit> . keratinocyte serum-free medium  supplemented with bovine pituitary extract , recombinant epidermal growth factor , cacl <dig> , penicillin-g  and streptomycin sulfate  was used for culture of ectocervical and endocervical ecs at 37°c in a 5% co <dig> humidified incubator  <cit> . vaginal ecs were maintained in a 1: <dig> mixture of ksfm and vec- <dig> media . me- <dig>  cervical carcinoma cells were maintained in rpmi  <dig>  medium supplemented with  <dig>  mm non-essential amino acids ,  <dig> mm l-glutamine, penicillin-g , streptomycin sulfate  and 10% fetal bovine serum . cells were verified to be free of any contaminating mycoplasmas by pcr .

propagation of m. genitalium strains g <dig> and m2300
mycoplasma genitalium type strain g <dig>  or the more contemporary, lower passage danish m <dig> strain was propagated in friis fb medium  <cit> . briefly, m. genitalium stocks  were inoculated aseptically into tightly sealed tissue culture flasks containing freshly prepared friis fb medium and incubated at 37°c for 5– <dig> d. growth was monitored by the formation of adherent microcolonies and a ph-mediated color change of the medium. m. genitalium was harvested from culture flasks by pouring off the spent medium, extensively washing adherent mycoplasmas with  <dig> volumes of approximately  <dig> ml each of sterile pbs and then scraping adherent microcolonies into fresh pbs. m. genitalium viability was quantified in 96-well plates by serial 10-fold dilution of each sample into fresh friis fb medium. the last dilution to show a change in color and formation of microcolonies was used to calculate the approximate number of viable organisms in the original sample. uv-inactivation  of m. genitalium was performed using a stratalinker  <dig>  to a total energy of  <dig>  microjoules/cm <dig>  heat denaturation of m. genitalium was accomplished by incubating log-phase cultures at 80°c for  <dig> min and then rapid cooling on ice. loss of viability was verified by an absence of growth in friis fb medium after 14d incubation at 37°c.

isolation of human monocyte-derived macrophages
human macrophages were generated as described previously  <cit>  from peripheral blood mononuclear cells  collected from healthy volunteers with university of texas medical branch institutional review board approval. briefly, pbmcs were isolated using hypaque-ficoll  density-gradient separation. selection was performed using the magnetic column separation system . purified monocytes were differentiated into macrophages by culturing in rpmi  <dig> medium supplemented with 10% fbs, l-glutamine, hepes, sodium pyruvate and gm- csf . following 7d of differentiation, monocyte-derived macrophages  were removed from the culture plastic using a non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution  and then resuspended in fresh rpmi  <dig> medium. macrophage differentiation was verified by flow cytometric confirmation of cd11b, cd <dig> and cd <dig> expression showing typical purities of >95% . macrophages were differentiated from pbmcs collected from  <dig> different blood donors and used in  <dig> independent experiments.

electron microscopy
i. transmission electron microscopy
adherent monolayers of m. genitalium-inoculated  or non-inoculated genital ecs or human mdm  were fixed at indicated times from 2– <dig> h post-infection  in a mixture of  <dig> % formaldehyde and  <dig> % glutaraldehyde in  <dig>  m cacodylate buffer  containing  <dig> % trinitrophenol and  <dig> % cacl <dig>  cells were scraped, centrifuged briefly at  <dig>  × g, washed in  <dig>  m cacodylate buffer  and then post-fixed in 1% oso <dig> in the same buffer. each sample was stained en bloc with 1% uranyl acetate in  <dig>  m maleate buffer, dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in poly/bed  <dig> epoxy resin . ultrathin sections were cut using the ultracut s ultramicrotome . sections were stained sequentially in 2% aqueous uranyl acetate and lead citrate and then examined in a philips  <dig> or cm  <dig> electron microscope at  <dig> kv.

ii. scanning electron microscopy
m. genitalium-infected and non-infected control cells were fixed as described above for transmission electron microscopy  for at least  <dig> h at room temperature, post-fixed in 1% oso <dig> in  <dig>  m cacodylate buffer, dehydrated in ethanol, treated with hexamethyldisalazane and then air dried. next, the coverslips were mounted on the specimen stubs and sputter coated with iridium for  <dig> sec in an emitech k575x turbo sputter coater . samples were examined in a hitachi s <dig> field emission scanning electron microscope  at  <dig> kv.

quantification of m. genitalium uptake by cervical epithelial cells
uptake of m. genitalium by reproductive tract ecs was assessed using the gentamicin invasion assay  <cit> . the sensitivity of m. genitalium strains g <dig> and m <dig> to gentamicin was established first by inoculation of log-phase organisms into friis fb medium with gentamicin concentrations ranging from 100– <dig> ug/ml. no m. genitalium growth was observed at  <dig> or  <dig> ug/ml therefore a working concentration of  <dig> ug/ml was employed in subsequent studies to minimize ec uptake of gentamicin and subsequent killing of intracellular m. genitalium. confirmatory studies were completed subsequently using  <dig> ug/ml gentamicin. as a representative genital ec type, me- <dig> cells were seeded into 96-well plates 1d prior to infection at a density of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/well. log-phase m. genitalium was inoculated onto me- <dig> cells  in triplicate. following  <dig> h incubation, when m. genitalium appeared to be attached to and invading genital ecs , the inoculum was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing gentamicin. at  <dig> min,  <dig> and  <dig> h following removal of the inoculum, culture supernatants were removed and the infected cells were washed 3× with sterile pbs. cells then were removed from the well by scraping into friis fb medium followed by plating serial 10-fold dilutions prepared in friis fb medium into a 96-well plate. outgrowth of m. genitalium from infected me- <dig> cells was observed for 14d. the load of viable m. genitalium from each sample was calculated by titration as described above.

the gentamicin invasion assay also was utilized to investigate whether intracellular m. genitalium were able to escape from the infected ecs. for these experiments, me- <dig> cervical ecs were infected with m. genitalium and then extracellular organisms were killed with gentamicin  after  <dig> h of infection as described above. infected ecs then were rinsed 3× with pbs and overlaid with fresh medium that did not contain gentamicin. at  <dig> min,  <dig> and  <dig> h following removal of the gentamicin, culture supernatants were collected for quantification of m. genitalium that had egressed from the infected cells. quantification was performed in triplicate experiments using the ccu assay as described above.

stimulation of genital epithelial cells or primary monocyte-derived macrophages
human vaginal, ectocervical or endocervical ecs were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/well. primary human mdm were seeded into 96-well plates at  <dig> × 104/well. following overnight incubation at 37°c, culture supernatants were removed and replaced with fresh medium to remove any constitutively secreted cytokines. log-phase m. genitalium g <dig> or m <dig> was harvested as described above, re-suspended in fresh pbs and then inoculated onto each cell type . controls for innate immune stimulation included the m. salivarium-derived tlr2/ <dig> agonist, fsl- <dig>  or an equal volume of the pbs vehicle added to triplicate wells and processed in parallel. secreted cytokines were quantified from culture supernatants  <dig> or  <dig> h pi via a cytometric bead array  assay using the human 27-plex panel of cytokine targets . for testing of m. genitalium viability following macrophage exposure, infected macrophages were inoculated into friis fb medium  <dig> min,  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> h pi and observed for m. genitalium outgrowth indicated by a ph-mediated color change and adherent microcolony formation.

statistical analyses
the student's t test was used to calculate significant differences in intra- and extracellular m. genitalium titers and when comparing secretion of individual cytokines from a single cell type to basal  levels. the one-way anova followed by dunnett's post-test  was used to calculate significant differences in cytokine secretion levels when more than  <dig> conditions were compared. significance was indicated when p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
m. genitalium ultrastructure, attachment and invasion of human genital epithelial cells
m. genitalium strain g <dig> or m <dig> grown to log phase in friis medium resulted in adherent microcolony formation and were characterized by a radial gradient of colony diameter . within each microcolony, m. genitalium organisms were densely packed and highly pleomorphic . several organisms were observed that showed a tip-like structure  for both the danish m <dig> strain  and g <dig> .

m. genitalium has been shown previously to occupy intracellular spaces in cultured cells of non-reproductive origin  <cit>  and cells obtained clinically from vaginal swabs of m. genitalium-positive women  <cit> . however, the invasion dynamics for genital cell types are not well understood. inoculation of genital ecs with m. genitalium strains g <dig> or m <dig>  resulted in attachment to vaginal  and cervical  ecs by  <dig> h pi. attachment of m. genitalium g <dig> and m <dig> to reproductive tract ecs was consistently characterized by a polarized electron-dense core, within the m. genitalium organism  <cit> , seen adjacent to the host cell membrane . this dense core was evident within some tip structures as shown for m <dig> . after  <dig> h infection, m. genitalium g <dig> were attached to the host cells  and also observed in intracellular vacuoles distributed throughout the cellular cytosol . in approximately 60% of examined cells, intracellular vacuoles were directly adjacent to the nucleus . similar findings were observed 6– <dig> h pi  for both the g <dig> and m <dig> strain. at these later time points, extracellular m. genitalium also were observed but were often in aggregates and showed no evidence of attachment or invasion of host cells. morphologically, the intracellular and extracellular mycoplasmas were highly pleomorphic and appeared to have normal ultrastructure indicated by a dense content of ribosomes and few degraded bacterial membranes. a previously described tip structure  <cit>  was observed readily on m. genitalium grown in friis fb medium  but an elongated tip structure was not always visible on mycoplasmas attached to host cells in each stained section. no similar organisms or structures were observed in non-infected cells processed in parallel.

we next quantified m. genitalium g <dig> and m <dig> viability from intra- and extracellular fractions of cultured me- <dig> cells using a gentamicin protection assay as described in the methods. to quantify intracellular titers, the m. genitalium inoculum was incubated for  <dig> h to allow attachment to and entry of host cells  followed by removal of the inoculum and replacement of fresh culture medium containing a bactericidal concentration of gentamicin . fifteen minutes following inoculation with either g <dig> or m <dig> , no viable m. genitalium were detected in the cells . using a color changing unit assay , high titers of viable intracellular m. genitalium were detected at both  <dig> h  and  <dig> h pi . no m. genitalium viability was detected in supernatants containing gentamicin at either point indicating that the observed titers were due exclusively to intracellular mycoplasmas that were protected from gentamicin exposure. extracellular m. genitalium titers, representing organisms that had escaped from infected cells, were quantified from separate wells using supernatants of infected cells. extracellular titers from culture supernatants  were significantly less than intracellular titers  at the tested time points . these data indicated that, after m. genitalium entry of the cell, more organisms remained inside the cell than egressed to the culture supernatant. intracellular localization of m. genitalium in vaginal and cervical ecs also was consistent with electron microscopic analyses .

m. genitalium elicited pro-inflammatory cytokines from genital epithelial cells
following demonstration of intracellular localization within reproductive tract ecs, we evaluated the host cytokine response from  <dig> human vaginal  and  <dig> cervical ec lines   <cit> . of the tested time points, peak cytokine values were obtained  <dig> h pi and are presented in table  <dig>  vaginal ecs exposed to viable m. genitalium g <dig> or m <dig>  responded with significant secretion of interleukin- <dig> , il- <dig> and gm-csf . following m. genitalium exposure, ectocervical ecs secreted significant levels of il- <dig> and il- <dig> . endocervical ecs responded to m. genitalium with the most number of secreted cytokines that included il- <dig>  il- <dig>  g-csf, gm-csf and mcp- <dig> . using il- <dig> secretion at  <dig> h pi as a comparator for all cell types, endocervical ecs were more responsive than vaginal or ectocervical cells when the fold increase of cytokine secretion by infected cells was calculated and compared to cells that received only pbs . a similar pattern of cytokine elaboration was observed following inoculation of m. genitalium at a moi of  <dig> . cytokines that were not significantly induced by m. genitalium g <dig> or m <dig> in any genital ec type included il1-b, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  mip1-a, mip1-b, basic fgf, eotaxin, ip- <dig>  pdgf-bb and veg-f. the pattern of cytokines elaborated from cervical ecs was consistent with monocyte and macrophage recruitment and thus we next evaluated the responses of primary human mdm to m. genitalium exposure and determined whether these cells were capable of m. genitalium phagocytosis and killing.

phagocytosis of m. genitalium by human monocyte-derived macrophages
to determine the susceptibility of m. genitalium to macrophage phagocytosis, human mdm were exposed to log-phase m. genitalium strains g <dig> or m <dig>  and processed at selected time points for tem. within  <dig> min of inoculation, m. genitalium appeared dark staining with a dense content of ribosomes and no signs of membrane degeneration . as early as  <dig> min pi, m. genitalium uptake by mdm was observed that was associated with morphologic changes of the bacterium including a loss of ribosome density and a hollow appearance  consistent with a loss of viability. internalized m. genitalium were prevalent and localized to membrane-bound phagolysosomes. similar morphological changes were observed  <dig> h pi . by  <dig> h pi, the macrophages appeared to have many phagocytic vesicles but no intracellular organisms could be located . viability of m. genitalium following macrophage exposure was evaluated by seeding infected mdm  into friis fb medium at 37°c. these cultures were observed for m. genitalium outgrowth by a ph-mediated color change and microcolony formation. no growth was detected over a 14d period from any of these cultures collectively indicating that m. genitalium was susceptible to rapid phagocytosis and killing.

m. genitalium elicited pro-inflammatory cytokines from human monocyte-derived macrophages
because m. genitalium was phagocytosed rapidly by human mdm with no evidence of bacterial viability by  <dig> h pi, we sought to determine whether m. genitalium exposure to human mdm would elicit acute-phase cytokine responses. viable m. genitalium g <dig> and m <dig> inoculated at moi  <dig> or moi  <dig> elicited significant cytokine elaboration from macrophage cultures measured from supernatants collected  <dig> h pi . no significant differences were observed between g <dig> and m <dig> . the profile of induced cytokine responses from human macrophages was composed predominately of early pro-inflammatory markers including significant secretion of il-1β, tnf-α, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  g-csf, ifn-γ, mcp- <dig>  mip-1α, mip-1β and rantes . these findings were consistent with results from  <dig> additional blood donors . following uv inactivation, m. genitalium elicited a similar profile and magnitude of cytokine secretion  indicating that the immunostimulatory capacity was not dependent upon bacterial viability. immune markers that were not induced by m. genitalium in human mdm included il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  basic fgf, eotaxin, ip- <dig>  pdgf-bb and veg-f. considering il- <dig>  a representative acute-phase cytokine with a central role in innate responses to bacterial pathogens  <cit> , heat denaturation or proteinase-k digestion of m. genitalium significantly reduced the inflammatory capacity from human macrophages  suggesting that a significant proportion of the inflammatory capacity was mediated by m. genitalium protein components.

a human mdm were inoculated with m. genitalium g <dig>  or an equal volume of the pbs vehicle as a control into triplicate wells. culture supernatants were collected  <dig> h pi to quantify secreted cytokines as described in the methods. values are expressed as the mean ± sem pg/ml supernatant. pbs values are presented to indicate basal cytokine elaboration. data collected following exposure to m. genitalium strain m <dig> were similar in pattern and magnitude. nd, not detected. *, p <  <dig>  using anova.

discussion
considering that m. genitalium reproductive tract infections in humans  <cit>  and non-human primates  <cit>  are often persistent, it seems likely that m. genitalium employs some tactic to elude the host response to establish infection. consistent with this hypothesis, attachment to and invasion of vaginal and cervical ecs by m. genitalium strains g <dig> and m <dig> was observed by a subset of organisms as early as  <dig> h pi  suggesting that intracellular localization could provide a survival niche. the intracellular m. genitalium organisms were found in intracellular vacuoles similar in appearance to those seen in cultured vero  <cit> , hela and em <dig> cells  <cit> . approximately 60% of m. genitalium-containing vacuoles were adjacent to the nucleus but also were distributed throughout the cytoplasm similar to a previous observation in cultured human endometrial cells  <cit> . considering more than  <dig> h of microscope time and over  <dig> examined grids, it was concluded that more than 95% of cells showed attached m. genitalium organisms with roughly 50% of cells containing intracellular vacuoles with m. genitalium collected 0– <dig> h pi. importantly, no m. genitalium organisms were ever observed free in the cytosol but were always bounded by a vacuolar membrane.

our findings are the first report of intracellular localization in cultured human ecs from the vagina, ecto- and endocervix. these cell types are likely the first target cells following sexual transmission and therefore acute-phase interaction and host response are vital to understanding how m. genitalium establishes reproductive tract infection. the observation of m. genitalium invasion of vaginal and cervical ecs  is consistent with the clinical observation of heavy intracellular m. genitalium loads in pcr-positive vaginal specimens  <cit>  and is substantiated by earlier reports of intracellular localization in cells of non-reproductive tract origin  <cit> . from our gentamicin invasion studies, m. genitalium was found both at intracellular sites and in extracellular fractions of infected cells. these outcomes were consistent with our electron microscopy studies as well. however, additional investigation will be required to address intracellular m. genitalium replication within host reproductive tract ecs as the experimental systems utilized for our studies did not facilitate reliable quantification of this outcome. interestingly, it also was observed that, following intracellular localization by m. genitalium, a low level of egress from infected cells occurred  from 5– <dig> h pi suggesting that periodic egress from infected cells could result in cell to cell spread. collectively, these results firmly indicate m. genitalium's capacity for invasion and prolonged intracellular survival that could provide the organism with a long-term survival niche in reproductive tract tissues.

from our studies of vaginal and cervical ecs, m. genitalium was observed at both intracellular and extracellular sites. however, it is not clear whether the invasive organisms are genetically different than those that were observed outside of the cells or whether some unknown factor facilitates entry of some organisms while excluding others. in addition, a well-defined tip structure  <cit>  was rarely observed in our studies despite robust attachment to and invasion of the vaginal and cervical ecs  used in these studies. an area of increased electron density was observed within the m. genitalium organism  adjacent to the host cell surface presumably involved in attachment to the host cell. a similar structure has been described previously for m. genitalium strains grown attached to plastic cultureware  <cit> . these phenomena suggest that m. genitalium attachment to and invasion of reproductive tract ecs may not require a well-defined tip structure. in addition, attachment and invasion may involve cellular receptors that are localized to specific membrane sites that are better modeled using polarized 3-dimensional ec cultures. indeed, the observed egress of m. genitalium from infected mucosal ecs likely would lead to infection of an adjacent cells in vivo rather than into the culture supernatant of traditional 2-dimensional cultures. this considered, a 3-dimensional multi-layer model of vaginal ec infection might better address how m. genitalium interacts with the host mucosa and establishes primary reproductive tract infection.

because ecs likely serve as the first responders to sti, we investigated the acute-phase cytokine response to m. genitalium from human vaginal and cervical ecs. we found that m. genitalium elicited minimal innate responses from human vaginal ecs from  <dig> donors but ecto- and endocervical ecs were highly responsive and secreted cytokines consistent with recruitment of immune cells including il- <dig>  g-csf, gm-csf and mcp- <dig> . the increased responsiveness of endocervical ecs may have biological relevance, as the normally sterile upper tract tissues likely are more sensitive to microbial contamination than the lower genital tract. paradoxically, it is in the upper tract tissues where inflammation due to microbial infection likely has the most severe consequences potentially leading to pid, salpingitis or reduced fertility  <cit> . our studies were focused primarily on the lower genital tract but the heightened sensitivity of endocervical ecs provides rationale for testing cell types of the upper tract including endometrial  <cit>  and fallopian ecs. all of the cell types used for cytokine analysis were immortalized by transduction of the human papilloma virus e6/e <dig> genes known to reduce the levels, but preserve the pattern of cytokine secretion relative to primary progenitor cells  <cit> . therefore, we are confident that the observed cytokine inductions indicate the character of the responses but likely underestimate the actual levels of secretion.

considering the profile of secreted cytokines by m. genitalium-infected reproductive ecs, we next investigated whether macrophages could play a role in the cellular immune response to m. genitalium. following exposure to human mdm, phagocytosis of m. genitalium occurred rapidly  resulting in complete ablation of bacterial viability by  <dig> h pi. importantly, several key pro-inflammatory cytokines were induced in response to m. genitalium exposure. il- <dig> secretion may be of particular importance considering that il- <dig> from vaginal secretions is positively correlated with hiv- <dig> burden  <cit>  and known to up-regulate hiv- <dig> replication  <cit> . indeed, the microbial burden of m. genitalium in clinically-obtained cervical specimens also is strongly associated with hiv- <dig> shedding  <cit> . furthermore, macrophages are one of two major cellular reservoirs for latent hiv- <dig> infection and contribute to early-stage virus transmission and dissemination throughout the host . to this end, we observed significant secretion of  <dig> potent chemokines responsible for granulocyte recruitment, mip1-a, mip1-b  <cit> , mcp- <dig> and rantes  <cit>   indicating that macrophage exposure to m. genitalium in reproductive tissues likely would result in significant inflammation consistent with enhanced hiv- <dig> replication. our findings suggest that both infected genital ecs and recruited immune cells are responsible for secretion of il- <dig> and other cytokines that may contribute to hiv- <dig> pathogenesis but continued research is necessary to dissect the cellular dynamics of hiv- <dig> and m. genitalium co-infections.

in our studies, the macrophage-stimulatory capacity of m. genitalium was not dependent upon bacterial viability. this outcome likely is due to the highly sensitive nature of macrophages. however, both heat denaturation and proteinase-k digestion significantly reduced the cytokine response  suggesting that a large proportion of m. genitalium's inflammatory capacity is indeed mediated by protein components. in addition, other findings from our group showed that m. genitalium and the antigenic mg309-encoded protein activate tlr2/ <dig> to induce pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion from human mdm and reproductive tract ecs  <cit> . collectively, these results indicated that macrophages are highly sensitive to m. genitalium exposure and highlight the putative pressure to evade the cellular immune responses.

establishment of primary infection and persistence by m. genitalium in host tissues is not well understood. our findings suggest that a subset of m. genitalium organisms rapidly invade host ecs thereby exploiting an intracellular survival niche to evade the potent and effective cellular host immune responses. studies that address directly whether reproductive ecs provide protection from macrophage phagocytosis are currently underway and will be essential to understand this mechanism of immune evasion. importantly, m. genitalium infection resulted in acute-phase inflammatory cytokine responses from vaginal and cervical ecs. therefore, it is possible that persistent infection of female reproductive tract tissues may indeed result in inflammatory outcomes that could affect reproductive health but continued research is necessary to fully elucidate the mechanisms of m. genitalium-induced urogenital disease in women.

CONCLUSIONS
human vaginal, ecto- and endocervical ecs were susceptible to m. genitalium g <dig> and m <dig> infection resulting in rapid intracellular localization of a subset of organisms and significant secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. the pattern of cytokine secretion was consistent with recruitment and stimulation of monocytes and macrophages at the vaginal and cervical mucosa. following exposure to human monocyte-derived macrophages, m. genitalium was killed rapidly and elicited a potent pro-inflammatory response including secretion of cytokines associated with enhanced hiv- <dig> replication. these are the first data showing that cultured human vaginal and cervical ecs are susceptible and immunologically responsive to m. genitalium infection likely inducing cellular immune responses to infected tissues. continued investigation of whether intracellular localization in reproductive tract ecs provides protection from the cellular immune response is warranted but rapid invasion of vaginal ecs, combined with the low immunological response, provides evidence for how m. genitalium might efficiently establish reproductive tract infection.
