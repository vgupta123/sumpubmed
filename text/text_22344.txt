BACKGROUND
campylobacter jejuni is now well established as the leading cause of bacterial food-borne gastroenteritis worldwide  <cit> . infection symptoms vary in severity and may include nausea, severe or bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping and fever  <cit> . c. jejuni infection is usually self-limiting, but in some cases may progress to the debilitating, polyneuropathic disorders guillain-barré syndrome  or the oculomotor variant miller fisher syndrome   <cit> . importantly, c. jejuni is the commonest antecedent infection in these neuropathies and expression of carbohydrate epitopes mimicking host gangliosides is considered a prerequisite for neuropathy development since such mimicry can induce pathogenic, cross-reactive antibodies  <cit> . gangliosides are glycosphingolipids occurring in high concentration in the peripheral nervous system, particularly in the nerve axon  <cit> . a humoural response against these glycolipids  plays a central role in gbs and mfs development  <cit> . mimicry of the saccharide component of gangliosides within the outer core of c. jejuni lipooligosaccharides  is well documented  <cit> . supporting a pathogenic role of c. jejuni in gbs, c. jejuni los-induced anti-gm <dig> ganglioside antibodies react at the nodes of ranvier, where the axon is exposed in the nerve fibre  <cit> , resembling the pathology observed in gbs patients, and inoculation of c. jejuni gm1-mimicking los has been reported to induce gbs-like symptoms in a rabbit model  <cit> .

c. jejuni is capable of growth at temperatures ranging from  <dig> to 47°c and therefore is capable of growth at the body temperatures of human and avian hosts,  <dig> and 42°c, respectively  <cit> . different temperature environments may trigger events to accommodate the colonization, commensalism, pathogenesis or dormancy of this bacterium. over  <dig> genes have been reported to be differentially expressed at 37°c compared to 42°c, including the gale and wlae genes found in the los biosynthesis locus  <cit> . moreover, los is an important pathogenic factor of c. jejuni. arising from this, it is possible that c. jejuni los expression is affected by temperature, whether it is by variable gene expression or at the enzymatic activity level. although mimicry of gangliosides by c. jejuni los has been extensively studied structurally over the last two decades  <cit> , it is important to note that these previous characterization studies have been performed on strains grown at 37°c.

the human isolate c. jejuni nctc  <dig> has been a basis for studying this bacterial species since the late 1970s. the sequencing and annotation of its genome was published by the sanger centre  <cit> . a later study revealed that the genome-sequenced strain of c. jejuni nctc  <dig>  is a poor colonizer of  <dig> day-old chicks and showed that this variant had an altered morphology and a different transcriptional profile compared with the original nctc  <dig> isolate   <cit> . recurrent passaging of c. jejuni 11168-o in laboratory conditions was considered responsible for this variation.

to date, a number of genes from the los biosynthesis cluster of c. jejuni nctc  <dig>  have been characterized  <cit>  and the structures of the lipid a and saccharide components of the los have been reported  <cit> . the los outer core mimics the oligosaccharide  region of gm <dig> ganglioside  <cit>  and is likely to be capable of switching from a gm1-like epitope to a gm2-like epitope as a result of phase variation  <cit> .

the lack of knowledge of the structure of c. jejuni los at 42°c compared to 37°c prompted us to examine the effect of incubation temperature on the phenotypic variation of los, including the mimicry of gangliosides, in c. jejuni 11168-gs and 11168-o. variation in los structure was assessed by electrophoretic analysis and immunoblotting and confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy. carbohydrate epitopes produced by both strains were assessed for ganglioside mimicry using various anti-ganglioside ligands  as probes. in addition, los structural variation at these two incubation temperatures was examined in minimally subcultured c. jejuni isolates from humans and chickens. importantly, notable differences were observed in the relative production by c. jejuni of varying size and ganglioside mimicries at 37°c and 42°c.

RESULTS
electrophoretic analysis of c. jejuni los preparations
mini-preparations of los isolated from c. jejuni 11168-gs and 11168-o strains grown at 37°c and 42°c were examined using sodium dodecyl suphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  analysis. the los from c. jejuni 11168-o and 11168-gs strains resolved into two distinct forms, referred to from here on as higher-mr and lower-mr los . two control los with a known size  from m. catarrhalis serotype a  were used for relative sizing of c. jejuni los. the first was wild-type los and resolved on the sds-page with the lower band at ~ <dig> kda . the second was a los from a lgt <dig> mutant  of m. catarrhalis  <dig>  lacking one glucose and resolved at ~ <dig> kda  <cit>  . therefore, the difference of one hexose unit corresponded to a relative migration of ~ <dig> kda. accordingly, these controls were used to compare the sizes of the c. jejuni los forms . the higher-mr form of c. jejuni los resolved at approximately  <dig> kda , whereas the lower-mr form, which has not been previously reported, was observed at ~ <dig> kda. figure 1b shows that c. jejuni 11168-o  and 11168-gs  have a greater amount of the  <dig> kda los form at 42°c, than at 37°c. for both 11168-o and -gs at 42°c the amount of los produced appears greater than at 37°c, both in terms of quantity of the  <dig> kda form and the  <dig> kda form. densitometry analysis revealed that for 11168-o at 37°c   <dig> % of the total los produced was the  <dig> kda form and  <dig> % was the  <dig> kda form. in contrast, at 42°c  <dig> % of total los produced was the  <dig> kda form and  <dig> % was the  <dig> kda form. similar results were observed for 11168-gs variant. these results were confirmed using purified los preparations from c. jejuni 11168-o and 11168-gs, which gave identical electrophoretic profiles  as those of the los mini-preparations. also, the total amount of protein isolated from the same cell populations of c. jejuni 11168-o and c. jejuni 11168-gs were unaffected by the change of growth temperature , thus allowing normalisation of cell samples prior to proteinase k digestion to produce los mini-preparations for comparison. in contrast to los, the cps profiles from the same populations were unaffected by change of growth temperature .

the los of the wild-type human isolate c. jejuni  <dig> was analysed identically  to determine whether the temperature-related phenomenon was unique to c. jejuni nctc  <dig>  the los of strain  <dig> was found also to separate into the two distinct forms; the higher-mr and lower-mr los form. the relative los form profile of c. jejuni  <dig> was also noted to be affected by growth temperature , whereby a slightly greater amount of the lower-mr los was produced at 42°c .

nmr spectroscopic analysis of the higher-mr and lower-mr los form of c. jejuni  <dig> at 42°c
analysis of the os isolated from c. jejuni 11168-o at 37°c with 1d nmr gave spectra  consistent with the previously published structure of c. jejuni nctc  <dig>  <cit>  . given that the previous structural studies of c. jejuni nctc  <dig> core os  <cit>  had been performed on bacteria grown at 37°c it was of interest to investigate the differences in the core os structure that were observed at 42°c. to this end, bacteria were grown at 42°c, the los extracted and purified, and the core os acid-liberated. examination of the 31p spectrum of the os so obtained, showed a single 31p peak at ~ <dig> ppm, and which was confirmed from a heteronuclear single quantum coherence -total correlation spectroscopy  spectrum to be a phosphorylethanolamine  residue. doubling up of the anomeric line of the signal attributed substitution to the → <dig> ,6)-l-α-d-hep-  which is probably due to some heterogeneity in the phosphorylation of the heptose . signals consistent with α-linked n-acetylneuraminic acid , and n-acetylgalactosamine  were also noted. furthermore, the anomeric region of the hsqc spectrum revealed the presence of nine anomeric signals, in addition to the α-neu5ac. taken together, these spectra were consistent with the previously published structure of c. jejuni nctc  <dig> grown at 37°c  <cit>  as shown in figure  <dig>  nevertheless, examination of the nmr spectra of another isolated minor fraction of the core os of 11168-o grown at 42°c revealed that there was heterogeneity in the fractions with regards to the sialylation of residue . two separate regions of the 1d 1h are shown in figure 3; a portion of the anomeric region  and the region of the spectrum where the h3eq protons of α-neu5ac are expected . spectrum 3a shows the major fraction consistent with that published in  <cit> . in spectrum 3b, the anomeric proton found at  <dig>  ppm  is doubled up and there is a concomitant decrease in the signal intensity of h3eq protons of neu5ac. the anomeric resonance of a is distinct from the other anomeric resonances and conveniently provides a monitor of the structure of the os in its vicinity. it is expected that the chemical shift of the anomeric resonance of a would be affected by differences in the sialylation of the galactose  residue . accordingly, in the minor fraction, which has less sialylation of residue , there is the appearance of a new anomeric signal of residue a at  <dig>  ppm.

collectively, the nmr data shows that there is a difference in sialylation between the higher-mr form of c. jejuni  <dig> los  and the lower-mr form ; in the latter neu5ac can be absent, thus exhibiting asialo-gm <dig> mimicry. sialic acid is a 9-carbon sugar and has different charge properties to hexose sugars, which accounts for the approximately  <dig> kda difference in apparent mass of the two los forms as seen in figure  <dig> 

analysis of gm <dig> epitope mimicry in c. jejuni los using cholera toxin subunit b 
c. jejuni 11168-gs has been previously reported to mimic the structure of the gm <dig> ganglioside and hence displays strong binding to ctb  <cit> . therefore, to determine whether the higher- or lower-mr los forms of c. jejuni 11168-o and 11168-gs mimic the gm <dig> epitope, the ability of both los forms to bind ctb was analysed using a blotting assay. the higher-mr los of c. jejuni 11168-o and 11168-gs isolates grown at 37°c or 42°c bound ctb strongly . on the other hand, the lower-mr los did not bind to ctb, indicating that it does not exhibit gm <dig> mimicry. in contrast, the higher-mr los form of c. jejuni strain  <dig> grown at 37°c or 42°c bound ctb weakly, indicating that the saccharide terminus may exhibit some ganglioside-related mimicry, though probably not gm <dig>  binding of ctb to the lower-mr form was not detected .

analysis of c. jejuni los epitope mimicry using peanut agglutinin 
to further investigate the molecular mimicry of c. jejuni  <dig> los forms, lectin blotting was performed using pna which binds β-d-gal--d-galnac and β-d-gal-d-gal. the disaccharide β-d-gal--d-galnac is present as the terminal disaccharide of gm <dig> ganglioside, but is also present in other gangliosides . pna strongly bound both the higher-mr and lower-mr los forms of c. jejuni 11168-o and 11168-gs grown at  <dig> and 42°c . binding of the pna to the higher-mr los is consistent with the presence of gm1-like mimicry and ctb binding observed above. binding of pna to the lower-mr los is also probably due to the occurrence of a terminal β-d-gal--d-galnac in the truncated lower-mr los. taking the results of ctb and pna together suggests that the most likely structure for the lower-mr los form is an asialo-gm1-like structure.

in contrast, both higher-mr and lower-mr los of c. jejuni  <dig> did not bind pna  in a similar blotting procedure. this finding was consistent with the results of ctb-binding analysis of the los with this strain and indicated the absence of gm1-like mimicry, but does not exclude other ganglioside mimicry in the los forms of c. jejuni  <dig> 

analysis of los from c. jejuni nctc 11168-o single colonies
to determine whether the production of multiple los forms occurs as a result of a phase variation, los mini-preparations from  <dig> randomly selected, single colonies of c. jejuni 11168-o grown at  <dig> or 42°c were analysed. higher- and lower-mr los forms were present within each clonal population of c. jejuni 11168-o grown at  <dig> or 42°c. figure  <dig> shows a representative sample of los profiles from single colonies grown at 42°c which showed identical profiles with ~ <dig> % of the total los produced being of  <dig> kda form and ~ <dig> % of the  <dig> kda form. los profiles for single c. jejuni 11168-o colonies grown at 37°c were also identical to each other and to that shown in figure 1b, lane  <dig> . equally strong binding of ctb to higher-mr los was observed for all the colonies tested suggesting that the phenomenon is unlikely to have been caused by phase variation. this was further confirmed by dna sequence analysis of homopolymeric g- and a-tracts in wlan and cj1144-45c genes as described below.

the observed gm <dig> mimicry of the los epitope was also confirmed by a colony lift whereby each of the single colonies of c. jejuni 11168-o grown at 37°c was found to bind the gm1-binding ligand ctb .

analysis of the homopolymeric tracts from the phase variable genes wlan and cj1144-45c in c. jejuni nctc 11168-o single colonies
to further examine the nature of los variation in c. jejuni, gene expression of the homopolymeric regions of two known phase variable genes, wlan  and cj1144-45c , located in the los biosynthesis locus of c. jejuni were analysed. both genes were amplified from  <dig> randomly selected single colonies of c. jejuni 11168-o grown at 42°c and were subsequently sequenced. each clonal population contained an 8-residue g-tract in the wlan, which allows for complete translation of the gene. the sequence of c1144-45c was consistently found to contain a 9-residue g-tract which interrupts the reading frame. in addition, a homopolymeric a-tract of cj1144-45c was also examined and no sequence variation could be detected in any of the clonal populations. as further confirmation of the lack of phase variation in the wlan and cj1144-45c genes, the total bacterial cell population from a confluent agar plate, was subjected to similar polymerase chain reaction  analysis and sequence analysis and consistently only a single sequence for each homopolymeric tract was detected. these analyses confirmed that the growth temperature did not induce sequence variation in the lengths of the homopolymeric g-tract and a-tract in cj1144-45c as well as in the g-tract of wlan of c. jejuni 11168-o.

los form variation in human and chicken isolates of c. jejuni
c. jejuni strains originally isolated from human patients and broiler chickens were examined to determine whether multiple los forms are common in campylobacter strains . figure 7a illustrates the diversity of the los forms observed in extracts from a representative selection of human and chicken isolates of c. jejuni from those listed in table  <dig>  c. jejuni chicken isolates strains  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  7- <dig> and rm <dig> expressed both higher and lower-mr los forms whereas in strains  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> only the higher-mr los form was detected . all the human isolates were found to express both higher- and lower-mr los forms except for strain  <dig> where only one mr form  was detected . c. jejuni strains  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were also shown to increase the production of lower-mr los form, and a corresponding total increase in los production, at 42°c in contrast to 37°c .

a ctb blot of los from a representative selection of human and chicken isolates of c. jejuni , demonstrated the variability in los expression in different strains with respect to ganglioside mimicry. only the higher-mr los form was found to bind ctb in the tested strains. furthermore, the higher-mr los of some c. jejuni strains  did not bind ctb, indicating the absence of gm <dig> ganglioside mimicry in both forms of los.

discussion
this study has shown that c. jejuni nctc 11168-o and 11168-gs, as well as most randomly chosen chicken and human strains produce at least two distinct los forms when incubated at the core temperatures of human  and avian  hosts. this is consistent with previous observations that c. jejuni is capable of producing a variety of polysaccharide-related structures that are influenced by growth conditions, such as temperature  <cit> .

surface antigen modulation and generation of host-adapted variants are common attributes of many bacteria and enhance the pathogenicity and survivability of the microorganism, as well as the ability to evade the host immune response during the infection  <cit> . this variation may be achieved through several mechanisms, such as differential gene expression or enzymatic activity and specificity modulation, which can be triggered by a random and/or environmental stimuli  <cit> . it is possible to speculate that in the case of c. jejuni los, glycosyl transferases have the highest activity or are more stable promoting maximum functionality.

it is interesting to note that the growth temperature of c. jejuni nctc  <dig> was previously reported to influence the oxidative stress response  <cit> . in addition, approximately 20% of c. jejuni genes were reported to be up- or down-regulated in response to increasing the temperature from  <dig> to 42°c, including genes from the los and protein glycosylation clusters  <cit> . however, the change in los phenotype was not resolved to date.

in the present study, the phenotypic expression of the lower-mr los form appeared to be modulated by the growth temperature. this prompts speculation that the increased production of this form may be directly or indirectly caused by either specific changes in gene expression of the glycosyltransferases or glycosyl synthesis genes affecting los biosynthesis, thus leading to the production of varying amounts of the los forms. due to the apparent loss of sialylation in the lower mr los structure it is likely that the variation of the structure is attributable to functional differences in the synthesis of the transport machinery of sialic acid under the different temperatures. we consider the most likely candidate for this difference to be the dual functioning enzyme, galnac transferase and cmp-neu5ac synthase, cgta  <cit> .

it is also tempting to speculate that the increased production of the lower-mr los form at 42°c might play a role in the bacterial-host interactions of c. jejuni. the increased production of the  <dig> kda form which occurred at 42°c, the avian host body temperature, raises a possibility that this form could contribute to the commensalism by this bacterium in poultry  <cit> . the increase at 37°c in the proportion of the higher mr los, the portion of the los that is sialylated and is a gm <dig> mimic  <cit> , indicates an increase in the production of an los structure that is thought to have a role in immune evasion and survival in mammalian hosts  <cit> . these hypotheses, however, will require further investigation, particularly chicken and murine infection studies.

phase variation is the most commonly described mechanism, for antigenic variation and changes in the phenotype of the microorganism. like neisseria meningitidis and haemophilus influenzae, c. jejuni is also known to exhibit modulation of its surface polysaccharide structures as a result of phase variation  <cit> ; however, this does not appear to be the case with production of the temperature-related los form in c. jejuni. both forms were consistently produced by all clonal populations of c. jejuni 11168-o examined in this study suggesting that modulation of los forms is unlikely to be caused by phase variation. furthermore, we have analyzed the "on-off" status of phase variable genes  in c. jejuni los biosynthesis cluster to further demonstrate that the described variation of los forms is not being caused by phase variation of los genes. c. jejuni 11168-o grown at 42°c was used in this experiment as it shows greater abundance of the lower-mr los form, hence increasing the chance of detecting changes in phase variable genes. lengths of the homopolymeric g and a tracts from wlan and cj1144-45c genes did not vary in any of  <dig> randomly selected colonies, suggesting that these genes are under regulatory mechanisms unaffected by growth temperature and the described variation of los forms is not caused by variation in the lengths of the homopolymeric tracts. furthermore, no change in the gm <dig> mimicry of the clonal populations had been observed. it is also interesting to note that not all strains of c. jejuni expressed multiple los forms irrespective of the isolation origin, human or chicken.

no differences were observed in the production of the various los forms between the two variants of  <dig>  the genome sequenced and original isolate. the higher-mr form of c. jejuni  <dig>  exhibited gm1-like mimicry and, therefore, corresponded to the previously characterized los  <cit> . studies with ctb, a well-known binder of gm <dig> ganglisoide  <cit> , confirmed the presence of a gm <dig> mimic in this form of nctc  <dig>  similar mimicry was also detected among the higher-mr los forms of the other isolates of humans and chickens tested, but not in the lower-mr form of any other strains. the weak binding of ctb to the higher-mr los variant of c. jejuni  <dig> reflects that the saccharide terminus may exhibit some ganglioside-related mimic, though not gm <dig> mimicry. this is shown by the ctb binding to ganglioside-related structures not just gm <dig> and pna did not confirm the presence of a terminal β-d-gal--d-galnac. a ctb binding affinity study showed that the lower-mr form of c. jejuni nctc  <dig> failed to bind to the lectin. nevertheless, the results of the present study showed that it contains a β-d-gal--d-galnac disaccharide moiety in the core consistent with production of a truncated , but related form, of the nctc  <dig> structure previously described  <cit> , and is an asialo-gm1-like structure.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study identified the presence of a lower-mr los form produced by c. jejuni nctc  <dig> and other clinical and avian strains. the lower-mr form production was growth-temperature related as higher quantities were observed at 42°c. it is tempting to speculate that the occurrence of greater quantities of this form at avian body temperature might play a role in an adaptative mechanism to aid commensal colonization of such hosts. alternatively, changes in the relative production of the two forms of los at the higher temperature could be related to a stress response. such a phenomenon has already been seen with increased oxygen tension in the growth atmosphere of c. jejuni influencing the structural mimicry exhibited in the los of this bacterium  <cit> . although an intriguing phenomenon, further investigations are required to evaluate these alternate hypotheses.
