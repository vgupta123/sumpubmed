BACKGROUND
even though genetic susceptibility is thought to be responsible for almost 35% of the variation in colorectal cancer  risk  <cit> , high penetrance mutations in mendelian predisposition genes, such as apc, the mismatch repair  genes, or mutyh are only able to explain <5% of cases  <cit> . the recent advances in the field of genetic epidemiology have validated the hypothesis that at least part of that remaining missing susceptibility lies in the form of multiple common low-risk variants, each conferring a modest effect on disease risk.

genome-wide association studies  are one of the most widespread methodologies for the detection of such susceptibility loci. the procedure  offers an untargeted strategy for the detection of new low-penetrance variants, for it does not assume any a priori hypothesis on the location of these loci. this advantage has been proved important, since so far this kind of survey has successfully identified  <dig> variants at 8q <dig> , 8q <dig> , 10p <dig>  11q <dig>  15q <dig> , 18q <dig> , 14q <dig> , 16q <dig> , 19q <dig> , 20p <dig> , 1q <dig>  3q <dig> , 12q <dig> , 20q <dig> , 6p <dig>  11q <dig>  and xp <dig>   <cit> . the combined effect of these variants altogether is thought to explain ~7% of the familial cancer risk  <cit> . still, there is a high proportion of genetic contribution to crc risk that has not been identified.

in this study we have undertaken a new screen for crc susceptibility variants using a gwas approach on our cohort of  <dig> crc cases and  <dig> controls from the spanish population. the use of a southern-european dataset is a novelty that could lead to the identification of new candidate loci, since all of the populations where gwas analyses have been conducted so far have been of northern european origin. although this may provide additional confirmation of the relationship of the  <dig> described variants to crc risk in southern europe, we must also consider the possibility that there may be differences, at these or other particular loci in the genome, between these populations.

materials and methods
study populations
subjects in phase i were  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls ascertained through the epicolon ii project and  <dig> additional controls from the spanish national dna bank. the epicolon consortium comprises a prospective, multicentre and population-based epidemiology survey of the incidence and features of crc in the spanish population  <cit> . cases were selected as patients with de novo histologically confirmed diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma. patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, lynch syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease-related crc, and cases where patients or family refused to participate in the study were excluded.

mean age for cases in phase i was  <dig>  years . hospital-based controls were recruited through the blood collection unit of each hospital, together with cases. all of the controls were confirmed to have no history of cancer or other neoplasm and no reported family history of crc. controls were randomly selected and matched with cases for hospital, sex and age . population controls from the national dna bank were also genotyped, to lessen the deficit of controls. they were matched for sex, age  and geographical origin of the sample with the remaining cases. both cases and controls were of european ancestry and from spain .

samples in phase ii consisted of  <dig> crc patients and  <dig> controls: samples from hospital sant pau were  <dig> crc patients from a previously described cohort  <cit> ; the hospital gregorio marañón dataset consisted of  <dig> crc patients participating in a pharmagogenetic survey; catalan institute of oncology  samples were  <dig> patients who belonged to the bellvitge colorectal cancer study; the chus hospital in santiago de compostela was a subsample of  <dig> participants included in a pharmacogenetic study;  <dig> crc cases and  <dig> controls came from the spanish national dna bank; and  <dig> crc cases and  <dig> dna controls belonged to the epicolon i project  <cit> . of the cases,  <dig> % were male and  <dig> % female. controls were matched for gender. age mean was  <dig>   for cases and  <dig>   for controls. gender and hospital distribution of samples for case and control groups on both phases is shown on .

dna was obtained from frozen peripheral blood by standard extraction procedures for all samples. cases and controls were extracted in mixed batches to avoid bias.

ethical standards
the study was approved by the “comité Ético de investigación clínica de galicia”, and each of the institutional review boards of the participating hospitals. all samples were obtained with written informed consent reviewed by the ethical board of the corresponding hospital, in accordance with the tenets of the declaration of helsinki.

snp genotyping and qc
affymetrix array  <dig>  , which includes probes for almost 1m snp markers, was chosen to obtain genome-wide coverage for phase i genotyping. genotype calling for affymetrix  <dig>  was performed with the birdseed algorithm, included within birdsuite v <dig>   <cit> . samples were organized in  <dig> batches of 16<n< <dig> according to hospital of origin for computational purposes. we obtained valid genotypes for  <dig>  <dig> snps by these means. quality control of the data, performed mainly with plink v <dig>   <cit> , included the removal of both snps and samples with genotyping success rates <99%  and samples with discordant gender between clinical recorded data and affymetrix-asigned sex . hardy-weinberg equilibrium  was evaluated and markers with phwe<1x10- <dig> in controls were removed from further analyses . snps with mafs below  <dig>   were also eliminated due to low power to detect true signals and to avoid unnecessary noise. finally, differential missingness between cases and controls was also accounted for by excluding markers with p-values below 1x10- <dig> . this test compares genotyping error rates for the affected vs. unaffected groups in order to avoid an increase in false positive findings due to this bias. finally, snps with poor clustering were also excluded after visualisation with evoker   <cit> . a total of  <dig>  <dig> snps remained after this filtering.

to address the possibility of underlying population stratification, principal component analysis  on a subset of  <dig>  <dig> randomly chosen independent snps  was also performed on the full phase i cohort using the eigensoft smartpca software  <cit> . long-range ld regions, as described by price et al. <cit> , were also removed from this analysis. outliers, taken as samples spread on principal components  <dig> and  <dig> were removed from subsequent analyses, since they deviated from the main cloud. no evidence was found of population differences between cases and controls for the first  <dig> components of the pca analysis, as stated in the tracy-widsom test . other potentially confounding variables, such as markers typed using the nsp or sty restriction endonucleases, hospital of collection, genotyping plate, or geographical origin of the samples were also checked for as sources for stratification . all results were concordant with the original assumption of a single originating population except for hospital of origin. when considered as a confounding variable, the epicolon cohort clustered into three separate subgroups: samples from the donostia hospital , the only collection centre for the basque country region , samples from the meixoeiro hospital , the single collection point in galicia , and all others  . an additional pca comprising the full phase i cohort and the hapmap <dig> populations  was also performed to illustrate the clustering of these populations   <cit> . epicolon ii samples that clustered away from the european end of the plot  were excluded from further analyses.

the final case dataset comprised  <dig> samples . the total count per subgroup was  <dig> for vas,  <dig> for gal and  <dig> for rest.

genotyping in phase ii was conducted by sequenom massarray technology . rs <dig> at 10q <dig>  could not be included in the analyses for genotyping design reasons. quality control was performed with plink similarly to phase i. genotyping for both phases was performed at the santiago de compostela node of the spanish genotyping centre.

statistical analysis
association analysis was assessed as a 1°-of-freedom χ <dig> allelic test for each of the three subgroups independently for phase i, and for second phase replication, with plink  <cit> . the adequacy of the distribution of p-values was evaluated using quantile-quantile  plots of test statistics. meta-analysis was also conducted using plink in phase i. the method is based on a mantel-haenszel approach for data pooling. cochran´s q statistic and the i <dig> heterogeneity index were also estimated to account for inter-population heterogeneity between groups, which was defined as i2>75%  <cit> . for markers above this threshold, a random-effects model was considered, whereas fixed-effect results were otherwise reported. risks  with 95% confidence intervals  associated with each marker were then estimated assuming the appropriate model. phase ii analyses were adjusted by age, given the mean differences between the case and control populations for these cohorts. pooled analysis was performed by logistic regression, considering genotyping phase and population subgroup as covariates. associations by phenotype  were examined by logistic regression in case-only analyses for the two associated snps . additional statistical calculations and plots were performed using r  <cit> .

imputation
imputation between the two recombination hotspots encompassing each of the  <dig> loci that showed evidence of association in phase i was accomplished with impute v <dig> using two reference panels:  <dig> genomes project  for wide coverage, and hapmap <dig>  for deep coverage  <cit> . results from the imputation were later tested for association with snptest  <cit> . imputation results were filtered by minor allele frequency  of the markers , by missing data proportion , and the frequentist-add-proper-info column of the output. this latter statistic is the ratio of the empirically observed variance of the allele dosage to the expected binomial variance p at hwe, where p is the observed allele frequency from hapmap  <cit> . optimal values should be within the  range and provide a measure for quality and accuracy of the imputation. since the proportion of cases and controls deviates significantly from the standard 1: <dig>  we also considered the possibility that the imputed genotype probabilities for each marker were different in both subsets. since impute gives back the imputation results as a probability for each genotype, we decided to filter out snps for which the probability of two out of the three genotypes was ≥25%  in at least 5% of the cases or the controls. this way we can eliminate samples for which genotype imputation has been inaccurate. imputation results were plotted with the snap on-line tool  <cit> .

RESULTS
stratification within the epicolon cohort
we observed using pca that there was a batch effect due to differences by hospital at which sample had been collected, thereby dividing the epicolon cohort into three separate subgroups. we thus proceeded on the basis that each cluster - the gal, vas and rest case-control groups - was a separate sample set. association results were then obtained for each of the subpopulations separately and then meta-analysed. q-q plots for the subgroups  showed an improvement in the systematic inflation for the distribution of the association p-values for the gal, rest and vas subgroups . lambda genomic factor calculations  were consistent with no evidences of an increased false discovery rate. additional file 2: figure s1d represents the q-q plot distribution after meta-analysis of the three subpopulations. some snps still seem to deviate from the expected distribution. these were later discovered to be artefacts of the calling procedure and were further removed with evoker.

association analyses
we found  <dig> snps at  <dig> genomic loci snps associated with crc risk at p≤10- <dig>  . notably, i <dig> heterogeneity values for the three subgroups  were all  <dig> for these markers, thereby reflecting homogeneity in these associated snps.

using imputation, we examined the ld blocks defined by recombination hotspots  around the  <dig> snps for evidence of stronger signals of association. additional file 1: table s <dig> provides a summary of the loci and extent of the imputed regions. this analysis improved the association at  <dig> of the  <dig> loci: 1p <dig> ; 14q <dig>  ; 15q <dig>  ; and 22q <dig>   .

replication
the ±1mb regions flanking all  <dig> loci with evidence of association in phase i were examined in the united kingdom corgi gwas cohort through proxy snp assessment  <cit> . only  <dig> of these locations showed to have some corgi associated snp at an established p value threshold of p≤10- <dig>  however, ld analysis  showed them all to be independent signals . therefore, our attempt to replicate the association signals in silico was not successful for any of the variants.

since there has been extensive literature on the differences amongst northern and southern european populations  <cit> , we decided to perform a further pca on  <dig>  independent markers in order to compare allelic frequencies among the epicolon controls, the hapmap <dig> ceu and tsi populations, and the wellcome trust case control consortium  control cohorts  <cit> . this analysis effectively separated the northern and southern-european populations . given this evidence, we decided to attempt replication of the best-associated markers  at these  <dig> loci in an independent spanish cohort . thirty-two snps were finally selected to be genotyped at this phase ii according to ld measures at the  <dig> loci and experimental design. the markers genotyped at each locus and their association values in the replication phase are described in table  <dig>

two out of the replicated  <dig> snps, rs <dig>  and rs <dig>  were successfully replicated at a nominal level of p< <dig>  in this second phase  and p= <dig> , or= <dig>  , respectively). although the association signals were very modest, pooled analysis of the data from both phases was consistent with the presence of a potential crc susceptibility variant in these locations , and the signals remained significant across population subgroups  . another two variants at locus 14q <dig>  were significant in phase ii, but their or were in different directions for each of the phases, thereby reflecting a potential false positive event in phase i. given the marker sizes, this finding is entirely compatible with a random positive finding at a significance level of  <dig> . with regards to phenotype analysis, rs <dig> seemed to be slightly overrepresented in males vs. females ), whereas rs <dig> was more prevalent in rectal cancers ). none of the other variables used in the subgroup analyses provided statistically significant results . it is also remarkable that none of the remaining three snps genotyped at these two loci  appeared to be replicated in this second phase, although rs <dig> showed a borderline p value in phase ii ; in the case of rs <dig> and rs <dig> at 8p <dig> r-squared ld values among the three snps seem to show that the three markers are independent.

previous susceptibility loci
in addition to the search of new susceptibility variants, we also investigated the association signals for  <dig> of the known crc susceptibility variants  <cit> . rs <dig> on xp <dig>  could not be evaluated due to the fact that sexual chromosome data need to be processed differently. considering these markers were described from illumina array tagsnp panels, most of them were not directly genotyped in our chip; therefore we proceeded with the evaluation of the association signals by considering the closest related proxy snp . direct evidence of replication  was found for  <dig> of the snps . the remaining loci, although not significant, showed ors in the same directions as those described in the literature. we must however highlight that some of these snps  have already been found to present differences in northern and southern european populations, a fact that is consistent with our study not being able to replicate the association signals at these loci  <cit> . imputation of the ld regions around these associated loci was conducted to search for an enhancing of the signals. no significant improvements were found, except for locus 15q <dig>  for which an imputed snp, rs <dig>  15kb upstream the grem <dig> gene, scored the best p value in our dataset . this snp has a good pairwise relationship with the formerly described rs <dig>  .

discussion
genome-wide association studies have so far successfully identified  <dig> crc susceptibility snps  <cit> . although this has been a significant improvement in the unravelling of the genetic basis of the disease, these variants alone do not completely explain all the inherited variation that has been attributed to crc.

following the lead of the previous studies, we addressed the issue of trying to detect new colorectal cancer susceptibility variants through the performance of a gwas in a spanish cohort. this was the first attempt to perform a crc gwas in a southern european population. by these means, we were able to positively identify two new candidate variants that have shown good evidence of association with crc risk: rs <dig> at 1p <dig> and rs <dig>  at 8p <dig> 

previous susceptibility loci
during the analysis, we were faced with the fact that, although there were no differences between case and control populations, there was a significant stratification issue determined by the hospital of origin of the samples. because of this, the analyses had to be modified to match our case scenario without losing significant power. nevertheless, the substructure in our cohort did not seem to greatly affect outcome quality. the evaluation on the  <dig> out of  <dig> already-described signals achieved direct replication for  <dig> of the loci . the other  <dig> markers did not show evidence of association, probably due to the lack of power in our cohort to detect such moderate effects. nevertheless, or directions were consistent with those previously published. we must highlight at this point that the best-associated markers for these regions did not always match with the best proxy for the already described snps. this would make sense if we consider that any given gwas relies on an indirect approach, and we would expect the associated snps to only be tagging the real causative variant. results for allele frequencies and ors seem consistent with the bibliography  <cit> . we consider the replication of these loci an important achievement, since the majority of these association signals had not been previously evaluated in southern european cohorts  where a common inversion is known to occur  <cit> , whereas eigenvectors 4- <dig> were driven by the hla-a locus in the 6q <dig> - <dig>  region of chromosome  <dig>  which has been also described as highly variable between populations  <cit> . given this evidence, we proceeded on to replicate these  <dig> loci in an independent spanish cohort.

snps rs <dig> and rs <dig> were successfully replicated in phase ii analyses. the former snp, rs <dig> is located on an intronic position within hypothetical locus loc <dig> on 1p <dig>  this predicted gene is believed to code for a single-pass type i membrane protein. moreover, it lies 252kb upstream the slc5a <dig> gene, a member of the solute carrier family, which could be a feasible regulation target. slc proteins constitute good candidates to harbour crc susceptibility loci, since some family members have been proven to act as tumour suppressors. in fact, the slc5a <dig> gene is properly expressed in normal colon, but silenced in aberrant crypt foci through gene methylation  <cit> .

the rs <dig> snp is located in the 8p <dig> locus, 128kb downstream dusp <dig>  this gene is a member of the dual kinase phosphatase family, which are well-known tumour suppressors too  <cit> . they act through the downregulation of map kinases, thus preventing cellular proliferation and differentiation. deletions in this gene have already been described to happen in other types of cancers, such as those of the breast and lung. in the case of crc, dusp <dig> expression appears to be modulated by kras mutations  <cit> . moreover, it has recently been described that dusp <dig> expression is associated with microsatellite instability in crc and causes increased cell proliferation  <cit> .

the fact that these two snps were not replicated during the initial assessment of the association signals in the corgi cohort, together with the north-south discrepancies seen in the pca analysis, could be a sign of differences in the tagging of the real causative variant amongst populations. even when europeans are presumed to be genetically homogeneous, it is not unrealistic to believe that punctual ld variations may be actually happening within populations, and that these may constitute a certain impediment in our ability to replicate association signals  <cit> .

although none of the markers reached a final genome-wide significant p value, two of the snps in our study  were favourably replicated in the second phase and pooled analysis. however the limitations of this study , we believe these two regions are good candidates for crc susceptibility loci. the peculiarities of these loci, particularly those relating to potential northern-southern european differences, may have important repercussions on subsequent analysis. for this reason, the eventual identification of the functional variant is of uttermost importance. finer mapping of the locus, coupled with additional replication efforts in larger cohorts will be needed to fully ascertain the relationship between these variants and disease. moreover, it is important to highlight that, were these two snps true susceptibility variants, they would constitute a decrease in the crc missing heritability fraction. this is an essential point in our road towards the identification of high-risk individuals within populations  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the novelty of this study was the use of a southern-european dataset to perform a crc gwas study that led to the identification of two new candidate variants: rs <dig> at 1p <dig> and rs <dig> at 8p <dig>  these two snps are located near the slc5a <dig> and dusp <dig> loci, respectively. some family members of the slc proteins, as well as the dusp gene, have been proven to act as tumour suppressors. therefore, both of them could be good functional candidates for the association signals. finer mapping and further replication in larger cohorts will be needed to ascertain their relationship with crc susceptibility. the peculiarities of these loci, particularly those relating to potential northern-southern european differences, may have important repercussions on subsequent analyses.
