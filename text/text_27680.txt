BACKGROUND
genetic differentiation, fundamental to population genetics, is initiated by restricted gene flow and reproductive isolation mechanisms within gene pools  <cit> . habitat and population fragmentation with concomitant disruption of ecological connectivity is threatening biota worldwide, on large scales determined by time since isolation and physical reproductive barriers among demes  <cit> . on finer scales, genetic differentiation may additionally involve reproductive behaviors and social interactions  <cit> . addressing genetic effects of physical barriers and reproductive behaviors in novel populations may forecast evolutionary consequences of human intervention.

natural ecological connectivity may fluctuate in time and space, but anthropogenic alterations  typically exaggerate this variation. human impacted water flows and water habitat fragmentation expanded greatly worldwide in the twentieth century  <cit> . in europe  close to all large river systems are fragmented by dams  <cit> , inevitably presenting impediments to migration. construction of habitat corridors to sustain ecological connectivity may in theory counteract negative fragmentation effects  <cit> , although empirical evidence is limited. a number of often retrospective fish passage improvements have been designed to reduce ecosystem wide effects of  dams  <cit> . dams commonly allow passive or active downstream drift of fish, but obstruct upstream migration. world commissions of dams with contributing papers  <cit>  and recent reviews  <cit> , highlight the need for empirical studies addressing long term effects of fish passage success. migration barriers may obstruct passage directly or negate otherwise adaptive benefits of homing and assortative mating indirectly  <cit> .

genetic drift and behavior may induce reproductive isolation mechanisms operating on fine scales. genetic microstructure even within continuous habitat is reported  <cit> , although the biological relevance of weak differentiation is debated  <cit> . within-lake genetic structure for highly mobile fish without obvious migration barriers have similarly been documented  <cit>  for a traditional evolutionary time perspective. genetic structuring and adaptive microevolution may, however, also occur on contemporary time scales  <cit> . recently founded or invasive species provide opportunities to study initial genetic divergence and evolution in the wild  <cit> , but few studies have evaluated contemporary genetic structure in the invasive species  <cit> . moreover, we are not aware of assessment of initial genetic structure in recently founded and highly migrating species that are temporally  admixed. recently founded salmonid species in freshwater lake habitats represent natural small scale experiments that provide opportunities to study the details of early stages of population divergence.

micro-scale studies under initial admixture introduce challenges concerning sampling design and analytical approaches. for obvious reasons, sample sizes are often restricted both in numbers and temporal replicates. in continuous habitats sampling units may be difficult to delineate. widely used bayesian methods to infer cryptic population structure  <cit>  may not, however, detect population substructure of recently established populations with low differentiation. inclusion of population migrants and hybrids  in presumably distinct populations may lead to underestimates of differentiation and erroneous conclusions regarding reproductive isolation.

reproductive isolation may be reinforced by homing, as documented within a wide range of species  <cit> . successful reproduction of migrants may be common, caused by relaxed selection against non-natives resulting in non-native offspring, or hybrid offspring with admixed ancestry which break down incipient population differentiation  <cit> . further differentiation requires reduced reproductive success of non-native and hybrid progeny. therefore, studies of population admixture and hybrid contribution to population segregation under incomplete divergence are important and may possibly unveil biological relevant differentiation. traditional measures of population differentiation combined with recently developed bayesian statistics  <cit>  now permit studies of how inter-population hybrids may affect population differentiation.

here we study genetic differentiation of arctic char , introduced around  <dig> , across and within two lakes: pålsbufjorden  and the downstream tunhovdfjorden  . the two lakes, naturally connected by a short river, were separated by a dam in  <dig>  creating two hydropower reservoirs. both lakes have geographically distinct char spawning sites  for which we assess population connectivity implementing  <dig> microsatellites. the first objective was to examine genetic structure across lakes to quantify present effects of two migration enhancements at the dam; a subterranean tunnel and spill gates. an additional summer sample  of lake feeding and presumably admixed char from pal was included to assist interpretation of differentiation. we expected to find greater genetic differentiation across lakes than across populations within lakes, and assignment of sample × to pal populations. we also expected that passive migration downstream would exceed upward migration and result in observed asymmetric migration and associated genetic variation. the second was to examine migration patterns and population hybrid contributions potentially responsible for contemporary genetic substructure. due to expectations of low population differentiation in the progress towards reproductive isolation, we intend to deliberate over the paradox of population divergence in the face of migration, rather than to state absolute assertions.

RESULTS
amplification and allele calling of  <dig> individuals over  <dig> sites was obtained in  <dig> % of the cases, and secondary amplifying and allele calling of a subsample gave consistent results. number of alleles per locus averaged  <dig>  . quality control screening did not reveal indications of scoring error due to stuttering or evidence for large allele dropout. the test for null alleles assuming hardy-weinberg equilibrium  suggested that null alleles may be present for locus sco <dig> in sample site t <dig>  by general excess of homozygotes. however, the combined probability for all homozygote class frequencies was not significant . no deviations from hw were found, but nonrandom association of alleles from different loci was indicated in  <dig> and  <dig>  of  <dig> tests uncorrected and after false discovery rate  correction  <cit>  at 5% level, respectively. genetic variation revealed a mean value of local fst =  <dig>  , and inbreeding f =  <dig>   over sites.

dam barrier to migration and gene flow
measured lake water levels and estimated velocities in the fishways indicated possible upstream migration only within very limited windows of time. during  <dig> -  <dig>  migration through the tunnel was feasible in less than  <dig> % of the year . migration through the spill gates was possible in less than  <dig> % of the year . upstream migration was possible in all seasons through gates, but only through the tunnel in spring.

observed heterozygosity and allelic richness was similar between lakes . number of private alleles found totaled  <dig>   <dig> in tun and  <dig> in pal .

the total allele frequency variation consisted of  <dig> %  variation within populations,  <dig> %  variation among spawning sites within lakes and no variation between lakes . genetic differentiation of char from the two connected lakes pal and tun was, however, highly significant  but very low  =  <dig> ). removal of first generation migrants , amounting to  <dig> and 9% in pal and tun , respectively, did not affect this differentiation. structure did not detect genetic structure among lakes or sites .

estimated fst and exact tests revealed that one spawning population  was significantly different from a summer feeding sample  in pal . sample × assigned to both lakes , and 30% was most similar to spawning site t <dig> on a population level , indicating upstream migration.

pairwise test of differentiation , and p-values from exact test in tfpga  between spawning char in pal , tun  and a mixed summer sample in pal . indicative adjusted nominal level  in pairwise test for multiple comparisons is  <dig> , initial k =  <dig>  non-significant  and significant  differentiation at 5% level after fdr correction.

frequencies of first generation  migrants and char from the spawning sites  and a mixed summer sample in pal  assigned  to the five spawning sites estimated in geneclass. frequencies of f <dig> migrants are given in brackets.

migration beyond f <dig> was assessed with a maximum likelihood approach for assignment and with bayesian estimates for present and contemporary estimates. self-assignment of individual char in geneclass <dig> revealed  <dig> and 46% correct assignments to lake pal and tun, respectively, suggesting a downstream source-sink structure. probability estimates of ancestral origin over the last generation estimated in the software program bimr, also indicated high, but more symmetric migration rates. with the two lakes as populations, mode allele frequencies showed almost equal ancestral native origin for the two lakes :  <dig> -  <dig>  tun; 59%, hpdi:  <dig> - 90), with estimated hpdi for non-native origin of  <dig> - 65% and  <dig> - 74%, in pal and tun respectively.

mode probability of hybrid ancestral origin for the pooled samples within lakes estimated in bimr were 50% in pal  and also 50%  in tun. nevertheless, pure origin from the home lake was more common than pure origin from the other lake.

lentic population migration and admixture
all except one test of genetic differentiation among spawning sites were significant . mean standardized differentiation  was  <dig>  . exact tests corroborated the pattern of significantly differentiated spawning sites . using spawning sites as prior populations, 37% of the char assigned to its sampled site, varying from  <dig> - 62% among sites . mean probability of best assignment, however, was only 51% , indicating recent admixture, migration, or un-sampled populations. exclusion of  <dig> char  found to be f <dig> migrants across spawning sites  increased population segregation and resulted in all spawning populations being significantly different . this finding corroborates the estimated migration rates. analyses in immanc verified migrant detection  with a power of  <dig> . the bayesian probability that the sampled alleles within spawning sites originated from the same site last generation  were  <dig>  across sites , and higher than the probability of origin from any other population .

mixed ancestry analyses indicated that population hybrids constituted a substantial proportion within spawning sites. the majority of hybrids within all sites were progeny of native and non-native char , whereas hybrids of two non-natives were less common . similar to pooled lake estimates, the mode probability of home origin within sites was consistently higher than pure non-native origin within sites, and consequently higher for hybrids with partial native ancestry than for any other mixed ancestry across sites. standard deviations of mixed ancestry estimates were generally similar to mode estimates.

potential interpretation bias
potential bias and biological relevance of observed data were addressed to assure sound interpretations. fst tests excluding loci with possible ld  revealed similar differentiations as for all loci combined . the fst estimate per locus averaged  <dig>  . exclusion of single loci generally weakened spawning site differentiation, but did not change the above pattern, thus indicating neutral behavior of markers.

amova analyses segregated based on year-classes revealed 100% variation within sites and a lack of variation among year-classes , whereas hierarchical analyses based on spawning sites revealed that  <dig> % of genetic variation stemmed from within-population variation and  <dig> %  from among-population variation. thus, genetic variation was congruent with the high variability of microsatellites used, indicating temporal stability among consecutive year-classes. pairwise year-classes were not significantly different within any spawning site , or pooled across sites . removal of year-classes one-by-one changed the significance in  <dig> % of the pairwise tests, but did not affect the pattern of differentiation among spawning sites.

we did not find evidence for family structures affecting population differentiations. simulations indicated a power of  <dig>  and  <dig>  to discriminate unrelated from full sib and half sib, respectively. only  <dig> % of pairwise tests had relatedness coefficients ≥  <dig> , indicating half sib relationship, and half of these were across sites. mean distribution of relatedness  for the pooled dataset was negative , although positively skewed  and not normally distributed . sites individually revealed the same pattern , with lack of bimodal patterns that could have indicated kin-groups.

effective population sizes  were estimated to be  <dig> -  <dig> individuals within spawning sites,  <dig> -  <dig> within lakes, and  <dig> in total , supporting both across and within lake genetic structure. estimates were not affected by prior values of ne. estimates of effective parental population size  were generally higher but similar to ne, except negative and infinite for population p <dig>  this may indicate sampling error, or no evidence for ld caused by genetic drift due to a finite number of parents. tests for ld did not, however, give significant deviations for any loci combination at this site, after fdr correction. recent bottlenecks over all loci were not confirmed for any of the tests , assuming a mixed mutation model . neither did tests for di-nucleotide and tetra-nucleotide loci separately, under tpm and a single-step mutation model  respectively, reveal signs of severe loss of allelic diversity , except for population p <dig> and tetra-nucleotide loci, where the wilcoxon test for heterozygosity excess was significant . test for isolation by distance  was positive but not significant .

estimated mean effective population size  and parental population size  with 95% c.i., from onesamp and ldne respectively from pal  and tun  and pooled data. negative estimates are reported as infinite .

forward simulated fst estimates , indicated that genetic drift alone may have caused the observed population differentiation. for instance, five populations with ne =  <dig> were significantly differentiated  after a mean migration rate of  <dig>  in  <dig> generations, assuming initial admixture after introduction. ten independent replicates of this scenario indicated similar differentiation . immanc indicated detection power for migrants  and hybrids  in our sampled dataset to be  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

a forward simulated alternative hypotheses of m =  <dig>  revealed high differentiation  between reproductive sites, whereas m =  <dig>  revealed lack of differentiation . a scenario without migration only indicated  <dig> %  f <dig> migrants in geneclass, similar to expectations from type  <dig> errors. similar analyses in immanc indicated  <dig> %  f <dig> migrants and  <dig> %  f <dig> hybrids, with mean power >  <dig> . coalescent simulations supported that drift alone may have caused contemporary site fidelity .

discussion
migrations
our results suggest that constructed gateways for migration ensured alternate habitat utilization and gene flow across the dam separating the two studied lakes. significant differentiation was found between spawning char from the two interconnected lakes, but differentiation among populations within lakes equaled or exceeded that for lakes. without assuming any direct relationship between fst and gene flow , these relative measures are low and indicate high connectivity across the dam. char with genetic assignment to distinct populations in both lakes were caught during feeding migration in the upper lake in summer, indicating upstream migration across the dam. corroborating this, gene diversity and genetic structure were similar across and within lakes.

extensive migration reflecting seasonal foraging admixture across lakes and populations is independently corroborated by tagging studies  <cit> . barrier type, hydrology and life stages of focal species all interact in determining the impact of barriers  <cit> . tunnels associated with turbine outflow at dams are known to attract ascending salmonids  <cit> . the lack of turbines in the pal dam tunnel makes migration through the tunnel possible. it is an open question, however, to what extent char in our study lakes utilize the spill gates or the tunnel for  migration. ongoing studies in brown trout also reveal high dispersal across the focal dam, with unknown proportional use of the fishways . regardless, results indicate that char, in both cases, take advantage of the highly restricted time window suitable for upstream migration. disentangling present from previous genetic structure and biological interpretation of low differentiation is, however, challenging , and results should therefore be interpreted with caution.

contemporary genetic substructure
the present study documents that genetically differentiated sympatric populations can be established within decades. pairwise genetic differentiation was found to be significant, but very low, both among lakes and among most spawning sites within lakes, indicating spatial reproductive isolation even within continuous habitat. estimates of ne supported this. however, structure did not reveal any population structuring. performance of bayesian clustering methods decreased for fst <  <dig>   <cit> , and we propose that even the novel algorithm used in structure  <cit>  may not detect recently established populations with very low differentiation .

low differentiation is expected due to the short time since species introduction, and the migratory behavior of char. following the simplistic  <cit>  equation fst ≈ 1/4nm + 1), our mean local fst estimates indicate long term nm =  <dig> , and migration rates of  <dig>  assuming ne =  <dig>  fixed m =  <dig>  would reveal the same differentiation if ne is as low as  <dig>  as an example,  <dig> individuals and m =  <dig>  result in the same differentiation as e.g.  <dig> individuals with  <dig> % gene flow. in contrast, if we assume f <dig> analyses  are representative for present gene flow, and implement ne's of  <dig>  the present nm is  <dig> , likely overestimated due to common reproductive inferiority in migrants. consequently, mean gene flow between populations may have decreased since introduction. thus, present genetic structure does not reflect panmixia  <cit> . both estimates, however, indicate that gene flow is too small to bring about drift connectivity  <cit> , but too large for bayesian detection of subdivision  <cit> . a denotation of the sampled reproductive entities as populations, according to the evolutionary and especially the ecological paradigm  <cit>  is, however, debatable. maximum fst estimates will be limited by heterozygosity  <cit> , and estimated differentiation may underestimate true population differentiation  <cit> , especially when gene diversity is high  <cit> . similar standardized population differentiation is previously found in char  <cit> . direct comparisons of observed θ are complicated, but similarly low and biological relevant differentiations are found in both mammals and fish  <cit> . interestingly, similarly low, but significant differentiations are also found among populations of char founded thousands of years ago  <cit> , and population structure of lake-dwelling brook char  has been found on a smaller geographical scale under migration-drift equilibrium  <cit>  than in our study. low but significant pairwise differentiations are also found in invading catadromous crustaceans separated after recent colonization  <cit> . this study also documented strong genetic drift simultaneously with significant differentiation , but among year classes, as opposed to our study.

true substructures in our study were corroborated by ne estimates, genetic variability, year-class stability and low number of sib-groups within sites. invasive species, such as char in our lakes, are expected to express low genetic variation and ne, caused by founder events and population bottlenecks  <cit> . the high level of genetic variation within the examined loci in our populations does not suggest depauperate populations or bottlenecks on the surveyed scale, which would otherwise certainly support genetic differentiation caused by strong genetic drift in very small founding populations. the concept of founder populations, however, suggests that current structure is novel. we are not aware of evidence from the literature that fish populations bred in admixture may resume historic population structures in novel habitat. simulations, however, documented that drift alone, even in larger populations, could cause rapid differentiation. estimation of population size based on single samples relies on a number of simplifying assumptions  <cit> . our estimated population sizes should therefore be interpreted with caution. echosounder and gillnetting experiments  <cit>  suggest a population size of char around  <dig> in pal, returning ne/n ≈  <dig> , which is common for marine fish  <cit>  but low compared to most salmonids  <cit> . nevertheless, estimated ne and nb gave similar results, and suggest population sizes sufficient to confer contemporary genetic stability as well, as opposed to a transitory or strict metapopulation structure  <cit> . it is possible, however, that estimates are inflated by immigrants and sampling of hybrid zones, even though no deviations from hw were evident. regardless, the question remains whether one is actually able to sample biological populations correctly, and if hybrid contribution represents true population structure. the presence of immigrants and hybrids, not contributing to the reproductive population gene pool, can easily complicate interpretations of genetic diversity, ne and genetic differentiation.

initial genetic structure
the low level of interspecies competition and vacant niches fits well with rapid establishment of char in our lakes, and zooplanktivores such as char show a high rate of invasion success  <cit> . genetic differentiation by means of the evolution of reproductive isolation can be viewed as non-ecological modes of differentiation such as founder effect or genetic drift in small populations, or by divergent natural selection  <cit> . lag time between initial colonization and the onset of rapid population growth is expected in invasive species  <cit> , in particular if evolutionary adaptation is important during colonization. thus, the rapid expansion in the lakes surveyed  <cit>  corroborates the independent simulations, pointing to genetic drift as an initial diversifying factor for observed population differentiation. however, theory  <cit> , experiments  <cit>  and empirical studies  <cit>  all suggest a potential for rapid evolutionary changes involving adaptation in newly founded populations. moderate levels of plasticity are also typical for char  <cit> , and may also have been optimal for fast genetic evolution  <cit> .

the combined genetic and ecological data suggest that the initial genetic structure and diversity within our lakes is a result of site fidelity and initial drift. several evolutionary forces may, however, interact at the same time. realistic and rapid drivers of cryptic kin selection  <cit>  or discontinuous adaptive variation  <cit>  may add to incipient reproductive isolation. once sub-structure is established, site fidelity, drift, and low effective migration rates may strengthen differentiation in time and space. such isolation by adaptation  <cit>  is likely facilitating drift in neutral loci by reduced gene flow as a general barrier mechanism  <cit> , and even neutral markers may detect adaptation in the face of intermediate migration  <cit> .

differentiation despite extensive migration
substantial migration among reproductive sites was found, without significant ibd, suggesting little present drift. thus, although common in salmonids, equilibrium between gene flow and genetic drift is not present  <cit> . migration analyses may be biased by method assumptions, un-sampled populations, low differentiation and convergence problems  <cit> . however, all methods used to interpret migration in our study, indicated considerable migration among lakes and populations. extensive migration among populations is often seen in salmonids  <cit> . homing and kin discrimination will, however, contribute to genetic structuring and is widely known in fish  <cit> , particularly char  <cit> . pairwise genetic differentiation of other neighbouring lacustrine char populations has been found to be highly significant, despite long term migration rates of  <dig>  -  <dig>  individuals per generation  <cit> . low levels of effective migration, i.e. gene flow among sympatric populations, contrary indicate breeding site fidelity in established populations  <cit> . reproductive divergence despite extensive migration in the study at hand indicates restricted effective gene flow between lakes and populations, even after  <dig> generations. thus, at first glance, one may be tempted to conclude that results indicate reproductive selection against immigrants in newly established populations, along the lines of previous studies  <cit> . alternatively, one may speculate that breakdown of non-native gene flow is caused by reduced reproductive fitness of population hybrids.

hybrid contribution during naturalization
the hierarchical bayesian analyses of mixed ancestry confirmed non-native spawning success. the large proportion of hybrids documents reproduction by immigrants, i.e. relaxed selection against non-natives early in differentiation and survival of hybrids. selection against population hybrids and immigrants strengthen divergence  <cit> . hybrids of sympatric and closely related  perch  were found to have reduced fitness in early life stages in laboratory experiments, but the authors did not test for hybrid inferiority in vivo  <cit> . novel habitats without competition as in our study may have promoted survival of hybrids, despite potentially reduced fitness. however, hybrids may be less competitive in secondary stages of naturalization, as increased population divergence reduces hybrid fitness  <cit> .

in our study, hybrids without parental origin from their spawning site  constituted a minor part of mature char caught at their reproductive site. the considerably larger proportion of individuals with partial native ancestral origin indicates hybrid homing. reproductive units sustained by kin discrimination are found in a range of species  <cit> , and hybrid juveniles of char will be in close proximity to kin when hatching. population differentiation, however, could only be established if reproductive success of returning hybrids is low. admixed individuals would otherwise have caused migration loads obscuring effects of selection and differentiation  <cit> . postmating reproductive isolation and hybrid inferiority have been addressed for a century  <cit> . both theoretical and empirical studies frequently reveal selection against hybrids during speciation, although its origin seems unclear  <cit> . sexual selection  against hybrids is found across taxa , and may also characterize char. such mechanisms may evolve faster in small populations  <cit> , as within our sites. social recognition of relatives in fish using odour cues can induce assortative behavior in fish  <cit> . finally, high dispersal rates may increase the absolute number of hybrids, but the increased competition reduces hybrid reproductive fitness, and consequently increases reproductive isolation of the resident population  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
migration corridors between populations separated by dams may be valuable for sustaining evolutionary potential. this study demonstrates that even temporally very limited connectivity through a subterranean tunnel and spill gates between two regulated lakes, likely counteract genetic isolation in char.

initial stages of genetic divergence of subpopulations, despite high migration rates, are documented in this study. we are not aware of previous studies addressing hybrid migration and reproductive success in recently founded and admixed populations. our study indicates that population differentiation may be detectable, despite inclusion of hybrid sub-populations, when assessing genetic structure among populations. combined also with independent mark-recapture data by aass  <cit> , our genetic approach indicates that hybrids contribute extensively to migration rates in recently founded populations. population hybrid events may have been important in establishing the diverse population structure in the novel habitat  <cit> . however, present differentiation implicates nascent non-native and hybrid inferiority, whether biologic or ethologic  <cit> . estimates generally gave wide hpdi, an inherent problem expected from low differentiation affecting accuracy  <cit> , and results must be interpreted with caution.

few population genetic software programs have been evaluated with respect to their performance in detecting low genetic differentiation, making interpretation of differentiation close to admixture difficult  <cit> . however, restricted power in admixture analyses should not restrict studies of hybridization mechanisms, as they raise consequential questions in micro-evolution and behavioral ecology. both small scale empirical and larger simulation studies of incomplete reproductive isolation may guide management of invasive and naturalized species, potentially unveiling initial population differentiation mechanisms.
