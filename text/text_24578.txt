BACKGROUND
microtubules are dynamic cytoskeletal polymers essential for various cell functions such as intracellular organization, ordered vesicle transport, cell division and establishment of cell polarity. in higher plants, several distinct microtubular arrays have been identified, namely the interphase cortical array, preprophase band, mitotic spindle and phragmoplast  <cit> . the basic building blocks of microtubules are heterodimers of globular α- and β-tubulin subunits. they are arranged in a head-to-tail fashion to form  <dig> protofilaments that constitute cylindrical microtubules with outer diameter around  <dig> nm  <cit> . in a. thaliana tubulin subunits are encoded by small gene families, six for α-tubulin  <cit>  and nine for β-tubulin  <cit> . it has been proposed that the function of microtubules is modulated by highly diverse posttranslational modifications of tubulin dimers  <cit> .

a major advance step in understanding the microtubule function is marked by the solution of its structure, based on docking the high-resolution structure of brain tubulin, studied by electron crystallography  <cit> , into lower-resolution microtubule maps imaged by electron cryomicroscopy  <cit> . the microtubular surface displays a surprisingly large number of binding sites, with numerous proteins binding to the outside surface and a multitude of small ligands binding to the inside of microtubules  <cit> . some structural interactions with other molecules including nucleotides, drugs, microtubule-associated proteins  and motor proteins were predicted  <cit> . microtubule models also provide the opportunity to predict the surface location of small antibody epitopes, as well as posttranslationally modified amino acids residues. antibodies with binding sites on microtubule surface make it possible to study interaction between microtubules and interacting proteins, including tubulin modifying enzymes, in resting cells or cells activated by extracellular stimuli. site-directed antibodies can also be used for detection of conformation changes in microtubules due to the presence of flexible tubulin domains  <cit> . in spite of a growing number of available anti-tubulin antibodies, data on location of epitopes on native microtubules outside the c-terminal regions of tubulin subunits are very limited. comparative  modeling makes it possible to predict the structures of proteins with similar sequences  <cit> ; homology modeling of tubulin subunits was used for calculation of discernible differences in tubulin biophysical properties  <cit>  and for a rational design of plant herbicides  <cit> . however, plant microtubule models were, so far, not reported.

previously we have found fixation-dependent exposure of tubulin epitopes in n. tabacum microtubules  <cit> , and phosphorylation of n. tabacum tubulin on tyrosine  <cit> . however, important questions remained unresolved, namely whether or not cellular microtubules can be phosphorylated and what consequences it might have for microtubular integrity. furthermore, the function of microtubules in cells responding to extracellular stimuli might be better understood with more knowledge on how the predictions of β-tubulin epitopes and phosphotyrosine locations derived from microtubule model correlate with their exposure in cells.

here we report on the correlation between localization of small β-tubulin regions on a. thaliana microtubule protofilament model and their exposure on cortical microtubules in cells.

RESULTS
epitope mapping
brain tubulin, which can be prepared to a very high degree of purity, is a useful source for epitope mapping. previous experiments have shown that antibodies tu- <dig>  <cit>  and tub  <dig>   <cit>  recognize epitopes in the c-terminal structural domain of porcine brain β-tubulin, while antibody  <dig> d <dig> recognizes epitope in the n-terminal region of the molecule  <cit> . it is known that specific chemical proteolysis  of aspartic-proline bonds generates a small number of proteolytic fragments in tubulin dimers  <cit> . we therefore analysed by immunoblotting porcine brain β-tubulin fragments after formic acid cleavage, using anti-β-tubulin antibodies with known epitope location as markers. β-tubulin has two aspartic-proline bonds at positions β31- <dig> and β304- <dig>   <cit> . formic acid cleavage generates  <dig> fragments denoted β <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig>  β1+β <dig> and β1+β <dig>  as outlined in figure 1a. the subunits were effectively separated by electrophoresis , and the β-tubulin subunit was isolated from gel by electroelution . when purified β-tubulin was subjected to formic acid proteolysis, fragments β1+β <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig> were discernible after staining the blotted proteins with sypro ruby protein blot stain . antibody 18d <dig>  raised against peptide β1- <dig>  served as a marker of the β1+β <dig> fragment , antibody tu- <dig> recognizing an epitope in the region β81- <dig> served as a marker of the β <dig> fragment , and antibody tu- <dig> recognizing an epitope in the region β426- <dig> served as a marker of the β <dig> fragment . immunoblotting with tub  <dig>  antibody revealed reactivity with both β <dig> and β1+β <dig> fragments . this indicates that the corresponding epitope is located in the region β305- <dig>  antibody tu- <dig> also reacted with both β <dig> and β1+β <dig> fragments .

peptide scans of immobilized overlapping peptides were used for a more accurate epitope location on a. thaliana β-tubulin. two peptide scans were selected covering the regions β1- <dig>  and β171- <dig>  in β-tubulin  <dig> . results of immunostaining with the antibodies are shown in figure  <dig>  using this approach the epitopes were located in the following β-tubulin regions: β1- <dig> , β81- <dig> , β426- <dig> , β426- <dig>  and β436- <dig> . the comparison of epitope sequences, recognized by antibodies, with corresponding consensus sequences derived from all β-tubulin isotypes of a. thaliana is shown in table  <dig>  these data demonstrate that epitopes recognized by antibodies 18d <dig>  tu- <dig> and tu-12/tub  <dig>  are highly conserved and are present in all β-tubulin isotypes. less conserved is the c-terminal region, β436- <dig>  where the epitope recognized by antibody tu- <dig> is located. collectively taken, the data demonstrate that the identified β-tubulin epitopes are conserved and present in a. thaliana β-tubulins.

* a. thaliana consensus β-tubulin sequences were generated from a. thaliana sequences for tbb <dig> , tbb <dig> , tbb <dig> , tbb <dig> , tbb <dig> , tbb <dig> , tbb <dig>  and tbb <dig>  using vector nti advance programme . swiss-prot accession numbers are in parentheses. identical amino acid positions are underlined. amino acid residues exposed on inner or outer side of microtubule wall are in bold.

location of β-tubulin epitopes on a model of a. thaliana microtubule protofilaments and in cells
the position of tubulin dimers in microtubule wall is known for brain tubulin  <cit> . homology modeling of a. thaliana microtubules revealed that epitopes 18d <dig> and tu- <dig> are exposed to the lumen of microtubules, whereas epitopes for antibodies tu-12/tub  <dig>  and tu- <dig> are on the external side of microtubules exposed to cytoplasm. exposures of the epitopes on a. thaliana microtubule protofilaments are depicted in figure  <dig>  amino acids that were expected to be exposed on microtubular surface are highlighted in table  <dig> 

to verify the predicted location of epitopes on microtubules, immunofluorescence experiments were performed on fixed and unfixed detergent-extracted samples prepared from a. thaliana seedlings. all tested anti-β-tubulin antibodies stained microtubules in aldehyde-fixed a. thaliana seedlings. the antibodies decorated typical microtubule structures appearing during the cell cycle . the antibodies stained microtubules along their whole length, and no differences among individual antibodies were detected. tu- <dig> failed to stain microtubules on unfixed detergent-extracted cells, in contrast to other antibodies that did stain all microtubule structures. staining of interphase cortical microtubules in fixed and unfixed a. thaliana epidermal cells of primary roots under different fixation conditions is demonstrated for antibodies 18d <dig> and tu- <dig> . the absence of reactivity with tu- <dig> could not be attributed to the lack of microtubules, since it was still possible to visualize microtubules by polyclonal anti-tubulin antibody . the reactivity of antibodies with a. thaliana microtubules are summarized in table  <dig>  these data demonstrate that epitopes tu-12/tub  <dig>  and tu- <dig>  located in the c-terminal structural domain of β-tubulin and predicted to be on the microtubule surface, are indeed available for antibody staining in unfixed plant cells. on the other hand, tu- <dig> epitope exposed to the microtubule lumen was not accessible for antibody binding in unfixed microtubules, but fixation made the exposure of that epitope possible. interestingly, the 18d <dig> epitope, located on the very n-terminal end of β-tubulin and also predicted to be exposed towards the microtubular lumen, was available for antibody binding in unfixed preparations.

exposure of phosphotyrosines on microtubules
the screening, by means of ds visualizer program, of tyrosine residues exposed in a. thaliana microtubule model disclosed that only tyrosines  <dig> and  <dig> out of the  <dig> tyrosine residues present in consensus sequence of all β-tubulin isotypes were completely exposed on the outer side of microtubule surface. besides, tyrosines at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  present only on some β-tubulin isotypes, were found to be part of the flexible c-terminal tail. thus, they too are exposed on the microtubular external side .

to test whether or not plant microtubules can carry phosphorylation on tubulin tyrosine residues exposed on the outer side of microtubules, we have performed double-label staining experiments on unfixed detergent-extracted a. thaliana microtubules using polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody  and monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody . staining was also performed on seedlings pretreated for  <dig> min with  <dig>  mm sodium orthovanadate. this compound is a potent inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases, and proteins are therefore retained in their phosphorylated state. while the signal detected with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody in untreated samples was low , staining was markedly enhanced if the cells were pretreated with sodium orthovanadate . double-label staining with anti-β-tubulin antibody confirmed that microtubules were preserved , and phosphotyrosine labeling correlated with cortical microtubules in interphase cells . similar staining pattern with p-tyr was observed when untreated or sodium orthovanadate-treated samples were fixed before immunostaining. moreover, clear staining of mitotic spindles was also observed in fixed samples pretreated with sodium orthovanadate . these data suggest that plant microtubules can be modified by tyrosine phosphorylation and that tyrosine residues located in the c-terminal region of β-tubulin isotypes, exposed on microtubule surface, could be phosphorylated.

discussion
homology modeling has been used for specification of some biophysical properties of tubulin isotypes  <cit> , as well as for a rational design of microtubule inhibitors  <cit> . we made use of this approach to predict the exposure of β-tubulin epitopes and tyrosine residues on the surface of a. thaliana microtubules. here, we report on three novel findings:  identification of phylogenetically conserved β-tubulin epitopes recognized by well-established monoclonal antibodies.  docking of epitopes into a. thaliana microtubule model and confirmation of predicted localization by staining of cellular microtubules.  prediction of tyrosine exposure on the outer side of a. thaliana microtubule wall and experimental verification of microtubule phosphorylation on tyrosine in cells.

we confirmed the localization of epitopes for antibodies tu- <dig>   <cit>  and tu- <dig>   <cit> , previously determined on porcine brain tubulin, using a. thaliana overlapping β-tubulin peptides. we improved the accuracy of localization for epitopes recognized by antibodies 18d <dig> , tub  <dig>   and tu- <dig> . out of this panel, antibodies tu- <dig>  tu- <dig> and tub <dig>  are commercially available and are supplied by various vendors. whereas the amino acid sequences in the regions β1- <dig> and β81- <dig> are highly homologous in all eight β-tubulin isotypes of a. thaliana, there are differences in the c-terminal regions of β-tubulin isotypes demonstrated by their amino acid alignment . this indicates that the distribution of epitopes recognized by antibodies tu- <dig>  tub  <dig>  and tu- <dig> might be restricted just to some isotypes. identification of minimal peptides that bind to the antibodies is necessary before making final conclusions about the distribution of epitopes on individual β-tubulin isotypes. on the other hand, antibodies 18d <dig> and tu- <dig> represent general probes that ought to recognize all a. thaliana isotypes. as known posttranslational modifications of β-tubulin isotypes are located in the c-terminal domains  <cit> , modifications should not impair the reactivity of these antibodies. 18d <dig> and tu- <dig> could be therefore useful for detection of all β-tubulin charge variants  generated by combination of different β-tubulin isotypes and their posttranslational modifications.

since the sequence alignment of porcine and a. thaliana β-tubulin isotypes revealed approximately 85% sequence identity, it is reasonable to assume that homology modeling based on known structure of bovine brain tubulin  <cit>  combined with the high resolution model of microtubules  <cit>  produces a model of a. thaliana microtubule protofilaments acceptable with a high degree of confidence. this enabled to position the β-tubulin epitopes into a. thaliana microtubule wall, and to localize those amino acid residues that are exposed on the inner or outer surface of microtubules.

while decoration of unfixed cellular microtubules was in good agreement with the predicted epitope docking for antibodies tu- <dig>  tu- <dig>  tub  <dig>  and tu- <dig>  decoration of unfixed microtubules with antibody 18d <dig> was surprising. the 18d <dig> epitope in protofilament model was positioned in the microtubule interior facing the lumen, so one would expect that it will be obscured on unfixed microtubules. in addition, it has been demonstrated previously that microinjected 18d <dig> antibody did not decorate microtubules in animal cho-k <dig> cells, if the cells were prior to fixation extracted with  <dig> % triton x- <dig> in microtubule stabilizing buffer  <cit> . when taxol was excluded during preparation of unfixed samples, staining of microtubules with 18d <dig> antibody was reduced . an altering effect of taxol on the arrangement of tubulin protofilaments was reported  <cit> . we thus propose that the exposure of 18d <dig> epitope on unfixed a. thaliana microtubules might be caused by conformation changes generated by taxol used for stabilization of microtubules. interestingly, only three out of the ten amino acids of the 18d <dig> epitope are exposed on the interior surface of microtubules ; this indicates that the n-terminal β-tubulin region is important for antibody binding to microtubules.

on the other hand, finding that epitopes 18d <dig> and tu- <dig>  located on the inner site of microtubule wall, appeared after fixation of microtubules was no surprise. it is well documented that different fixation conditions influence the exposure of tubulin epitopes both in animal  <cit>  and plant microtubules  <cit> . since tubulin subunits have flexible domains  <cit> , even "mild" fixation with  <dig> % formaldehyde can affect the exposure of epitopes on microtubules  <cit> . it was suggested that changes in the conformation of tubulin by fixation influence the interaction between protofilaments, and can consequently lead to an exposure of epitopes in the lumen of microtubules, as was demonstrated for acetylated lysine α <dig>  <cit> . conformation changes in protofilaments were reported after binding of the motor proteins to microtubules  <cit> . our results strengthen the hypothesis that the way samples are prepared can substantially influence the results obtained in cells, and a good deal of caution must be used when predicting locations inferred from microtubule models.

previously we have shown that plant tubulin is phosphorylated on tyrosine  <cit> ; however, data on tyrosine phosphorylation of microtubules in plant cells are missing. homology modeling in a. thaliana revealed that tyrosines in the c-terminal region of β-tubulin isotypes  are exposed on the microtubule outer side and might therefore become likely targets for tyrosine kinases. in the case of α-tubulin isotypes, homology modeling disclosed that out of the total of  <dig> tyrosine residues only the c-terminal tyrosine α <dig> was completely exposed on the surface of microtubules . to verify that tyrosines on polymerized microtubules are indeed phosphorylated, immunofluorescence experiments were carried out with unfixed cells. the results showed that the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody decorated microtubules. while the steady-state level of microtubule phosphorylation on tyrosine was low, phosphorylation of microtubules was clearly visible in cells pretreated with sodium orthovanadate, a factor which shifts the equilibrium to the phosphorylation state. although one cannot exclude that the tyrosines partly buried in the microtubule wall are exposed to phosphorylation after binding of kinases to microtubules, it seems reasonable to assume that phosphorylation on tyrosines could occur in the c-terminal regions of polymerized tubulins. since immunoblotting after 2d-page separation of isolated n. tabacum tubulin clearly confirmed phosphorylation of both subunits  <cit> , we suggest that β-tubulin as well as α-tubulin isotypes in a. thaliana microtubules might be phosphorylated. maps could also be phosphorylated on tyrosine in sodium orthovanadate-treated cells. however, maps are less abundant than tubulin in microtubule preparations isolated from plant extracts, and show usually punctuate localization in cortical a. thaliana microtubules  <cit> . in contrast, we have observed a uniform staining along the microtubules with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody in fixed cells. this indicates that anti-phosphotyrosine antibody might stain tubulin. however, further studies are necessary to confirm this assumption.

it is well established that the c-terminal domains of tubulins in polymerized microtubules can be posttranslationally modified  <cit>  and bind maps  <cit> . the physiological significance of tyrosine phosphorylation of microtubules is unknown, but it can possibly modulate the binding of maps or motor proteins. in addition, it might modulate the function of microtubules in response to extracellular stimuli. cellular microtubules can provide a matrix upon which the signaling molecules are arrayed  <cit> . tyrosine phosphorylation of tubulin in microtubule polymer might affect the cell signaling by enhancing the src-homology  <dig>  domain-mediated interaction between microtubules and signaling molecules. syk-dependent phosphorylation of microtubules during activation of b-lymphocytes was described  <cit> . the syk kinase belongs to protein tyrosine kinases of syk/zap family, and tubulin is one of the proteins in animal cells identified as a likely substrate for syk in vivo  <cit> . it is worth mentioning that zap-like kinases were identified by bioinformatics homology analysis in plant cells . recent experiments with tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors identified tyrosine phosphorylation as an important factor in overall organization of microtubules in a. thaliana root cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
using homology modeling we have generated an arabidopsis thaliana microtubule protofilament model that served for the prediction of surface exposure of five β-tubulin epitopes, as well as tyrosine residues. peptide scans newly disclosed the position of epitopes detected by antibodies 18d <dig> , tub <dig>   and tu- <dig> . experimental verification of obtained results by immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the exposure of epitopes was dependent on fixation. moreover, homology modeling showed that only tyrosines located in the c-terminal region of β-tubulins  are exposed on the microtubule outer side. immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed tyrosine phosphorylation of microtubules in plant cells, and β-tubulins could thus be one of the targets for tyrosine kinases. tyrosine phosphorylation of microtubules may affect their capability to interact with associated proteins in cells responding to extracellular stimuli. the data also demonstrate that however useful the homology modeling may be for the prediction of amino acid exposure on microtubule surface, it has to be corroborated by experimental verification.
