BACKGROUND
recent advances in our ability to mathematically investigate the dynamic complexity of biomolecular systems, have created inroads into these systems. examples include natural systems, such as the lactose  <cit>  and tryptophan  <cit>  operon, and synthetic systems such as the oscillator  <cit> , logic and gates  <cit>  and toggle switch  <cit> . in the present paper, we examine the dynamic behavior of the tetracycline  operon. although some studies have examined the interactions of different parts of the tet operon  <cit> , to our knowledge there is no mathematical model that describes all the biomolecular interactions of this intriguing system. the tet operon is found naturally in bacteria where it confers resistance to antibiotic tetracycline .

tc used to be one of the most common antibiotics for treating bacterial infections. it functions by binding the bacterial ribosome , thereby impeding the process of translation  and causing cell death  <cit> . due to its low cost, tc was used excessively. because of the excessive use, bacteria developed resistance to it.

already in  <dig>  there was evidence that escherichia coli  bacteria had developed resistance to tc, but the exact resistance mechanism was not clear  <cit> . to date, four resistance mechanisms have been identified  <cit> . these mechanisms are associated with a) active efflux of tc out of the cell, b) rib protection from tc, c) rrna mutation and d) tc inactivation. in the present work, we investigate the mechanism of active transport of tc out of the cell, whereby bacteria under attack by tc, quickly produce a membrane protein that pumps tc out of the cell. this resistance mechanism relies on the tet operon  <cit> . several tc resistance determinants have evolved  <cit> . this work refers to class b  tc resistance determinant. a qualitative model of the tet operon is shown in figure  <dig> 

the tet operon comprises of two genes, teta and tetr. the first encodes teta, a transporter protein which removes tc from the cell. the tetr gene encodes tetr which binds to the operators, acts as a repressor and inhibits the expression of both genes in the absence of tc. moreover, this operon consists of three promoters and two operators. one promoter belongs to the teta gene while the other two belong to the tetr gene. the two operators control the expression of the two genes. the promoters and the operators overlap, significantly increasing the complexity of this biological switch.

in the absence of tc, tetr binds as a dimer  to both operators. tetr <dig> binding to the operators results in the repression of gene expression. when tc enters the cell, it binds to rib preventing protein synthesis. importantly, it also binds to the tetr <dig> repressor, with high affinity, causing a conformational change in the dna binding region. this results in tetr <dig> unbinding from the operator sites. once tetr <dig> has dissociated from the operator sites, gene expression is turned on producing teta and tetr. subsequently, tc is removed from the cell through the active transport mechanism mediated by teta. after the expulsion of tc from the cell, tetr <dig> protein binds the operator sites again, turning off the expression of the two genes  <cit> .

it is interesting to note that expression of genes is activated only in the presence of the antibiotic tc. this is a remarkable cost-effective mechanism, a feature that has made the molecular components  of this system attractive for the design and development of a gamut of synthetic gene networks  <cit> . the molecular elements of this operon are widely used as parts of biological switches, taking advantage of the fast and robust switching. more specifically, the expression of desired proteins is placed under the transcriptional control of the tet components, where protein production can be efficiently turned on and off in response to the presence or the absence of tc.

herein, we formulate a mathematical model of the naturally occurring tet operon based on experimental findings. our model incorporates all the biomolecular interactions of this system including those involved in dimerization, transcription, translation, degradation, repression and induction. the model represents each elementary biomolecular interaction with biochemical reactions.

we use a hybrid, stochastic-discrete and stochastic-continuous algorithm to simulate the behavior of the tet operon in order to understand how it responds to various disturbances  <cit> . the use of the stochastic algorithm allows us to consider single cell time lines as well as variability across different cells. lastly, a sensitivity analysis of the binding strength of tc for tetr <dig> and of tetr <dig> for the operator sites is performed, providing mechanistic insight into the functionality of this system.

model description
how to best model biological systems is still an open question. here we adhere to monod's postulate that biological complexity can be reduced to networks of biomolecular interactions  <cit> . our model consists of  <dig> species and  <dig> biochemical reactions which capture the biomolecular interactions occurring in the tet operon. the entire reaction network is supplied in table  <dig> and can be found online at http://www.synbioss.org/. synbioss is an open source software suite for modeling biological networks  <cit> .

the definition of the species that participate in the tet operon reaction network and the kinetic constants of the reactions are found in table  <dig> and table  <dig> respectively. in what follows, we provide a description of the salient features of this operon. we explain also the reactions that we use to describe the biomolecular processes taking place in this system.

as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the tet operon is composed of  <dig> genes, tetr and teta. these give rise to two proteins, tetr and teta. let us start with the interactions of tetr. tetr <dig>  the dimer form of tetr, is involved in inhibiting gene expression in the absence of tc  <cit> . we model the dimerization of the tetr as a second order reversible reaction .

tetr <dig> protein represses the system by binding to the operator sites of the tet operon. we designate these two operators as teto <dig> and teto <dig>  the binding of the repressor protein to the teto <dig> shuts down the expression of both the two genes. on the other hand, the binding to the teto <dig> impedes the expression of the teta gene and only down regulates the expression of the tetr gene  <cit> . there is no indication of cooperativity between these two operator sites  <cit> . we represent the binding of tetr <dig> to the operator sites, teto <dig> and teto <dig>  as a second order bimolecular reaction .

tetr <dig> can bind to non-specific dna  sites as well  <cit> . even though the affinity of the repressor protein for the nsdna is low, there are about  <dig> million nsdna sites in the e. coli genome thereby significantly increasing the probability of tetr <dig> being bound to nsdna. these non-specific binding interactions are captured by the reaction  <dig> 

it is noteworthy that the affinity of the repressor for teto <dig> is about  <dig> times higher than for teto <dig>  <cit> . it has been theorized that this mechanism is used by e. coli to avoid fortuitous expression of the teta gene. an unexpected decrease in the number of tetr protein would favor the repression of the teta gene first, until more tetr proteins are produced and expression of the two genes is inhibited again. in any case, the repressor shuts down the expression of the teta gene first and soonafter the expression of the tetr gene  <cit> .

the diffusion of the tc into the cell is represented by a first order reaction capturing the effective rate at which tc enters the cell . we should note that although tc is certain to bind other targets in the cell, in our model we only regard an effective tc amount that interacts only with the tet operon. once tc diffuses into the cell, it binds to a metal ion, m, yielding the complex m-tc  <cit> . for simplicity, in our model, we neglect the formation of this complex which occurs almost instantaneously. subsequently, tc binds to the repressor  with high affinity. upon binding, tetr <dig> undergoes a conformational change that reduces dramatically its affinity for the operators  <cit> . the tc binding to tetr <dig> is coded as a second order bimolecular reaction. each tetr <dig> protein harbors two binding sites. the two tc molecules bind in succession, and without cooperativity, to yield tetr2:tc <dig>  <cit> . these interactions are described by reactions 6- <dig> 

when the operator sites are free from tetr <dig>  transcription will occur. transcription can be separated into three stages: initiation, elongation and termination. in order for transcription initiation to occur, the holoenzyme, which is composed of sigma factor and rna polymerase , is recruited to the promoter sites. there it forms a closed complex  <cit> . this entire process is effectively modeled as a second order bimolecular reaction . after the formation of the closed complex, the dna double helix is unwound forming an open complex . once the open complex has been formed, rnap starts to transcribe each single nucleotide and the sigma factor is released from the holoenzyme. the transcription of the first nucleotide is considered a first order reaction . subsequently, rnap moves along the dna transcribing each nucleotide independently of the others  <cit> . this process could be modeled as a series of reactions, each of them representing the transcription of each single nucleotide. considering the reaction times as exponentially distributed events, we integrate all these reactions in a single reaction that represents a gamma distributed event   <cit> . the scale parameter is equal to the rate of the transcription of each single nucleotide while the shape parameter equals the number of nucleotides that are transcribed.

as shown in figure  <dig>  there are three promoter binding sites in the tet operon where the holoenzyme is recruited. we designate these binding sites as tetpr <dig>  tetpr <dig> and tetpa. tetpr <dig> and tetpr <dig> regulate the tetr gene whereas tetpa controls the teta gene. if an rnap is recruited to one of the three sites, it prohibits another rnap from being recruited to one of the other two  <cit> . furthermore, the affinity of rnap for each of the three sites is different  <cit> . thus, we include three different cases  to capture all the different possible ways that transcription initiation can occur. we model the first case  using the reactions 14- <dig> 

reactions 14- <dig> depict the transcription of the tetr gene when an rnap is recruited to the tetpr <dig> site. the tetpr <dig> site accounts for approximately 5% of the total mrna transcripts of the tetr gene  <cit> . in table  <dig>  the brackets indicate the promoter site from which transcription initiation occurs. in reaction  <dig>  complex refers to the dna molecule when all of the promoter sites and the operators are free. when all the sites are free, they form a single, contiguous complex that rnap can bind to and start transcription. the formation of this complex is described in reaction  <dig>  it should be stressed that this reaction has no physical meaning and it serves as an algorithmic trick. to this end, reactions 42- <dig> are the same as forward reactions  <dig> and  <dig> and backward reactions  <dig> and  <dig>  similarly to reactions 14- <dig>  reactions 18- <dig> represent the transcription of tetr gene when rnap binds to the promoter site tetpr <dig> .

tet operon is a tightly regulated system. one of its striking features is that even if the repressor  is bound to the operator teto <dig>  rnap can still be recruited to the promoter tetpr <dig> and start transcription if teto <dig> is free  <cit> . the affinity of rnap for the tetpr <dig> is slightly lower in this case than in the case when both the promoters, teto <dig> and teto <dig>  are free. this mechanism is modeled by reactions 22- <dig> 

similarly to the process of transcription, the process of translation also progresses in three steps: initiation, elongation, and termination. the initiation stage includes the association of mrna with the ribosomal units  and the initiator trna to form the initiation complex  <cit> . this entire process is represented as a first order irreversible reaction . after the initiation complex forms, rib translates the mrna molecule into its protein products  <cit> . the movement of the rib from the ribosome binding site to the coding region along with the release of the mrna molecule are described in reaction  <dig>  the elongation process is integrated, as in the transcription process, in one gamma distributed reaction event   <cit> . in this case the scale parameter is equal to the rate of the translation of each single codon and the shape parameter equals the number of amino acids that are produced. the species utilized in transcription and translation  are finally freed to participate in these processes again. the translation mechanisms are shown in reactions 25- <dig> 

we use the same pattern of reactions to model the expression of the teta gene as we did to model tetr expression. in this case, there is only one promoter site, namely tetpa, where transcription initiation can take place . using a reaction formalism to capture transcription and translation we come up with reactions 28- <dig> 

the proteins as well as the mrnas are degraded during the cell life. mrnas are degraded by ribonuclease enzymes. the protein degradation is catalyzed by proteases  <cit> . the degradation of both the mrna and proteins is modeled as simple first order reactions . reactions  <dig> and  <dig> refer to the degradation of tetr <dig> protein. tetr <dig> can be degraded when it is free  or when it is bound by tc . to our knowledge, there is no study that demonstrates teta degradation. therefore, we assume that teta is not degraded, a plausible assumption for any membrane protein. however, in our model teta gets diluted due to cell division. further, we consider tc degradation .

finally, reaction  <dig> captures the removal of tc from the cell. as mentioned above, the exclusion of tc from the cell occurs through a process controlled by the teta protein. this process is energy dependent and is driven by a ph gradient across the membrane  <cit> . the removal of one tc molecule is coupled by the influx of one proton in the cell  <cit> . eventually, teta remains in the membrane of the cell while tc is pumped out of the cell. there is evidence that teta protein can exist as a dimer or even as a multimer in the cell, but this is still unclear  <cit> . for the sake of simplicity, in our formulation we consider teta to exist as a monomer.

model parameters
in table  <dig>  we present the values of the parameters for the model. the tet operon is one of the best studied bacterial gene networks. as such, there is an atypical wealth of parameters on the strength of biomolecular interactions. therefore, most of the equilibrium constants that we used in our model have been obtained through experimental procedures. the relevant literature references are presented in table  <dig> 

a concern may be legitimately posed that in most cases strengths of biomolecular interactions are measured in vitro, that is outside of the pertinent biological context. indeed, this is a quintessential challenge faced by quantitative biology. this is a reason we chose to study the sensitivity of the operon behavior to changes in the values of important parameters.

in most cases of the reversible reactions, only the equilibrium constant is actually available. then the kinetic constant of the forward reaction is assumed and the reverse reaction kinetic constant is subsequently calculated through the equilibrium constant.

having in mind that the tetr dimerization equilibrium constant is greater than 107m- <dig>  <cit> , we consider it equal to 108m- <dig>   <cit> . regarding reaction  <dig>  we set a reaction rate equal to  <dig> aiming to make it a very fast reaction.

as regards the binding of tc to tetr <dig>  it was modeled based on  <cit> . more specifically, the kinetic constant of the binding of the first tc molecule to tetr <dig>  is twice the kinetic constant of the binding of the second tc molecule to tetr <dig>  consequently, the kinetic constant of the unbinding of the second tc molecule from tetr <dig> is twice the kinetic constant of the unbinding of the first tc molecule.

another choice we made was on the degradation rate of tetr <dig>  which is chosen with  <dig> hours half time. the rate at which tc is degraded is assumed to be equal to the degradation rate of tc in distilled water  <cit> . the mrna degradation rate was adjusted such that  <dig> protein molecules per mrna transcript are produced  <cit> .

regarding the affinity of rnap for the tetpa promoter, it has been shown to be approximately nine times higher than the combined tetpr promoters. to facilitate this, the total affinity of the rnap for the two tetpr promoters is set equal to 1/ <dig> of the affinity of rnap for tetpa. tetpr <dig> promoter accounts for 95% of the total mrna while the remaining 5% imputes to tetpr <dig>  therefore, the binding strength of rnap to tetpr <dig> is  <dig> times higher than the binding strength of rnap to tetpr <dig>  moreover, when tetr <dig> is bound to teto <dig>  the expression of tetpr <dig> is decreased by 16% and thus, the corresponding kinetic constant is equal to 84% of the case where teto <dig> is free  <cit> . concerning the open complex  formation kinetic parameter, it is assumed to be equal for all the three promoters.

in general, both the transcription and the translation rates vary significantly. in our formulation, we postulate that the transcription rate is  <dig> nucleotides whereas the translation rate is  <dig> codons per second  <cit> .

stochastic simulations of systems with chemical reactions
biological systems are generally not at the thermodynamic limit. they are composed of molecules, such as promoters and operators, that participate in the biological processes in low copy numbers  <cit> . the result is that randomness becomes important. deterministic approaches cannot take into account this randomness in the behavior of these systems. stochastic approaches are therefore needed  <cit> . thus far, several computational methods have been developed that take into account the effects of fluctuations due to the stochasticity  <cit> .

the first attempt to develop an algorithm that allows for discreteness and stochasticity in systems of chemical reactions was made by gillespie  <cit> . he developed an algorithm, called stochastic simulation algorithm, that describes accurately the dynamics of a well-mixed system which experiences large fluctuations due to the small number of individual reacting molecules. although this method can be used specifically to simulate systems with inherent stochasticity, it is inefficient because it simulates each single reaction event separately.

for the purposes of this study, we use a hybrid, stochastic-discrete and stochastic-continuous algorithm to simulate the tet operon behavior  <cit> . hybrid simulations have been successfully used before to simulate biological systems  <cit> . the algorithm that we use here is available with open source licenses at http://hysss.sourceforge.net/ <cit> , with a matlab graphics user interface , and at http://www.synbioss.org/ <cit> , with an ms windows gui. this algorithm divides the system into two subsets. one subset involves the fast reactions that occur in the system. the reactions of this subset are considered continuous markov processes and the evolution is computed using the chemical langenvin equation. the other subset constitutes the slow reactions of the system. reactions that belong to this subset are handled as jump markov processes. in order for a reaction to belong to a subset, two criteria must be satisfied. these criteria are associated with the probabilistic reaction rate  and the number of molecules that participate in the reaction.

underlying assumptions and conditions
the cell is considered to be an isolated, well stirred, homogeneous reactor. it is also considered that the cell volume is equal to 10- <dig> l and increases exponentially. cell division is assumed to occur every  <dig> ±  <dig> minutes. the exact time for each cell division is randomly chosen from a gaussian distribution whose mean is set to  <dig> minutes. moreover, we hypothesize that during the cell division, the number of molecules of the proteins, mrnas, and tc is halved. in order to simplify our model, we do not take into consideration the tc binding to the rib assuming that the intracellular tc amount that is used here is the effective amount that the tet operon has to remove from the cell. furthermore, the diffusion of intracellular tc out of the cell is considered negligible compared to the tc removal from the cell by teta. finally, the conditions of the cell, such as ph and temperature, are considered to be constant during the simulations.

for each single simulation,  <dig>  trials  were carried out. in what follows, we present not only the average behavior of the  <dig>  cells, but also the behavior of single cells. it is important to stress that the use of stochastic algorithms allows for exploring single cell behaviors and variations across the  <dig>  cells. this would not be possible with the use of deterministic approaches. the initial conditions that were used in the simulations are  <dig> rib,  <dig> rnap,  <dig> promoters ,  <dig> operators , and 4· <dig> nsdna sites. even though the actual number of rib and rnap that exist in the e. coli is higher  <cit> , we consider that only a small fraction of the total number is available to this operon.

RESULTS
simulation of the tet operon behavior
the first set of simulations explores the steady state of the system. according to experimental observations, at steady state, and in the absence of tc, there is no intracellular teta and the amount of intracellular tetr is small. this is a convenient attribute of the tet operon. the few tetr proteins require only a small number of tc molecules to induce the gene expression  <cit> . moreover, teta should not be produced in the absence of tc because large teta amounts can lead to cell death  <cit> . teta is a membrane protein that pumps tc out of the cell while pumping protons from the periplasm into the cytoplasm. if teta is present, even in the absence of tc, transport of protons through the membrane may result in the collapse of the membrane potential and cell death.

in order to investigate the steady state of the system, we conducted a set of simulations in which neither teta nor tetr initially exist in the cell. gene expression is therefore allowed to take place producing tetr which inhibits gene expression thus bringing the system to the steady state . the results for both the average behavior of the system and the behavior of a single cell are shown in figure  <dig>  concerning the average behavior of tetr and tetr <dig> , they reach a maximum of about  <dig> and  <dig> molecules per cell respectively and approximately after  <dig> hours reach steady state. at steady state, there are approximately  <dig> tetr and  <dig> tetr <dig> molecule in the cell. for teta , we observe an average initial production of  <dig> molecules, whereas after  <dig> hours there is virtually no teta left in any cell due to dilution. the initial pulse is the result of no initial repression by tetr.

it is important to notice that there is a difference between the average amount of teta and tetr. this is because the promoter of the teta gene is approximately nine times stronger than the combined tetr promoters  <cit> . this implies that the teta gene expression is very high compared to the tetr gene when both of the genes are expressed. moreover, it should be kept in mind that some of the tetr proteins are bound to nsdna as well as to tc, making the amount of free tetr smaller.

interestingly, looking at the single cell behavior  we observe large fluctuations in the number of tetr and tetr <dig> molecules. according to figures 2b and 2d, the fluctuations of tetr and tetr <dig> reach a maximum of  <dig> and  <dig> molecules respectively. at steady state, the maximum tetr and tetr <dig> amount observed across the  <dig>  cells is  <dig> and  <dig> molecules respectively . it is worth mentioning that even though the average number of tetr and tetr <dig> is small , there are cells that incorporate tetr <dig> molecules whose amount fluctuates around high values. however, these cells are only a few and therefore, the average amount of tetr and tetr <dig> is kept small. apparently, in this case the average behavior of the cell is not representative of the single cell behavior and this necessitates the use of stochastic algorithms. had we used a deterministic approach, fluctuations in the behavior of tetr <dig> could not be established.

concerning the teta, in the case of a single cell , we note that a maximum of  <dig> molecules is reached. subsequently, the number of teta molecules becomes zero after  <dig>  hours. at steady state, the maximum number of teta molecules observed across the  <dig>  cells is  <dig> . it should be underlined that cells with high intracellular teta amounts at steady state cannot survive due to the membrane collapse.

importantly, these results are consistent with experimental observations, in that not only the number of intracellular teta molecules is zero at steady state  <cit> , but also in that there is only a small amount of free tetr  <cit> . we have thus established the steady state conditions of tetr and teta in the cell.

our next step is to test the behavior of the system when a pulse of tc is administered to the cell. a set of simulations was carried out varying the number of tc molecules administered to the e. coli cells. more specifically, we start with the system at steady state and after  <dig> hours, a pulse of a wide range of tc molecules  is administered to each cell. administration of different tc amounts results in the production of different teta amounts. the results are portrayed in figure  <dig> 

focusing on the teta amount at time  <dig> hours, we notice that the larger the quantity of administered tc, the faster is the response of the system. this is pursuant to the fact that the tet operon is a well regulated system which responds fast to the addition of tc. furthermore, we observe a nearly linear correlation between the administered tc and the intracellular teta amount. an approximately linear dependence between teta and non-toxic administered tc amount has been observed before  <cit> . given that in our case the administered tc amount is non-toxic, this result is in agreement with the results by korpela et al. it is worth stressing that after the removal of tc from the cell, the system returns again to its original steady state. the time that the system needs to reach the steady state depends on the number of teta molecules. the higher the number of teta molecules, the longer it takes for the system to reach the basal state.

another important fact is that even with the administration of a small tc amount , the gene expression is turned on automatically in order for the tc to be removed before causing cell death. this is in line with experimental observations which suggests that induction takes place even with very low, non-toxic tc concentrations  <cit> .

in addition to investigating teta levels in response to tc treatment, we also investigate tetr levels at these different tc concentrations. the average number of intracellular free  tetr <dig> molecules practically remains constant regardless of the number of administered tc molecules. this is an interesting result, especially when contrasted to the teta behavior. this trend is shown in figure  <dig> 

as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the average number of tetr <dig> molecules decreases slightly when tc is administered to the cells. this decrease is caused by the binding of tc to the free tetr <dig> molecules. however, shortly after the decrease on the tetr <dig> amount, an increase to the tetr <dig> amount is observed which comes from the induction of the system which in turn causes the production of many tetr <dig> molecules. after this increase in the tetr <dig> amount, the system finally reverts to its steady state. figure  <dig> indicates that the higher the amount of administered tc, the larger the decrease of the tetr <dig> amount and the longer the time that the system needs to go back to its steady state.

the dynamics of the intracellular tc when different tc amounts are administered to the cell are also explored. figure  <dig> shows the average intracellular tc amount for the  <dig> different cases. as expected, the average number of intracellular tc molecules increases with the number of administered tc molecules.

in figure  <dig> we show the maximum value of the mean and the variation  of the number of teta  and intracellular tc  molecules for different amounts of administered tc. as evident in figure 6a, the maximum teta amount produced by each cell upon tc administration varies significantly. it is important to notice that even though the maximum average value of the teta amount in the cell is non-zero for all the  <dig> cases, in the first  <dig> cases  there are cells that produce no teta protein upon tc administration. these cells would probably not survive from the tc administration since expression of the resistance protein was not activated and consequently tc was not removed.

analyzing figure 6b, the variation of the number of intracellular tc molecules seems to be smaller than the variation of the teta molecules. furthermore, we note that the higher the number of administered tc molecules, the higher the variation of the intracellular tc molecules. it is important to remark that cells whose intracellular tc amounts lie in the higher regions is less probable to survive while cells with small intracellular tc amounts is most probable to circumvent the attack of tc to their transcriptional machinery.

in experimental conditions, e. coli usually experience prolonged exposure to tc. thus, motivated by the need to understand the behavior of the tet operon when in a solution with the antibiotic tc, we performed a set of simulations where tc is constantly administered to the cells. the system is initially at steady state. then, after  <dig> hours,  <dig> tc molecules are administered continuously. this is tantamount to having a constant concentration of external tc equal to  <dig> ·10- <dig> m under the following assumptions: 1) the volume of the cells is negligible compared to the volume of the solution, 2) the total tc amount is ultimately uptaken by the cells, 3) the number of cells in the solution is 108/ml. the average behavior of the system  as well as the behavior of a single cell  are illustrated in figure  <dig> 

notably, even with a constant high amount of external tc, the tet operon does not allow high levels of internal tc. this is attributed to the production of high teta amounts which remove tc from the cell, thus boosting the performance of the tet operon. it should be kept in mind that the intracellular tc amount is also decreased because of the degradation and the cell division in which the number of tc molecules is halved every  <dig> ±  <dig> minutes. overall, with constant tc administration, teta expression reaches steady state at the population level. at this state, the teta levels become constant and the intracellular tc levels are significantly lower than the extracellular ones.

as far as the single cell behavior is concerned, it appears to be similar to the average behavior. regarding the tc amount in the single cell , again after the tc administration we observe a peak value of approximately  <dig> molecules. subsequently, the tc amount decreases and finally fluctuates around the value of about  <dig> molecules. overall, the tc amount at steady state varies from  <dig> to  <dig> molecules among the cells . as observed previously , the tetr <dig> amount of the single cells appears to fluctuate. this amount among the  <dig>  cells lies in the area of  <dig> and  <dig> molecules . similarly to the average behavior, the single cell behavior with respect to teta molecules shows an initial increase after tc administration. this increase results in fluctuations around the value of  <dig> teta molecules. at steady state, the teta amount observed within the single cells varies between  <dig> and  <dig>  molecules .

as discussed previously, only a small portion  of the total mrna from the tetr gene is transcribed from the tetpr <dig> promoter  <cit> . the remaining originates from the tetpr <dig> promoter. in order to explore the functionality of the tetpr <dig> promoter, we performed a set of simulations in which no tetpr <dig> exists in the system. initially, the system is at steady state and consequently there is neither tc nor teta in the cell. at time equal to  <dig> hours,  <dig> tc molecules are administered to the wild type cells as well as to the cells which lack the promoter tetpr <dig>  the trends of the two systems are provided in figure  <dig> 

importantly, the results of the simulation of the wild type system are the same with the results of the system which lacks the promoter tetpr <dig>  the number of the intracellular tc molecules is the same  in the two systems. in addition, the lack of tetpr <dig> from the tet operon does not appear to affect the amount of the regulatory molecules, tetr, tetr <dig> and teta . we further observed that the total behavior of the system is retained even when the tet operon includes no tetpr <dig> promoter . this indicates that this promoter is not essential in e. coli. it supports the existing hypothesis that this promoter is involved in the tet operon because of its functional importance in other bacteria which carry the tet operon  <cit> . this promoter could also have previously played a role in e. coli, but it may remain only as a genetic artifact.

sensitivity analysis
the tet operon is an excellent biological switch  <cit> . the key features that define its outstanding functionality include high teta expression in the presence of tc combined with no appreciable expression leakiness in the absence of tc. these salient characteristics are attributed to the high affinity of tc for the repressor tetr <dig> and the high affinity of tetr <dig> for the operator sites, teto <dig> and teto <dig>  even though these parameters and the associated processes are not rate limiting steps, they do contribute to the fine tuning of this biological switch.

in order to explore the importance of these features, we performed a sensitivity analysis of our model to examine how the different values of the specific tet operon parameters influence its behavior. in this set of simulations, a pulse of a wide range  of tc molecules is administered to each e. coli cell. with this range, we can investigate the sensitivity of the tet operon even when minimal amounts of tc are administered. we can also understand the changes in the behavior of this operon upon increasing the amount of administered tc.

affinity of tc for tetr2
first, the importance of tc's affinity for tetr <dig> is investigated. as discussed previously, once tc diffuses into the cell, it binds to tetr <dig> with high binding strength   <cit> . this causes rapid induction of the system, and consequently the expression of tetr and teta. in order to check how this binding strength influences the total behavior of the system, a set of simulations was conducted in which the affinity of tc for tetr and tetr <dig> spans two orders of magnitude lower and higher than the nominal value. this could be achieved experimentally by making amino acid substitutions or deletions on tetr <dig>  <cit> , thereby affecting the affinity of tc for tetr <dig>  in our analysis, this is realized by changing the kinetic constants that correspond to this affinity   <dig> and  <dig> times.

results of the simulations are depicted in figure  <dig>  they illustrate the maximum value of the average intracellular teta  and tc  amount when a pulse of various tc amounts is administered to each cell. the various teta levels are the result of the range of administered tc molecules and of different tc affinities for tetr <dig> 

as depicted in figure  <dig>  the system is sensitive to changes in the affinity of tc for tetr <dig>  the average maximum number of teta molecules that are produced in the presence of tc increases as the wild type affinity of tc for tetr <dig> increases . as expected, this has an effect on the maximum number of intracellular tc molecules. this effect is shown in figure 6b where the average maximum number of intracellular tc molecules decreases as the wild type affinity of tc for tetr <dig> increases. this can be ascribed to the fact that when the affinity of tc for tetr <dig> increases, the formation rate of the complex tetr2:tc <dig> increases, thereby accelerating gene induction. therefore, more teta molecules are generated. as a consequence, tc is excluded faster from the cell, making intracellular tc level lower. on the other hand, a decrease in the wild type affinity of tc for tetr <dig> leads to a decrease in the intracellular teta amount . this decrease in turn elicits a drastic increase on the intracellular tc amounts .

it should be kept in mind that the lower the intracellular tc amount, the higher the probability for the cell to survive. this implies that an increase in the affinity of tc for tetr <dig>  could help the e. coli to survive. on the other hand, a decrease in the affinity of tc for tetr <dig> could lead to the faster death of e. coli.

another interesting observation is that a large decrease  in the affinity of tc for tetr <dig>  makes the tet operon less sensitive to external tc. in this case, higher tc amounts must be administered to induce gene expression. in particular, the number of administered tc molecules must be  <dig> or higher before expression of teta is turned on . this is also evident when the affinity is  <dig> times smaller than the wild type. then, more than  <dig> tc molecules must be administered for teta expression to take place. on the other hand, in the other three cases , gene expression is activated even with the administration of only  <dig> tc molecules. this phenomenon is observed because the higher the affinity of tc for tetr <dig>  the easier and faster the binding of tc to tetr <dig>  and consequently the gene induction.

for small numbers of administered tc molecules , the difference between the  <dig> cases is not large concerning the maximum average intracellular tc amount . however, regarding teta , the difference between the  <dig> cases is large even for small numbers of administered tc molecules. the high teta amounts combined with low intracellular tc amounts could have harmful effects for the cell since high excess of teta in the cell could lead to cell membrane collapse. furthermore, when the affinity is larger than the nominal value , little difference in the intracellular tc amount is noticed. on the other hand, a substantial difference in the intracellular tc amount is observed in the cases where the affinity is smaller than the nominal value . this implies that the system is more sensitive to a decrease in the affinity of tc for tetr <dig> than to an increase. this probably stems from the fact that the affinity of tc for tetr <dig> is already high and not rate limiting, thus higher values do not cause dramatic changes. furthermore, this indicates that the wild type network affinity is optimal since it is as high as possible to reduce tc while not increasing teta significantly.

lastly, it is worth stressing that our changes in the affinity of tc for tetr and tetr <dig> do not affect the average number of tetr and tetr <dig> molecules when tc is administered . the intracellular amount of these two molecules remains practically the same even upon applying the aforementioned changes.

affinity of tetr <dig> for the operator sites
here, we explore the significance of the high binding strength   <cit>  of tetr <dig> to the operator sites, teto <dig> and teto <dig>  this feature enables the repressor to bind quickly and tightly to the operator sites in the absence of tc, making this operon a thoroughly tuned biological switch. the importance of this feature is investigated through a set of simulations in which the binding strength of the repressor for the operators is  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> times lower than the wild type value. this could be experimentally achieved by either introducing amino acid changes on the tetr protein or mutating the operator sites  <cit> . in our simulations, this is attained by decreasing all the corresponding kinetic parameters   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> times. we decrease the rate that tetr <dig> binds to the operators when it is either free  or bound on tc , causing a decrease to the binding strength. in contrast to the previous case, in which the affinity of tc for the repressor is investigated, we only consider a decrease and not an increase to the binding affinity. the binding affinity value is already very high and a possible increase would not be experimentally meaningful due to diffusion limitations. the results of the simulations are shown in figure  <dig> and they represent the average maximum teta and tc amounts in the cells.

according to the results, the fidelity of the tet operon appears to be susceptible to changes in the affinity of tetr <dig> for the operators. a decrease in the affinity of tetr <dig> for the operators results in an increase in the amount of generated teta . thus, lower affinities give rise to higher teta production. higher teta amount leads to faster tc removal from the cell thereby leading to lower intracellular tc amounts . the decreased amount of intracellular tc is beneficial for the cell. however, the decrease in the affinity of tetr <dig> for the operators results also in an increase in the teta, tetr and tetr <dig> amount at steady state. this causes the tet operon to loose its unique function. in other words, the trade off in having tc removed fast from the cell is the high intracellular teta, tetr and tetr <dig> amounts at steady state.

as remarked previously, tet operon is a unique biological switch  <cit> . this is attributed to the optimal design of high affinity levels which accommodates 1) small number of tetr <dig> molecules at steady state, which allows gene induction to occur with minimal tc amounts, and 2) tight repression of teta gene, which does not allow the production of teta in the absence of tc. therefore, at steady state, the intracellular tetr and tetr <dig> amount is small  and the teta amount is zero. however, here we observe that when the affinity of tetr <dig> for the operator sites decreases, the amount of teta, tetr and tetr <dig> increases. in particular, when the affinity is  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> times lower than the wild type value, the number of intracellular teta molecules at steady state is  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> respectively . the lower the affinity of tetr <dig> for the operator sites, the higher the teta amount at steady state. thus, the decrease in the affinity of tetr <dig> for the operators results in non-zero teta amounts at steady state. this in turn could cause cell death because teta, in the absence of tc, is toxic for the cell  <cit> .

additionally, when the affinity of tetr <dig> for the operators is  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> times lower than the nominal value, the average number of intracellular tetr and tetr <dig> molecules is  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> respectively . given that the tetr and tetr <dig> amount in each single cell experiences large fluctuations, the higher the mean value, the higher the fluctuations in the tetr and tetr <dig> amount. furthermore, the higher the intracellular tetr and tetr <dig> amount, the higher the required tc amount for inducing gene expression. this happens because the administered tc is occupied by the free tetr and tetr <dig> molecules and therefore cannot bind to the tetr <dig> bound on the operators to activate expression. therefore, the large intracellular tetr and tetr <dig> amounts require large tc amounts to induce gene expression thereby eliminating the functionality of the tet operon. thus, the aforestated changes in the amount of tetr, tetr <dig> and teta at steady state are detrimental to the e. coli. this confirms that tet operon is a very well tuned system and possible changes in its crucial parameters could be harmful for the e. coli.

it is noticeable that the differences in tc and teta amounts that are caused by changing the affinity of tc for tetr <dig> are larger than the differences that are caused by modifying the affinity of tetr <dig> for the operator sites. this indicates that the tet operon is more sensitive to changes in the affinity of tc for tetr <dig> than in the affinity of tetr <dig> for the operators.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a detailed mathematical model for the tet operon and performed stochastic simulations to examine the mechanisms that govern the dynamics of this interesting biological system. conducting stochastic simulations, we investigated the average behavior of  <dig>  cells, the variability across the cells, and finally the single cell behavior. the results of the simulations are in agreement with, and explain well numerous experimental observations such as tight repression, fast gene expression, induction with small tc amounts, and small intracellular tetr <dig> amounts.

our simulations demonstrate that there is a nearly linear relationship between the administered tc and the teta amount. furthermore, the results indicate large fluctuations in the amount of the repressor protein tetr <dig>  additionally, our findings highlight that the behavior of the tet operon is the same even when it lacks the promoter tetpr <dig>  this could imply that this promoter is redundant and not necessary in e. coli, although it may be functionally important in other bacteria. it could also indicate that although e. coli used to need this promoter, they do not need it anymore and it just exists in their genome.

sensitivity analysis illustrates that the affinity of tc for the repressor tetr <dig> and the affinity of tetr <dig> for the operator sites have a high impact on the behavior of the tet operon, suggesting optimum interaction strengths developed through natural selection. in particular, an increase in the affinity of tc for the repressor leads to an increase in the production of teta protein. increased teta amounts remove tc from the cell faster, thereby keeping the levels of the intracellular tc low. a decrease in the affinity of the tetr <dig> for the operators results in the production of more teta protein upon tc administration. additionally, it results in an increase in the number of tetr, tetr <dig> and teta molecules at steady state. this causes a decrease in the number of intracellular tc molecules, increasing the probability for the cell to survive. however, the existence of intracellular teta at steady state may lead to cell death.

the need for a mechanistic understanding of bacterial resistance to tc was identified many years ago  <cit> . computer simulations of the tet operon provide a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between the tet operon molecular elements. they also provide valuable information that may contribute to the design of prototype synthetic gene regulatory networks.
