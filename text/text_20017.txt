BACKGROUND
ectotherms exhibit a suite of behavioural and physiological strategies to cope with spatiotemporal variation in ambient temperature  <cit> . for instance, behavioural adjustments  can buffer the impact of sub-optimal temperatures, and are the main means of thermoregulation in small insects  <cit> . although such adjustments can enable ectotherms to maintain relatively constant body temperatures  at different seasons and/or latitudes  <cit> , the observation of cyclical seasonal changes in genetic markers putatively related to thermal adaptation  <cit>  and the clinal variation in thermal stress tolerance in some drosophila species  <cit>  suggest that behavioural thermoregulation may be insufficient to fully compensate shifts in environmental temperature  <cit> .

if behavioural thermoregulation is not fully compensatory and climate variation influences the actual tb and physiological performance of organisms distributed over broad latitudinal ranges , then temperature is more than just a key environmental factor that affects development, growth, and survival of individuals  <cit> : it is likely the main selective agent that drives - directly or indirectly - the evolution of clinal patterns in genetic, phenotypic, and life history traits. furthermore, the divergence of thermal optima in the different subpopulations according to the tb experienced by the organism is expected to bolster a covariance between behavioural shifts  and performance  <cit> . this is related to the idea of "coadaptation"  <cit> , where natural selection is supposed to favour the harmonious adjustment among the suite of evolving traits  <cit> . parallel clines on different continents or along independent temperature gradients can thus offer an invaluable opportunity to study thermal coadaptation since the role of temperature in driving those clines is quite compelling.

some widespread latitudinal clines in drosophila also provide an additional advantage for studies of thermal coadaptation: there is a relatively well-known historical record following the invasion of a new geographical region . perhaps the best example is that of drosophila subobscura, a native palaearctic species that invaded the americas about  <dig> years ago, and spread rapidly on both south and north america. clinal patterns for phenotypic traits and genetic polymorphisms emerged very rapidly during these two independent colonization events  <cit> . for instance, north american populations soon evolved decreased desiccation resistance with increasing latitude as expected, which matches the pattern found in old world populations and suggests that strong selection for thermal-related traits along latitudinal gradients is taking place. on the other hand, in south america this trait shows the opposite pattern: higher desiccation tolerance is observed in colder areas  <cit> . contrasting outcomes were also observed for other clinally varying traits - wing cell size and cell number  <cit> , and wing shape  <cit>  - where the role of temperature remains elusive, which apparently suggests that selective pressures vary in the different clines. an alternative explanation, however, is that evolution can sometimes be constrained by antagonistic genetic correlations  arising from linkage disequilibrium between alleles at different loci, and patterns of linkage disequilibrium can vary among populations or seasons  <cit> . in this context, we now know that contrasting wing shape clines in d. subobscura came out as a correlated response of the world-wide parallel inversion clines  <cit>  because inversion-shape relationships in native and colonizing populations are opposite , probably as a result of the bottleneck effect that occurred during the colonization of america  <cit> . besides, different patterns of linkage disequilibrium could result from variability in migration rates between genetically differentiated populations in the various latitudinal clines  <cit> . in summary, conflicting outcomes between old and rapidly evolving new clines should probably not be viewed as a nuisance, but as reminder that an appropriate knowledge of the underlying genetic architecture is required to further understand why  these inconsistencies arise. more specifically, if behaviour "drives" the subsequent parallel evolution in morphology and physiology as predicted , it is essential to analyze the genetic basis of thermal preference and temperature-related traits to see whether or not thermal coadaptation can happen along a cline.

we have recently undertaken a within-population large-scale study to analyze the association between chromosomal inversion polymorphisms that show parallel latitudinal clines in native and colonizing populations of d. subobscura, with the thermal preferences  and knock out temperatures  of their carriers  <cit> . the main results can be summarized as follows:  flies carrying "cold-adapted" or "cold-climate" chromosome arrangements  prefer a lower tp and had a lower tko, in accordance with the natural patterns;  different chromosomes were responsible for the bulk of the genetic variation in tp  and tko ; and  tp and tko were phenotypically uncorrelated, which agrees with the observation that different independently segregating chromosomes were mainly responsible for the corresponding associations. taken at a face value, behavioural thermoregulation and performance were indeed "coadapted" in the sense that cold-climate  chromosome arrangements collectively favour a coherent response to colder  environments, but this was not due to a genetic covariance of behaviour and physiology. there were, however, two potential limitations in the study. first, each individual fly was scored for only one chromosome of its diploid set and, hence, dominance effects  where hidden in the analysis. second, both intra- and interchromosomal contributions were mixed because the assayed flies had the genetic background from the sampled wild population. although it might be argued that this protocol is somehow closer to what happens in nature, these uncontrolled factors might have precluded a better characterization of the underlying genetic effects. accordingly, although the amount of genetic variation on tp and tko explained by the combined effect of all chromosomes carrying at least one cold-climate gene arrangement was statistically significant, it only accounted for 1% of the total phenotypic variation  <cit> .

here we examine if tp and tko are genetically correlated and might evolve in a coherent fashion in response to selection; i.e., whether behaviour and physiology are coadapted at the genetic level. we take advantage of the fact that the polymorphic inversions on chromosome o appear to be associated with behavioural thermoregulation in d. subobscura  <cit> , and that this is the only chromosome that can be used to measure the expression of associated traits in replicated inbred and outbred genotypes. namely, chromosome o is the only one for which a balancer stock  is available . this is the longest chromosome in d. subobscura , and is homologous to arm 3r in d. melanogaster  <cit> . some chromosome arrangements  show conspicuous northwest-southwest latitudinal clines in palaearctic populations . chromosome o harbours several genes involved in the heat shock response  <cit> ; in particular, gene hsp <dig>   <cit>  and relatively close to the proximal breakpoint of inversion o <dig>  <cit> ), and gene hsp <dig>   <cit>  and included inside the warm-climate chromosomal arrangement o3+ <dig>  and close to the distal breakpoint of inversion o <dig>  <cit> ) . hsp <dig> appears to be the primary protein involved in thermotolerance in d. melanogaster  <cit>  - though apparently not in other drosophila species  <cit>  -, and hsp <dig> allele frequencies show latitudinal clines and change in response to thermal evolution in the laboratory  <cit> . in addition, correlated responses to selection for knock down resistance at 39°c have also been found for hsp <dig> in d. melanogaster  <cit> .

previous work also showed that d. subobscura flies carrying o chromosomes derived from replicated thermal lines  <cit>  that had evolved in the laboratory at warm temperatures  had a higher total net fitness than its cold-adapted  counterparts; that is, a significant shift in thermal optima was observed  <cit> . all in all, it seems that there is indeed room for the coevolution of behaviour and physiological tolerance in d. subobscura. however, we show here that thermal preference and heat tolerance appear to be genetically independent. therefore, any latitudinal correlation between both traits would likely reflect a pattern of correlated selection across populations rather than within-population genetic correlations.

experimental settings
in south-western european populations, the most frequent chromosome arrangements for chromosome o are ost, o3+ <dig>  o3+4+ <dig>  and o3+4+ <dig>  <cit> . the first two arrangements show a clear contrasting clinal pattern in original palaearctic populations, with ost increasing and o3+ <dig> decreasing in frequency with increasing latitude  <cit>  . arrangement o3+4+ <dig> is also interesting because in historical times it was mainly restricted to the mediterranean region, being the most abundant chromosomal arrangement in northern africa  <cit> . however, in the last decades its distribution has changed dramatically and recent surveys revealed frequencies as high as  <dig> % in groningen, netherlands, where it was previously absent  <cit> . six independent isochromosomal lines for each of these three arrangements  were used in the present experiments. extensive genetic differentiation of up to  <dig> mb  has been detected among these arrangements  <cit> . in other words, there are compelling reasons to think that the chromosome arrangements used in this work are genetically differentiated for hsp <dig>  and probably also for hsp <dig> since inversion effects can extend as far as  <dig> kilobases outside from breakpoints  <cit> .

following santos et al.  <cit>  the experimental flies were obtained from  <dig> crosses, which will be referred to as inbred , or as outbred including both structural homokaryotypes  and heterokaryotypes . two developmental temperatures were used in the experiment to study potentially important effects of phenotypic plasticity: 18°c and 22°c. the reason for this was the huge difference  between our previous estimate of tp  in d. subobscura flies raised at 18°c, and that obtained by huey and pascual  where flies were raised at 22°c. even though the flies assayed came from different sources - south-western europe in rego et al.  <cit> , and north america in huey and pascual  <cit>  -, which could account for the observed difference because thermal responses can vary between populations  <cit> , it remains to be seen whether developmental plasticity can affect estimates of thermal preference and heat tolerance.

RESULTS
association between thermal preference and knock out temperature
the phenotypic correlation between tp and tko was assessed from their partial correlation coefficient, holding constant the variables developmental temperature, sex, plate hour, and water bath . in no case were the partial correlations statistically significant: inbred crosses rtp⋅tko= <dig> , t =  <dig> , df =  <dig>  p =  <dig> ; outbred crosses rtp⋅tko=− <dig> , t =  <dig> , df =  <dig>  p =  <dig> . furthermore, as expected from the low values of the phenotypic correlation, the genetic  correlation for the outbred flies was also close to zero . the conclusion is that both traits are nearly orthogonal to each other  and, hence, they will be analyzed separately in what follows.

consanguinity and developmental effects
a) thermal preference
inbreeding and developmental temperature effects on tp were simultaneously analyzed by contrasting isogenic vs. outbred homokaryotypic flies reared at both experimental temperatures . the factorial analysis of covariance  only detected statistically significant differences for karyotypes, karyotype × inbreeding interaction, and karyotype × developmental temperature interaction effects . average  tp was not different between rearing temperatures  or sexes , although in this last case the effect was marginally non-significant . permutation tests  corroborated that the three assayed karyotypes differ in tp .

flies raised from inbred  and outbred crosses of drosophila subobscura reared at 18°c and 22°c. karyotypes being compared are ost/ost, o3+4/o3+ <dig>  and o3+4+8/o3+4+ <dig>  

scheffé post hoc tests using the mean square of the nested "cross" effect as the error term showed that the thermal preference of ost/ost flies was significantly lower when compared to those of o3+4/o3+ <dig> and o3+4+8/o3+4+ <dig> homokaryotypes, which did not differ between them. the difference is consistent for both isogenic and outbred flies . from the present data we can conclude that the preferred temperature ranges or "set point"  ranges  are bounded by  <dig> °c -  <dig> °c for ost/ost karyotypes, and  <dig> °c -  <dig> °c for the other two karyotypes.

the karyotype × inbreeding interaction arises from the somewhat different behaviour between ost/ost and o3+4/o3+ <dig> karyotypes on one side, and o3+4+8/o3+4+ <dig> on the other: for the first two karyotypes tp was slightly higher in inbred crosses when compared to their outbred counterparts, whereas the opposite was true for the o3+4+8/o3+4+ <dig> karyotype. average tp was, however, almost identical for inbred  and outbred  flies. on the other hand, ost/ost flies raised at 22°c had a higher tp than those raised at 18°c, but no clear trend was observed for o3+4/o3+ <dig> and o3+4+8/o3+4+ <dig> karyotypes.

b) knock out temperature
knock out temperatures are plotted in figure  <dig>  the ancova  detected statistically significant differences for the effects of rearing temperature and sex. flies reared at 18°c had a higher tko than flies reared at 22°c , and females had a higher tko than males . even though tko was slightly lower for the isogenic lines when compared to their outbred counterparts , inbreeding effects were clearly non-significant .

gene arrangement effects in the outbred lines
a) thermal preference
the genetic and environmental  contributions of chromosome o to tp  was assessed from the outbred crosses including all possible karyotypes. outbred crosses are obviously more relevant to the real situation because inbred genotypes are homozygous for deleterious alleles, and also for alleles that might display heterozygote advantage in the original outbred population. the only statistically significant effects detected by the ancova model  were those arising from genetic differences among karyotypes  and sexes, with females having a higher tp  than males . as above, average tp was slightly lower for flies reared at 18°c  than at 22°c , but the difference was marginally non-significant .

flies raised from outbred crosses of drosophila subobscura reared at 18°c and 22°c. karyotypes being compared are ost/ost, o3+4/o3+ <dig>  o3+4+8/o3+4+ <dig>  ost/o3+ <dig>  ost/o3+4+ <dig> and o3+4/o3+4+ <dig>  o3+4* stands for o3+ <dig> + o3+4+ <dig>  

the linear contrast between the two ost/o3+4* heterokaryotypes  reveals that ost/o3+ <dig> and ost/o3+4+ <dig> flies displayed a similar average tp . however, some differences were detected among the three o3+4*/o3+4* karyotypes, which can be attributed to some under-dominance because average tp for o3+4/o3+4+ <dig> flies  was lower than that for the corresponding homokaryotypes . in any case, the main difference was between ost and o3+4∗ carriers, with mainly additive genetic effects . as already indicated, ost/ost flies clearly preferred lower temperatures than o3+4/o3+ <dig> or o3+4+8/o3+4+ <dig> flies.

b) knock out temperature
the ancova for tko  did not detect any difference among karyotypes, in accordance with the previous findings for the inbred crosses. similarly, the main differences arose between developmental temperature  and sex .

flies raised from outbred crosses of drosophila subobscura reared at 18°c and 22°c. karyotypes being compared are ost/ost, o3+4/o3+ <dig>  o3+4+8/o3+4+ <dig>  ost/o3+4+ <dig>  and o3+4/o3+4+ <dig>  o3+4* stands for o3+ <dig> + o3+4+ <dig>  

the genetic correlation between tp and tko after pooling o3+ <dig> and o3+4+8was rp = - <dig>  . again, the conclusion is that these two traits are uncorrelated. figure  <dig> plots the genotypic values in the additive-dominance scales for tp and tko, together with their statistical significance obtained from the appropriate contrasts .

c) average effects on thermal preference
our experiment only provides an estimation of the gene  action on tp and does not allow inferences to the base population. it is possible, however, to obtain estimates of the average effects, or "statistically additive effects", by taking into account the gene action and allelic  frequencies in the natural populations  <cit> . assuming that the chromosome arrangement effects are roughly the same along the cline , table  <dig> gives the average effects  estimated from the frequencies of the different arrangements in european populations spanning about 17° latitude  <cit> . the interpretation is that flies inheriting a ost chromosome will choose a temperature ranging from around  <dig> °c -  <dig> °c below the average temperature chosen by the population .

o3+4* pools gene arragements o3+ <dig> and o3+4+ <dig> used in the present work. together with ost, their combined frequency is ≥  <dig>  in central european populations and drops to approximately  <dig>  in south-western europe, where arrangement o3+4+ <dig> is also frequent. however, from our previous data  <cit>  no difference in tp is detected between o3+4+ <dig> and o3+4*, which justifies their pooling and allows estimating average effects assuming two gene arrangements: ost and the rest. gene arrangement frequencies where taken from the "new collections" in solé et al.  <cit>  and balanyà et al.  <cit> .

combined with our previous results with chromosome a , where gene arrangement ast exhibits a similar latitudinal pattern than ost and flies carrying ast also display a laboratory thermal preference towards colder temperature, the conclusion is that flies inheriting simultaneously ast and ost will choose temperatures ranging from approximately  <dig> °c -  <dig> °c below the average .

discussion
the present results with isogenic lines and their crosses corroborate and extend our previous work with wild flies from south-western europe  <cit> . they confirm that arrangements on chromosome o have a biometrical effect on thermal preference in a laboratory temperature gradient, with cold-climate ost carriers displaying a lower tp than their warm-climate o3+ <dig> and o3+4+ <dig> counterparts. in addition, tp and tko were again found to be uncorrelated, and we can now discard a potential genetic covariance between both traits arising from linkage disequilibrium between genes affecting thermal preference and candidate genes for heat shock resistance  located inside of, or close to, the chromosome regions covered by the inversions analyzed here . in other words, we conclude that variation on o chromosome arrangements does not have any effect on knock out temperature . note, however, that this does not imply that genes on chromosome o have no effect on tko ; it simply indicates that any allelic variation of putative genes influencing this trait is not in linkage disequilibrium with inversions on this chromosome.

the new findings were:  a lack of inbreeding depression for both tp and tko;  a lack of phenotypic plasticity for tp according to the temperature at which the flies were raised ; and  a substantial effect of developmental temperature on tko. the absence of inbreeding depression for tp agrees with the genetic analysis from outbred flies, where a dominance effect after pooling chromosome arrangements o3+ <dig> and o3+4+ <dig> into a single class  was absent . on the other hand, the lack of inbreeding depression for tko is expected and does not mean anything here, simply because no "gene" effects linked to chromosomal arrangements on chromosome o were detected. at first sight this might be surprising because a well-characterized cellular defence mechanism once environmental temperature approaches the upper thermal limits is the heat shock response, and in d. melanogaster the major inducible heat shock protein hsp <dig> appears to be the primary protein involved in thermotolerance  <cit> . recent work, however, questions the pervasive role of hsp <dig> in the mediation of the heat stress response and suggests that it may be life-stage specific, being important in larvae but not in adults  <cit> . our results are apparently consistent with the lack of association between hsp <dig> and adult heat resistance , although also raise a caveat to the conclusion that there is no covariance between tp and tko. thus, it could be the case that hsp <dig> variation across karyotypes is associated with juvenile tolerance to heat stress, an important trait in drosophila particularly in summer when larval feeding patches can become lethally hot  <cit> . this possibility warrants further analysis.

an important concern here is that hsp <dig> production might not be inducible in the dynamic experimental protocol we used to estimate upper thermal tolerance, where temperature increased  <dig> °c min- <dig>  one apparently compelling reason for this is that the estimated maximum thermal limits that d. melanogaster can tolerate decrease from approximately  <dig> °c with heating rate  <dig> °c min- <dig> to  <dig> °c with heating rate  <dig> °c min- <dig>  <cit> , a puzzling result because slower heating rates should allow individuals to acclimatize to new temperatures and also because slow heating rates pre-exposes individuals to non-lethal high temperatures , which increases heat shock resistance  <cit> . we have recently discussed why these conflicting outcomes arise, and suggest that the contribution of other stressors  can potentially overshadow thermal acclimation effects in dynamic assays with varying heating rates  <cit> . in other words, we challenge the idea that induced thermotolerance does not occur in dynamic assays with slow heating rates. at this stage this is just speculative because hsp <dig> production was not measured in our flies, but the problem is important because drosophila adults are likely to experience slow heating rates in nature of  <dig>  -  <dig> °c min- <dig>  <cit>  and further empirical studies are required to explain the apparently inconsistent findings.

the pooled average tp here was   <dig> °c ±  <dig> °c  and about the same at both rearing temperatures. the difference with our previous estimate for wild-flies from adraga  does not seem to be overreached, and could be partially explained by the fact that the present flies were genetically homogeneous for all chromosomes from the ch-cu marker strain but chromosome o . this strain has a long history of maintenance at 18°c in the laboratory. in any case, our estimates remain substantially lower than that from huey and pascual , and the difference cannot be accounted by flies' rearing temperature. no reasonable explanation for the discrepancy can be offered at this moment, but the additional result that developmental temperature substantially affected tko makes us confidently conclude that our estimates are indeed closer to the actual tp of the species. flies reared at 22°c showed lower heat resistance than their counterparts reared at 18°c , which could be a consequence of their smaller size due to the inverse relationship between body size and developmental temperature  <cit> . however, resistance to heat does not seem to be associated with body size  <cit>  - we have also analyzed the association between tko and wing size from our previous experiment where both traits were recorded  <cit>  and found no relationship whatsoever . most likely, 22°c was a suboptimal and potentially stressful temperature for our flies, making them to be weaker and less resistant to the heat shock. note, however, that this conclusion might not be extrapolated to wild flies that harbour higher levels of genetic variability than our chromosomal lines.

to interpret the interplay between thermal preference and heat stress resistance, an understanding of the environmental temperatures experienced by d. subobscura along climatic gradients is required. as far as we are aware, the only data available on tb for active flies along a latitudinal gradient  come from recent work by huey and pascual  <cit>  in western north america. they found that mean tb varies by as much as 21°c , and that the temporal activity of flies during the day did not match predictions from optimal temperature regulation or desiccation avoidance. temperatures of maximum activity in summer  - when wild flies are smaller probably due to their higher developmental temperatures and/or crowding conditions  <cit> ; and crowding is known to affect adult thermal stress resistance in drosophila  <cit>  - are dangerously close to the tko obtained here for the outbred flies raised at 22°c. this suggests that active d. subobscura flies can experience extreme conditions in the wild, and one would expect flies' activity to be correlated with heat resistance under these conditions if behaviour and physiology were coadapted. some evidence indicates that diurnal activity patterns in summer can vary according to inversion polymorphism, and chromosome arrangements on the o chromosome seem to behave as expected from our data: ost is more frequent towards the evening while chromosomes carrying gene arrangement o3+ <dig> are most frequently sampled at midday  <cit> . this behavioural thermoregulation, however, would not confer less susceptibility to high temperatures because the genetic basis of both traits does not seem to allow for the building up of "coadaptation". it is well known from basic population genetics theory that genetic covariance between traits can arise when alleles at different loci are associated , and this critically depends on relatively low recombination rates  <cit> . the lack of association between tp and tko in d. subobscura is fully consistent with their genetic basis as independently segregating chromosomes are involved  <cit> . yet, a correlation between these traits can be expected at the interpopulational level due to patterns of correlated selection  across a latitudinal gradient because of the congruent latitudinal clinal variation for chromosome arrangements on the e , and on the a and o chromosomes .

we now speculate that the mismatch between tp and tko could apparently generate an interesting dynamics in the population frequencies of different chromosome arrangements on chromosome o. suppose the daily activity of flies in the warmest months of the year follows the previously described pattern; that is, flies carrying gene arrangement o3+ <dig> are more active at midday and, therefore, have a higher risk of a heat shock than ost and are selected against. on the other hand, assuming tp corresponds closely with temperatures that maximize fitness o3+ <dig> flies likely enjoy a fitness advantage in summer. the net effect would be a compromise between "behaviour unresponsiveness" and general performance, which means that chromosome arrangements on chromosome o may or may not cycle seasonally according to average environmental temperature . interestingly, both patterns have been detected: consistent seasonal cycling at a north-western population in spain  <cit>  and apparently no seasonal variation at a north-eastern population also in spain  <cit> . the point here is that parallel seasonal changes should also be detected for chromosome a since it also affects tp  <cit> . in accordance with this prediction, no seasonal cycling was detected for chromosome a in the north-eastern population, but unfortunately no information is available for the other population because chromosome o was the only chromosome scored. it would be very interesting to see what happens for chromosome a in the cycling population.

CONCLUSIONS
for ectotherms facing spatiotemporal variation in environmental temperature theory predicts that a coevolution between thermal preference and physiological performance can occur  <cit> . in the widespread species d. subobscura behavioural thermoregulation and heat tolerance are "coadapted" in the sense that flies carrying cold-climate  chromosome arrangements tend to choose colder  temperatures and have lower  heat stress tolerance  <cit> . we have analyzed the genetic basis of these thermal traits using isochromosomal lines for the o chromosome. this chromosome was known to affect thermal preference  <cit> , and also harbours several genes involved in the heat shock response   <cit> . these genes are located inside of, or close to, the chromosome regions covered by inversions that show conspicuous northwest-southwest latitudinal clines in palaearctic populations, as well as seasonal fluctuations that are in agreement with the latitudinal patterns  <cit> . our results corroborate that arrangements on chromosome o affect adult thermal preference: flies inheriting the cold-climate ost chromosome are predicted to choose a temperature around  <dig> °c -  <dig> °c below the average temperature chosen by the population and, conversely, flies inheriting the warm-climate o3+ <dig> and o3+4+ <dig> chromosomes are expected to choose a temperature ranging from around  <dig> °c -  <dig> °c above the average. however, these chromosome arrangements did not have any differential effect on adult heat tolerance. we conclude that thermal preference and heat tolerance in d. subobscura appear to be genetically independent and, therefore, any latitudinal correlation between both traits would likely reflect a pattern of correlated selection across populations rather than within-population genetic correlations.
