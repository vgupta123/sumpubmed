BACKGROUND
nf-kb is an inducible transcription factor complex involved in the regulation of genes necessary for cell survival, differentiation, immunity and inflammation  <cit> . rela, c-rel and relb are transcriptional activating subunits that contain a n-terminal rel homology domain  and a c-terminal transcription activation domain  whereas nf-kb <dig>  and nf-kb <dig>  are dna-binding proteins that contain c-terminal autoinhibitory ankyrin repeat domains  <cit> . in most cells, nf-kb is high molecular weight heterodimeric complexes containing a dna-binding- and a transcription activator subunit retained in the cytoplasm by inhibitor of kappa b  proteins. receptor activation by numerous ligands induces phosphorylation of ikbα, targeting it for degradation and allowing nuclear translocation of rela•nf-kb <dig> dimers, the most abundant and most potent transcription factor pair required for activation of inflammatory and anti-apoptotic gene expression programs  <cit> .

beg and colleagues were the first to describe the lethality of whole-body rela deficiency in mice  <cit> . mating of rela heterozygous mice failed to generate any rela-deficient  animals and an analysis of embryos indicated that rela-/- embryos undergo massive liver degeneration with hepatocyte apoptosis and consequently die in utero. these findings were independently corroborated using a different gene-targeting vector  <cit> . this study demonstrated that when rela-/- embryonic livers are transplanted into scid mice, t and b cells populate spleen and lymph nodes to similar extent as wild-type  cells, suggesting that the lethal effect of rela-/-in utero is due to impairment of hepatocyte development and not due to deranged hematopoiesis. in a subsequent finding, the lethal phenotype of rela-/- was rescued by absence of tnfα  <cit> . rela activation downstream of the tnf-receptor is necessary for the production of anti-apoptotic molecules, including traf- <dig>  traf- <dig>  c-iap <dig> and c-iap <dig> that protect cells from local, endogenously produced tnfα-induced apoptosis  <cit> .

to overcome embryonic lethality produced by whole-body rela deletion and to investigate the role of rela in disease-specific states, investigators have generated transgenic mice inserting loxp sites in the rela gene . dna recombination mediated by cre recombinase in rela-floxed animals leads to truncation or deletion of the rela protein. algul and colleagues created a rela-floxed mouse containing loxp sites in rela introns  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . induction of cre led to deletion of exons 7– <dig>  encoding the rhd, producing a truncated rela that failed to translocate to the nucleus. this strategy results in expression of a truncated rela c-terminal tad that potentially confounds the study. recently, another group created rela-floxed mice with loxp sites flanking the promoter region and exon  <dig> that resulted in the deletion of rela in b-cells when rela-floxed animals were crossed with cd19-cre trasngenics  <cit> . the strategy to excise only exon  <dig> of the rela gene has the potential to allow the expression of alternatively spliced variants. in the case of rela, there is putative internal ribosome entry site  in exons 4– <dig> which allows for 5′cap-indepedant translation  <cit> . additionally, there is evidence of alternatively spliced variants of rela in different cell types. for example, p65Δ variant lacks aa 222– <dig> and is abundantly expressed in pre-b and erythroid colony forming cells  <cit> . during screening of human adult osteoblastic cdna library a rela variant, p65Δ <dig>  has been found that lacks amino acids  13– <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the n-terminus aa 13– <dig> are part of the rhd, corresponding to exon  <dig> and  <dig>  and may be needed for binding to dna. although there has not been any exhaustive investigation into alternative rela splicing variants, the presence of ires in exons 4– <dig> and existence of rela nh2-terminal splice variants suggests that some rela transcripts may be produced in specialized cells under pathophysiological conditions that lack exon  <dig> but still can undergo translation. these splice variants would not be targeted in the flox mouse created by heise and colleagues. furthermore, cells that undergo recombination in the transgenic by hesie et al. begin expressing egfp. this strategy makes it easier to track recombined cells but the egfp signal could be confounding in leukocytes, such as monocytes/macrophages, that have significant intracellular granules and are autofluorescent in the same emission range as gfp  <cit> . we decided to create a rela-floxed mouse for investigating nf-kb signaling in vivo because, at the time, no such experimental tool was commercially available. our group has developed a rela-floxed transgenic mouse that allows for complete deletion of rela and which will be made available for use by the scientific community.

the mouse rela gene, comprised of  <dig> exons, is located within a  <dig> -kb region on chromosome  <dig>  our strategy was to introduce two loxp sites into intron  <dig> and intron  <dig> of the rela gene via gene targeting . in the presence of cre recombinase, a  <dig> -kb sequence containing exons 5– <dig> would be excised from relacko/cko generating the rela-/-. the deletion of exons 5– <dig>  which encode the c-terminus of its rhd , results in a downstream frame-shift that will further lead to degradation of rela transcripts via nonsense-mediated mrna decay.fig.  <dig> strategy for targeted mutation of the rela gene. a the open boxes represent exons 1– <dig>  and 9–11; the solid boxes represent exons 5– <dig>  the solid lines represent intronic sequences; the dashed line represents plasmid vector dna. the triangles represent loxp sequences and the ovals represent frt sequences. the gene-targeting vector possesses a total of  <dig> -kb homologous sequence. the pgkneobpa cassette was inserted into an ecorv site located ~ <dig> -kb upstream of exon  <dig>  the second  loxp was inserted into an aflii site located ~240-bp downstream of exon  <dig>  the vector has a  <dig> -kb 5′-homology arm, and a 3′-homology arm divided into  <dig> -kb and  <dig> -kb segments. homologous recombination between wt rela and the targeting vector may result in a rela mutant allele that carries both pgkneobpa cassette and the stand-alone loxp , or one that carries only pgkneobpa cassette . the 5′-flanking probe hybridized to ecorv-digested genomic dna detects  <dig> -kb wt bands, and  <dig> -kb targeted allele bands; the 3′-flanking probe hybridized to asp718-digested genomic dna detects  <dig> -kb wt bands,  <dig> -kb targeted  allele bands, and  <dig> -kb targeted  allele bands. b southern blot analysis of dna isolated from es cell clones. three clones, 1– <dig>  1– <dig>  and 2– <dig>  were found correctly targeted in the initial screening, and further expanded; dna was isolated and subjected to southern blot analysis. dna isolated from a random integration clone was used as a non-recombinant control . a restriction enzyme and a probe used in the analysis were indicated below each panel



RESULTS
the gene-targeting vector containing an frt-flanked neomycin positive-selection cassette, and a thymidine kinase negative-selection cassette  was electroporated into 129b6f <dig> hybrid mouse embryonic stem  cells, g <dig>  <cit> . one hundred-forty es cell colonies survived 9-days of double-drug selection. colonies were selected and propagated and dna isolated from the cells was screened for homologous recombinants by southern blotting. we found that twelve clones underwent homologous recombination at the rela locus, and of those, three clones incorporated a “stand-alone” loxp sequence in intron  <dig> . after further expansion and repeated southern blot analysis , all three clones were injected into c57bl/6j blastocysts. we then bred the resulting male chimeras with flper mice on a c57bl/6j background  to obtain offspring double-heterozygous for relacko allele and flp <dig> knock-in allele. the flper mice express flp <dig> recombinase in a wide range of cell types including germ cells  <cit> , and were used for flp-mediated removal of the neomycin cassette from the mutant rela allele . germ-line transmission of rela mutation was achieved with two clones, 1– <dig> and 1– <dig>  we then backcrossed double-heterozygous mice to c57bl/6j mice to segregate the flp <dig> transgene and to establish relacko lines. mice homozygous for relacko allele  were normal, fertile and expressed rela at normal levels.fig.  <dig> confirmation of pgkneobpa cassette removal. the internal probes hybridized to asp718-digested genomic dna detect  <dig> -kb wt bands,  <dig> -kb targeted  allele bands, and  <dig> -kb cko allele bands. tail dna was isolated from pups generated by mosaic females 26sor

to generate whole-body rela deficient mice containing the knockout alleles , we first crossed a relacko/+ mouse  and a zp3-cre transgenic mouse on a c57bl/ <dig> background , and obtained a relacko/+; tg93knw/ <dig> female mouse. in zp3-cre transgenic mice, cre expression is controlled by regulatory sequences from the mouse zona pellucida  <dig>  gene, which is normally expressed exclusively in the growing oocytes, and cre-mediated loxp recombination occurs in  <dig> % of oocytes  <cit> . therefore, backcrossing the relacko/+; tg93knw/ <dig> female mouse to a wild-type c57bl/6j male results in offspring: rela+/-; tg93knw/ <dig>  rela+/+; tg93knw/ <dig>  rela+/- and rela+/+. the offspring were genotyped by southern blot , and a rela+/- mouse was backcrossed to c57bl/6j mice for the propagation of the ko line. rela+/- male and female mating produced only rela+/- and rela+/+ embryos. analysis of embryos at embryonic day  <dig>  demonstrated that almost a quarter of them had intraabdominal hemorrhages with no clear macroscopic discernment of a liver . genotyping verified that these embryos were rela-/-. immunohistochemical analysis indicated very high immunoreactivity for cleaved-caspase  <dig> in the liver, signifying aberrant apoptosis . to further verify caspase- <dig> activation and apoptosis, we probed for cleaved poly adp-ribose polymerase - <dig>  a protein that is a target of activated caspase- <dig> in its latent form. rela-/- embryonic liver had robust immunostaining of cleaved parp- <dig> which was absent in rela+/+ livers. isolated mouse embryonic fibroblasts  were used to verify dna recombination and rela mrna and protein depletion in rela+/- and rela-/- cells . we failed to observe any shift in the rela band  using the santa-cruz antibody sc- <dig> that targets the tad, suggesting that a truncated rela is not produced in the genetically recombined cells. furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis was performed using three different antibodies targeting the n- and c-terminus domains of the rela protein . all three antibodies demonstrated robust rela immunostaining in the liver, brain and vertebrae of rela+/+ embryos. two antibodies targeting the c-terminus failed to show any staining in the rela-/- embryos whereas slight staining was observed in the liver with sc- <dig> antibody that recognizes the rhd at the n-terminus. the minor staining could be due to antibody cross-reactivity with other rhd-containing proteins such as relb or c-rel. to verify that the antibodies specifically recognized rela, whole cell lysates from a <dig> cell line were immunoprecipitated with the three rela antibodies and subjected to selected reaction monitoring- mass spectrometry analysis . relative to igg immunoprecipitates, there was 100-fold increase in rela when immunoprecipitation was performed with sc- <dig> and ab <dig> antibodies and approximately a 200-fold increase in rela when sc- <dig> antibody was used . we interpret this to mean that all three antibodies recognize rela and relacko/cko cells that have undergone dna recombination at the rela alleles do not produce rela. to determine whether cre-mediated recombination can also occur in vitro, we transduced cre via a lentivirus vector in relacko/cko mefs. in experiments infecting mefs with only a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig>  we observed a  <dig> % reduction in rela protein  with no shift in the rela band. these data confirm that rela can be depleted both in vitro using relacko/cko cells and in vivo using our rela cko/cko mice.fig.  <dig> confirmation of exon-5- <dig> removal. the 5′ probe hybridized to xbai-digested genomic dna detects  <dig> -kb wt bands,  <dig> -kb cko allele bands, and  <dig> -kb ko allele bands. tail dna shown in the figure was isolated from pups generated by a female heterozygous for rela
cko allele and hemizygous for zp3-cre transgene, and a wild-type c57bl/6j male

fig.  <dig> verification of rela deletion via immunohistochemistry using antibodies targeting rela n- and c-terminus. rela+/+ and rela-/- embryos, identified by pcr screen, were sectioned and immunostained for rela with three different antibodies targeting different regions of rela as depicted in the diagram. robust immunostaining of rela was observed with all three antibodies in the developing liver, brain and vertebrae of rela+/+ embryos. in contrast, there was a complete absence of signal in rela-/- embryos with antibodies targeting the c-terminus and a slight signal was observed in the liver with antibody targeting the n-terminus, possibly due to antibody cross-reactivity with other rhd containing proteins. this suggests that the recombined rela alleles fail to produce rela protein. n =  <dig> rela+/+ and n =  <dig> rel-/- embryo tissue sections were used in each experiment. representative images from three experiments are shown. all images were captured at 600× magnification. scale bar represents  <dig> microns



our ultimate goal is to study the tissue-specific role of rela in vivo. we have previously demonstrated that aortic fibroblasts produce significant amount of il- <dig> and mcp- <dig> that are nf-kb-dependent proteins, in vitro and the secretion of these cytokine/chemokine increases more than 2-fold in presence of monocytes  <cit> . we have defined this interaction to be occurring in vivo in the aortic wall and contributing to aortic inflammation and to the development of aortic dissections  <cit> . to test the hypothesis that fibroblast-rela contributes to aortic inflammation, we have developed fibroblast-specific rela-/- mice by crossing a tamoxifen inducible col1α2-promoter driven cre mouse  with relacko/cko mice. although the characterization of aortic fibroblast-rela depletion and the role of fibroblast-rela in aortic inflammation are currently being investigated by our lab, we have described here the experiments validating rela depletion that also occurs in skin fibroblast cells. after three generations of crosses, relacko/cko cre + and relacko/cko cre- littermates , which appeared normal and fertile, were treated with tamoxifen and their skin fibroblasts were isolated for characterization. cre + fibroblasts had decreased levels of rela in their cytoplasm  and in response to tnfα stimulation, failed to accumulate rela in the nucleus. we observed that only  <dig> % of the fibroblast had decreased rela immunostaining suggesting that tamoxifen administration affected only half of the skin fibroblasts. furthermore, rela transcripts  and protein  were depleted by approximately  <dig> % in cre + fibroblasts. collectively, these data demonstrated that col1α2-creer is efficiently activated in half of the dermal fibroblasts by tamoxifen administration and can promote the recombination of rela alleles in these cells leading to rela depletion. our future work will utilize this transgenic mouse to explore the role of fibroblast-rela in the development of vascular inflammation and fibrosis in vivo.fig.  <dig> tamoxifen mediated rela deletion in skin fibroblast in vivo. a to generate fibroblast-specific rela-/- mice, rela cko/cko mice were crossed with col1α2-creer mice. pcr on dna from tail biopsies was used to identify the double transgenic. mice harboring the cko allele were identified by the  <dig> bp product while those containing the wt allele were identified by the  <dig> bp product. b relacko/cko cre- and rela cko/cko cre + littermates were injected with  <dig> mg tamoxifen i.p. for  <dig> days. after  <dig> weeks, dermal fibroblasts were harvested from both genotypes and immunostained for rela after stimulation with vehicle or tnfα . cre + fibroblast had very little cytoplasmic rela under basal condition and also displayed less accumulation of rela in the nucleus after tnfα treatment. white arrows indicate cells that have decreased levels or absence of nuclear rela. c qrt-pcr on fibroblasts isolated from cre +  and cre-  mice after tamoxifen treatment suggests significant decrease in rela mrna levels in cre + fibroblasts. data are represented as mean +/- sem, *p <  <dig> . d in addition, the same cre + fibroblasts produce significantly less rela protein as determined by western blot. data are represented as mean +/- sem *p <  <dig> . a.u is arbitrary units



CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we report the generation of a transgenic mouse containing rela-flox alleles that recombine in the presence of active cre recombinase to generate rela-/- cells. this will be an important tool for studies investigating rela signaling in adult tissues since it allows one to bypass a major limitation, death in utero, that accompanies whole-body rela-/-. furthermore, this will be a valuable mouse model for exploring the role of rela in development, an under-explored area due to a lack of appropriate tools for investigation.
