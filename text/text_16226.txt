BACKGROUND
to effectively combat a wide range of pathogens, plants are able to induce a complex network of defense responses against invasions  <cit> . upon activation of the defense response, a large shift in resource allocation results in reduced growth rate and seed production  <cit> . therefore, defense responses are highly regulated through a complicated network of positive and negative regulatory mechanisms that allow plants to react appropriately to pathogens only when needed  <cit> .

the most well-studied regulator of systemic acquired pathogen resistance  is non expressor of pr <dig> , a transcription coactivator that regulates pr gene expression in the sa-dependent signaling pathway  <cit> . arabidopsis thaliana  npr <dig> mutants exhibit higher susceptibility to pathogen infection and impaired expression of pr genes  <cit> . additional positive regulators have been identified in sa-dependent systemic signaling, including enhanced disease susceptibility  <dig>   <cit> , sa induction deficient  <dig>   <cit>  and tga transcription factors  <cit> .

several negative regulators of the plant defense response have also been discovered in arabidopsis  <cit> . the nimin proteins show no obvious homology to known transcription factors other than a short ear motif, a motif found on repressors of ethylene and auxin induced transcription. nimin is thought to act as a modulator of pr- <dig> transcription levels, suppressing its expression during sa stimulated induction. the cpr <dig>  mutation causes constitutively high sa levels, increased pr <dig> expression in the absence of pathogen, and thus enhanced disease resistance  <cit> . sni <dig>  was identified as a repressor of genes targeted by npr <dig> induction, thus dampening the basal expression levels of downstream pr genes  <cit> . sni <dig> is a nuclear protein and it may function via chromatin remodeling through histone modification. moreover, the wrky transcription factors wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> are also involved in negative regulation of defense responses  <cit> . npr <dig> was recently shown to bind to sa and this interaction results in a conformational change which may contribute to the ability of npr <dig> to activate transcription  <cit> .

the functions of the arabidopsis npr <dig> paralogs, npr <dig>  npr <dig> and npr <dig>  are partially known. various lines of evidence demonstrate that they all act as components of the sa signal transduction pathway  <cit> . npr <dig> and npr <dig> have both been shown to bind to sa and to function in the regulation of the rate of proteosomal degradation of npr <dig> through a cullin 3/ubiquitine <dig> ligase mediated degradation pathway, thus linking sa concentration to the npr1-sa-dependant transcriptional defense response  <cit> . npr <dig> acts as a repressor of npr <dig> function by enhancing npr <dig> degradation, while npr <dig> acts at lower sa concentrations to enhance npr <dig> stability and increasing defense pathway activation. it is possible that all three proteins act as sa receptors working in different mechanisms to co-regulate the transcriptional defense response.

understanding the mechanisms regulating the defense response has profound implications for agriculture. such knowledge can be used to design breeding strategies, or to create transgenic plants with enhanced disease resistance against the plethora of plant pathogens. one such disease, witches’ broom disease of theobroma cacao , is caused by the fungal pathogen moniliophthora perniciosa, is a serious disease in latin america. indigenous to the amazon rainforest, it now occurs in most cocoa growing regions in south america and has became a serious threat to world cocoa production  <cit> . terminal and axillary buds, flower cushions and developing pods are highly susceptible to witches’ broom infection, resulting in severe yield loss  <cit> . the genome of this pathogen was recently sequenced  <cit>  and a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of pathogenicity is beginning to emerge  <cit> . in an effort to advance breeding of disease resistant varieties of cacao, we conducted research to further our understanding of the defense response in this tropical tree species.

several homologs of arabidopsis defensive proteins were previously identified in cacao after sa/meja treatment  <cit>  suggesting that a translational biology approach could be used to accelerate our knowledge of the cacao defense pathways. we have previously described the isolation and functional analysis of the cacao tcnpr <dig> gene  <cit>  and demonstrated it is a functional ortholog of arabidopsis npr <dig> by restoring the npr1- <dig> mutant phenotype in transgenic arabidopsis. in addition, a phylogenetic analysis of all four of the npr1-like gene family members in cacao was presented in the supplementary material of agrout et al.  <cit> , in which the full genome sequence of theobroma cacao was described.

in this manuscript, we present the isolation and functional analysis of the theobroma cacao gene tc06t <dig>  that is homologous to the arabidopsis npr <dig> gene at1g5g <dig>  the tcnpr <dig> gene was capable of partial restoration of the arabidopsis npr3- <dig> mutant disease resistant flower phenotype. moreover, micro-rna-mediated knock down of tcnpr <dig> expression in cacao leaves was strongly correlated to decreased susceptibility to infection by the cacao pathogen phytophthora capsici. based on our results, we conclude that tcnpr <dig> shares at least some of the central features of arabidopsis npr <dig>  and plays a role as a negative regulator of the defense response.

transgenic arabidopsis genetic complementation
a t-dna binary vector designed for overexpression of the tcnpr <dig> coding sequence  was created as follows. the tcnpr <dig> coding sequence was excised from pgem-tcnpr <dig> vector and cloned into kpni and noti sites of an intermediate cloning vector  between the very strong e12-Ω promoter  <cit>  and a 35s-camv terminator. a 3 kb restriction fragment containing this tcnpr <dig> gene cassette was excised from pe <dig> using ecori and pvuii and ligated into the ecori and smai sites of pcambia- <dig>  <cit> . ligations were performed for 1 hour at room temperature with  <dig> units of t <dig> dna ligase  resulting in p35s:tcnpr <dig>  the binary vector p35s:tcnpr <dig> containing a plant selectable hygromycin resistance gene was introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain agl <dig> by electroporation as previously described  <cit> . the floral dip method was used to transform arabidopsis npr3- <dig> mutants with p35s:tcnpr <dig>  <cit> . seeds were collected for  <dig> individual transgenic lines and the screening of positive transformants was conducted as in  <cit> . flower tissues from six-week old soil-grown col- <dig>  npr3- <dig> mutant and five individual transgenic lines were collected. rna was extracted from each genotype using rneasy plant mini kit . cdna was synthesized using m-mlv reverse transcriptase  as in  <cit> . rt-pcr was performed to identify the heterologous tcnpr <dig> expression. atubiquitin served as a cdna loading and normalization control. following primers and conditions were employed: tcnpr3-rt5′: tgcttgtcgacccgccatcaattt; tcnpr3-rt3′: aggttgtctcagcatgtgctatgtcc . ubiquitin-5′: accggcaagaccatcactct; ubiquitin-3′: aggcctcaactggttgctgt . the pcr products were resolved on 1% agarose gels.

plants were grown in a conviron growth chamber at 22°c, with 16 h light/8 h dark cycle 60% humidity and 200 μm/m2light intensity . pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc <dig> cultures were grown on pseudomonas agar with kanamycin  and rifampicin  at 28°c for two days. the pathogen infection and bacterial bioassay was conducted as previously described in  <cit> .

cacao microrna construct
a  <dig> nucleotide microrna of tcnpr <dig> was designed using the web-based designer at wmd <dig>  by choosing cacao est tcagi- <dig>  database. the mirna targets 373 bp upstream of the stop codon. the primer sequences were: .

iv mir*a gaattgaacgttttgatgcataatctacatatatattcct

a sequence containing an inverted repeat/hairpin loop structure was amplified from prs <dig> following the protocol on wmd <dig> , also as described in  <cit> , with the exception of using the following primers: f-spei: tactagtggtaccgggcccccc and r-hpai: gcgttaacctagtggatccccccatgg instead of oligo a and b, respectively which were used to amplify the completed fragment for cloning into the spei/hapi sites of transformation vector pgh <dig>   <cit>  driven by the 35s promoter.

transient gene knockout and detached leaf pathogen bioassay
vectors pgh <dig>   and pgs <dig>   were transformed in cacao leaves by agrobacterium  vacuum infiltration. agrobacterium was grown in  <dig> medium overnight to od600 =  <dig>  and induced as described in maximova et al.,  <cit>  for 5 hours. leaves, at developmental stage c  <cit> , were collected from greenhouse-grown plants, genotype sca <dig> and cut perpendicular to the midvein into  <dig> pieces per leaf. the  <dig> pieces from each leaf where infected with the control and the treatment vectors individually, for total of  <dig> leaf pieces per vector. prior to infection the cut surfaces of the mid-veins and secondary veins were sealed with melted paraffin . the sealed leaf pieces were submerged, abaxial side down, into 30 ml bacteria solution with  <dig> % silwet l- <dig>  dispensed in petri dishes . the petri dishes were placed in a 233 mm polycarbonate vacuum desiccator  and vacuum pressure  was applied for 2 min followed by a slow release. leaves were then blotted dry on a paper towels and placed abaxial side up into a petri dish  containing  <dig> layers of absorbent paper towels and one whatman # <dig> filter paper pre-moistened with 10 ml sterile water. the petri dishes were sealed with parafilm and incubated at 25°c for 2 days with light intensity of 145 m-2 sec.-1and 14 h daylight. after two days, two replicate leaf pieces per vector were quickly frozen on liquid nitrogen. total rna was extracted as previously described  <cit>  and cdna was obtained as described above. the relative expression of tcnpr <dig> to tcactin was measured by rt-q-pcr using takara sybr premix ex taqii kit  according to the user manual with 1: <dig> dilution of the cdna template. for each measurement, two biological replicates, each with two technical replicates were performed for both genes using the primers described above.

cacao pathogen phytophthora capsici was activated on petri dishes containing 10% v <dig> medium  for two days at 27°c, 12 h daylight. attached leaf pathogen bioassay was performed as previously described  <cit>  on the remaining six leaf pieces. the right half of each leaf portion was inoculated with  <dig> agar plugs containing actively growing phytophthora capsici mycelium and the left half was inoculated with sterile agar plugs as negative control. inoculated leaves were incubated at 27°c and 12 h day/light cycle for three days before the evaluation of disease symptoms. photographic images of the leaves were taken with a nikon d <dig> camera and average lesion sizes were determined using imagej software tools . average lesion sizes are calculated from  <dig> measurements  and significance was determined by single factor anova. to measure pathogen replication as a proxy of virulence, the ratio of phytophthora dna to cacao dna was measured by rt-q-pcr as follows. tissue samples including the lesions  were excised from the infected leaves and used for genomic dna extraction using a tissue lyzer homogenizer and the dneasy plant mini kit . the relative amount of phytophthora capsici genomic dna in leaf disks was measured by amplification of a pcactin gene  and tcactin <dig>   were used as pathogen and host targets respectively. dna rt-q-pcr was preformed as described in wang et al.  <cit> , using a abi  <dig> real-time pcr system , and the ratio of p. capsici dna to cacao dna in the infected tissues was calculated as two to the power of the difference between ct numbers ).

RESULTS
isolation of a putative tcnpr <dig> gene
initially, a partial tcnpr <dig> gene was identified by screening a bac library by hybridization with a partial tcnpr <dig> sequence. based on this sequence, pcr primers were used to amplify cdna isolated from cacao genotype scavina <dig>  stage c leaves. a fragment of 1764 bp was isolated, cloned into pgem vector and sequenced to reveal an intact coding sequence of the expected length and with high homology to the arabidopsis npr <dig> gene.

subsequently, a genomic sequence containing a putative tcnpr <dig> gene was identified by searching a cacao genome database   <cit>  using the full-length cacao npr <dig> cdna as a query for the blastn algorithm  <cit> . the structure of the tcnpr <dig> gene  was deduced by comparing the full-length cdna and genomic sequences using spidey software tool   <cit> , which revealed the presence of four exons and three introns, similar to the genomic structure of arabidopsis npr <dig> .

arabidopsis and cacao npr <dig> protein sequences are highly similar
conceptual translation of the tcnpr <dig> predicted transcript resulted in a putative protein sequence consisting of  <dig> amino acid residues, only one amino acid longer than arabidopsis npr <dig>  alignment of the tcnpr <dig> and atnpr <dig> protein sequences demonstrated that they are highly similar to each other . arabidopsis and cacao npr <dig> share key structural features . both proteins have a btb/poz domain near their n-terminus  that shares 64% identity and an ankyrin repeat region  which shares about 72% identity. it has been shown that both btb/poz domain and ankyrin repeats are involved in protein-protein interactions  <cit> . these similarities in protein structure suggested that tcnpr <dig> gene may also share the same function as atnpr <dig> in the regulation of the defense response.

expression of tcnpr <dig> in cacao tissues
rt-q-pcr was performed to investigate the expression level of tcnpr <dig> in various cacao tissues, including leaves from sequential developmental stages a, c, e, representing young, mid and mature stages of development. in addition, rna was isolated from open flowers, un-opened flowers, roots, seeds and fruit exocarp. tcnpr <dig> is constitutively expressed at varying levels, in all tissues tested , similar to the arabidopsis npr <dig> gene  <cit> . tcnpr <dig> basal expression levels were relatively low in seed and moderate in floral tissues and young and mid-development leaves . its expression was high in roots, exocarps and mature leaves .

tcnpr <dig> complements the arabidopsis npr3- <dig> mutation
our earlier work has shown that the arabidopsis npr <dig> mutant phenotype includes a enhanced level of floral disease resistance and significantly reduced whole plant fitness  <cit> . to explore the function of tcnpr <dig>  we introduced the cacao npr <dig> cds under the control of a constitutive promoter into arabidopsis npr3- <dig> mutant transgenic plants, and tested its ability to complement the npr <dig> mutant phenotype.

as compared to wt arabidopsis, which is highly susceptible to pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc <dig> , floral infection resulting in shortened siliques and reduced seed production, the primary phenotype of arabidopsis npr3- <dig> mutant is normal silique and seed development regardless of the inoculation of pathogen  <cit> . to test if tcnpr <dig> overexpression in the npr3- <dig> mutant can complement this phenotype, the floral infection assay was carried out with five individual tcnpr <dig> transgenic lines, col- <dig> and npr3- <dig> mutant arabidopsis plants. we inoculated young developing flowers with p.s.t and disease symptoms and bacterial growth were assayed. in water-treated inflorescences, we did not observe any phenotypic differences in any of the different lines . seven days after inoculation, the p.s.t.–treated col- <dig> plants were more susceptible than npr3- <dig> mutant plants, which showed impaired flower development and shorter siliques consistent with our previously reported results  <cit> . to evaluate the expression of the transgene, rt-pcr was performed using flowers of five independent transgenic lines along with wild-type arabidopsis col- <dig> and the npr3- <dig> mutant controls. as expected, tcnpr <dig> expression was not detected in either col- <dig> or the npr3- <dig> mutant, but five independent transgenic lines all showed heterologous expression of tcnpr <dig> . all five individual transgenic lines exhibited intermediate levels of silique development after pathogen inoculation relative to col- <dig> and npr3- <dig>  to quantify these differences, the length of siliques of each infected inflorescence was measured in four biological replicates . the mean silique length of the npr3- <dig> mutant was 11 mm regardless of the presence or absence of pathogen, but the silique length of infected col- <dig> was significantly reduced to 1 mm. all five independent transgenic npr3- <dig> lines overexpressing tcnpr <dig> exhibited intermediate silique lengths, ranging from 3 mm to about 8 mm. the inoculated silique length of line  <dig> is statistically the same as col- <dig>  but all the other lines are significantly longer than col- <dig> but shorter than in npr3- <dig> mutant plants.

to further evaluate the effect of the tcnpr <dig> transgene in the complementation lines, we quantified bacterial titers in infected floral extracts. a decrease of bacterial colonization of about 60-fold was observed in the npr3- <dig> mutant as compared to col- <dig> . although line  <dig> exhibited the same statistical level as npr3- <dig> mutant, two of the transgenic lines  showed a level close to that of col- <dig>  the other two lines  also supported significantly more bacteria than npr3- <dig> mutant though the level was not as high as in col- <dig>  in all, four out of five transgenic lines exhibited significantly higher bacteria levels than in npr3- <dig> mutant, again suggesting that tcnpr <dig> can at least partially complement npr3- <dig> mutant phenotype. the tcnpr <dig> protein only partially complemented the npr <dig> mutant, most likely because of the heterologous nature of the interactions between tcnpr <dig> and the arabidopsis defense response machinery. it is also possible that tcnpr <dig> has functions that differ from those of atnpr <dig>  to gain further evidence to support these conclusions, we tested tcnpr <dig> function directly in t. cacao, using a transient expression system.

knockdown of tcnpr <dig> in cacao leaves results in enhanced disease resistance
our expression data revealed that tcnpr <dig> is expressed at moderate to high levels in leaves depending on developmental stage . to test the function of tcnpr <dig> in cacao leaves, we knocked down its expression in cacao leaves by expressing an artificial microrna via agro-infiltration. we predicted that if npr <dig> functions as a repressor of the npr1-dependent defense response in cacao leaves, reduced npr <dig> transcript would result in increased pathogen resistance proportional to the npr <dig> expression level. to test this hypothesis, a 21nt inverted repeat-hairpin construct was created based the design of arabidopsis mir <dig>  <cit>  which was placed under control of an enhanced camv35s promoter. the artificial tcnpr <dig> microrna construct was expressed in cacao leaves by agrobacterium-mediated transient transformation via vacuum infiltration. native npr <dig> transcript levels were reduced up to 50% two days after transformation . to explore the effect of npr <dig> expression on the ability of cacao leaves to respond and defend against pathogen infection, we inoculated the leaves with the cacao pathogen phytophthora capsici. three days after infection, lesions were formed in both control and npr3-microrna expressing leaf pieces . average lesion sizes were significantly reduced to about one-half those on controls . to test the ability of pathogen to replicate on the leaves, we quantified the ratio of phytophthora to cacao genomic dna in the infection zones by rt-q-pcr or specific target genes, which further demonstrated that the tcnpr3-mircorna transgene significantly reduced pathogenicity .

discussion
the resources resulting from the complete genome sequence of theobroma cacao were used to efficiently characterize the npr1-like gene family of cacao  <cit> . we discovered a total of four npr-like genes in the cacao genome. we previously reported that tc09t <dig> encodes tcnpr <dig>  a functional ortholog of arabidopsis npr <dig>  <cit> . this report extends those findings to provide several lines of evidence supporting our hypothesis that tc06t <dig>  encodes the functional ortholog of the arabidopsis npr <dig> gene. two independent experiments testing tcnpr <dig> function were consistent with a role in suppression of the npr1-dependent defense response pathway . the tcnpr <dig> gene complemented the npr <dig> mutant phenotype, which includes a dramatic increase in disease resistance. the fact that the complementation was only partial is not surprising, considering the large evolutionary distance of cacao and arabidopsis. it is likely that specific protein-protein interactions between tcnpr <dig> and arabidopsis components such as npr <dig>  or tga <dig> might not be as strong as in homologous interactions, and thus we observed only partial complementation. however, our data suggest that the mechanisms and molecules involved in npr3-dependent signaling pathway in arabidopsis are at least partially conserved with cacao. in a homologous test system, a cacao mirna efficiently reduced endogenous tcnpr <dig> mrna expression, and this in turn resulted in increased resistance to pathogen infection, consistent with the function of npr <dig> as a repressor of the defense response.

the pathogen used in our experimental bioassays, p. capsici, is considered to be a hemibiotrophic pathogen, and causes significant losses worldwide  <cit> . our unpublished data showed over-expression of cacao npr <dig> gene can increase the resistance to p. capsici in detached leaf assays, which is consistent with previous findings that npr1-dependent pathway is mainly involved in defense against  biotrophic pathogens.

in arabidopsis, the npr <dig> knockout mutant exhibits a high level of pathogen resistance in developing flowers compared to col- <dig>  wt plantlets  <cit> . this level of resistance is correlated with reduced seed number and weight, likely the result of a physiological cost of heightened defense activation. this clearly illustrates how the cost of resistance drives the selective pressure for evolution of complex and efficient negative regulatory mechanisms. we hypothesize that npr <dig> plays a similar role in cacao. cacao npr <dig> gene expression is low in seeds, moderate in both floral tissues and young leaves, but elevated in the exocarps and stage e leaves . in contrast to the expression pattern or atnpr <dig> in arabidopsis, tcnpr <dig> only expressed at a moderate level in developing flowers, possibly because cacao is self-incompatible plant, so the tissue specificity might be different in this tropical tree. we speculate that evolution has selected for a mechanism that prioritizes resource allocation away from the mature exocarps and leaves, in favor of seeds, flowers and young leaves. this may play an important role for the pathogen moniliopthora perniciosa,  which can infect developing flower cushions and cause hypertrophy and abnormal fruit development.

these findings could be used to guide the screening of cacao germplasm for novel sources of disease resistance that could be incorporated into breeding programs. screening of cacao varieties for lines expressing low levels of npr <dig> transcript could be a rapid method for discovery of potentially resistant varieties. by defining the specific genes and mechanisms involved in cacao disease resistance, and translating these discoveries into tools for germplasm screening and breeding, it will be possible to pyramid multiple genes for resistance into the elite cacao genotypes of the future.

CONCLUSIONS
the isolation of npr <dig> from cacao and its heterologous complementation in arabidopsis npr <dig> mutant allowed us to rapidly confirm its function in the negative regulation of defense response in floral tissues. moreover, the knock down of tcnpr <dig> in cacao leaves via cacao transient transformation resulted in decreased resistance to cacao pathogen phytophthora capsici in detached leaf bioassays. taken together, we conclude that tcnpr <dig> is a functional ortholog of arabidopsis npr <dig> gene. this fundamental finding can potentially help us to breed cacao varieties with enhanced disease resistance by traditional breeding and/or transgenic manipulations, which will benefit farmers, developing countries, the environment and the chocolate industry.
