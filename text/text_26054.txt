BACKGROUND
phloem-feeding aphids are a common pest of important crops world-wide. in temperate regions, approximately a quarter of all plant species are colonized by at least one aphid species  <cit> . in many cases, the highly specialized mode of aphid feeding causes little apparent, but nevertheless significant damage to the plant and it appears that aphids are able to evade plant defenses while moving their stylets intercellularly, as well as manipulate their host through secretion of saliva into the phloem sieve elements  <cit> . sap-sucking insects cause damage in susceptible cultivars, directly by modifying plant metabolism and ingesting plant nutrients and in many cases indirectly, for example, through the transmission of plant-pathogenic viruses  <cit> .

studies using the model plant arabidopsis have provided valuable contributions to our understanding of basal defense mechanisms against aphid feeding  <cit> , whereas the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance gene mediated aphid resistance remain less well understood. the cloning of the mi <dig>  gene in tomato conferring resistance to potato aphid has given us some insight into r gene mediated defense to aphids  <cit> , and with studies in soybean  <cit>  and the model legume medicago truncatula gaertn  <cit>  a picture is emerging around resistance gene-mediated defense against aphids. for example, these studies have shown the recruitment of specific defense signalling pathways in resistant, but not susceptible plants  <cit> .

cowpea aphid  is a serious pest in legume agriculture and has been reported on all continents except the antarctic. this species has been described as the most important worldwide pest of cowpea, vigna unguiculata l. walpers, causing significant yield losses when either young seedlings or the pods of adult plants are attacked  <cit> . cowpea is a protein-rich legume relied on by over  <dig> million people in africa and is highly adapted to poor soils and drought conditions. in recent years, cowpea genetic resources have been developed to aid breeding efforts to improve the crop with a focus on drought tolerance and resistance to diseases, nematodes and pests including cowpea weevil , thrips , cpa and viruses vectored by cpa  <cit> .

cpa also causes serious yield losses in chickpea, a major pulse crop in the indian sub-continent, where transgenic chickpeas expressing the allium sativum leaf agglutinin  gene resulted in a significant reduction in survival and fedundancy of cpa  <cit> . cpa has also been reported to be a pest on peanuts in africa, where it vectors several viruses which cause groundnut rosette disease  <cit>  and can also be a serious pest of lentils on the indian subcontinent  <cit> . in australia, cpa has been reported to infest pasture legumes such as subterranean clover , common burr medic , alfalfa , barrel medic  as well as australia’s major grain legume, narrow leaf lupin ;  <cit> . in the us, this aphid species has become a more serious pest of alfalfa in the last decade where high population densities of cpa in alfalfa have been reported in over  <dig> states  <cit> . apart from resistance to cpa in lupins  <cit>  and several resistance loci in cowpea, most of which have been overcome by newly emerged cpa biotypes  <cit> , natural resistance to cpa has not been identified in other cultivated legumes including medicago species.  <cit> .

the most common aphid species recorded on legumes in australia include: bluegreen aphid , pea aphid , spotted alfalfa aphid , spotted clover aphid , green peach aphid  and cowpea aphid . in recent years resistance to most of these aphid species has been identified and characterised in the model legume medicago truncatula gaertn  <cit>  with the exception of cpa resistance. resistance to bga, pa and saa in m. truncatula are controlled by single dominant genes and were identified in a pair of closely related lines   <cit> . no resistance to cpa was found in this pair of closely related lines and neither in two other pairs of closely related lines ,  <cit> .

the south australian research and development institute houses the largest collection of m. truncatula accessions comprising over  <dig> different accessions collected from the mediterranean basin since the 1960s. a random selection of  <dig> individuals constituting the m. truncatula core collection were analysed for genetic diversity and relationship using six simple sequence repeats   <cit> . this subset of  <dig> individuals has already proven to be a genetically diverse set with various sources of resistance to different isolates of necrotrophic fungal pathogens  <cit> .

here we screen a subset of  <dig> m. truncatula accessions present in the different clades of the phylogentic tree of the  <dig> individuals of the genetically diverse core collection to identify potential sources of cpa resistance. one accession, sa <dig>  showed enhanced resistance to cpa in comparison to all other m. truncatula accessions tested. the cpa resistance in accession sa <dig> was characterised and involves antibiosis, antixenosis and tolerance. electrical penetration graph  studies reveal that resistance is phloem based and genetic analysis identified a major quantitative trait locus  on linkage group  <dig>  explaining 39% of the antibiosis resistance phenotype. these results lay the groundwork for further molecular and biochemical elucidation of this agriculturally important trait in a well-developed plant model system.

RESULTS
screening of m. truncatula accessions for resistance to cpa
to assess whether there is any natural resistance to cpa in m. truncatula, a subset of the sardi core collection of m. truncatula accessions was assayed for its performance following cpa infestation. seventeen genetically diverse accessions representing each of the major clades in the phylogenetic tree of the sardi core accessions generated by ellwood and associates  <cit>  were selected and included accessions a <dig> and borung, previously identified by gao and colleagues  <cit>  as being susceptible to cpa. in an initial no choice glasshouse screen we found very few differences in the performances of the plants, with all accessions surviving cpa up to five weeks post infestation. borung, sa <dig> and sa <dig> eventually succumbed to cpa infestation after six weeks. typical aphid infestation phenotypes in m. truncatula following infestation with aphids other than cpa, such as necrotic flecks on local leaves or systemic vein chlorosis on uninfested leaves were not observed. most accessions showed severe stunting and wilting, and damage symptoms appearing as yellowing patches or leaf chlorosis surrounding the aphid infestation sites within  <dig> week after infestation, with the exception of sa <dig> 

in contrast to the plant phenotypes, there were some distinct differences in the population sizes of cpa on the different accessions with a notably lower population density on sa <dig> . in a subsequent short term infestation experiment the performance of cpa nymphs over a four day period was monitored and this reflected the plant damage and aphid densities observed at four and five weeks post infestation . the cpa nymph population had a significantly lower mean relative growth rate  on sa <dig> compared to all other accessions tested, with the exception of sa <dig> . no significant differences between the accessions were found for the survivorship of cpa nymphs over this four day period .

alatae prefer susceptible line borung over resistant line sa30199
observation of host choice by alatae  can reveal clues to mechanisms of aphid resistance, such as whether antixenotic  factors are present and the speed with which they influence behavior of a foraging aphid. in the host-choice test, alatae quickly dispersed from the point of release in the centre of the cage and moved around the cage prior to settling on a plant. the average number of settled alatae increased in both borung and sa <dig> plants up to  <dig> h after cpa release, suggesting there was no immediate effect of an antixenotic factor . after  <dig> h, the number of aphids on sa <dig> started to decline, whereas the number of alatae settled on borung throughout the 72-h time course increased significantly , suggesting a host preference by cpa.

resistance in sa <dig> is exerted through the phloem
the electrical penetration graph technique is a powerful method to observe in real time the locations and activities of aphid stylets during probing, including their salivation into sieve elements and passive uptake of phloem sap  <cit> . representative traces produced by cpa probing on borung and sa <dig> are presented in figure 3a and 3b. the proportions of time that tethered apterae spent outside the cuticle , penetrating between cells en route to the vascular tissue , contacting xylem, derailed stylets or briefly puncturing cells  did not differ significantly between borung and sa <dig> .

in contrast to events prior to successful puncturing of the phloem sieve element, the proportion of time spent by cpa secreting saliva in the sieve element  and the subsequent ingestion of phloem sap  were significantly reduced for cpa feeding on the resistant sa <dig> plants compared to the susceptible borung plants. whereas the secretion of saliva on borung plants occupied an average of  <dig> % of total recorded activity, it only occupied  <dig> % on sa <dig> plants. similarly, the ingestion of phloem sap on borung plants recorded an average of  <dig> %, whereas on sa <dig> it averaged  <dig> %. in the  <dig> replicates tested for each line, 87% of borung plants had phloem sieve contact, whereas only 63% of sa <dig> had phloem contact. this reduction in salivation into the sieve element and the reduction of phloem sap ingestion in contrast to all the other  activities measured suggests that resistance to cpa is phloem mediated.

resistance in sa <dig> requires an intact plant
the aphid’s performance on shoots excised from the host plant in comparison with an intact plant was tested. excision and maintenance of shoots on nutrient supplemented agar did not cause any visible wilting or other signs of damage during the four day assay. furthermore, the aphids managed to settle on excised shoots, produce honeydew and nymphs as they would on intact plants. there was no significant difference  in aphid survival in any of the treatments . however, the mean relative growth rate of the aphid population on intact plants was significantly lower on the resistant sa <dig> than on the susceptible borung . this resistance in sa <dig> was lost on excised shoots, with aphids growing as well as they did on borung. excision did not significantly affect the mrgr of cpa on borung.

prior infestation does not affect cowpea aphid performance on sa <dig> or borung
to determine whether aphid feeding causes systemic effects on colony development, we compared aphid survival and the mean relative growth rate of the aphid colony either with or without prior infestation of borung and sa <dig>  prior infestation with cpa had no significant effect on survival relative to the no-aphid control treatment for either genotype. similarly, no significant effect on the growth rate of the cpa population relative to the no aphid control was found . therefore, we conclude that the resistance response in sa <dig> does not appear to induce a systemic resistance response effective against subsequent infestations of the same aphid species.

resistance in sa <dig> is controlled in part, by a major quantitative trait locus  on chromosome 2
for genetic analysis of cpa resistance, we used f <dig> hybrids and f <dig> populations from reciprocal crosses in which sa <dig> was the aphid-resistant parent and borung the aphid-susceptible parent. the f <dig> hybrids were assayed for cpa resistance and showed an intermediate resistance level between the parents sa <dig> and borung as shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  a total of  <dig> f <dig> individuals  were phenotyped for their response to cpa by weighing the aphid population  <dig> days after placing two apterous adults on each individual plant. aphid colony weights differed markedly between parental controls  and the distribution of the log transformed aphid weights of the f <dig> population followed a normal distribution using the shapiro-wilk test .

to identify the region controlling cpa antibiosis in sa <dig>  qtl analysis was performed using the cpa colony fresh weight data. this analysis identified a highly significant locus with a lod score of  <dig>  explaining  <dig> % of the phenotype for cpa fresh weight  on chromosome  <dig> . no other qtls for cpa colony fresh weight were identified.

discussion
the use of m. truncatula as a model system to characterize and determine the genetic basis of aphid resistance provides an opportunity to improve resistance to sap-sucking insects in agriculturally important legume crops, where aphids can be significant problems  <cit> . the use of this system has already lead to the identification of single dominant and semi-dominant resistance genes for bga, pa and saa  <cit> . besides these resistance genes, quantitative trait loci controlling different aspects of aphid resistance  have also been identified in m. truncatula for bga and pa  <cit> . while no resistance to cpa has previously been identified in m. truncatula, only three pairs of closely-related lines of m. truncatula were assayed and no significant differences were identified following cpa infestation  <cit> . the present study screened a subset of the sardi core collection of m. truncatula accessions, that span the genetic diversity in this collection, for resistance to cpa. one accession, sa <dig>  was found to have an increased resistance to cpa compared to all other m. truncatula accessions tested with the exception of sa <dig> . in initial no choice glasshouse screens, no visual differences were found in plant performance, with all m. truncatula accessions showing degrees of stunting and wilting, and no obvious other macroscopic phenotypes such as local necrotic flecks as observed following bluegreen aphid or pea aphid infestation in some m. truncatula accessions  <cit>  or systemic vein chlorosis as seen following spotted alfalfa aphid infestation in susceptible m. truncatula accessions  <cit> . however, distinct differences in the population sizes of cpa on the different accessions with a notable lower population density on sa <dig> was observed and confirmed in a subsequent short term experiment, where cpa had a significantly lower mrgr on m. truncatula sa <dig> compared to all other m. truncatula accessions tested .

host selection by alatae is regarded as the first stage of colonisation and therefore plays a major role in aphid establishment in the field. in repeated host choice experiments with alatae of cpa, we found that the alatae preferentially settled on the susceptible accession borung compared to the resistant sa <dig> from 48h after release . this is in contrast to the response of bga in similar experiments where a clear preference for the susceptible line a <dig> compared to the resistant line jester was visible within  <dig> h of release  <cit> . however, the response of pa in a similar experiment using the lines jester and a <dig> showed a similar result in host preference as seen for cpa with the settling preference only becoming apparent after  <dig> from release  <cit> , suggesting antixenosis is involved in the response and is likely derived from the inability to establish a successful feeding site.

in electrical penetration graph  studies using adult cpas, a reduction in salivation into the sieve element and a reduction of phloem sap ingestion on resistant sa <dig> plants compared to susceptible borung plants were identified. these significant differences, in contrast to the all other  activities measured, suggest that resistance to cpa is phloem mediated. this combined with the host choice results also suggest the antixenotic effect of resistance, observed in the choice test, may be derived from the inhibition of sap uptake rather than cues from volatile compounds or surface waxes from sa <dig>  this is supported by the proportion of time that tethered apterae spent outside the cuticle, penetrating between cells en route to the vascular tissue, contacting xylem, derailed stylets or briefly puncturing cells, which did not differ significantly between borung and sa <dig> . the similarities between the behaviour of the aphids for these activities suggest that neither surface features  nor cell wall properties play a role in the resistance mechanism of sa <dig>  feeding behaviour of cpa was also examined in narrow-leafed lupin, where cpa spend significantly more time in non-probing and stylet pathway activities and significantly less time in the phloem sieve element on the resistant cultivar kalya compared to the susceptible cultivar tallerack  <cit> . similarly, resistance to cpa in cowpea resistant cultivar icv- <dig> compared to susceptible cultivar icv- <dig> showed a reduction in the phloem sieve element phase  <cit> . in all three cases a phloem-based deterrence therefore plays the major role in cpa resistance. similar experiments conducted in m. truncatula lines resistant and susceptible to bga and pa revealed significant reductions in phloem feeding on the resistant lines and therefore all the identified aphid resistance in m. truncatula to date appears to be exerted through the phloem  <cit> .

if cpa resistance in sa <dig> is based on phloem properties, the causal factor may be produced locally. this could be achieved by either a physical blockage of sap uptake at the feeding site through rapid polymerization and deposition of macromolecules such as callose or phloem proteins or by biosynthesis of resistance factors in the vicinity of aphid feeding sites. however, our finding that shoot excision eliminates cpa resistance in m. truncatula sa <dig>  raises the possibility that a resistance factor imported from the root or a root to shoot signal could be required to retain cpa resistance. the loss of phloem-based resistance to cpa on excised shoots of sa <dig>  has also been observed in the resistance to bga and pa in the m. truncatula accession jester  <cit> . reciprocal grafting experiments between sa <dig> and borung will be necessary to confirm the hypothesis that a resistance factor is imported to the feeding site.

pre-infestation  had no significant effect on subsequent cpa feeding and the growth rate of the cpa population , which is similar to the observations made by gao and colleagues  <cit>  who characterised pa resistance in m. truncatula. however, the cpa and pa findings contrast with bga resistance characterised in m. truncatula, where prior infestation with bga on resistant lines showed a significant reduction in the population growth rate of a subsequent bga infestation  <cit> .

the biology of cpa resistance in m. truncatula sa <dig> shares similarity with resistance to other aphid species in m. truncatula as it involves a combination of antibiosis, antixenosis and tolerance and resistance is phloem based. all the major aphid resistance loci in m. truncatula have been mapped to chromosome  <dig> in regions rich in open reading frames  encoding nucleotide-binding-sites leucine-rich-repeats . the three cloned aphid resistance genes identified to date; the mi gene to potato aphid  in potato, the vat gene to cotton-melon aphid  in melon and the resistance gene to lettuce root aphid  in lettuce belong to the cc-nbs-lrr class of resistance genes  <cit> . furthermore, the ain locus, which explains 88% of the antibiosis resistance in m. truncatula a <dig> to bga and 23% of the antibiosis effect to pa, resides in a cluster of paralogous nbs-lrr genes  <cit> . the major cpa antibiosis qtl was identified on the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  the homologous region spanning the qtl on chromosome  <dig> in the reference genome of a <dig> was queried for the presence of nbs-lrr domains. this identified  <dig> toll-like interleukin  <dig> receptor  and  <dig> cc-nbs-lrr domains respectively. this region is thus not as dense in, but does contain nbs-lrr domains. further fine-mapping and subsequent cloning of this locus will elucidate whether the locus controlling cpa antibiosis belongs to the nbs-lrr class of aphid resistance genes.

CONCLUSIONS
with the frequent breakdown of single dominant r genes in our extensively monocultured agricultural systems, it is important to pyramid multiple resistance genes into crops with major r genes to help inhibit the occurrence of new virulent biotypes. cpa is the most important insect pest of cowpea and also causes significant yield losses in other legume crops including alfalfa, beans, chickpea, lentils, lupins and peanuts  <cit> . here we have identified the first strong antibiosis resistance in m. truncatula against cpa, an economically important legume pest. the identified locus will facilitate marker assisted breeding of m. truncatula for increased resistance to cpa and potentially other closely related medicago species such as alfalfa. using synteny with soybean  and m. truncatula, candidate resistance genes have been identified within mapped qtl intervals in cowpea for macrophomina phaseolina resistance  <cit>  and synteny studies could also help identify homologous genes to the cpa resistance gene  identified in m. truncatula. the identification and characterization of this novel resistance locus to cpa in a model plant further adds to the potential m. truncatula has for studying plant defense against sap-sucking insects. it has proven difficult to introduce resistance from wild relatives into certain cultivated legume species due to sexual incompatibilities and high degrees of autogamy. the m. truncatula-cpa system would allow us to identify key regulators and genes important on the plant side of the interaction to give effective resistance. the homologous genes in cowpea, chickpea and other legume crops could then serve as targets for over-expression to enhance resistance to cpa.

in the last decade, increasing efforts in the area of aphid genomics have been made and include the sequencing of the first aphid genome  <cit> , the availability of numerous est and transcriptome sequence datasets  and rna interference approaches to knock down aphid genes  <cit> . using these resources and the advances in next generation sequencing technology would also allow us to further the development of novel strategies to identify key cpa genes involved in host manipulation to establish a feeding site and/or effectors recognized by the resistance locus. using rnai-based approaches in legume crops targeting these essential aphid genes could lead to effective durable resistance to this destructive pest.
