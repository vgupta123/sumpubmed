BACKGROUND
to conserve an endangered species, we need to provide suitable habitat, shelter, prey items, and other resources . prey availability may be one of the most critical issues, especially for predators with specialized diets
 <cit> . if management plans for endangered species include the restoration of habitat, we need to know if the endangered taxon itself is vagile enough to locate and colonise the newly-available sites. evaluating the likelihood that significant prey species also will colonise restored areas is also important; if they do not do so , otherwise-suitable habitat may be unable to support populations of the endangered taxon.

the broad-headed snake  is a small elapid snake restricted to rocky areas  within a 200 km radius of sydney, in south-eastern australia
 <cit> . these snakes were abundant at the time of european colonisation 200 years ago, but have now disappeared from most of its former range
 <cit> . the threatening processes include habitat degradation and fragmentation resulting from the removal and destruction of critical shelter sites , forest overgrowth
 <cit>  and illegal collection of animals for the pet trade
 <cit> . efforts at habitat restoration have produced encouraging results, with the snakes and their lizard prey rapidly colonising sites by themselves where artificial rocks have replaced stolen natural rocks
 <cit>  and where trimming of vegetation has allowed increased sunlight penetration
 <cit> . however, these studies have focused on sites very close to extant populations of snakes and their prey; the prospectus for successful colonisation of more distant sites remains unclear.

for relatively isolated habitat patches to be colonised, both the snakes and their prey must be able to reach them. landscape-genetic analyses have confirmed that broad-headed snakes often move between adjacent outcrops , and thus are likely to rapidly find any restored habitat patches
 <cit> . the probability of colonisation by the snakes’ prey species has not been studied, and is the subject of the present paper. broad-headed snakes consume a diversity of vertebrate prey taxa, but the most important taxon  is the velvet gecko . indeed, velvet geckos comprised 70% of prey items consumed by juvenile h. bungaroides <cit> . like h. bungaroides, o. lesueurii is restricted to rock outcrops
 <cit> . the predator–prey interaction between these two taxa presumably has been a long-running one, because geckos from populations sympatric with this snake species are reported to display a suite of antipredator tactics not seen in conspecific geckos from populations allopatric to broad-headed snakes . local coadaptation is likely only when gene flow is restricted between populations , allowing the evolution of spatial heterogeneity in relevant traits.

to evaluate the history of this predator–prey interaction, we need to know the timeline not only for the predator’s evolution
 <cit>  but also for the prey’s evolution . because o. lesueurii is an important prey species for h. bungaroides, we also need to evaluate the potential for o. lesueurii to colonise newly restored areas of rocky habitat. we can clarify this issue with a study of landscape genetics  and direct measures of dispersal, based on mark-recapture fieldwork.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analyses and molecular dating
the  <dig> samples of o. lesueurii showed  <dig> haplotypes  of 710 bp. the complete dataset included  <dig> variable sites of which  <dig> were parsimony-informative. as the two phylogenetic methods showed similar arrangements of the main branches, figure
 <dig> only shows the relationship between haplotypes for the ml analyses . three main lineages are present within the study area, the first  including populations from the north and central areas , the second  restricted to populations from the south , and the third  strictly central populations . the mean k2p distance between the lineages was  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> % for a-c, b-c, and a-b respectively.

dating analyses based on the secondary calibration points revealed a first divergence within o. lesueurii about  <dig>  million years ago , with a split between haplotypes within lineages occurring  <dig>  ma ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>   for a, b, and c respectively. dating analyses based on a standard divergence rate of  <dig> %  gave similar results, with a first divergence within the species about  <dig>  ma , with a split between haplotypes within lineages occurring  <dig>  ma ,  <dig>  ma , and  <dig>  ma  for a, b, and c respectively.

population and landscape genetic analyses
overall, the ϕst between populations varied from  <dig> to  <dig>   in oedura lesueurii populations was best predicted by a combination of distance and minimum elevation between sites . the second-best model included the number of rivers, the minimum elevation and the distance between sites . three more models deviated from the best model by less than two units , and all these models include the minimum elevation and the straight-line distance between sites as explanatory variables, further indicating the importance of these parameters. because the true distance between sites was less informative than the straight-line distance , we used latter variable in our analyses .

only mantel and partial mantel tests  with the  <dig> best aic values are shown.

in grey, best model  and models with a Δ aic <  <dig> 

the nucleotide diversity at a site tended to increase with latitude , and we did not detect any significant relationships between nucleotide diversity and the number of samples, the elevation, or the longitude of sites.

the samova revealed high fct values for all the groups and small fsc values in cases of  <dig> to  <dig> groups, indicating very high population structure. for example, at k =  <dig> the majority of variation  is among groups, although  <dig> % of variation at the level of among populations within groups still represents highly significant population structuring in the remaining population groups . at k =  <dig>  the two clusters identified were the populations of lineage b  vs lineages a  and c , and at k =  <dig>  the three clusters were the populations of lineage a, b, and c.

dispersal distances of free-ranging geckos
in total, we obtained records of the distances moved by  <dig> geckos, over time periods ranging from  <dig> to 928 days between recaptures . we used anova to compare gecko movements among regions and between sexes and age classes over time. there were no significant interaction effects, so we only describe main effects. oedura lesueurii was highly sedentary. marked lizards did not tend to move further away from their initial capture site with increasing time , indicating that they have fixed home ranges. there was no difference in mean movement distances between male, female or juvenile geckos , and the average distances moved were less than 30 m . the maximum dispersal distances recorded were  <dig>  km for an adult male,  <dig>  km for an adult female, and  <dig>  km for a juvenile.

discussion
our study revealed ancient genetic divergences within oedura lesueurii from southeastern australia, beginning in the miocene-pliocene  and resulting in three geographically well-defined lineages . similarly, our population genetics analyses showed a strong spatial structure among our  <dig> populations as well as within lineages, with a lack of haplotype sharing between populations separated by only  <dig>  km . in addition, our landscape genetic analyses identified distance as the major barrier to gene flow  between populations. in contrast, an absence of areas with low elevation between sites  favoured dispersal. in this case, areas of high elevation between sites reflects continuous favourable habitat . similarly, gene flow in the broad-headed snake h. bungaroides mostly occurs along sandstone plateaux rather than across the densely forested valleys that separate plateaux
 <cit> . consistent with these genetic analyses, our field data  revealed that o. lesueurii are sedentary. marked individuals typically remained within close proximity  to their original capture site for years, consistent with earlier reports that some females return to their natal sites to lay eggs
 <cit> . previous phylogenetic studies on southeastern australian reptiles  have revealed similar ancient splits between populations.

in both of these taxa, a southern lineage  differs significantly from conspecifics in the sydney area. sumner et al.
 <cit>  suggested that the break between the southern and northern clade of h. bungaroides occurs in a geologically distinctive area where volcanic soils cover the sandstone plateaux
 <cit> , acting as a barrier to gene flow. the same may be true of other sandstone specialist species such as o. lesueurii. the strong genetic structure observed in this study is consistent with general patterns observed in various taxa distributed in eastern australia
 <cit>  and could be attributed to the ancestral position of the mesic biome , and hence allowed localized endemism from long term persistence of populations through multiple climatic cycles
 <cit> . finally, the observed gradient of genetic diversity in o. lesueurii throughout the study area  may be the result of harsher historical conditions in the southern part of the range . the species reaches its current southern distributional limit close to our study sites in morton np
 <cit> .

overall, the diversification of australian geckos is ancient and may have originated from a gondwanan vicariance . in this respect the geckos differ from most other squamates, which colonized australia from asia more recently . similarly, australian geckos show relatively ancient intraspecific diversification . the diversification of at least one of the gecko’s major predators  is much more recent, as the split between the genera hoplocephalus and paroplocephalus occurred less than 3 ma
 <cit> , and the oldest split between h. bungaroides lineages about  <dig>  ma
 <cit> . consequently, o. lesueurii was established across much of its current range in southeastern australia long before the evolutionary origin of h. bungaroides. our results support the plausibility of the conditions required for natural selection to produce adaptive local differentiation in geckos: that is, genetic variation among populations and low gene flow between them
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
from a conservation perspective, the low dispersal rates of o. lesueurii have two main implications. the first is that this gecko will be slow to recolonise any local areas from which it is extirpated . thus, habitat suitability for the endangered broad-headed snake may be spatially heterogeneous as a result of relatively ancient local events that reduced gecko numbers. second, the low dispersal rates of the geckos need to be considered in any management plan that includes the restoration of degraded habitat previously hosting h. bungaroides. the poor dispersal capacity of o. lesueurii  likely will delay or prevent natural recolonisation of geckos in restored areas, unless those areas are very close to extant populations. consequently, we may need to reintroduce o. leseurii to such areas in order to guarantee successful habitat restoration for h. bungaroides.
