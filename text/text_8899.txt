BACKGROUND
banana  is the world’s principal fruit crop, with a production of over  <dig> million tons annually . however, the crop is threatened by fusarium wilt, a fungal disease considered to be one of the most destructive in agricultural history
 <cit> . fusarium wilt, also known as panama disease, is caused by the soil borne fungus, fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense 
 <cit> . the pathogen infects banana roots, colonizes and occludes the xylem vessels, and causes a reddish-brown discoloration of the rhizome and pseudostem. leaves of infected banana plants eventually become bright yellow, before they wilt and collapse around the pseudostem
 <cit> . diseased banana plants often die before they produce bunches, thereby reducing yields in affected fields. once the soil is infested with foc, susceptible cultivars cannot be successfully replanted for up to  <dig> years
 <cit> .

fusarium wilt has destroyed many thousands of hectares of bananas in tropical and subtropical countries
 <cit> . since the 1990s a damaging new variant of foc, referred to as foc tropical race  <dig> , has affected cavendish bananas in the tropics of asia and is considered a major threat to banana production worldwide
 <cit> . various control approaches have been used to combat or manage fusarium wilt of banana. among them, genetic resistance is regarded as the most effective and sustainable management option
 <cit> .

understanding the complexity of disease resistance will contribute to the development of bananas that are resistant to fusarium wilt. the genome sequence of banana is, however, largely unknown, as by april 24th,  <dig> only about  <dig>  banana est sequences were released by the global musa genomics consortium and deposited in the ncbi databases. the publicly available dna data are also not sufficient to explain the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to foc in banana. therefore, extensive transcriptomic data are needed to discover genes related to foc resistance. such data could also serve as a good source for constructing high density microarrays for further characterization of gene expression profiles during banana/foc interaction.

in this study, the transcriptome profiles of resistant and susceptible cavendish banana roots infected with foc tr <dig> were compared. resistance was introduced into the cavendish plants through the process of somaclonal variation
 <cit> . more than  <dig> billion bases of high-quality dna sequences were generated using illumina technology, demonstrating the suitability of short-read sequencing for de novo assembly and annotation of genes expressed in non-model species without prior genome information. in the process,  <dig>  non-redundant unigenes were identified, including hundreds of resistance-related, signaling, and metabolism genes. furthermore, gene expression profiles of banana roots during different pathogen infection stages were compared using a digital gene expression  system.

RESULTS
determining the time-points for harvesting the samples
the differences in disease progression between a resistant cavendish banana mutant ‘brazilian’ and its susceptible wild-type ‘nongke no 1’ were monitored after infection with a gfp-tagged foc tr <dig> isolate. numerous spores were attached to the roots of ‘brazilian’  <dig> h after infection , and most of these germinated and developed into hyphae  <dig> hai . on ‘nongke no 1’ roots, however, only a few fungal spores were found, and only a small number of these spores germinated at  <dig> hai . therefore, two time-points were selected to investigate the genetic basis underlying the differential responses of the two cultivars to infection, namely  <dig> and  <dig> hai.

comparative transcriptome analysis of ‘brazilian’ and ‘nongke no 1’
illumina sequencing
approximately  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million 90-bp clean paired end  reads  were generated for ‘brazilan’ and ‘nongke no 1’, respectively . after the reads were assembled into contigs, scaffolds and clusters successively, they were analyzed for unigenes, of which more than  <dig>  were present in ‘brazilan’ and more than  <dig>  in ‘nongke no 1’ . after the unigenes were merged for dge analysis,  <dig>  non-redundant unigenes that partially overlapped were removed . during de novo assembly, small gaps within the scaffolds containing the least number of unknown nucleotides  were filled in, permitting more than half of the gaps to be filled. the gap distribution for unigenes is shown in figure

* total nucleotides = total reads <dig> x read <dig> size + total reads <dig> x read <dig> size, q <dig> means base quality more than  <dig>  n represents unknown nucleotides.

annotation of non-redundant unigenes
among the  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>   proved to be similar to known protein sequences from arabidopsis thaliana, rice, maize, poplar, and pharbitis nil. annotation of the  <dig>  sequences using gene ontology  and clusters of orthologous group  databases yielded good results for approximately  <dig>  unigenes and  <dig>  putative proteins, respectively .

annotation of defense genes and pathways
to gain a deeper insight into the molecular biology of the defense system in banana, defense-related genes were analyzed. approximately  <dig>  unigenes were found to be homologous to known defense-related genes in other plants. kegg analysis revealed that these unigenes were significantly enriched in various known resistance-relevant metabolic or signaling pathways , which suggests a considerable conservation of resistance-relevant genes and pathways between banana and other plants. these genes and pathways are required for both local and systemic acquired resistance. thus, the involvement of these unigenes in metabolic pathways provides a basis for the further identification of biological functions of candidate genes in the banana responses.

digital gene expression profile analysis after foc inoculation
illumina dge of b, b <dig> and b <dig> , and nk, nk <dig> and nk <dig>  parallel sequencing resulted in  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  million high quality non-redundant tags . gene annotation by tag mapping analysis showed that  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all distinct tags in the six groups could be mapped to the reference database provided by the  <dig>  non-redundant unigenes from the rna sequence based transcriptome analysis.

to analyze the global transcriptional changes in banana infected with foc tr <dig>  the method described by audic et al.
 <cit>  was applied to identify differentially expressed genes from the normalized dge data by pairwise comparisons between the wild-type  and mutant banana  at different time points after infection. to characterize the functional consequences of gene expression changes associated with infection with foc in the resistant mutant, pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed, based on the kegg database using the two-side fisher’s exact test. nine metabolic pathways that are related to immunity were selected for further analysis. the selected pathways included perception of pamps by pattern recognition receptors , effector-triggered immunity , ion fluxes, transcription factors , oxidative burst, pathogenesis-related proteins , programmed cell death , plant hormones and cell wall modification . fifty-two types of differentially expressed genes with known or implicated functions were identified . all differentially expressed unigenes are involved in the recognition of pamps, and the high accumulated levels of defense-related transcripts may contribute to foc tr <dig> resistance in banana . transcriptomic comparison of two differentially expressed unigenes between’brazilian’ and ‘nongke no 1’ is shown in figure
 <dig>  based on the above results, a schematic illustration of plant defense in cavendish banana against foc tr <dig> was constructed . 

discussion
in this study, the plant defense response in banana following infection by the fusarium wilt pathogen, foc tr <dig>  was investigated. the expression patterns of pathogen triggered immunity - and effector triggered immunity -related genes in response to foc tr <dig> infection in the susceptible  and resistant  plant were compared using rna-seq. pti constitutes the first layer of the plant defense response that restricts a pathogen from proliferating
 <cit> . most of the genes related to pti in banana exhibited different expression patterns and levels in the resistant mutant  relative to its wild-type . for instance, the chitin elicitor-binding protein  and the chitin elicitor receptor kinase ; both important components of the plant signaling pathway that recognizes chitin oligosaccharides, a representative general elicitor inducing defense responses in a wide range of plant cells of both monocots and dicots
 <cit> , were up-regulated in ‘nongke no 1’ compared to ‘brazilian’. knockout mutants of either of these genes should be performed to elucidate their role in the defense of banana against foc in future, as it was previously demonstrated that their disruption resulted in the partial impairment of the ability of rice to respond to the chitin elicitor of an incompatible fungus, including mapk activation, ros generation, and disease resistance,
 <cit> .

brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated kinase  <dig>  acts in pti via its interaction with flagellin sensing  <dig> . most known prrs require bak <dig> for function
 <cit> ; bak <dig> is known as somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase  <dig> 
 <cit>  and does not have a direct role in elicitor perception, but fls <dig> rapidly forms a complex with it after elicitation. this interaction results in phosphorylation of both proteins
 <cit> . in nicotiana benthamiana, the bak1/serk homolog has a direct role in elicitor perception of bacterial cold shock protein, flagellin, and elicitin, but not chitin
 <cit> . although we do not know whether similar elicitors exist in foc tr <dig>  in the expression profile, both fls <dig> and bak <dig> had the same expression pattern in both cultivars. both of them were up-regulated upon inoculation in the mutant, and their expression levels were several times those of the wild-type, which indicated that the fls2–bak <dig> complex might interfere with the activation of banana innate immunity.

a common prerequisite in plant innate immunity is elicitor-stimulated activation of cyclic nucleotide gated channels -ca2+ influx, which initiates all subsequent defense reactions
 <cit> . cngc  <dig>  cngc  <dig>  cngc  <dig> and cngc  <dig> mediate this influx after elicitor perception in arabidopsis <cit> . however, in musa, we found that cngc  <dig>  cngc  <dig> and cngc  <dig> changed after pamp perception, which suggested that there is a fundamental difference in the ca2+ influx mechanism between banana and arabidopsis.

compared to the significant increase in the expression of pti genes in the resistant ‘nongke no 1’ banana, the expressions of most r genes, such as cc-nbs-lrr resistance protein, nbs-type resistance protein, were very low, except for the rin4/rpm <dig> complex. in a. thaliana, rpm <dig> conferred resistance to pseudomonas syringae expressing either avrrpm <dig> or avrb <cit> . avrb and avrrpm <dig> cause hyperphosphorylation of the rpm <dig> interacting protein  <dig> 
 <cit> , and these modifications are perceived by rpm <dig>  which subsequently triggers disease resistance
 <cit> . the different expression of the rin4/rpm <dig> complex in the resistant cavendish banana compared to the susceptible wild type may be one way of explaining the resistance in the mutant plant. . this result is consistent with findings in the knockout mutant of a. thaliana . although rps <dig> was expressed at a low level in banana, elimination of rin <dig> or inhibition of the expression of rin <dig> by unknown effectors from foc tr <dig> will activate the rps <dig> pathway. the effectors secreted by foc tr <dig> remain unknown, and the presence of a similar effector to avrrpt <dig> requires further investigation.

pamps and eti are known to induce rapid production of ros  in an oxidative burst after treatment with a pathogen, which is largely derived from the activity of membrane-localized nadph oxidases
 <cit> . nadph oxidases  were activated and up-regulated in the resistant banana in response to foc tr <dig> infection, which is in agreement with previous observations in wheat, cotton, and cucumber after infection by the fusarium wilt fungal pathogen
 <cit> . we also investigated the expression of ros-scavenging systems, such as catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and etc., and found that most of them had a higher expression in the susceptible wild-type. this suggested that there was a higher level of ros in the mutant, which inhibited the colonization of the pathogen on the root.

both bags and aif had higher expression levels in the susceptible cultivar than in the resistant mutant, which indicated that pcd was increased by foc tr <dig> attack in the wild-type, which conflicts with the low concentration of ros. delledonne
 <cit>  reported that nitrogen monoxide  and ros together, but not individually, are required to induce hr-mediated cell death, and that the balance between no and h2o <dig> needs to be further investigated
 <cit> .

the salicylic acid , jasmonic acid  and ethylene  hormone pathways are important regulators of defense-gene expression
 <cit> . we first analyzed the sa signaling-related genes, and did not find significant differences between the two cultivars, which indicated that it did not play a role in the resistance response and was in agreement with the suggestion that sa is not involved in resistance to necrotrophic pathogens, such as foc tr <dig>  the core ja-signaling component jasmonate zim-motif  proteins tify10b-like gene and a jasmonate inducible protein, extracellular superoxide dismutase 2+, were induced in the mutant at all time points, while it was expressed in the wild-type only in trace amounts. additionally, the expression levels of lipoxygenase -like and allene oxide synthase -like unigenes indicated that endogenous levels of ja in the resistant mutant were much higher than in the wild-type. for the ethylene signaling genes, such as transcription factors ethylene insensitive  <dig>  and ethylene insensitive 3-like  <dig> , transcription levels in the mutant plant were much higher than those in the wild-type. this suggests that resistance to the necrotrophic pathogen foc tr <dig> is mediated by the ja and et signaling pathways, and not the sa pathway.

the plant cell wall not only serves as a physical barrier, but also as a defense barrier against pathogen penetration. expressions of 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase , 4-coumarate: coa ligase , polyphenol oxidase , glutathione s-transferase , udp-glucuronic acid decarboxylase and cellulose synthase, which act at different steps of the shikimate-phenylpropanoid-lignin and cellulose biosynthesis pathways, were up-regulated in the compatible interaction after infection of foc tr <dig>  their expression, however, was not affected in the incompatible interaction. this result is not consistent with previous reports
 <cit> , which proved that the above pathways were induced in incompatible infection, but did not change or was repressed in the compatible interaction. in wheat and watermelon, resistance to necrotrophic fungus is executed after penetration, and the density of the intercellular hyphae and the number of haustoria were greatly reduced in an incompatible compared with the compatible interaction . however, in banana, resistance to foc tr <dig> appeared to occur before colonization, as was demonstrated in the current study where the amount of spores attached to roots of the resistant mutant was substantially reduced. in the susceptible ‘brazilian’ banana, however, a large amount of foc tr <dig> spores colonized and germinated on the roots.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we characterized the root transcriptome of banana and provided a comparative dge analysis of the compatible and incompatible interaction between banana and foc tr <dig>  these findings provide a substantial contribution to existing sequence resources for banana, and a strong basis for future genomic research. the differentially expressed genes and putative signaling pathways generated in the present study revealed that the defense system of banana may be more complex than previously believed. the findings of this study will hopefully accelerate research on resistance in banana to foc tr <dig> and contribute to a better understanding of the banana defense response to plant pathogens. many defense-related genes and pathways in banana differ from those in model plants such as rice and arabidopsis, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying host defense in plants may be variable. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of illumina sequencing technology for banana root transcriptome de novo sequencing and assembly without a reference genome. among the generated sequences,  <dig>  unigenes were specifically expressed in the incompatible interaction. these genes could play an important role in the interaction of banana and foc tr <dig>  and their spatial and temporal expressions require further study.
