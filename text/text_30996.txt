BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small , single-stranded, noncoding rnas that have recently emerged as important regulatory factors during growth and development in eukaryota. to date, mirnas were described in animals, plants, and viruses . mirnas are processed from longer precursor rnas transcribed by rna polymerase ii that form stem-loop structures, in which the mature mirnas reside in the stems. in animals, long primary transcripts  are first cropped in the nucleus by an rnase-iii homolog drosha to release the hairpin intermediates  in the nucleus. following their export to the cytoplasm, pre-mirnas are subjected to the second processing step, which is carried out by another rnase iii homolog dicer. in plants that lack drosha, it has been suggested that mirna processing is executed by dicer-like protein  <dig>  . mirnas down-regulate gene expression by binding to complementary mrnas and either triggering mrna elimination or arresting mrna translation into protein. thus far, mirnas have been implicated in the control of several pathways, including developmental timing, haematopoiesis, organogenesis, apoptosis, cell proliferation and possibly even tumorigenesis . however, the mechanisms of mirna generation and function are still poorly understood and the molecular details are only beginning to be revealed.

hen <dig> was identified as a gene that plays a role in the specification of stamen and carpel identities during the flower development in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . mutations in hen <dig> resulted in similar defects to those observed for mutations in caf, suggesting that they are both involved in mirna metabolism  <cit> . recently, it was found that the product of hen <dig> is a methyltransferase  that acts on mirna duplexes in vitro and methylates the last nucleotide of both strands in the substrate  <cit> . it was found that the methylation by hen <dig> protects plant mirnas against the 3'-end uridylation and the subsequent degradation  <cit> . both the 2'-oh and 3'-oh groups of ribose on the last nucleoside were found to be essential for methylation by the hen <dig> protein, hence they are both considered as the possible methylation sites, they may also play a crucial role in the process of substrate recognition  <cit> . the 2'-oh group is the most commonly methylated target in rna, while 3'-methylated ribonucleosides have not been identified  <cit> . however, it remains to be determined which of the oh groups of the last nucleoside of the mirna/mirna* duplex is the target of methylation by hen <dig>  of note, hen <dig> and its homologs analyzed in this article are completely unrelated to a human gene hen <dig> that encodes a 20-kda neuron-specific dna-binding polypeptide  with the basic helix-loop-helix  motif.

hen <dig> is a long protein , which was found to comprise a putative double-stranded rna-binding motif  in the very n-terminus and a c-terminal domain , which exhibits significant similarity to a group of uncharacterized protein from bacteria, fungi, and metazoa  <cit> . these proteins are however much shorter – they lack the dsrm and the long central region of hen <dig>  hen1-ctd was found to be related to the rossmann-fold mtase  superfamily, suggesting that it is responsible for the rna mtase activity of this protein  <cit> . it is noteworthy that sequences of hen <dig> and its homologs are so strongly diverged from other proteins that initially hen <dig> was not recognized as a mtase homolog when it was discovered  <cit> . thus, apart from generic features common to all mtases, the molecular mechanism of specific interactions of hen <dig> with its substrate rna remains unknown. in particular, the three-dimensional structure, the identity of potential catalytic and substrate-binding residues, and the phylogenetic origin of hen1-ctd have not yet been inferred. we have therefore carried out bioinformatics analyses to collect the possibly most complete set of hen <dig> orthologs in current sequence databases as well as to identify closest paralogs amongst mtases with known structure and mechanism of action. the results were used to construct a tertiary model of the catalytic domain of hen <dig> and to predict the architecture of the substrate-binding region and the active site.

RESULTS
sequence analyses of hen1
in order to identify orthologs of a. thaliana hen <dig>  we used its full-length sequence as a query to search the non-redundant  protein database using psi-blast  <cit>  as well as genomic databases using tblastn  <cit> . a complete homologous sequences with significant similarity to the entire query was found only in oryza sativa . we also searched the est and genomic databases using tblastn  <cit>  and found sequences from several different plant species that covered various segments of the query, but from which we could not assemble any contiguous fragment that would cover the full-length protein. only the htg sequence from lotus corniculatus var. japonicus  displayed similarity to the entire query sequence, but we decided to omit it from further analyses due to uncertainties in positions of intron-exon boundaries .

to identify domains in the primary structure of hen <dig>  we carried out an rps-blast search of the cdd database of conserved domain alignments  <cit> , which confirmed the presence of the n-terminal dsrm, albeit with low score  and the c-terminal rfm domain , but did not reveal any new domains in the large central region. therefore, we divided the hen <dig> sequence into a set of overlapping sequence fragments <  <dig> aa and submitted it to the genesilico protein structure prediction metaserver  <cit>  to carry out predictions of secondary structure, protein order/disorder and possible three-dimensional folds . fragments of 100– <dig> aa with apparent similarity to conserved domains were resubmitted as individual jobs.

to study the origin of the hen <dig> enzyme, we carried out additional searches of the non-redundant sequence database using only hen1-ctd , with a stringent e  value threshold of 10- <dig>  the search converged in the 4th iteration, revealing a family of sequences with well-conserved regions along the entire sequence. all sequences with scores below that threshold were reported with significantly shorter alignments and a preliminary visual analysis suggested that they lacked many of the residues apparently conserved among the close homologs of hen <dig>  they were also annotated as involved in distinct processes , hence they were regarded as potential paralogs.

for the purpose of analyzing the orthologs of hen1-ctd, all sequences reported with the e-values better than the threshold of 10- <dig> were retrieved and automatically aligned using muscle  <cit> . this initial alignment was refined manually  to remove redundant sequences. members of sequences from different phylogenetic lineages  were used as queries in additional tblastn searches of the dbest database and of finished and unfinished genomes, to identify additional members of the hen <dig> family and also to refine some of the sequences from the initial alignment, which seemed to exhibit deletions due to overlooked exons etc. the final set comprised  <dig> sequences, including  <dig> members from metazoa,  <dig> from fungi,  <dig> from viridiplantae, and  <dig> from bacteria. figure  <dig> shows the final multiple sequence alignment  of the hen <dig> family, which was refined based on the results of structure prediction and evaluation of the sequence-structure fit on the three-dimensional level .

to identify closest paralogs  of hen <dig>  we converted the multiple sequence alignment of the hen <dig> family into a profile-hidden markov model  using hhpred  <cit>  and we compared it with similar profile-hmms pre-calculated for protein families collected in the clusters of orthologous groups  database  <cit> . interestingly, hhpred analysis suggested that the closest relatives of hen <dig> are not mtases acting on nucleic acids, but enzymes acting on small molecules. the top three matches that obtained significantly higher similarity scores than other families, were: cog <dig> , cog <dig> , and cog <dig> . the fourth match, with already significantly lower score was cog <dig> . the best-scoring nucleic acid mtase family on the list of hen <dig> homologs was found only on the fifth position  methyltransferase and related methyltransferases"), with e-value  <dig> *10- <dig>  it is remarkable that no known ribose mtase families were reported at the top positions of the ranking.

from the results of the aforementioned psi-blast search queried with the hen1-ctd we retrieved additional sequences reported with e-values 10-20-10- <dig>  we also carried out psi-blast searches for all five aforementioned closest paralogs of hen <dig> to retrieve all or at least a substantial fraction of members of these lineages. we combined all these sequences with hen <dig> orthologs and after removing duplicates found by more than one search, we clustered them based on the pair-wise blast similarity scores using clans  <cit> . we tried different p-value thresholds and found that the value of 10- <dig> produced best-resolved sequence "clans" corresponding to different cogs . figure  <dig> shows that the hen <dig> clan is connected most strongly to the ubig clan , mostly via the bacterial members of the hen <dig> family. in agreement with the results, the two next neighbors, closely related to ubig, are ubie  and cfa , while tam  and trna:m1a mtases  are evidently more distantly related. thus, the catalytic domain of hen <dig> appears to be a close relative of quinone mtases and related small-molecule modifying enzymes  and only a remote homolog of other nucleic acid mtases.

phylogenetic analysis of hen1-ctd
the distribution of hen <dig> family members among different phyla is quite unusual, suggesting that interesting insights into its origin may be obtained from the inference of its evolutionary history. thus, based on the alignment we calculated phylogenetic trees of the hen <dig> family using several different methods. unfortunately, all traditional approaches, including the neighbor-joining, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods failed to produce a tree with well-resolved branches and without erratic grouping of sequences from distantly related species, possibly due to the long branch attraction . therefore, we decided to study relationships within the hen <dig> family using methods that infer a "fuzzy" picture of possible evolutionary connections. figure  <dig> shows the phylogenetic tree of the hen <dig> family generated with splitstree, using the split decomposition method  <cit> . the largest branch comprises most of the metazoan members of the hen <dig> family  with the exception of nematoda. the branch comprising members of three caenorhabditis species  groups together with viridiplantae, but seems to be connected to the main metazoan cluster by the intermediate location of trichuris muris. other main branches are formed by viridiplantae, bacteria, and fungi, with the exception of schizosaccharomyzes pombe, whose position is unresolved.

we have also analyzed similarities within the hen <dig> family by clustering them with clans  <cit> . we have experimentally found that the p-value threshold of 10- <dig> produced qualitatively best results. more stringent values caused disconnection of the most diverged sequences, while more permissive values, such as 10- <dig> used earlier for the analysis of relation of hen <dig> to other cogs, caused over-compaction of the whole dataset into a single cluster with only a few outliers. figure  <dig> shows a representative 2d projection of "sequence clans" obtained after several independent minimizations, starting with random distribution of sequences. this analysis reproduced all the groupings corresponding to taxons outlined by the split decomposition method, but also revealed additional meaningful associations. craniata, urochordata, insecta, hydrozoa, and arachnida form a single central cluster, surrounded by clusters of viridiplantae, fungi, nematoda, and bacteria. interestingly, this analysis revealed association of s. pombe spbc <dig> c with other fungal members of the hen <dig> family . the nematode t. muris appears much closer to the central cluster than sequences from caenorhabditis. this suggests that the caenorhabditis branch underwent accelerated evolution and explains that its peculiar grouping with viridiplantae in the splitstree reconstruction  may be due to the "long branch attraction" artifact. bacteria form a well-resolved, dense cluster, located relatively close to the central metazoan cluster, but with connections also to fungal and plant clusters. finally, the plant cluster comprises the main part  and three outliers, lactuca sativa , gossypium raimondii , and triticum turgidum .

the relationships between different eukaryotic lineages of hen <dig> are in general agreement with the topology of the "tree of life". in fungi they are present both in basidiomycota  and ascomycota , but they appear to have been lost from many lineages, e.g. saccharomycotina. it is noteworthy that hen <dig> orthologs could not be detected in archaea or in primitive eukaryota with fully sequenced genomes, such as alveolata  or euglenozoa . on the other hand, the distribution of hen <dig> homologs in bacteria is very limited and quite erratic . this distribution would suggest that hen <dig> originated in the common ancestor of eukaryota, before the divergence of the viridiplantae and metazoa/fungi branches, and has been transferred horizontally to bacteria. however, the sequences of bacterial members of the hen <dig> family appear to be more similar to the closest paralogous family ubig than the eukaryotic members . this suggests that hen1-ctd could have evolved in bacteria by duplication of the ubig-encoding gene and neofunctionalization of the second copy and only then was horizontally transferred to the ancestor of contemporary eukaryota. in order to fully understand the origin of hen <dig>  it will be useful to characterize the molecular function of the short forms  from bacteria as well as from other eukaryotic species .

structure prediction of the hen1-ctd
in the absence of an experimentally determined protein structure, comparative modeling may provide a structural platform for the investigation of sequence-structure-function relationships. this technique requires a homologous template structure to be identified and the sequence of the modeled protein  to be correctly aligned to the template. the c-terminal catalytic domain of hen <dig> showed distant similarity to many different structures of class-i mtases in standard database searches. it is known, however, that despite the common fold and conserved cofactor-binding site, different subfamilies of mtases exhibit significant differences in the architecture of their substrate-binding pocket and the active site . thus, modeling of hen <dig> based on a randomly selected mtase structure could introduce large errors in the functionally most important parts of the protein and mislead the structure-based functional predictions.

in order to identify the optimal set of template structures for modeling of hen <dig>  we used the fold-recognition  approach, which allows to assess the compatibility of the target sequence with the available protein structures based not only on the sequence similarity, but also on the structural considerations . as mentioned earlier, the sequence of hen <dig> ctd was therefore submitted to the genesilico protein fold-recognition metaserver  <cit> . as expected, all fr methods reported rfm structures as the potentially best templates. interestingly, none of them reported any of the known rna:2'-oh mtase structures from the rrmj/fibrillarin superfamily  <cit>  or actually, any known rna or dna mtases, on top positions of the ranking. instead, all fr algorithms suggested that the potentially best templates for modeling of hen <dig>  are either known small-molecule mtases or uncharacterized proteins from the structural genomics projects, which show strongest similarity to small-molecule mtases. in particular, pdb-blast reported  <dig> kpg  with the score of 2*10- <dig>  ffas  <cit>  reported 1xxl  with the score of: - <dig> , mgenthreader  <cit>  reported 1xxl with the score of  <dig> , sparks  <cit>  reported 1vl <dig>  and 1y8c  with the score of - <dig>  . ultimately, the consensus server pcons <dig>  <cit>  assigned highest scores  to the small-molecule mtase structures 1xxl, 1vl <dig>  and  <dig> kpg, as potentially best templates for modeling of hen <dig>  this result is in very good agreement from the profile-hmm analysis, which suggested that hen <dig> is most closely related to small-molecule mtase families, including those with unknown structures such as ubie and ubig . thus, bioinformatics analyses strongly suggests that hen <dig> ctd exhibits sequence and structural features characteristic for the "small molecule" branch of the mtase superfamily.

comparative modeling of the hen1-ctd
a comparative model of hen <dig> was constructed based on the alignments reported by fold-recognition methods, using the "frankenstein's monster" approach  <cit> . the c-terminal residues 912– <dig> were predicted to be disordered by disopred  <cit>  and pondr  <cit>  , and therefore they were omitted from the analysis. the final model comprising residues 694– <dig> was constructed by iterating the homology modeling procedure , evaluation of the sequence-structure fit by verify3d, merging of fragments with best scores, and local realignment in poorly scored regions. local realignments were constrained to maintain the overlap between the secondary structure elements found in the mtase structures used as modeling templates, and predicted for hen <dig>  this procedure was stopped when all regions in the protein core obtained acceptable verify3d score  or their score could not be improved by any manipulations, while the average verify3d score for the whole model could not be improved.

the refined alignment between hen <dig> and the templates is shown in figure 6; the corresponding model obtained the average verify3d score of  <dig> . inspection of the quality of the local structures using the colorado3d server  <cit>  revealed only one large region of poorly scoring residues: the insertion comprising aa 829– <dig> . this region is known to be variable in rfm mtases  and in the structures of many small-molecules solved to date it was found to form a substrate-binding pocket. . since template-based modeling of this insertion produced unsatisfactory models, we decided to model it de novo, using rosetta  <cit> . the well-scored parts of the model  were kept unchanged, while the region 829– <dig> was allowed to re-fold, using the rosetta scoring function to identify physically sound, low-energy conformations . figure  <dig> shows the superposition of representatives of the five largest clusters , obtained from the analysis of  <dig> rosetta decoys. the coordinates in the pdb format, both for the initial model and for the alternative models generated with rosetta are available as supplementary data . although the conformations of the region modeled de novo shows substantial differences, in all models they assume a partially helical structure, which forms a wall of the potential substrate-binding site . all analyzes of sequence-structure-function relationship described below, such as the mapping of residue conservation onto the structure were carried out for all five models. the results were qualitatively similar, hence for the sake of clarity we present here the analysis for only the model with the best verify3d score  <dig> .

model-based identification of amino acid residues important for substrate-binding and catalysis
analysis of the sequence alignment of hen <dig> homologs  in the light of the model reveals the functional role of conserved residues and suggests the potential mechanism of ligand-binding and catalysis . relatively easy to infer from the sequence alignment alone is the binding site for the methyl group donor s-adenosyl-l-methionine , which is strongly conserved in nearly all members of the rfm superfamily  <cit> . in hen <dig> it comprises residues from motif i and the gly-rich loop , which provides the structural framework for the binding pocket, motif ii – d <dig> predicted to coordinate the 2' and 3'-oh groups of the ribose moiety, and motif iii – s <dig> predicted to coordinate the n <dig> group of the adenine moiety. on the other hand, the active site of rfm enzymes is typically conserved within families, but not necessarily between families. different families often have different active sites, adequately to the requirements of the reaction mechanism. for mtases acting on large molecules such as nucleic acids, the substrate-binding site is even more difficult to predict, as it can vary greatly even between members of the same family  <cit> . in the absence of obvious close homologs with similar function , the structural context greatly helps to infer the role of residues from motifs iv-viii.

the evolutionary information from the multiple sequence alignment of hen <dig> homologs was mapped onto the surface of the modeled hen <dig> structure using the consurf server  <cit> . figure  <dig> reveals that conserved residues cluster together in the cofactor-binding pocket, as well as in the predicted substrate-binding site, formed by the common motifs iv, vi, viii, and the additional motif specific to hen <dig> . mapping of the electrostatic potential on the protein surface  reveals that the conserved cofactor and substrate-binding pockets are negatively-charged. on the other hand, there are adjacent positively charged patches on the hen <dig> surface, which may be involved in the binding of the negatively charged rna backbone, but they correspond to variable region around motifs iii and x. if a. thaliana hen <dig> binds its mirna substrate using regions that are not conserved among its orthologs, then its substrate specificity may be different than that of other members of the hen <dig> family. however, highly conserved residues e <dig>  e <dig>  h <dig> , h <dig>  h <dig> , and r <dig>  h <dig>  around the putative active site suggest that at least the mechanism of methylation and probably also the details of interactions with the methylated part of the substrate  may be very similar in all hen <dig> homologs.

in agreement with the type of the template structures used, the spatial configuration of the c-terminal, surface-exposed part of motif iv of hen <dig> at the bottom of the putative substrate-binding pocket is characteristic for small-molecule mtases. in particular, the peptide ehhehh,  forms a small α-helix that is nearly perpendicular to all other secondary structure elements, which is commonly found in small molecule mtases, but thus far has not been identified in any nucleic acid mtase. second, it conforms to the consensus sequence xhhehh found in numerous small-molecule mtases, but is rather dissimilar to motif iv of typical mtases acting on nucleic acids pp tetrapeptide of base mtases  <cit>  or the dxxx motif of ribose mtases  <cit> ). however, hen <dig> contains an invariant glu  at the position commonly occupied by a carboxylate residue that participates in catalysis in nucleic acid mtases , but is rarely present in small-molecule mtases.

the presumed catalytic pocket is also formed by conserved residues from motifs vi and x. interestingly, the n-terminus of motif x in hen <dig> reveals an invariant arg residue , which is located in a position similar to the invariant lys residue in "orthodox" ribose mtases . on the other hand, the surface-exposed c-terminal end of motif vi  is characterized by the pattern tpnxen, which bears no similarity to its counterparts in other mtase families. in particular, it does not contain a lys residue conserved and essential for catalysis in "orthodox" ribose mtases , which is proposed to position the hydroxyl oxygen toward the cofactor methyl group  <cit> . thus, the k-d-k triad of residues from motifs x, iv, and vi found in "orthodox" ribose mtases  <cit>  is definitely not conserved in the hen <dig> family, although there is certain resemblance between the chemical character of invariant residues k175/d <dig> in vp <dig> and r701/e <dig> in hen <dig> 

comparison of the putative active site of hen <dig> with the ribose mtases from the spout superfamily is even more difficult, as these proteins exhibit different folds and by definition do not share any homologous residues. the catalytic mechanism of spout mtases is also much less understood than the mechanism of the rfm superfamily members, in part because of the lack of structural information on enzyme-substrate interactions. nonetheless, several residues identified by the analysis of crystal structures and multiple sequence alignments have been found to be indispensable for the ribose mtase activity  <cit> . in particular, it has been proposed that the invariant arg residue from one subunit in the spout dimer  is involved in steering the 2'-oh group of the target ribose towards the cofactor  <cit> , in analogy to k <dig> in vp <dig>  <cit> . here, we predict an analogous role also for r <dig> in hen <dig>  important for the catalysis in spout mtases are also two asn residues  that probably make contacts with the base of the methylated nucleoside. this role could be fulfilled by t <dig> and/or n <dig> from motif vi in hen <dig> 

summarizing, we predict that the active site of hen <dig> comprises r <dig> that orients the target hydroxyl group, e <dig> that stabilizes the cofactor and/or aids in deprotonation of the attacking oxygen atom. other invariant or highly conserved residues of hen <dig> such as t <dig> and/or n <dig> may be involved in binding of other regions of the substrate mirna molecule . these predictions can be tested by site-directed mutagenesis of the respective residues.

CONCLUSIONS
it is remarkable that the predicted catalytic pocket of hen <dig> is different from the "k-d-k" active site triad of known ribose 2'-o-mtases from the rfm superfamily, e.g. vp <dig>  rrmj, or fibrillarin  <cit>  even though these proteins share the three-dimensional fold with the hen <dig> ctd. the active site of hen <dig>  is of course also different from the active site of ribose 2'-o-mtases that belong to the unrelated the spout superfamily, e.g. trmh  <cit> . this suggests that ribose mtases evolved independently at least  <dig> times. such independent origin of a particular type of mtase has been postulated also for enzymes that generate m7g in mrna, rrna, and trna  <cit> , m1g in rrna and different positions of trna  <cit> , and m2g in different positions of trna  <cit> . thus, convergent evolution of the reaction specificity appears to be very frequent among rna mtases. unfortunately, thus far crystal structures of enzyme-substrate complexes are not yet available for comparison of any of these apparent functional analogs among base mtases. among ribose mtases, only a crystal structure of a vp39-rna complex  <cit>  is available, which has served as a template for functional analyses of other members of the rrmj/fibrillarin variety  <cit> , as well as unbound forms of structurally unrelated but functionally analogous enzymes from the spout superfamily . hence, until a high resolution structure of hen <dig> or one of its homologs is obtained , our model will serve as a convenient platform to study sequence-structure-function relationships in this enzyme and its relation to other mtases.

our analyses reveal that hen <dig> shares a number of structural features and most likely a closer phylogenetic origin with small-molecule mtases rather than with other known rna mtases. the phylogeny of hen1-ctd suggests that the ancestor of this protein family appeared already before the divergence of plants and animals/fungi, by duplication and subfunctionalization of a small-molecule mtase similar to ubig. perhaps the ancient hen1-ctd has been transferred to eukaryota by horizontal gene transfer from a bacterium.

it remains to be determined if the additional region present only in the plant members of the hen <dig> family and composed of the dsrm domain, la-like domain, unknown central domain, and ppi-like domain, is essential for the mtase specificity for the mirnas and what is the exact role of the individual domains. it is interesting to note that this extension is present only in hen <dig> from a. thaliana and o. sativa and not in hen <dig> orthologs from other organisms. it can be speculated that dsrm and la-like domains may be responsible for substrate binding by the orthodox hen <dig> from plants. so far, no mirnas have been identified in bacteria. besides, in mirnas from c. elegans or d. melanogaster no 2' or 3'-methylation was found  <cit> . this suggests that the non-plant orthologs of hen <dig> may be involved in methylation of some other substrates, which is particularly relevant given that hen <dig> has apparently evolved from small-molecule mtases. functional characterization of the short hen <dig> orthologs, especially identification of their preferred substrates, and mutagenesis of the putative rna-binding domains of plant hen <dig> delineated in this work may shed the light on the evolution of specificity determinants in this interesting family of enzymes. it would be exciting to elucidate the evolutionary pathway leading from a small-molecule mtase to a nucleic acid mtase.
