BACKGROUND
studies of molecular evolution and the genetic basis of physiological adaptations to extreme environments are limited by the lack of comparative genomic resources including non-model species. species of the bear family  are interesting and important organisms for research in molecular evolution, comparative physiology and conservation biology, but relatively little genetic sequence information is available among species. a major family in the order carnivora, it consists of eight extant species: giant panda, spectacled bear, and six species within the ursus genus . the phylogeny of the bear family has been intensively studied using mitochondrial genomes  <cit> , selected nuclear gene markers  <cit> , or fragmented nuclear dna sequences  <cit> . however currently, there are only  <dig>  nucleotide sequences from the ursidae family in the ncbi database, mostly corresponding to mitochondrial genes. the genome sequence of the giant panda , a species that split off from the ursus bear genus about  <dig> million years ago   <cit> , was released after the completion of this study  <cit> . the availability of large-scale genomic resources for a bear species should facilitate the study of molecular evolution in the bear family and development of population genetic markers to address conservation issues.

bears are of interest for the study of the molecular and genetic basis of mammalian hibernation. brown bear  and black bear  of both sexes hibernate, and females of polar bears , hibernate when pregnant  <cit> . hibernation is an energy saving adaptation that is utilized by at least seven orders of mammals to survive in unpredictable or seasonally extreme environments  <cit> . entry into hibernation is signified by profound reduction in whole animal metabolism , regulated decreases in body temperature, heart beat and metabolic rates that persist over hibernation seasons that can span nearly eight months. most hibernation studies conducted so far have focused on the hibernators of small body sized such as ground squirrels   <cit>  and marmots   <cit> . however, bears  demonstrate a unique pattern of winter hibernation as they remain at relatively high body temperatures and, although they keep quiet and largely immobile, they are capable of arousing and moving throughout the four-eight month hibernation period. during hibernation, bears do not eat, urinate, or defecate  <cit> . they hibernate with a 20-50% reduction in metabolic rate and the reduction of heart rate from  <dig> bpm to  <dig> bpm  <cit> . although they are largely inactive during hibernation, they show no loss in bone mass and less loss in muscle mass and function than is anticipated over such a prolonged state of immobilization  <cit> . in contrast to the near-freezing body temperature in small-sized hibernators  only decrease to 30-36°c. the periodic temperature cycling in hibernating bears is also much less than in the torpor-arousal cycle of ground squirrels. our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate bear hibernation could lead to creating novel therapies for treating human conditions related to resistance to trauma and recovery during rehabilitation.

to develop genomic resources for the american black bear , the most common and widely distributed bear species in north america, we have constructed cdna libraries and sequenced nearly  <dig>  expressed sequence tag . an initial study utilizing these ests to construct cdna arrays and detect gene expression changes during bear hibernation has been reported elsewhere  <cit> . in this study, we focus on the in-depth analyses of the bear ests collection to obtain the first insights into biological functions, alternative splicing, tissue-specificity of expression, and molecular evolution of genes in the bear genome.

RESULTS
bear est sequencing and alignments on the dog genome
a total of  <dig>  est sequences from ursus americanus were generated from cdna libraries in brain, liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and testis  using a normalization-subtraction method . est lengths ranged from  <dig> -  <dig>  base pairs , average  <dig> bps .

to identify the relative genomic positions and the splicing patterns of bear ests, we mapped these  <dig>  ests onto the dog genome by using the procedure described in  <cit> . dog  separated from bears by about  <dig>  mya  <cit> . bear ests were first masked by repeatmasker  <cit>  and aligned on the dog genome, downloaded from ensembl, by blastn  <cit> . sim <dig>  <cit>  was used to identify splicing sites in corresponding blast-hit segments .  <dig>   bear ests can be mapped on the dog genome. the distribution of the percentage of identities between the aligned bear ests and dog genome is shown in figure s <dig> . on average, bear est sequences demonstrated a  <dig> % sequence identity with dog.

we further clustered the aligned bear ests with the help of annotated dog mrna transcripts. the clustering process was based on the shared splice sites or the length of overlap, i.e. two sequences were clustered together if they shared at least one splice site at the same orientation, or if they overlap more than half of the length of the shorter sequence on the genome. after clustering, we obtained  <dig>  "primary est clusters". the redundant "primary est clusters" that aligned to multiple genomic loci were further merged together. finally, we obtained  <dig>  "unique bear est clusters". we selected the primary cluster with the most ests to represent "unique bear est clusters". most of the unique bear est clusters  are singletons, i.e. containing only one est. the average number of ests per unique bear est cluster is  <dig> . the distribution of numbers of ests per unique est cluster is shown in figure s <dig> . the low est copy number per est cluster and high numbers of unique est clusters indicate that normalization subtraction method used in cdna library construction has substantially increased transcript diversity in our est project.

the remaining  <dig>  ests that failed to be mapped onto dog genome were assembled into  <dig>  est clusters by cap <dig>  <cit> . most  of these est clusters were singletons. the average number of ests per cluster is  <dig> . in contrast to the est clusters mapped on dog genome, these clusters mostly represent rare transcripts.

est annotation
all bear ests were aligned against human refseq mrnas http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ by blastn. a blast score higher than  <dig> was used as the criterion of homologous match. annotation revealed that  <dig>   ests matched human gene symbols. a total of  <dig>   "primary est clusters" corresponding to  <dig>   "unique bear est clusters" were annotated with human gene symbols. for the remaining "unique bear clusters", the longest est in each cluster was aligned against ncbi nt database, which contains a much boarder collection of nucleotide sequences. using alignment score higher than  <dig> as the cutoff, we annotated  <dig> "unique bear est clusters" with known gene symbols. among the  <dig>  "unique bear est clusters" without annotation, only nine contained more than five ests and seven had an alignment score higher than  <dig> when aligned with nt sequences. this suggested that they were mostly rare unknown transcripts. in total, we obtained  <dig>   "unique bear est clusters" with known gene symbols.

for the ests that did not align onto the dog genome, the contig sequences generated by cap <dig> were aligned against the nt database with blastn and a cutoff of score higher than  <dig> was used again. a total of  <dig>   est clusters were annotated with known gene symbols.

a total of  <dig>  est non-redundant clusters from black bear were annotated with known gene symbols and submitted to panther  <cit>  for functional annotations. a total of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  genes were classified according to biological process, molecular function, and biological pathway, respectively. genes involved in  <dig> categories of biological processes were significantly over-represented  in the est collection   <cit> . "protein metabolism and modification" and "intracellular protein traffic" categories were the most significantly over-represented in terms of biological processes. genes involved in the two categories, "olfaction" and "chemosensory perception", of biological processes were significantly under-represented. genes assigned to  <dig> categories of molecular functions were significantly over-represented in the est collection. the "oxidoreductase" category was the most significantly over-represented molecular function, whereas "g-protein coupled receptor" category was significantly under-represented . there was no biological pathway category that passed the criterion  to be significantly enriched.

tissue-specific bear gene expression
we used est copy numbers from brain, liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and testis as an approximate estimate of gene expression level across these five tissues  <cit> . we performed fisher's exact test on  <dig> clusters with at least  <dig> ests and identified  <dig> tissue specific clusters under the criteria . among them, six,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and one clusters are brain, liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and testis-specific, respectively. their expression levels estimated by est copy numbers are shown in figure 2a. myosin heavy chain  <dig>  and troponin i type  <dig> , involved in muscle contraction, were significantly over-represented in skeleton muscle. albumin , involved in fatty acid transport, was significantly over-represented in liver. growth associated protein  <dig> , associated with neuronal growth cones, demonstrated highly brain-specific expression. myosin light chain  <dig> , associated with cardiac myosin beta chain, was over-represented in heart.

to compare our results with tissue specific gene expression in other mammals, we downloaded gene expression profiles estimated from est copy numbers of human , mouse , rat , dog  and pig  from the ncbi unigene database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/unigene. data on expression of  <dig> homologous genes were obtained in all six species across the same five tissues . we first calculated the pearson correlation coefficients  in pair-wise comparisons of gene expressions as estimated from est copy numbers between species for each tissue. the gene expression is highly conserved in liver across species with average correlation ⟨r⟩ =  <dig> , while the correlations are much lower in the other four tissues with ⟨r⟩ as  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  for heart, skeletal muscle, brain, and testis respectively. we also calculated the correlation coefficients in pair-wise comparisons between tissue gene expressions among species for each gene. a total of  <dig> genes had consistent expression profiles between bear and at least one out of five other species . only  <dig> out of  <dig> genes are highly consistent in tissue specific expression profile between any two species among all six species. for example, apolipoprotein a-i , a major component of high density lipoprotein, was significantly over-represented in liver in all six mammals. proteolipid protein  <dig> , encoding the most abundant myelin protein in the central nervous system, was highly expressed in brain in all six mammals. however, most of other studied genes demonstrated species-specific patterns of expression across tissues.

analysis of splicing variants
alternative splicing is an important mechanism that generates transcript diversity. it is estimated that 94% of genes may undergo alternative splicing in humans  <cit> . the alignment of bear ests on dog genome provided the opportunity to reveal alternative splicing patterns in bear. after removing all ambiguously spliced and non-spliced bear ests, we obtained  <dig>  unique bear est clusters with at least two spliced bear ests containing  <dig>  bear ests for alternative splicing analysis. a total of  <dig> clusters  showed alternative splicing and  <dig> alternative splicing events were classified into four typical alternative splicing patterns  <cit> : alternative 5' site , alternative 3' site , exon skipping , and intron retention  .

to estimate the proportion of conserved splicing events between bear and dog, we compared the spliced patterns in bear with those in annotated dog mrna transcripts. there are  <dig>  unique bear est clusters containing at least one spliced bear est and at least one spliced dog mrna transcript. among  <dig>  splice sites in these clusters,  <dig>   of them can be also found in dog mrna transcripts and  <dig>   of  <dig>  unique bear est clusters contain splice sites completely identical to those in dog mrna transcripts.

kim et al.  <cit>  reported that exon skipping is the most abundant alternative splicing events in human, mouse and rat, and that intron retention is the rarest event. to compare our results to alternative splicing pattern in other mammals, we normalized our est database as described in kim et al.  <cit>  by randomly selecting the same number of ests from the est collection . we observed that about 42% unique bear est clusters were alternatively spliced, consistent with previous findings in other mammals  <cit> . our result revealed that alternative 5'site had the highest occurrence , followed by alternative 3'site , exon skipping , and intron retention . the proportions of four typical alternative splicing patterns in four mammalian species are shown in table  <dig>  frequency of alternative splicing patterns in bear was not significantly different from distribution of splicing events in other mammalian species .

the percentages of four alternative splicing patterns in human, mouse and rat were extracted from eddo kim's paper  <cit> . the result for bear was obtained after the normalization.

est coverage of protein-coding regions
to estimate the coverage of protein-coding regions in the bear est collection, we selected spliced bear ests with identical splicing sites with spliced dog transcripts or unspliced ests overlapped with unspliced dog transcripts. we discarded dog transcripts with ambiguous start and stop codons. bear ests aligned on more than one gene or completely fell into the non-coding regions were also discarded. finally, we obtained  <dig>  bear ests and calculated the positions of 5' and 3' ends of bear ests on dog transcripts. for these ests, the average coverage of protein-coding regions was  <dig> %. in total,  <dig>  ests contained complete protein coding regions, corresponding to  <dig> ensembl-annotated dog genes. the distribution of the coverage of protein coding regions was shown in figure 4a. there is no obvious bias towards 5' or 3' end of protein-coding regions in bear ests .

molecular evolution in bear
the phylogenetic relationships between bear and other mammalian species have been previously inferred from mitochondrial sequences and a few selected nuclear gene markers  <cit> . thus, we had the opportunity to compare the phylogenetic results derived from the bear mitochondrial genes with a phylogeny from a large collection of nuclear genes. a total of  <dig>  bear ests with coding regions were further assembled into  <dig>  est contigs by cap <dig>  the protein-coding regions accounted for 72% of all assembled contig sequences. the high-quality genome assemblies from three other mammalian species: cow, dog, and human were downloaded from ensembl. orthologous gene annotations were obtained from ensembl-compara database. multiple sequence alignments of orthologous genes were generated by muscle program.

maximum likelihood method was used to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree of the four species from a concatenated alignment of the coding regions of  <dig>  nuclear genes and  <dig> mitochondrial genes respectively with the gtr nucleotide substitution model after multiple hit corrections . the phylogenetic tree derived from the bear nuclear genes has the same topology as the one derived from mitochondrial genes. then, ka  and ks  values of each lineage were calculated under the free ratio model in paml package . although there are considerable variations of ka and ks among different mammalian lineages as estimated from nuclear genes as well as mitochondrial genes, the ratios between ka and ks  from nuclear genes showed smaller variation among species compared to mitochondrial genes. ka/ks in the bear lineage estimated from nuclear genes was compatible with those in other lineages , indicating that the selection constraint in bear did not show significant differences from other mammals on the global nuclear genomic scale.

rates of evolution were estimated from the alignment of concatenated nuclear and mitochondria coding sequences;  nonsynonymous substitution per codon;  synonymous substitution per codon.

next, we searched for specific genes with rapid evolutionary rates in the bear lineage using the likelihood ratio test implemented by paml program. in total,  <dig> genes had significantly higher ka/ks values ) in the bear lineage than in the other lineages . after manually checking the alignments, the results of  <dig> genes with coding sequence  coverage larger than 80% were listed together with their biological functions in table  <dig>  they are involved in diverse biological functions including pnpla <dig> in lipid catabolism, cdc42se <dig> in cell cycle, and tmed <dig> in vesicle-mediated transport. in particular, three genes: phospholamban , cysteine glycine-rich protein  <dig> , and troponin i type  <dig> , are involved in heart contraction. pln inhibits cardiac muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2+ pump when it is unphosphorylated. upon pln's phosphorylation, ca2+ pump will be activated leading to muscle relaxation. defects in pln in human are a cause of dilated cardiomyopathy 1p . csrp <dig> is expressed specifically in heart . csrp <dig> is associated with regulation of heart contraction and skeletal muscle development. defects in csrp <dig> are a cause of dilated cardiomyopathy 1m . tnni <dig> is the cardiac protein of troponin i, the inhibitory subunit of troponin. troponin i blocks actin-myosin interactions and plays an important role in the relaxation of striated muscle. defects in this gene in human can lead to familial hypertrophic cardiomyophathy type  <dig>  and restrictive cardiomyopathy .

we then used branch-site model to test whether any codon sites of the rapid evolving genes show positive selection signal in the bear lineage. two of  <dig> genes, biphenyl hydrolase-like  and cysteine glycine-rich protein  <dig> , contained codon sites with the ka/ks significantly greater than one  as estimated by the bayes empirical bayes  method  <cit> . we subsequently added protein coding sequences of bphl and csrp <dig> from more mammalian species including cat, mircobat, megabat, alpaca, horse and hedgehog, to the four species and tested whether this would affect the results of positive selection detection. the candidate site  in bphl still showed  <dig> % probability of being positively selected. bphl has hydrolase activity and may be involved in detoxification process. the putative positive selected site  in bphl fell in the signal peptide domain. for csrp <dig>  although the bear lineage still showed a higher ka/ks value comparing to the rest of the phylogeny , the candidate site  was identified now with a lower probability  of being positively selected along the bear lineage. the putative positive selected site  in csrp <dig> fell in the zinc-binding domain. the multiple alignment of csrp <dig> protein sequences was shown in figure 5a and corresponding nucleotide sequence alignment shown in figure s <dig> . there was also the substitution of valine by isoleucine at the 60th codon in cat lineage. we obtained 3-d structure of human csrp <dig> proteins from protein data bank  database . the amino acid change from valine  in human, cow, horse, microbat, megabat, alpaca, and dog to threonine  in bear at 60th amino acid may potentially affect the structure of its n-terminal lim domain. this is likely to change the conformation of domain by introducing a polar interaction between a hydroxyl group of the threonine and the zinc ion . in contrast, the substitution by isoleucine, another aromatic acid, at this site in the cat lineage would not change the conformation of lim <dig> domain as much as the threonine substitution does in bear lineage. experiments in human have demonstrated that the altered conformation of csrp <dig> from the mutations at 44th, 55th and 58th site in lim <dig> domain can lead to a decreased binding activity of muscle lim protein  to α-actinin and titin-cap   <cit> . mlp/t-cap complex is a key component of cardiac mechanical stretch sensor system. the defect in csrp <dig> may result in human dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure  <cit> .

evolution rate of hibernation-related genes
the phylogenetic distribution of hibernating and non-hibernating species is wide-ranging and interspersed. it is highly unlikely that hibernation phenotype has arisen independently in these hibernating species. so far, there has been no evidence for the creation of novel genes responsible for hibernation phenotype. therefore, it is more likely that hibernation results from the differential expression of existing genes that have widely and long existed among mammals  <cit> . to address whether bear genes involved in hibernation were evolving faster or slower, we identified hibernation-related genes as those genes that showed significant differential expression on cdna arrays between bears sampled during hibernation and non-hibernation season   <cit> . among the  <dig> genes that we identified as fast-evolving genes in bear, there were four hibernation-related genes: apoh , pln , rbm8a , and atp6v1f . rbm8a was over-expressed during bear hibernation, while the other three genes were under-expressed.

to further examine the selection pressure on hibernation-related genes on a global scale, we compared the ka/ks ratios  between hibernation-related genes and other bear genes. the distributions of ka/ks values of hibernation-related and other genes are shown in figure  <dig>  we observed that hibernation-related genes showed a significantly lower ka/ks values in heart  and skeletal muscle  compared to the rest of the genes, indicating a stronger level of evolutionary constraint on them. this result was also consistent with our previous observation that the proportion of genes involved in protein biosynthesis and translation process was significantly elevated among the over-expressed genes during hibernation  <cit> . most of these genes such as ribosomal proteins are housekeeping genes and typically experience highly negative selection  <cit> . thus, the genes that control key physiological processes in bear hibernation tend to be more conserved rather than fast evolving.

web-based ursus americanus est database
a web-based ursus americanus est database with a user-friendly interface was constructed to provide assess to the bear est collection and demonstrate our analysis http://www.picb.ac.cn/bearest/bearest.jsp. the queries of bear est ids, annotations, tissue sources, and splicing patterns on the dog genome are available on the website.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we reported the first collection of  <dig>  ests of american black bear from normalized subtracted cdna libraries constructed from five tissues, brain, liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and testis. assembling these ests onto dog genome yielded  <dig>  "unique bear est clusters" indicating that our gene discovery strategy has resulted in wide coverage and low redundancy of the est collection. functional annotation and enrichment analyses showed that the est collection represents genes with diverse biological functions. some of genes showed significant tissue-specific expression that is comparable with tissue-specific expression of their orthologous genes in other mammalian species. we also studied frequencies of four most common alternative splicing patterns in the bear ests sequences  <cit> . similar to in other mammals, intron retention is the least common alternative splicing event in the bear. however, alternative 3' or 5' splicing site, instead of exon skipping in other mammals, are the most frequent splicing events in bear.

this first large-scale bear est project provides a valuable genomic resource to study molecular evolution in bear phylogeny. using the bear est collection, we compared the selection pressure exerted on nuclear genes in the bear with those in other mammalian species and identified the genes showing fast evolutionary rate in the bear lineage. these genes have broad biological functions such as metabolism, cell cycle, and vesicle-mediated transport. three of these genes  are associated with cardiac muscle contraction. two of these genes, bphl and cspr <dig> contain codon sites showing positive selection signal in the bear lineage. the analysis on the 3d structure of csrp <dig> zinc-binding domain indicates that this bear-specific amino acid substitution in csrp <dig> may have a significant impact on its structure. as several heart disease-related mutations have been observed in the same domain in csrp <dig>  it is tempting to suggest that this bear-specific substitution may confer adaptive advantage for bear heart during biological processes such as hibernation. however, molecular evolution leading to adaptation is a complex issue and all fast-evolving and putative positive selected genes identified in this study may or may not be related to hibernation per se in bear. the real biological functions and implications related to these genes have yet to be demonstrated. genes differentially expressed during hibernation showed signs of higher negative selection pressure comparing to other genes. this provides supportive evidence for the hypothesis that the hibernation phenotype results from differential expression of conserved genes, rather than rapid evolutionary origin of novel hibernation specific genes. future research combining gene expression studies, functional studies, and genome sequencing will shed new light on the evolution of molecular functions in bear species.
