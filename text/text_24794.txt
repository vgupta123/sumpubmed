BACKGROUND
pea , an important cool-season legume crop, is both a source of dietary protein for animal feed and human food and a beneficial crop in cropping systems  <cit> . for these reasons, pea is destined to play a central role in sustainable agriculture. the development of this crop requires higher and more stably yielding varieties. the tools for molecular breeding in pea are currently scarce, despite its adoption as a model species for genetics since mendel's era  <cit> . a broad range of dna markers has been developed in pisum including microsatellite  <cit> , retrotransposon-based  <cit> , and gene-anchored markers  <cit> . these markers have been used for diverse purposes: to build consensus genetic maps  <cit> , survey genetic diversity  <cit> , and detect quantitative trait loci   <cit> . each of these types of marker presents advantages and drawbacks. retrotransposon-based markers reveal numerous loci at a time but are dominant. gene-based markers used until recently low-throughput technologies genotyping one single locus at a time, but they do allow assessment of synteny with other legume species  <cit> . microsatellite markers have been the most widely used in the recent years, due to their large number of alleles per locus and their facile use by single pcr. however, genotyping of large populations using this technique is still expensive and time consuming.

different genotyping technologies have recently been developed to take advantage of the wealth of single nucleotide polymorphisms  present in all eukaryotic genomes. in humans, snps make up about 90% of all human genetic variation and occur every  <dig> to  <dig> bases along the 3-billion-base human genome  <cit> . similar studies in chicken showed a mean diversity of about  <dig> snp every  <dig> bases for almost every possible comparison between  <dig> lines  <cit> . in plants, snp are also very frequent, although their frequency seems to vary from one species to another. zhu et al.  <cit>  reported a frequency of nucleotide change of one snp every  <dig> base pair  on average in soybean while this frequency was found to be higher in maize   <cit> . in pisum, jing et al.  <cit>  reported one snp every  <dig> bases in intronic regions using a set of  <dig> accessions representing the wild diversity of the genus. snp markers, even though mostly bi-allelic, can be easily used for genetic and association mapping, to structure genetic diversity  <cit>  or for genome-wide selection  <cit> .

many different techniques can be performed to genotype snp markers, from the low-throughput allele-specific pcr  <cit>  to high-throughput methods genotyping hundreds of thousands of snp in parallel. depending on the number of samples and markers of the project to be analysed, medium to high-throughput array-based snp genotyping systems are now available, such as illumina goldengate and infinium, snpstream from beckman coulter, megallele or genechip from affymetrix . the illumina goldengate assay allows genotyping large collections of samples for a large number of snp  over a 3-day period with a high level of multiplexing  <cit> . using two allele-specific primers located on the snp and differentially labelled with cy <dig> and cy <dig>  and a locus-specific primer recognizing both alleles addressed to a micro-bead and identifying the locus through a barcode, the technology allows multiplexed discrimination of the two alleles of any snp locus in a single reaction.

in the last decade, high-throughput snp genotyping has been extensively applied to human  <cit>  or animal panels  <cit> . some studies have also applied high-throughput snp genotyping technologies to plants, mainly cereals  <cit> , but also spruce  <cit>  and legumes like soybean  <cit>  or cowpea  <cit> . most of these studies used the illumina goldengate assay. to date only a few have analysed plant germplasm collections using this technique. for cereals, rostoks et al  <cit>  characterised  <dig> barley genotypes representing mainly the west european cultivated diversity, and akhunov et al.  <cit>  genotyped  <dig> wild or cultivated lines of wheat with  <dig> snp. for legumes, a collection of  <dig> soybean landraces was successfully genotyped with a set of  <dig> snp  <cit> . these technologies always require a preliminary step of snp discovery. the snp detection methods are generally based either on  the discovery of electronic snp in est or shotgun genomic libraries  <cit>  involving large sequencing programs, or  the re-sequencing of pcr amplicons in different genotypes  <cit> .

little genomic sequence data is available for pea , and the number of available est is also limited , if compared to the  <dig> millions and  <dig>  million ests present respectively in the corn or soybean databases. moreover, sequences are rarely present for different genotypes. consequently, a very limited number of snps have been so far identified. in this paper, we compiled data obtained from the re-sequencing of gene fragments for different pea genotypes and from information present in different databases to identify snps and to build a  <dig> snp marker set. we used the illumina goldengate  <cit>  and the veracode technologies on a beadxpress platform  <cit> , and genotyped a mapping population as well as a germplasm collection. this allowed us to test the suitability of this technique for a non-sequenced species, and to assess the efficiency of the defined snp set for mapping or diversity studies in a large germplasm collection including accessions from different pisum species and subspecies.

methods
plant material
two different sets of plants were used for genotyping. the first consisted of one recombinant inbred line  mapping population of  <dig> f <dig> plants , developed by single seed descent from the cross between the genotype 'china'  and the cultivar 'cameor'. the second was a panel of  <dig> pisum accessions from different geographical origins, including modern cultivars, landraces and plants from wild populations, representing both cultivated and wild germplasm diversity . this set also included parental genotypes of published mapping populations, namely ji <dig>  ji <dig> and ji <dig>  <cit> , cv 'terese', k <dig> which is a mutant obtained from torsdag  <cit>  champagne  <cit> , ji <dig> and dp  <cit> . dna was extracted from leaf tissue using a ctab method as described by rogers and bendich  <cit> . the dna concentrations were evaluated using the quant-it dsdna br kit  measuring the pico green fluorescence on an abi <dig> apparatus . dna concentrations were adjusted to  <dig> ng/Î¼l for each sample.

snp discovery and selection
two different strategies were used to identify snps
 firstly, genomic, est or cdna pea gene sequences were selected from genbank or the ipk crop est database http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/cr-est/index.php. primers were then designed on these sequences in order to amplify and directly sequence genomic fragments in  <dig> to  <dig> pea genotypes, as described in aubert et al.  <cit> . the sequences obtained were aligned using clustalw, and potential polymorphisms were checked on the chromatograms.

 secondly, we searched for pea genomic sequences present in genbank for different genotypes. such data has been produced for cross-species legume comparative mapping  <cit> , gene diversity studies  <cit>  or studying a specific gene  <cit> . sequences were retrieved and aligned with clustalw in order to visualize snp.

a preliminary list of  <dig> snps was selected using the beadxpress primer design  using as criterion the absence of any other snp in the  <dig> bp segment flanking the snp analysed and in the  <dig> bp zone located  <dig> bp downstream of the snp. a designability rank score  was calculated for each snp by illumina.  <dig> snp with designability scores between  <dig>  and  <dig>  were finally selected which maximised both the number of genes represented in the set and the diversity when more than one snp was selected for a gene. three primers were then designed by illumina for each snp locus, using the veracode assay designer software. sequence and primer information for the  <dig> snps are listed in additional file  <dig> 

snp genotyping
the goldengate assay is based on the use of  <dig> allele-specific and one locus-specific oligonucleotides per snp locus. after hybridisation of these oligonucleotides on the template dna, an allele-specific extension/ligation step is performed and is followed by a pcr reaction with three universal primers.

pcr products are labelled with cy <dig> or cy <dig> depending on the allele, and contain an illumicode address sequence specific of the locus. each address sequence corresponds to a glass veracode micro-bead, which bears a locus-specific barcode. thereby, every snp locus is identified by its illumicode address and alleles at the snp locus are discriminated by their fluorescent signals. the illumina oligopool assay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol, as described by fan et al.  <cit> .  <dig> ng of genomic dna was used for each genotype, with control dna of genotypes 'cameor' and 'china' on each plate. after amplification, the pcr products were hybridized to the veracode beads via the address sequence for detection on a veracode beadxpress reader  <cit> . for each snp, the amplification product for homozygous genotypes displays normally a signal in either the cy <dig> or cy <dig> channels, whereas the heterozygous genotype at this locus should display a signal in both channels. the automatic allele calling was done using the illumina genecall software with a genecall threshold of  <dig> . the software assigns three clusters on a graph based on the fluorescence obtained. different indexes were calculated by the software. several were used to check the automated genotype calling and the sample clustering:  the call rate is the number of snp successfully genotyped for each sample;  the gentrain score evaluates the confidence of the genotyping for one snp on all samples. it depends on the distance between the  <dig> clusters and the fluorescence intensity;  the gene call score  is a confidence score of the genotyping of each point. it depends on the intensity of fluorescence and the distance of the point from the centre of the cluster on the graph. the homozygous and heterozygous clusters were checked visually and revised, and only the most reliable calls were retained. a quality mark was then given to each snp as follows:  failed;  no polymorphism detected;  polymorphism detected but low fluorescence or weak cluster separation and  clear genotyping and good cluster separation but some accessions  were not genotyped or formed a cluster corresponding to a third allele, and  excellent genotyping. the consistency between the snp genotyping obtained using the goldengate assay and the sanger sequencing was checked for each snp on the genotypes for which the sequence was available. this allowed assessment of goldengate genotyping accuracy.

genetic mapping
using  <dig> framework markers from aubert et al.  distributed over all linkage groups, the markers were placed using the try, place and ripple command of mapmaker/exp version  <dig> b  <cit> . default lod and distance threshold were used. the haldane function was used to calculate centimorgan  distances. the map was drawn using mapchart  <cit> .

RESULTS
design of the pea illumina veracode  <dig> snp set
genomic sequence information was obtained in our labs for  <dig> different genes using  <dig> to  <dig> different genotypes. in parallel, we retrieved genomic sequence data available for at least  <dig> genotypes from genbank for each gene. combining these two sources of information allowed us to identify  <dig> snp  in  <dig> genes.

we selected  <dig> of these snps that matched the illumina criterion of absence of other known snps in their vicinity and with sufficient sequence information upstream and downstream of the snp. of these,  <dig> came from the information retrieved from genbank, and  <dig> were new. a designability score was given to each snp by illumina, with the score ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> , where a score <  <dig>  predicted a low success rate, between  <dig>  and  <dig>  a moderate success rate, and >  <dig>  a high success rate for the conversion of a snp into a successful goldengate assay. out of the  <dig> snp,  <dig> had a score >  <dig>  , and  <dig> ranked between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the pea illumina goldengate assay finally consisted of  <dig> snp with a designability rank of  <dig> and  <dig> snp with a rank of  <dig>  . the  <dig> snp markers represent  <dig> different genes involved in various physiological processes such as cold acclimation, nitrogen and carbon metabolism or symbiosis . map positions were known for  <dig> of these genes, with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes respectively placed on linkage groups  <dig> to  <dig> .

polymorphism and allele call for the different snp
for all snps, genotyping was checked visually, using sanger control sequences and taking advantage of the defined allelic structure of the ril mapping population. the snps were graded 0- <dig> according to the quality of the polymorphism detected and to the quality of the genotyping and allele detection . the vast majority of snps  gave a clear genotyping . of these,  <dig> were successful for nearly all accessions . thirty one snp had either an ambiguous cluster separation or a low gentrain score . thirteen did not show any polymorphism . three hypotheses can be invoked to explain the absence of detected polymorphism:  false snps, resulting from possible sequencing mistakes  rare snps, not present in our collection of accessions , or  the incapacity of the technique to discriminate a snp at this locus. the absence of cluster separation can be due, for example, to a non allele-specific match of the primers. re-sequencing of these thirteen loci would be needed to distinguish between these hypotheses. fifteen snps could not be genotyped . out of these  <dig> snp,  <dig> had a snp score between  <dig>  and  <dig> , while the score of the  <dig> remaining was over  <dig> .

in the germplasm collection, most of the snp yielded two clear main clusters representing the two homozygous genotypes, with sometimes a small additional cluster in the middle of the graph corresponding to heterozygous genotypes. this was expected for this type of population, mainly constituted of homozygous lines. two examples of such a cluster separation are given in figures 1a and 1c. when the snp was polymorphic between parental genotypes 'china' and 'cameor' and was therefore segregating in the ril population, we observed a similar profile for the ril population  as for the germplasm collection. in these cases, we were able to compare the cluster separation in the ril population and genetic resources collection: a larger intra-cluster variability was often observed when genotyping the collection of  <dig> accessions  as compared to the clusters observed for the same alleles in the ril population , probably due to additional polymorphism near the snp in the genetic resources collection. interestingly, in some rare cases,  <dig> main groups of alleles were detected, the third cluster being positioned between the two first ones at the bottom of the graph. an example of such a cluster separation is given in figure 1e with tne003a7_snp <dig>  the segregation of the third allele of the same snp was observed in the ril population . the sequencing of the corresponding gene fragment in genotypes belonging to the middle cluster showed the presence of a  <dig> bp deletion surrounding the snp locus. this explained the reduced signal obtained for the genotypes with this deletion. in a few other cases , a third null allele was detected in addition to the ones corresponding to the two main homozygous clusters, as for te002g22_snp <dig> . in that case, the cluster corresponding to the null allele was closer to the cluster of genotypes having a "g" base genotype at this snp locus. as this null allele segregated in the ril population , we could observe a perfect co-segregation of this marker with another polymorphic snp of the same gene . sequencing the gene fragment in some accessions exhibiting the null allele showed that they harboured not only the g base at the snp locus but also a mutation downstream of the snp at the penultimate base of the locus-specific primer. the lower fluorescence detected for the genotypes having the mutation is presumably due to the resulting primer mismatch.

genetic mapping of the snp in the 'china' x 'cameor' ril population
in order to investigate the applicability of the snp set for genetic mapping in pea, we genotyped  <dig> f <dig> ril derived from the cross between 'china', a chinese accession, and 'cameor', a european garden pea cultivar. out of the  <dig> snps from the illumina veracode set,  <dig> snps were polymorphic among these two genotypes, representing  <dig> gene sequences. when there was more than one polymorphic snp per gene, the different snps gave similar genotyping results, which confirm the genotyping accuracy as no recombination events are expected in one gene sequence for a population of this size. consequently, only one snp per gene was used for further genetic mapping. the genetic map for pop <dig>  comprised  <dig> loci organised into  <dig> linkage groups. four markers  remained unlinked. seven markers on the top of lgii showed a significant segregation distortion  in the ril population. the average distance between markers is  <dig>  cm, and 65% of the intervals between markers are smaller than  <dig> cm . for  <dig> genes out of the  <dig>  the map position in pop <dig> confirmed previous mapping results . for the  <dig> remaining genes, this is the first report of their position on the pea genetic map.

gene call and allele frequency estimates in the germplasm collection
the germplasm collection consisted mainly of p. sativum ssp sativum accessions, complemented by accessions of ssp elatius, abyssinicum and two p. fulvum accessions. interestingly, call rates  were quite high  and very similar among the different subspecies, including between p. sativum and p. fulvum, indicating that snp markers were successfully amplified and genotyped in diverse germplasm.

in order to provide some information about the usefulness of the  <dig> snps markers for genetic studies, allele frequencies were calculated for each snp in the germplasm collection. as snp with equilibrated allele frequencies are more likely to be polymorphic between two genotypes than snps with rare alleles, this can be a criterion for selecting snps for genetic mapping or diversity survey. the distribution of minor allele frequencies for the useable polymorphic snps was uniform between classes  ,. only  <dig> snps  had minor alleles with frequencies lower than  <dig> .

evaluation of the set to genotype existing mapping populations
in order to evaluate the potential of the snp set for use in genotyping other mapping populations, the numbers of markers polymorphic between ji <dig> and ji <dig>  ji <dig> and ji <dig>  <cit> , terese and k <dig>  a mutant of torsdag  <cit> , ji <dig> and dp  <cit>  and champagne and terese  <cit>  were evaluated, as they are parental genotypes of published mapping populations and are included in our germplasm collection . between  <dig> and  <dig> snps , representing  <dig> to  <dig> genes , were polymorphic in each of the  <dig> populations. depending on the population, between  <dig> and  <dig> markers were potential bridges with the pop <dig> map.

discussion
the goldengate snp assay is well-suited for genotyping a wide germplasm collection
in this paper, we have demonstrated the suitability of a 384-snp goldengate assay, for genotyping both a genetic mapping population and a genetic resources collection of pea. despite the wide diversity of the germplasm collection and the presence of p. sativum wild germplasm and of two p. fulvum accessions, most snp markers were amplified and genotyped. genotyping data were obtained for  <dig> out of the  <dig> snp of the set, a success rate of  <dig> %.  <dig> snps  gave excellent genotyping results according to the criteria defined by close et al. <cit> , which is comparable with the 89% and 90% success rates reported respectively in soybean  <cit>  and in barley  <cit>  using the same genotyping technology. the mean gentrain score, which is a measure of the reliability of the snp detection based on the intra-and inter-distribution of genotypic classes  <cit> , was  <dig> , and was never below  <dig>  for any individual snp . we also compared these two parameters based on the preliminary designability rank given by illumina. the conversion of an snp into a successful goldengate assay is predicted to be unlikely, likely or very likely when the designability rank is  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> respectively. success rate and gentrain scores were both higher for snps with a designability rank of  <dig>  than for the snps with a designability rank of  <dig>  , demonstrating the relevance of this criterion for a preliminary selection of snp.

the reliability of the technique was also evaluated by comparing the results of the goldengate snp genotyping with sanger sequencing data for a few genotypes. the results were consistent between the two techniques in all cases. this is also reinforced by the concordance of genotyping results for different snps of a same gene in the mapping population. our study shows that the goldengate genotyping is very reliable, as also demonstrated in wheat  <cit> . we have also shown that the technique can reveal hitherto undetected genetic diversity, by distinguishing for some snp a third allele in addition to the two previously identified alleles.

in addition, the screening of the snp set on the germplasm collection gives valuable information for selecting for further use snp markers with clear bi-allelic profiles as described by close et al.  <cit> .

an efficient tool for integrating genetic maps
to test the suitability of the snp set for mapping, we genotyped the recombinant inbred line pop <dig> population. we were able to assign the linkage groups obtained by comparing them with the pea composite map previously published  <cit> . two groups corresponded to lgii, while the  <dig> other groups corresponded to lgi, iii, iv, v, vi, and vii. the pop <dig> map covers about  <dig> cm, and represents approximately 70% of the pea map  <cit> . while lg <dig> and lg <dig> were totally covered, some chromosomal regions lacked polymorphic snp markers in comparison to the map cited above, such as the middle of linkage group ii, the top extremity of lgiii, and the bottom extremities of lgiv and lgv. consequently, a few distal markers remained unlinked, for example agpl1_snp <dig> , cwi2_snp <dig> and rbcs_snp <dig>  respectively, at the bottom of lgiv and lgv  <cit> . marker order was conserved without exception for all linkage groups between the pop <dig> map and the map of aubert et al.  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> gene markers from other maps  <cit>  were mapped in pop <dig> to their expected linkage groups, providing anchor markers with these maps. furthermore, information on the map position of  <dig> gene-anchored markers was obtained for the first time. two of these markers, fenr  mapped at exactly the same position. as both related sequences encode for a ferredoxin-nadp reductase, this suggests that both markers correspond either to the same gene, or to two genes duplicated at the same locus. this demonstrates the utility of combining different maps to permit integration of a maximum of mapping data.

to investigate further the potential of the set as a source of new markers for genetic mapping we looked at the predicted number of markers it could provide in five existing populations. our data showed that an average of  <dig> polymorphic snps, representing  <dig> genes, can be expected. out of the  <dig> genes represented in the set,  <dig> were polymorphic in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> populations, showing the usefulness of the set in providing bridge markers and for comparing different pea maps. as the snps are linked to a gene sequence, they are also useful markers for studying synteny with other legume species  <cit> .

although the assay is a good tool for quickly providing a genetic map for a pea mapping population, the number of markers would have to be increased to obtain a saturated genetic map. this can be done either by increasing the number of snps in the set and/or by selecting only snps polymorphic between the parental lines in the panel. in our case, a set of  <dig> random snp generated a map for pop <dig> covering approximately 70% of the consensus map obtained in previous studies. theoretically, 99% coverage should be obtained by using a higher multiplex custom assay of  <dig>  snp. however, more pea genome sequence information would be needed in order to increase the number of snps available and hence enlarge the size of the assay.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate the suitability of the goldengate assay for high-throughput snp genotyping to characterise collections containing diverse germplasm or to rapidly establish genetic maps connected with pre-existing ones, and thus open new prospects for pisum genomics. the use of next-generation sequencing technologies associated with techniques enabling to target specific regions  <cit>  should allow sequencing of large regions of the pea genome followed by re-sequencing of these regions in different genotypes. this strategy should reveal thousands of snps that can be genotyped and mapped in different populations. the genotyping quality  and map position data obtained for the different snps will help in the design of different panels utilisable for building consensus genetic maps, to study diversity, for positional cloning or in association mapping studies.
