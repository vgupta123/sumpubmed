BACKGROUND
the “s domain”  was initially defined by the s-locus glycoprotein  and the s-locus receptor kinase , which are encoded by two closely-linked genes in the brassica self-incompatibility  determining locus, the s locus. slg, which was the first s locus-derived gene identified, encodes a secreted glycoprotein, whereas srk encodes a transmembrane receptor kinase with an extracellular domain that shares extensive sequence similarity with slg  <cit> . srk is the female determinant of specificity in “self-pollen” recognition, and in self-incompatible species of the brassicaceae , the s haplotype-specific binding of srk to its cognate pollen-borne ligand s locus cystein rich protein/s locus protein  <dig>  activates the srk and triggers a signaling cascade that culminates in “self-pollen” rejection  <cit> . the extracellular s domain of srk is responsible for ligand binding  <cit> , whereas the intracellular kinase domain  is thought to translate this signal into a cellular response by phosphorylating arm repeat containing  protein, an e <dig> ligase involved in protein ubiquitination  <cit> . with the increasing availability of sequenced plant genomes, it has been realized that proteins having a structure resembling srks, designated s-domain receptor-like kinases , form one of the largest and most-rapidly expanding subfamilies within the plant receptor-like/pelle kinase superfamily  <cit> . in addition, a large group of receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases  resembling the intracellular kinase domains of srlks but lacking the extracellular s-domain  were also defined by their close phylogenetic relationship to the kinase domains of srlks  <cit> . interestingly, another class of proteins resembling slgs, designated s-domain receptor-like proteins, srlps, is also ubiquitous in plants  <cit> , suggesting that the composite srlks likely originated by fusion of the two split component proteins. phylogenetic analyses of the kinase domains in arabidopsis thaliana also suggested that srlks are not monophyletic and probably arose via independent recruitment of s domains  <cit> .

gene fusion is considered to be an important evolutionary path to create novelty in protein architectures  and functions by forming composite proteins and linking components of extant signaling/biochemical pathways  <cit> . in agreement with this notion, a number of chimeric genes generated by gene fusions have been reported to have important functions  <cit> . based on the assumption that selection favors fusions of functionally-related proteins, identification of fusion-link  has initially been used to predict genome-wide protein interactions and functions in the extremely compact genomes of prokaryotes and yeasts  <cit> , and more recently in the more complex eukaryotic genomes  <cit> . based on the distribution patterns of the composite proteins and the split proteins in either the species trees  <cit>  or the domain trees  <cit> , gene fusion events were inferred in a large number of sequenced genomes. furthermore, a maximum parsimony algorithm has been established to analyze the evolution of protein architectures, in particular domain fusion and fission, based on the inferred ancestral architecture at each node in the species trees  <cit>  or domain trees  <cit> . in plants, because only the arabidopsis and rice genomes have been included in such studies, very little is known about the evolution of domain architecture in other plant genomes. despite the fact that multiple-domain proteins in super-protein families are normally composed of abundant and versatile domains and tend to undergo more independent gene fusion/fission events  <cit> , analysis of gene fusion/fission events in a large gene subfamily such as srlk subfamily is still lacking.

as the only members of the srlk subfamily whose function is known, srks are well suited to investigate the functional diversification of srlks. in brassica species but not arabidopsis species, srks may be clearly divided into two classes, class i and class ii  <cit> . moreover, phylogenetic analyses of srk kinase domains showed that srks from brassica species are not monophyletic, having descended from only two of the lineages that were presumably present in the arabidopsis-brassica ancestor, and that diversification of the brassica s haplotypes took place after the separation of the two genera  <cit> . furthermore, theoretical analyses have long predicted that si could have been first expressed in a two s-haplotype system causing incomplete suppression of selfing, with further differentiation among s haplotypes and enhancement of si expression having evolved subsequently  <cit> . this long-held hypothesis awaits further elaboration by molecular evolution studies.

in this study, we first retrieved srlks from five sequenced genomes representing the major lineages of land plants. srlcks were then delineated by their close phylogenetic relationship to srlks based on a maximum likelihood  kinase domain tree. on the basis of a reconciled species-domain tree including both srlks and srlcks, gene duplication/loss and fusion events in srlk evolution were inferred and dated by integrating the maximum parsimony ancestral architecture inference algorithm  <cit>  into the widely applied gene duplication/loss model  <cit> . in addition, the origination of srks in the brassicaceae was explored by reconstruction of srk kinase domain phylogeny in the context of srlk evolution.

RESULTS
srlks emerged in early land plants and expanded greatly in angiosperms
srlks are composed principally of three modular domains in a configuration of s domain -transmembrane domain -kinase domain . sds are further divided into three subdomains in a configuration of b_lectin-slg-pan_apple . the b_lectin and pan_apple domains have been proposed to be important for protein structure and dimerization of brassica srks, while the hypervarible slg domain plays a key role in scr binding  <cit> . transmembrane domain  prediction is not always accurate, thus tm will not be considered in our protein architecture analyses. proteins with stand-alone slg and pan_apple domains are rare, whereas b_lectin domain proteins are more abundant, particularly in the spikemoss genome .

a total of  <dig> srlk and  <dig> srlp sequences with the domain architecture typical of srks  or slgs  were retrieved and are hereafter referred to as typical srlks and srlps respectively . other combinations of b_lectin, slg, pan_apple, and kd domains are also ubiquitous in different plant species . these combinations may represent either the precursors of typical srlks/srlps or the degenerated products of the typical srlks/srlps. our search also retrieved stand-alone b_lectin and pan_apple sequences in the genomes of green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii and ostreococcus tauri, whereas sequences of stand-alone slg domains or any combination of b_lectin, pan_apple, slg, and kd domains were not detected. in view of the fact that plant rlks were likely generated after the divergence of land plants from green algae  <cit> , we tentatively included sequences containing combinations of at least two of the four modular domains, adding  <dig> srlk and  <dig> srlp sequences with atypical domain architectures to our dataset. nine proteins with stand-alone slg, which characterize s-domains, were also included as srlps. in total, our dataset included  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> srlks and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> srlps from the genomes of physcomitrella patens , selaginella moellendorffii , oryza sativa , arabidopsis thaliana , and populus trichocarpa  respectively . in moss and spikemoss, a relatively small number srlks  are found, and srlks continued to expand immediately after the divergence of angiosperms, since there are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  times  as many members in rice, arabidopsis and poplar, respectively, compared with moss.

kinase domain tree and delineation of srlcks
to delineate srlcks by the kinase-domain tree, kd sequences from  <dig> srlks in our dataset and total  <dig> rlcks of the five species from phytozome v <dig>  that were the best hits to the members of the gene family hom <dig> in plaza  <dig>  database were then used to construct a maximum likelihood  phylogenetic tree . the basal nodes of the phylogenetic tree are composed of  <dig> rlcks, while two well-supported monophylectic groups  in land plants are evident. the first group consists of  <dig> srlks, while the second group consists all  <dig> rlcks as well as  <dig> moss srlks. therefore, the  <dig> rlcks are hereafter designated as srlcks . considering protein architectures, srlks are not monophylectic but form two groups, the major group containing  <dig> srlks and the minor group containing  <dig> moss srlks. in the major group, two large subgroups correspond to the previously-identified sd- <dig> and sd- <dig> s-domain rlks  <cit> , which are composed of  <dig> srlks, and  <dig> srlks, respectively.

sd- <dig> srlks are specific for angiosperms, indicating that this group is approximately  <dig> million years old  <cit> . in contrast to sd- <dig>  sd- <dig> is a very diverse group of srlks from all species with well-dissolved clades. given that the oldest evidence for the existence of vascular plants is found in upper ordovician, sd- <dig> srlks are inferred to be more than  <dig> million years old . based principally on the topology of the trees, clade support values and branch length, we tentatively defined  <dig>  and  <dig> subgroups in each of the sd- <dig> and sd- <dig> groups. interestingly, the a. thaliana srk falls in the sd-1b subgroup, sharing a most recent common ancestor with  <dig> arabidopsis,  <dig> rice, and  <dig> poplar srlks . more importantly, except for the two moss srlks, all srlks or srlcks cluster together, which strongly suggests that extant srlks are likely derived from one major s-domain recruitment event in land plant evolution.

inference and dating of gene duplication/loss and fusion/fission events in the evolutionary history of srlks
the gene duplication-loss model embedded in notung has been used to infer and date gene duplication/loss events in rlk evolution  <cit> . after a reconciled species-domain tree was generated by notung, we inferred the ancestral architectures of all nodes along the reconciled tree according to our model . gene duplication/loss and fusion/fission events were inferred and dated. srlks were shown to have a rapid gene expansion, whereas srlcks tended to have undergone a decay comparing with the inferred number of ancestors in early land plants . a leap of common ancestor number from  <dig> in the ancestor of land plants to  <dig> of angiosperms represents a critical stage in srlk expansion, which coincides with the emergence of angiosperms and the rapid increase in gene duplication events. in the past  <dig> million years after the divergence of moss and the embryophyta ancestor, two duplications of srlks was inferred, while as many as  <dig> duplications were inferred to have occurred in the past  <dig> million years after the divergence of poplar and its rosid ancestor. in arabidopsis, the results suggest rapid birth and death of srlks, and the loss of most srlcks .

based on the distribution patterns of srlks and srlcks in the reconciled tree, gene fusion/fission events in the evolutionary history of srlks were also inferred . in total,  <dig> gene fusion events were inferred, while no fission event was detected. the major ancient gene fusion event occurred in the common ancestor of land plants and generated the ancestral gene of  <dig> extant srlks. the other minor gene fusion event occurred after moss have diverged from the common ancestor of land plants, generating two extant moss srlks. notably, scarcity of gene fusion and the lack of fission events in the evolution of srlks subfamily suggests that functional diversification of srlks is principally driven by sub-or neo-funtionalization of duplicated genes.

origination of brassicaceae srks in the context of srlk evolution
the a. thaliana srk falls within the sd-1b group, a small monophyletic group in angiosperms that includes  <dig> non-srk members, which are good candidates to investigate the functional diversification of srlks . we thus performed phylogenetic analysis of srks by including kd sequences of  <dig> srks from the brassica/raphanus and arabidopsis/capsella lineages as well as sd-1b members . a functional srk from self-fertile a. thaliana accession wei was included to replace the Ψsrk , because its function in si has been demonstrated  <cit> . in addition, a likely functional srk sequence  from the newly-evolved self-fertile species capsella rubella is also included  <cit> .

the topology of our rooted ml kinase domain tree is similar to that of an unrooted ml kinase domain tree based on nucleotide sequences  <cit> . three separate well-supported clades, brassica class i, arabidopsis/capsella, and brassica class ii, are evident . the a. thalina non-srk srlks, arabidopsis receptor kinase , do not fall within the outgroups in the kinase domain tree , but form a well-supported orthologous group in the brassicaceae with brassica class-ii srks. in contrast, they do fall within outgroups in s-domain trees in our  and other studies  <cit> . a. thaliana srk  and most srks from a. lyrata, a. halleri, and capsella grandiflora also form a distinct orthologous group in the arabidopsis/capsella lineage. in addition, brassica class-i srks and arabidopsis/capsella srks  appear to form a large orthologous group in brassicaceae, albeit with a relatively low bootstrap value . a. thaliana srk  and ark <dig>  are located in different orthologous groups and are arranged in tandem . the same arrangement of srk and ark <dig> orthologs was also retained in all characterized s haplotypes of a. lyrata .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the architecture of the srlks was likely established after the divergence of land plants from green algae approximately  <dig> million years ago, but before the divergence of vascular plant lineage from the moss lineage. consistent with their predicted function in perceiving various external signals, the sds of srlks are very variable in both sequence and architecture. because of the highly variable nature of the sds and the resulting poor sequence alignments, it was difficult to use these domains for investigating the trajectory of srlk evolution. in contrast, kinase-domain sequences are more conservative likely due to constrains imposed by the requisite interactions with other signaling partners, and were thus used in our study to simplify the interpretation of srlk evolution.

by integrating the ancestral architecture inference algorism  <cit>  into the widely applied gene duplication-loss parsimony model  <cit> , we established a maximum parsimony model suitable to infer and date gene duplication/loss and fusion/fission events in srlk evolution . our results suggest that almost all  srlks of land plants are derived from a single ancient domain fusion event. continuous expansion of srlks by gene duplication has played pivotal roles in shaping the phylogenies of extant srlks. in contrast with previous interpretations based merely on topology of the phylogenetic trees  <cit> , we show that sd- <dig> and sd- <dig> group srlks were generated by the same ancient gene-fusion event that likely occurred in the common ancestor of land plants. mis-annotation of genomic sequences, however, may be accounted for the inconsistence between our results and the published papers  <cit> . when the poplar genome of phytozome v <dig> , in which only 10% annotated gene models are supported by full length cdnas, were used for detecting fusion/fission events, we could detect  <dig> fusion events and  <dig> fission events occurred in poplar. however, no fusion or fission event was found using the updated poplar genome of phytozome v <dig> , in which  <dig> out of  <dig> srlks/rlcks were supported by assembly ests . as in all other such studies, we assigned an equal cost for gene fusion, fission, duplication, loss, or speciation in order to avoid prior bias stemming from uncertainties relating to the relative frequency of these events  <cit>  and their dependence on the particular genomes investigated  <cit> . since the distribution patterns of the composite srlks and the split srlcks on the reconciled tree are critical for our analysis, expansion and high-rate retention of both the composite srlk and split srlck genes is essential. we might have underestimated the actual number of gene fusion/fission events in our analyses because the domain architectures  of the most recent common ancestors  at the leaf nodes with lost genes can only be inferred by the parsimony principle . similar requirements can be largely fulfilled in most rlk subfamilies such as lysin motif-type rlks  <cit> . we thus propose that our method could be extrapolated to analyze gene fusion/fission events in other multiple-domain super-protein families.

functional diversification following the origination of multiple-domain proteins is a common theme in studies of protein family evolution  <cit> . although great efforts have been devoted to investigate the diversification of srks by reconstructing their phylogeny, such studies are limited by the lack of suitable outgroups  <cit> . utilizing sd-1b members as outgroups, we show that in the brassicaeae, srks do not form a monophyletic clade. more intriguingly, ark1/ark2/ark <dig> are confidently clustered with brassica class-ii srks, forming a distinct orthologous group in the brassicaceae . this orthologous relationship between ark1/ark2/ark <dig> and class-ii srks has not been previously revealed because s-domain trees were used in most studies  <cit> . even in studies that used the kinase-domain trees, neither ark1/ark2/ark <dig>  <cit>  nor brassica srks were included  <cit> . furthermore, a. thaliana srk confidently clustered with most srks of arabidopsis/capsella species, forming another distinct orthologous group in the arabidposis/capsella lineage . since srk and ark <dig> are arranged in tandem in the s haplotypes of arabidopsis species, we propose the following model on the origins of srks. an ancient duplication in the common ancestor of brassicaceae produced two tandemly-arranged paralogous genes, designated as ancestor of srki  and ancestor of srkii . subsequently, random neo-fuctionalzation and/or sub-funtionalization of a_srki and a_srkii produced two ancient s haplotypes, from which srks might have been derived by further diversification . this model provides a mechanism for the establishment of the long-proposed ancient two-s haplotype si system in the common ancestor of the brassicaceae  <cit> . however, the clustering of arabidopsis/capsella srks with brassica/raphanus class-i srks in the same orthologous group remains ambiguous because of the relatively low support value. the different gene orders of slgs and srks in known class-i and class-ii s haplotypes  and the inference that slgs were derived from an ancient duplicated copy of srk  <cit> , support the notion that class-i and class-ii srks might also be derived from two tandemly duplicated paralogous genes. similar examples of the evolution of functional orthologous genes from ancient paralogs have been reported for agamous and plena <cit>  as well as srnases in diploid strawberry  <cit> . paralogs produced by tandem duplications such as a_srki and a_srkii might be prone to this random evolution, because they are free from constrains of different genomic contexts. regulatory neo-functionalization is the most likely evolutionary scenario for paralogs produced by tandem duplications  <cit> . however, no overlap in the expression domains of ark <dig> and srka in self-incompatible a. lyrata has been observed in either vegetative or floral tissues , suggesting that regulatory sub-functionalization played a significant role in srk evolution. nevertheless, certain srk variants are expressed in leaf tissue  <cit> , indicating that regulatory neo-functionalization also played a role. together with the fact that arabidopsis ark <dig> is orthologous to brassica class-ii srks, our findings indicate that the biochemical functions of srks and ark <dig>  and probably other srlks in the sd-1b group, are likely the same or very similar. this conclusion is in line with the existence of a conserved duf  <dig> motif between sds and kds in ark <dig>  ark <dig>  ark <dig>  and all srks, and particularly with the findings that ark <dig>  ark <dig>  and ark <dig> interact with and phosphorylate a number of the arabidopsis plant u-box/arm-repeat , arc <dig> homologs of a. thaliana <cit> . in view of that arks and other srlks may be involved in plant innate immunity responses  <cit> , the overlap of srk signaling with that of plant immunity mediated by ark <dig> and other sd-1b group srlks suggested by our molecular evolution study is intriguing and should be pursued by further experimental investigations.
