BACKGROUND
compared with animal mitochondrial genomes that are compact and relatively uniform in size, plant mitochondrial genomes are extremely complex and have characteristic features, including large genome size, frequent reorganization and incorporation of foreign dna  <cit> . plant mitochondrial genome varies in size from 208 kb in brassica hirta to  <dig>  mb in silene conica <cit> , due to the expansion of non-coding sequence and duplication of a large segment. it is also well known that plant mitochondrial genome evolves rapidly in structure and slowly in sequence. plant mitochondria contain a number of repeats. the recombination via repeat sequences is believed to be responsible for extensive structural change. incorporation of foreign dna fragments that originated from plastid and nuclear genomes also can be found in plant mitochondrial genome. because of frequent recombination and incorporation of foreign dna, extensive genome reorganization and gene-order shuffling may occur. these changes in mitochondrial genome can produce novel open reading frames, some of which result in cytoplasmic male sterility   <cit> .

cms is a maternally inherited trait in which a plant is unable to produce functional pollen. cms is an economically important trait for f <dig> hybrid seed production in many crops. cms has been widely observed in higher plants, and many reports show that cms is caused by alteration of the mitochondrial genome  <cit> . these alterations often create a novel open reading frame , which consists of a chimeric sequence generated by gene shuffling or by fusion between a native gene and/or an unknown sequence.

the ogura male-sterile cytoplasm, which was originally found in an unknown variety of japanese radish, is the most widely studied cytoplasm in brassicaceae <cit> . this cytoplasm is used in f <dig> seed production of european, chinese and japanese radishes. the cytoplasm was introduced into brassica crops by intergeneric hybridization and somatic cell fusion, and has been utilized for f <dig> seed production in brassica crops such as rapeseed worldwide  <cit> .

a mitochondrial gene, orf <dig>  is responsible for ogura male sterility and specifically present in the mitochondrial genome of various radishes with ogura-type cytoplasm  <cit> . the accumulation of orf <dig> protein is observed in plants expressing the cms phenotype, and the association of orf <dig> with the inner mitochondrial membrane of male-sterile plants was reported  <cit> . although it appeared that expression of the nuclear chalcone synthase gene, which is related to flavonoid biosynthesis, is inhibited in the anther of ogura radish  <cit> , the molecular mechanism underlying ogura cms by orf <dig> protein is not known. the sequence of the gene orf <dig> itself is also interesting; there is no evidence that orf <dig> is a chimeric gene consisting of native mitochondrial genes or sequence. no sequence homologous to orf <dig> is found in public databases; therefore, the origin of orf <dig> is a mystery. in addition, it has been shown that the mitochondrial genome of ogura-type cytoplasm is highly rearranged compared with that of normal cytoplasm in radish. these rearrangements occurred in the loci atp1atp6cox <dig> and most notably orf138-atp <dig> <cit> . the gene orf <dig> is specifically located in the 5’ upstream region of the gene atp <dig> in ogura radish, whereas the region is occupied by the gene cox <dig> in normal radish  <cit> . in the evolution of raphanus, how and when these extensive rearrangements occurred between two types of mitochondrial genome are not known.

in this study, in order to obtain a better understanding of the origin of orf <dig> and ogura-type mitochondrial genome in radish, we determined the complete nucleotide sequences of two mitochondrial genomes of radish, that is, ogura- and normal-type mitochondrial genomes, and compared their structures. gene contents and unique regions for each genome were analyzed in detail at the sequence level. furthermore, we focused on short repeated sequences that may be involved in the recombination, leading to extensive rearrangements of the two genomes and to generation of the gene orf <dig> 

RESULTS
radish mitochondrial genome
the ogura and normal mitochondrial genomes are assembled as  <dig> -bp and  <dig> -bp circular molecules, respectively . the overall gc content of both mtdnas is  <dig> %, being comparable to those of other mtdnas of brassicaceae. about 7% of ogura and 3% of normal sequences are unique to each mitochondrial genome, and 80% of ogura and 84% of normal sequences show high similarity to the sequence of rapeseed  mitochondrial genome   <cit> .

gene organization of radish mitochondrial genome
normal-type mitochondrial genome contained  <dig> protein-coding and three rrna genes, while ogura-type genomes contained same genes and one additional atp <dig> . gene content is identically conserved between the two radish mitochondrial genomes and it is also identical to that of rapeseed, except atp9- <dig> in ogura-type genome. normal-type genome contains similar sequence to atp9- <dig>  but 3’ part of this sequence lacks similarity to atp9- <dig>  the atp9- <dig> like sequence in normal-type genome encodes  <dig> amino acid protein, which is lacking atp <dig> domain partially. eighteen of the conserved  <dig> protein-coding genes produce components of the electron transport chain and atp synthase: nine subunits of complex i, apocytochrome b  of complex iii, three subunits of complex iv  and five subunits of complex v . five additional proteins are involved in the biogenesis of cytochrome c . another eight genes encode ribosomal proteins . the two remaining genes encode maturase  and orfx. the gene ccmfn is divided into two reading frames in mitochondrial genomes of radish like in those of rapeseed and arabidopsis <cit> . three rrna genes  are highly conserved between the two mitochondrial genomes of radish.

the 5’ region of the gene atp <dig> is highly diverged between the two radishes because of recombination that occurred in the locus  <cit> . the 3’ end of ogura-type orfx also lacks similarity to that of normal-type. this is caused by a 48-bp repeated sequence that is regarded as a minisatellite. eleven snps were identified in the nine genes: four were synonymous and seven were non-synonymous . as for trna, both ogura and normal mitochondrial genomes contain  <dig> trnas, whereas ogura genome has an additional trnfm . the trnfm- <dig>  which is located close to the gene orf <dig> , has a specific snp compared with other sequenced mitochondrial trnfms in brassicaceae.

we searched for a sequence homologous to the orf <dig> in ogura and normal mtdna sequences. only a 67-bp sequence, which includes the 3’ terminal of the orf <dig> sequence and its 3’ utr, was detected. this sequence is homologous to 5’ flanking region of ccmfn <dig> in reported brassicaceae genomes. however, except for this short sequence, no homology was found between the main part of the gene orf <dig> and other parts of the brassicaceae mitochondrial genome.

reorganization between two types of radish mitochondrial genome
the bl2seq analysis suggested that the radish mitochondrial genome consists of  <dig> syntenic regions  . the sequence in the ogura-type mitochondrial genome shows quite high homology  to that of normal mitochondrial genome within these syntenic regions. this analysis revealed that ogura-type mitochondrial genome has a large unique region  between syntenic regions  <dig> and  <dig>  this unique region corresponds to the “region a” that was reported by makaroff et al.  <cit> . the gene orf <dig> is located at one of the terminals of this region .

repeats in two mitochondrial genomes have been investigated. if a pair of sequences has over 90% similarity, the pair is defined as a repeat. a pair of large repeats of  <dig>  bp was found in ogura-type mitochondrial genome, while a pair of large repeats of  <dig>  bp was identified in normal-type. even though the length of large repeats is different, sequence of the large repeats are highly conserved within  <dig>  bp. in ogura-type mitochondrial genome, the large repeats are located in syntenic regions  <dig> and 11/ <dig> . a  <dig> -bp sequence, corresponding to ogura-type repeat, is conserved in syntenic region 5/ <dig> of the normal-type genome, but it is truncated in syntenic region  <dig> because normal-type genome has a specific sequence between syntenic regions  <dig> and  <dig>  in rapeseed mitochondrial genome, a  <dig> -bp sequence that includes the gene cox <dig> was reported as a large direct repeat. large repeated sequences found in raphanus are completely different from those reported in rapeseed  <cit> . these large repeats are considered to be involved in the formation of a tripartite structure; each radish mitochondrial genome could recombine into two sub-genomic circles. two expected sub-genomic circles are  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp in ogura-type, while they are  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp in normal-type. in addition, these repeats are also related to reorganization among syntenic regions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .

we defined  <dig> and  <dig> short repeats in ogura- and normal-type genomes, respectively . these repeats can account for reorganization of mitochondrial genome via homologous recombination. we have identified repeats that can be involved in reorganization from normal- to ogura-type mitochondrial genomes, although the direction of changes cannot be fixed. the pair of inverted repeats  is located on either side of syntenic region  <dig> in normal-type genome. these inverted repeats may change the orientation of syntenic region  <dig> in ogura-type genome . in normal-type mitochondrial genome, a pair of direct repeats  is located at the edge of syntenic regions  <dig> and  <dig>  these repeats can be related to generation of a linkage between  <dig> and  <dig> in ogura-type genome . in normal-type genome, normal r <dig> is present at the edge of syntenic region  <dig> and in the unique sequence located between syntenic regions  <dig> and  <dig> in the inverted orientation. a 10-bp short repeat is also present in this unique sequence, and it exists at the edge of syntenic region  <dig> in the direct orientation. these repeats can be associated with the generation of a linkage between syntenic regions  <dig> and  <dig> in ogura-type genome . syntenic regions  <dig> and  <dig> in normal-type genome have a 21-bp short inverted repeat. this inverted repeat can be involved in inversion and recombination between syntenic regions  <dig> and  <dig> in ogura-type genome . finally, in normal-type genome, syntenic region  <dig> has normal r <dig> and a short 36-bp repeat at each edge. normal r <dig> is also present at one edge of syntenic region  <dig>  being overlapped with a 36-bp repeat. in ogura-type genome, a linkage between syntenic regions  <dig> and  <dig> is generated via these two sequences. this recombination event also changes the location of the gene atp <dig> . moreover, in ogura-type genome, two copies of a short direct repeat  are present at the edge of syntenic regions  <dig> and  <dig>  between which syntenic region  <dig> is inserted with a novel sequence .

open reading frames that are unique to each mitochondrial genome type
a comprehensive comparison of predicted orfs was conducted between ogura- and normal-type mitochondrial genomes. we picked up unique orfs that can encode over  <dig> amino acids and were generated by recombination. as a result, six orfs including orf <dig> were specifically detected in ogura-type mitochondrial genome . the five ogura-type orfs were located between syntenic regions  <dig> and  <dig>  whereas orf <dig> was in syntenic region  <dig>  with the exception of orf <dig>  the nucleotide sequences of the five orfs showed high similarity to the reported sequences in plant mitochondrial genomes of other species. as for the normal-type genome, three unique orfs were detected. the orf <dig> has strong similarity to the orf <dig> in ogura-type. the extension of orf <dig> was caused by a new initiation codon that was created in 5’ region of orf <dig> through a recombination between syntenic regions  <dig> and  <dig>  the two remaining orfs were located within the region unique to the normal-type genome located between syntenic regions  <dig> and  <dig>  protein blast analysis was conducted to characterize unique orfs. even though homologous amino acid sequences were not found for orf <dig> in normal-type and for orf <dig> and orf <dig> in ogura-type, other unique orfs encoded similar proteins that have been reported in the mitochondrial genome of rapeseed or arabidopsis.

regions unique to the ogura-type mitochondrial genome
ogura-type mitochondrial genome has four unique regions that are non-syntenic to normal-type mitochondrial genome. unique region i is  <dig>  bp, which is located between syntenic regions  <dig> and  <dig> . unique regions ii and iii are  <dig> -bp and 451-bp sequences that are present between syntenic regions  <dig> and  <dig>  and between syntenic regions  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the largest unique region iv is located between syntenic regions  <dig> and  <dig> . total length of the unique regions in ogura-type genome is  <dig>  bp, which occupies 7% of the whole ogura-type mitochondrial genome. the largest unique region contains five unique orfs including orf <dig> 

to obtain more information on the sequence unique to ogura-type genome, nucleotide blast search was conducted to assign the sequences. the search showed that over 80% of these regions consist of sequences homologous to those reported for brassicaceae or radish mitochondrial genomes. bl2seq analyses were further conducted between the sequence unique to ogura-type and each of five mitochondrial genomes in brassicaceae . seventy-two percent of unique region i  and 100% of unique region ii  were occupied by five mitochondrial sequences of brassicaceae . as for the smallest unique region iii, 97% of the sequence  was shown to have similarity to rapeseed mtdnas. as for the largest unique region iv, sequences homologous to the five brassicaceae mitochondrial genomes covered 80% of this region , even though orf <dig> sequence itself had no similarity. homologous sequences detected by bl2seq were plotted on unique region iv in ogura-type mitochondrial genome . homologous sequences were scattered throughout this region. insertion of plastid or nuclear sequence has not been detected in this region. it seems, therefore, that the region unique to ogura-type mitochondrial genome was created by frequent recombination and shuffling of mitochondrial dna sequences during the evolution of brassicaceae.

discussion
comparative sequence analysis of ogura- and normal-type mitochondrial genomes
ogura-type mitochondrial genome was 14 kb larger than that of normal type. region iv that is unique to ogura-type mitochondrial genome mainly contributes to this size difference. comparative analysis has been performed between mitochondrial genomes of cms and normal lines in other higher plant species. in sugar beet, owen-type cms line has a significantly larger mitochondrial genome than fertile line because the owen-type mitochondrial genome contains one 86-kb large repeat  <cit> . in wheat, the mitochondrial genome of the cms line ks <dig> was reported to be 192 kb larger than that of common wheat  <cit> . this difference is also caused by additional large repeats, including a 98-kb repeat. in contrast, a rice  ld-cms line has a smaller mitochondrial genome than fertile line, while cw-cms derived from wild rice  has a larger genome than fertile line  <cit> . the difference in mitochondrial genome size within the oryza genus is also attributable to large repeats. it should be noted that the size difference between two radish mitochondrial genomes mainly arises from a novel sequence of  <dig>  bp, not from a large repeated sequence.

the reported brassicaceae species including brassica and arabidopsis have small mitochondrial genomes among higher plants  <cit> . it is also known that brassicaceae mitochondrial genomes reported so far do not contain much nuclear sequence. the number of large repeats  is less in reported brassicaceae  than in other plants species  <cit> . while mitochondrial genomes of rice or wheat have more than ten large repeats, brassica and raphanus have only two large repeats. in addition, sequences derived from nuclear or plastid genomes were rarely observed. this is one of the reasons why mitochondrial genomes of brassica and raphanus are small. because of the small genome size and few large repeats, we can consider brassica and raphanus as species that have the “simple” mitochondrial genomes in higher plants. an understanding of the remarkable reorganization events that occurred in the simple radish genome will provide us with a clear picture of mitochondrial genome evolution, such as insertion of a 15-kb large novel sequence in ogura-type.

as expected, gene contents and their sequences were highly conserved between the two mitochondrial genomes in radish. the 5’ sequence of the atp <dig> in ogura-type mitochondrial genome is, however, different from that of normal-type. recombination had occurred at the site of syntenic region  <dig> and atp <dig>  which produced a new initiation codon for atp <dig> in ogura-type genome. according to the genome sequence, ogura-type atp <dig> encodes a different polypeptide from that of normal-type atp <dig>  however, the n-terminal of atp <dig> polypeptide of ogura-type is processed to produce a protein identical to normal-type atp <dig>  <cit> . the 3’ end of orfx also lacks similarity to the sequence of normal-type. this is caused by a 48-bp repeated sequence regarded as a minisatellite. this minisatellite will be a useful marker to detect polymorphism among radish mitochondrial genomes including ogura and normal types  <cit> . a total of  <dig> snps were detected in nine protein-coding genes between ogura and normal types. the number of snps in radish was similar to that in sugar beet; the sugar beet owen-cms line contains  <dig> snps in  <dig> protein-coding genes compared with the fertile lines  <cit> . as for trna,  <dig> trnas were highly conserved between two radish mitochondrial genome types, but ogura-type contains one additional trnfm . this additional trnfm- <dig> is located near orf <dig>  and it is interesting to note that this trnfm- <dig> has a unique snp that has not been found in other reported trnfms in brassicaceae. as for unique orfs, ogura-type has six unique orfs including orf <dig>  these orfs can be related to unique biological characteristics in ogura-type cytoplasm. in particular, transcription of four orfs  that are specific to ogura-type genome should be investigated in future study.

the origin of ogura-type unique sequence
cms-related orfs have been isolated in various plant species, such as t-urf <dig> in maize  <cit> , orf <dig> in sunflower  <cit> , pcf in petunia  <cit> , orf <dig> in pepper  <cit> , orf <dig> in sorghum  <cit>  and orf <dig> in rice  <cit> . in brassicaceae crops, in addition to orf <dig> in radish, three cms-related orfs have been reported: orf <dig> and orf <dig> in rapeseed  <cit> , and orf <dig> in brassica tournefortii <cit> . with the exception of orf <dig>  all these cms-related orfs have a chimeric structure that contains the sequence of known mitochondrial genes. the orf <dig>  however, does not contain any conserved mitochondrial sequence. the sequence of orf <dig> is totally novel, and is not present in normal-type mitochondrial genome of radish. it is quite interesting to reveal how the orf <dig> sequence was created during the evolution of radish mitochondrial genome. however, it now appears difficult to infer the origin of the gene orf <dig>  since no sequence homologous to the main part of orf <dig> is present in either ogura- or normal-type mitochondrial genome.

in this study, we have determined the nucleotide sequence for unique region iv  in ogura-type mitochondrial genome. the gene orf <dig> is located in this region. blast analysis using the sequence in region iv as a query showed that 80% of this region has similarity to the mitochondrial sequences in other brassicaceae plants, including rapeseed and arabidopsis. the analysis also showed that the homologous sequences are scattered throughout unique region iv . therefore, region iv is a mosaic of mitochondrial sequences from brassicaceae, suggesting that the sequence was generated through shuffling and fusion of pre-existing mitochondrial sequences in ancestral brassicaceae. the sequence of which the gene orf <dig> consists may be one of the products of this shuffling process. it is unlikely that the sequence of orf <dig> is derived from foreign dna, such as a nuclear or plastid sequence, because no sequence with clear homology to foreign dna is found within this unique region. however the possibility remains that they may be derived from horizontal gene transfer from unidentified organism.

this composition of novel sequence in radish contrasts to that reported for sugar beet. in sugar beet mitochondrial genome,  <dig> % of the unique regions showed significant homology to previously determined mitochondrial sequences,  <dig> % to nuclear dna,  <dig> % to mitochondrial episome and  <dig> % to plastid dna  <cit> .

the emergence of ogura-type cytoplasm
the sequence of ogura-type unique region iv can be derived from a mixture of sequences in the reported brassicaceae mitochondrial genome. the next question relates to how this unique region iv was generated or integrated into the radish mitochondrial genome. we searched for repeated sequences around this region. ogura-type unique region iv was shown to be sandwiched between syntenic regions  <dig> and  <dig> . there were identical 176-bp inverted repeats at the edges of regions  <dig> and  <dig>  on the insides of these repeated sequences, another pair of 28-bp repeated sequences was found in inverted orientation. these 28-bp sequences are specific to the ogura-type mitochondrial genome, and not found in normal-type genome. this characteristic arrangement of repeats indicates that unique region iv was integrated into the radish mitochondrial genome when recombination between syntenic regions  <dig> and  <dig> occurred.

previously, we conducted sequence analysis on the atp <dig> locus in normal- and ogura-type cytoplasm from wild and cultivated radishes  <cit> . while plants with normal-type cytoplasm contained several types of sequence, plants with ogura-type cytoplasm had only one type of sequence. these results suggested that a mutational event, which created linkage of atp <dig> and orf <dig>  occurred only once in the history of radish  <cit> . the present data indicate that this event probably occurred at the same time as when recombination between syntenic regions  <dig> and  <dig> occurred via 176-bp repeats and the unique region iv was integrated into the ogura-type mitochondrial genome . interestingly, the radish mitochondrial genome may have lost one putative promoter region for atp <dig> by this recombination . in arabidopsis, the promoters of mitochondrial genes have been determined  <cit> . a promoter sequence of atp <dig>  is almost conserved at the edge of syntenic region  <dig> of normal radish. the position of the promoter exactly matched the size of atp <dig> transcript   <cit> . the recombination of syntenic regions  <dig> and  <dig> would destroy the promoter sequence. therefore, recombination between syntenic regions  <dig> and  <dig> in normal radish can lead to loss of biological function in mitochondria. a reasonable hypothesis to explain the generation of ogura-type mitochondrial genome is that the mitochondrial genome rearrangement that could compensate for the loss of biological function had been selected among many rearranged genomes. integration of unique region iv can provide a new promoter for the gene atp <dig>  actually, in ogura-type genome, atp <dig> is co-transcribed with orf <dig> and trnfm, while in normal-type, atp <dig> is transcribed from its own promoter.

another possibility to explain the emergence of ogura-type mitochondrial genome is substoichiometric shift . sss is a phenomenon by which copy number of the substoichiometric molecule dramatically increases over generations  <cit> . research in some plants has shown that sss is related to the occurrence of cms  <cit> . recently, it has been reported that two mitochondrial genome types, pol -type and nap-type, co-exist among many rapeseed cultivars, and sss can explain the emergence of these cms  <cit> . in radish with normal-type cytoplasm, orf <dig> was reported to be present in substoichiometric molecules with low copy number by genomic pcr  <cit> . however, our previous analyses failed to detect the gene orf <dig> in various normal radishes. the fact that no sequence homologous to orf <dig> was found in the current pyrosequencing data  from a normal radish suggests that substoichiometric molecules containing orf <dig> are absent in normal radish. the discrepancy between our results and a previous study  <cit>  can be attributed to the differences of materials used and to the conditions of pcr including primers, type of dna polymerase and particularly amplification cycles . however, our pcr conditions can amplify two different configurations of orf <dig> regarded as subliminal fragments in various radishes with ogura-type cytoplasm. this indicates that, if there were orf <dig> sequences in normal radish, they would be at quite a low level, and the contribution of sss as a possible mechanism to explain generation of the ogura-type mitochondrial genome from normal-type genome remains to be elucidated.

previously, we conducted a large-scale sequence analysis of orf <dig> in  <dig> japanese wild radishes,  <dig> cultivated radishes and seven r. raphanistrum <cit> . on the basis of the pattern of mutation and the distribution of orf <dig> variants, we inferred the mechanism behind the differentiation of ogura-type cytoplasm. these studies showed that the original ogura-type radish is derived from japanese wild radish and that orf <dig> sequence of japanese wild radish was introduced from r. raphanistrum <cit> . however, it was still unclear when ogura-type cytoplasm was initially generated. this is still an open question, and comparative sequence analysis among more mitochondrial genomes in raphanus and molecular evolutionary studies of the data should provide clues to resolve this issue.

CONCLUSIONS
the complete nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial genome from ogura male-sterile radish reveals that the genome has been highly rearranged compared with that of normal radish. the radish mitochondrial genome consists of  <dig> syntenic regions. the reorganization of the genome occurred via a pair of large repeats and multiple pairs of short repeats, and produced four regions unique to the ogura-type mitochondrial genome. most of these unique regions consist of sequences homologous to known brassicaceae mitochondrial genomes. insertions of sequences derived from plastid or nuclear genome were not identified. this suggested that the unique regions were generated by integration and shuffling of pre-existing mitochondrial sequences during the evolution of brassicaceae, and novel genes such as orf <dig> could have been created by the shuffling process.
