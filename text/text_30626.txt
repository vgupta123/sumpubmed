BACKGROUND
since the discovery that small rna effectors define a number of developmental transitions and biological defence mechanisms  <cit> , sequencing efforts in a variety of organisms have led to the recognition of several distinct small rna sub-classes. these small rnas  function by guiding sequence-specific gene silencing at the transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional level and have been shown to play important regulatory roles in diverse biological processes  <cit> . among the small rna classes, microrna  is the most abundant class in mammals. over the past  <dig> years, more than  <dig> different mirna genes have been identified in animals and plants , and the number is expected to continue growing.

mirna genes were first discovered by forward genetic methods. these methods led to the identification of several mirna genes associated with developmental phenotypes in caenorhabditis elegans   <cit>  and programmed cell death in drosophila melanogaster   <cit> . forward genetics approaches are relatively inefficient for mirna gene discovery, in part because of a small mutagenic target size and in part due to functional redundancy. the development of large-scale rna sequencing methods  <cit>  has greatly facilitated mirna discovery, with thousands of mirnas now identified from various cell lines and tissues from a variety of organisms. apart from serving as a tool for novel small rna discovery, the small rna sequencing approach offers the potential to quantify and detect variation in mature mirnas, including rna editing  <cit>  and 5'/3'-end variations  <cit> . recent developments in ultra-high throughput sequencing technology greatly augment this approach, providing the possibility of a near-complete view of mirna profiles.

small rna profiling by deep sequencing has been applied in an increasing variety of biological situations . while greatly expanding the possibilities for precise expression profiling, sequencing-based profiling methods also raise new quantitative issues in recognizing and representing variation and significance in the resulting data sets. many parallel questions were addressed in the early days of microarray analysis. although sequence count data is analogous in some ways to microarray data, the two data types differ in numerous ways. first, microarray data provides an analogue measure of sequence prevalence while sequencing is inherently digital. second, microarray analyses generally operate above a low background level of non-specific and off-target probe-array binding that can complicate the analysis of low-abundance molecular species . with large enough sample sets, sequence-based analysis can avoid these background problems, allowing exquisite sensitivity. still, rare molecular species are certainly subject to stochastic fluctuations in sequence data sets and these fluctuations can be large components of the total signal in cases where the counts of individual species are small. microarray and sequence-counting based approaches share certain challenges, including biological and non-biological contamination and sample quality and reliability. finally, it should be pointed out that microarray and sequencing procedures each give relative  measures of sequence abundance. thus, the most informative comparisons look at changes in an expression ratio  between two samples. this makes absolute comparisons of rna abundance for different sequences problematic. comparisons of relative rna levels avoid such challenges and have been the focus of many analytical processes in both areas. in this work, we generate and analyse a large dataset of small rna sequences in cervical cancer/normal sample pairs. we show that this approach provides an extensive coverage of mirnas expressed in human cervical cancer tissues and normal cervices, including the detection of many previously known human mirnas and their respective mirna* sequences, as well as the identification of a number of novel mirnas. based on this sequence data we describe a statistical approach for cancer classification and we propose a new method for the identification of diagnostic mirnas using sequencing-based mirna profiling data. this approach should have general utility in analysing differential sequence representation between biological sample sets.

RESULTS
mirna profiling by small rna cdna library sequencing
we captured, amplified and sequenced  <dig> small rna libraries prepared from  <dig> pairs of cervical cancer tissues and matched normal tissues . in addition, the capture, amplification and sequencing for two small rna libraries  were repeated in order to determine the reproducibility of the results. a total of  <dig> , <dig> independent small rna sequences  were obtained . the average library coverage was  <dig>  sequences  with the sequenced population containing  <dig> %  mirna sequences representing  <dig> distinct mature mirnas . of these,  <dig> mirna genes produced sequencing reads corresponding to both arms of the mirna precursors. as expected, a majority of mirna genes displayed strand bias. the relative abundance of most of the star forms  was lower than that of their corresponding mirnas. however, six mirnas  had a higher number of sequencing reads originating from the annotated mirna* strand than the mature mirna sequence across majority of the libraries . some mirna genes demonstrated a nearly equal number of sequencing reads originating from the 5' and 3' arms of the mirna precursor.

the sequence data reveal a very broad range of expression levels for known mirnas : ~6% of mirnas were detected at high sequence counts , 14% were in the intermediate range , and the remaining were at low sequence counts  .

novel mirna genes
to search for novel candidate mirnas, we used criteria as previously described  <cit> :  at least  <dig> consecutive bases  aligned to human genome without any gaps;  formation of a sufficiently low-energy  secondary fold-back hairpin structure with small internal bulge within the mirna region and  complete containment of the cdna sequence within one arm of a hairpin. the resulting set of hairpin-derived small rnas was further analysed to distinguish genuine mirna precursors from other rnas with similar structures.

sixty-four novel mirna genes  were identified from a total of  <dig>  novel sequence reads . twenty-three of these newly identified mirna candidates were represented both in 5' and 3' arms of the hairpin precursor, providing strong evidence for biogenesis from a hairpin precursor. two of the mirna candidates were classified as mirtrons   <cit> . a distinct characteristic of a mirtron is that the mirna precursor is directly adjacent to the splice sites. among the novel candidate mirnas, we identified eight putative antisense mirnas . seven of these are antisense to known mirna genes, while the eighth is antisense to a novel mirna identified in this study . all new mirnas  were observed more than once and detected in more than one library . although the majority of the newly identified mirnas was detected at low abundance , some were rather prominent . among these, mir- <dig> was the most abundant with > <dig>  sequencing reads detected.

forty-one of the new mirnas were located in introns, one in an exon, and five in the 5'/3' untranslated regions of known genes;  <dig> were found in the intergenic regions. notably, mir- <dig> is located adjacent to a vault rna, hvg- <dig> . vault rnas are a noncoding rna family as part of the vault ribonucleoprotein complex that has been suggested to be involved in multidrug resistance  <cit> . interestingly, this candidate was only detected in cervical cancer samples  .

mirna data analysis
sequencing-based mirna profiling does not provide absolute measurements of mirna expression, but rather the relative counts of different mirnas within each sample. as described in the previous section, mirna-seq data are typically characterized by variances in total counts for each sample. these, as well as sequence counts for individual mirnas, will be subject to large sampling noise. moreover, in contrast to microarray data, the mirna-seq data involve non-negative counts.

all statistical analyses were performed on the cube-rooted data, unless otherwise specified. the raw data had a very skewed distribution, with many large values.

the cube-root transformation reduced this skewness and gave the resultant data an approximate poisson distribution, which was important for our log-linear modelling. the standard approach for testing differential expression of genes measured on microarrays is to compute a t-statistic for each gene; a permutation distribution is then used to estimate false discovery rates. the use of a t-statistic is justified if the data are approximately normally distributed with equal variances, as is the case for microarray data after suitable transformations. however, since sequencing data involve non-negative counts, the assumption of normality is not appropriate. we instead develop a new method to identify differentially-expressed sequences based on a poisson log linear model.

in order to evaluate reproducibility between replicates, we prepared two additional  libraries for which small rna capture, amplification and sequencing were carried out independently  from the respective original samples. the two samples for which this was done were g699n and g761t. from the raw data, we saw correlations of  <dig>  between the two libraries from g699n and  <dig>  for the two libraries from g761t. for reference, the mean correlation between pairs of different normal tissue samples was  <dig> , with the mean correlation between pairs of samples from different tumours being  <dig> . the observed duplicates are by no means perfectly concordant between replicate samples; in addition, we noted that some non-replicate pairs show more correlation with each other than do the pairs of replicates.

in order to visualize the 714-dimensional vectors of mirna expression in a lower-dimensional subspace, we performed principal components analysis . the principal components are the linear combinations of the mirnas that have the largest variance and provide informative axes for projection of the data. the analysis revealed clear separation between tumour and normal samples, but not between tumour types .

in order to assess the difference between normal and tumour samples, we performed an unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the samples using complete linkage and correlation-based distance. hierarchical clustering groups the samples by their similarity, in a bottom-up fashion. as shown in figure 2a, the clustering analysis resulted in the identification of two major subgroups that show an almost perfect separation between normal and tumour samples. recently, berninger et al. also presented a method for defining distances between samples for mirna expression profiling based on small rna cloning data  <cit> . for comparison, we also performed clustering using the distance measure defined in berninger et al. and the results revealed two subgroups with good separation .

in order to classify samples based on mirna expression levels, we applied the nearest shrunken centroids  method  <cit> . this method classifies samples by computing an average mirna expression vector for each class; these average expression vectors are then shrunken towards the overall mirna expression mean across the classes in order to avoid over-fitting and to obtain a classifier that makes use of only a subset of the mirnas. cross-validation , a process in which samples are repeatedly split into training and test sets, was performed in order to select the optimal number of mirnas to use in the classifier and to assess its accuracy. applying nsc for:  normal versus tumour resulted in 4/ <dig> cv errors ;  normal versus adenocarcinoma  versus squamous cell carcinoma  resulted in 7/ <dig> cv errors ; and  adc versus scc resulted in 4/ <dig> cv errors . the two adenosquamous carcinoma  samples were excluded from analyses  and . the mirnas used in the three nsc classifiers are shown in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> 

in order to further explore the performance of nsc for normal versus tumour samples, we randomly split the samples into a training set of  <dig> samples and a test set of  <dig> samples. we trained nsc on the training set and tested on the test set; this was repeated  <dig> times. this resulted in an average of  <dig>  errors for normal versus tumour classification. the samples that were most frequently misclassified were g529n, g696t, g701t, g850n and g871t. not surprisingly, the samples are located near the boundary of the tumour and normal samples in the principal component analysis  plot .

in order to identify mirnas that are differentially expressed between tumour and normal tissue, we needed to address the fact that the data were characterized by a high variance in sequence counts between samples as well as between mirnas, and the fact that the data were discrete. for this purpose, we propose the use of a poisson log-linear model. in this model, the cube-rooted counts for each mirna for each sample are taken as poisson random variables and the logs of the means of these poisson variables are estimated using a linear model . we allow a separate term for each mirna  and for each sample . an additional term for each mirna quantifies the extent to which each mirna's counts differ between tumour and normal tissue. that is, we model  <dig> + xij ~ poisson, where x denotes the cube-rooted data matrix, iindexes the mirnas, j indexes the samples, and log = βi + γj + ρi. here, we are using indicator variable notation: 1a equals  <dig> if a is true and  <dig> otherwise. in order to test how well the model fits the data, we binned the observations based on their fitted mean value in the poisson model and estimated the mean and variance of the observations in each bin. as expected, under the poisson model, the mean and variance of the observations within each bin are approximately equal . in our model,  can be thought of as a score for the extent to which mirna i is differentially expressed between tumour and normal samples. here, the denominator se  indicates the standard error of ρi. in order to estimate the false discovery rates  for these scores, we randomly permuted tumour and normal sample labels and compared the observed  scores to the null distribution of these scores obtained by permutations. for comparisons, we also computed fdrs resulting from the log-linear model on raw data, t-statistics on raw data, and t-statistics on cube-rooted data. we found that our log-linear model on cube-rooted data resulted in extremely low fdrs . based on the permutation results, only ~ <dig> of the  <dig> mirnas with highest estimated absolute  are false positives. the mirnas with highest absolute  scores are shown in table  <dig>  . all computations were carried out using the r statistical package version  <dig> . <dig> 

† can be considered as a score for whether microrna i is differentially expressed between tumour and normal: a large positive value indicates higher expression in tumour than normal.

§ only micrornas with low fdr  are shown.

fdr = false discovery rate.

dependence of analysis on sequencing scale
variation in overall sequence depth for different samples will be present in any analysis of independent biological specimens due to differences in tissue makeup and abundance, with some additional variation due to technical aspects of library construction and sequencing. our discussions above make use of datasets with numbers of sequence reads for the different samples that range from tens-of-thousands to over a million . in order to characterize the effect of sequencing scale on the statistical results obtained, we generated resampled data sets with various numbers of mirnas. that is, for n =  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig>  we sampled with replacement n mirnas from each of the  <dig> samples. we fit an nsc classifier in order to distinguish between normal and tumour samples using the resampled data sets. regardless of the value of n in this range, around 4/ <dig> cross-validation errors resulted. this suggests that the extent of library coverage does not greatly affect the classifier. we also computed the number of mirnas found to be differentially-expressed at a given fdr threshold for each of the resampled data sets. the results can be seen in additional file  <dig>  as n increases, so does the number of mirnas . as n becomes quite large, the benefit of further increasing n in terms of new mirna identification becomes marginal.

these results indicate that conclusions can be drawn at a variety of experimental scales, with deeper library coverage resulting in more power for some statistical analyses but with biological factors  eventually exerting the major limitations on interpretation as sequencing depth increases.

analysis of clustered mirna expression
we defined a mirna cluster as a set of mirnas located  within a  <dig> kb region or  in close proximity , with the same orientation and not separated by a mirna in the opposite orientation. our data contained  <dig> mirna clusters consisting of  <dig> mirnas . in order to determine whether the clustered mirnas showed significant co-expression, we calculated the average correlation of mirna pairs within each cluster. as shown in additional file  <dig>  we observed that many clusters contain mirnas that have more correlated expression than one would expect due to chance. twenty-three mirna clusters show significantly correlated expression . of these, eight clusters are highly correlated . these include mir-200b~ <dig>  mir-34b~34c, mir-503~ <dig>  mir-29c~29b, mir-15b~ <dig>  mir-200c~ <dig>  mir-99b~125a and mir-25~106b clusters.

in order to determine whether any of the  <dig> clusters contain mirnas that are significantly associated with the cervical cancer versus normal class labels, we applied the log linear model and calculated the median scores for the expressed mirnas in each cluster. we found that  <dig> clusters contain expressed mirnas that are significantly associated with the disease . seventeen of the  <dig> clusters are associated with increased expression in cervical cancer and the remaining  <dig> clusters are associated with reduced expression in cancer. interestingly, the two clusters that are most associated with the cervical cancer versus normal class labels both belong to the mir- <dig> family.

assessment of mirna expression patterns
we compared the expression level of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in all cervical cancer samples and matched normal cervices used in this deep sequencing experiment with previously published northern blot results of the same materials  <cit> . as shown in additional file  <dig>  both mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> expression patterns obtained from the sequencing data correlate well with the northern data. modest differences, observed for a number of the samples, could be indicative of non-linearity in either assay; alternatively such differences may be due to rna cross-hybridization , uncertainty in loading controls  and to gel exposure artifacts .

discussion
in this work, we used high throughput sequencing approaches combined with statistical analysis in order to comprehensively characterize mirna expression profiles of  <dig> matched pairs of human cervical cancer and normal cervical samples. our results reveal a large number of mirnas detected in all libraries and provide quantitative measures for a broad range of mirna expression levels.

mir* and antisense mir sequences
one aspect of mirna diversity comes from the ability to produce two distinct mirnas  from a given hairpin precursor rna. in this case, the two rnas are distinct products of the same initial processing product , one located 5' and one 3' on this precursor. the standard nomenclature for mirnas assigns the asterisk to the less abundant of the two forms found in the first identifying study. in this work, we detected a large number of mir* sequences, as well as mature mirnas from both 5' and 3' arms of the hairpin precursor. for six mirnas, we detected a higher number of mir* sequence than the annotated mature mirna sequence in a majority of the libraries. this may indicate that both 5' and 3' arms of the pre-mirna can be expressed in specific tissues/cells and that they may have a functional relevance. consistent with such a dual role, reversals of abundance between mir and mir* have been observed in several recent mirna transcriptome analyses  <cit>  and mir/mir* strand selection have also been shown to be different among different argonaute complexes  <cit> . furthermore, okamura et al. recently demonstrated that some mirna* species can associate with the rna-induced silencing complex and have inhibitory function  <cit> . these findings suggest that there are additional levels of complexity in mirna processing which remain to be determined.

three recent studies demonstrate that sense and antisense mirnas can be generated by bidirectional transcription of the drosophila hox mirna locus mir-iab- <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, these sense and antisense mirnas are expressed in non-overlapping spatial domains and have different targets. this phenomenon is not restricted to the hox loci in flies. many more sense-antisense mirna pairs have also been identified in flies and mammals  <cit> . here, we provide further evidence for the existence of sense-antisense mirna pairs in human tissues. although these antisense mirnas are low in abundance , their low concentration does not rule out their possible biological relevance. further investigations are warranted in order to assess the biological significance of these sense-antisense mirna pairs for a complete understanding of the complexity of gene regulation by mirnas.

mirna complexity
given that our small rna libraries were prepared from a single tissue type , we unexpectedly found a large number of mirnas  in each library, with the number depending on the depth of sequencing. the data suggest that many mirnas may lack complete tissue specificity, instead show a continuum of expression variability in different tissues/cells and physiological/pathological states. alternatively, a small population of distinct cell types may be present in the samples used for the analysis and contribute to the low-level detection of large numbers of mirnas. data with cell lines, which have more homogenous cell populations, are of relevance to this issue. consistent with the hypothesis of extensive diversity in a single cell type, friedländer et al. recently detected a total of  <dig> known mirnas in a single hela sample  <cit> .

mirna expression in cervical cancer and matched controls
we used two statistical techniques to develop an understanding of the differences in mirna expression between normal and tumour cervical tissue.

first, we used nsc  <cit> , a method originally developed for microarray data analysis, to construct a classifier that performs cancer class prediction from sequencing-based mirna expression profiling. the method successfully classified the normal and tumour samples in approximately  <dig> of  <dig> test samples. second, in order to identify mirnas that are differentially expressed between tumour and normal tissue, we developed a simple log linear model for data from ultra-high throughput sequencing. this model is analogous to using a t-statistic to identify differentially expressed genes in the case of microarray data. unlike the t-statistic, it is appropriate in cases where the observations take on discrete values and where variation occurs between samples as well as between genes or mirnas. this model resulted in the identification of a set of mirnas that distinguish tumour from normal samples, with low fdrs . the model can potentially be applied to any kind of sequencing data that produce count data. software implementing this log linear model will be made freely available.

in agreement with our  <cit>  and other previous findings  <cit>  with smaller data sets, the expression of mir- <dig> was significantly lower in cervical tumours as compared to their matched normal controls. importantly, mir- <dig> has been shown to inhibit cell growth in hela cells  <cit> , supporting its critical role in cervical carcinogenesis. also, a suppressor role of mir- <dig> has also been implicated in different tumour types  <cit> .

among the most abundant mirnas in the cervical cancer tissues, mir- <dig> has the highest estimated  score in the log linear model. its increased expression has also been observed in a variety of carcinomas, including cervical cancer  <cit> , endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma  <cit> , ovarian cancer  <cit> , bladder cancer  <cit> , head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  <cit>  and non-small cell lung cancer  <cit> . very recently, yu et al. demonstrated that the lipid phosphatase ship <dig>  can serve as a target of mir- <dig> in scc cells  <cit> , with down-regulation of mir- <dig> in scc cells leading to a marked increase in apoptosis and cell death  <cit> . this will certainly provide an important lead in investigating roles for mir- <dig> in cervical cancer.

an additional mirna demonstrating strong regulation, mir- <dig> , was significantly more abundant in the cervical cancer tissues than in their normal counterparts. this mirna seems to be cervical tissue specific in that it had not been previously observed in other tissues or cell types  <cit> . mir- <dig> is located in the intron of tp <dig>  and maps to chromosome 3q27- <dig>  a region frequently amplified in cervical carcinomas  <cit> . it will be of interest to test for potential roles of mir- <dig> in cervical carcinogenesis and/or progression.

clustered mirna expression
an analysis of clustered mirna expression revealed strong positive correlations among the closely neighbouring mirnas, suggesting that these mirnas may be controlled by common regulatory factor. the data are in consistent with several previous findings  <cit> . interestingly, we found that the mir- <dig> family of mirnas  was highly co-expressed in cervical cancer. these mirnas are located at two different genomic loci: the mir-200b~ <dig> cluster is located on chromosome  <dig>  and the mir-200c~ <dig> cluster is located on chromosome  <dig>  the co-expression of these mir- <dig> loci suggests that these mirna clusters might be co-regulated by common regulator and function together. in line with such hypothesis, bracken et al. recently demonstrated that both mir-200b~ <dig> and mir-200c~ <dig> clusters are encoded by single polycistronic primary mirna transcripts  <cit> . furthermore, the e-cadherin transcriptional repressor zeb <dig> was found to directly suppress transcription of both clusters  <cit> . as the five mir- <dig> family members contain very similar seed sequences, these mirnas are likely to regulate some common targets. in support, several independent studies showed that two transcriptional repressors of e-cadherin, zeb <dig> and zeb <dig>  are the direct targets of the mir- <dig> family mirnas  <cit> . although the expression of mir- <dig> clusters is reduced in mesenchymal and invasive cells, its over-expression has also been observed in ovarian  <cit>  and cervical  <cit>  cancers.

a unique small rna downstream of the vault transcript
among the novel mirnas discovered here, mir- <dig> has the unique feature of sitting immediately downstream of vault rna, hvg- <dig> . vault rnas are small non-coding rnas produced by rna polymerase iii  <cit> . the possibility that mir- <dig> might be produced from the hvg- <dig> promoter suggests a type of dicistronic heterologous pol iii transcript similar to trna-mirna dicistronic transcripts that have been identified in the mouse gammaherpesvirus  <dig>  <cit>  and in the c19mc cluster of the human genome  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our approach illustrates the high value of ultra-high throughput sequencing data for novel mirna discovery and quantitative analysis of mirnas. the statistical approach described in this study is broadly applicable to the analysis of any rna sequencing data.
