BACKGROUND
molecular evolution refers to the evolutionary process at the macromolecular level, such as at the dna, rna, and protein levels. it encompasses the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of organisms and macromolecules  on the basis of the sequence data of nucleic acids and proteins. the primary event in molecular evolution is a mutational change in genes that may be caused by the substitution or insertion/deletion of a nucleotide, recombination, etc.; otherwise, in general, dna sequences are copied exactly during the process of chromosome replication. subsequently, they spread in a population by genetic drift and/or natural selection, and eventually get established in a species  <cit> . thus, the evolutionary history over a period of multibillion years has its basis in the dna. to understand the molecular evolution of proteins in nature, we usually refer to the relationships and rates of changes in the sequence data inferred from proteins identified so far. more recent advances in bioinformatics and structural biology, besides recombinant protein expression techniques, have enabled us to analyze the molecular evolution of proteins more directly, explore the evolutionary strategies of natural proteins, and generate novel tailor-made proteins.

galectins are defined as proteins having at least one characteristic carbohydrate-recognition domain with ca2+-independent affinity for β-galactoside, and they share certain conserved sequence elements  <cit> . to date,  <dig> galectins have been identified in mammals. they are involved in many biological phenomena, including cell adhesion, differentiation, morphogenesis, innate immunity, apoptosis, and metastasis of malignant cells  <cit> . furthermore, the members of the galectin family have been isolated from a large variety of metazoan phyla, from invertebrates such as nematodes, insects, and sponges to vertebrates such as fish and chicken, as well as mammals  <cit> . on the basis of their structures, galectins are classified into three types: proto-, chimera-, and tandem repeat-type galectins  <cit> .

conger eel  contains two proto-type galectins, namely, congerin i  and congerin ii  in the skin mucus  <cit> . coni and conii consist of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid residues, respectively, and both contain acetylated n-termini  <cit> . however, they have no cysteine residue that is related to oxidizing inactivation found in some galectins of higher vertebrates. congerins are considered to participate in the host defense against infectious agents, such as bacteria and parasites. for example, coni and conii mainly exist in the frontier organs and tissues that delineate the body from the outer environment, such as the epidermal club cells of the skin, wall of the oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, and gills; in addition, they also exhibit agglutination activity against the marine pathogen, vibrio anguillarum  <cit> . moreover, it was recently reported that congerins can exert opsonic effects and can reach the intestinal lumen without enzymatic digestion  <cit> .

the molecular evolutionary and x-ray crystallography analyses of coni and conii revealed that they have evolved in an accelerating manner, resulting in the emergence of new structures, including the strand-swap structure and a unique carbohydrate-binding site; this in turn resulted in a unique carbohydrate-binding ability  <cit> . we recently reconstructed a probable ancestral form of congerin  and found that it showed properties similar to those of conii in terms of thermostability and carbohydrate-recognition specificity, except for α <dig> -sialyl galactose, although con-anc was observed to share a higher sequence similarity with coni than conii  <cit> . this indicates that only the  <dig> different amino acid residues between coni and con-anc are involved in conferring the characteristics of coni, which are acquired during its adaptive molecular evolution from con-anc. to identify the determinants of selection pressures in the evolutionary process and the structural elements associated with the unique carbohydrate-binding activities of coni, in the present study, we focused on the different amino acid residues between con-anc and coni, and conducted a dissection analysis using the chimera mutants of con-anc and coni, tracing its evolutionary history to coni.

RESULTS
design and preparation of the chimeric mutants of con-anc and coni
as the n- and c-terminal regions located at the inter-subunit interface of the congerins and l <dig> region involved in the formation of the lactose-binding site are different for coni and con-anc , first, the n- and c-termini and the l <dig> regions of con-anc were mutagenized. thus, the following  <dig> con-anc mutants were prepared:  con-anc-n/c, in which the n- and c-termini were substituted with the corresponding residues of coni;  con-anc-l <dig>  in which the l <dig> region was substituted with the corresponding sequence of coni; and  con-anc-n/c/l <dig>  which had mutations of both con-anc-n/c and con-anc-l <dig> . as the binding ability of con-anc-n/c/l <dig> was only 30%-40% of that of coni , the other structural elements responsible for the strong binding activity of coni, namely, l <dig> and l <dig> , located at the carbohydrate-binding cleft, were also investigated . thus, the con-anc mutants, in which the l <dig> and l <dig> regions were substituted with the corresponding sequences of coni, i.e., con-anc-n/c/l5/l <dig>  con-anc-n/c/l5/l <dig>  and con-anc-n/c/l5/l6/l <dig> , were prepared, and their carbohydrate-binding activities were determined by frontal affinity chromatography . to analyze the molecular evolutionary relationship among the ancestral mutants and coni, the phylogenetic tree including the chimera mutants between con-anc and coni was constructed . the tree branched out from the node of each mutant with zero distance, suggesting that the chimera mutants are hypothetical ancestral mutants of coni on molecular evolution.

thermostability of con-anc and mutants
carbohydrate-binding properties of con-anc and mutants
the carbohydrate-binding specificities and activities of coni, conii, and con-anc and its mutants, namely, con-anc-n/c, con-anc-l <dig>  con-anc-n/c/l <dig>  con-anc-n/c/l5/l <dig>  con-anc-n/c/l5/l <dig>  and con-anc-n/c/l5/l6/l <dig>  all of which were determined by fac, are summarized in table  <dig>  in the previous report  <cit> , we demonstrated that the sugar-binding specificity of con-anc-l <dig> was similar to that of conii, except for the specific oligosaccharides including lacto-n-biosyl  or lacto-n-neobiosyl  moieties, especially, lacto-n-fucopentaose-ii ) , lacto-n-difucohexaose  , and a-heptasaccharide . however, in the present work, we have demonstrated increased carbohydrate-binding activity of con-anc-n/c/l <dig> with respect to almost all sugars, when compared with those of con-anc. although the binding affinity of con-anc-n/c to sugars decreased, the n- and c-terminal regions of coni was found to increase the binding activity together with the introduction of the l <dig> sequence of coni. therefore, in terms of carbohydrate-binding activity, l <dig> should be the predominant structural element for high binding activity, and the n- and c-terminal regions may play an auxiliary role in carbohydrate binding by increasing the structural stability or slightly altering the structure. con-anc-n/c/l5/l <dig> showed higher affinity toward almost all sugars than con-anc-n/c/l <dig> . interestingly, the specific binding activity of con-anc mutants, namely, con-anc-l <dig>  con-ancn/c/l <dig>  and con-anc-n/c/l5/l <dig>  were greatly increased against lnfp-ii , lnfp-iii , lndfh , and a-heptasaccharide , all of which contained fucosyl-glcnac, by 20- to 30-fold when compared with the affinity of con-anc, and by 3- to 7-fold when compared with that of coni . these results suggest that the l <dig> and l <dig> regions of coni may be involved in the high binding affinity to fucosyl-glcnac-containing sugars such as lnfp-ii , lnfp-iii , lndfh , and a-heptasaccharide . on the other hand, the activity of con-anc-n/c/l5/l6/l <dig> was reduced by approximately 30-50% of that of con-anc-n/c/l5/l <dig> against these carbohydrates , although con-anc-n/c/l5/l <dig> showed almost the same binding activity as con-anc-n/c/l <dig> . these results suggest that thr38/met <dig> residues in l <dig> cooperate with l <dig> to modulate the carbohydrate binding specificity.

furthermore, the structural comparison of sugars, for which each mutant was either recognized specifically or not, showed that con-anc-n/c/l <dig> and con-anc-n/c/l5/l <dig> increased the recognizing specificity to an α <dig> -fucosylated n-acetyl glucosamine  but not α <dig> -fucosylated n-acetyl glucosamine  . this indicates that coni has evolved via accelerated evolution under significant selection pressure to acquire the binding activity to specific carbohydrates including α <dig> -fucosylated n-acetyl glucosamine. it is known that the fucosylation occurs throughout nature and is concerned with the cell-cell interaction and cell migration in the physiological and pathological processes ranging from fertilisation and development through to pathological events and cell death  <cit> . in pathogenic bacterium, the fucosylated oligosaccharides have been found in helicobacter pylori, which is a human pathogenic gram-negative bacterium causing gastritis and gastric adenocarcinoma. fucosylated antigens, lex and ley, expressed on lipopolysaccharide of the microorganism play an important role in the infection, mimic host cell surface glycoconjugates and induce autoantibodies. recently, fucose-specific lectins, f-type lectins, have been isolated from the serum from several fishes such as anguilla japonica  <cit> , anguilla anguilla  <cit> , morone saxatilis  <cit> , sparus aurata  <cit> , and dicentrarchus labrax  <cit> . they have been proposed to play a role as molecular recognition factors in innate immunity. in the case for conger eel, f-type lectins have not yet been identified although c-type lectin and galectins have been isolated from serum and skin mucus  <cit> . these observations permit us to speculate that coni may function as a surrogate of f-type lectin besides the function as galectin in conger eel.

on the other hand, conii showed a binding affinity to α <dig> -sialyl galactose-containing sugars such as gm <dig>  , gm <dig>  , and gd1a as described in a previous report  <cit> , and coni simply could not bind to gm <dig> and gd1a. although con-anc mutants, namely, con-anc-n/c, con-anc-l <dig>  and con-anc-n/c/l <dig>  also showed binding affinities to α <dig> -sialyl galactose-containing sugars--gm <dig>  , gm <dig>  , and gd1a --with very low interactions when compared with conii, con-anc-n/c/l5/l <dig> and con-anc-n/c/l5/l6/l <dig> lost their binding activities against gm <dig>  , gm <dig>  , and gd1a , indicating that the l <dig> and l <dig> structures of conii contribute to the recognition of α <dig> -sialyl galactose . the spr analysis of con-anc mutants using the gm3-immobilized sensor chip confirmed their binding affinity to α <dig> -sialyl galactose-containing sugars . con-anc-n/c and con-anc showed similar gm3-binding activity . on the other hand, con-anc-l <dig> showed decreased affinity to gm <dig> , and con-anc-n/c/l <dig> showed negligible affinity to gm <dig> . these observations indicate that the l <dig> and l <dig> regions of coni are responsible for the strong binding affinities to α <dig> -fucosylated n-acetyl glucosamine in exchange for the binding affinities to α <dig> -sialyl galactose.

molecular dynamics  simulation
l <dig> and l <dig> regions do not directly interact with the bound sugar in the crystal structure of coni, although the mutants of these loops demonstrated significant alterations in the sugar-binding activity. to investigate the roles of these loops in sugar recognition, a 4-ns md simulation of the dimeric coni-lactose complex was performed. cooperative behaviors within and between the loops and sugar-binding residues were evaluated as the correlation coefficients of the hydrogen bond formation rates during the simulation. as a result, high correlations within and between l <dig> and l <dig> were detected . furthermore, the hydrogen bonds between l <dig> and l <dig> revealed a correlation with the bonds connecting arg <dig> and arg <dig> to lactose. on the other hand, l <dig> cooperated with l <dig> through the inter-loop connections mediated by l <dig>  because l2-l <dig> and l2-l <dig> hydrogen bonds were highly correlated . this cooperation of loops, l6-l2-l <dig>  showed a negative correlation with the lactose-binding hydrogen bonds, lac-r <dig> and lac-r <dig>  these observations implied that the l6-l2-l <dig> and l3-l <dig> networks of the loops might have an antagonistic effect on sugar binding. as l <dig> and l <dig> were directly involved in sugar binding, these results suggested that the structural compatibility between loops l3-l <dig> and l6-l2-l <dig> might affect the sugar-binding activity, as observed in the con-anc mutants.

apoptotic activities of con-anc mutants
numerous galectins have been indicated as the functional molecules that control the fate of a cell  <cit> . in particular, there are many reports indicating galectins as apoptosis-inducing factors, e.g., galectin- <dig>  <cit> , galectin- <dig>  <cit> , galectin- <dig>   <cit> , galectin- <dig>  <cit> , and galectin- <dig>  <cit> . it is known that galectin-1-induced apoptosis requires its binding to the glycoproteins, including cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  on the surface of the t-cells  <cit> . these glycoproteins have some o-linked and/or n-linked glycans, and are modified by some glycosyltransferases via alteration of their susceptibility to galectin-1-induced apoptosis  <cit> . in addition, congerins also bind to cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  neuraminidase-treated jurkat cells were 3- and 5-fold more susceptible to coni and conii, respectively, than the non-treated jurkat cells , indicating that the carbohydrate structure on the t-cell surface is important for the induction of apoptosis by congerins.

evolutionary process of congerins from ancestral gene
at the gene duplication event, the ancestral congerin con-anc showed comparable thermostability and similar carbohydrate-binding specificities, with those of conii, except for α <dig> -sialyl galactose-containing sugars such as gm <dig> and gd1a. thus, the gene encoding conii has evolved in an accelerated manner from the ancestral gene to acquire the ability specific to pathogenic marine bacteria via the recognition of α <dig> -sialyl galactose  <cit> . on the other hand, coni has evolved from the ancestral congerin con-anc to increase the binding activity against various sugars by modifying the n- and c-termini and l <dig>  l <dig>  and l <dig> regions. particularly, modifying the l <dig> and l <dig> regions of con-anc to coni showed strong binding specificities against α <dig> -fucosylated n-acetyl glucosamine. these findings emphasize that the carbohydrate-binding ability and the specificities of galectins can be controlled by modifying the loop structures.

in general, the rational designing of protein is a conventional and useful method to study the structure-function relationship of the protein with the partial molecular evolutionary information such as sequence alignments. however, it is difficult to predict and determine the effects of various mutations if several amino acids synergistically act as structural factors and exert multiple effects. in the present study, tracing analysis of molecular evolution of galectins by using ancestral gene and its mutated forms has enabled the more direct investigation of the structure-function relationship of proteins. in fact, we have elucidated the correlations between the molecular evolution  and functional diversification of coni , which have revealed the detailed structural elements responsible for ligand specificity to lnfp-ii, lnfp-iii, lndfh, and a-heptasaccharide , respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
the tracing analysis of molecular evolution, a protein engineering approach employing the reconstruction of probable ancestral forms based on phylogenetic trees and their mutants, is a powerful approach that not only reveals the molecular evolution process and determinants of selection pressures, but also helps to study the structure-function relationships of proteins.
