BACKGROUND
marek's disease  is a highly contagious disease that affects chickens worldwide and is caused by the marek's disease virus , an oncogenic avian herpesvirus. mdv replicates in the lymphoid tissues  <cit>  and is commonly manifested as an acute disease with lymphomas in multiple visceral organs  <cit> . md has a large impact on production, making it the most costly viral disease in the chicken industry  <cit> . it has also been proposed as a natural model for lymphomas that over-express hodgkin's disease antigen   <cit> , and for understanding how vaccines control lymphomas  <cit>  and how pathogenic viruses continue to evolve  <cit> .

the current family selection methods used for improving resistance are based on challenge exposure, and hence are very expensive in terms of selection space, and the financial and ethical cost of routinely challenging large numbers of birds. it is anticipated that identification of qtl for md resistance will eventually allow marker-assisted selection on an individual bird level, without need for routine challenge. this will greatly enhance the accuracy of selection, and reduce costs by orders of magnitude. qtl mapping, in conjunction with positional comparative cloning, gene expression  <cit> , and protein-protein interaction studies  <cit>  could also provide a platform for identification of the genes underlying the qtl. the identification of these genes will provide insight on disease pathways and resistance mechanisms, leading to more effective vaccines or other control strategies, and even more effective selection schemes based on gene-assisted selection  <cit> .

simulation and theoretical studies  <cit>  show that large scale bc or f <dig> experiments can locate qtl of moderate allele substitution effect  only to within a confidence interval of  <dig> to  <dig> cm or more. consequently, darvasi and soller  <cit>  proposed the use of advanced intercross lines  for fine mapping of qtl. an ail is initiated by a cross between two inbred lines, and continued by random intercrossing through successive generations. recombination events between loci accumulate with the advance of the intercross generations. the ail approach has been applied successfully in many mouse studies . a full-sib intercross line   <cit>  is a variant of the ail that is suitable for analysis of outcrossing populations. in a fsil, a single male and female from the same or different populations, are crossed to produce a large full-sibship. the full-sibs are mated at random, and the population continued by random intercrossing to advanced generations. to a large extent, map expansion and qtl resolution in an fsil parallel that in an ail.

previous studies in commercial and non-commercial white leghorn populations have identified genes, qtl and genomic regions associated with resistance to md . heifetz et al.  <cit> , using selective dna pooling, identified  <dig> qtl affecting md resistance in a large reciprocal backcross  between two partially inbred commercial white leghorn layer chicken lines that differed in resistance to md. five of these qtl were previously reported by mcelroy et al.  <cit>  in a smaller study of an independent hatch of one of these bc populations, and four were previously reported by yonash et al.  <cit>  in a study of an f <dig> population generated by a cross between two inbred white leghorn layer lines that differed markedly in resistance to md.

in the present study, a large f <dig> fsil was generated as a continuation of the same f <dig> population from which the bc populations of mcelroy et al.  <cit>  and heifetz et al.  <cit>  were derived. the objective of the study was to confirm previously mapped qtl, improve qtl map resolution, and uncover additional qtl segregating in this population.

RESULTS
survival by family, b type and line
 <dig> the number of individuals in the susceptible pools was low , hence an additional susceptible pool was created, which contained the next most susceptible 20% of birds.

total no., total number of individuals in the f × bt combination; resistant: number of individuals included in the resistant pool , and proportion of individuals that survived to the end of test ; susceptible: number included in the susceptible pool , with their mean and range of survival times in days.

densitometric genotyping
all pools were densitometrically genotyped for microsatellite or snp markers as described in methods, and differences in allele frequency between resistant and susceptible pools  were calculated. in order to validate the markers that had high d-values,  <dig> microsatellite markers were retested across the resistant and susceptible pools of all family × bt combinations. the correlation between first and second genotyping was calculated for each marker separately across all pools. except for one outlier with a correlation of  <dig> , the individual marker correlations ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig> . including the outlier, the overall correlation between the two genotypings was  <dig> . since this correlation represents a double path , this observed correlation of  <dig>  is equivalent to a correlation of  <dig>  between a single genotyping and actual pool content. this high correlation confirms the reliability and accuracy of the pool genotyping results as representing the content of the pools. nevertheless, since both genotypings were done on the same pools, the high correlation does not relate to the degree to which the content of the pools represents the genotypes of the individuals making up the pool.

threshold pfp values for statistical significance
 <dig> power calculated as on/fn to account for 20% false positives included in on.

n, the total number of tests; tn, the estimated number of tests representing true null hypotheses; fn the estimated number of tests representing falsified null hypotheses ; pfp, the  <dig>  pfp cwer p-value thresholds; on, the observed number of marker tests that passed the significance threshold; power, the estimated power of the test; nd, not done.

based on the distribution of marker p-values for the various tests, p-values corresponding to the  <dig>  pfp threshold level were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for z, cs and ia, respectively. for anova, none of the marker tests reached a  <dig>  pfp threshold level. nevertheless, in all cases, p-values for anova tracked those for z very closely. thus, the anova provided strong support for the technical accuracy of the z-tests, but did not provide information additional to that provided by the z-tests. hence, further results for anova are not presented or discussed.

the number of significant markers for each test, and the statistical power of the test are also presented in table  <dig>  power was generally low, indicating that many additional markers may have been in linkage to qtl but did not reach statistical significance. this is to be expected. as a result of the map expansion in the f <dig>  markers "move away" from their qtl. hence, the significance of the test drops, reducing power, even though the marker is still in linkage with the qtl. power for cs was greater than for z. this is probably due to the fact that cs will often be significant when z is significant, and in addition, cs will also be significant when interactions are important, while z will not be significant in these instances. power for ia is also presented, but does not carry much meaning, as the proportion of tests estimated as representing linkage is very low for this test.

qtlr
1these markers were significant for cs, but were not supported by ia. they are included in the list of qtlr, because they corresponded to qtlr previously mapped by  <cit> .

pfp thresholds: z,  <dig> ; cs,  <dig> ; *, non-significant but part of a linked series of significant markers defining a qtlr; italics, markers not included in final count of qtlr because significant only for a single test and marker; §, cs not supported by ia; type, tests for which marker is significant; r at the end of a marker name represents a repeat test of the same marker; spaces between rows delineate the individual qtlr.

based on table  <dig>  qtlr and non-q regions, as defined in methods, are listed in table  <dig>  which shows the total number of markers in each region  and the location of the markers defining the start and end points of each region. for qtlr, the statistical tests for which the region is significant, the estimated allele substitution effect on survival time, and overlap with regions of significance in heifetz et al.  <cit>  and yonash et al.  <cit>  are also shown. a total of  <dig> qtlr were identified. of these,  <dig> were significant for cs only, while  <dig> were significant for z either alone  or for z as well as cs . for six of the regions, qtl location and confidence interval, as determined by ia, are also shown in the table.

 <dig> also supported by mcelroy et al., 

chr., chromosome; reg., region; m, number of markers in the region; test, z, significant by z-test; c, significant by chi-square and supported by ia; location, cm of the markers flanking the region, in italics following semi-colon location and  by ia; effect, allele substitution effect of the region; bc, allele substitution effect and location in heifetz et al. ; y, region of significance in yonash et al. .

eight of the qtlr corresponded to qtlr that were previously identified by heifetz et al.  <cit>  in the reciprocal bc populations generated from these lines. as noted above, however, two of these  were of borderline significance in the f <dig> and were included among the f <dig> qtlr because of support from the heifetz et al.  <cit>  study. in addition, three of the qtlr corresponded to significant qtl reported by yonash et al.  <cit> , of which one was also reported in the heifetz et al.  <cit>  study. thus  <dig> out of  <dig> qtlr identified in the f <dig> were supported by other studies of these lines or of other leghorn layer lines.

the total absolute allele substitution effect summed across all  <dig> qtlr was  <dig>  days, with a mean absolute allele substitution effect of  <dig>  days. this compares well with the mean absolute allele substitution effect of  <dig>  days for the qtlr identified in the heifetz et al  <cit>  study when based on combined data of the two bcs. of the  <dig> qtlr,  <dig> presented positive effects, indicating that the resistant allele originated from line  <dig> , and  <dig> presented negative effects, indicating that the resistant allele originated from line  <dig> . this corresponds to the results of the bc analysis  <cit> , in which case also resistance alleles originating from line  <dig> were uncovered. the total summed effect for survival time, across all  <dig> loci including algebraic sign, was  <dig>  days in favor of line  <dig>  although not directly comparable, this is in accord with the observed difference of  <dig> % in proportion of survivors in favor of line  <dig>  found in the present study.

when some of the same qtl are uncovered in independent genome scans, this supports the validity of these qtl. however, since independent scans will have some qtl in common and some that differ, it is always possible that at least some of the shared qtl represent chance type i errors that happened to occur in the same chromosomal region. the likelihood of this decreases when the common qtl share specific qualities, other than their quantitative effect. for example, in a previous study of qtl affecting milk yield and protein percent in brown swiss dairy cattle  <cit> , it was found that qtl identified in the brown swiss breed shared specificity  with those identified in the holstein breed. this was taken as strong support for the reality of these qtl. similarly, in the present study, the identified qtl have specificity in terms of direction of effect  and magnitude of effect. it is striking, therefore, that of the  <dig> qtlr that were found in the present study and also in the heifetz et al.  <cit>  study, the same  <dig> had positive effects in both studies, and the same one had a negative effect in both studies. the likelihood of either of these events is low, although within the realm of chance. furthermore, the correlation between estimated signed allele effects of the common qtlr in the f <dig> and bc was  <dig>  ; the correlation increased to  <dig>   if an exceptional value  is excluded. thus, the nearly significant correspondence of algebraic sign for the common qtlr of the two studies, and the significant correlation of their estimated effects strongly supports their underlying reality. the preponderance of positive effects among the qtlr that were common to the two studies, suggest that these are the qtlr that contributed to the superior resistance of line  <dig> 

the mean minimum and maximum width of the qtlr identified in this study was  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm respectively; if qtlr defined by a single marker are excluded, the minimum extent becomes  <dig>  cm. the mean extent of a qtlr, as defined by ia was  <dig>  cm. comparable values calculated for the qtlr defined in the heifetz et al.  <cit>  bc study  were a minimum extent of  <dig>  cm ; a maximum extent of  <dig>  cm, and a mean extent from ia of  <dig>  cm. the mean extent for the f <dig> qtlr, defined by all four measures, was  <dig>  cm; the corresponding value for the bc qtlr was  <dig> . thus, qtl map resolution appears to have been reduced by half in the f <dig> as compared to the bc populations. this corresponds almost exactly to the calculated degree of map expansion in this population based on unpublished data .

discussion
mhc type b15/b <dig> was clearly more resistant than b2/b <dig> and b2/b <dig>  but the resistance appeared to be fully recessive, as the heterozygote was virtually identical to the b2/b <dig> homozygote. similar results were obtained in the reciprocal backcross study of these founder lines  <cit> . this was somewhat unexpected, as a number of studies comparing the influence of various mhc haplotypes on md in different strains of chickens found that the b <dig> haplotype is frequently associated with greater resistance  <cit> . these data are, however consistent with others that suggest that some genes may interact to complement the mhc haplotype influence  <cit> .

the qtl results of this study accord well with those of the previous reciprocal backcross study of these lines  <cit> . in the bc case, a total of  <dig> qtlr were identified. of these,  <dig> qtlr were significant for cs only,  <dig> were significant for anova or z, of which  <dig> were also significant for cs. three-fifths of the qtlr identified in the previous study were also identified in the present study, and the effects of the common qtlr were identical in sign, and highly correlated in magnitude.

considering the three main md resistance qtl-mapping studies, the present f <dig> and the bc  <cit>  experiments between them identified all four of the significant yonash et al.  <cit>  qtl;  <dig> qtl were common to the f <dig> and bc  <cit>  experiments; while  <dig> and  <dig> were uniquely identified by the f <dig> and bc  <cit>  experiments, respectively. thus, among them these experiments uncovered a total of  <dig> qtl affecting md resistance. lack of full correspondence between the present f <dig> and previous bc  <cit>  experiments, which were carried out in populations derived from the same founder lines, can be attributed to the partial power of the experiments. assuming a total of  <dig> qtl, power of the f <dig> experiment would be  <dig>   and that of the bc experiments would be  <dig>  . these power estimates seem reasonable considering the size and design of the experiments and magnitude of the qtl effects uncovered, and the difference between the power estimates for the f <dig> and bc experiments is far from statistical significance. for experiments of comparable size and qtl of comparable effects, f <dig> and reciprocal backcross designs should provide equivalent statistical power  <cit> . thus the observed difference in power of the two experiments is best attributed to sampling variation.

overall, line  <dig> contributed about twice as many resistance alleles as line  <dig>  as would be expected from the relative resistance of the two lines. curiously, in the present study, the pure line controls of line  <dig> and line  <dig> displayed much higher resistance , compared to the f <dig> . thus, interactions of the background genome appear to have major effects on the expression of resistance  <cit> . the fact that the cross of the two lines was more susceptible than each of the individual lines is consistent with other indications that the qtl alleles that confer resistance in these lines are recessive, so that the cross shows negative heterosis for resistance. this stands in some contrast to the results of stone  <cit> , who conducted a number of crosses between adol resistant and susceptible lines and concluded that md resistance was dominant, and of yonash et al.  <cit> , who found that at a majority of their identified qtl, the resistant alleles were dominant. the results are, however, consistent with the heifetz et al.  <cit>  study, in that qtl mapping in the reciprocal backcross populations developed from these founder lines identified different qtl, as would be expected if qtl for resistance are recessive. the hypothesis that resistance alleles are recessive also predicts that the f <dig> should identify qtl that came to expression in both of the reciprocal bc populations. in this regard, eight of the qtl identified in the bc populations corresponded to qtl identified in the f <dig>  of these, one was specific to bc <dig>  three were specific to bc <dig>  and four were found in both bc's. seven of the qtl mapped in the bc, however, did not have corresponding qtlr in the f <dig>  the simplest explanation for these negative results may be the incomplete power of the two experiments, which appreciably reduces the likelihood that the same qtl will be found in the two experiments.

three of the qtlr identified in the f <dig> were also identified in the yonash et al.,  <cit>  study. this is particularly noteworthy, since the challenge strain in the yonash et al.  <cit>  study was jm/102w, which is a virulent  mdv strain, but less pathogenic than the vv+ mdv strain 648a used in the present study. thus, this lends some support to the widely held assumption that qtl conferring resistance to one mdv strain will confer resistance to another as well, at least in white leghorns where genetic diversity is limited.

considering qtl map locations in the bc as compared to the f <dig>  there is a clear tendency for distinctly narrower qtlr in the f <dig> than in the bc; average qtlr extent in the f <dig> was just about half that in the bc, as anticipated from the observed map expansion in the f <dig>  additional genotyping at higher marker density across the qtlr is clearly warranted to obtain full benefit of the f <dig> map expansion.

counting all resistance qtl uncovered in the two bc populations by heifetz et al.  <cit>  and in the f <dig> in the present study, gives a total of  <dig> qtl; eight common to both series of crosses,  <dig> uncovered only in the f <dig>  and  <dig> uncovered only in the bc populations. of the  <dig> common qtlr,  <dig> were significant by z or by z and cs, indicating important main effects. these results should provide a strong platform for comparative positional cloning, after confirmation of the associations by individual genotyping of the pools. comparative functional genomics based on the complete chicken genome sequence could be used to identify candidate genes in the identified chromosomal regions. as a preliminary exercise, we have searched build  <dig> of the chicken genome across  <dig> cm centered at each of three regions which had narrow widths in the present study, and corresponded to regions of significance in  <cit>  or  <cit> , namely: qtlr 2-ii , centered at adl <dig> at about  <dig>  mb; qtlr 8-ii , centered at hyl <dig> at about  <dig>  mb; and qtlr 9-ii , centered at lei <dig> at about  <dig>  mb. the most likely candidate gene in qtlr 2-ii is ptprn <dig>  at  <dig>  mb . ptp family members are signalling molecules that regulate many cellular processes, including cell growth, and have been implicated in oncogenic transformation. qtlr 8-ii contains two interesting candidate genes: cd <dig> antigen, at  <dig>  mb  and pigk , at  <dig>  mb . cd <dig> antigen is a receptor involved in cell adhesion and signalling, that is present on the surface of most activated leukocytes. mdv is thought to infect and transform only activated cd4+ t cells. consequently, cell adhesion might assist the virus transmission from one infected cell to another, as mdv is highly cell associated. pigk is a subunit of the gpi transamidase complex that catalyzes the attachment of gpi  to proteins. gpi is a membrane anchor for cell surface proteins. as such it provides for rapid protein release in response to a stimulus, since the protein bound by the gpi anchor can be immediately released without a requirement for rna or protein synthesis. in this context it is relevant that sca <dig>  has a gpi anchor, and is one of the most strongly documented md resistance genes  <cit> . for qtlr 9-ii, using lei <dig>  as the reference point, we were unable to find any attractive candidate genes. this may in part be because the biology of md resistance is not well defined. a further contributing factor is the fact that much of the chicken gene annotation is inferred by electronic annotation and not by experimental evidence. consequently, one can speculate about almost any gene being involved in viral replication and spread, or cellular transformation, especially as the biomedical literature is slanted heavily towards cancer.

these and other candidate genes can be screened further by examining their mrna expression pattern under mdv challenge, using existing data banks. however, they could also readily be examined for linkage disequilibrium with md resistance by constructing appropriate resource populations using the existing data and sample banks accumulated at hy-line through the routine md challenge and testing component of their regular commercial breeding program. such association tests could also be implemented by selective dna pooling, perhaps using the new fractioned pool designs  <cit>  to increase power and accuracy.

CONCLUSIONS
if the resistance alleles are recessive and at low to moderate allele frequencies, this would explain the slow response to selection for increased resistance, and enhances the need for mapping in order to increase the effectiveness of selection on these qtl within the pure lines. because most chickens used for commercial egg or meat production are crosses between  <dig> to  <dig> lines, it will be important that the recessive resistance alleles are present in all pure lines, such that the cross will be homozygous for the resistance qtl. for lines that lack the resistance alleles, which would need to be determined as a first step, it might be most effective to introgress resistance alleles from one line to another. achieving this, without losing the heterosis for production traits that characterizes the cross of these commercial lines, could only be achieved through marker or preferably gene assisted introgression focused on the limited genome regions carrying the resistance alleles.
