BACKGROUND
a key objective of global gene expression studies is the identification of transcription factors and their dna binding sites responsible for co-expression of genes. dna binding sites can be predicted in silico by searching regulatory regions of co-expressed genes for overrepresented motifs  <cit> . recently, the genome sequence of maize  was released  <cit> , facilitating searches for cis-acting motifs in one of the world’s most important crops. useful motif discovery tools already exist for maize including grassius  <cit>  and plantpan  <cit> , but they retrieve only known, experimentally defined motifs from databases such as place  <cit>  or planttfdb  <cit> . there remains a need for software that predicts de novo motifs from co-expressed genes in maize including from microarray data.

in general, two major types of algorithms exist to search co-regulated genes for de novo motifs. the first approach, consensus searching, consists of searching sets of genes for similar sequences. this consensus method limits motif searches to  <dig> bases in length  and allows for a few substitutions  <cit> . weeder  <cit>  is a widely used program that applies consensus-based sampling. the second type of search algorithm is probabilistic and uses a position weight matrix  to define a motif  <cit> . in the pwm, the probability of occurrence of each of the four possible nucleotides is calculated for every position within a predicted motif. motif pwms are first identified by scanning regulatory sequences for similar motifs. predicted motifs are reported if the probability of the motif occurrence is statistically non-random compared to the background. widely used software programs that apply a probabilistic algorithm are bioprospector  <cit>  and meme   <cit> . these programs employ different statistical approaches. bioprospector uses gibbs sampling  <cit>  which randomly picks subsequences of a defined length and iteratively searches within input promoters until a high probability match is found, defined as having pwm values that are significantly different from the input background sequences. by contrast, meme divides sequences into sub-segments, and all sub-segments are systematically processed as a possible motif. the probability that each sub-segment occurs non-randomly within input promoters is calculated based on its pwm values  which is then refined based on the probability of occurrence of each nucleotide at each position within the sub-segment . the sub-segment with the highest probability after em is chosen and modified by iterating the em algorithm until a candidate motif cannot be improved  <cit> .

the various motif discovery programs have significant limitations. for example, one limit of gibbs sampling and hence bioprospector  <cit> , is that different motifs are often obtained at each run. in contrast, meme predictions are consistent  <cit> . the main problem with all the current motif discovery programs is their low accuracy. the best motif discovery program thus far was shown to be only  <dig> % accurate, in e.coli, with many known motifs being missed  <cit> . in order to overcome the problem of low prediction accuracy, motif discovery programs have been combined to increase their effectiveness, creating what has been termed an ensemble algorithm  <cit> . one of the first ensemble algorithms was the best program  <cit>  which combined the advantages of three motif discovery programs. other ensemble tools also exist to define de novo motifs in arabidopsis and rice, for example motifvoter  <cit>  that clusters the best motifs from  <dig> motif discovery tools. however, most ensemble algorithms are conservative because they report only motifs that are retrieved by more than one of the motif discovery programs  <cit> . to help researchers evaluate motif discovery programs objectively, benchmark data sets have been created, in which known motifs are embedded into diverse sequences  <cit> . each motif discovery program can then be compared based on the rate of true and false predictions.

ideally, a motif discovery program for maize should be validated by its ability to retrieve transcription factor binding sites that have been experimentally validated. some of the best studied transcription factor targets in maize are those of c <dig> and p, transcription factors which upregulate the biosynthetic enzymes responsible for production of the red-purple pigments, anthocyanin and phlobaphene, respectively  <cit> . c <dig> and p are homologous proteins belonging to the r2r <dig> myb family of regulators  <cit> , and they have been shown to interact with identical cis-acting motifs in the a <dig> promoter  <cit> .

in this study, first, a benchmark data set was used to compare and evaluate the accuracy of the three most used motif discovery programs, weeder, bioprospector and meme. improvements were then created to reduce the limitations of each program. these improvements were incorporated into a comprehensive motif discovery pipeline customized for maize called promzea. promzea was then validated by asking whether it could retrieve known binding sites of maize c <dig> and p transcription factors  <cit> .

promzea accurately identified these binding sites, in particular those for p, using only a small number of input genes from these pathways. interestingly, in a genome-wide scan, promzea retrieved these binding sites in additional genes, including upstream genes that may help to regulate these pathways. promzea was also tested against the maize development atlas, a tissue-specific microarray dataset resource for maize  <cit> .

implementation
overview of promzea
an online pipeline called promzea was developed to discover de novo cis-acting elements in maize  using a user-friendly interface created in perl. promzea is publicly available at http://www.promzea.org. the tool was subsequently expanded to include rice and arabidopsis. for rationale and complete methodological details, see additional file  <dig>  here only an overview of promzea is provided, along with key parameters below. briefly, using the online interface, the user first submits either a list of co-expressed cdna fasta sequence files, a microarray probe-set id , gene id list or a bed file  <cit> , for example with chromosome coordinates corresponding to peaks from chip-seq experiments  <cit> . in the case of a cdna file, the sequences are blast searched against the chosen plant genome. a list of corresponding promoters to the user input is retrieved from a maize promoter database . a command line version of the program is also available in the discovery environment of the iplant collaborative  <cit> ; in this version, users can use as input a bed file allowing them to search for motifs within peaks discovered by chip-seq or chip-chip experiments  <cit> . the promoter data set is then searched for shared motifs using three motif discovery programs: meme, bioprospector and weeder . these motif discovery programs were chosen based on using algorithms that allowed for fast and accurate and/or complimentary searching. the justification for combining multiple motif discovery programs is described in additional file  <dig>  the motif results are filtered, combined from all three programs, ranked and then displayed for the user along with a ranking score . finally, promzea searches the chosen plant genome for genes containing each candidate motif, providing the user with the complete gene list and corresponding gene annotations, along with other forms of validation for the user to analyze .

parameters of motif discovery programs used in promzea
meme was set to search for ten motifs with a maximum length of  <dig> nucleotides on both dna strands. bioprospector was set to search for 10-nucleotide long motifs and retain only the first ten motifs found. weeder was set to search for motifs ranging in length from 6– <dig> nucleotides . in addition, fimo  <cit> , pscan  <cit>  and clover  <cit>  were used to retrieve motifs from the maize genome.

defining filters for each standalone program within promzea using benchmark data sets
as noted above, within promzea, a custom filter was designed for each of the three motif discovery programs employed; the purpose was to reduce the false discovery ratio  while preserving the true positives as measured using the nucleotide correlation coefficient . both nfdr and ncc are defined in additional file  <dig>  the filter parameters were optimized using the sandve et al.  benchmark data set  <cit>  based on limiting the probability  that a motif prediction could occur randomly; the best filters were chosen based on their impact on the nfdr and ncc scores. for bioprospector, pb thresholds at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  significantly reduced the average nfdr score . though the average ncc scores between the filtered data were not significantly different from one another, the filter pb =  <dig>  was chosen for bioprospector as it caused the least absolute reduction in the ncc score average compared to the unfiltered data . for meme, a significance level of  <dig>  was chosen as it achieved the best balance between a significant reduction in the nfdr average  and a significant increase in the ncc average . for weeder, a significance level of  <dig>  was selected as it similarly achieved the best balance between a significant reduction in the average nfdr score  and the largest absolute increase in the average ncc score .

defining the ranking of post-filtered motifs
in order to rank the predicted remaining motifs after filtering and then combining the results of all three motif discovery programs, promzea incorporates a published metric, the mean normalized conditional probability or mncp  <cit>  . briefly mncp is based on the biological principle that if a promoter/first intron contains multiple occurrences of a given motif, then the chance that motif is non-random is higher. specifically, the mncp score allows one to determine if the mean occurrence of any given motif in the data set  is higher than its mean occurrence in a random set of promoters/first introns . a motif with a higher mncp score has a lower probability of being false.

generating the promzea software pipeline
the above filtering and ranking principles were integrated into the promzea software pipeline . to match the user input cdna to the maize genome, full-length cdnas were retrieved from the maize, rice and arabidopsis genomes using their gff files and respective genome data  <cit> . for each predicted gene, the corresponding promoters were compiled into a list: the flat file containing ≤1 kb of upstream sequences consisted of  <dig>  predicted promoters in the case of maize,  <dig>  promoters for arabidopsis and  <dig>  promoters for rice . at least 70% of the maize genome and 35% of the rice genome are composed of transposable elements  <cit>  which could generate false-positives. in order to overcome this problem, repeat-masked sequences were used to create the promoter flat files. another problem in motif prediction is the presence of distal cis-acting elements possibly located up to 50 kb from the transcription starting site  <cit> . however, a maximum length of 1 kb was chosen because motif discovery algorithms struggle with larger search spaces which dilute the signal strength, and it is difficult to anticipate the exact position of a distal cis-acting element. taking these limitations into account, for motif discovery in promzea, we applied the same parameters for motif discovery and filtering as used in the sandve et al.  benchmark validation . in promzea, the final filtered set of motifs is represented for the user as consensus sequence logos using weblogo software  <cit> . the predicted motifs are ranked using their mncp scores . as false positives were observed in the predictions using the benchmark data set, promzea gives the user quality control visualizations to validate each predicted motif. one such validation is whether the motif is located at a similar position within promoters of different genes. the frequency of motif occurrence at each position, as defined by each motif discovery program, is shown as a graphic using the chart: clicker perl module  <cit> . another validation is whether promzea retrieves promoters of genes consistent with a common genetic pathway, by searching the maize genome for promoters containing each candidate motif. for this form of validation using gene annotations, all the genes having a defined gene ontology annotation were compiled into flat files using data from the gene ontology project of each genome.

RESULTS
in silico validation of filtering then combining motif discovery programs using benchmark data sets
to generate a motif discovery tool, the effectiveness of existing motif discovery tools was first analyzed using benchmark data sets containing known motifs from sandve et al. . when bioprospector  was applied to the three types of benchmark data sets from sandve et al. , the average number of true positive motifs  predicted was  <dig> while the number of false positives  was  <dig>  . unfiltered meme predicted an average of  <dig> ntps correctly, but also  <dig>  nfps. by contrast, unfiltered weeder predicted two-fold more ntps  but a very high average number of nfps . however, each of the three standalone motif discovery programs appeared to identify different sets of motifs . it was thus hypothesized that combining the programs  would increase the total number of true positives. in fact, combining the programs increased the number of ntps to  <dig>  a >50% increase compared to the best standalone program, weeder, under the software parameters chosen . however, combining the programs also increased the number of nfps compared to each standalone program. filtering each motif discovery program separately  before combining the results reduced the average nfps by  <dig> % compared to the combined unfiltered data yet only reduced ntps by  <dig> % . the ncc score after combining all three filtered programs was not significantly different compared to each standalone program, likely because ntps and nfps both increased .

the table shows the numbers illustrated in figure 3a-c. each value is the average result of three runs for each standalone unfiltered program, as well as the scores after combining the outputs of the three programs without filtering  or with filtering .

compared to each standalone program, combining all three filtered programs also significantly improved the ratio of software-predicted true positives versus the actual number of real motif nucleotides . the nsn increased by 22% compared to the most sensitive standalone program, weeder, under the conditions used .

the effectiveness of our strategy was further demonstrated by examining the origin of the final predicted ntps after all three filtered results had been combined. of the final number of ntps retrieved from the benchmark data set, 41% were found to have been discovered by weeder alone, 16% from meme alone and 10% from bioprospector alone . only 33% of ntps had been found by two or three of the standalone programs. this result confirms that widely used motif discovery programs retrieve distinct sets of motifs and that combining the predictions increases the chance of discovering new regulatory motifs.

concerning motif ranking using the mncp score, the analysis using the benchmark model real data set showed that as the mncp score of a predicted motif increased, the chance that it was composed of nucleotide false positives decreased .

validation of promzea by comparing motif predictions to experimentally defined motifs in the maize anthocyanin and phlobaphene biosynthetic pathways
the effectiveness of promzea was tested based on its ability to detect experimentally defined binding sites for the maize transcription factors, c <dig> and p, which upregulate enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of anthocyanin and phlobaphene, respectively   <cit> . eight gene promoters containing the c <dig> and p binding sites were selected . the corresponding cdnas , were used as input into promzea following the parameters described . promzea retrieved  <dig> genes that matched these cdnas after blast searching ; from the corresponding promoters, five motifs were identified along with their mncp scores .

of the five motifs predicted by promzea with mncp scores > <dig>  two matched the experimentally defined p binding sites . the partially related c <dig> motif was found in motif <dig> as described below. based on stamp  <cit> , promzea motif <dig> and motif <dig> were found to be highly similar to the two versions of the experimentally defined binding site of the p-protein   <cit> . interestingly, motif <dig> and motif <dig> were overrepresented in the − <dig> to − <dig> and − <dig> to − <dig> promoter regions respectively , consistent with the experimentally defined − <dig> to − <dig> binding site of p in the a <dig> promoter  <cit> . motif <dig> was also overrepresented in the − <dig> to − <dig> promoter region , which was consistent with the other experimentally binding sites of p in the a <dig> promoter at − <dig> to − <dig>  <cit> . promzea-predicted motif <dig> or motif <dig> were also retrieved in four out of the five input promoters shown experimentally to contain a p binding site in their promoters ; copies of the p binding site were also predicted in the first 200 bp of the promoter of pal <dig>  encoding phenylalanine ammonia lyase .

promzea-predicted motif <dig> was statistically close  to the mre binding site identified in an arabidopsis chalcone synthase promoter  <cit>  . in arabidopsis, the mre motif mediates light responsiveness  <cit> . motif <dig> was retrieved by promzea in the maize chalcone synthase  promoter but also in six out of seven other input gene promoters, validating this promzea prediction .

promzea-predicted motif <dig> was similar to motif aciipvpal <dig>  discovered in beans  <cit> . the aciipvpal2-like element was found in the promoter of pal <dig> , an ortholog of the maize pal genes necessary for the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoid secondary metabolites including anthocyanins. pal <dig> is the rate-limiting step in anthocyanin biosynthesis. promzea retrieved the aciipvpal2-like motif in the promoters of pal <dig> and four additional anthocyanin genes , again validating promzea predictions. interestingly, the ca-rich region at the beginning of motif <dig> was related to the c <dig> consensus binding site  that was previously defined experimentally  <cit> .

the ability of promzea to retrieve promoter motifs associated with the anthocyanin pathway that were defined experimentally not only in maize, but in also in other plant species, validates promzea as an accurate tool for motif discovery.

a novel candidate motif in the anthocyanin pathway and expansion of the regulatory network to the branched amino acid metabolic pathway
promzea also retrieved motif <dig> as a candidate motif in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway, a motif not previously defined experimentally . promzea motif <dig> was retrieved from the promoter of a <dig> and additional paralogs of genes in the anthocyanin pathway . motif  <dig> was over-represented in the − <dig> to − <dig> promoter regions of these promoters . in a subsequent search of the maize genome, motif  <dig> was retrieved in a total of  <dig> promoters ; the over-represented go annotations of the corresponding genes, based on the hypergeometric test, identified these genes as being related to zinc ion binding  and branched chain family amino acid metabolic processes  . the latter annotation was also enriched in the four other predicted motifs . as anthocyanin and phlobaphene are derived from phenylalanine, a branched amino acid, this finding appears to validate novel motif <dig> as well as the promzea pipeline, and predicts that anthocyanin biosynthesis may be transcriptionally coordinated with branched chain amino acid biosynthesis.

promzea retrieved additional genes that contain the same candidate motifs as the anthocyanin input promoters
as noted above for motif <dig>  each motif predicted by promzea from the anthocyanin pathway was used to search the genome to retrieve genes containing that motif . interestingly, the five motifs were associated with the same go annotations: branched chain family amino acid metabolic process, heat shock protein binding, myosin complex or motor activity . in total, promzea retrieved between  <dig> genes  and  <dig> genes  with promoters enriched for any one of these motifs .

interestingly, promzea retrieved  <dig> genes with promoters that contained all five motifs in the −200 bp regions of their promoters . this list included genes encoding: pal <dig>  the rate-limiting step in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis which includes anthocyanins; branched amino acid enzymes ; abc-type transporters ; and regulatory proteins including transcription factors and kinases. intriguingly, all five anthocyanin promoter motifs were also predicted in the promoters of genes similar to those involved in coordinating sugar, light, cold-temperature and low phosphate dependent activation of anthocyanin biosynthesis, namely: genes similar to gibberellin receptor gid1l <dig> and gibberellin  <dig> oxidase; genes similar to those encoding the light-regulatory pathway proteins cop <dig> and pif <dig>  and numerous sugar transfer/modification enzymes .

these data demonstrate that the genome-wide motif retrieval function of promzea may allow researchers to predict new genes that may be part of a broader co-regulated network.

testing of promzea using the maize development atlas
to further test the promzea pipeline using data similar to a typical user, microarray data was used from the maize development atlas, a microarray data set of tissue-specific gene expression  <cit> . select motifs associated with each tissue are presented  as well as all predicted motifs .

as one case study, a list of  <dig> embryo-specific transcripts was used as input into promzea  from which  <dig> associated promoter motifs were predicted . using clover, promzea then retrieved genes associated with promoters in the genome that contained these motifs along with their associated go annotation terms: genes enriched with any one of nine of the  <dig> motifs were annotated as having nutrient reservoir activity , consistent with the embryo being part of the seed. predicted embryo motif <dig> and motif <dig> were highly similar to the abadesi <dig> cis-acting element , known to be involved in aba dependent desiccation during seed maturation  <cit> .

as another case study, a total of  <dig> tassel-specific transcripts were investigated using promzea, from which  <dig> motifs were predicted . genes enriched with any one of  <dig> out of the  <dig> motifs in their promoters were annotated as being involved in sexual reproduction  consistent with the function of the tassel .

from another reproductive tissue, the silk,  <dig> tissue-specific transcripts were entered into promzea . promzea predicted  <dig> promoter motifs enriched in the promoters of the associated genes, of which six motifs were enriched in promoters retrieved from genome-wide searches, associated with genes involved in sucrose metabolism; other motifs were enriched in genes associated with defence responses to fungi , which is consistent with this tissue .

interestingly, motifs similar to the nonamer motif or nonamerath <dig> motif  were most frequently predicted by promzea in silks , roots  and leaves  . this motif was discovered in the promoter of the arabidopsis gene encoding histone  <dig>  <cit> . a mutation in histone  <dig> was shown to be deleterious to cell specificity of gene expression  <cit> .

these results appear to confirm that promzea retrieves meaningful motifs associated with co-expressed, tissue-specific genes in data sets that would be typical of users.

discussion
promzea provides the plant community with a customized interface to detect de novo cis-acting motifs that are over-represented in the promoters or introns of co-expressed maize genes. by filtering and combining the results of multiple standalone motif discovery programs, promzea predicts more true motifs than current individual programs without increasing the false discovery ratio . for each run output, promzea provides a ranking of the predicted motifs based on their mncp scores . an mncp score of ≤ <dig> means that the motif is more frequently present in a random set of maize sequences than the user data set of co-expressed genes. mncp scores can help eliminate motifs that have a general function in the plant and that are not necessary specific to a condition . false positives caused by transposons and retro-elements, which are abundant in the maize and rice genomes  <cit> , were reduced by the use of repeat masked promoter data in addition to the use of mncp scores. false positives are a problem in any motif discovery program; furthermore, cis-acting motifs regulate genes at different biological levels that may or may not be of interest . given these caveats, promzea generates additional outputs to help a user decide which motif to pursue, placing the emphasis back on the user. promzea searches the maize genome for genes that contain each predicted motif; the corresponding gene annotations are summarized so that a user can decide whether the predicted motif is relevant to the input gene cluster . as gene annotations can be limiting, promzea also generates the complete list of genes that contain each predicted motif ; a user can then search the list using relevant keywords to determine whether a predicted motif retrieves expected genes. promzea thus narrows the number of candidate cis- acting motifs for subsequent experimental validation. promzea should be especially useful to molecular biologists for the prediction of specific promoters for transgene research and targeted maize improvement; few such promoters currently exist for the maize community.

users can maximize the utility of promzea. first, prior to using promzea, it is critical for the user to define robust clusters of co-expressed genes since motif discovery can be diluted by the presence of extra genes that are not part of the real gene network of interest  <cit> . second, it is important for the user to know that promzea employs algorithms that are stochastic in nature, including bioprospector and the selection of random background sequences required for the filtering process. as a result, each promzea run can generate slightly different outputs. users are recommended to run promzea multiple times to verify the uniformity of their results. finally, promzea does not compare predicted motifs to motifs previously defined by the research community; for this, the user is encouraged to use stamp to match a motif to online databases  <cit> , or matalign  <cit>  for comparisons to motifs found in the literature . matalign may also be used to compare the different motifs predicted by promzea to determine if there are likely duplicates.

in this study, the promzea pipeline was validated, first, by its ability to retrieve experimentally defined binding sites for transcription factors that regulate the maize anthocyanin and phlobaphene biosynthetic pathways   <cit> . our case study revealed that promzea could potentially identify motifs not only from co-expression data, but also from a virtual data set, which might be expected to have a common cis-acting motif, such as in promoters of genes belonging to a specific biochemical pathway . our case study also demonstrated that promzea could not only retrieve valid cis-acting motifs, but could make novel predictions about the corresponding biological network, as  <dig> genes in the maize genome had promoters containing all five predicted motifs in the first 200 bp of their promoters . promzea has thus predicted a broader putative co-regulated gene network than has been identified experimentally, a finding that will need further investigation.

promzea was also tested using tissue-specific microarray data from the maize development atlas  <cit>  since this type of data is similar to that of a typical promzea user . go annotations of genes enriched for promoter motifs predicted by promzea appeared to be logical for the specific tissue : for instance, the go term ‘sexual reproduction’ was over-represented in  <dig> out of  <dig> motifs predicted for tassel-specific transcripts, while the go term ‘nutrient reserve’ was over-represented in  <dig> out of  <dig> embryo predicted motifs. motifs in some tissues were associated with go annotations that were not expected, or else there were multiple go annotations, perhaps suggesting the importance of biological sampling: for example, separating cell types may be critical for software to predict meaningful cis-acting elements.

as a final lesson, it is noteworthy that mutants in maize transcription factors c <dig> and p were isolated and characterized 100 years ago  <cit> . the genes encoding these transcription factors began to be isolated 70–80 years later  <cit> . the binding sites for c <dig> and p were defined biochemically one decade later  <cit> . our study shows that the bioinformatics prediction of cis-acting motifs may help to uncover genetic relationships even in well-studied biological pathways, in this case additional genes that are putatively co-regulated with genes encoding anthocyanin and phlobaphene biosynthetic enzymes.

CONCLUSIONS
there was a need for a software program to help maize researchers identify de novo cis-acting motifs underlying co-expressed suites of genes. here, we analyzed the accuracy of the most widely used motif discovery programs and showed that they had limited accuracy and retrieved distinct sets of motifs. we applied statistical filters to reduce the false discovery ratios of these programs and then combined the search results to improve motif prediction, and validated this approach using benchmark data. these principles were integrated into an online software program for motif discovery that was customized for maize called promzea. promzea was subsequently expanded to include rice and arabidopsis. promzea was able to retrieve experimentally defined binding sites of maize transcription factors known to regulate the anthocyanin and phlobaphene biosynthetic pathways. interestingly, the genome-wide motif discovery function of promzea predicted a broader network of co-regulated genes. promzea was also tested using tissue specific microarray data from maize as input. promzea should be a useful tool for de novo predictions of cis-acting motifs from transcriptome data. promzea is publicly available at http://www.promzea.org and on the discovery environment of the iplant collaborative website.
