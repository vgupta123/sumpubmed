BACKGROUND
in present time, cellulases have attracted much attention because of their application in various industrials processes, including food, textiles, laundry, pulp and paper as well as in agriculture  <cit> . cellulases contribute to 8% of the worldwide industrial enzyme load and the demand is expected to increase by 100% within  <dig>  <cit> . the increasing concern about the shortage of remnant energy, the release of green house gasses by incomplete burning of fossil fuel which create air pollution have resulted in rising center on the use of cellulases to carry out enzymatic hydrolysis of the lignocellulosic waste materials for the production of bioethanol  <cit> . cellulases have a group of three enzymes namely endo- <dig> -β-glucnase , exo- <dig> -β-glucnase  and β-glucosidase that synergistically hydrolyzed cellulose into soluble sugars and glucose  <cit> . endogluconases attack the cellulose crystalline structure at random places, breaking the linear chains of glucose molecules to produce shorter chains. each break generates two new chain ends. exoglucanases act to these exposed ends of the chains and, working down the chains, liberate cellobiose and some glucose. finally, β-glucosidases completes the saccharification by breaking cellobiose and small cello-oligosaccharides into glucose molecules  <cit> .

cellulases are inducible enzymes which are synthesized by microorganisms during their growth on cellulosic materials. several microorganisms can produce cellulase enzyme including fungi, bacteria and actinomycetes. presently, the majority of the commercial and laboratory cellulases are achieved by fungi due to their high enzyme activity, but several factors suggest that bacteria may have excellent potential  <cit> . bacteria frequently have a higher growth rate than fungi allowing for higher rate of enzyme production. most significantly, they show affinity to be more heat stable and are easier for genetic purpose. various bacterial genera reported for cellulolytic activities include bacillus, clostridium, cellulomonas, rummminococcus, alteromonas, acetivibrio etc. among bacteria, bacillus sp. including b. brevis  <cit> , b. pumilus  <cit> , b. amyoliquefaciens dl- <dig>  <cit> , and bacillus subtilis yj <dig>  <cit>  bacillus sp.  <cit>  are well recognized cellulase production under submerged condition  <cit> . the present study was to isolate a potential organic-solvent-thermostable alkalophilic cellulase producing bacteria from natural ecosystem. afterthat, the cellulase enzyme was applied for purification and characterization of different parameters and purify enzyme was applied for the ethanol production and industrial exploitation which discuss in our next study.

RESULTS
isolation, screening and identification of thermotolerant cellulase producing bacterial cultures
fifty  bacterial strains were isolated from the soil samples on cmc agar plates. for checking the cellulolytic activity of the isolates on plates, plates were stained with congo-red and naoh solution. the zones of clearance by isolates reflect their extent of cellulolytic activity. those having clearance zone greater than > <dig>  cm were considered as significant. among fifty  bacterial isolates, only twenty nine  bacterial isolates exhibited good cellulase activity which was reassessed by loading their culture broth in the wells on cmc agar plates which stained with congo-red and naoh solution. the culture broth of good cellulase producers cleared more than > <dig>  cm zone within 4–5 h of incubation at 65°c, thereby indicating an extra-cellular nature of the cellulase. the isolate rg- <dig>  showing maximum clearance zone diameter was selected for further studies.

the efficient strain rg- <dig> was rod-shaped, gram-positive, aerobe and facultative, motile, with positive acetylmethylcarbinol, catalase and oxidase test. it grew over a wide range of ph , temperature , nacl concentration , and was able to hydrolyze gelatin, casein, starch, tween- <dig>  tween- <dig> and tween- <dig> and produce acid from glucose, xylose, mannitol and arabinose. it gives positive test for citrate utilization and nitrate reduction. the strain was halotolerant as it grew in the presence of  <dig> -12% nacl. on account of morphological and biochemical characteristics, it was identified as bacillus sp. by mtcc imtech, chandigarh . analysis of 16s rdna sequence revealed its  <dig> % homology with bacillus vallismortis strains, and was designated as bacillus vallismortis rg- <dig>  the 16s rdna sequence was submitted to gene bank  which doi is http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/jq <dig> . the strain rg- <dig> was in the same cluster of phylogenetic tree  with different strains of bacillus vallismortis. however, the 16s rdna sequence analysis indicates that it is a different and novel strain of bacillus vallismortis.figure  <dig>

bacillus
strains. in phylogenetic tree analysis, the strain was in the same cluster with different strains of bacillus and showed only  <dig> % homology to other bacillus vallismortis sp., so it could be stated that therefore it is different the from reported bacillus vallismortis. the phylogenetic tree was drawn by mega  <dig> software using neighbour-joining method and the significance of junctions was established using bootstrap method .



effect of agro-waste materials on cellulase production
the effect of agro-waste materials as carbon source on cell growth and cellulase production by bacillus vallismortis was investigated with sugarcane baggase, rice bran, wheat bran, rice husk and maize bran. from figure  <dig> it revealed that 2% sugarcane baggase  was found as most suitable substrate for cellulase production followed by rice husk  and rice bran , within 48 h. minimum cellulase production was reported from the wheat bran  and maize bran . similarly, sadhu et al.  <cit>  also reported that sugarcane baggase was the best carbon sources for cellulase production by bacillus sp. annamalai et al.  <cit>  and jo et al.  <cit>  were also reported that rice husk and rice bran were the best carbon source for cellulase production by bacillus halodurans cas  <dig> and bacillus amy-loliquefaciens dl- <dig>  respectively. the cellulosic waste materials such as rice bran, sugarcane baggase and rice hulls were used as best carbon sources for cellulase production due to their inducible nature  <cit> . the cellulase produced by the hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass by bacillus vallismortis could be valuable for bio-ethanol production, single cell protein and other industrially required chemicals.figure  <dig>

purification of extracellular cellulase
the crude enzyme extract was first concentrated by ammonium sulphate precipitation. maximum activity was observed in the fraction obtained by the addition of ammonium sulphate in 80% with protein content of  <dig>  mg ml− <dig>  this fraction had  <dig>  u mg− <dig> of specific activity with recovery of  <dig> % and with regard to purification it showed  <dig> -fold purification .table  <dig>

the active fraction of ammonium sulphate precipitation method was used for further purification by using ion exchange chromatography. sample  was loaded into the q-sepharose column pre-equilibrated with sodium phosphate buffer  and allowed to pass through the column. the un-bound fraction was collected and analyzed for cellulase activity and protein content. there was no cellulase activity in the un-bound fraction, while  <dig>  mg ml− <dig> of protein was estimated. the absence of enzyme in un-bound fraction suggested that total cellulase was bound to matrix. the bound enzyme was eluted by sodium phosphate buffer  having nacl with increasing concentration at gradient of  <dig>  m. 10 ml solution of each concentration of nacl was used to evade the bound enzyme. the cellulase activity was detected in the fraction released by the addition of  <dig>  m nacl anion-exchange chromatography of cellulase on column resulted in one prominent peak at the 21th fraction .figure  <dig>

the active fraction was applied on sephadex g- <dig> column. figure 3b shows the fractionation pattern of cellulase on sephadex g- <dig> column. one distinctive protein peak was appeared that overlapped with the cellulase activity. the purification process resulted in  <dig> -fold purification factor and a final recovery of  <dig> % of the enzyme with specific activity of  <dig>  u mg− <dig> . vijayaraghavan and vincent,  <cit>  reported  <dig> -fold purified cellulase with 24% recovery after gel chromatography for purification of cellulase from bacillus sp.

the purity of the enzyme was confirmed by the presence of a single band on sds-page and its molecular weight was approximately 80 kda , which was similar to alkalophilic bacillus sp. hsh- <dig> where it is 80 kda  <cit>  but different from bacillus sp. cellulase   <cit> .figure  <dig>

characterization of purified enzyme
effect of temperature on enzyme activity and stability
effect of temperature on purified enzyme activity was recorded over a broad range of temperature  with the optimal activity at 65°c and declined thereafter . the cellulase of strain rg- <dig> was completely stable in the broad temperature range of 30-90°c during 1 h incubation. however, with further increase in every 5°c temperature, there was a gradual decrease in enzyme stability ranging between 15-20% upto 105°c. the enzyme retained  <dig>   <dig> and 73% activity even after treatment at  <dig>   <dig> and 105°c, respectively . similarly, endoglucanase of bacillus licheniformis c <dig> was highly stable up to 100°c  <cit> . the cellulase of strain rg- <dig> is more thermostable than cellulase studied by several other researchers. most of workers have reported that thermostable cellulase stable up to 60-100°c but retained only ~50% activity at 100°c  <cit> . most other thermotolerant bacillus cellulase reported to so far, cellulases exhibited higher temperature optimum for activity and showed good thermal stability  <cit> . these are the properties considered to be very important for industrial cellulose saccharification. hence it is evident that the cellulase of strain rg- <dig> is more thermostable, and may be applied to several biotechnological and industrial purposes.figure  <dig> 
effect of temperature on enzyme activity and stability. for enzyme activity reaction mixture was incubated at different temperatures  and for stability enzyme was pre-incubated at respective temperatures for 1h and reaction was conducted as standard assay method.



effect of ph on enzyme activity and stability
the ph activity and stability of the purified cellulase was determined by measuring the enzyme activity at varying ph values ranging from 4– <dig> using different suitable buffers. it observed that maximum cellulase activity was established at ph  <dig> , however it was found to be most stable at ph  <dig>  . similar optimum enzyme activity was also found at ph  <dig>  in pseudomonas fluorescence  <cit> , bacillus amyoliquefaciens dl <dig>  <cit> . the relative activities at ph  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were determined to be  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 98%, respectively. at ph above  <dig> , the cellulase activity decreased rapidly. the cellulase from bacillus vallismortis rg- <dig> was stable in a range of ph  <dig> - <dig>  and at ph  <dig>  approximately 80% of its activity was retained . cellulases are generally stable over a wide range of ph from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
effect of ph on enzyme activity and stability. for enzyme activity the reaction was assayed at respective ph and for stability enzyme was pre-incubated with buffers  of different ph  at 65°c for  <dig> h and assayed by standard assay method.



effect of metal ions on enzyme activity and stability
bacillus vallismortis rg- <dig> cellulase was activated by 10 mm ca2+, mg+ <dig>  and na+ <dig> but inhibited by all other metal ions to a variable extent. results suggest that cellulase showed maximum relative activity  and stability  in the presence of calcium, magnesium and sodium ions. yoon et al.  <cit>  and bakare et al.  <cit>  had also reported that ca2+, mg+ <dig>  and na+ <dig> ions strongly stimulated cellulase activity. similarly wang et al.  <cit>  also reported that paenibacillus sp. strain b <dig> showed maximum enzyme activity in the presence of 1 mm ca2+. cellulase activity was slightly inhibited was by ni2+, cu2+ and zn2+ . cellulase was strongly inhibited in the presence of mn2+, and hg2+. similar results were reported for bacillus strain  <cit>  and bacillus amyoliquefaciens dl- <dig>  <cit> . it has been reported that the inhibition of cellulase activity by hg+ ion might be related to its binding with thiol groups, tryptophan residue, or the carboxyl group of amino acid residues in the enzyme  <cit> . the inhibition of cellulase by co2+, and cu2+ ions could be due to competition between the exogenous cations and the protein-associated cations, resulting in decreased metallo-enzyme activity.table  <dig>

enzyme activity was determined at 65°c in the presence of metal ions in the reaction mixture directly and for stability enzyme was pre-incubated with different metal ions at 65°c for 1 h and assayed as standard assay method. the enzyme activity without incubation with metal ions was taken as 100%. mean standard deviation for all the values is < ±  <dig> %.



effect of organic solvents on cellulase stability
in another approach, the effect of various organic solvents  on cellulase stability was also investigated for one week, and the results are depicted in table  <dig>  the cellulase of bacillus vallismortis rg- <dig> is extraordinarily stable in the presence of all organic solvents under study. it was observed that except benzene, propanol and ethanol, presence of other solvents enhanced the cellulase activity. after incubation with n-dodecane, n-decane, xylene, iso-octane, toluene, n-haxane, n-butanol, acetone, methanol, and cyclohexane the cellulase activity increased to  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and 133% , respectively. the presence of benzene, ethanol and propanol marginally reduced the cellulase with residual activities of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively . annamalai et al.  <cit>  also reported an organic solvent stable alkaline cellulase of bacillus halodurans cas  <dig> strain rand with enhanced activity in the presence of organic solvents . zaks and klibanov,  <cit>  suggested that stimulation of enzyme activity by organic solvents might be due to the residues of carried-over non-polar hydrophobic solvent providing an interface, thereby keeping the enzyme in an open conformation which resulting stimulated activation. it is therefore; evident from our study that cellulase of bacillus vallismortis rg- <dig> is remarkably stable in the presence of broad range hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic organic solvents employed in this study.table  <dig>

effect of inhibitors on enzyme stability
when the bacillus vallismortis rg- <dig> cellulase enzyme was incubated with edta, iodo-acetic acid , p-chloromercuribenzoate , dithiothreitol , urea and β-mercaptoethanol, the enzyme activity was retained at 110%, 70%, 50%, 134%, 114%, and 167% of the original activity at 10 mm . similarly, yin et al.  <cit>  reported that bacillus subtilis yj <dig> retained full activity in the presence of 10 mm edta and β-mercaptoethanol, while wang et al.  <cit>  reported that cellulase of paenibacillus sp. showed  <dig> and 29% activity with 10 mm. iaa and pcmb inhibits cellulase activity because they can bind with the sh group with different degree interaction and subsequently inhibit the activity. however, the β-mercaptoethanol and dtt can reduce the disulfide bonds and re-nature their activity, if the oxidation or aggregation of these enzyme proteins occurs during purification and storage. these phenomenons suggested that the active site of the enzyme contains -sh group  <cit> .table  <dig>

effect of surfactant, detergent and oxidizing agents on enzyme stability
in order to have applications in detergent industries, cellulase must be stable to various detergent ingredients, such as surfactants. as shown in table  <dig> the enzyme was appreciably stable in the presence of non-ionic surfactants like tween- <dig>  tween- <dig>  tween- <dig> and tritone- <dig> and detergent sds. however, these compounds slightly inhibited the cellulase activity with  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> % of residual activity at concentration  <dig> % . though, cellulase from a halotolerant isolate, bacillus sp. l <dig> retained 91% activity towards triton x- <dig>  tween- <dig>  and tween- <dig> and lost about  <dig> % activity in the presence of sds  <cit> . yin et al.  <cit>  reported that, a highly thermo-stable and alkaline cellulase enzyme, there was 95% stability after 1 h incubation with sds . in another study, sadhu et al.  <cit>  and wang et al.  <cit>  have reported that sds and tween- <dig> moderately inhibited cellulase activity 59-71% and 50-59%, respectively. thus from the above study it clear that cellulase of bacillus vallismortis rg- <dig> highly stable with 1% sds . this resistance, which is essential requirements, suggests that the enzyme may be used as an effective additive in detergents.table  <dig>

enzyme was pre-incubated with different surfactants, commercial detergents and oxidizing agents at 65°c for 1 h and assayed as standard assay method. the enzyme activity without incubation with surfactants, commercial detergents and oxidizing agents was taken as 100%. mean standard deviation for all the values is < ±  <dig> %.



the cellulase was substantially stable with commercial detergents at lower concentration . however, higher concentration  led to decrease the enzyme activity. the enzyme showed maximum stability in the presence of ariel, having residual activity of 89% after incubation at 65°c for 1 h . the enzyme had 80%,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % residual activities in the presence of surf excel, tide, fena and henko, respectively under similar condition . similarly annamalai et al.  <cit>  reported that purified cellulase from b. halodurans cas  <dig> retained its activity in the presence of some commercial detergents such as rin , ariel , henko  and tide . sadhu et al.  <cit>  also reported 57-72% residual activity with cellulase from bacillus strain in the presence of commercial detergents. similar results are reported from thermonospora sp. with different commercial detergent  <cit> .

among the oxidizing agents tested the cellulase activity enhanced in presence of sodium hypochlorite and h2o <dig> with residual activities  <dig>  and  <dig> % at concentration  <dig> %, whereas, higher concentrations  decreased the stability except sodium hypochlorite  . likewise, wang et al.  <cit>  also reported that lipase from b. cepacia was highly stable in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite and sodium perborate after 1 h. the stability profile of the cellulase in the presence of detergents and oxidizing agents prove its potential application in the detergent formulations as these agents are the active components of house hold detergents.

CONCLUSIONS
it is the first instance when a thermo-tolerant cellulase being reported from a thermo-tolerant solvent tolerant bacillus vallismortis rg- <dig> isolate. the strain is unique with respect to increased cellulase activity in the presence of various solvents of greater hydrophobicity . the cellulase activity in broad ph and temperature range of  <dig> - <dig>  and 30-105°c clearly indicate the thermo-alkaline nature of this enzyme. considering its stability under high temperature as well as mild alkaline condition, cellulase may be exploited for industrial usage.
