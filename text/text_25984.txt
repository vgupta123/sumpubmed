BACKGROUND
the cell wall polymer callose  is normally synthesized at specific developmental events, like in the cell plate  <cit>  and in pollen tube walls  <cit> . callose is also deposited at plasmodesmata  <cit>  and at sieve plates  <cit>  to limit intercellular transport, often as a response to developmental cues or environmental signals, e.g., wounding and pathogen attack  <cit> . callose deposition reinforces the cell wall at the site of the attack  <cit> , but callose can also be found at plasmodesmata in neighboring non-infected cells to limit spread of a fungal infection in resistant cultivars  <cit> . exposure to aluminum also induces callose production  <cit>  sometimes to occlude plasmodesmata  <cit> .

genes encoding callose synthases   <cit>  have now been identified in several plant species. in a. thaliana as much as  <dig> callose synthase genes have been identified  <cit> . biochemical studies have indicated that at least some gsl genes can produce proteins capable of synthesizing callose  <cit> .

callose synthases use udp-glucose as glucose donor to the growing polymer chain  <cit>  similar to cellulose synthases  although callose production appears to dominate in most in vitro experiments  <cit> . it was earlier believed that the two polymers were produced by one enzyme, which switched to callose synthesis in vivo upon wounding or during extraction to allow enzyme activity determinations  <cit> . the binding site for udp-glucose for callose synthase  is on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, and is thus inaccessible to direct assays in intact cells. to overcome this permeability barrier, detergents have been added to cells or isolated plant plasma membranes. this may, however, also create problems since the functional units are membrane-bound protein complexes  <cit>  which could be sensitive to changes in their membrane environment like partial delipidation of the enzymes and separation of complexes. for example, the detergent triton x- <dig> severely inhibited callose synthase activity in plasma membranes from oat root and cauliflower inflorescences  <cit> .

despite such problems, callose as well as cellulose synthesis have successfully been monitored with isolated proteins after solubilization of microsomal membranes with detergents e.g., digitonin, brij  <dig>  chaps or taurocholate  <cit> . the use of sucrose rather than udp-glucose as substrate, led to less callose and more cellulose formation. here, sucrose was probably metabolized by sucrose synthase to yield udp-glucose  <cit> . the assay conditions for the two activities differ, e.g., mg2+ ions favor cellulose synthesis, whereas callose synthesis depended on the presence of ca2+  <cit> .

in the cell, microtubules control the deposition of cellulose by guiding the movement of the cellulose synthases in the plasma membrane  <cit> . in contrast to cellulose, callose is usually relatively amorphous. however, using plasma membrane sheets from tobacco by- <dig> protoplasts isolated in the presence of taxol to stabilize microtubules, the callose was deposited in oriented microfibrils  <cit> . if the preparation was done in the presence of propyzamide  instead of taxol, the product was deposited in diffusely distributed masses, suggesting that microtubules are needed to orient callose deposition at least with protoplasts  <cit> . there are also indications that microtubules affect callose production in the cell plate, at least indirectly. drp1a, a phragmoplastin-like protein, was observed to associate with golgi-derived vesicles transported along microtubules to the growing cell plate  <cit> , and phragmoplastins interact with udp glycosyl transferase, which probably is part of the cell plate callose synthase complex  <cit> . deposition of callose in the cell plate was reported to be tightly linked to the depolymerization of microtubules  <cit> .

microtubules are sensitive to changes in the cellular environment as part of their dynamic function. therefore, the in vitro conditions previously used to study callose synthesis probably deviate from in vivo conditions with respect to cytoskeleton associations. the microtubule-plasma membrane-cell wall continuum is broken when the plasma membrane is solubilized. therefore, alternative ways to investigate callose synthesis, where the interior of the cell is minimally disrupted and the cell wall is still present, are highly needed as complements to detergent solubilization. one possibility is to use the channel-forming molecule alamethicin. this is a  <dig> amino acid amphiphilic polypeptide from the fungus trichoderma viride  <cit> , which can be used to permeabilize biological membranes  <cit> . it inserts into membranes when applied to the positively charged side, and forms low-specificity ion channels with <dig> Å pore size  <cit> . these pores allow the passage of small charged molecules like atp and nadh while being impermeable to macromolecules like folded proteins  <cit> . this stands in contrast to the holes formed by digitonin through which proteins can pass  <cit> . alamethicin is gentle regarding side effects on membrane enzyme systems , whereas a detergent like digitonin will bind hydrophobic surfaces and molecules in membranes that it can permeabilize. in tobacco bright yellow  <dig>  suspension cells, alamethicin permeabilized the plasma membrane and the inner mitochondrial membrane but not the tonoplast, allowing direct activity measurement of glycolytic and mitochondrial enzymes. consistently, cells treated with alamethicin were depleted in metabolites within  <dig> min, leading to a sharp decrease in respiration. when removing alamethicin from treated cells, a large subset of cells were still viable and regained the ability to divide  <cit> .

here we have explored the potential use of alamethicin for permeabilization of a. thaliana columbia  and tobacco by- <dig> cells to measure synthesis of cell wall polymers. in the presence of an intact cell wall, alamethicin permeabilized col- <dig> plasma membrane, the inner mitochondrial membrane and the plastid envelope in virtually all cells in the treated population. this in situ system allowed measurement of callose synthesis, and thus describing its spatial distribution in the cells and the regulation of callose synthesis by the polymerization state of tubulin. this connection was strengthened by the observation that tubulin and callose synthase co-migrated as a protein complex during two dimensional blue native sds-page.

RESULTS
alamethicin permeabilization of col- <dig> and by- <dig> cells
it was previously shown that alamethicin could be used to permeabilize by- <dig> cells  <cit> . to enable the use of a. thaliana cells in addition to by- <dig> and to investigate the regulation of callose synthesis, we wished to establish if col- <dig> suspension cultured cells were similarly permeabilized by alamethicin. a decrease in respiration  by metabolite depletion was found also with col- <dig>  and the time required to abolish respiration was around  <dig> min for both by- <dig> and col- <dig> cells . treatment of col- <dig> cells with alamethicin for  <dig> min also allowed the membrane-impermeable nucleic acid stain yo-pro to mark nuclei and organelles with uniform staining of the whole cell population . a virtually identical staining was produced by the membrane-impermeable nucleic acid stain propidium iodide, as observed by perfectly overlapping double staining .

the apparent activities of nad-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase , and nad-isocitrate dehydrogenase , increased in col- <dig> cells treated with increasing concentrations of alamethicin, indicating permeabilization of the plasma membrane and the inner mitochondrial membrane . the maximum activity was approached using between  <dig> and  <dig> μg ml- <dig> alamethicin, and more than 60% of maximum activity was reached already using  <dig> μg ml- <dig> of alamethicin for cytosolic enzymes. the activities of gapdh, pepc and nad-idh in alamethicin permeabilized cells were 90–100% of the activities measured after solubilizing with  <dig> %  triton x- <dig> .

the activities of cytosolic and plastidic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase  also increased with increased alamethicin, but not identically. cytosolic g6pdh activity was detected at lower alamethicin concentrations compared to that of the plastidic form . this difference was significant when  <dig> or  <dig> μg ml- <dig> of alamethicin was used . the maximum activity measured for the plastidic g6pdh was higher than that of the cytosolic g6pdh in alamethicin-permeabilized cells . triton x- <dig>  severely inhibited the plastidic enzyme, resulting in activities being  <dig> ± 10% of those obtained after alamethicin permeabilization. in contrast, no inhibitory effect by triton x- <dig> was found for the cytosolic enzyme. the results thus show that alamethicin homogenously permeabilizes a population of col- <dig> cells with respect to plasma membrane, mitochondria and plastids.

characterization of callose synthesis in alamethicin-permeabilized cells
having seen that col- <dig> cells were efficiently permeabilized by alamethicin in a manner similar to what was previously reported  <cit> , we next wanted to investigate whether this system could be used to monitor the plasma membrane-bound enzyme callose synthase in situ. digitonin was chosen for comparison when following udp-glucose incorporation, since this agent has been used in many investigations. the activity measured  using alamethicin  was generally of similar magnitude or higher than that measured using digitonin. the shape of the alamethicin curve was sigmoid for udp-glucose incorporation  as for the metabolic enzymes , suggesting a cooperativity between the alamethicin molecules during channel formation. in contrast, the digitonin curve was hyperbolic in the lower concentration range, while at higher digitonin concentrations the activity was severely inhibited .

to further characterize udp-glucose incorporation in alamethicin-permeabilized col- <dig> cells we varied the concentrations of ca2+ and mg2+ in the assay. the activity was strongly stimulated by ca2+. substituting the ca2+ with mg2+ abolished the activity. the highest activity was obtained after addition of both  <dig> mm ca2+ and  <dig> mm mg2+ . no effect was obtained when the cells were preincubated with the cellulose synthase inhibitor isoxaben . the lack of inhibition by isoxaben together with the stimulation by ca2+ addition indicate that callose synthase activity indeed was measured  <cit> .

it was observed that ethanol negatively affected the measured callose synthase activity. some ethanol  was always present in the assay as solvent for alamethicin). with increasing concentration, ethanol substantially decreased the activity in col- <dig> and by- <dig> cells . ethanol inhibition of callose synthesis was also observed in digitonin-permeabilized col- <dig> cells , showing that the inhibition was not due to effects on alamethicin channel formation.

callose synthase and microtubules in alamethicin permeabilized cells
to investigate the role of the cytoskeleton on callose synthesis, cells were preincubated with  <dig> μm oryzalin for  <dig> h to inhibit microtubule polymerization prior to alamethicin permeabilization and assay. treated cells  showed significantly lower callose synthase activity compared to control  cells . omitting oryzalin during permeabilization and assay gave similar inhibition  showing that oryzalin did not interfere with the assay. in contrast to the oryzalin effect, pretreatment with  <dig> μm cytochalasin, which inhibits actin polymerization, lead to somewhat increased activity . a slightly but not significantly lower value  was seen after incubation with  <dig> μm taxol, known to stabilize microtubules. the lowered activity measured after preincubation with oryzalin suggested that the presence of polymerized tubulin was important for maximum callose synthesis in both col- <dig> and by- <dig> cells.

immunofluorescence studies of control  col- <dig> cells, using β-tubulin antibodies, showed the presence of parallel microtubules around the cell periphery . in oryzalin-treated cells, microtubules were no longer present and β-tubulin was distributed in the cytosol, probably as unpolymerized subunits . not surprisingly, a cellular collapse was observed after triton x- <dig> addition to living cells . the cells also appeared damaged after digitonin treatment. the microtubule organization in parallel strands seen in the control  was lost with digitonin . at the same time, the pattern with digitonin was strongly deviant from the distribution of depolymerized tubulin seen after oryzalin treatment . the polymeric tubulin remaining after digitonin treatment lacked orientation, probably reflecting a partial depolymerization taking place . similarly, after addition of alamethicin , polymeric tubulin was seen reorganized into thicker and more netlike structures, which were somewhat punctate. inclusion of mg2+ during alamethicin permeabilization resulted in a similar pattern . tubulin polymerization by itself was not affected by the presence of the peptide, as seen by light scattering with purified tubulin .

to find out if the pretreatment with oryzalin also affected callose synthesis qualitatively, alamethicin-permeabilized by- <dig> cells were stained with aniline blue. callose was deposited in spots, sometimes in rows, on outer walls  as well as in larger quantity at cell-cell connections . hardly any callose was produced if egta was present in the assay to chelate ca2+ . unpermeabilized cells showed no staining by- <dig> cells pretreated with oryzalin showed a similar dual distribution of callose deposition. due to the heterogeneity of the cell population with regard to callose deposition it was not possible to quantify callose production. however, visual inspection indicated a generally lower staining in oryzalin treated cells . a similar pattern of callose deposition was also observed in permeabilized col- <dig> cells .

native gel electrophoresis of isolated plasma membranes
the data presented above indicate an interaction between callose synthase and microtubules/tubulin that remained after alamethicin permeabilization. to further test this possible interaction, we used blue native sds-page to separate plasma membrane protein complexes isolated from untreated by- <dig> cells, as was successfully done earlier with spinach leaf plasma membranes  <cit> . in by- <dig> cells, callose synthase appeared in two different protein complexes with masses of approximately  <dig> kda and at  <dig> kda, each comigrating with tubulin, that was more abundant at the same masses . the comigration suggests that callose synthase and tubulin are part of the same complexes through a relatively strong physical interaction, sufficient for the binding to remain during isolation and gel analysis. a mass of around  <dig> kda for the callose synthase complex was also found with spinach leaf plasma membranes  <cit> . sucrose synthase, on the other hand, was not here associated with callose synthase but found in a separate complex, with a molecular mass between  <dig> and  <dig> kda , consistent with the enzyme being a tetramer in vivo  <cit> .

discussion
much information on the synthesis of callose has been obtained in relatively dilute in vitro assays using isolated enzymes or membrane fractions. however, in the cell most processes are characterized by tightly controlled, more or less transient, protein interactions that take place in a crowded and compartmentalized environment. there has therefore been a need for good protocols for in situ investigations to further approach cellular conditions. in earlier experiments we used alamethicin permeabilization of tobacco by- <dig> cells to measure activities of enzymes of the primary metabolism in the cytosol and in mitochondria  <cit> . we here show that alamethicin efficiently and homogeneously permeabilizes a. thaliana col- <dig> cell populations, and that also plastids are permeabilized, albeit at somewhat higher concentrations than needed for the plasma membrane. the permeabilization by alamethicin of the inner envelope membrane shown here, agrees with what can be predicted from membrane potential orientations  <cit> . similarly, predictions that the tonoplast should be permeabilization-resistant have been experimentally verified  <cit> . we have used this system for studies on the regulation of plasma membrane-bound callose synthesis.

callose in the cell wall is synthesized by plasma membrane-bound multiprotein complexes and products are most often deposited in a preexisting wall. thus, to learn about how these processes are regulated, it is desirable to have the plasma membrane-cell wall continuum intact. we here show that callose synthase activity could be determined in col- <dig> and by- <dig> cells permeabilized with alamethicin as well as with digitonin but that the activities using alamethicin were higher. digitonin inhibited callose synthesis especially at higher concentrations, and maximum activation was probably never reached . the inactivation was likely due to digitonin producing large holes  <cit>  that should deteriorate membranes, and possibly by binding hydrophobic surfaces of proteins. the digitonin concentrations used in earlier studies ranged from  <dig> %  <cit>  to 1%  <cit> , i.e. in the range where the callose synthase in our study changes from being activated to severely inhibited . in contrast, alamethicin concentrations up to  <dig> μg ml- <dig> did not inhibit callose synthase activity . the small size of the alamethicin pore  compared to the less defined large holes produced by digitonin , will also allow a better maintenance of compartment separation, since folded proteins can pass through membranes after permeabilization with digitonin, but not alamethicin  <cit> . for example,  <dig> μm digitonin  was enough to deplete rat hepatocytes of cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase  <cit> .

we noted a sharp decrease of callose synthase activity upon addition of ethanol. ethanol is synthesized naturally during anoxia  <cit>  and one might expect that an increased need for glycolytic breakdown of sucrose to satisfy cell energy demands would decrease the shuttling of udp-glucose towards cell wall synthesis. during anoxia,  <dig> to  <dig> μmol g- <dig>  ethanol have been observed  <cit> , though being highly volatile, ethanol determinations in tissues should be expected to be underestimations  <cit> . the 1% ethanol concentration needed to achieve strong callose synthase inhibition  corresponds to  <dig> μmol g- <dig> . therefore, some inhibition could likely be present even at physiological concentrations of ethanol, especially if ethanol diffusion out of anoxic cells would be partially limited. furthermore, the callose synthase assay employed here could not be performed in the complete absence of ethanol since it was used as solvent for alamethicin . therefore, the potential inhibitory effect of low concentrations of ethanol may have been underestimated.

aniline blue staining indicated that callose was deposited in spots over the cell surface, especially in walls connecting cells, but also in outer walls . staining was found only after alamethicin permeabilization and addition of ca2+ and udp-glucose , consistent with the conditions in the in vitro incorporation assay and the requirements for callose synthesis in isolated by- <dig> phragmoplasts  <cit> . the spot-like callose deposits in outer walls resemble structures seen earlier in aluminium-exposed cell suspensions of tobacco  <cit>  as well as in a. thaliana cell suspensions  <cit> . based on the colocalisation of callose and the er protein calreticulin in isolated cell walls, the spots were suggested to be half-plasmodesmata  <cit>  which, however, must be nonfunctional with respect to transport. in regenerating solanum nigrum protoplasts, discontinuous half-plasmodesmata were initially formed on the outer walls at regions of er-entrapment, which disappeared as the wall was reformed, unless they were fused with half-plasmodesmata of other cells  <cit> . in filamentous cell suspensions of a. thaliana, a wound-like response was induced by arabinogalactan-binding yariv phenylglucosides, including the formation of plug-like callose deposition on outer walls  <cit> . however, due to low magnification, the possible presence of also punctate callose staining at outer walls cannot be excluded. we found that generally less callose was deposited both at cell-cell and outer walls after incubation with oryzalin , i.e., the lowered activity was not an indirect consequence from effects of microtubule disruption on mitosis and cytokinesis.

using immunofluorescence detection of tubulin, we could observe that the microtubules had become reorganized after alamethicin permeabilization, but detected tubulin was still polymeric. this suggests that the microtubules were partially, but far from fully depolymerized. callose synthase activity was lower in cells preincubated with oryzalin prior to assay  for both col- <dig> and by- <dig> cells. the tubulin reorganization induced by permeabilization, and associated ca2+ influx, may thus reflect a regulatory interaction between callose synthase and a tubulin network in the process of being restructured. taken together the results suggest that the native plasma membrane protein complexes containing callose synthase and tubulin seen using blue native sds-page , reflected functional units in situ. furthermore, their interaction must be relatively strong since it remained during native gel electrophoresis . in contrast, sucrose synthase which has been hypothesized also to interact with callose synthase  <cit>  to deliver substrate for the enzymatic reaction, was not found to be associated with the complex. this strong interaction between callose synthase and tubulin is in line with that a pool of plasma membrane-bound tubulin showed hydrophobic properties suggesting a tight interaction with the membrane  <cit> . the improved maintenance of the cytoskeleton-enzyme continuum allowed by alamethicin  may be useful also for investigating cytosolic carbohydrate metabolism enzymes, whose activity is affected by presence of cytoskeletal proteins  <cit> 

in the work presented here, the effect of oryzalin on callose synthesis was quantitative rather than qualitative. this is opposite to findings reported earlier on the synthesis of glucan  microfibrils using membrane sheets isolated from by- <dig> protoplasts  <cit> . in those experiments, the total production of glucan polymers was independent on the presence of microtubules. however, microtubules were needed to control the orientation of the glucan microfibrils formed, i.e., ordered fibrils were obtained if the microtubules were stabilized with taxol but not when these were destabilized by propyzamide. the contrasting results probably reflect the different situations in a cell  compared to a protoplast  <cit>  during the deposition of cell wall material.

the punctate distribution of the polymeric tubulin seen in alamethicin-permeabilized cells  resembles that of the callose deposits seen using aniline blue staining . it is therefore possible that the callose deposits coincide with the areas where the original microtubules were in contact with the plasma membrane. that such contacts involve plasmodesmata have been indicated in several previous reports. in n. benthamiana leaves infected with tobacco mosaic virus, the movement protein colocalized with er and was targeted to punctate sites related to plasmodesmata in a microtubule-dependent manner  <cit> . also, the microtubule-bundling protein atmap65- <dig> colocalized with plasmodesmata in newly formed cell walls, suggesting that it is an integral part of the plasmodesmal complex  <cit> . other cytoskeletal elements  may also be part of the machinery regulating intercellular trafficking  <cit> .

it is intriguing that a general permeabilization by a peptide agent induces a spatially distinct response, i.e. callose synthesis located at specific points. after mechanical isolation of bundle sheath cells of c <dig> grasses, non-selective channels were formed with an exclusion limit of ca  <dig> kda, consistent with open half-plasmodesmata  <cit> . in the plant, separation of cells occurs as a natural stage of development, especially in tissues with large intercellulars, and transiently open half-plasmodesmata are inevitably formed. our results therefore indicate that the alamethicin-induced permeabilization mimics the signal for the induction of a defense response against plasmodesmal leakage. the response eventually leads to the closing of plasmodesmata, assisted by callose formation being induced by the elevated ca2+. this plasmodesmal closing could be important for cell survival after physical separation of previously connected cells but also as a response to other lethal challenges to neighboring cells. we have previously observed that by- <dig> cells can be recultivated after alamethicin permeabilization, i.e., plant cells can survive a substantial permeabilization  <cit> . it must likewise be assumed that cells in a tissue can survive the temporary permeabilization consequential to the formation of half-plasmodesmata upon separation of cells. taken together, our results opens up new perspectives regarding how plant cells respond to the temporary permeabilizations that are inevitable during development, e.g., during the schizogenic formation of intercellular spaces.

CONCLUSIONS
the channel-forming peptide alamethicin permeabilized plasma membrane, mitochondria and plastids in cultured cells of arabidopsis and tobacco. this allowed in situ activity analysis of callose synthase, a complex plasma membrane-located enzyme, under conditions where the continuous interactions cell wall -plasma membrane -cytoskeletal macromolecules remained. in contrast, callose synthase in these cells was severely inhibited by digitonin, another often used permeabilization agent. blue native gel electrophoresis of isolated plasma membranes indicated that callose synthase and tubulin were part of the same protein complex. callose synthase activity was consistently inhibited in cells pretreated by oryzalin to destabilize the microtubules. however, irrespective of oryzalin pretreatment, callose was deposited in a punctate manner at walls between cells and at outer walls. the pattern of this deposition resembled half-plasmodesmata. the results thus suggest that alamethicin permeabilization induces a defense response to a transient permeabilization taking place during the natural physical separation of cells.
