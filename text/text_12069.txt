BACKGROUND
the combination of recent advances in imaging technologies and development of luciferase-based bioluminescent reporter strains provide a sensitive and simple non-invasive detection method  for the study of diverse biological processes, as well as efficacy of therapeutic interventions, in live animal models of human and animal disease  <cit> . in vivo bioluminescence can be employed to determine initial locations of infections and spatial migration of bioluminescently labeled pathogens over a period of several days to weeks. this technology has been applied to study chronic soft-tissue pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus biofilm infections  <cit> , p. aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis urinary tract infections  <cit> , as well as catheter-associated endovascular infections  <cit> , and others  <cit> . biophotonic imaging also allows assessments of the in vivo efficacy of antibiotic therapy in real time in living animals  <cit> . some caveats of biophotonic imaging are: 1) luciferase-catalyzed reactions require energy , oxygen and a specific fatty acid substrate  <cit>  and therefore allow the detection of only live, metabolically active cells. because of the oxygen requirement of luciferases, bacterial cells expressing luciferase in strictly anaerobic environments such as the gut were in some instances found to be non-luminescent  <cit> . however, such instances are rare and bioluminescence can be detected in harvested organs exposed to oxygen  <cit> . furthermore, other authors reported luciferase expression in anaerobic bacteria, e.g. bifidobacterium breve grown in vitro and in vivo  <cit> , and luciferase-tagged bacteria in anaerobic environments such as tumors  <cit> ; 2) to ensure stable maintenance during the course of infections in animals, the bioluminescent reporter must be integrated into the chromosome of the respective bacteria. replicating plasmids carrying the lux operon have been evaluated for bioimaging studies, but their use is limited because they only allow short-term  infections to be accurately monitored in vivo in animals due to plasmid loss or dilution in the absence of antibiotic selection  <cit> . chromosomal integration of plasmids via homologous recombination has been employed for construction of bioluminescent strains but the resulting strains are potentially unstable in the absence of antibiotic selection  <cit> . initially, stable chromosomal integration was achieved by random transposition of a mini-tn5-luxcdabe element  <cit>  or another suitable transposon carrying the lux operon  <cit> , followed by antibiotic resistance selection and screening for cells exhibiting strong expression of luciferase activity from a chromosomal promoter. consequences of employing random transposition are: 1) need for investment of considerable efforts to determine transposon insertion sites and fitness of the mutant bacteria; 2) integrated transposons cannot easily be recovered or transferred between different mutant backgrounds for meaningful comparative analyses because most bacteria lack efficient chromosomal gene transfer procedures, except for those for which transducing phages are available or that are naturally transformable  <cit> ; and 3) lack of a universal promoter for lux gene expression across either gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria necessitates development of new bioluminescent strains for each bacterial species to be studied with this technology.

in some bacteria the first two issues have been largely addressed and can be circumvented by use of site-specific insertion elements  <cit> . however, construction of bioluminescent reporter strains is still one of the limiting factors of biophotonic imaging. the major unmet need is lack of suitable promoters for luciferase expression in different bacteria. in gram-positive bacteria development of synthetic promoters for luciferase gene expression have been successful in some cases  <cit> . however, previous attempts by our laboratory to engineer synthetic promoters based on, for example, the escherichia coli lac operon-trp operon hybrid promoter ptac  <cit>  for use in non-enteric bacteria were largely unsuccessful mostly because of the instability of many of the synthetic promoters. we have successfully used the p <dig> integron promoter  <cit>  for driving luciferase gene expression in burkholderia species  <cit>  indicating that this promoter may be useful for high-level constitutive gene expression in other non-enteric bacteria.

the purpose of this study was to create a simple to use, yet highly versatile series of plasmids for use in gram-negative bacteria that facilitate promoter discovery and capture, as well as the creation of stable, bioluminescent strains of bacteria. to do this, we combined several features of transposons tn <dig>  <cit>  and tn <dig>  <cit> .

tn <dig> transposes randomly in bacteria. minimal requirements for transposition are a transposase that can be provided in trans, mosaic ends  and an antibiotic resistance selection marker  <cit> . a mini-tn <dig> transposon contains the 19 bp mes flanking the selection marker and is located on a delivery plasmid that contains the transposase gene tnpa outside of the mini-tn <dig> element  <cit> . cargo cloned on the mini-tn <dig> can be randomly transposed into bacterial chromosomes. in contrast to tn <dig>  tn <dig> transposes site-specifically in gram-negative bacteria, notably to chromosomal atttn <dig> sites in the presence of the site-specific transposition pathway composed of tnsabcd  <cit> . most gram-negative bacteria contain only a single atttn <dig> site associated with the essential glms gene   <cit> . however, some contain multiple glms genes and thus multiple atttn <dig> sites  <cit> . in one instance, proteus mirabilis, one glms- and one non-glms-associated atttn <dig> site was documented  <cit> . minimal requirements for tn <dig> transposition are a transposase that can be provided in trans, tn <dig> left and right ends  and an antibiotic resistance selection marker  <cit> . cargo cloned on the mini-tn <dig> element can be site- and orientation-specifically transposed into bacterial chromosomes in the presence of a plasmid that transiently expresses the tn <dig> transposase subunits tnsabcd  <cit> .

in this study, we constructed and tested mini-tn5/7-lux elements with diverse selection markers that allow promoter identification by random tn5-mediated transposition into the chromosomes of diverse target bacteria and screening for cells exhibiting strong expression of luciferase activity from a chromosomal promoter. the promoters can then be captured by self-ligation of chromosomal dna fragments which creates a plasmid carrying a mini-tn <dig> element that serves as a template for promoter identification by dna sequencing, or by pcr amplification of promoter-containing fragments. in some instances, e.g. in the presence of short chromosomal dna inserts or when recombination-deficient recipient strains are available, the mini-tn7-lux elements can be transposed into other bacteria without further modification. alternatively, promoter-containing dna fragments can be subcloned into a series of accompanying mini-tn7-lux delivery vectors with diverse selection markers.

RESULTS
overview of the mini-tn5/7-lux promoter identification, capture, and mini-tn7-lux tagging procedures
the overall procedure involves promoter identification and capture   and, a unique aspect of the new procedure, methods for bacterial lux tagging by site-specific chromosomal insertion of promoter-lux fusions using mini-tn7-lux elements . promoter identification and capture comprises three steps. step  <dig> involves tn <dig> transposition into the chromosome of the bacterial host of interest. this is achieved by conjugal transfer of the mini-tn5/7-lux delivery plasmid, followed by selection of kmr or other antibiotic resistance markers and screening for light-emitting exconjugants. because the mini-tn5/7-lux delivery plasmid is non-replicative in the host and tn <dig> transposase is only transiently transcribed from the plasmid backbone, the resulting bioluminescent bacteria have the mini-tn5/7-lux element stably integrated such that the lux operon is transcribed from the promoter of the target gene containing the mini-tn5/7-lux insertion. this gene can either be a single transcriptional unit or part of an operon. to identify the mini-tn5/7-lux insertion site, genomic dna is digested with an enzyme that does not cleave within the transposed element . since mini-tn5/7-lux contains an orir6k and an antibiotic resistance selection marker, religation of the dna fragment containing the transposon results in a plasmid which can be recovered by transformation of a pir+e. coli host and selecting antibiotic resistant transformants . sequencing of plasmid dna with a luxc-specific primer  will reveal the transposon insertion site. tn <dig> transposition is not affected by the target bacterium’s recombination status because the mini-tn5/7-lux plasmid does not carry any chromosomal dna.figure  <dig>

elements. step  <dig> involves random tn <dig> transposition into the chromosome of the bacterial host of interest  after conjugal transfer of the mini-tn5/7-lux delivery plasmid. this plasmid also contains the tn <dig> transposase encoding tnpa gene. tnpa acts on the tn <dig> mosaic ends , which results in random mini-tn5/7-lux transposition into the bacterial chromosome, including insertion in a gene where the photorhabdus luminescens luxcdabe operon is transcribed from the gene’s promoter . the mini-tn <dig> element, i.e. sequences flanked by the tn <dig> left  and right  ends, located on the mini-tn5/7-lux delivery plasmid does not transpose in this step because the delivery plasmid does not encode tn <dig> transposase. mini-tn5/7-lux chromosomal insertion is stable because the chromosomally-integrated elements do neither encode tn <dig> nor tn <dig> transposase. in step  <dig>  chromosomal dna of in this example kanamycin resistance  and light-emitting transformants is isolated and digested with a restriction enzyme  that does not cleave within the transposed element. in step  <dig>  chromosomal dna fragments are religated and a plasmid containing the r6k origin of replication  and origin of conjugal transfer  is recovered by transformation of a pir

methods for site-specific insertion of promoter-

fusions using mini-tn

elements. chromosomal integration of promoter-lux fusions can be achieved in two ways.  the plasmid recovered in step  <dig> of the promoter identification and capture procedure illustrated in figure  <dig> is a functional mini-tn <dig> delivery plasmid which in some instances  may be used to directly transpose site-specifically into the glms gene-associated tn <dig> attachment site  in the chromosome of the bacterium under study to obtain luminescent derivatives. site-specific mini-tn7-lux insertion is achieved by co-transfer of the mini-tn7-lux delivery plasmid and a helper plasmid that encodes the site-specific tnsabcd transposition pathway, which acts on the tn <dig> left  and right  ends. both plasmids contain the origin of transfer  for conjugal transfer into the target bacterium and the conditional r6k origin of replication , which limits their replication to e. coli hosts expressing the plasmid r6k π protein. the mini-tn <dig> element  contained on the mini-tn7-lux delivery plasmid does not transpose because the delivery plasmid does not encode tn <dig> transposase.  alternatively, the promoter identified by sequencing the mini-tn5/7-lux-chromosomal junction sequences located on the plasmid rescued in step  <dig> of the procedure illustrated in figure  <dig> can be cloned into other mini-tn7-lux elements. these are then transposed into the target bacterium for obtaining bioluminescent bacteria by site-specific mini-tn7-lux transposition as described above. in both scenarios, a and b, the kmr selection marker contained on the chromosomally integrated mini-tn7-lux elements is flanked by flp recombinase target  sites for optional marker excision with saccharomyces cerevisiae flp recombinase. the ampicillin resistance  marker is used for selection and maintenance of the helper plasmid in e. coli.



the captured promoter transcribing the lux gene operon can be used to derive bioluminescent bacteria by tagging with mini-tn7-lux elements in two ways. the choice of method is in part affected by the target bacterium’s recombination status and the size of promoter-containing dna fragment. first, the mini-tn5/7-lux delivery plasmid used for promoter identification and capture is designed such that the plasmid recovered in step  <dig> of the promoter identification and capture procedure illustrated in figure  <dig> is a functional mini-tn <dig> delivery plasmid which in some instances  may be used to directly transpose site-specifically into the glms gene-associated tn <dig> attachment site  in the chromosome of the bacterium under study to obtain luminescent derivatives. for site-specific transposition, mini-tn <dig> elements require the tn <dig> transposase complex, which is encoded by a helper plasmid containing the tnsabcd genes specifying the site-specific tn <dig> transposition pathway. second, the plasmid recovered in step  <dig> of the promoter identification and capture procedure illustrated in figure  <dig> may be used as a source for promoter-containing dna fragments that can be pcr amplified, cloned into other mini-tn7-lux elements, and be employed for obtaining bioluminescent bacteria after site-specific mini-tn7-lux transposition as described above. this procedure is advised when the plasmid obtained in the promoter recovery step contains larger  regions of promoter-containing chromosomal dna or when reca-deficient target strains are not available. in these instances, chromosomal integration via homologous recombination is favored over site-specific mini-tn <dig> integration. examples for both mini-tn7-lux tagging scenarios are presented below. direct tagging with a mini-tn7-lux element containing the captured promoter transcribing the lux operon is illustrated in a reca e. coli strain. a wild-type acinetobacter baumannii strain is presented as an example for a bacterium tagged with a mini-tn7-lux element where lux operon transcription is driven by a promoter which was identified during using mini-tn5/7-lux mediated identification and capture, and then subcloned in a mini-tn <dig> element harboring a promoter-less lux operon.

it should be reiterated at this point that, as noted above, most gram-negative bacteria contain only one chromosomal glms-associated atttn <dig> site  <cit>  with the exception of proteus mirabilis  <cit> . in contrast, the majority of burkholderia species examined to date contain multiple glms genes and thus multiple atttn <dig> sites, ranging from two sites in b. thailandensis  <cit>  and b. mallei  <cit>  to three sites in b. pseudomallei  <cit> . although insertions in these bacteria can occur at all sites, most insertions are usually at one, preferred atttn <dig> site. in b. mallei, analysis of  <dig> randomly selected insertions showed that 96% of the insertions were at the glms1-associated atttn <dig> site. by contrast, only 8% of the insertions were at the glms2-associated atttn <dig> site. only 4% of the transformants had insertions at both glms <dig> and glms <dig>  <cit> . in b. pseudomallei, >65% of observed insertions occur at the glms2-associated atttn <dig> site, but there is no obvious preference for either the glms1- or glms3-associated atttn <dig> sites. while double insertions in two separate atttn <dig> sites are fairly common , triple insertions are rarely observed  <cit> . presence of multiple atttn <dig> sites is not an impediment because sites of insertions can be readily differentiated by multiplex pcr. an example for insertion site analysis in b. pseudomallei is illustrated in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

tn5/7-lux-based promoter capture in e. coli dh5α
to assess the feasibility of the mini-tn5/7-lux procedure, we constructed the first member of the mini-tn5/7-lux family, ptn5/7-luxk <dig> . transposition of ptn5/7-luxk <dig> into dh5α after conjugal transfer and selection of kmr exconjugants produced approximately 1% brightly luminescent clones amongst the colonies that were examined for luminescence. a bright isolate  was chosen for further study. genomic dna was isolated, digested with ecori and self-ligated fragments were used to transform e. coli pir+ strain cc <dig>  <cit> . kmr transformants were screened for light emission and a plasmid containing the captured promoter region, ptn7dh51luxk <dig>  was isolated. the mini-tn5/7-lux insertion site was determined to be located in the rbsc gene, the third gene of the rbsdacbk operon required for the transport and initial steps of ribose metabolism  <cit>  . the mini-tn7-prbs-lux element contained on ptn7dh51luxk <dig> was transposed into the dh5α chromosome and mini-tn <dig> transposition was confirmed by pcr. since dh5α is a reca mutant strain all exconjugants examined contained the mini-tn7-prbs-lux element inserted at the atttn <dig> site instead of recombination-mediated insertion at the rbsdacbk locus. imaging showed that the resulting strain  emitted similar levels of light when compared to the original mini-tn5/7-lux transposition clone kvt <dig> . to ascertain that the rbsdacbk operon promoter  located in the 167 bp kup-rbsd intergenic region was responsible for lux operon transcription in strain kvt <dig> and kvt <dig>  the predicted rbs promoter region was pcr-amplified on a 182-bp fragment and directionally cloned upstream of the lux operon contained on ptn5/7luxk <dig> resulting in ptn7prbsluxk <dig>  transposition of the resulting mini-tn7-prbs-lux element into dh5α resulted in strain kvt <dig> which was more bioluminescent than kvt <dig> and kvt <dig> presumably because the rbs promoter was placed closer to the lux operon on the mini-tn7-prbs-lux element inserted in kvt <dig> .figure  <dig>

construction of next generation lux vectors
after successful testing in e. coli, we sought to expand the versatility of the mini-tn5/7-lux system for use in a broad-range of bacteria and by inclusion of other desirable properties such as incorporation of attb <dig> and attb <dig> sites flanking the lux operon to facilitate its exchange for other reporter genes such as gfp via gateway technology  <cit> . this resulted in a family of versatile plasmids with diverse selection markers  most of which can be excised in vivo using flp recombinase, a lux operon with or without exchangeable promoters and the tn <dig> transposase tnpa gene with flanking mes either transcribed from its own promoter or the constitutive s <dig> gene promoter from b. thailandensis . a graphical representation of the genealogy of the various plasmids is presented in additional file 1: figure s <dig> and detailed maps of two representative plasmids, ptn7oluxk <dig> and ptn5/7luxk <dig>  are shown in figure  <dig> table  <dig>

tn5/7-lux based promoter capture in a. baumannii
to demonstrate promoter identification and recovery in a bacterium other than e. coli, ptn5/7luxk <dig> was conjugated into a. baumannii strain atcc <dig>  from the pool of recovered kmr exconjugants, about 1% exhibited strong light emission. four luminescent strains  were retained for further studies. to identify mini-tn5/7-lux insertion sites in these strains, chromosomal dna was isolated and digested with acc65i, ecori and noti. these enzymes were empirically chosen because they cleave chromosomal dna with various frequencies in different bacteria based on g + c content and their capacity for heat inactivation. for instance, in a. baumannii the chromosomal dna cleavage frequency decreased from acc65i to ecori to noti. plasmids harboring the mini-tn5/7-lux elements were obtained after self-ligation and transformation of e. coli pir-116+ strain mah <dig> . the transposon-chromosomal junction sequences were determined by sequencing and aligning the sequences thus obtained to the chromosomal sequence  of a. baumannii strain atcc <dig>  these analyses revealed single mini-tn5/7-lux insertions in isolate ifd <dig> , ifd <dig>  and ifd <dig>  and two insertions in strain ifd <dig> . in an attempt to insert the respective mini-tn7-lux elements located on the respective delivery plasmids into the a. baumannii chromosomal tn <dig> attachment site they were conjugally transferred from e. coli rho <dig> into strain atcc <dig> together with the helper plasmid ptns <dig>  <cit> . although luminescent exconjugants were observed, pcr screening of  <dig> colonies revealed no mini-tn7-lux insertion at the atttn <dig> site but rather only strains in which the mini-tn7-lux elements had integrated at the respective chromosomal loci via reca-mediated homologous recombination. to minimize homologous recombination events, we identified potential promoter regions upstream of the previously identified mini-tn5/7-lux insertion sites. these analyses revealed the presence of multiple potential promoters in the a1s_0944–a1s_ <dig> intergenic region that is located upstream of the mini-tn5/7-lux insertion site in a1s_ <dig> encoding a putative vanillate o-demethylase oxygenase subunit. the region containing the putative gene  <dig> promoter region  was pcr-amplified and directionally cloned into ptn5/7luxk <dig> to create ptn7ph1aluxk <dig>  kmre. coli mah <dig> transformants containing the desired promoter insertion were identified by screening for increased luminescence as the ptn5/7luxk <dig> vector with a promoter-less lux operon confers negligible luminescence. the mini-tn7-ph1a-lux element was then transposed into the atcc <dig> chromosome. the resulting strain ifd <dig> containing the mini-tn7-ph1a-lux transposon integrated at the chromosomal atttn <dig> site emitted slightly less light than the original strain ifd <dig>  which contained two separate mini-tn5/7-lux insertions .table  <dig>

luminescence from mini-tn7-lux elements in bacteria with multiple atttn <dig> sites is insertion site dependent
noting that bacteria which contain multiple mini-tn7-lux insertions due to the presence of multiple tn <dig> insertion  sites exhibit differential luminescence we decided to examine light emission from bacteria which naturally contain more than one mini-tn <dig> insertion site and in which luminescence is thus either insertion site-dependent or due to multiple insertions.

during isolation of b. pseudomallei strains containing mini-tn7-lux elements we noticed that the resulting strains emitted various amount of light and this seemed to be promoter and insertion site dependent. in this study we therefore compared various promoters, including p. aeruginosa ppa <dig>  <cit> , b. pseudomallei pompa  <cit>  and ptolc  <cit>  cloned upstream of the lux operon residing on ptn7oluxk <dig> and inserted at diverse atttn <dig> sites in the genome of b. pseudomallei strain bp <dig> , an aminoglycoside susceptible Δ derivative of the select agent excluded strain bp <dig>  <cit> . kanamycin resistant transformants were patched onto km-containing lb plates and light production was compared. in this system, light production from a lux operon transcribed by pompa was consistently strongest followed by ppa <dig> and ptolc . mini-tn7-lux insertion into the glms1-associated atttn <dig> site consistently conferred the greatest luminescence while strains carrying single mini-tn7-pompa-lux insertions into the glms2-associated or glms3-associated atttn <dig> sites produced consistently less luminescence . a strain carrying simultaneous insertions of mini-tn7-pompa-lux in all three b. pseudomallei atttn <dig> sites was not observed.figure  <dig>

discussion
the mini-tn5/7-lux vectors were employed to successfully identify, capture and clone promoters capable of producing significant amounts of light in e. coli and a. baumannii under laboratory conditions. while in this study efforts were focused on vector construction and evaluation in vitro, future efforts must include studies aimed at promoter activity evaluation in suitable in vivo model systems, especially with pathogens such as a. baumannii and others. in e. coli, the ribose operon promoter was the strongest promoter we identified in this study. this was somewhat surprising because expression from this promoter is normally repressed by the ribose operon repressor rbsr and induced in the presence of the inducer d-ribose  <cit> . in this promoter-capture proof-of-concept study, we only examined prbs-lux gene expression in lb-grown cells which must represent at least partially inducing conditions but the utility of this promoter for in vivo imaging of e. coli infections remains uncertain absent of expression studies in bacteria grown in vivo, e.g. animal infection or cell culture experiments, or in vitro studies employing various conditions encountered by bacteria during infections . the same is true for the a. baumannii ph1a promoter identified and characterized using in vitro laboratory conditions, i.e. lb-grown bacteria. in addition to e. coli and a. baumannii, mini-tn5/7-lux vectors were also used to identify strong promoters capable of driving lux operon expression in lb-grown cells of b. pseudomallei. luminescent isolates could be readily identified suggesting that the system will be useful for promoter identification in diverse bacteria. two promoters that were identified in b. pseudomallei were the put  and paa  operon promoters but since promoters for construction of bioluminescent b. pseudomallei suitable for in vitro and in vivo bioimaging studies, e.g. pompa  <cit>  and ptolc  <cit> , are already available, the put and paa operon promoters were not further pursued.

promoter identification in e. coli, a. baumannii and b. pseudomallei using the mini-tn5/7-lux system identified a frequent scenario encountered with bacteria which is insertion in promoter-distal genes in operons. in practice, this makes direct use of mini-tn7-lux elements with captured promoter regions for isolation of bioluminescent bacteria problematic in reca+ strain backgrounds as the sometimes large regions of homology carried by the transposable element promote recombination into the chromosome instead of site-specific integration via tn7-transposition. while this undoubtedly diminishes the novelty of the mini-tn5/7-lux system, i.e. the combination of the mini-tn5-lux and mini-tn7-lux systems which existed separately before, the newly developed method has several advantages over the separate systems: 1) the newly constructed ptn7lux vectors exhibit expanded repertoire and utility with respect to cloning of promoter-containing dna fragments when compared to previously constructed mini-tn7-lux vectors; and 2) in some instances, e.g. where short promoter-containing chromosomal dna regions are present or recombination-deficient strains are either available or can be readily constructed, the combination of the tn <dig> and tn <dig> transposon allows quick isolation and site-specific insertion of the promoter-lux fusion constructs in naturally occurring tn <dig> attachment site in strains transiently expressing the tn <dig> tnsabcd transposase complex.

in the course of the present study we also noted that in the few instances where bacteria contain more than one chromosomal atttn <dig> site one must be aware of copy number and position effects on reporter gene expression. for instance, incorporation of the same mini-tn7-pompa-lux reporter into one or more of the three atttn <dig> sites in the b. pseudomallei genome resulted in differential levels of light emission. in general, insertions into the glms1-associated atttn <dig> site emitted more light than mini-tn <dig> insertions in either of the other two atttn <dig> sites. although we have no experimental evidence that would explain these observations, insertion site effects may at least be partially responsible for differential lux transcription from constructs integrated at different tn <dig> integration sites. the three atttn <dig> sites found in b. pseudomallei are located in the intergenic regions of glms <dig>  glms <dig> and glms <dig> and the respective downstream genes which in all cases are divergently transcribed from glms   <cit> . the mini-tn7-lux elements insert at these sites such that the lux gene is in the same orientation as these downstream genes which may lead to partial read-through lux transcription from the downstream gene promoters. this may be exacerbated by the fact that insertions at glms <dig> occur in the predicted transcriptional terminator that seems to be shared by glms <dig> and the divergently transcribed downstream gene. in contrast, insertions at the glms2- and glms3-associated atttn <dig> sites do not disrupt the transcriptional terminators of the respective divergently transcribed genes. to minimize transcriptional read-through effects from promoters of adjacent genes, transcriptional terminators could be included inside the tn <dig> left and right ends, but this was not pursued in the present studies. as expected, isolates with double insertions produced more light than those with single insertions and levels were comparable with isolates that contained single insertions at the glms1-associated atttn <dig> site. isolates with mini-tn <dig> insertions at all three atttn <dig> sites resulting from a single transposition experiment are generally rare and were not observed in this study.

CONCLUSIONS
we created a suite of vectors that comprise a versatile system for promoter identification, capturing, cloning and construction of bioluminescent gram-negative bacterial strains that contain the reporter genes stably integrated in the bacterial chromosome. the mini-tn5/7-lux vectors incorporate the random transposition property of tn <dig> catalyzed by transient expression of tn <dig> transposase tnpa in a wide range of bacteria and combines it with the site-specific transposition property of tn <dig> catalyzed by transient expression of the tn <dig> tnsabcd transposase complex in gram-negative bacteria. the system was created with versatility and customization in mind. for example, the vectors are equipped with diverse selection markers to expand their host range to bacteria, which may exhibit intrinsic resistance to some antibiotics commonly used for selection of recombinants. antibiotic resistance markers are flanked by 48-bp frt sites which allow exchange of the resident antibiotic marker with other frt cassettes using unique xbai restriction sites in each frt. all vectors possess unique stui and draiii restriction sites that allow for the deletion of tnpa and its flanking mosaic ends for orientation-controlled insertion of promoter sequences for lux operon transcription. in this study we exclusively tested tn5/7lux and tn7lux vectors for purposes of promoter identification, capturing and cloning for construction of bioluminescent clones. however, their uses extend well beyond these applications. for instance, attb <dig> and attb <dig> sites bordering luxcdabe facilitate exchange of the resident lux operon for other reporter genes such as gfp via gateway bp clonase recombination. vectors on which gfp-transcription is driven from the same promoter identified and used for lux gene expression can then be employed for construction of fluorescent instead of luminescent strains. availability of isogenic bioluminescent and fluorescent strains of the same species has several applications. for instance, they can be employed in bioluminescence, fluorescence, and optical density based real-time assays can to determine the bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal effects of antibiotics  <cit> . furthermore, such strains can be used to differentiate effects of antimicrobials on metabolism. luciferase activity is dependent on availability of metabolites such as atp, fmnh <dig> and a specific fatty acid substrate  <cit>  and its activity thus adversely affected by inhibitors of metabolism whereas gfp activity is not prone to such inhibition. lastly, strain labeling with luciferase or gfp reporters – or dual labeling with both – broadens the repertoire for imaging of various biological processes  <cit> .

these capabilities allow for tailoring the plasmids to investigators’ needs. the tools developed in this study should prove to be useful as their customizability allows for an extremely wide array of uses in diverse gram-negative bacteria.
