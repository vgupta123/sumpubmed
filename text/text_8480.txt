BACKGROUND
postnatal maturation of the heart is associated with substantial changes in energy metabolism, one of the key determinants of performance. foetal and newborn hearts are relatively more dependent on anaerobic glycolysis, using mostly glucose, whereas the mature heart is almost exclusively aerobic, with free fatty acids as the predominant substrate  <cit> . the transition from carbohydrate to fatty acid metabolism  is well documented  <cit>  and involves processes, such as maturation of mitochondria and changes in circulating levels of fatty acids and lactate  <cit> . thus, the immature myocardium is characterised by lower mitochondrial content  <cit>  and lower activities of both tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transport chain enzymes  <cit> . furthermore, contents of both phosphocreatine and total creatine  <cit> , as well as creatine kinase activity  <cit>  show a monotonic increase during cardiac maturation. specifically, myocardial mm-ck and mito-ck isoenzymes increase  <cit> , while relative activities of bb-ck and mb-ck isoenzymes decrease during maturation  <cit> .

creatine is not synthesised in the heart, but taken up by cardiomyocytes exclusively by action of the creatine transporter , a  <dig> kda-plasma membrane protein  <cit> . this transporter is likely to be involved in the regulation of creatine content in the cardiomyocyte during maturation. one recent report focused on regulation of creatine metabolism during pregnancy in spiny mice  <cit> . however, to date, no studies have reported on crt expression and function during cardiac maturation in rats, and in particular, spanning from in utero, through adolescence, and into adulthood.

therefore, the present study was designed to serially examine the mechanisms by which maturation affects transcription and function of crt in the heart. for this purpose, the crt mrna levels were measured in rats of different age using real-time rt-pcr. all currently available anti-crt antibodies cross-react with non-crt polypeptides  <cit>  and consequently a reliable evaluation of crt protein expression is currently not feasible. therefore, creatine transporter function in the developing rat myocardium was assessed by measuring creatine uptake by means of perfusing hearts with 14c-creatine.

plasma creatine levels, myocardial creatine content and cardiac enzyme activities
the mean plasma creatine concentrations, which could be obtained from  <dig> day old animals onwards, are also shown in table  <dig>  during maturation there was a steady decrease of up to 44% in plasma creatine concentration  vs  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mmol/l , reaching significance  from  <dig> days of age onwards.

total creatine content  in the heart significantly  increased during maturation from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/mg protein in - <dig> day old rats to  <dig> ±  <dig>  nmol/mg protein in  <dig> day old rats, corresponding to a ~3-fold increase. similarly, total creatine kinase  activity increased several-fold  during maturation  vs  <dig>  ±  <dig>  miu/mg protein  ). compared with adult heart, b-containing ck isoenzymes are relatively more abundant in foetal myocardium, but total ck activity is much lower. calculating ck isoform activities from total ck and % isoenzyme distribution revealed that the bb isoform did not increase until  <dig> days of age , whilst mb-  and mm-isoforms  increased directly after birth. the activity of mito-ck, which was not detectable until at  <dig> days after birth, increased during growth from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  miu/mg protein. citrate synthase activity, a marker of mitochondrial volume, rose significantly  in a steady manner throughout the perinatal period and reached maximum levels in the adult of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  miu/mg protein.

creatine transporter gene expression
to explore changes in crt mrna expression during maturation, the total rna isolated from rat hearts of different age groups was analyzed using a real-time quantitative rt-pcr technique. the abundance of the transcripts for crt increased steadily with age . at  <dig> days of age, cardiac mrna levels of crt were significantly higher compared with all other experimental groups, showing a ~ <dig>  fold higher relative expression of crt as compared to - <dig> day old rats .

creatine uptake
crt function was examined by measuring creatine uptake by means of 14c creatine labeled heart perfusion. table  <dig> shows the rate of creatine uptake at  <dig> μmol/l extracellular creatine in  <dig> to  <dig> day old rats. creatine uptake steadily increased with age and was significantly higher than in  <dig> day old hearts from day  <dig> onwards. creatine uptake was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/min/gww in the  <dig> day old heart and reached  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/min/gww at  <dig> days of age, i.e. increased by ~65%. thus, creatine content, crt expression and crt function all increased steadily during maturation.

correlations of creatine content and uptake with gene expression
there was a significant correlation  between crt mrna and total creatine levels  as well as crt mrna and creatine uptake .

discussion
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine changes in myocardial creatine transporter  mrna levels, creatine uptake and content during cardiac maturation, which includes the pre-natal period , early postnatal period , the immediate post-weaning period , and the period of sexual maturity  and adult life .

changes of substrate utilisation and myocardial energetics during maturation
the velocity of the ck reaction changes with the size of the creatine pool and also with the accumulation of ck isoenzymes and the shift in isoenzyme distribution  <cit> . the appearance of ck function in myofibrils and mitochondria during maturation has been studied in a number of animal models  <cit> . in agreement with previous studies  <cit> , we showed that mito-ck, bound on the inner membrane of the mitochondria, and mm-ck, a significant portion localised at sites of atp utilisation, e.g. myofibrils, are the predominant isoenzymes in mature myocardium, whereas bb-ck and mb-ck isoenzymes dominate in the immature myocardium. adult levels of mito-ck are not reached until late in development , suggesting that its role in mediating pcr synthesis from oxidative phosphorylation is required at a relatively late stage of maturation. these findings confirm previous results and show that the maturational changes in creatine metabolism described occur in parallel to the expected changes in the creatine kinase system.

in line with previous studies  <cit> , total creatine content in hearts increased 3-fold during maturation. recent findings from ireland et al  <cit>  in the spiny mouse, which, unlike conventional rats and mice, has a long gestation of 38- <dig> days, revealed that the estimated amount of total creatine did not change in the foetal heart between 30- <dig> days gestation, but it increased significantly by postnatal day  <dig>  in the fetus, myocardial creatine is derived both from the mother and from de novo synthesis. during maturation myocardial creatine levels increase as the demand for all energy-requiring processes in the heart rises. likewise, myofibrillar atpase activity increases steadily during the perinatal period  <cit> . thus, energy producing and energy utilising reactions are concomitantly increased within the cardiomyocyte.

alterations of ldh isoform expression and citrate synthase activity
in our study, changes in total ldh activity were accompanied by distinct changes in ldh isoenzyme pattern. specifically, we observed an increase in ldh <dig>  ldh <dig> and ldh <dig> isoenzymes. ldh <dig> and ldh <dig> were predominant in the adult heart, whilst ldh <dig> and ldh <dig> were found to dominate in the foetal heart. these changes are again in line with previous findings  <cit>  and are indicative of the shift from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism during maturation.

similarly, citrate synthase, a marker of mitochondrial volume, increased during maturation. a rise in mitochondrial numbers is consistent with previous studies  <cit>  and reflects the increased energy demand of mature myocardium.

regulation of creatine uptake and creatine transporter expression during maturation
studies using cultured cells  <cit> , isolated rat hearts  <cit>  and in vivo human studies  <cit>  indicate that muscle cells tightly regulate their intracellular creatine content. however, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms by which these cells perform this task are only partially understood. the two enzymes required for creatine biosynthesis l-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase and s-adenosylmethionine:n-guanidinoacetate methyltransferase  <cit>  may be expressed in heart tissue  <cit> , but activities of these enzymes are negligible and therefore creatine is not synthetised in heart muscle in significant amounts. instead, creatine is taken up into the heart by the action of the creatine transporter. during maturation, cardiac creatine levels increase steadily. therefore, we hypothesized that during development the crt-governed creatine uptake is progressively increased.

indeed, we found the maximal rate of creatine transport to steadily increase during maturation, in parallel with both total creatine content and creatine transporter mrna levels. importantly, we found a significant correlation  between crt mrna and total creatine levels as well as crt mrna and creatine uptake . thus during development, 90% of the total variance in creatine uptake capacity and 70% of the variance in creatine content could be explained by changes in gene expression of the crt. this is in contrast to the adult heart, where changes in crt activity in response to genetically altered creatine content were mainly driven by non-transcriptional means, e.g. substrate feedback or post-translational modification  <cit> .

the near maximum rate for 14c-creatine uptake in isolated perfused  <dig> day old rat hearts  agreed with previously published data on adult rat heart  <cit> . the observed increase in heart weight does not explain the observed maturation-induced increase in na+/cl- creatine transport activity because the uptake values were normalised to mg of protein. likewise, garcia-delgado et al  <cit>  found an up-regulation of renal na+/cl- creatine transporter during ontogeny in rats. in their study, age increased vmax, indicating that renal maturation may have increased the density of creatine transporters and/or their turnover rate.

similar to our findings, braissant et al  <cit>  showed detectable crt mrna levels in the rat embryo at  <dig>  day of gestation, while at day  <dig>  and  <dig> , mrna levels were absent. ireland et al  <cit>  recently demonstrated in the spiny mouse that, between gestational day  <dig> and postnatal day  <dig>  cardiac mass increased almost 3-fold and total creatine content increased 2-fold. crt mrna expression, however, did not increase significantly between mid-gestation and gestational day  <dig> and stayed at similar levels until postnatal day  <dig>  thus, the authors suggest that creatine uptake into the heart is facilitated by an increase in crt activity rather than crt protein expression. in contrast, we found a significant increase of crt mrna expression in the rat heart at day  <dig> compared to pre-gestation .

the reason for decreasing plasma concentration of cr at different ages may be related to the fact that cr accumulates in several organs and tissues  between plasma cr and crt gene expression. a decrease in intestinal cr uptake during development  <cit>  may add to this phenomenon of decreasing plasma concentration.

furthermore, phosphorylation of crt by camp-dependent protein kinase a and protein kinase c, which affect crt activity, may be an underlying signal transduction pathway by which the crt in heart is regulated during early development after birth as suggested by others  <cit> .

limitations
unfortunately, to date it remains impossible to determine how the increases in crt mrna, activity and creatine content are paralleled by an increase in crt protein content, since all available anti-crt antibodies cross-react with pyruvate dehydrogenase and other proteins  <cit> . therefore, determining the changes in crt protein expression during development including post-translational regulatory mechanisms remains an important milestone for the future. another limitation of our study is that we did not perform measurements of high-energy phosphate metabolites atp, phosphocreatine, and of the free energy change of atp hydrolysis . however, on wet chemical analysis, phosphocreatine is highly unstable and it would be a challenge to measure this reliably in the smallest hearts. furthermore, delta-g requires measurement of intracellular ph by 31p-mrs in isolated perfused hearts, which is currently not technically possible in the youngest age groups. these analyses are important goals for future research.

CONCLUSIONS
our work shows that the typical alterations of ck and ldh isoenzymes and of mitochondrial oxidative capacity observed during heart maturation are paralleled by a progressive increase of creatine uptake kinetics. moreover, crt mrna in rat heart increased steadily during maturation and this increase was reflected by the myocardial creatine content. our data suggest that the age-dependent increase in the activity of the pcr/ck system is closely paralleled by increases in crt mrna expression, cr uptake and cardiac cr content, reflecting the increasing requirement of the heart for atp turnover over the first  <dig> days of life.
