BACKGROUND
birds preen their feathers with a secretion produced by the uropygial gland, a holocrine bilobular gland located above their tail. the secretion consists of lipids, proteins and salts  <cit>  and varies, for example, among species, age, season and sex  <cit> . these secretions confer different functions regarding sexual attraction, lubrication, waterproofing, antipathogenic effects and plumage maintenance  <cit> . preen gland waxes show a high diversity of components; some species contain monoacyl esters, others diacyl esters or triacylglycerols . the distribution of fatty acids and alcohol residues is often unique, especially branched-chain, extremely long-chain or substituted fatty acids can be found here  <cit> . for instance, the preen gland secretions from chicken  consist of 50% wax diesters and 30% tag  <cit> . wax diesters contain erythro- and threo-alkane- <dig> -diols with chain-lengths of  <dig> to  <dig> carbon atoms and saturated fatty acids of  <dig> to  <dig> carbon atoms  <cit> . diester waxes are detected in other galliform birds as quail or pheasant as well as perching birds, pigeons, cranes or woodpeckers  <cit> , although wax monoesters are the most frequently found components of preen gland secretions. anseriformes like geese  contain wax monoesters in their preen gland secretion, in which di-, tri- or tetramethylated acyl groups are esterified with saturated straight-chain monoalcohols  <cit> . in goose 96% of the alcohol component is due to octadecanol, while the fatty acid residues consist of 76%  <dig> , <dig> -tetramethyldecanoic acid and 11%  <dig> , <dig> -tetramethylundecanoic acid  <cit> . in contrast to the wax monoesters of geese, those found in barn owl  are rich in methyl-branched fatty alcohol and fatty acyl residues. about 60% of the components are monomethyl-branched, mainly 3-methyl-branched c <dig> or c <dig> acids and 2-, 3- or 4-methyl-branched fatty alcohols with  <dig> to  <dig> carbon atoms  <cit> .

production of wax esters has already been observed in preen gland membranes of chicken  <cit>  and goose  <cit> in vitro, so it could be assumed, that genes essential for wax ester biosynthesis are expressed in preen gland tissue. the respective genes have not been identified in birds yet, but wax ester synthase sequences  have already been described in other organisms including mammals  <cit> , plants  <cit> , bacteria  <cit>  and protozoa  <cit> . mammalian enzymes with wax synthase activity have been found within members of both dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> type acyltransferase families  <cit> . dgat  catalyze the final step in storage lipid biosynthesis of tag, but the human dgat <dig> is capable of synthesizing wax monoesters, diesters and retinylesters as well  <cit> . human wax synthases awat <dig> and awat <dig> belong to the dgat <dig> type family. like dgat <dig>  awat <dig> is a multifunctional acyltransferase which shows in vitro acyl-coa:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase , dgat, ws and retinylester synthase activities  <cit> . bacterial wax synthases are at least bifunctional enzymes conferring ws activity next to dgat and low mogat activity  <cit> .

wax esters are excellent lubricants because of their high stability under high temperature and pressure and high resistance to hydrolysis  <cit> . unlike saturated long-chain monoesters, mono-unsaturated monoester or diester waxes combine good lubricity with good thermal and oxidative stability, high viscosity indices  <cit>  and stability against lipases  <cit> . to achieve the renewable production of wax esters, currently attempts are made to identify new enzymes catalyzing respective esterification reactions  <cit> . production of wax esters in oil crops  <cit>  or microorganisms  <cit>  might in future be able to surrogate fossil materials in technical industry.

our studies identified ws genes of chicken, goose and barn owl, members of different bird families with distinct preen wax compositions. as the chicken genome was fully sequenced and assembled in march  <dig> by the national human genome research institute  <cit> , it served as a starting point for the identification of avian ws genes. several sequences were successfully cloned and functionally analyzed in yeast cells.

RESULTS
identification of putative wax synthases from avian organisms
sequence similarity based searches conducted with human awat <dig>  awat <dig> and dgat <dig> sequences as queries against the annotated gallus gallus proteome resulted in five full-length sequences. using mrna isolated from preen glands as starting material, we succeeded in cloning the respective cdnas of ggws <dig> , ggws <dig> , ggws <dig>  and ggdgat <dig> , while cdnas of ggws <dig> were synthesized because we failed to amplify the respective full-length sequence. based on the ws sequences from chicken, we were able to clone ws <dig> and ws <dig> from preen glands of barn owl and goose.

the cloned  <dig> bp ggdgat <dig> sequence showed almost 90% identity with the annotated mrna in databases , its central region, however, differed from both annotations. on protein level, ggdgat <dig> displayed 98% identity to a recently identified sequence from turkey  but differed from both annotations of chicken .

the  <dig> bp open reading frame  of ggws <dig> differed from the annotations , especially in the 3'-terminal  <dig> nucleotides, while an alternation in the 5'-region causes a conservative substitution of v66i only .

unlike ggws <dig>  the ggws <dig> orf of  <dig> bp resembled that deposited at ncbi database  except for two conservative nucleotide substitutions , which did not alter the amino acid sequence . comparison with the respective sequences from goose  and barn owl  showed about 90% identity at the cdna level and 94% sequence identity at the protein level .

ws <dig> homologs from chicken , goose  and barn owl  were identical at the nucleotide level. contrasting the ncbi sequence, we found two nucleotide substitutions, t299c and t317g, which led to the exchange of v100a and v124g on protein level .

in silico analysis of putative avian wax synthases
comparison of the avian ws protein sequences with respective sequences from different organisms gave the results illustrated in figure  <dig>  it reveals that ggws <dig> and ggws <dig> possess the highest similarity to human acyltransferases of the dgat2-type  while ggdgat <dig> shows the highest identity to dgat <dig> family members, namely 62% to human acyl-coa:cholesterol acyltransferase  hsacat <dig>  43% to hsacat <dig> and 16% to hsdgat <dig>  avian ws <dig> and ws <dig> proteins share less than 15% sequence identity to both dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> family members and build an own branch of enzymes . ws <dig> and ws <dig> proteins comprise 55% identity to each other and ws <dig> proteins are most similar to transmembrane protein  <dig>  a protein of unknown function found in various organisms .

the relation to the different mammalian acyltransferase families was reflected in further characteristics of the avian proteins like the molecular mass, the transmembrane structure and acyltransferase motifs. conserved domain search revealed that all dgat <dig> family members possessed an mboat  superfamily motif  and the fyxdwwn motif , which is a predicted acyl-coa binding site identified in mammalian dgat <dig> family members  <cit> . furthermore, ggdgat <dig> and the human acat proteins contained the sf motif  <cit>  which might play a role in sterol binding. unlike dgat <dig> family members, dgat <dig> family members like ggws <dig> and ggws <dig> were found to contain an acyltransferase superfamily motif , that was found in ws <dig> and ws <dig> as well. in addition, the hphg motif which is typical for dgat <dig> family members and likely comprises a part of the active site  <cit>  was also found in ggws <dig> and ggws <dig>  while in ws <dig> and ws <dig> homologs the motif was modified to yyhg and fyhg, respectively . ggws <dig> and ggws <dig> have masses of about  <dig> kda with one predicted n-terminal transmembrane domain  and their c-terminal parts stretched into the cytosol like other dgat <dig> related proteins. on the other hand, ggdgat <dig> is a  <dig> kda protein with several predicted tmds typical of dgat <dig> related proteins. with regard to the transmembrane structure, the avian ws <dig> homologs resemble dgat <dig> family members unlike ws <dig> homologs, which differed insofar as the tmd prediction indicated that the c-terminal part of the protein was not located in the cytosol.

expression profiles of wax synthase sequences in chicken
expression profiles of four chicken sequences were analyzed with different chicken tissues to reveal whether the sequences were preferentially expressed in preen glands. as the use of oligo primers did not lead to the amplification of any wax synthase sequence, gene-specific primers were used to synthesize the respective cdnas from  <dig> μg of rna. the comparison of products from the different tissues indicated that ggws <dig> and ggdgat <dig> were almost exclusively expressed in the preen gland, while ggws <dig> and ggws <dig> were expressed in the four analyzed tissues .

functional expression in yeast
to analyze the identities of the avian proteins, the respective cdnas were expressed in a yeast mutant strain lacking tag synthesis. transgenic yeast cultures were supplemented with fatty alcohols from  <dig> to  <dig> carbon atoms to enable wax ester production. lipid analyses of the transgenic yeast cells suggest that most of the avian proteins were functionally expressed and caused accumulation of storage lipids in significant but different levels and patterns . expression of ggws <dig> resulted in the highest levels of wax esters which comprised  <dig> μmol wax ester/g fresh weight, while tag was formed in very low levels only . ggdgat <dig> expressing yeast cells produced almost  <dig> μmol wax esters/g but no tag , whereas all ws <dig> homologs catalyzed the synthesis of higher levels of tag  than of wax esters . the produced wax esters contained mainly dodecanol  and tetradecanol  esterified with palmitoleic  and oleic  acid irrespective of the expressed sequence. in contrast, tag produced by ws <dig> homologs consisted of almost equal amounts of saturated and unsaturated fatty acyl residues. ggws <dig> expressing cells contained storage lipids in very low levels similar to those of the control cells . additional feeding of ggws <dig> expressing yeast cells with myristic acid  gave a 5-fold increase in wax production while the wax level of control strains was not affected. such stimulation was also observed in ggws <dig> expressing cells .

to reconstitute the avian wax biosynthesis in yeast cells, ws were co-expressed with the recently identified fatty acyl-coa reductase ggfar <dig>  <cit> . this enzyme has a specificity for 16:0-acyl-chains, but is also able to produce 14:0-oh in yeast cultures supplemented with 14:0-fa  <cit> . ggws <dig> was chosen for co-expression because it performed the highest ws activities of all analyzed ws enzymes with long chain acyl-acceptors. supplementation with 14:0-fa of cultures expressing both ggws <dig> and ggfar <dig> resulted in the production of fatty alcohols,  <dig> nmol tag/g and  <dig> nmol wax esters per g fresh weight, while expression of ggfar <dig> alone led only to the production of fatty alcohols .

properties of avian proteins
to analyze the substrate specificities of the different avian proteins, in vitro assays were performed with membranes of yeast cells expressing the respective sequences as enzyme source. ws activity was detectable in membranes, but not in soluble fractions, which is in line with the predicted transmembrane domains. under standard assay conditions the ws activities were constant for at least  <dig> μg protein in an incubation time of  <dig> minutes at 35°c . this holds true with regard to yeast membranes harboring ggws <dig>  ggws <dig> and the ws <dig> proteins. unlike ggws <dig>  which did not show acyltransferase activities under any conditions and with any substrates tested, ggdgat <dig> was catalytically active in yeast cells, but not in isolated yeast membranes . addition of detergents, divalent cations or bovine serum albumin did not improve but partially inhibited incorporation rates of the labeled 16:0-acyl-groups into lipophilic reaction products .

ggws <dig>  ggws <dig> and the avian ws <dig> proteins showing ws activity were further analyzed concerning their reaction products and their acyl-donor and -acceptor specificities. as given in figure  <dig>  ggws <dig> and ggws <dig> formed wax esters as main reaction products, while ws <dig> homologs possessed both ws and dgat activities. these results which were in line with yeast expression experiments  clearly demonstrate the mono- or bifunctionality of the respective avian ws .

with regard to the acyl-coa specificities, avian enzymes were most active with saturated acyl-coa thioesters of  <dig> to  <dig> carbon atoms, while the ws and dgat activities were rather low with shorter or unsaturated thioesters. ggws <dig> and ggws <dig> were almost exclusively active with 16:0-coa while the avian ws <dig> homologs produced the highest wax amounts with 16:0- or 18:0-coa and the highest tag levels with 14:0-coa . hence bifunctional ws, especially those of goose and barn owl, displayed different acyl-coa specificities regarding their ws and dgat activities.

in addition to straight-chain acyl-donors, we assayed 2-methyl-branched acyl-coa thioesters of  <dig> to  <dig> carbon atoms as especially barn owls contain many methyl-branched fatty acids in their preen gland secretion  <cit> . to detect ws activity with these substrates we had to increase the protein amount and incubation time. under these conditions ggws <dig> and ggws <dig> showed appreciable activities with branched-chain acyl-coa in comparison to 16:0-coa, while activity of ws <dig> proteins were very low in comparison to 16:0-coa . ggws <dig> displayed the highest activity with 2-methyl-branched 16:0-coa that comprised 70% of the activity determined with 16:0-coa under the same conditions. ggws <dig> performed lower ws activities than ggws <dig> but the substrate specificities of both enzymes were very similar to each other .

analysis of acyl-acceptor specificities showed that all proteins performed the highest ws activities with decanol  or undecanol  in combination with 16:0-coa, whereas no activities could be observed with alcohols shorter than  <dig> carbon atoms . while the enzymes showed very similar activity patterns with saturated alcohols of  <dig> to  <dig> carbon atoms, assays with unsaturated or branched-chain alcohols revealed differences in the substrate specificities of the enzymes. unsaturated alcohols were no suitable substrates for ggws <dig> or ggws <dig> while the ws <dig> proteins used 16:1-oh and 18:1-oh with higher activities than saturated fatty alcohols of the same chain length. with regard to branched-chain substrates, we analyzed  <dig> -dimethyl-octanol  and isoprenols as substrates. although octanol  was not esterified by any enzyme, the  <dig> -dime-8:0-oh was esterified with high activities by all enzymes except ggws <dig> and adws <dig>  isoprenols were converted to prenyl esters by adws <dig> and taws <dig> proteins, while chicken proteins showed low prenyl ester synthase activities only. among the ws <dig> enzymes, geranylgeraniol was the preferred alcohol of taws <dig> and adws <dig> in contrast to the respective chicken protein . as diesters are the naturally occurring waxes in chicken preen glands  <cit> , we analyzed  <dig> - and  <dig> -isomers of dodecanediol as substrates. none of the avian enzymes was capable of esterifying these diols, although activity could be detected in assays with membranes isolated from chicken preen glands .

in summary, we have identified both monofunctional and bifunctional ws enzymes from birds, which differ in their substrate specificities, especially with regard to branched-chain substrates.

in vitro analysis of ws activities in preen gland membranes
to analyze the in vitro ws activities of preen glands, assays were performed with isolated membrane preparations. strong ws activity could be detected in membranes of chicken preen glands, but comparably low activities were obtained in skin or liver preparations, suggesting that ws activity is restricted to preen gland tissue.

the comparison of different acyl-acceptors proved that membranes of preen glands of all tested species were able to catalyze the esterification of straight-chain alcohols, especially 12:0-oh, or branched-chain alcohols like geranylgeraniol or  <dig> -dime-8:0-oh . in addition to ws, membranes of chicken preen glands exhibited strong dgat activity and also high diester synthase activity with  <dig> -dodecanediol.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in this study we present the identification and characterization of the first avian wax synthase sequences. although ws activity has already been demonstrated in vitro for cell free preparations from preen glands of chicken and turkey  <cit> , neither a specific enzyme catalyzing this reaction nor the respective gene has been identified yet. six of nine proteins identified by sequence homologies catalyzed wax ester syntheses in vivo or in vitro  and ws <dig> homologs additionally showed dgat activity.

with most avian proteins, in vivo and in vitro experiments gave consistent results. ws activity of ggdgat <dig>  however, was clearly detectable in yeast cells , but not in enzymatic assays with yeast membranes, in spite of enzymatic assays being more sensitive than feeding experiments. human acat <dig>  to which ggdgat <dig> displays the highest sequence identity, was functionally expressed in yeast cells and showed in vitro acat activity with cholesterol and oleate  <cit> , but ggdgat <dig> did not show acat activity. perhaps we have not tested ggdgat <dig> under conditions suitable for this enzyme so far, or the chicken enzyme has a very low protein stability under in vitro conditions and is rapidly degraded by yeast proteases. this still remains to be determined.

the protein termed ws <dig> is highly conserved among vertebrates and identical in different bird species. it contains a lysophospholipid acyltransferase motif , but the enzymatic activities have not been studied in any organism to date. our experiments could not confirm any acyltransferase activity in vivo or in vitro.

all avian ws are found to be most active with saturated medium-chain alcohols  and saturated long-chain acyl-coa thioesters , but they differ in their reaction products and their activities with certain substrates. ggws <dig>  like the respective homologs from goose and barn owl, are bifunctional enzymes which catalyze both we and tag biosynthesis. they are more active with unsaturated than with saturated long-chain alcohols and effectively utilize branched-chain alcohols like isoprenols as acyl-acceptors, especially adws <dig> and taws <dig>  but they show hardly any activities with branched-chain acyl-coa. in contrast to the ws <dig> homologs, ggws <dig> and ggws <dig> are monofunctional enzymes which are inactive with saturated and unsaturated alcohols of more than  <dig> carbon atoms , but are active with methyl-branched alcohols and branched-chain acyl-coa thioesters . the ability of the chicken enzyme to utilize branched-chain substrates was surprising, as these components are typical for wax esters of barn owl and goose preen glands, but not for those of chicken. perhaps ws <dig> and ws <dig> homologs from barn owl and goose might be even more active with branched-chain substrates than the chicken enzymes. these homologs likely caused the relatively high we formation rates determined in assays with preen gland membranes of barn owl , while the relatively low activities of preen gland membranes of goose might be due to the wax esters containing tetramethylated but not monomethylated acyl-groups like barn owl glands  <cit> .

the secretion of chicken preen glands is rich in  <dig> -diester waxes  <cit>  and preen gland membranes of chicken, unlike those of goose and barn owl, effectively catalyze the esterification of  <dig> -dodecanediol . on the other hand, diester synthase activities with  <dig> -dodecanediol were not detected with transgenic yeast membranes harboring one of the various avian enzymes even when ws assays with yeast membranes were run under conditions identical to those with preen gland membranes. these data suggest that diester waxes might be formed by a ws in chicken which is unrelated to known ws classes or by a related protein, which could not be detected in yeast membranes so far, like ggdgat <dig>  anyhow, chicken preen gland membranes displayed high monoester synthase activities , which is in line with previous findings  <cit>  and supports our results of the ws enzymes expressed in yeast .
