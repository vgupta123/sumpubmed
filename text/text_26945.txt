BACKGROUND
plant cell death occurs during the hypersensitive response  <cit> , response to environmental stress  <cit> , senescence  <cit> , and the development of plant tissues and organs  <cit> . among these phenomena, petal senescence is of interest both because of its importance to the horticultural industry as well as a model for programmed cell death . petal senescence shares a hallmark feature of pcd, namely dna fragmentation  <cit> . in contrast, an early apoptotic event common in mammalian cells, the relocation of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial membrane space into the cytosol, was not detected as a signal for wilting of petunia petal tissues  <cit> . evidently some plant death processes do not necessarily require cytochrome c release as a signal. in arabidopsis protoplasts, when death was induced by c <dig> ceramide, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release were observed early in the death process. however, when protoporphyrin ix was used as the induction signal, although a decrease in membrane potential occurred, cytochrome c release was not observed until after the arabidopsis protoplasts had died  <cit> . in most other studies of various types of plant pcd, cytochrome c release was observed during pcd, for example, in stressed cultured cells  <cit> , tapetal cells  <cit> , proteasome-inhibited epidermal cells  <cit> , and toxin-treated mesophyll cells  <cit> .

subtractive cloning and differential display have been used to identify a number of genes that are highly induced during senescence. consistent with the profound effect of ethylene on floral senescence in ethylene-sensitive flowers, petal wilting is preceded by the up-regulation of both acc synthase and acc oxidase in both petunia and carnation  <cit> . most other genes up-regulated during petal senescence that have been identified so far encode enzymes involved in the degradation and remobilization of macromolecules , including a thiol protease  <cit> , acyl-coa oxidase  <cit> , glutathione-s-transferase  <cit> , dnases and rnases  <cit> , and lipoxygenases  <cit> . other upregulated genes that have been identified have unknown functions, such as a calmodulin-binding protein  <cit>  and a zinc-finger dna-binding protein  <cit> .

in the self-incompatible species petunia inflata, petal senescence can be triggered reproducibly by compatible pollination, with clear wilting symptoms appearing at  <dig> hours after compatible pollination   <cit> . this pollination-induced petal senescence not only minimizes environmental influences, but also provides an inducible system to clone and investigate up-regulated genes associated with petal cell death. using the technique of differential display during pollination-induced petal senescence, an upregulated gene with similarity to the cyp74c subfamily of cytochrome p450s was identified. sequence analysis indicates the predicted protein  is most related to an unusual tomato allene oxide synthase that preferentially metabolizes 9-hydroperoxides  <cit> . while some aos proteins have been localized to the chloroplast envelope, analysis of transgenic plants carrying picyp74c <dig> fused to gfp indicate that the p. inflata protein is located in the tonoplast.

RESULTS
isolation of psr genes
morphologically, programmed cell death  can be divided into two distinct stages  <cit> , condemned/latent stage and execution stage. in the condemned stage, no obvious morphological changes are visible and the duration is quite variable. at  <dig> hours after compatible self-pollination , the p. inflata flowers appear quite normal but are condemned; at  <dig> hours the flowers are quite wilted  <cit> . to identify genes that are up-regulated during the condemned phase of petal senescence, differential display  was used to compare mrna expression profiles  <cit>  from transcripts of young petals from flowers that just opened with those of senescing petals from flowers at  <dig> and  <dig> hacp. this comparison was to identify those genes which may be involved in early events  during the condemned phase as well as gene involved in late events of senescence equivalent to the execution stage in apoptosis  <cit> .

fig.  <dig> shows examples of dd gels comparing mrnas of petal tissues collected at the indicated time after pollination. on the  <dig> hacp dd gel, most transcripts showed similar levels of expression at  <dig> and  <dig> hacp . in contrast, the steady-state level of most mrnas at  <dig> hacp is reduced compared to  <dig> hacp . this may be due to a decreased transcription rate or an increased rna degradation. differential bands were cloned into ta cloning vectors and used as probes to confirm increased expression at  <dig> hours on northern blots.

using a 1: <dig> ratio of mrna from petals at  <dig> hacp and  <dig> hacp, a cdna library specific to the petal and enriched in senescence-related rnas was constructed. the primary library was screened for the coding regions of psr genes. two independent clones contained a sequence similar to acc oxidase, an enzyme involved in ethylene biosynthesis. two other independent clones carried a sequence similar to a member of the plant cyp <dig> family, cytochrome p450s. these genes were termed petal senescence related  genes, psr <dig>  and psr <dig> .

construction of full-length cdna of psr <dig> and characteristics of cyp74c9
several cdna clones with partial coding regions were isolated for psr <dig> by cdna library screening. two 3' end sequences have been identified, implying the existence of two polyadenylation sites, which are marked with arrows in fig.  <dig>  surprisingly, the sequence isolated by dd is located in the 5' coding region between nucleotide  <dig> to  <dig> , which is probably due to the presence of an at rich sequence . in order to obtain the 5' sequence, a 5' race method  <cit>  was used and extended the 5' sequence by  <dig> nucleotides . the longest orf encoded by psr <dig> is  <dig> amino acids, which is preceded by two in-frame nonsense codons .

the predicted protein product of psr <dig> shows significant sequence identity to the p <dig> enzymes in the cyp <dig> subfamily . members of this family have been shown to function either as allene oxide synthase , hydroperoxide lyase , or divinyl ether synthase   <cit> . the predicted 480-amino-acid protein exhibits 68% identity and 86% similarity to a well-characterized  <dig> amino-acid tomato protein that has been shown to exhibit aos activity on 9-hydroperoxides  <cit> . the predicted petunia protein contains a conserved ppgp tetrapeptide near the amino terminus  that is also common in p450s, a membrane hinge that is known to be important for p <dig> stability and catalysis  <cit> . the unique feature of the cyp <dig> subfamily is the oxygen-binding pocket, the i-helix. in contrast to the consensus i-helix  in most p450s, the threonine residue is substituted with either isoleucine, alanine, or valine   in aos, hpl, and des enzymes. the presence of gxxxv in picyp74c <dig> indicates that the protein is a peroxide dehydrase rather than an oxygenase, consistent with the known properties of this cytochrome p <dig> subfamily. three members of each group within the cyp74c family and the cyp74d family are compared in two conserved regions in fig.  <dig>  in the i-helix region, the aos group is more similar to the hpl group than to the des group. in the heme binding region, the aos group exhibits sequence similarities to both the des and hpl groups .

phylogenetic analysis  is consistent with the assignment of the psr <dig> gene product as a cyp74c family member and with its likely activity as an allene oxide synthase operating on 9-hydroperoxides. this maximum parsimony analysis organizes the proteins as expected in the cyp74a, cyp74b, and cyp74d sub-families. the cyp74c members assort into two groups, comprised of those with hpl or aos activities, with picyp74c <dig> clearly located with the proteins with known aos activity . the tree generated by nearest neighbor analysis is quite similar, also separating the aos and hpl cyp74c members.

developmental and tissue-specific expression of psr2
analysis of the time course of psr <dig> expression shows that psr <dig> mrna is not detectable on rna blots immediately after opening but is strongly up-regulated at  <dig> hacp . the peak expression of psr <dig> was at  <dig> hacp and then declined at  <dig> hacp. psr <dig> was also induced in senescing stamens and pistils at  <dig> hacp and senescing petals of unpollinated flowers  <dig> days after opening , suggesting that psr <dig> may be useful as a molecular marker of floral senescence.

among the different tissues tested, psr <dig> was expressed at low levels constitutively in the root and stem and at much lower levels in other young tissues, including healthy leaves and tissues from unopened flowers . a densitometry measurement shows that the induced level of psr <dig> mrna in the pollinated petals at  <dig> hacp is about 40-fold higher than the constitutive level in either root or stem . since treatments with ethylene and jasmonates have been shown to accelerate petal senescence in p. hybrida  <cit> , ethephon or meja was applied to detached flowers of p. inflata. ethephon is a commonly used substitute for ethylene and easily converted into ethylene within plant cells  <cit> . in the presence of  <dig> mm ethephon, p. inflata flowers wilted within  <dig> hours , whereas with simple distilled water treatment, detached flowers could last more than  <dig> days . meja treatment seemed to promote a change in petal color rather than physical wilting . both ethephon treatment and meja treatment  caused a transient increase in psr <dig> transcripts in detached flowers.

characterization of psr <dig> gene organization and promoter elements
a dna blot probed with a psr <dig> cdna under stringent washing conditions showed that psr <dig> is a single copy gene , as is the highly similar tomato gene encoding leaos <dig>  <cit> . however, additional faint bands appeared after long exposure, suggesting the presence of similar sequences in petunia . by screening a p. inflata genomic library  <cit> , the promoter region and the genomic copy of psr <dig> were isolated. in the genomic clone with the longest 5' sequence, the upstream regulatory region is  <dig> bp . a ccaat box is located at - <dig> to - <dig> and a tata box is at - <dig> to - <dig>  other cis-elements include a gcc box which may be ethylene responsive  <cit> , three tca motifs , and several potential binding sites for myb transcription factors including maize p and petunia petal epidermis-specific myb.ph <dig>  <cit> . the putative transcription start site  is in agreement with both the plant consensus start sequence  <cit>  and the sequence obtained from the 5' race . the p. inflata psr <dig> gene does not have introns. in the transcribed region, there is only one nucleotide difference between the psr <dig> genomic clone and the cdna clone we sequenced. at position  <dig> there is a t in the genomic sequence and a c in the cdna sequence; because it is in the third position of the codon, the predicted amino acid sequence is not affected.

cellular localization of picyp74c9
picyp74c <dig> lacks any defined targeting signal; analysis by a variety of web-based localization informatics programs gave inconclusive and contradictory results. to investigate the location of picyp74c <dig>  the full coding region was fused in-frame to an enhanced gfp  <cit>  and a strong promoter  <cit>  and introduced into nicotiana tabacum by agrobacterium-mediated transformation.

a number of transgenic tobacco plants were identified that express the fusion protein at relatively high levels, according to immunoblot analysis with anti-gfp antibody . all transgenic plants exhibited normal morphology and fertility. microscopic analysis of transformed cells indicated that the signal was found in the tonoplast membrane , as images were comparable to those obtained with a known tonoplast aquaporin/gfp fusion  <cit> . images of isolated vacuoles verified the localization as in the tonoplast membrane .

because the gfp fluorescence signal was relatively weak, despite readily detectable gfp by immunoblot analysis of total leaf extracts, we considered the possibility that non-fluorescent gfp might be located in additional subcellular organelles, especially since certain aos enzymes are known to be located in plastids  <cit> . we fractionated cells to determine the subcellular location of the gfp fusion by immunoblot analysis. we prepared chloroplast, mitochondria, peroxisome, and tonoplast fractions and probed with an anti-gfp antibody and appropriate controls for our fractionation . gfp signal was detected only in the tonoplast membrane . the picyp74c9::gfp fusion exhibits a higher mobility when denatured at 50°c vs.100°c . proteins were treated at the lower temperature treatment  because the control tonoplast marker, vacuolar pyrophosphatase, is unstable at high temperature  <cit> .

discussion
the identification of macromolecules that increase in abundance during petal senescence is critical for our understanding of this process. although a number of genes have been cloned that are highly expressed in senescing petals, the signal transduction pathways remain poorly understood. in addition to picyp74c <dig>  a second highly induced known gene that we also identified during our study encodes acc oxidase, which is involved in ethylene biosynthesis. the identification of acc oxidase is not surprising, given that ethylene is known to be important in signaling petunia floral senescence  <cit> . the ethylene peak in p. inflata petal tissue starts from  <dig> hacp and peaks at  <dig> hacp  <cit> . this ethylene surge lags behind the up-regulation of acc oxidase mrna  which shows up-regulation starting after  <dig> hacp . this timing supports the theory that de novo synthesis of ethylene is required for the increased ethylene level.

our previous study  <cit>  showed that the total amount of rna decreased about 50% at  <dig> hacp. up to  <dig> hacp, the steady-state levels of the psr <dig> and psr <dig> transcripts continue to increase despite collapse of the floral shape and decrease in total rna and protein contents, suggesting that psr <dig> and psr <dig> transcripts are either continuously transcribed or protected from the large-scale degradation of rna in the senescing petal. this indicates active regulation of petal senescence by the plant.

both ethylene and meja induced expression of psr <dig> in unpollinated petals. jasmonates also evidently play a role in the regulation of the gene encoding leaos <dig>  the cyp74c member most closely related to picyp74c <dig>  as expression of leaos <dig> in roots did not occur in a tomato mutant insensitive to jasmonates  <cit> . leaos <dig> transcripts were found in germinating seedlings and roots but not cotyledons, mature leaves, stems, nor flower buds; evidently senescing tissue was not tested  <cit> . our data suggests that it will be worthwhile to examine the expression of the genes encoding leaos <dig> and the similar staos <dig> protein in stressed tissues to find out whether all of these synthases are upregulated during programmed cell death. likewise, it will be interesting to determine whether or not leaos <dig> and staos <dig> are targeted to the tonoplast.

p <dig> enzymes constitute a superfamily of enzymes that are important in the oxidative, peroxidative, and reductive metabolism of numerous endogenous compounds . the cyp <dig> family does not require molecular oxygen, instead the oxygen is provided by the hydroperoxide substrates. there are a number of products and derivatives of the cyp <dig> enzymatic reactions, and some of these have well-known signaling properties while others are of unknown biological activity . at present the family is divided into four sub-groups, but as more becomes known about these unusual p450s, perhaps five sub-groups will be warranted. the hpl and aos activities on 13-hydroperoxides have been characterized in more species than the 9-hydroperoxides-preferring enzymes and clearly fall into two sub-families . neither cyp74c nor cyp74d enzymes have been found in the arabidopsis genome; indeed, at present, the aos cyp74c enzymes are known only in solanaceae , while the hpl cyp74c enzymes have not yet been described in this family. as well as enzyme activity, future analysis may reveal whether intracellular localization also differs between sub-families and between the hpl vs. aos cyp74c proteins.

our results indicate that picyp74c9::gfp expressed in tobacco leaves is localized in tonoplasts but not in chloroplasts, mitochondria, nor peroxisomes. we presume that picyp74c <dig> is also located in the tonoplast in petunia during petal senescence. to our knowledge, this is the first example of a cyp <dig> subfamily member to be localized in the tonoplast. both n-terminal  <cit>  and c-terminal  <cit>  gfp fusions with known tonoplast proteins have resulted in gfp labeling of the tonoplast. none of the computer programs we tested  predicted picyp74c <dig> to be located in either plastids, mitochondria, or the secretory pathway.

the tonoplast localization of picyp74c <dig> is intriguing given recent information about the important role of the vacuole in programmed cell death. while it has been known for some time that caspase activity is involved in both developmental and hypersensitive response cell death, only recently has the vacuolar processing enzyme been shown to exhibit caspase activity that is important for the execution phase of several types of pcd  <cit> . during senescence, cell contents can be recycled by digestion in vacuoles in the process of autophagy  <cit> . in some types of developmental programmed cell death, including petal senescence, the final stages coincide with ultrastructural changes and permeabilization of the tonoplast and other membranes . confirmation of the allene oxide synthase activity of picyp74c <dig> on 9-hydroperoxides and identification of the products may give insights into the role of this protein in petal senescence. future analyses of the picyp74c <dig> protein should also reveal the significance of its compartmentation in the tonoplast.

CONCLUSIONS
by the technique of differential display, we have identified a cytochrome p <dig> that is expressed at a level  <dig> times greater in senescing petals than in vegetative tissue. upregulation occurs in response to compatible pollination, ethylene treatment, or jasmonate treatment. the petunia gene encodes a protein highly similar to a tomato cyp74c protein known to exhibit allene oxide synthase activity, preferentially on 9-hydroperoxides. both a complete cdna and genomic sequence of this single-copy gene have been obtained the promoter region of the petunia gene exhibits several motifs found in stress-responsive genes as well as binding sites for a petunia transcription factor. a c-terminal gfp fusion protein was located in the tonoplast, a compartment where cyp <dig> members have not previously been detected. phylogenetic analysis indicates that the cyp74c subfamily may warrant future division into two groups, as more information becomes available about aos and hpl enzymes acting on 9-hydroperoxides.
