BACKGROUND
the precise patterning of the developing skeletal framework relies on the appropriate control of chondrogenesis, a multistep process during which mesenchymal cells differentiate into chondrocytes <cit> . this process is tightly regulated by transcription factors, including sox <dig>  <cit> . mice lacking sox <dig> display distortion of numerous cartilage-derived skeletal structures <cit> . in addition, mice overexpressing sox <dig> in chondrocytes show dwarfism with decreased chondrocyte proliferation and delayed endochondral bone formation <cit> . however, the precise mechanism how sox <dig> regulates chondrogenesis both spatially and temporally is still largely unknown.

carm <dig> belongs to a family of arginine-specific protein methyltransferases , which includes at least eight members   <cit> . all prmt family members share a core arginine methyltransferase region composed of a conserved ado-met binding domain and a more divergent c-terminal domain. carm <dig> has been shown to synergistically activate transcription with nuclear receptors in combination with other coactivators, such as p <dig> family, p300/cbp and src-2/tif2/grip <dig> <cit> . after recruitment to promoters of steroid-responsive genes, carm <dig> methylates specific residues  at the n-terminus of histone h <dig> resulting in transcriptional activation <cit> .

RESULTS
skeletal phenotype of carm <dig> null mice
to examine the potential role of carm <dig> in skeletal development, we analyzed carm <dig> null embryos, which die immediately after birth as reported <cit> . at e <dig> , before ossification starts, embryos did not exhibit significant differences by alcian blue and alizarin red staining. however, at e <dig> , ossification in null mutants was remarkably delayed, and the size of null mutant was smaller compared with heterozygotes . at e <dig> , the difference between null and wild type gets relatively weak . using von kossa staining, we observed that absorption of calcified cells in null mutants at e <dig>  was delayed . in situ hybridization  of, col2a <dig>  col10a <dig>  bone sialoprotein , osteopontin , osteocalcin  and runx <dig> in mutant embryos supported the conclusion that endochondral bone formation was significantly delayed . importantly, brdu pulse-labeling of cells in e <dig>  carm1-null and wild type mouse embryos revealed a marked reduction in the number of brdu-positive chondrocytes in mutant compared with wild type embryos , indicating that chondrocyte proliferation in mutant embryos was inhibited.

bone development of carm1-transgenic mice
for gain-of-function analysis, we generated transgenic mice in which carm <dig> expression is driven by the ubiquitously expressed beta-actin promoter . in contrast to null mutants, carm1-transgenic mice analyzed at e <dig>  were larger than controls . alizarin red positive regions appeared at the shaft of humerus in e <dig>  carm1-transgenic mice but were not visible in wild type mice . von kossa staining showed absorption of calcified regions was also accelerated in e <dig>  transgenic compared with wild type mice , while safranino staining was unchanged and chondrocyte differentiation marker, col2a <dig> and col10a <dig> expression was not significantly altered in cartilage in e <dig>  transgenic compared to wild type mice . these data indicate that endochondral bone formation in carm <dig> transgenic mice is accelerated relative to wild type mice, although we could not exclude the possibility that carm <dig> may also directly regulate osteoblasts differentiation.

carm <dig> expression in growth plates
to evaluate a potential functional link between sox <dig> and carm <dig>  we examined their expression patterns during bone formation. carm <dig> mrna expression was high in proliferating chondrocytes of growth plates. immunohistochemistry of sox <dig> and ish analysis of col2a <dig> show that sox <dig> and col2a <dig> expression overlaps with that of carm <dig> at the proliferating zone of wild type e <dig>  growth plates , although chondrocytes at the prehypertrophic zone express lower levels of carm <dig> but relatively abundant sox <dig> and col2a <dig> <cit> .

sox <dig> and carm <dig> interaction
we next asked whether carm <dig> and sox <dig> interact. in a gst-pull down assay, full length gst-sox <dig> protein bound to in vitro translated carm <dig> protein, suggesting direct interaction . to define the interaction domain of sox <dig> with carm <dig>  we performed the assay using in vitro translated carm <dig> and bacterially expressed gst-sox <dig> fragments. full length gst-sox <dig>  and 328-508aa and 423-508aa fragments interacted with carm <dig>  while 1-327aa and 1-422aa fragments did not . taken together, carm <dig> likely interacts with sox <dig> via the sox <dig> carboxy-terminal domain, which was previously reported to be a transcription activation domain <cit> .

carm <dig> methylates sox9
since carm <dig> methylates some non-histone proteins, such as cbp/p <dig> <cit>  and splicing factors <cit> , we asked whether sox <dig> can serve as a substrate for carm <dig>  recombinant flag-sox <dig> was incubated with recombinant carm1/prmt <dig> or prmt <dig> in the presence of 3h-labeled s-adenosyl-l-methionine  as a methyl donor. histone h <dig> was assayed as a positive control because h <dig> can be methylated by carm <dig> and prmt <dig> <cit> . we observed that sox <dig> could be methylated by carm1/prmt <dig>  but not by prmt <dig> . arginine methylation was also seen in endogenous sox <dig> immunoprecipitated from mouse  or human  primary cultured chondrocytes. a recent report showing that the hmg domain of hmga1a can be arginine-methylated <cit>  prompted us to determine whether arginine residues in the hmg domain of sox <dig>  are carm <dig> targets. based on in vitro methylation assays, simultaneous mutation of five arginine residues within the hmg domain ) completely abolished methylation signals, whereas mutants exhibiting r177k, r178k and r179k ) were methylated similarly to wild type . these data indicate that carm <dig> methylates multiple arginine residues within the hmg domain of sox <dig> 

carm <dig> regulates chondrocytes proliferation
decreased chondrocyte proliferation phenotypes seen in sox <dig> transgenic mice are partly explained by the model that sox <dig> competes with tcf/lef for binding to beta-catenin and regulates chondocyte proliferation via cyclin d <dig> expression. the beta-catenin/tcf complex binds the tcf/lef consensus site in the cyclin d <dig> promoter, transactivating cyclin d <dig> <cit> . sox <dig> reportedly inhibits transcriptional beta-catenin activity, an inhibition that does not result from competition by sox <dig> with tcf/lef for tcf/lef dna-binding sites <cit> . to determine whether arginine methylation of sox <dig> modulates its interaction with beta-catenin, we transfected wild type and methylation point mutant forms of flag-tagged sox <dig> expression plasmids into sw <dig> cells, a chondrosarcoma cell line. immunoprecipitation analysis showed that carm <dig> overexpression decreased the interaction between flag-tagged sox <dig> and endogenous beta-catenin proteins . by contrast, protein with mutation of all sox <dig> methylation sites  strongly interacted with beta-catenin, even when carm <dig> was overexpressed, suggesting that methlyation of carm <dig> inhibits the interaction between sox <dig> and beta-catenin or that carm <dig> binding to sox <dig> blocks beta-catenin binding. we also checked whether these mutations on sox <dig> may effect on cellular localization. mutants sox <dig> r177k, r178k and r179k were mainly located in the nucleus as well as wild type sox <dig>  when they were orverexpressed in the sw <dig> cell line .

carm <dig> regulates cyclin d <dig> expression
cyclin d <dig> expressed in proliferating chondrocytes of growth plates is required for normal chondrocyte proliferation <cit> . in growth plates of e <dig>  carm1-null mutants, cyclin d <dig> mrna levels were reduced , whereas col2a <dig> was expressed in the limb bud of carm1-null mutants . by contrast, cyclin d <dig> mrna levels were remarkably increased in e <dig>  carm1-transgenic mice . these data suggest that carm <dig> promote cyclin d <dig> gene expression. to determine how carm <dig> regulates cyclin d <dig> expression, we performed cyclin d <dig> promoter assays in human embryonic kidney  <dig> cells, which express endogenous lef <dig>  on the -963cd <dig> cyclin d <dig> promoter reporter plasmid and on a tcf mt reporter plasmid with a mutation in the tcf binding site <cit> , sox <dig> inhibited basal promoter activity, as previously reported . carm <dig> overexpression rescued inhibition by sox <dig> in this assay, suggesting that carm <dig> may inhibit sox <dig> and beta-catenin complex formation and thus increase cyclin d <dig> expression. in contrast carm <dig> and sox <dig> did not activate transcription using the tcf mt reporter plasmid, which lacks beta-catenin reactive sites. with the mutation at all  <dig> , <dig> , <dig> shows strong suppression at cyclind <dig> promoter, however, this suppression did not relieved by overexpression of carm <dig> . this suggests that carm <dig> and sox <dig> may cooperatively regulate cyclind <dig> promoter activity.

evidence of carm1-dependent cyclin d <dig> regulation prompted us to ask whether reduced chondrocyte proliferation may partly explain bone development phenotypes seen in carm1-null mutant and transgenic embryos. consistent with brdu experiments , carm1-null chondrocytes showed remarkably lower cyclin d <dig> mrna than that seen in carm1-heterozygotes and wild type chondrocytes . carm1-heterozygotes chondrocytes showed quicker disappearance of cyclin d <dig> mrna than wild type. furthermore,  <dig> % of carm1-null chondrocytes were in s-phase, compared with  <dig> % in heterozygous chondrocytes, a typical shift seen following cyclin d <dig> downregulation   <cit> . taken together, these data support the idea that reduced chondrocyte proliferation in carm1-null mutant embryos is partly due to inhibition of cyclin d <dig> expression .

CONCLUSIONS
sox <dig> function is likely regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination or sumoylation  <cit> . here we demonstrate that sox <dig> is arg-methylated by carm <dig>  carm <dig> is involved in the epigenetic programming of early embryo development <cit> , and also early t cell development <cit> . our study shows that carm <dig> also plays a key role in cartilage development. further analysis of the role of carm <dig> on chromatinized and non-chromatinized substrates during different developmental stages should indicate the physiological role of arginine methylation signals.
