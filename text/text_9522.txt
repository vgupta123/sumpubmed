BACKGROUND
signaling through the wnt pathway begins with wnt ligands, secreted growth factors that interact with a frizzled  cell surface transmembrane receptor together with co-receptors of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein  family to initiate the signal cascade  <cit> . wnt binding to fz leads to hyperphosphorylation of dishevelled  <cit>  which inhibits the activity of glycogen synthase kinase- <dig> . this, along with destabilization of axin, prevents apc-mediated degradation of β-catenin leading to its accumulation. β-catenin is then available to bind to members of the lymphoid enhancer factor/t-cell factor  family of hmg-box transcription factors  <cit>  and induce the transcription of growth regulatory genes such as myc  <cit>  and cyclind <dig>  <cit> . cell surface expression of lrp5/ <dig> appears to be necessary to induce this β-catenin-dependent  wnt signaling  <cit> . in its absence, wnts may bind to fz receptors and initiate distinct, non-canonical signaling cascades  <cit> .

recently, a non-wnt ligand has been described that binds selectively to fz receptor subtype- <dig>  and induces canonical wnt signaling  <cit> . this ligand, norrin, binds with high  affinity to fz <dig> and canonical pathway activation via this interaction is dependent on the presence of cell surface lrp <dig>  <cit> . norrin appears to promote angiogenesis. overexpression in norrin deficient mice induces the growth of ocular capillaries  <cit>  and inactivating mutations results in norrie disease which is characterized by ocular vascular defects and sensorineural deafness related to impaired cochlear vascularization  <cit> . abnormalities in fz <dig> or lrp <dig> result in a phenotypically similar condition, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy  characterized by defects in retinal vascular development  <cit> . the clinical similarities in vascular phenotypes caused by norrin, fz <dig> and lrp <dig> mutations in humans and mouse models, along with the high specificity of norrin-fz <dig> binding support the hypothesis that norrin and fz4/lrp <dig> form a functional binding group which is involved in angiogenesis regulation.

wnt signaling is of paramount importance in the colon, with >85% of sporadic colon cancers associated with activating mutations in apc or β-catenin  <cit> . other alterations in wnt pathway components, including lef <dig>  fz receptors and wnt <dig> and wnt5a have been described in colon cancer which may contribute to regulation of wnt signal throughput  <cit> . whether norrin or fz <dig> have functional relevance in the colon or in the pathogenesis of colon cancer is unknown. in this study, we demonstrate for the first time that the components for norrin:fz <dig> signaling are present in the human colon and, in vitro, in normal colonic mucosa-derived cells, endothelial cells and in colon cancer cells. additionally, in normal colonic mucosa-derived cells, fz <dig> expression is regulated by wnt <dig>  the data suggest that, in vivo, cross-talk between colon cancer, colonic mucosa and, perhaps, colonic mucosa-localized endothelial cells may be an important feature of the tumor microenvironment and may impact tumor-mediated angiogenesis.

RESULTS
expression of norrin and norrin receptor components
fz <dig>  the norrin receptor, was expressed in normal colonic mucosa, the normal mucosa-derived colon cells, ncm <dig>  an endothelial cell line eahy <dig>  and each of the tumorigenic colon cancer cell lines, including rko and hct <dig>  except colo <dig> . lrp <dig>  which is essential for the transmission of norrin-induced canonical wnt signals, but may not be necessary for noncanonical signaling, was found in fresh colonic tissue and all of the cell lines tested . similarly norrin mrna was detected in normal tissue and normal-derived and tumorigenic cell lines. these studies utilized reverse transcriptase -pcr, not real time pcr, so do not provide quantitative information as to the degree of expression. confirmation that pcr products represented the specific genes under investigation was attained by direct sequence analysis. therefore, normal colonic tissue, endothelial cells and normal-derived and cancer-derived colonic cell lines  express all of the components necessary for norrin-driven canonical  wnt signaling.

canonical wnt signaling in ncm <dig> and rko
several methodologies were utilized to define the activity of canonical wnt signaling in ncm <dig> and rko cells. incubation with wnt3a conditioned medium  resulted in a small but statistically significant  increase in wnt pathway throughput, measured by luminescence following transient transfection of the super topflash reporter construct, in ncm <dig> cells and a robust and highly significant increase  in rko cells . ncm <dig> cells and rko cells were also incubated in side-by-side co-culture with cell-tracker-labeled rko cells which had been previously transfected with a wnt <dig> expression plasmid . wnt <dig> production by these cells in culture was confirmed by western blot of rko/wnt <dig> cell lysates . prior studies demonstrated that wnt  <dig> induced nuclear β-catenin translocation, a marker of canonical wnt pathway activation in rko cells . rko cells responded with a highly significant increase  in wnt throughput but ncm <dig> cells exhibited decreased wnt activity . to confirm this effect of differential response to wnt <dig> between the two cell lines, with a different methodology, ncm <dig> cells and rko cells were directly transfected with a wnt <dig> expression construct. these experiments confirmed a significant reduction  in wnt throughput in ncm <dig> and increase in rko cells . canonical wnt pathway throughput in these cells was further examined in side-by-side co-culture with wnt5a and wnt <dig> producing cells. exposure to wnt5a, which is known to signal via non-canonical pathways in several experimental systems  <cit> , did not affect canonical wnt activity in either cell. exposure to wnt <dig>  a strong inducer of canonical wnt signals  <cit> , significantly increased wnt throughput in rko cells  but, similar to wnt <dig>  decreased wnt throughput in ncm <dig> cells .

effect of wnt <dig> on fz <dig> expression
ncm <dig>  hct <dig> and rko cells were incubated in partitioned co-culture with wnt <dig> producing cells. under these conditions, wnt <dig> eliminates fz <dig> mrna expression in ncm <dig> cells but not in rko cells or hct <dig> cells . the presence of fz <dig> mrna was determined by rt-pcr with specific oligonucleotide primers. the loss of detectable fz <dig> mrna in ncm <dig> was uniformly confirmed in six separate experiments and was seen only when co-cultured with wnt2-producing cells and not when co-cultured with sham-transfected  cells. the effect was not seen following co-culture with cells transfected with a wnt5a expression construct . expression of fz <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> was not affected by wnt  <dig> . to determine whether the loss of fz <dig> message resulted in changes in fz <dig> protein expression at the cell surface, a norrin-binding assay, utilizing soluble ap-3myc norrin, was performed . exposure of ncm <dig> to wnt <dig> significantly reduced norrin binding activity , indicating a reduction in the cell surface expression of fz receptor capable of binding norrin and suggesting that this is directly resultant from the abrogation of fz <dig> gene expression. no significant change in norrin binding activity was seen for rko cells after exposure to wnt <dig>  consistent with the rt-pcr data. norrin binding activity in ncm <dig> and rko was not affected by incubation with wnt3a cm .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
study of the extracellular and cell surface components of the wnt pathway in tumors and adjacent tissues has received increased attention with the recognition that, even in the face of activating mutations in the pathway present in many cancers, the wnt signal throughput can be modified by promoting or inhibiting signaling through the cell surface receptors  <cit> . in this report, we demonstrate that the components for an alternative mechanism of wnt pathway activation, via norrin and fz <dig>  are fully present in normal colonic mucosa, a normal-mucosa derived cell line, an endothelial cell line and most colon cancer cell lines. in the tumor microenvironment, tumor-derived or mucosa-derived norrin may be available for interaction with mucosal and endothelial fz <dig>  the availability of lrp <dig> implies that signaling through norrin:fz <dig> interactions could lead to canonical pathway activation  <cit> .

this is the first report in a mammalian system where a specific wnt ligand  decreases the expression of a specific fz receptor subtype , without affecting the expression of other fz receptors. the effect was confirmed at both the rna level, by reverse transcriptase pcr, and at the protein level, with a norrin binding assay. furthermore, we demonstrate a degree of tissue specificity: wnt <dig> decreases fz <dig> expression in the normal-derived cells but not in β-catenin-mutated  or non-apc and non-β-catenin mutated  colon cancer cells. since norrin activates canonical wnt signaling  <cit> , the retention of fz <dig> expression by the colon cancer-derived cell lines would favor continued stimulation with this ligand, even in the presence of wnt <dig> which is known to be overexpressed by many colon cancers  <cit> . on the other hand, downregulation of fz <dig> in normal mucosa may protect it from stimulation by norrin or other wnt ligands present within the tumor microenvironment. wnt <dig> did not downregulate the expression of other frizzled receptors, including fz <dig>  therefore, both normal and tumorigenic cells would retain the capacity to respond to stimulation by extracellular wnt ligands utilizing fz <dig> or other fz receptors.

autoregulation within the wnt pathway, whereby wnt signaling affects the expression of genes encoding proteins within its own pathway has been noted previously. wnt3a has been shown by microarray analysis in human teratocarcinoma cells to increase the expression of fz <dig>  <cit>  and wg  is known to inhibit the expression of dfz <dig> in drosophila  <cit> . this is the first report, however, describing wnt-dependent regulation of the norrin receptor, fz <dig>  suggesting the existence of crosstalk between the wnt- and norrin-signaling pathways. the lack of effect of wnt3a  and wnt5a  on fz <dig> expression suggests that the downregulation is wnt <dig> specific. mikels and nusse  <cit>  have shown that wnt5a can signal through canonical or non-canonical pathways, dependent on the cellular context, with non-canonical signals antagonist to canonical signaling. wnt <dig> has been previously described to signal both canonically  <cit>  and non-canonically  <cit> . our data supports the idea that the intracellular response to wnt <dig> may also be context dependent, in that this ligand reduced wnt throughput, and abrogated fz <dig> expression, in ncm <dig> but increased wnt throughput, and did not abrogate fz <dig> expression, in rko and hct <dig>  whether this difference relates to the origin of the cells , or whether the decrease in fz <dig> expression is restricted to cells like ncm <dig> which exhibit a relatively poor response to canonical signals, remains to be defined. interestingly, stimulation with a strongly canonical wnt ligand, wnt <dig>  <cit> , also led to a reduction in wnt signal throughput in ncm <dig>  suggesting that signaling induced by this ligand can also be context dependent.

the precise role of norrin-based signaling in gastrointestinal tract and in the tumor microenvironment is unknown. our data on cell lines in vitro suggests that colonic tumors may have available two autoregulatory stimulatory loops, one which operates via interactions between wnt <dig>  and various fz receptors and one that operates via interactions between norrin and fz <dig>  while human cancers have been shown to overexpress various wnt ligands  <cit> , the level of norrin expression in human colon cancers remains to be defined.

regulation of fz <dig> expression in normal colonic mucosa may be critical for modulation of fz4-based  signaling in the tumor microenvironment. inhibition of fz <dig> expression due to tumor-derived wnt <dig> would decrease fz4-dependent signal throughput, whereas tumor- or normal colonic mucosa-derived norrin would promote fz4-dependent signal throughput. a balance between these opposing forces may be important for maintaining colonic mucosal integrity. because of the known effects of wnt signaling on gastrointestinal stem cells  <cit> , we would also postulate that control of fz <dig> expression on colonic mucosal stem cells may play some role in regulating stem cell differentiation.

additional studies are underway to define whether wnt <dig> has similar effect on endothelial cell fz <dig> in tumor vasculature as it does on normal colon mucosa-derived cells. given the known relationship of mutated norrin and fz <dig> to abnormal vascularization in the eye and ear  <cit> , perturbations in norrin:fz <dig> signaling may be one explanation for the disorganized and "leaky" neovascularization which accompanies tumor-stimulated angiogenesis  <cit> . our data in an endothelial cell line indicate that all of the components necessary for norrin:fz <dig> signaling are present. finally, the role of norrin in the colon cancer needs further exploration in order to define whether this arm of the "wnt" signaling pathway may be a suitable target for cancer prevention or cancer therapy.
