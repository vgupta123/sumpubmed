BACKGROUND
mycoplasma species are known to represent the smallest self replicating organisms on earth, possessing the smallest genomes that contain basically fundamental functions to ensure autonomous life. potential virulence genes are found in many mycoplasmas  <cit> . however, the genome of mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides small-colony type , a mycoplasma species causing one of most severe infectious animal diseases as defined by the world organization for animal health and included in the list of diseases notifiable to the office international des epizooties , does not show classical virulence genes such as toxin, cytolysin and invasin genes  <cit> . m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc causes contagious bovine pleuropneumonia , the most serious cattle disease in africa since the successful control of rinderpest  <cit> . in europe, cbpp re-emerged at the end of the last century after being completely eradicated between  <dig> and the 1980s  <cit> , thus showing that cbpp is still a threat also to continents that have been able to eradicate the disease.

virulence of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc seems to be determined by intrinsic functions such as: i) capsular polysaccharide  that seems to be involved in serum-resistance  <cit> ; ii) lipoproteins that are expected to play a role as triggers in mechanisms of pathogenicity and in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines  <cit> ; iii) yet unknown but necessary adhesion factors that may play a central role in the intimate interactions of pathogenic mycoplasmas with mammalian cells for long periods thus triggering a cascade of signals which are transduced to the host cell and induce inflammation  <cit> ; iv) repeating elements in variable membrane proteins of mycoplasmas that are suggested to increase the pathogen's ability to adhere to host cells and to evade the host immune response  <cit> ; v) immunomodulating factors that can cause apoptosis of the mononuclear cells triggered by live m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc or by a substance released by these mycoplasmas  <cit> ; and vi) toxic metabolic side products such as h2o <dig>  <cit> , which is translocated efficiently to the host cells where it can cause cell death  <cit> .

since no genetic tools for targeted mutagenesis are available for m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc, analysis of virulence factors requires the use of various strains, including field strains from outbreaks of cbpp with various degrees of severity, strains from geographically different areas and live vaccine strains. detailed genetic studies comparing m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc isolates has provided evidence that deletion of gtsc and part of gtsb  in the moderately virulent european strains correlated with a reduced ability to produce h2o <dig> compared to the highly virulent strains of the african/australian cluster  <cit> . vaccine strains of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc such as t1/ <dig>  t1/sr <dig> and kh3j possess however an intact glycerol uptake system and metabolism  <cit> , which do not distinguish them from virulent field strains by means of h2o <dig> production. hence, other functions that determine virulence are expected in m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc. for instance, these vaccine strains seem to produce lower amounts of cps compared to field strains  <cit> . cps seems to play a role in the capacity of persistence and dissemination of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc in the infected host  <cit> . however, the genetic locus of the cps regulation still remains unknown.

we have recently identified by pcr amplification and restriction enzyme analysis  a genetic difference in a structural gene which divides m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc strains in two groups, one including virulent african field strains and the other comprising the t1-derived vaccine strains t1/ <dig> and t1/sr <dig>  as well as european and australian strains and the type strain pg <dig>  <cit> . this genetic difference was found in the bgl gene that codes for 6-phospho-β-glucosidase . bgl is an enzyme that is associated with the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar:phosphotransferase system , a multicomponent system involved in the simultaneous translocation and phosphorylation of sugars by bacteria from both gram-positive and gram-negative genera  <cit> . the pep-pts and bgl are involved in incorporation and subsequent catabolism of β-d-glucosides .

the present work focuses on the characterization of bgl and related disaccharide catabolism, and the possible contribution of sugar metabolism to control cytotoxicity of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc.

RESULTS
genetic variability of the bgl gene in m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc
the  <dig>  kb genomic region containing the genes involved in disaccharide uptake and metabolism in m. mycoides subsp . mycoides sc type strain pg <dig>  whose genome sequence was published by westberg et al.  <cit> , was considered in this study. figure  <dig> shows the expected roles of eiibc, sugar hydrolase, eiia, bgl and suk in the disaccharide transport system and sugar metabolism. the bgl gene from ten selected strains of m. mycoides subsp . mycoides sc  was sequenced with primers listed in table  <dig>  the sequences from the african field strains afadé,  <dig> and  <dig> were identical, although these strains were isolated in geographically distant locations in an interval of as much as  <dig> years. the bgl sequences obtained from the vaccine strains t1/ <dig> and t1/sr <dig>  as well as from type strain pg <dig>  two european and two australian strains presented a single nucleotide polymorphism  when compared to those of the african field strains. the non-synonymous snp involves an amino acid change at position  <dig> of the bgl protein sequence reported recently  <cit> . the group of the three african field strains possesses the bgl isoform val <dig>  while the vaccine strains, the european and australian outbreak strains and pg <dig> possess the bgl isoform ala <dig> 

carbohydrate utilization of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc
the biochemical reactions of all strains tested indicated that m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc can use the monosaccharides glucose, fructose and galactose, and the disaccharides sucrose and lactose. in fact, after incubation of mycoplasma suspensions in serum-free media with high amounts of either substrate in the presence of the indicator bromothymol blue for  <dig> days, all reactions turned light green to bright yellow  in colour, indicating production of co <dig> and therefore carbohydrate uptake and utilization. daily examination of the reactions revealed that there were no significant differences in the substrate utilization rates among the  <dig> strains tested .

m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc induction of cell damage in the presence of sugars
the effect of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc on embryonic bovine lung  cells in the presence and absence of disaccharides was studied. figure  <dig> shows the cell damage mediated by strain  <dig>  chosen as representative of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc strains with the bgl isoform val <dig>  and of the vaccine strain t1/ <dig>  as representative for strains with the bgl isoform ala <dig>  cell damage was expressed by morphological changes mainly characterized by cell retraction, which was evident in monolayers of ebl cells inoculated with strain  <dig> in the presence of sucrose or lactose but not in ebl cells inoculated with vaccine strain t1/ <dig>  with or without these disaccharides. the relative cell damage as a measure for cytotoxicity increased with increasing concentrations of the disaccharides . morphological changes were already noticeable  <dig> h post-inoculation with strain  <dig> in the presence of low concentrations of sucrose and lactose. at  <dig> h, those changes became easily observable  and were more evident at  <dig> h post-inoculation . mycoplasmas incubated in the presence of monosaccharides for  <dig> h had no cytotoxic effects towards ebl cells .

after  <dig> h, cell monolayers infected with strain  <dig> in the presence of sucrose and lactose had almost completely lost confluence and numerous detached rounded cells were observed . morphological cell changes after  <dig> h were also seen with strain  <dig> when incubated with glucose, fructose or galactose, but the degree of cell damage mediated by these monosaccharides was significantly lower when compared to that of the disaccharides . strain t1/ <dig> did not induce cell damage, either in the presence or absence of the five tested sugars . the same was observed with the european strains l <dig> and b345/ <dig> .

the cytotoxic effect observed upon incubation with strain  <dig> in the presence of the disaccharides could not be blocked when the cell monolayers were pre-treated with catalase at a concentration of  <dig> u/ml. under these conditions, the ebl cells showed dramatic morphological changes  <dig> h post infection as in the absence of catalase . strain t1/ <dig> in the presence of disaccharides and catalase  and catalase alone  did not induce cell damage. moreover, no morphological changes were detected when ebl cell monolayers were incubated either with sugars alone, with strain  <dig> alone or with axenic medium .

pnpbg hydrolysis of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc grown on solid medium
hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside  to give p-nitrophenol  was determined qualitatively to assess 6-phospho-β-glucosidase activity by flooding cultures of m. mycoides subsp . mycoides sc on nutrient agar plates with pnpbg solution. after  <dig> h, no colour change was seen with the african m. mycoides subsp . mycoides sc field strains tested , indicating no detectable hydrolytic activity of bgl isoform val <dig>  in contrast, individual colonies of the other strains tested, i.e., the vaccine strains t1/ <dig> and t1/sr <dig>  as well as the european strains b345/ <dig> and l <dig> and the australian strains gladysdale and dvz, which express the bgl isoform ala <dig>  were coloured yellow, indicating hydrolysis of pnpbg . it has to be noted that after prolonged incubation, the three african field strains also showed some hydrolysis of pnpbg, as revealed by a light yellow coloration in areas of confluent growth.

production of h2o <dig> by m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc
production of h2o <dig> after the addition of mono- and disaccharides to suspensions of m. mycoides subsp . mycoides sc strain  <dig> and the vaccine strain t1/ <dig>  chosen as representative strains in this study, was measured. addition of physiological concentrations of the different sugars to the two mycoplasmas tested resulted in a weak release of h2o <dig> into the incubation buffer after  <dig> h. the released h2o <dig> levels measured in the suspensions were at concentrations below or equal to  <dig>  μg/ml, the detection level of the assay. in contrast, the addition of  <dig> μm glycerol to the mycoplasmas instantly resulted in a strong release of h2o <dig> into the incubation buffer, reaching  <dig>  μg/ml by strain  <dig>  and  <dig> – <dig>  μg/ml by vaccine strain t1/ <dig> after  <dig> h. all h2o <dig> concentrations measured were retained up to  <dig> h and showed no significant differences between the two strains.

viability of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc upon incubation with different sugars and growth analysis of surviving cells
starvation in incubation buffer alone, or in incubation buffer supplemented with  <dig> mm glucose or  <dig> μm sucrose affected the viability of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc strains  <dig> and t1/ <dig>  over the first  <dig> h of starvation, there was an overall loss of 7–39% of viable mycoplasma cells. after  <dig> h of starvation, the number of cfu for strain t1/ <dig> declined sharply to a rate of < 1% of the original in the three assays , while that for strain  <dig> was reduced to < 1% in incubation buffer alone and in the presence of glucose, and to approximately 12% in the presence of sucrose .

the estimated quantities of mycoplasma cells of strains  <dig> and t1/ <dig> grown for  <dig> days after a preceding impregnation phase of  <dig> h with sucrose or glucose were determined in the taqman real-time pcr with primers and probe listed in table  <dig>  the ct values shown in table  <dig> are mean values of two or more replicate experiments . results showed that pre-treatment with incubation buffer in the absence of sugars for  <dig> h completely blocked the growth of both strains. also pre-incubation of the two strains of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc with  <dig> mm glucose in incubation buffer affected dramatically their growth rate and the amounts of mycoplasmas grown in the 2-day culture were below 4% when compared to those of non-treated mycoplasmas . pre-incubation with  <dig> μm sucrose blocked the subsequent growth of strain t1/ <dig> , while strain  <dig> retained a growth of approximately 15% of the rate without treatment .

discussion
a single genetic difference between african field strains of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc and t1-derived vaccine strains was reported recently in the genomic region harbouring the genes frva, suk and bgl  <cit> . this genetic difference is an snp in the bgl gene coding for the 6-phospho-β-glucosidase . here we report the correlation of the two isoforms of bgl to the cytotoxic potential of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc.

in cytotoxicity studies where we examined the effect of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc grown in the presence of certain mono- and disaccharides towards cultivated embryonic bovine lung  cells, the group of strains expressing the bgl isoform val <dig> showed high cytotoxicity in the presence of β-d-glucosides. this group contained principally highly virulent african field strains such as strains afadé and  <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, strains with the bgl isoform ala <dig> showed virtually no cytotoxicity in the presence of the two disaccharides sucrose or lactose. most of the strains in this group are considered to be less virulent, in particular the vaccine strains t1/ <dig> and t1/sr <dig> used in this study  <cit> . other strains in this group are the type strain pg <dig> that is not considered to be virulent , the european strains from outbreaks of 1980– <dig>  which primarily caused epidemics with low mortality  <cit>  and of which a characteristic strain was shown experimentally to be of low virulence  <cit> , and the australian strains whose virulence in relation to the former strains has not been described. other disaccharides such as the α-d-glucosides maltose and trehalose were not tested, as it has been shown that m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc are unable to metabolize them  <cit> . qualitative determination of pnpbg hydrolysis by m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc grown on solid medium indicated that strains considered virulent and expressing the bgl isoform val <dig> have a reduced 6-phospho-β-glucosidase activity. it is worthwhile noting at this point, that the pattern and rates of disaccharide utilization were similar among the m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc strains tested and thus there were no differences in substrate uptake that could account for different rates of pnpbg hydrolysis, which could thus be appropriately referred to as bgl activity. however, it has to be considered that the snp was found in the bgl gene, while no genetic differences were found in the genes frva and suk, but it is possible that differences in frvb or in the sugar hydrolase gene are also present and could account for different pnpbg hydrolysis patterns as well. other sugar metabolism genes are likely to be involved in the flow of β-d-glucosides into glycolysis, thus contributing to the similar pattern of disaccharide utilization among strains. in this regard, there are a number of other pts enzymes or sugar metabolism proteins that are annotated in the genome of m. mycoides subsp . mycoides sc  <cit>  and which may also be involved in β-d-glucoside metabolism.

glucosides like disaccharides are among the most important and most common carbon and energy sources for bacteria. disaccharides are accumulated as phosphorylated derivatives by the translocation-phosphorylation mechanism pep-pts and are cleaved by intracellular substrate-specific phospho-glycosylhydrolases such as bgl  <cit> . specifically, bgl hydrolyzes the β-glycosidic linkage between the anomeric carbon and glycosidic oxygen of intracellular phospho-β-d-glucosides. the residual monosaccharides obtained by this enzymatic reaction are then phosphorylated before being metabolized during glycolysis or undergo other metabolic reactions such as sugar oxidation. in mycoplasmas, oxidation of sugars together with oxidation of organic acids or glycerol lead to production of h2o <dig>  <cit> . glycerol-dependent h2o <dig> production was shown to be a virulence determinant in m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc and attenuated strains were found to have a defect in glycerol-related h2o <dig> generation  <cit> . in contrast, the amount of h2o <dig> produced by mycoplasmas grown in the presence of sugars is approximately  <dig> times less if compared to that produced in the presence of glycerol  <cit> . the low production of h2o <dig> by m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc upon incubation with sugars was confirmed in our work and, moreover, in our cytotoxicity studies we could demonstrate that sugar-mediated h2o <dig> production by this mycoplasma does not contribute to induction of cell damage in the host, as addition of catalase, which behaves as a catalyst for the conversion of h2o <dig> into water and oxygen, could not block the cytotoxic effect.

our study indicated that cytotoxicity of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc is related to defective bgl activity. we thus assumed that β-d-glucosides could mediate in some extent repression of certain virulence factors of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc, as already reported for other pathogens  <cit> . this mechanism is known as carbon catabolite repression . in most bacteria, the enzymes involved in sugar transport and phosphorylation are known to play an essential role in signal generation leading through different transduction mechanisms to ccr that may mediate downregulation of virulence genes  <cit> . viability tests and growth analysis of mycoplasma cells that have come through preceding impregnation with sugars in medium-free buffers indicated however that bgl activity was rather involved in the control of growth of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc. in fact, the african field strains that possess the defective bgl isoform val <dig> were found to be more able than vaccine strains, which express the bgl isoform ala <dig>  to preserve viable mycoplasma cells in the presence of β-d-glucosides such as sucrose or lactose, i.e., strains that seem to be particularly virulent are capable to subsist in some degree in environments that contain β-d-glucosides, while strains that have an attenuated virulence are not prone to β-d-glucosides and may succumb. bacterial growth inhibition by elevated sugar metabolism was already described for escherichia coli  <cit> . two different mechanisms for this cessation of growth and substantial loss of viability were distinguished. one mechanism involved cell killing and the other mechanism resulted in growth inhibition without cell death. cell killing was related to increased flux through glycolysis and consequent overproduction of the toxic metabolite methylglyoxal. inhibition of growth resulted from excessive accumulation of organophosphates in the cell or depletion of inorganic phosphate pools  <cit> . it is possible that one or both of these "self-inflicted injury" mechanisms for growth inhibition also occurs in strains of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc considered of low virulence and possessing the active bgl isoform ala <dig> upon elevated utilization of β-d-glucosides. on the other hand, strains possessing the defective bgl isoform val <dig> do not metabolize β-d-glucosides in the same "self-inflicting" way and may rather use the latter in a different molecular mechanism of pathogenicity that enables them to exert cytotoxicity on host cells.

almost no ebl cell damage was observed upon incubation with mycoplasmas in the presence of monosaccharides. minor cell damage was observed only with strains  <dig> or afadé after a prolonged incubation of  <dig> h with glucose, fructose or galactose, while t1/ <dig> was completely non-cytotoxic upon monosaccharide incubation. this indicated the presence of additional determinant of cytotoxicity other than defective bgl activity and glycerol metabolism in m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc. a possible explanation why significant cytotoxicity in our experiments was only seen in the presence of some strains with sucrose and lactose, and not with monosaccharides, can reside in the fact that m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc may be sensitive to high levels of monosaccharides. note that the determined saturation constants  for glucose and fructose in m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc are <  <dig> μm  <cit> , while we have applied calculated physiological concentrations for monosaccharides which were significantly  higher than the km values. it is possible that such high carbohydrate concentrations may determine a high sugar metabolism rate and, consequently, a high production of toxic metabolites. the latter, in turn, may induce cessation of growth of all m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc isolates, similarly to what observed upon starvation of less cytotoxic strains with β-d-glucosides.

as gene inactivation by homologous recombination  <cit>  is currently impossible to achieve in m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc , no bgl inactivation could be assessed in the vaccine strain t1/ <dig> in order to directly verify if the difference in the bgl gene is related to modulation of cytotoxicity of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc or not. however, there is evidence that the detected difference in the bgl isoforms ala <dig> and val <dig> is close to  the catalytic site of the 6-phospho-β-glucosidase, as evidenced in an in silico three-dimensional  localization of amino acid  <dig> of bgl . as no 3d structures are available for bgl of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc, comparison of the bgl sequence from strain afadé with available sequences from the ncbi site was performed with the conserved domain database . alignment with sequences belonging to the cluster of orthologous groups of proteins cog <dig>  and to the protein domain family pfam <dig>  was obtained . comparison of bgl with related proteins that have known 3d structures revealed homologies with the chain a sequences of the β-glycosidase from sulfolobus solfataricus   <cit> , the β-glucosidase from zea mays   <cit> , and the 6-phospho-β-galactosidase from lactococcus lactis   <cit> . as 1pbg_a presented the highest homology with bgl from m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc among the three characterized proteins, the software cn3d  <dig>  from ncbi was used to visualize the 3d structure of 1pbg_a with the aim to envisage the structure of bgl . protein 1pbg_a showed three glu residues in the active site and a val residue in its vicinity. these four amino acids are equivalent to the catalytic triad and the snp-related val residue  in the bgl protein of african field strains of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc. protein 1pbg_a is an active enzyme in l. lactis  <cit>  but we do not have any information as to if its val <dig> is essential or not for enzymatic activity. it has to be noted at this point, that a transition between ala and val not involving the catalytic site has been already reported to be implicated in modulation of enzyme activities  <cit> . such amino acid substitutions may modify the steric properties that are associated with the enzymatic activities by prompting conformational changes near the active site. these conformational changes may arise from the fact that ala and val have a different side-chain volume and therefore a transition ala to val can confer a different secondary structure to the enzyme  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
to cause disease or to be virulent, m.mycoides subsp. mycoides sc possesses multiple molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity  <cit> . these mechanisms permit mycoplasma to adhere to specific host tissue, to evade the host's immune defence, to enable persistence and dissemination in the infected animal, to exert a cytotoxic effect, and to cause inflammation and disease symptoms. the loss of any of these mechanisms can lead to attenuation or loss of virulence. our observations of significant differences in cytotoxicity among bgl variants of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc grown in the presence of different sugars indicate that the β-d-glucoside metabolism is involved in control of pathogenicity of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc. this mechanism is independent of h2o <dig> production, in contrast to glycerol metabolism  <cit> . rather, cytotoxicity observed in the presence of β-d-glucosides seems to be due to the effect of defective 6-phospho-β-glucosidase activity on the containment of cell death. at this point, it is important to know that lungs have an effective innate defence system to counteract the airborne bacteria that are constantly inhaled. these organisms land in the thin layer of the liquid that overlays the cells lining the inside of the lungs. the lung cells produce natural antibiotic substances, such as polypeptides and glycoproteins, and secrete them into the airway surface liquid where they kill the invading bacteria  <cit> . also, degradation of the saccharide moiety of glycoproteins generates sugars  <cit> , which, acting synergistically with other agents, may contribute to provide a defence barrier to colonization and infection in the host's lungs. as sugars are able to affect viability of those bacteria that are able to metabolize them in large amounts  <cit> , a defective 6-phospho-β-glucosidase activity in strains harbouring the bgl isoform val <dig> can contribute indirectly to their higher virulence, due to the fact that they possess a sort of "resistance" to elevated levels of certain sugars and may use them as a supplement for cytotoxicity on host cells.
