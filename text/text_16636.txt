BACKGROUND
bats make up approximately 20% of the extant mammalian diversity and are the second most species rich mammalian lineage after rodents  <cit> . the order chiroptera is divided into two suborders: the megachiroptera and microchiroptera. these two lineages are estimated to have diverged approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . megachiroptera consists of a single family, the old world fruit bats, while microchiroptera includes  <dig> families of echolocating bats. bats have a wide geographic distribution and exploit a variety of environmental niches, being absent only from the polar regions. bats are also hosts to numerous viruses, many of which are highly pathogenic to humans and other mammals yet appear to cause no clinical consequences in bats  <cit> . this group of mammals also shares a variety of unique characteristics that likely facilitate the persistence and spread of the viruses they carry. highly social species, bats live at much higher densities than other mammals. they are the only mammals capable of powered flight and have long lifespans relative to their body size  <cit> . despite their diversity, unique characteristics and role as natural reservoirs for viruses, bats are also the least studied of all mammalian taxa and there is little information available on antiviral immunity in any bat species.

bats are the natural reservoir hosts of more than  <dig> viruses, with new viruses or viral sequences of bat origin being discovered each year  <cit> . rna viruses account for the overwhelming majority of known bat viruses, many of which are among the most deadly known to man, including ebola, hendra, nipah and sars-like coronaviruses  <cit> . many of these viruses, which cause severe morbidity and mortality in humans and other mammals, appear to cause no clinical diseases in bats under natural or experimental infection. the most studied example is the henipaviruses  which are members of the family paramyxoviridae. nipah virus has a mortality rate of 40-90% in humans and close to 100% in experimental animal models . yet, infection of pteropus vampyrus  and p. poliocephalus  by a high dose of nipah virus, failed to result in clinical signs of disease  <cit> . other examples of experimental infections of bats including ebola zaire, japanese encephalitis and st. louis encephalitis viruses have not resulted in any symptoms of disease despite the presence of viral rna in tissues  <cit> . experimental infections of p. poliocephalus with nipah virus have demonstrated the presence of serum antibody and viral shedding in the absence of clinical symptoms of disease  <cit> . the only viruses that have been demonstrated to cause clinical symptoms of disease in bats are rabies virus and the closely related australian bat lyssavirus  <cit> . however, results of experimental infections are inconsistent with only a small proportion of bats succumbing to infection, and rates of sero-conversion and virus recovery from tissues were reported to be very low  <cit> . the long co-evolutionary history of bats with viruses has likely resulted in the adaptation of the bats immune system to cope with viral infection. one hypothesis is that the innate immune system rapidly controls viral replication to very low levels that cause no clinical consequences to bats, but still results in viral shedding and subsequent spillover to other species. however, as little information currently exists on any aspect of bat immunology and few bat-specific reagents exist, this hypothesis remains untested.

recent years have seen a surge in the availability of whole genome sequence data. bats were among the organisms sequenced as part of the us national institutes of health -funded mammalian genome project. these genomic resources are an important step forward in identifying the genes that are involved in antiviral immunity in bats and in providing insights into other unique life history characteristics. there are currently two publicly available bat genome sequences: one from the megabat p. vampyrus and a second from the microbat myotis lucifugus. both bat genomes were initially sequenced to low coverage . additionally, the annotations were predominantly based upon comparative data. despite these shortcomings, these projects have an important role to play in revealing the mechanisms that have evolved to allow bats to remain asymptomatic to so many viral diseases.

in order to understand bat-virus interactions, we are developing the australian black flying fox, p. alecto, as a model bat species. p. alecto belongs to the family pteropodidae and is closely related to p. vampyrus <cit> . these two species are reservoirs for a variety of closely related viruses, the most important of which include the henipaviruses, hendra virus in p. alecto and nipah virus in p. vampyrus <cit> . a number of important resources have now been developed for p. alecto, including cell lines from a variety of tissues  <cit> . we have also begun to identify some of the genes involved in immune responses in this species and carry out functional studies in bat cells  <cit> . to begin to characterise the immune gene repertoire of p. alecto, we sequenced the transcriptome of bat immune tissues and mitogen-stimulated cells using the illumina platform. to our knowledge, this study represents the first analysis of the transcriptome of any species of bat. our analysis of the p. alecto transcriptome provides information on a variety of immune genes not previously identified in any bat species and represents an important starting point for examining the antiviral activity of these molecules.

RESULTS
overview of the bat transcriptome
two separate transcriptomic datasets were generated and raw sequences from each database were submitted to the sequence read archive . the first was obtained using total rna extracted from a juvenile male flying fox thymus. due to its role in central tolerance, the thymus expresses a large proportion of the proteome and therefore allows for the identification of a broad range of genes, including those involved in the immune response. to enrich for sequences corresponding to cytokines and innate immune genes, the second dataset was derived from pooled total rna obtained from mitogen-stimulated spleen, white blood cells and lymph node and unstimulated thymus and bone marrow obtained from one pregnant female and one adult male flying fox. cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide  and ionomycin, which stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines; polyic, a tlr <dig> ligand; pha, which triggers t cell activation and pma, which activates t and b cells.

about  <dig>  million 65 bp long reads were obtained from the thymus dataset, while  <dig>  million 76 bp long reads were generated from the stimulated pooled sample. prior to assembly, the raw reads were trimmed of low quality sequence and polya/t tails, uninformative strings of ‘n’ and primer/adapter contaminants were cleaned. the filtered dataset consisted of  <dig> , <dig> reads from the thymus  and  <dig> , <dig> reads from the stimulated pooled dataset . the filtered reads were de novo assembled using the software packages velvet and oases. the resulting oases assemblies consisted of  <dig>  contigs  from the thymus and  <dig>  contigs  from the pooled samples. the largest contigs in the thymus and pooled samples were  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb respectively, both of which correspond to the dna-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit  which is represented by a  <dig>  kb transcript in other species, including horse. for comparative purposes, an assembly using mira was also generated. summary statistics from the velvet, oases and mira assemblies are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  all subsequent analyses were performed using the oases assemblies.

to identify orthologues of known mammalian protein coding genes, the bat contigs were used to search the kegg and ncbi non-redundant  protein databases with blastx . of the  <dig>  contigs longer than 50 bp in the thymus sequence assembly, about 46% matched annotated proteins in the nr database. for the pooled dataset, about 51% of the  <dig>  loci matched proteins in nr. similar results were obtained for both assembled libraries against the kegg database.

of the assembled thymus transcripts annotated using kegg, 36% of all transcripts were more similar to horse sequences than to any other species, followed by dog  and cow  . similar results were obtained for the pooled tissue dataset . this result is consistent with the now generally accepted view that bats belong within laurasiatheria, which includes carnivora, cetartiodactyla , eulipotyphla , pholidota  and perissodactyla   <cit> . however, until recently, the phylogenetic relationships within laurasiatheria have been controversial. conflicting results have been reported using complete mitochondrial genome sequences to infer phylogenetic relationships with support for a sister relationship between chiroptera and fereungulata  or a relationship between chiroptera and eulipotyphla  <cit> . analysis of the nuclear gene, protamine p <dig>  as well as large genomic datasets, has provided evidence that bats are sister to a clade containing perissodactyla, carnivora, and cetartiodactyla  <cit> . the volume of sequence data generated by transcriptome sequencing provides the opportunity for larger scale sequence comparisons than previously possible using the few full length bat genes available or by comparison with the limited whole genome sequence data. our results support the comparative analysis of retroposon loci which has also demonstrated that bats share a sister relationship with horses, forming a clade with carnivora  <cit> .

alignment of contigs from the thymus and pooled datasets to the kegg database identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs respectively with homology to  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique human proteins. to explore gene function, gene ontology  terms were used. of contigs that matched proteins in the kegg database, 86% were assigned go terms and 78% could be mapped to go slim terms using go term mapper . genes with go slim terms were further classified into twelve selected classes . the most abundant go terms found in the thymus dataset were involved in cell growth and maintenance , enzyme activity , cellular components  and metabolism and energy pathways . similar results were obtained for the pooled tissue dataset . the go classification demonstrates that a diverse range of genes were identified in each of our two datasets providing a broad survey of bat genes.

immune-related transcripts
a goal of the present study was to identify immune transcripts, particularly those that may play a role in antiviral immunity. only  <dig> % of the bat transcribed genes from each of the datasets showed homology to genes associated with immune function. this represents about  <dig> different immune-related genes . the bat immune transcripts were further categorised using go terms to annotate the transcripts into  <dig> immune categories. represented in the datasets were genes involved in a broad range of immune activities with lymphocyte activation, cytokine production and t cell activation making up the largest proportions of immune transcripts . using kegg codes to identify immune genes, our data revealed  <dig> genes involved in toll-like receptor  cascades,  <dig> genes involved in b cell activation,  <dig> involved in t cell activation,  <dig> involved in natural killer cell cytotoxicity and  <dig> involved in antigen presentation. additional immune genes not identified in the kegg database were obtained by searching sequences from the nr database. the sequences of all genes described in the text are provided in the additional file  <dig> 

innate immunity
one hypothesis for the ability of bats to resist the pathological effects of viral infection is that they are able to rapidly control viral replication early in the immune response through innate antiviral mechanisms. the bat transcriptome contained representatives of a variety of immune genes including pattern recognition receptors, interferons, interferon stimulated genes and natural killer cell receptors.

pattern recognition receptors
pattern recognition receptors  including tlrs, rig-i like helicases  and nucleotide oligomerisation domain  like receptors  recognise conserved molecular patterns associated with a broad range of pathogens. both tlrs and rlhs initiate signalling pathways that result in the induction of similar immune and inflammatory responses but are expressed in different locations within the cell and differ in the pathogens they recognise. tlrs are transmembrane proteins expressed by the plasma membrane or endosome and recognise a broad range of pathogens including viruses, bacteria and fungi. of eleven previously identified p. alecto tlr genes  <cit> , only tlr <dig> was absent from the oases assemblies, however it was present in the mira assembly, which used a lower coverage cut-off and is useful for identifying genes with low expression levels. rlhs are expressed in the cytoplasm where they recognise viral rna and dna  <cit> . three bat rlh genes, retinoic-acid-inducible protein i , melanoma-differentiation-associated gene  <dig>  and laboratory of genetics and physiology  <dig>  were identified in our transcriptome datasets and have recently been described in p. alecto <cit> . these results provide further evidence that bats are able to recognise a broad range of pathogens, similar to other species.

nlrs are a diverse family of cytoplasmic prrs involved in the activation of a variety of signalling pathways. nlrs are primarily involved in bacterial recognition, although more recently, evidence for recognition of viral rna and dna by some members of the nlr family has been reported  <cit> . the only nlrs identified in the bat transcriptome datasets were nod-like receptor family card domain containing  <dig>  and nlr family, pyrin domain containing  <dig> . nlrc <dig> is a recently identified nlr proposed to function as a positive and negative regulator of antiviral immune responses  <cit> . nlrp <dig>  is activated by a variety of danger signals including viral and bacterial infections and environmental irritants. activation of nlrp <dig> in turn activates caspase- <dig> in the inflammasome which proteolytically cleaves the cytokines il-1β and il- <dig> into active mature peptides  <cit> . the identification two nlrs with associations with antiviral immunity in the bat transcriptome is remarkable and provides a starting point for understanding the role of nlrs in antiviral immunity in bats.

interferons and interferon stimulated transcripts
the interferon  response is a key component of the innate immune system and the first cytokines induced against viral infection. since the ifn response is important in the control of viral replication in other mammals, we searched the bat transcriptome for ifns and ifn stimulated genes  that may be critical to the ability of bats to remain asymptomatic to viral infections. type i  and iii  ifns are induced directly in response to viral infection and play a role in the earliest stages of the innate immune response. type i  ifn and its receptor  were identified in the bat transcriptome datasets . although type iii ifns, ifnλ <dig> and ifnλ <dig> are up-regulated in stimulated bat cells  <cit> , neither of these genes were identified in our datasets, likely reflecting a low expression level in our samples. the il-10r <dig> chain of the type iii ifn receptor was present in the bat transcriptome, but its partner chain ifnlr <dig> was not found. both il-10r <dig> and ifnlr <dig> were recently described in p. alecto and ifnlr <dig> was demonstrated to act as a functional receptor for ifnλ  <cit> .

the induction of type i and type iii ifns results in the transcription of hundreds of isgs including prrs that detect viral rna, transcription factors that result in the amplification of the ifn response and a small number of proteins that are directly responsible for inducing an antiviral state. the isgs, myxovirus resistance  gtpases, protein kinase r , 2’-5’ oligoadenylate synthetases , ribonuclease l  and isg <dig> are among the proteins with confirmed antiviral activity in other mammals  <cit> . the bat transcriptome datasets contained genes orthologous to mammalian mx <dig>  mx <dig>  oas <dig>  oas <dig>  oas <dig>  oas-like , pkr, rnasel and isg <dig> consistent with the presence of an isg repertoire in bats that is similar to that of other species. these results provide the first evidence that the pathways activated by the ifn response are likely similar in bats to those described in other mammals.

the mx gene family is among the best characterised isgs, first identified as antiviral proteins following the observation that the sensitivity of many inbred mouse strains to orthomyxovirus was solely due to mutations within the mx locus  <cit> . the mx family of gtpases trap essential viral components, and in so doing prevent viral replication at early time points. although the full spectrum of mx antiviral activity is unknown, representatives of both rna and dna viruses have been shown to be sensitive to the effects of mx  <cit> . a full length transcript, encoding a  <dig> amino acid protein was identified in our bat transcriptome datasets and found to be orthologous to mx <dig> based on comparison with known mammalian mx <dig> and mx <dig> family members . bat mx <dig> contained the highly conserved tripartite gtp-binding domain found in all mammalian mx proteins. in addition, a dynamin family signature and putative leucine zipper motif were found near the c terminal end, represented by a stretch of evenly spaced leucine residues. the bat protein was also conserved in the region identified as the stalk of human mxa including loop  <dig> which is associated with antiviral activity. consistent with other species, loop  <dig> of the mxa stalk is the least conserved region of the bat mx protein  <cit> . loop  <dig> has been reported to be proteinase k sensitive and may play a role in lipid binding  <cit>  . bat mx <dig> does not contain the stretch of basic amino acids  near the c terminal end associated with nuclear localisation of mouse mx <dig>  consistent with the bat protein remaining localised within the cytoplasm  <cit> . the conservation of key residues important in antiviral activity is consistent with the bat mx <dig> playing a role in antiviral immunity similar to other species. the identification of the sequences of important isgs will now allow us to determine whether functional differences in the initiation and regulation of these proteins account for the differences in susceptibility of bats to viral infections compared to other mammals.

natural killer cell receptors
natural killer  cells are an important component of the innate immune response, providing a first line of defence against viruses and tumours. to our knowledge, no investigations of nk cell receptors from any species of bat have been reported previously. nk cells express cell surface receptors that recognise major histocompatibility complex  class i or class i like molecules on the surface of cells and lyse infected or abnormal cells by cytotoxicity. two families of nk receptors that bind classical mhc class i ligands have been identified: the killer immunoglobulin like receptors , which are encoded by genes in the leukocyte receptor complex , and the killer cell lectin like receptors , which are encoded by genes in the natural killer complex . different lineages of mammals make use of genes from the two different superfamilies to carry out analogous functions. kirs are used preferentially by primates, cattle, domestic cats, dogs and pigs  <cit> . similarly, the kir-like receptors, marsupial immunoglobulin-like receptors  and chicken immunoglobulin-like receptors , have expanded in marsupials and chickens respectively  <cit> . although chir-ab binds igy, the ligand for the majority of chirs is unknown and the presence of a charged transmembrane residue and a cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif , are consistent with the possibility that they play a role in nk activity  <cit> . rodents, horses and platypus are the only species so far described that have expanded the klrs, represented by the ly <dig> family  <cit> . in the bat transcriptome dataset, no transcripts with homology to kirs or ly <dig> receptors were identified. in bony fish, novel immune type receptors  which contain an n terminal variable domain and a c terminal ig domain have been identified as the primary activating and inhibitory receptors expressed by nk cells  <cit> . nitrs were also used to search the bat transcriptome but failed to identify any orthologous transcripts. the failure to find kir or ly <dig> like receptors in the bat transcriptome may reflect low expression levels of these genes resulting in their absence from our datasets. however, blast searches of the publicly available whole genome sequence of the closely related pteropid bat, p. vampyrus revealed no evidence of kirs or ly <dig> receptors. as this is a low coverage genome , further work is required to determine whether pteropid bats have kir and/or ly <dig> receptors. overall, the absence of these important nk receptors from our datasets warrants further investigation into the nature of nk cells in bats.

nk cells in a wide range of mammalian species additionally express cd94/nkg <dig>  lectin-like receptor heterodimers. unlike the kir and ly <dig> receptors, which bind  mhc class ia ligands, the cd94/nkg <dig> heterodimer binds the  mhc class ib ligands hla-e and qa- <dig> in humans and mice respectively  <cit> . the cd94/nkg2a heterodimer generates inhibitory signals whereas the cd94/nkg2c heterodimer generates activating signals within nk cells. both cd <dig> and nkg2a were identified in the bat transcriptome, however nkg2c transcripts were not identified, possibly reflecting the low abundance of transcripts of this gene in our datasets. two and  <dig> nkg2a transcripts were identified in the thymus and pooled datasets respectively and six transcripts corresponding to cd <dig> were identified in the pooled dataset. two of the longest nkg2a sequences were aligned with nkg2a and nkg2c sequences from human and mouse. as shown in figure 5a, the bat genes display highest conservation with other nkg2a genes including the presence of conserved itim motifs in their cytoplasmic domains, designated by i/v/l/sxyxxl/v indicating that they are likely functional inhibitory receptors  <cit> . the more divergent nkg2d, which binds mhc class i chain-related genes, mica/b, and the ul <dig> binding proteins  in human  <cit> , was also detected.

two distinct bat cd <dig> contigs were identified, one of which is missing two conserved cysteines in the stalk region, the first of which forms an interchain disulfide bond with nkg <dig> and the second which forms an intrachain disulphide bond. the second bat cd <dig> sequence is missing a conserved cysteine in the extracellular domain that forms an intrachain disulphide bond . the absence of key cysteines in both of the bat cd <dig> sequences may have implications for the formation of heterodimers with nkg <dig> and for the unique folding of the cd <dig> chain. combined with our failure to detect kirs or ly <dig> receptors, our data may provide the first evidence for the presence of atypical nk cell responses in bats. however, confirmation of the nature of the nk response and the composition of receptors used by bat nk cells awaits further investigation.

other nk receptors were also identified in our datasets including cd <dig> which acts as an activating or inhibitory receptor on human and mouse nk cells respectively  <cit>  and the natural cytotoxicity receptors expressed by nk cells. co-receptors including cd <dig> and cd <dig> expressed by subsets of nk cells in other species were also identified in the bat transcriptome. identification of nk cell receptors and co-receptors provides information for the development of reagents to identify bat nk cells and paves the way for further studies of nk cell function during viral infection in bats.

adaptive immunity
genes involved in the adaptive immune system, including mhc class i and ii genes and t and b cell receptors and co-receptors were highly represented in both the thymus and pooled datasets providing evidence that bats have all of the components necessary to mount an adaptive immune response.

major histocompatibility complex class i genes
mhc class i molecules play an important role in the initiation of the adaptive immune response through recognition of endogenously-derived peptides from viruses and other pathogens. in the thymus dataset,  <dig> contigs had homology to mammalian mhc class i proteins, while  <dig> were homologous in the pooled data. other transcripts in the mhc class i antigen-loading and presentation pathway were also identified, including beta-2-microglobulin, transporter associated with antigen processing  <dig> , calnexin and tapasin. class i-related genes were also present in the bat transcriptome dataset including cd1a, cd1b, cd1d, mr <dig>  hfe, fcrn and ulbps, which have a variety of immune and non-immune functions. the presence of ulbps is consistent with the expression of nkg2d, but orthologues of mica/b or mill were not observed. the presence of nkg2d suggests bats should have a mic homologue, but these may not be detected possibly due to low or tissue-specific expression. to our knowledge, these sequences provide the first class i and class i-associated transcripts from any species of bat.

of the  <dig> contigs with homology to mhc class i genes in the thymus dataset,  <dig> contained in-frame stops. these may be expressed pseudogenes, represent assembly or sequencing errors or result from reading frame shifts due to the presence of unprocessed transcript. as the sequences were obtained from multiple individuals, it is not possible to confidently distinguish between alternative isoforms, alleles and in some cases, loci. however, clustering the remaining contigs with open reading frames , there are clearly at least  <dig> distinct mhc class i genes expressed. the majority of class i contigs contained the α <dig> or α <dig> domain or partial sequence corresponding to both domains and were used for further sequence analysis. the deduced amino acid sequence of contigs with the most complete α <dig> or α <dig> domains were aligned with human hla-a . all of the bat class i sequences contained a unique three amino acid insertion in the α <dig> domain that appears to be bat specific. as shown in figure  <dig>  the bat transcripts display amino acid variation in their α <dig> and α <dig> domains, corresponding to the peptide binding region. however, they appear to be remarkably conserved from residues  <dig> to  <dig> of the α <dig> domain. these results may indicate that bats contain a very closely related class i gene repertoire that have coevolved with the specific viruses they carry.

some of the class i transcripts represented in the thymus and pooled datasets contained an 84 bp insertion at the end of the α <dig> domain. the longest of these transcripts corresponded to the leader peptide through to  <dig> amino acids of the α <dig> domain and is shown in figure  <dig>  the insertion at the end of the α <dig> domain is not present in class i sequences from other mammals and includes two in frame stop codons that would prevent translation beyond the α <dig> domain . this sequence was confirmed by race pcr and transcripts were detected in a variety of tissues including lymph node, spleen, liver, lung, heart, kidney, small intestine, brain and salivary glands, thus providing evidence that they are not an artefact of the transcriptome assembly . comparison with the closely related p. vampyrus whole genome sequence available in ensembl revealed that the 84 bp insertion is identical to the beginning of intron  <dig> of a p. vampyrus class i gene. mhc class i splice variants that retain intron sequence and result in the translation of a truncated protein have been identified in other mammals, including soluble splice variants of human hla-g that plays a role in immunoregulation at the feotal-maternal interface  <cit> . further investigation will be required to determine whether the bat gene encodes a soluble protein corresponding only to the α <dig> domain or whether it represents a transcribed pseudogene. however, given the abundance of this transcript in our datasets it is possible that it plays a role in immune regulation in p. alecto.

major histocompatibility complex class ii genes
unlike class i molecules, which are ubiquitously expressed, class ii molecules are expressed only by antigen presenting and b cells and present exogenously derived peptides to t cells. the mhc class ii molecules are composed of an α and a β chain encoded by a and b genes respectively  <cit> . eutherians have three main classical class ii gene clusters: dp, dr, and dq, as well as the nonclassical dm and dn/do gene clusters  <cit> . sequences corresponding to exon  <dig> of mhc class ii drb genes have been described in four species of microbats  <cit> . however, prior to the present study no class ii genes have been reported from any species of megabat. sequences corresponding to genes involved in the class ii antigen processing and presentation pathway were also identified in our datasets including the class ii invariant  chain and cathepsin s .

in the p. alecto thymus and pooled datasets we identified  <dig> and  <dig> contigs respectively that were homologous to class ii sequences. phylogenetic analysis revealed that the alpha chain sequences were homologous to dma, doa, dqa and dra from other mammals  and the beta chain sequences were homologous to dmb, dob, dqb and drb . these results are consistent with orthologous relationships between the bat class ii genes and those from other mammals.

t and b cell receptors and co-receptors
t cell receptor  genes corresponding to all four chains of the t cell receptor were present in our datasets, consistent with bats having both αβ and γδ t cells. sequences corresponding to the constant and variable domains of the tcr were identified including many tcrα related contigs, tcrβ related contigs, a few tcrγ and tcrδ chain related contigs. in humans and mice approximately 95% of circulating t cells express the αβ t cell receptor. in contrast, γδ t cells account for up to 70% of circulating t cells in young ruminants, rabbits and chickens  <cit> . the low abundance of tcrγ and tcrδ related transcripts in our datasets is consistent with the possibility that αβ t cells may be the predominant tcr present in bats. in addition, a variety of t cell co-receptors, including the accessory tcrζ chain, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> were identified in our datasets.

we previously described the immunoglobulin heavy chain diversity of p. alecto, revealing the presence of a highly diverse variable region gene repertoire  <cit> . sequences encoding the variable and constant domains of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains were represented in our datasets. these included heavy chain genes encoding iga, igg, igm and ige, which have previously been described in the megabat, cynopterus sphinx. no evidence for the transcription of igd was observed in the p. alecto transcriptome, a result which is consistent with c. sphinx <cit> . the two light chain subtypes, kappa and lambda and a variety of b cell co-receptors including cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd79a and cd79b were also identified in our datasets .

conservation of bat immune genes
many of the bat immune transcripts showed high levels of sequence similarity compared to homologues from other mammals. among the most conserved bat innate immune genes were the prrs; the tlrs, rig-i helicases and nlrs, which displayed >80% amino acid identity with homologues. this likely reflects their roles in the recognition of conserved pathogen motifs. members of the oas family were also highly conserved, in particular oas <dig> which shared 87% amino acid identity with the dog oas <dig> sequence. in addition, the nk co-receptor, cd <dig> shared 93% amino acid identity with mouse, hamster, guinea pig and human sequences. among the adaptive immune genes, mhc associated proteins, calnexin, tap <dig> and cathepsin s shared 89-95% identity with corresponding sequences from other mammals reflecting their conserved roles in the antigen processing and presentation pathway. several members of the mhc class i and ii families were also highly conserved, including cd1b and cd1d which shared  <dig> and 89% amino acid identity with horse and chimp sequences respectively. the bat mhc class ii doa and dra shared  <dig> and 89% amino acid identity with orthologous sequences in other mammals. the t cell co-receptor, cd <dig> shared 90% identity with the rhinoceros cd <dig> sequence and the constant domain of igm shared 92% identity with camel igm.

unannotated transcripts
there were > <dig>  unannotated contigs in the thymus and pooled datasets. only about 3% of these contigs matched predicted cdnas from the p. vampyrus genome sequence, which are annotated using orthologous sequences from other species  <cit> . the unannotated contigs contained a total of  <dig> open reading frames  longer than 300 bp. of these,  <dig> %  aligned to the closely related p. vampyrus whole genome sequence and represent highly divergent homologues or bat specific genes. the remaining loci represent either misassembled contigs or bat-specific transcripts that are located in sequencing gaps in the low coverage p. vampyrus genome sequence. the  <dig> long  orfs were searched for conserved domains using profile hidden markov models with hmmscan  obtained from the pfam database  <cit> . this identified  <dig> orfs containing  <dig> unique domains, including several defensins, antimicrobial peptides and dna-binding domains. searches using domain models from the pfam-b database, identified a further  <dig> unique, predicted-conserved domains in  <dig> orfs. a further  <dig> orfs remained unannotated. a high proportion of these were rich in cysteine, tryptophan and proline, and prolines frequently appeared in low complexity regions . further characterisation of these unannotated transcripts will provide insight into whether they are functionally significant and in particular whether any unique bat specific transcripts are involved in the antiviral immune response.

CONCLUSIONS
bats are a highly diverse, species rich group of mammals that have evolved a variety of distinctive characteristics since their divergence from other mammals  <cit> . despite the central importance of bats in harbouring a variety of viruses with the potential to spillover to other species, very little is known about antiviral immunity in bats. next generation sequencing provides the opportunity to survey genes that are conserved between distantly related species as well as to provide insights into novel adaptations through the identification of previously unidentified transcripts. to identify genes involved in the immune response, we carried out a transcriptome analysis of thymus and immune cells and tissues of the australian black flying fox, p. alecto. this study represents the first survey of expressed bat immune genes and complements existing low coverage bat genome sequences. our analysis provides a broad overview of the bat transcriptome and contains representatives of all of the major classes of immune genes. the results are consistent with bats having all of the components of the immune system present in other mammals. the majority of these correspond to genes that have not previously been described in any species of bat and thus represent an important resource for future investigations into antiviral immunity in bats.
