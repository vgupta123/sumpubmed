BACKGROUND
uk biobank is a resource containing samples and a wide range of data on  <dig>  uk participants. the resource is available for approved researchers to apply to use for the purposes of ‘improving health of future generations’ .

an enhancement project was initiated in  <dig> which aimed to genotype the entire uk biobank cohort using a high density array and subsequent imputation. the majority of participants  were genotyped on the uk biobank axiom® array  <cit> , with  <dig>  participants genotyped on the affymetrix uk bileve axiom® array  <cit> , which has > 95% content overlap with the uk biobank axiom® array.

a bespoke sample processing workflow was designed to ensure the ~ <dig>  samples could be processed to a high quality within 18 months. the pipeline involved three main stages ; preparation of the dna was performed at uk biobank, genotyping at affymetrix and quality control  of the data at the wellcome trust centre for human genetics . the clinical trial service unit  at the university of oxford is responsible for the storage and distribution of the genotype data  to approved researchers.

it is well reported that the concentration obtained from dna quantification can differ significantly dependent upon the dna quantification method used, dna extraction methodology and laboratory . since dna was extracted at uk biobank and genotyped at affymetrix , both laboratories included a method to quantify the dna for qc purposes. this is typical of assays where the dna sample is not extracted in-house.

uk biobank used the trinean dropsense™  <dig> droplet reader in combination with dropplate-s  and affymetrix used picogreen® . this project provided a unique opportunity to compare two commonly used dna quantification methods across a large sample number. a comparison of these two dna quantification methods across two laboratories is presented.

methods
methods below describe the dna extraction/genotyping workflow for the ~ <dig>  uk biobank samples run on the uk biobank axiom® array. further detail on the  <dig>  uk biobank samples run on the uk bileve axiom® array is available elsewhere  <cit> .

uk biobank
selection of source sample for dna extraction
uk biobank participants provide a wide range of biological samples  <cit>  that are aliquotted into 850 μl, 2d bar-coded micro tubes prior to storage. the buffy coat aliquot, derived from  <dig> ml of whole blood collected into an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid  vacutainer, was selected for dna extraction as it was available for the majority of participants and was expected to yield the required 10 ng/μl concentration required for genotyping. saliva was considered but due to the lower number of participants providing this sample type to the uk biobank study, this was not used.

during retrieval of buffy coat samples for dna extraction it was important to maximise the picking speed whilst avoiding clustering of participants by time or date of collection, collection centre, geography , or any participant phenotype . an algorithm was developed to pick the samples in a way that increased the number of assessment centres per plate to reduce potential systematic bias from the way the samples were originally collected and processed that could affect downstream genotyping.

dna extraction
a custom dna extraction system was developed by the tecan integration group   <cit>  to enable dna extraction and quantification in a single process . dna was extracted from 850 μl of buffy coat using a cartridge-based, magnetic bead extraction methodology .fig.  <dig> uk biobank dna extraction system. this system comprises 1) ziath® datapaq high speed single rack scanner zts-a <dig> for sample tracking, 2) two modified hemi-skinned promega maxwell®  <dig> instruments for dna extraction, 3) trinean dropsense™  <dig> for dna quantification, 4) brooks tube auditor™ for volume measurement and 5) liconic stx <dig> automated incubator to keep dna at 4 °c after extraction




dna extraction occurs within the pre-filled cartridge  which is split into wells containing lysis buffer, magnesil™ paramagnetic particles  and wash buffers. briefly, dna is moved between wells by the pmps and the application of a magnetic force to disposable plungers. cells are lysed by a guanidine-based lysis buffer alongside mechanical lysis from the disposable plungers. dna adsorbed by silica coated magnetic beads is moved through a series of wash wells by a plunger. salts from lysis and other impurities that may inhibit downstream processing  are removed during the washing. once purified, dna is eluted from the beads in tris-edta-based lysis buffer, is assisted by heating at 56 °c.

to maximise the dna yield and purity from the source material , the lysis buffer  was increased by 600 μl, the wash buffer  by 1 ml in two wash wells and the cycle through the cartridge was repeated a further two times.

following extraction, the dna was aliquotted across three tubes; one for primary storage at uk biobank , one for back-up storage at uk biobank back-up centre  and one for genotyping . the primary aliquot was quantified on the trinean dropsense™  <dig> 

the quality metrics for a 96-well plate to automatically proceed to genotyping on the axiom® array was 80% of the plate must have a dna concentration > 10 ng/μl. prior to shipping a plate for genotyping, the measured dna concentration and quality  of the stock dna  were assessed from the concentration obtained from the trinean dropsense™  <dig>  results from qc checks were entered into the uk biobank laboratory information management system  and are a data field that can be requested by researchers.

shipment
following dna extraction and quantification, dna was stored at −80 °c. plates were sent for genotyping to the affymetrix research services lab, santa clara, ca, usa  approximately weekly. plates were shipped on dry ice and accompanied by an electronic sample manifest containing an anonymised participant identifier plus the gender, ethnicity and geographical location of the participant to which the sample pertains .

pre-genotyping at affymetrix
genotyping was performed at the arsl as per the manufacturer’s instructions  <cit>  using the uk biobank axiom® array or uk bileve axiom® array.

in summary, samples were thawed and homogenised  prior to picogreen® quantification to establish the volume of dna required for normalisation to a concentration of 10 ng/μl. plates where < 80% of samples had a concentration of > 10 ng/μl required authorisation before proceeding to genotyping. after normalisation, two controls were added to the plate and samples entered the axiom® assay workflow  <cit> . samples failing initial qc  were re-processed. if samples failed re-processing a second sample from the participant was extracted, where available.

data analysis was performed as per manufacturer’s guidelines  <cit> . any deviations from standard protocol are documented in  <cit> .

data qc at wtchg
qc procedures applied to the uk biobank genotyped data are described in  <cit> . upon completion of qc, data is passed to uk biobank for release to approved researchers.

RESULTS
the sample processing workflow described aimed to generate high quality genotypes from as many uk biobank participants as possible. at uk biobank, it was important to design a workflow that generated high quality dna for genotyping on the axiom® array , whilst maintaining a high throughput so data were available within a short timeframe. results are presented for  <dig>  samples. approximately 1% of samples  were excluded from the analysis because dna quantification data was not available from both trinean and picogreen quantification.

success of picking algorithm
the picking algorithm was designed to prevent clustering of phenotypes . the success of the algorithm was assessed by selecting  <dig> plates picked consecutively at the start, middle and end of the project and counting the number of assessment centres represented on each plate. of the  <dig> plates checked, each plate contained samples from participants from at least five assessment centres . this demonstrates the picking algorithm was successful in avoiding clustering of samples by assessment centre and reducing sample bias on the genotyping plate.fig.  <dig> assessment centres per picked plate. number of assessments centres per picked plate from three sets of  <dig> plates from time-points during picking 




success of dna extraction—dna quantity and quality assessment at uk biobank
the novel methodology to extract dna from 850 μl of buffy coat was assessed via the dna concentration and 260/ <dig>  using the trinean dropsense™  <dig> . the average dna concentration was  <dig>  ng/μl  and average 260/ <dig> was  <dig>  . the results from quantification at uk biobank indicated the dna extraction protocol generated good quality dna. from dna quantification performed at uk biobank,  <dig> % of samples fell outside the required 10 ng/μl threshold for automatic pass into the genotyping process.fig.  <dig> dna quality assessed by 260/ <dig>  spread of 260/ <dig> values across  <dig>  dna samples 




dna quantification—comparison of methods
this project provided a unique opportunity to compare two methods of dna quantification across a large number of samples. dna concentration measured via the uv/vis on the trinean dropsense™  <dig> during dna extraction at uk biobank were exported alongside the picogreen® derived concentrations included in the summary metrics from affymetrix for each sample from the uk biobank lims.

out of the  <dig>  samples where data were available from both quantification methods, the average dna concentration measured using the trinean dropsense™  <dig> was  <dig>  ng/μl  and via picogreen® was  <dig>  ng/μl .fig.  <dig> dna concentration measured by uv/vis  and picogreen®. spread of dna concentration in  <dig>  samples quantified using trinean dropsense™  <dig> and picogreen®




correlation of the two methods was assessed between the dna concentration obtained from trinean dropsense™  <dig> and picogreen® quantification methods from  <dig>  samples . some samples were excluded from the analysis  as there was > 60 ng/μl difference between the dna concentration measured by uv/vis and picogreen quantification methods. this difference in a small number of samples can be explained by the lack of homogeneity in some of the dna samples. the dna samples were quantified by uv/vis immediately after extraction; it is expected that the dna is largely homogenous at this stage as it has recently been eluted using a combination of mechanical mixing with a plunger and heat . conversely, picogreen® quantification was performed after storage at −80 °c, shipping on dry ice and homogenisation by heating. it is possible that a small number of viscous samples were heterogeneous during one or both of the dna quantifications resulting in large differences in the measured dna concentrations  <cit> .fig.  <dig> correlation between uv/vis  and picogreen® methods of dna quantification. correlation between dna concentration measured via trinean dropsense™  <dig> and picogreen® quantification methods in  <dig>  samples 




additionally, there were a small number of samples where one method quantified the dna near 0 ng/μl and the other method quantified dna > 10 ng/μl . the most likely explanation for the difference would be failure to transfer dna to the quantification plate in one of the quantification methods during automation.

the correlation demonstrates that whilst others have observed differences between dna concentration methodologies  <cit> , the preparation of dna as described in this paper yields similar dna concentrations whether measured using a uv/vis method  or via picogreen®. the findings from this comparison may assist other laboratories when considering the sample workflow and whether repeat dna quantifications of the same sample are required.

success of genotyping on axiom® array
results from dna concentration checks at uk biobank indicated that the majority of samples would meet the requirements for genotyping of dna concentration > 10 ng/μl and 260/280 >  <dig>  . results from genotyping  for  <dig>  samples  demonstrate the dna generated from the workflow described is of high quality and is suitable for downstream genetic analysis; axiom genotyping in this case.

the average dna concentration of the  <dig> failed samples was  <dig>  ng/μl  and  <dig>  ng/μl  compared with  <dig>  ng/μl and  <dig>  ng/μl  for samples that passed. the average 260/ <dig> of failed samples was  <dig>  and  <dig>  for samples that passed. dna concentration metrics from pass and fail samples do not demonstrate that dna quantity or quality was not responsible for the small percentage of failures at the genotyping step.

CONCLUSIONS
the uk biobank genotyping project was established to generate genotype data from as many of the  <dig>  participants as possible. data from  <dig>  participants is already available to approved uk biobank researchers and will be followed in  <dig> by the data from the remaining participants upon completion of qc and imputation by wtchg.

the sample processing workflow described has generated high quality dna for the uk biobank genotyping project and for use in future uk biobank projects. the comparison between dna quantification has demonstrated trinean dropsense™  <dig> quantification performed at uk biobank and picogreen® performed at affymetrix generates similar results  which may be improved further by thorough optimisation of the dna homogenisation protocol following thawing. the correlation between dna concentration derived from uv/vis and picogreen® quantification methods in this workflow suggests, in large-scale genetic studies involving two or more laboratories, it may be possible to remove repeat dna quantification steps without affecting downstream analyses. it is recommended that during the early phases of a project, the correlation between quantification methods employed in each laboratory is assessed with the aim of removing one of the quantification measures if the correlation is good. removing a quantification step in the workflow would lead to increased throughput, a decrease in consumable costs and a reduction in staff required which would ultimately allow for generation of genetic data faster and cheaper.
