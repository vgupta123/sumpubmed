BACKGROUND
plants have a variety of defense mechanisms to protect themselves from adverse environmental effects. families of transcription factors are involved in these processes by functioning to reorganize gene expression patterns. the wrky family is among them and plays key roles in modulating genes expression during plant defense in response to pathogens  <cit> . the wrky transcription factors were first identified in sweet potato  as dna binding proteins  <cit> . two similar genes  were found in wheat during germination  <cit> . subsequently, rushton et al.  <cit>  reported the identification and characterization of wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> from parsley  and proposed these genes belong to a gene family. this gene family was named wrky due to a conserved region  that was identified in the n-terminal amino acid sequence of all the members  <cit> . further studies showed that the conserved wrky domain had other forms such as wrkygkk and wrkygek  <cit> , or the wrky domain could be replaced by wkky, wkry, wsky, wiky, wric, wrmc, wrry or wvky  <cit> .

according to variation in wrky domain and a zinc finger motif in the c-terminus, wrky proteins were divided into four groups  <cit> . wrky proteins with two wrky domains composed group i. groups ii and iii were characterized by a single wrky domain. group ii wrky proteins were further subdivided into five or more subgroups based on short conserved structural motifs while group iii proteins contained a variant zinc-finger which ends with hxc. finally, group iv wrky proteins contained the wrky domain, but lack a complete zinc-finger structure in the c-terminus. wrky proteins usually functioned as transcriptional regulators via binding to w-boxes  in the promoter regions of down-stream genes and clusters of w-boxes had an amplified effect  <cit> . however, some other studies have found that some wrky proteins bind to the pre <dig> element , sure element  or sure-like element and the wk box   <cit> .

wrky proteins have been found to play essential roles in pathogen defense in response to bacteria  <cit> , fungi  <cit> , and viruses  <cit> . evidence also supported that wrky transcription factors were involved in modulating gene expression in plants during abiotic stresses such as cold  <cit> , salt  <cit>  and drought  <cit> . besides roles in response to biotic and abiotic stress, wrky proteins were also implicated in processes that modulate plant developmental processes such as morphogenesis of trichomes and embryos, senescence, dormancy, and metabolic pathways  <cit> .

grape is one of the most important fruit crops worldwide. the productivity of grapevines is largely limited by disease pressure and stressful fluctuations in environmental conditions. due to their essential role in the early response to pathogens and abiotic stresses, several wrky genes were intensively studied in grape. vvwrky <dig> and vvwrky <dig>  isolated from grape  berries, were found to potentially participate in defending against fungal pathogens  <cit> . vvwrky <dig> was found involving in enhanced protection against botrytis cinerea by transactivating the vvltp <dig> promoter  <cit> , and vvwrky <dig> may regulate lignification and response to biotic or abiotic stresses in grapevine  <cit> . vpwrky <dig> and vpwrky <dig>  isolated from chinese wild v. pseudoreticulata, may contribute to resistance to powdery mildew  and tolerance to salt and cold stresses in grape  <cit> . vpwrky <dig> was found to be involved in pathogen defense and also interact with the salicylic acid, ethylene, and abscisic acid signal pathways  <cit> . transgenetic arabidopsis plants expressing vvwrky <dig>  isolated from ‘beifeng’, an interspecific cultivar of v. thunbergii × v. vinifera, showed increased dehydration tolerance  <cit> . its homologous gene, vpwrky <dig>  was found to serve as a negative regulator of disease resistance  <cit> . although several individual wrky genes have been identified in grapevine, the wrky gene family in grapevine remains wholly uncharacterized.

based on our previous transriptome analysis, we found that some wrky genes respond to cold stress in different patterns in v. amurensis  and v. vinifera cv. muscat hamburg  <cit> . vvwrky <dig>  and vvwrky <dig>  were found up-regulated over  <dig> fold in v. amurensis after being subjected to cold stress but up-regulated to a lesser extent in v. vinifera. in contrast, the expression of vvwrky <dig>  was up-regulated in v. vinifera  while expression remained low in v. amurensis. these different gene expression patterns in response to cold stress may be contribute to the distinctive cold hardiness between the two species. to further characterize how wrky genes respond to freezing stress of grapevine, we initiated this study to identify the entire wrky gene family in grapevine based on the published 12× v. vinifera cv. pinot noir  genome sequences  <cit> . a phylogenetic tree was constructed for identified wrky proteins and the gene expression patterns in different tissues of v. vinifera were detected by rt-pcr. wrky genes responding to biotic and abiotic stresses were cross-evaluated by using public gene-chip databases. additionally, real time rt-pcr was used to detect the expression level of vvwrkys under cold treatment and exogenous aba. a comparative analysis was conducted to identify vvwrkys that may participate in cold signal transduction pathways in v. vinifera using microarray data in public databases, our previously reported transcriptome data and qrt-pcr analysis conducted in this study.

RESULTS
identifying of wrky transcription factors in v. vinifera genome
a total of  <dig> transcripts in the v. vinifera genome sequence were identified as possible members of the wrky family. five transcripts were excluded due to a lack of the conserved wrky domain in the predicted amino acid sequences. the remaining  <dig> transcripts were named from vvwrky <dig> to vvwrky <dig> according to their order in the v. vinifera genomic sequence . as for the previously published six wrky proteins in grapes  <cit> , each amino acid sequence was downloaded and blastp was used to find its corresponding wrky loci in the v. vinifera genome.

genes in 12×

‘pinot noir’ genome

the putative genome location of each vvwrky in the grape genome was shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  fifty-eight of the vvwrkys could be mapped to  <dig> of the  <dig> grape chromosomes, with no vvwrkys found on chromosome  <dig>  vvwrky <dig> was putatively located on the ‘chromosome unknown’. wrky transcription factors were not evenly distributed across the chromosomes of the grape genome. there were most abundant on chromosome  <dig>  and chromosome  <dig>  and least abundance on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> .

categorization of vvwrkys basis on conserved wrky domains
the disposition of structural domains in amino acid sequences is an important clue to analyze the evolution and relationship between highly divergent sequences  <cit> . the relationships among the  <dig> wrky proteins were investigated through constructing phylogenetic trees based on multiple alignments of the predicted amino acid sequences of the wrky domains. as shown in figure  <dig>  we classified the  <dig> vvwrky proteins into four large groups according to the results of the phylogenetic analyses. the models of conserved amino acid sequences of wrky domain and zinc-finger structure in four groups were shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  twelve of the wrky proteins contained two complete wrky domains and a c2h2-type zinc finger motif. these proteins constituted group i. the n-terminal wrky domain  and c-terminal wrky domain  of vvwrky <dig>  vvwrky <dig> and vvwrky <dig> were clustered into a same clade in group i. according to eulgem et al.  <cit>  and by using wrky proteins in arabidopsis as references,  <dig> vvwrky in group ii were categorized into five subgroups. three members were found in subgroup iia,  <dig> in iib,  <dig> in iic,  <dig> in iid and  <dig> in iie. group ii was divided into two parts. subgroup iia, iib and iic showed a close relationship with group iii wrky proteins. and subgroups iid and iie belonged to a separate clade which was closely related to group iv. subgroup iic showed higher divergence than the other subgroups. there were also  <dig> wrky proteins in group iii, and  <dig> in group iv which lacked a complete zinc-finger structure.

rt-pcr based transcription levels detection of vvwrkys in different tissues
to investigate if the putative vvwrkys were expressed and assess their transcription levels in grape, we examined the expression of these genes in different grape tissues. among all vvwrkys, we successfully designed and verified  <dig> primer pairs representing all candidate vvwrkys except for vvwrky <dig> . all transcripts can be detected at least in one tissue. nineteen vvwrkys  were found expressed in all tissues used. six vvwrkys  were found only expressed in young tissues. vvwrky <dig> was expressed in the stem apex and young fruit. vvwrky <dig> was found in stem apex, young fruit and root. vvwrky <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were detected in young leaf, stem apex, young fruit and root.

gene-chip based expression analysis of  <dig> vvwrkys under various stresses
although we identified wrky transcription factors from the v. vinifera genome, functions for these genes in response to abiotic and biotic stress remain unknown. using microarray results from publically available data, it was possible to find gene expression data from multiple experimental conditions for several of the grapevine wrky genes. we carefully checked the genes on the ‘genechip vitis vinifera  genome array’  and a total of  <dig> vvwrkys were found on this chip. microarray data related to salinity, water-deficit, peg, cold, aba and pathogen stresses were downloaded and their corresponding probes and the cv  of these genes in each of the microarray experiments were listed in additional file 3: table s <dig>  if the expression of a probe set  is affected by some of the treatments in an experiment, it shows a higher cv ; and vice versa. according to the data, the cv of  <dig> of the  <dig> vvwrkys were over 5% in at least one experiment. the highest cv appeared in vvwrky <dig>  associated with compatible viral diseases in berry experiment in v. vinifera cv. cabernet sauvignon. vvwrky <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> responded to both abiotic and pathogens stresses while vvwrky <dig>   <dig>   <dig> seemed to respond primarily to pathogens stresses.

to test the correlation between the expression patterns of  <dig> vvwrkys and their phylogenetic relationship, a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using the  <dig> stress related experimental datasets . red, black and green elements in the matrix indicate up-, no change- and down-regulated expression of wrky transcription factors, respectively. from the heat map, twenty-six genes were clustered into four clades. carefully analyzing the cluster of expression data in response to abiotic stresses experiments and comparing this with the vvwrkys phylogenetic tree, we found that genes with close phylogenetic relationship were classified into the same clade during hierarchical cluster analysis. the most obvious evidence can be found in clades  <dig> with  <dig> wrky subgroup iid genes , which show similar expression patterns in response to salt, peg and cold stresses. clade  <dig> contained three wrky group i genes and two group iic genes. clade  <dig> was mainly composed by wrky group i and iic and contains a majority of cold stress-related vvwrkys . clade  <dig> only had one gene and that gene was from wrky group iii.

real-time rt-pcr based expression analysis of vvwrkys under cold treatment in v. vinifera
to examine the response of vvwrkys under cold stress in grape, we examined the transcription levels of vvwrkys in shoot apices of ‘muscat hamburg’ under cold-treatment . vvwrky <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were excluded from cold-treated experiment since their ct value of amplification curve were over 35 cycles in the templates of normal and cold-treated shoot apex. detected vvwrkys can be classified into four groups according to expression patterns as shown in figure  <dig> and additional file 5: figure s3: a) sustained up-regulated during cold treatment , b) changed above  <dig> fold with irregular pattern , c) sustained down-regulated  and d) no significant difference . the relative expressions of  <dig> genes  were significantly different as cold treatment. the greatest increase in expression  was found in vvwrky <dig> at 48 h cold treatment. vvwrky <dig> and vvwrky <dig> had the largest up-regulation of greater than  <dig> fold at 8 hours after cold treatment. while vvwrky <dig> was degraded after 24 hours, the expression of vvwrky <dig> demonstrated both up and down regulated with a spike of expression at 48 hours after intensive degradation at 24 hours.

exogenous aba induced accumulation of vvwrkys in v. vinifera
to illustrate how the vvwrkys respond to aba and whether the cold stress related vvwrkys may participate in the aba-dependent cold signal pathway, aba treated grapevine apices were examined using qrt-pcr. vvwrky <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were excluded from this experiment due to their higher ct value . among the  <dig> vvwrkys we detected, twelve vvwrkys were expressed over 2-fold greater within 2 h of exogenous aba treatment . after statistical analyses of qrt-pcr results,  <dig> of them were evaluated to significantly change during exogenous aba treatments. transcripts of vvwrky <dig> showed the greatest increase in expression at  <dig>  h after aba treatments. six other genes showed increases in expression 1 h after exogenous aba treatment .

when the data from the cold and aba experiments were compared,  <dig> of  <dig> genes  that were up-regulated during exogenous aba treatment were also up-regulated under cold treatment . two genes  were greatly up-regulated, over  <dig> fold. the expression levels of the rest of the  <dig> vvwrkys were lower than 2-fold and not significantly changed during exogenous aba treatments .

identification of candidate cold-stress related vvwrkys
previously we reported the changes of the transcriptome during cold-treatments in ‘muscat hamburg’ and identified  <dig> cold-stress related vvwrkys  <cit> . gene-chip based methods also allowed to identify  <dig> cold-stress related vvwrkys <cit> . in order to overcome the deficiencies of determining gene expression from a single technological approach and obtain more reliable results, we compared the data from three different methods. fourteen vvwrkys from our previous transcriptome analysis, ten from publically available gene-chip based data and  <dig> genes from qrt-pcr results  were used. the results were summarized in figure  <dig> and additional file 4: table s <dig>  three vvwrkys  showed identical expression patterns and were found up-regulated over  <dig> fold in at least one time-point under cold-treatment by qrt-pcr . a total of  <dig> vvwrkys were confirmed by two experimental methods . vvwrky <dig> was identified as up-regulated gene under cold treatment only in the gene-chip studies. twenty-two genes that were characterized by qrt-pcr were not supported by the other studies. it is worth mentioning that down-regulated vvwrkys under cold-treatment were only identified by qrt-pcr based method.

discussion
wrky family in grape
considering the important roles that wrky transcription factors play during plant development and in response to various stresses, it is not surprising that we identified so many family members in grapevine. previously,  <dig> wrky genes were found in arabidopsis <cit> ,  <dig> in cucumber  <cit> ,  <dig> in rice  <cit> ,  <dig> in castor bean  <cit> ,  <dig> in brachypodium distachyon <cit>  and  <dig> in maize  <cit> . here we identified  <dig> candidate wrky proteins in v. vinifera and categorized them into four groups.

group i wrky proteins
when compared with wrky family groups, wrkys in primitive plant ancestors giatdia lamblia, dictyostelium discoideum and chlamydomonas reinhardtii closely resembled vitis group i  <cit> . in our study, two domains of vvwrkys in group  <dig> were closely related. a blastp search of eugene. <dig> from an ancient alga species  which has a single wrky domain allowed us to identify  <dig> corresponding wrky homologs in grape and  <dig> of these belonged to group i by map view   <cit> . these data support the hypothesis that the dual wrky domains present in members of group i may be derived from a single wrky domain duplication  <cit> .

group ii wrky proteins
group ii was divided into three parts: subgroup iia + iib, subgroup iic and subgroup iid + iie . subgroup iia + iib belong to the same clade and is sister to the wrkys in group i. interestingly, the presumed function of ctwds in group i for sequence-specific dna binding  <cit>  were more similar to the single wrky domain members in group ii and iii than to the ntwds of group i, this result may indicate that subgroup iia + iib evolved from group i by domain structure loss of the group i ntwd.

group iii wrky proteins
group iii in the phylogenetic tree was most closely related to the very large subgroup iic, which was separately into four clades and seemed to indicate an expansion of the gene family. a thorough search of the plant transcription factor database  indicated that the earliest evolutionary occurrences of group iii genes were those found in ferns . there was no evidence of any sequenced plant species that only contain members of group i and iii but we found in some species with only members of group i and ii, for example in mosses   <cit> , and some gymnosperms  . we speculated that group iii may have evolved from group ii, particularly iic. as group iii wrkys in arabidopsis responded to diverse biotic stresses  <cit> , group iii members may indicate adaptation of early plants to the stressful conditons associated with the colonization of land and subsequent increase in biotic pathogen pressures.

group iv wrky proteins
we found that group iv wrky proteins, which were characterized by the loss of the zinc-finger domain, were in the same clade as subgroups iid + iie. vvwrky <dig> and vvwrky <dig> were duplicated gene pairs according to a whole genome analysis of grapevine gene duplications  <cit> . this might suggest an origin of group iv from subgroups iid + iie. group iv proteins were considered non-functional due to the loss of the zinc-finger domain  <cit> . however, these genes of group iv can be found in all higher plant species as well as in algaes . furthermore, some genes were expressed in rice   <cit>  as were two genes identified in this study . therefore, it remains questionable whether group iv wrkys have biological function in plants.

vvwrkys participate in development and stress-related signal pathways
wrky genes were found to be expressed in many tissues and seem to be involved in regulating plant developmental and physiological processes. transcriptomic analysis of senescence in the flag leaf of wheat demonstrated that wrky transcription factors are greatly up-regulated during the senescence process  <cit> . oswrky <dig> was found to be up-regulated in elongating stems and knockdown mutations in this gene cause plants to produce a semi-dwarf and small seed phenotype caused by reducing cell length  <cit> . moreover, the transcription of ghwrky <dig> was observed abundant in the roots and stems of tobacco and transgenic overexpression lines of these plants displayed faster elongation at the earlier shooting stages  <cit> . here the expression of  <dig> vvwrkys  can be detected in all grape tissues we used, which may indicate its fundamental roles in different cell-types in grape. similar to expression patterns observed in other plant species, vvwrkys were found to be expressed in young tissues such as young leaf, shoot apex, tendril and young fruit.

several numbers of vvwrkys were found activated in more than one type of stress condition . vpwrky <dig>  homologous to vvwrky <dig> was observed to be up-regulated in response to many different sources of stress, including pathogen exposure, salicylic acid, ethylene, cold and drought stress  <cit> . vvwrkys that were up-regulated in response to more than two types of stresses  supported the occurrence of cross-talk between signal transduction pathways in response to different stress conditions in plants  <cit> .

phylogenetic relationships between vvwrky genes suggested that there may be conserved responses of these genes to salt exposure, peg and cold-stress . all members of group iid clustered into one clade with similar expression pattern during these three stress conditions, suggesting the function of these vvwrky proteins may relate to the structures of wrky domains. subgroup iid was identified as a novel cam-binding transcription factor family in plants and their conserved structural motif was a ca2+-dependent cam-binding domain  <cit> . thus the placement of the wrkys in the phylogenetic tree may also help to predict function of new members that belong to certain gene family.

vvwrkys that participate in the cold related signal transduction in grape
three different experimental methods were combined to robustly analyze the response of vvwrky genes to cold stress . results from qrt-pcr demonstrated the greatest number of cold stress-related vvwrkys  while gene-chip based methods identified the least,  <dig> vvwrkys. this difference may be attributed to the method used but is also likely due to differences in the treatment conditions between experiments. during digital gene expression profile  analysis  <cit> , plant material was obtained from 4 h cold treatment at 4°c, whereas in our prt-pcr experiment, we used samples collected at several different time periods . additionally, multiple matched tags were excluded from the final analysis performed by xin et al.  <cit> , which may have reduced the number of identified cold related vvwrkys. finally, gene-chip based methods may bias results due to a lower number of genes with corresponding probes related to the wrky proteins . by integrating the data from different methods, we obtained more reliable results and a total of  <dig> candidate cold tolerance vvwrkys  were identified during our investigation.

according to previous studies, the transcriptional control of plant responses to cold stress can be divided into aba-dependent and aba-independent signal pathways  <cit> . the results of our study also indicated that  <dig> putative cold stress-related vvwrkys can be divided into two groups according to their responses to exogenous aba. three vvwrkys  may participate in an aba-dependent signal pathway and other  <dig> in aba-independent pathway. wrky transcription factors have been identified as key components in the aba signaling pathways  <cit> . in rice, oswrky <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are induced by  in aleurone cells. oswrky <dig> and  <dig> were functional as negative regulators in aba induction of the hva <dig> promoter-beta-glucuronidase construct, while oswrky <dig> and  <dig> synergistically interacted with aba to activate this reporter construct  <cit> . it is still unknown how wrkys participate in the cold stress-related signal pathway and what relationship these genes have with c-repeat binding factor genes , which are critical transcription factors responsible for cold tolerance in plant  <cit> .

the reliability of the identified  <dig> cold–related vvwrkys was also supported by homologous genes in other species. sthp- <dig>  which showed high similarity with vvwrky <dig>  was not present in leaves until november and december in solanum dulcamara <cit> . wrky <dig>  a homolog gene of vvwrky <dig>  was transiently accumulated when leaves and roots were exposure to low temperature in barley  <cit> . bcwrky <dig> showed higher similarity with vvwrky <dig> and responded to low temperatures in pak-choi. constitutive expression of bcwrky <dig> reduced the freezing susceptibility in transgenic tobacco  <cit> . the transcription level of vvwrky <dig> was up-regulated robust under cold treatment. its homolog gene, wrky <dig> was found in banana with a similar expression pattern  <cit> . all these vvwrkys mentioned above were confirmed by at least two set of experiment methods, which provided appropriate candidates to illustrate the roles of wrky protein under low temperature-related signal pathways in grape.

although low-temperature related wrkys were isolated in several species, the mechanism of how wrkys respond to cold signals and regulate the expression of downstream genes is still largely unknown. further work is needed to elucidate the function of these important genes in low-temperature related signal pathways. previously we reported the different expression patterns of wrkys in v. amurensis, a cold-hardness species. the wrky genes identified here from v. vinifera may accelerate the functional analysis of this gene family in v. amurensis. the comprehensive analysis of cold stress-related wrkys in two different vitis species with contrasting cold hardiness phenotypes would certainly help to illustrate the function of wrky genes in conveying cold hardiness in grapevine.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, a total of  <dig> vvwrkys in the v. vinifera genome were identified. the vvwrkys were unevenly distributed in  <dig> of the  <dig> chromosomes. wrky domain based phylogenetic analysis allowed categorizing  <dig> vvwrkys into four large groups. a majority of vvwrkys were found expressed in more than one tissue in v. vinifera. gene-chip based data analysis suggested that a subset of vvwrkys was activated in respond to diverse biotic and abiotic stresses. the transcription level of  <dig> vvwrky genes changed over  <dig> fold after cold induction. a comparative analysis of qrt-pcr results, gene-chip based data and transcriptome analysis allowed us to identify  <dig> vvwrkys that show identical expression patterns during cold treatment at least in two kinds of analyses. these studies not only increase our knowledge of wrky family, but also provide candidate genes for future functional analysis of vvwrkys involved in the low temperature-related signal pathways in grape.
