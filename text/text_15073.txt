BACKGROUND
streptococcus pyogenes  is a common pathogen responsible for a number of human suppurative infections, including pharyngitis, impetigo, pyoderma, erysipelas, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic streptococcal syndrome, scarlet fever, septicemia, pneumonia and meningitis. it also causes non-suppurative sequelae, including acute rheumatic fever, acute glomerulonephritis and acute arthritis  <cit> . scarlet fever, characterized by a sore throat, skin rash and strawberry tongue, is most prevalent in school children aged four to seven years old. this disease was listed as a notifiable disease in taiwan until 2007; as such, all cases of scarlet fever had to be reported to the public heath department. according to our records, however, only 9% of the medical centers, regional hospitals and district hospitals in central taiwan reported cases of scarlet fever to the health authorities between  <dig> and  <dig>  the number of scarlet fever cases is therefore likely to be significantly underreported. scarlet fever outbreaks frequently occur in young children at day-care centers, kindergartens and elementary schools  <cit>  and also occur in adults upon exposure to contaminated food  <cit> .

genotyping bacterial isolates with various methods is frequently used to compare the genetic relatedness of bacterial strains and provides useful information for epidemiological studies. in a previous study, we used emm  sequencing  <cit> , vir typing  <cit>  and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  typing to analyze a collection of streptococcal isolates from scarlet fever patients and used these data to build a dna fingerprint and emm sequence database for long-term disease surveillance  <cit> . vir typing has since been abandoned in our lab because it has lower discriminatory power than pfge and the protocol is difficult to standardize with conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. in contrast, the pfge protocol for s. pyogenes has been standardized in our laboratory, and a second enzyme, sgrai, has been found to replace smai for analysis of strains with dna resistant to smai digestion  <cit> . since pfge is highly discriminative and emm sequencing provides unambiguous sequence information regarding emm type, we adopted these two genotyping methods to characterize streptococcal isolates and build a streptococcus pyogenes dna fingerprint and sequence database for the long-term study of scarlet fever and other streptococcal diseases.

the number of scarlet fever cases in central taiwan fluctuated greatly between  <dig> and  <dig>  relative to the number of scarlet fever occurrences in  <dig>  occurrences increased in  <dig> and doubled in  <dig>  but dramatically dropped in  <dig>  the number of occurrences increased again since  <dig>  in this study, we characterized  <dig>  isolates collected between 2000– <dig> by emm sequencing and pfge. the bacterial genotyping data and the epidemiological data collected via the notifiable disease reporting system ) were used to examine the significant fluctuation in the number of scarlet fever cases between  <dig> and  <dig> 

RESULTS
epidemiological trend of scarlet fever
taiwan is an island country populated by  <dig>  million people, most of whom reside in the western region . the population in northern, central, southern, and eastern areas is  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  million, respectively. nationwide information for all notifiable diseases has been systematically collected since  <dig>  for accurate analysis, the number of confirmed scarlet fever cases was adjusted by multiplying the number of reported cases and the specimen positive rate. the total, adjusted number of confirmed cases throughout the whole country increased from  <dig> cases in  <dig> to  <dig>  in  <dig>  but dramatically dropped to  <dig> in  <dig> . this number increased again in  <dig> and, in  <dig>  reached the high levels seen in  <dig>  however, the number of cases slightly declined again in  <dig>  in central taiwan, the epidemiological trend was similar to the national profile, but fluctuated more dramatically between  <dig> and  <dig>  while the number of scarlet fever cases was  <dig> in  <dig>  this number doubled in  <dig> but then dropped in  <dig> to the levels seen in  <dig> . the number of cases increased again in  <dig> and, in  <dig>  reached the levels seen in  <dig>  the number of cases in  <dig> was greater than that in  <dig> and differed from the national trend. the number of cases in central taiwan accounted for 18% to 24% of cases throughout the whole country.

the profiles of weekly reported cases revealed that scarlet fever was more prevalent in the winter and spring seasons  in 2000– <dig>  however, there was a remarkable decrease in the number of cases in the 6th and 7th weeks . this decrease may be due to the long holiday of the traditional lunar new year and winter break from school, as it is usually from late-january to mid-february . the weekly reported number of scarlet fever cases in  <dig> was mostly higher than the weekly average from  <dig> to  <dig> . in  <dig>  except in the 11th week, the number of weekly reported cases in the first  <dig> weeks was greater than the average. furthermore, the number of cases between the 4th and 9th weeks was even higher than that in  <dig>  after the 16th week, the number of cases in  <dig> was below the overall average and was significantly decreased from the 17th to 24th week . a lower level of reported cases lasted until the first half of year  <dig>  in early  <dig>  a severe acute respiratory syndrome  outbreak occurred in taiwan. there were two stages for the sars epidemic: stage i occurred from late-february to mid-april , with scattered sporadic cases, and stage ii occurred between mid-april and mid-june , with severe nosocomial infections in several hospitals. the dramatic decline of scarlet fever notifications in  <dig> occurred during the stage ii period of the sars epidemic.

distribution of emm types among isolates collected in central taiwan
for each year between  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig> isolates were collected for genotyping in central taiwan . a total of  <dig>  isolates were characterized to investigate the distribution of emm types. in total,  <dig> emm types were identified in the isolates. the five most prevalent emm types, accounting for  <dig> % of the collection, were emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig>  and emm <dig>  . emm <dig> was the predominant type found between 2000– <dig>  accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total isolates in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. it became the predominant type again in  <dig> and  <dig>  accounting for  <dig> % of the isolates in  <dig>  emm <dig> was predominant in  <dig>  emm <dig> was most prevalent in  <dig> and  <dig>  and emm <dig> emerged in  <dig> but was not detected again after  <dig> 

* <dig> emm types: emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig> , st <dig> , st <dig> , stg <dig> , stil <dig> 

pfge and emm genotypes
the  <dig>  s. pyogenes isolates were analyzed by pfge with smai to investigate the clonal relationship among the isolates. there were  <dig> isolates with dna resistant to smai digestion, and their pattern  was referred to as a spys <dig>  pfge-smai type. the  <dig> isolates with the spys <dig>  genotype were further analyzed by digestion with sgrai. the genetic relatedness of the bacterial strains was evaluated by the levels of similarity among the pfge-smai patterns. a dendrogram was constructed using the unweighted pair group method with arithmatic mean  algorithm. the dendrogram revealed that all of the emm <dig> and emm <dig> isolates, as well as the majority of emm <dig> and emm <dig> isolates, were each distributed in a unique cluster. however, the emm <dig> isolates were located in two distinct clusters and two singletons . one of these clusters included  <dig> emm <dig> isolates that were resistant to smai digestion. clustering analysis indicated that isolates with a common emm type were, in general, more closely related than those with different emm types. however, there were a few exceptions. two strains with different emm types  had indistinguishable pfge-smai patterns, and a strain with a stil <dig> type was located within the emm <dig> cluster . stil <dig> is an allele of emm <dig> that lacks the codons encoding the mature m <dig> 7– <dig> residues . sequence analysis suggests that the st <dig> strain could be derived from an emm <dig> strain via emm gene recombination, as the sequence for the first  <dig> codons of the st <dig> gene were identical to that for the emm <dig> gene. two emm <dig> and one emm <dig> isolates were distant from the major emm <dig> and emm <dig> clusters . the  <dig> smai-resistant isolates were identified to be of emm <dig>  emm <dig> or emm <dig> type.

in total,  <dig> emm:pfge-smai genotypes were identified in the  <dig>  isolates. eight major emm:pfge genotypes, emm1:spys <dig>  , emm4:spys <dig>  , emm4:spys <dig>  , emm4:spys <dig>  , emm6:spys <dig>  , emm12:spys <dig>  , emm12:spys <dig>   and emm12:spys <dig>  , made up  <dig> % of the  <dig>  isolates. five of the major emm:pfge genotypes were detected throughout the seven years studied. in contrast, most emm:pfge genotypes lasted for only 1– <dig> years; they emerged in the population and quickly disappeared.

the  <dig> smai-resistant isolates were discriminated by pfge with sgrai into  <dig> emm12:pfge-sgrai,  <dig> emm1:pfge and  <dig> emm58:pfge types. the  <dig> emm <dig> isolates were distributed in two distinct clusters, a and b . strains within cluster a were quite divergent, with the most divergent types sharing only 65% pattern similarity.

distribution of prevalent emm clones over time
in this study, a cluster of strains  having a common emm type and sharing higher pfge pattern similarity than others with different emm types were considered to belong to a common emm clone. the stil <dig> strain is an exception to this, as it shared high pfge pattern similarity with the cluster of emm <dig> strains and was therefore considered to be part of the emm <dig> clone. based on the groupings made by the pfge patterns, six major emm  clones were identified and are shown in figure  <dig>  the emm12* clone represents the emm <dig> strains with dna resistant to smai digestion. the six major emm clones made up  <dig> % of the  <dig>  isolates. the adjusted number of the annual confirmed cases of scarlet fever in central taiwan ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> between  <dig> and  <dig> , and  <dig> to  <dig> isolates were collected each year for genotyping. the number of isolates genotyped was adjusted to the number of annual confirmed cases to investigate the association of the fluctuation of scarlet fever cases and the relative prevalence of the emm clones. as shown in figure  <dig>  the emm12* and emm <dig> clones were the most prevalent in  <dig>  the two clones declined over time and were at their lowest levels in  <dig>  the emm <dig> clone was the most prevalent in  <dig> and the emm <dig> clone was predominant in  <dig> and  <dig>  in  <dig>  although the number of emm12* and emm <dig> clones declined, the number of emm <dig> clones increased significantly. the total number of scarlet fever cases in  <dig> was doubled that in  <dig> and were primarily attributed to an increase in the number of the emm <dig>  emm <dig> and emm <dig> clones. the number of cases in  <dig> was considerably lower than that in  <dig>  likely due to a decline in all major clones except for emm <dig>  the number of cases increased significantly again in  <dig>  and this increase is associated with a dramatic rise in the prevalence of the emm <dig> clone.

discussion
the cases of scarlet fever in central taiwan from  <dig> to  <dig> were caused by s. pyogenes strains with a limited number of emm types . in fact, five prevalent emm types represented  <dig> % of the isolates causing scarlet fever during this time period. of the  <dig> emm types isolated,  <dig> made up  <dig> % of the isolates. these  <dig> types were among the  <dig> most common emm types that caused invasive streptococcal infections in the united states between  <dig> and  <dig>  twelve of these types accounted for  <dig> % of the isolates characterized and were included in the proposed 26-valent vaccine   <cit> .

in our previous work on  <dig> s. pyogenes isolates collected in central taiwan between  <dig> and  <dig>  the five most common emm types in central taiwan remained the same, but the frequency changed in the two time periods, 1996– <dig> and 2000– <dig>  <cit> . however, the prevalence and distribution of emm types could have geographic variation. yan et al.  <cit>  analyzed  <dig> s. pyogenes isolates collected from scarlet fever patients between  <dig> and  <dig> in southern taiwan and found only three emm types among the isolates, with emm <dig> being the most prevalent type. chen and colleagues characterized  <dig> isolates collected between  <dig> and  <dig> in northern taiwan and found that the most frequent emm types were emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig> , stil <dig>  and emm <dig>   <cit> . in our study, the most common emm types in  <dig> isolates collected in the same time period in central taiwan were emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig>  and emm <dig> . stil <dig> was present in northern taiwan, but it was not found in the central region during the same time period. thus, the distribution and frequency of emm types appear to be geographically varied even in such a small country. the geographic variation in the prevalence of emm clones may explain why the epidemiological trend of scarlet fever in  <dig> in central taiwan was different from that in the whole country.

the major emm types were further discriminated into a number of pfge types, and clustering analysis of the pfge patterns suggests that the emm <dig>  emm <dig> and emm <dig> strains belong to a single clone. the emm <dig> strains belong to two major clones and two singletons, and emm <dig> strains belong to one major clone and one singleton . thus, six emm clones caused most  of the scarlet fever cases in central taiwan during the seven year time period. the fluctuation of scarlet fever cases was associated with the shuffling of the prevalent emm clones . the finding that only a few prevalent m  types caused most occurrences of scarlet fever in a specific location in a given year period, as well as the shuffling of predominant m types, has been observed in many epidemiological studies in the early 20th century  <cit> . during major epidemics of streptococcal infections in previous years, only a few serotypes predominated, and the strains were rich in m protein, encapsulated and were highly virulent  <cit> . type-specific immunity was important for preventing re-infection with the same m type. it is thought that the shuffling of predominant m types is due to the type-specific immunity, leading to the decline of infections with certain m types and the emergence of other virulent m types. in the present study, the prevalence of the emm12*, emm <dig> and emm <dig> clones both increased and decreased within one year. in contrast, the emm <dig> and emm <dig> clones persisted throughout the seven year period. this phenomenon may be due to the fact that the emm <dig> and emm <dig> clones produced less m protein and were less virulent than the emm12*, emm <dig> and emm <dig> clones.

the pfge study also indicates that each of the six emm clones has one predominant pfge type, except for the emm <dig> clone, which has two major pfge types . the less prevalent pfge genotypes of each emm clone emerged and quickly disappeared. even some major pfge genotypes, such as spys <dig>  of the emm12* clone, spys <dig>  of the emm <dig> clone and spys <dig>  of the emm <dig> clone, remained prevalent for only 2– <dig> years before declining. however, the spys <dig>  genotype of the emm <dig> clone did not follow this trend, as it was prevalent throughout 2000– <dig> and was most prevalent in  <dig>  if a newly emerging strain can only prosper in a specific location for a few years, then the emm12:spys <dig>  strains isolated during two different time periods should be different. these differences may not be detectable by pfge analysis. whether bacterial isolates that prevail for two periods become genetically diversified is an interesting subject and may be studied by other genotyping methods, such as single nucleotide polymorphism, by virulence gene detection and by antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

the spys <dig>  isolates, with dna resistant to smai digestion, were found in three emm types, suggesting that they have multiple evolutionary origins. of the  <dig> spys <dig>  isolates,  <dig> belonged to the emm <dig> type. the first isolate resistant to smai digestion was identified in central taiwan in  <dig> and was an emm <dig> type. the emm12:spys <dig>  strain was detected for the first time in  <dig>  <cit> . our previous studies indicated that the emm12:spys <dig>  strain is most likely derived from an emm12:spys <dig>  strain by an insertion of a large dna fragment into the genome  <cit> . the large dna segment could have carried the gene responsible for dna methylation and resistance to cleavage by smai. these strains were analyzed with sgrai. clustering analysis of the pfge-sgrai patterns revealed diverse genetic relationships among the emm12:spys <dig>  strains . the high genetic divergence suggests that the emm12:spys <dig>  strains have derived from multiple origins. recently, euler et al.  <cit>  have shown that resistance to smai cleavage is due to the presence of a dna methyltransferase gene, which is carried on a mobile chimeric element that has transposon- and bacteriophage-like characteristics. this mobile element may explain the high genetic diversity among the smai-resistant strains that emerged in such short period of time.

the fluctuation of scarlet fever cases between  <dig> and  <dig> may be partially explained by the shuffling of several prevalent emm clones. however, the dramatic drop in reported cases in  <dig> is difficult to explain. in early  <dig>  taiwan was badly hit by a severe sars outbreak. the sars epidemic in taiwan had two distinct stages, with the beginning in the late-february  and the second ending in mid-june  <cit> . the stage i epidemic occurred from late-february to mid-april  and consisted of only scattered, sporadic cases, with most of the patients having recently traveled to china. in this stage, the disease did not cause much panic and the level of scarlet fever remained high. in stage ii , several clusters of infection occurred via intra-hospital or inter-hospital transmission. enormous panic spread over the whole country after an outbreak of nosocomial infection was confirmed on the 22nd of april. the disease was subsequently transmitted to several hospitals and spread from the north to the south. the number of scarlet fever cases dropped remarkably during this period. because a large portion of the sars infections was associated with hospitals, fear of sars drove people out of hospitals and public places. this fear and the change of people's behavior may have significantly reduced the number of outpatients and the transmission of many infectious diseases, including scarlet fever. in fact, the sars outbreak had a long-term effect on the occurrences of scarlet fever. after the sars epidemic, the number of weekly scarlet fever reports was often lower than the overall average until the first half of  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the occurrences of scarlet fever in central taiwan between  <dig> and  <dig> were primarily caused by six emm clones: emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig> , smai-resistant emm12* , emm <dig>  and emm <dig> . each emm clone had predominant pfge genotype, and most minor genotypes within an emm clone emerged and quickly disappeared. the large fluctuation in the number of scarlet fever cases during this time period can be attributed to the shuffling of several prevalent emm clones and to a sars outbreak in  <dig>
