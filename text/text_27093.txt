BACKGROUND
the human protozoan parasite e. histolytica resides in the large bowel and can persist there for months or even years, causing asymptomatic luminal gut infection. occasionally, e. histolytica trophozoites penetrate the intestinal mucosa, causing amoebic colitis and spread via portal circulation to other organs, most commonly to the liver, where they induce abscess formation.

currently, the factors determining the clinical outcome of e. histolytica infection are unknown, although a number of different hypotheses have been made. host or parasite genetic factors could play a role, but so could the nature of the immune response, as well as concomitant infections or even diet.

the mechanisms and processes that allow entamoeba to penetrate the tissue of its host and induce colitis and liver abscesses are not completely understood. several studies have dealt with the identification of pathogenicity factors of e. histolytica. in particular, the galactose/n-acetyl d-galactosamine-inhibitable  lectins, the cysteine peptidases and amoebapores have been related to pathogenicity . however, these molecules cannot exclusively be responsible for amoebic virulence, because they are found in pathogenic as well as in non-pathogenic e. histolytica isolates. beside the characterization of individual molecules, different approaches comparing the transcriptomes or proteomes of virulent and non-virulent isolates have been performed. in nearly all of these studies, a comparison was made between the pathogenic e. histolytica isolate hm-1:imss and the non-pathogenic isolate rahman  <cit> . hm-1:imss was isolated in  <dig> from a patient with amoebic dysentery, whereas rahman was originally isolated in england  <dig>  from an asymptomatic individual. in contrast to hm-1:imss, rahman does not form liver abscesses in animal models and has a defect in causing amoebic colitis in human colonic xenografts. in addition, a reduced cytotoxicity in vitro for epithelial cellsand a defect in erythrophagocytosis was observed  <cit> . however, due to the high genetic variability of e. histolytica isolates, differences between pathogenic and non-pathogenic isolates might simply reflect inter-isolate variation rather than specific differences linked to virulence.

to circumvent the problem of substantial genetic inter-isolate variation, we have recently analyzed two cell lines derived from the e. histolytica isolate hm-1:imss, called cell line a and cell line b. genetically, both share identity in the highly polymorphic tandem repeat dna sequences tested, but cell line b consistently produces large liver abscesses in a gerbil model of disease, whereas cell line a does not  <cit> .

phenotypic analysis of both cell lines revealed in cell line a an increased hemolytic activity, a lower growth rate, smaller cell size, a reduced cysteine peptidase activity and a lower resistance to nitric oxide stress. proteomic comparison by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis  followed by mass spectrometry, identified a total of  <dig> proteins with higher abundance in cell line a and ten proteins with higher abundance in cell line b. notably, in the case of only two differentially regulated proteins, namely a fe-hydrogenase  <dig> and a c <dig> domain protein, was a differential expression also found on the level of transcription  <cit> .

here we compare the transcriptomes of cell line a and cell line b to get a more complete picture of the biomolecular differences between these cell lines. for this we used a custom 70-mer oligonucleotide-based microarray, previously applied to compare the transcriptomes of rahman and hm-1:imss  <cit> .

our data indicate that there are significant and reproducible transcriptional differences between these cell lines. most differentially expressed genes belong to the family of small gtpases. these are of special interest as putative e. histolytica pathogenicity factors, because most members of the family coding for the aig1-gtpases are upregulated in the pathogenic cell line b. on the other hand, some rab gtpases were found in higher levels in the non-pathogenic cell line a. the determination of the specific expression profiles of the non-pathogenic cell line a and the pathogenic cell line b may help provide new insights into the mechanisms that have enabled e. histolytica to become a pathogen.

RESULTS
the aim of this work is to identify potential pathogenicity factors, by comparing the transcriptional profiles of two genetically related entamoeba histolytica hm-1:imss cell lines with different virulence phenotypes.

both cell lines are derived from the e. histolytica isolate hm-1:imss as both were originally obtained from the american type culture collection  under the catalogue number  <dig>  to examine whether the cells from the two cell lines are genetically related and indeed derived from isolate hm-1:imss, trna-linked short tandem repeat  sequences from six different loci were analyzed  <cit> .

when these cells are used for infection experiments to induce amoebic liver abscesses in gerbils, cell line a produces very small lesions of pin-head size only, whereas cell line b induces significant abscesses affecting up to 30% of the liver  <cit> . the pathogenic phenotype of cell line b appears to be a constant property as it has been maintained without any animal passage for at least five years. the stability of the phenotype was tested routinely every six month.

comparison of the transcriptomes of e. histolytica cell line a and cell line b
to identify differences between cell lines a and b on a molecular level, we compared their transcriptomes. for this study, a custom-made 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray was used containing  <dig> unique genes found in the e. histolytica genome dataset of february  <dig>  the microarray data are deposited in the public database arrayexpress http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress under the accession number e-mexp- <dig> 

using this array and analyzing two biological replicates,  <dig> gene transcripts were detected that show a two-fold or greater difference in expression between cell line a and cell line b. out of these,  <dig> genes were significantly upregulated in the non-pathogenic cell line a and  <dig> genes were transcribed at significantly higher levels in the pathogenic cell line b .

we used quantitative real-time pcr to confirm the differential transcription of  <dig> selected genes that showed at least a three-fold higher level of transcription in one or other cell line. for all  <dig> analyzed genes, the real-time pcr results matched the microarray data .

of the  <dig> differentially transcribed genes,  <dig> could be classified by putative biological function, namely stress response, trafficking/targeting, transporter, signaling, kinases, rna/dna metabolism, cell cycle, cell metabolism, peptidases, lectins, and aig <dig> family proteins. the remaining  <dig> genes were categorized as genes coding for proteins of unknown function in e. histolytica .

altogether,  <dig> of the deduced proteins of the  <dig> identified differentially transcribed genes contain one to eleven transmembrane domains. interestingly, of these, five have no predicted signal peptide or signal anchor sequence, including two of the four aig <dig> transcripts identified .

the majority of the differentially transcribed genes show only a two- to four-fold difference in expression. these include  <dig> genes for cell line a and  <dig> genes for cell line b. only a limited number of genes  show a five-fold or higher differential expression between the cell lines, as determined by microarray analyses and/or real time-pcr. due to their highly significant differential expression , and comparative observation of nearly all other transcripts in the parasite, it is likely that these identified molecules are involved in the large difference in virulence observed between cell lines a and b. three of the highly differentially expressed genes are rab <dig> gtpases, which are transcribed in higher levels in cell line a. this was confirmed using quantitative real-time pcr. here, the differential transcription was between 50- and 740-fold. in addition, two genes coding for c <dig> domain-containing proteins were also expressed in higher levels in cell line a. like the rab proteins, molecules containing a c <dig> domain may be involved in regulating membrane traffic pathways. quantitative real-time pcr indicates that together with one hypothetical protein , a c <dig> domain-containing protein shows the highest differential transcription  of all analyzed genes .

furthermore, transcript levels for a cell surface protease gp <dig>   are also found in much higher levels in cell line a compared to cell line b . within the e. histolytica genome, two gp <dig> genes are present, which are termed ehmp8- <dig>  and ehmp8- <dig>  these molecules show 34% identity to each other and contain both a signal peptide and a transmembrane domain. in contrast to ehmp8- <dig>  the expression of ehmp-8- <dig> is similar in both isolates as indicated by microarray analyses and real-time pcr .

additionally, three transcripts representing hypothetical proteins were found in higher abundances in cell line a. one shows a 50-fold higher expression level in cell line a in comparison to cell line b. this gene encodes for a protein of  <dig> amino acids, and 80% of the protein consists of the amino acids pro, gly, met, tyr and ala. the stretch gyl-ala-tyr-pro-pro-met is present four times within the sequence and homology searches indicates an approximate 50% identity to the n-terminal region of annexins.

in the pathogenic cell line b, six genes coding for hypothetical proteins could be identified that show a 5-fold or higher expression level in comparison to cell line a. for two of the respective proteins, a signal anchor as well as a transmembrane domain could be predicted .

identification of the e. histolytica aig <dig> protein family
the oligonucleotide array that was used in this study covers about 75% of the annotated amoebic genes. it includes oligonucleotides for four putative aig1-gtpase genes, all expressed in higher levels in the pathogenic cell line b . basic local alignment search tool  analyses indicated that the e. histolytica aig <dig> gene family consists of  <dig> members. the composed list of aig1genes includes  <dig> members where the refseq record was removed from ncbi as a result of standard genome annotation processes . nevertheless, some of the removed genes have been cloned in our laboratory  and the respective sequences were also found in whole genome shotgun reads . the e. histolyticaaig <dig> family members show structural similarity to the gtpases of immunity-associated protein /immune-associated nucleotide-binding protein  family of aig1-like gtpases, which are conserved between vertebrates and angiosperm plants  <cit> . the members of this family comprise 30- <dig> kda proteins, characterized by an aig <dig> domain  and coiled-coil motifs. the gtp-binding motif is composed of the g <dig> to g <dig> sequences and two conserved motifs   <cit> . the e. histolytica aig <dig> family members have a calculated molecular mass between  <dig> and  <dig> kda. most of the amoebic aig <dig> molecules have the first three of the five gtp-binding sites. the cb motif and the ian motif are not present within the amoebic proteins; instead they contain three specific domains, which are conserved throughout the amoebic protein family. as described for the gimap molecules, some amoebic aig <dig> proteins have one or two putative coiled-coil domains. in addition, there is a subgroup that contains one to three c-terminal transmembrane domains. some of the gimap members also contain hydrophobic regions at the c-terminus, which are thought to be involved in membrane anchoring  <cit>  .

transcription profiles of aig <dig> genes in cell line a and cell line b
using quantitative real-time pcr, the transcription profiles of  <dig> aig <dig> genes were analyzed. interestingly,  <dig> of these analyzed genes are transcribed at higher levels in the pathogenic cell line b, whereas only one gene was more highly transcribed in the non-pathogenic cell line a. for three aig <dig> genes, the transcription level was at least 100-fold higher, and for eight genes more than 10-fold higher in cell line b compared to cell line a. the transcription level of the remaining  <dig> genes was similar in the two cell lines .

discussion
in order to identify transcripts that are involved in or even responsible for pathogenicity, we compared two highly related e. histolytica isolates that differ substantially in their pathogenicity. the e. histolytica hm-1:imss cell line b is highly pathogenic and produces large liver abscesses in an animal model, whereas hm-1:imss cell line a appears to have lost its ability to induce abscess formation  <cit> .

the microarray applied in this study had already been used to identify the differences between the non-pathogenic isolate rahman and the pathogenic isolate hm-1:imss  <cit> . using this array, which covers 75% of e. histolytica genes,  <dig> % of the analyzed genes showed a two-fold or greater difference in expression between cell line a and cell line b. only  <dig> % of the genes showed a five-fold and higher differential transcription.

astonishingly, there is only a small overlap between our transcriptomic and proteomic studies that compare the two cell lines. only two genes were fond to be differentially expressed both on a transcript and protein level; fe-hydrogenase  <dig>  at higher abundance in cell line b and one c <dig> domain protein  at a higher abundance in cell line a  <cit> . a similar phenomenon was also observed when comparing the transcriptomes and proteomes of rahman and hm-1:imss with each other  <cit> . davis and colleagues identified only one molecule , where the expression profile was comparable on protein and rna levels. this discrepancy between regulation at the transcript- and proteome level appears therefore to be a general characteristic of entamoeba, indicating that this primordial eukaryote has a more complex way of expression regulation.

the strategy of identifying pathogenicity genes in e. histolytica by comparing pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains has already been used applied by other groups. they compared the pathogenic isolate hm-1:imss and the non-pathogenic isolate rahman using microarray techniques  <cit> . a direct comparison of our results with all three microarray studies exhibits only poor overlaps. of the  <dig> transcripts that were found in higher levels in the pathogenic isolate hm-1:imss in comparison to rahman in microarray study performed by davis and colleagues, only five are expressed in higher levels in the pathogenic cell line b . we identified only one gene expressed at higher rates in the non-pathogenic cell line a  among the  <dig> genes that are expressed in higher levels in rahman compared to hm-1:imss  <cit> .

only  <dig> of the genes found to be differentially expressed between cell line a and cell line b were also found to be regulated in the study of ehrenkaufer and colleagues and only eleven of them are regulated in both studies in the same direction  <cit> . these molecules include one of the two identified c <dig> domain proteins , cell surface gp <dig> , aig family protein  and eight hypothetical proteins .

the low level of consensus between our study comparing two cell lines with the same genetic background and the remaining studies comparing two isolates with a different genetic backgrounds, leads to the assumption that the mechanism that determine the loss of virulence in rahman differs from that observed for hm-1:imss cell line a.

interestingly, only  <dig> of the investigated genes  show a differential expression higher than five-fold between non-pathogenic cell line a and pathogenic cell line b. it can be assumed that genes where the level of respective transcripts differs to such an extent are involved in virulence. one of these molecules is a cell surface protease gp <dig> , which is transcribed at a more than 20-fold higher level in cell line a than in cell line b. in contrast to ehmp8- <dig>  ehmp8- <dig> transcripts are found in similar abundance in both cell lines. in e. histolytica, neither of the gp <dig> proteases  have been characterized. in leishmania, the homolog, named leishmanolysin, occurs predominantly as a heavily-glycosylated protein that is attached to the outer membrane of leishmaniapromastigates by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. it has been demonstrated that leishmanolysin plays a role in resistance of promastigotes to complement-mediated lysis and in receptor-mediated uptake of the parasite by phagocytic host cells  <cit> . it appears that most eukaryotes have homologs of this protein  <cit> .

transcripts of three genes coding for members of the rab <dig> gtpase family  were detected at much higher levels in the non-pathogenic cell line a. rab proteins are essential for the regulation of vesicular trafficking in the endocytic and exocytic/secretory pathways of eukaryotic cells  <cit> . e. histolytica possesses more than  <dig> rab genes and therefore seems to be an organism with extremely diverse and complex rab functions  <cit> . rab <dig> in particular, has been described as one of the most important molecules involved in lysosomal biogenesis  <cit> . in different organisms it plays divergent roles in several distinct steps of endosomal or lysosomal trafficking  <cit> . e. histolytica encodes nine ehrab <dig> isotypes , which show 40-65% identity to each other. it was shown that ehrab7a is associated with the post-golgi compartment and is involved in the fusion of late endosomes. ehrab7b is localized to late endosomes/lysosomes and associated with the formation of lysosomes or the fusion to lysosomes. there is further evidence that all the ehrab <dig> isotypes are sequentially and coordinately involved in phagosome biogenesis  <cit> . in addition, we found that vps <dig>  is also transcribed at higher levels in cell line a . together with vps <dig> and vps <dig>  it forms the amoebic retromer-like complex and functions as a ehrab7a-binding protein. this retromer-like complex is linked to the retrograde transport of putative hydrolase receptors from preparatory vacuoles and phagosomes to the golgi apparatus. nakada-tsukui and colleagues showed that overexpression of ehrab7a caused enlargement of lysosomes and a decrease in cellular cysteine peptidase activity. the reduced cysteine peptidase activity was restored by co-expression of ehvps <dig>  thus, the ehrab7a-mediated transport of cysteine peptidases to phagosomes seems to be regulated by the retromer-like complex  <cit> . as mentioned above, phenotypic characterization of cell line a and cell line b showed a reduced cysteine peptidase activity in cell line a due to a reduced amount of mature ehcp-a <dig> and -a <dig>  <cit> . although, it has been described that the interaction of ehrab7a with the retromer-like complex is specific as no association was observed with other isotypes such as ehrab7b or ehrab7d, an altered expression of molecules involved in vesicular trafficking may be responsible for the observed differences in cysteine peptidase activity  <cit> .

we found two different transcripts of c <dig> domain-containing proteins in higher levels in the non-pathogenic cell line a. the c <dig> domain is a ca2+-dependent membrane-targeting module found in proteins involved in membrane trafficking. both molecules contain one n-terminal c <dig> domain and the c-terminal domains show high similarity to the p <dig> adhesin protein of mycoplasma pneumoniae and to a hypothetical protein of paramecium tetraurelia , respectively. p <dig> is a membrane-bound protein that is oriented with its n-terminus in the cytoplasm and its c-terminus on the cell surface, and is required for cytoadherence. the protein has three types of proline-containing repeats at its carboxy end  <cit> . similar repeats were also found in the c <dig> domain-containing protein of e. histolytica , giving rise to an overall 56% sequence identity. nevertheless, the amoebic molecule seems not to be membrane-anchored, since it does not contain a signal sequence or a transmembrane domain. additionally, the c-terminal region of the second c2-domain containing protein  has a repetitive structure consisting of two main stretches.

in contrast to the transcripts described above, most members of the so far uncharacterized family of putative small gtpases, the aig <dig> proteins, were found in higher levels in the pathogenic cell line b. at least  <dig> genes coding for aig <dig> molecules are present in the e. histolytica genome. quantitative real-time pcr analysis indicates that  <dig> of the  <dig> investigated aig <dig> genes are expressed at higher levels in cell line b. so far, the physiological relevance of these molecules is completely unknown in e. histolytica. they share partial homology to the gimap/ian family molecules of vertebrates. additionally, they have relatives in higher plants but not in most other well studied organisms, including bacteria, nematodes, and the amoeba dictyostelium discoideum  <cit> . nevertheless, aig <dig> genes are also present in the genome of e. invadens, e. dispar and e. moshkovskii, indicating that this family is conserved within the genus entamoeba . structurally, all members of the family contain a gtp-binding cassette and several coiled-coil motifs  <cit> . in the e. histolytica homologs, only a part of the gtp-binding cassette is conserved and coiled-coil motifs are only predicted for some family members. gimap proteins are thought to be regulators of cell death in lymphomyeloid cells. it is suggested that the plant homolog aig <dig> is involved in cell death regulation following self-defence responses to bacterial infection. therefore, gimap proteins might be involved in self-defence machineries common to vertebrates and plants  <cit> . there are two further studies that discuss a link between pathogenicity and expression of aig <dig> genes. davis and colleagues found aig <dig> genes expressed at much higher levels in hm-1:imss than in rahman  <cit> . additionally, the expression of aig <dig> genes was highly regulated in hm-1:imss trophozoites, obtained from a murine model of amoebic colitis. trophozoites isolated from the cecal lumen of mice early in infection  showed either an unregulated or an increased expression of aig <dig> genes. late in the infection , a decrease in the expression was observed  <cit> . although this body of evidence points to an important role of aig <dig> genes for amoebic pathogenicity, their physiological role has to be determined.

CONCLUSIONS
the availability of two syngenic e. histolytica cell lines , which differ constantly in their virulence, provides a powerful tool to identify pathogenicity factors of the causative agent of human amoebiasis. in addition to the proteomes, which have previously been compared between the cell lines, the differences observed in the transcriptomes were analyzed in the present study using microarray technology and quantitative real-time pcr. we identified a set of genes differentially transcribed between the non-pathogenic cell line a and the pathogenic cell line b. most notably, various members of a family of putative aig <dig> gtpase genes are transcribed at higher levels in the pathogenic cell line b, whereas some rab gtpase genes are found in higher abundance in the non-pathogenic cell line a. the identification of transcription profiles unique for amoebic cell lines with specific virulent phenotypes, may aid the understanding of the transcriptional framework of e. histolytica pathogenicity.
