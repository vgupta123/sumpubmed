BACKGROUND
lactic acid bacteria  are not pathogenic and their classification is “generally recognized as safe”. over the past several decades, lab have been used in foods and medicines because they confer beneficial effects on the health of the host. moreover, after their administration, lab are delivered live to the intestine, colonizing the mucosal surface and exerting various effects  <cit> . therefore, lab that produce heterologous proteins have been used as bacterial vectors for the delivery of functional proteins to the intestine. many studies using recombinant dna technology have used lactobacillus species, which are present in large numbers in the human gut and are resistant to gastric and bile acids  <cit> . these live recombinant lactobacilli colonize the intestinal mucosal surface and produce the desired protein  <cit> . although escherichia coli has generally been used for the production of heterologous proteins, coliform lipopolysaccharide  contamination always poses a problem. in contrast to e. coli, lactobacillus species are gram-positive bacteria and consequently do not contain lps. therefore, we selected lactobacillus species for the secretion of functional heterologous proteins.

cholera toxin  is an enterotoxin produced by vibrio cholerae, which is composed of a toxic a subunit  and nontoxic b subunit . ct gains entry to intestinal epithelial cells  when ctb binds to gm <dig> ganglioside, a cell-surface receptor present on mammalian cells. ctb alone can translocate into iecs through the gm <dig> ganglioside without toxicity  <cit> . many groups have reported that recombinant ctb  expressed in various bacteria, yeasts, and plants also binds to gm <dig> ganglioside. previously, we constructed a recombinant lactobacillus casei that secretes ctb, and showed that the rctb secreted by l. casei has gm1-ganglioside-binding activity similar to that of ct from v. cholerae <cit> . recombinant fusion proteins of ctb with functional proteins and peptides, such as vaccine antigens  <cit>  and the insulin b chain peptide  <cit> , have been used as carriers to deliver these proteins and peptides to iecs, because they also bind to gm <dig> ganglioside. however, it has not been determined whether recombinant fusion proteins of ctb with functional proteins or peptides expressed by lactobacillus species bind gm <dig> ganglioside and translocate into iecs.

the synthetic tetrapeptide composed of tyrosine, valine, alanine, and aspartic acid  is a specific inhibitor of caspase- <dig>  <cit> . caspase- <dig> catalyzes the production of interleukin -1β, an inflammatory cytokine, from its precursor , and its overexpression in and secretion from iecs exacerbates intestinal inflammation  <cit> . caspase- <dig> is also produced as an inactive precursor, pro-caspase- <dig>  which is activated by inflammatory stimuli, such as lps and mature caspase- <dig> itself  <cit> . therefore, yvad has anti-inflammatory properties, acting as a decoy substrate for caspase- <dig> instead of pro-il-1β and pro-caspase- <dig>  however, recombinant bacteria expressing or secreting yvad have not been reported because it is difficult to express and secrete recombinant low-molecular-weight peptides in bacteria. furthermore, for yvad to inhibit caspase- <dig> activation and subsequent il-1β secretion, it must be translocated into iecs. however, the cell permeation capacity of yvad is low because of its strong polarity  <cit> . here, we investigated whether fusing rctb to yvad would allow the secretion of recombinant yvad from l. casei and facilitate the translocation of yvad into iecs.

in this study, we constructed l. casei that secretes a recombinant fusion protein of ctb with yvad  and confirmed that rctb–yvad secreted by l. casei binds to gm <dig> ganglioside, translocates into human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma caco- <dig> cells used as a model of iecs, and inhibits the activation of caspase- <dig> and subsequent il-1β secretion from caco- <dig> cells.

RESULTS
secretion of rctb-yvad by l. casei transformed with psctb-yvad
recombinant fusion proteins of ctb with functional peptides expressed in various bacteria  <cit> , yeasts  <cit> , and plants  <cit>  have been reported to bind gm <dig> ganglioside. however, there have been no reports of recombinant fusion proteins of ctb with functional peptides expressed in lactobacillus species. liljegvist et al. reported that the fusion of the serum albumin binding region  to the c-terminus of ctb had no effect on the gm1-ganglioside-binding activity of ctb, whereas this activity was abolished when bb was fused to the n-terminus of ctb  <cit> . these observations demonstrate the importance of fusing the functional peptide to the c-terminus of ctb to retain its gm1-ganglioside-binding activity. in contrast, dertzbaugh and cox reported that ctb can bind to nickel ions without a his-tag because of a specific histidine residue within its sequence  <cit> . however, we recently showed that the purification of rctb with a his-tag from the culture supernatant of l. casei was  <dig> times more efficient than the purification of rctb without a his-tag  <cit> . the gm1-ganglioside-binding activity of rctb with a his-tag, secreted by l. casei, was similar to those of rctb without a his-tag and native ct from v. cholerae <cit> . therefore, to avoid any steric effects on the structure and gm1-ganglioside-binding activity of rctb secreted by l. casei, we fused yvad and the his-tag to the c-terminus of ctb. the rctb–yvad secretion vector psctb–yvad includes the promoter region of the lactate dehydrogenase  gene, the secretory signal sequence  and terminator region  of the β-n-acetylglucosaminidase gene from l. casei, the ctb-coding sequence from v. cholerae, the yvad-coding sequence , and the his-tag-coding sequence in the lactobacillus–e. coli shuttle vector phil <dig>  <cit>  . protein bands of about 12–14 kda were detected in the supernatant of l. casei transformed with psctb–yvad or psctb, when immunoblotted with an antibody directed against ct . these results indicate that rctb–yvad and rctb, with predicted molecular weights of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, were secreted by l. casei transformed with psctb–yvad and psctb, respectively. furthermore, the supernatant of l. casei transformed with psctb–yvad showed strong binding activity to gm <dig> ganglioside compared with that of phil <dig> . this gm1-ganglioside-binding activity was similar to that of the supernatant of l. casei transformed with psctb . these observations indicate that rctb–yvad secreted by l. casei transformed with psctb–yvad has binding activity for gm <dig> ganglioside similar to that of rctb secreted by l. casei transformed with psctb.

purification of rctb–yvad secreted by psctb–yvad-transformed l. casei
to analyze the inhibitory effect of rctb–yvad secreted by l. casei transformed with psctb–yvad, it was necessary to coincubate caco- <dig> cells with l. casei secreting rctb–yvad. however, wild-type l. casei and l. casei transformed with phil <dig>  psctb–yvad, or psctb do not grow in minimum essential medium , which is used to culture caco- <dig> cells, but grow in mrs/k . furthermore, neither rctb–yvad nor rctb was detected in the supernatant of l. casei transformed with psctb–yvad or psctb, respectively, when grown in mem, but both were detected when the transformants were grown in mrs/k . therefore, to analyze the inhibitory effect of rctb–yvad on lps-induced caspase- <dig> activation and subsequent il-1β secretion, we purified rctb–yvad from the culture supernatant of l. casei transformed with psctb–yvad using its his-tag and a nickel-bound affinity resin. the purified rctb–yvad migrated as a single band on sds-page when visualized with coomassie brilliant blue  staining . furthermore, purified rctb–yvad was detected by immunoblotting with an antibody directed against ct  and bound more strongly to gm <dig> ganglioside than did pbs , similar to the supernatant of l. casei transformed with psctb–yvad . the gm1-ganglioside-binding activity of rctb–yvad was similar to that of rctb . purified rctb–yvad and rctb were used in further experiments. about 1 mg of rctb–yvad protein was obtained from one liter of culture supernatant from l. casei transformed with psctb–yvad. this purification efficiency was similar to that for rctb purified from the culture supernatant of psctb-transformed l. casei.

viability of caco- <dig> cells after rctb–yvad and rctb treatment
there were no significant differences in the viability of caco- <dig> cells treated with pbs, rctb-yvad, or rctb in the presence of lps . therefore, rctb–yvad and rctb had no effect on caco- <dig> cell viability in the presence of lps. consequently, rctb–yvad and rctb were used at concentrations of 50 μm in subsequent experiments.

translocation of rctb-yvad and rctb into caco- <dig> cells
the translocation of rctb–yvad is a prerequisite for the inhibition of lps-induced caspase- <dig> activation and subsequent il-1β secretion. therefore, we examined whether rctb–yvad translocates into caco- <dig> cells. rctb–yvad was detected within caco- <dig> cells in the absence or presence of lps . similarly, rctb was detected within caco- <dig> cells. these results indicate that both rctb–yvad and rctb are translocated into caco- <dig> cells, regardless of lps treatment.

the cell permeation of functional peptides, such as vaccine antigens and the insulin b chain peptide, is increased by their fusion with ctb  <cit> , because ctb translocates easily into iecs by binding to gm <dig> ganglioside  <cit> . for yvad to inhibit caspase- <dig> activation and subsequent il-1β secretion, it is necessary for yvad to translocate into caco- <dig> cells. our results suggest that the fusion of ctb to yvad contributed to the translocation of yvad into caco- <dig> cells. the translocation of rctb–yvad into the cells, regardless of the presence or absence of lps, suggests that rctb–yvad translocates into caco- <dig> cells through gm <dig> ganglioside, which is constantly expressed, regardless of the inflammatory status.

inhibitory effect of rctb–yvad on lps-induced caspase- <dig> activation and subsequent il-1β secretion in caco- <dig> cells
the level of caspase- <dig> activity was significantly increased in the lysate of lps-treated caco- <dig> cells compared with that in the untreated control cells . rctb–yvad significantly inhibited lps-induced caspase- <dig> activation compared with that in cells treated with lps + pbs . this observation suggests that rctb-yvad acts as a decoy substrate for caspase- <dig>  the level of il-1β secretion increased in caco- <dig> cells after lps treatment compared with that in the untreated controls . treatment with rctb–yvad significantly reduced lps-induced il-1β secretion compared with that in cells treated with lps + pbs . in contrast, treatment with rctb had no significant effect on lps-induced caspase- <dig> activation  or il-1β secretion  compared with those in cells treated with lps + pbs . these results indicate that rctb had no effect on caspase- <dig> activation or subsequent il-1β secretion, and that the inhibitory effect of yvad on capase- <dig> was not abolished by the fusion of yvad to ctb.

the expression and secretion of yvad by bacteria have been limited by its low molecular weight. therefore, we constructed recombinant l. casei secreting yvad as a fusion protein with ctb and showed that yvad secreted by l. casei inhibits caspase- <dig> activation and subsequent il-1β secretion. the results of this study indicate that yvad secreted by bacteria exerts an anti-inflammatory effect. meng et al. also reported that recombinant green fluorescent protein  fused to the c-terminus of ctb expressed in silkworms emitted green fluorescence similar to that emitted by recombinant gfp alone  <cit> . that report and the results of the present study suggest that the effects of functional peptides or proteins are not abolished by their fusion to the c-terminus of ctb.

CONCLUSIONS
we constructed an l. casei that secretes a recombinant ctb protein fused to yvad. although rctb–yvad bound gm <dig> ganglioside and translocated into caco- <dig> cells, like rctb, rctb–yvad but not rctb inhibited lps-induced caspase- <dig> activation and subsequent il-1β secretion without affecting cell viability. these results indicate not only that a recombinant fusion protein of ctb with a functional peptide secreted by l. casei has gm1-ganglioside-binding activity, but also that recombinant yvad secreted by l. casei exerts an anti-inflammatory effect. the results of this study suggest that rctb secreted by l. casei has potential utility as a system for the delivery of yvad into iecs. however, we were unable to examine the anti-inflammatory effects of rctb–yvad-secreting l. casei in this study because l. casei could not grow or secrete rctb–yvad in mem. we confirmed that it is difficult to completely mimic the intestinal environment in in vitro experiments. therefore, further studies, such as an in vivo study of the ingestion of rctb–yvad secreting l. casei, are required to examine the effects of rctb–yvad-secreting l. casei. if successful, such a study would confirm that rctb-secreting l. casei has potential utility as a delivery system for functional peptides into the intestine.
