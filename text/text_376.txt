BACKGROUND
non-cellulosic polysaccharides from the cell walls of cereal grains are not digested by enzymes resident in the human small intestine, therefore they contribute to total dietary fibre intake  <cit> . dietary fibre reduces the adverse social and personal impacts of serious human health conditions such as colorectal cancer, cardiovascular disease and type ii diabetes  <cit> , and the us food and drugs administration  granted a claim that consumption of whole grain barley and barley–containing products reduces the risk of coronary heart disease, providing they comprise at least  <dig>  grams of soluble fibre per 228 g serving . however the use of barley as a food crop is not particularly common in western civilisations. there is an opportunity to change this and to simultaneously address the global health agenda, through the incorporation of novel barleys or barley products into a wide range of human food staples. this is particularly relevant in northern europe, where the climate and soils are well suited to barley production  <cit> .

the effectiveness of non-cellulosic cell wall polysaccharides, including -β-glucans, in improving health outcomes is related to their levels in grain, to their fine structures, and to their associated physicochemical properties. while most barley varieties contain 3-6% total fibre . within and between species, differences in -β-glucan content can be due to both genetic variation and environmental conditions  <cit> . in barley, -β-glucans are synthesized by members of the cslf and cslh gene families  <cit> . the cslf gene family is comprised of ten members  <cit>  and is part of the cellulose synthase gene superfamily that is responsible for the synthesis of several plant cell wall polysaccharides  <cit> . variation between individual members of the cslf and cslh gene families and/or the genes that regulate them  control the relative abundance and fine structure of -β-glucans in both the grain and the rest of the plant  <cit> . indeed, many of the very high -β-glucan-containing barley accessions have mutations in starch biosynthetic genes, suggesting a regulatory link between starch and -β-glucan content in cereal grains  <cit> . in one class of mutants the link is believed to involve regulation of sugar nucleotide levels in the grain; with adp-glc being the glucose donor for starch biosynthesis, and udp-glc appearing to be the glucose donor supplying -β-glucan synthesis  <cit> . accordingly, over-expressing a cslf gene, under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter, resulted in an almost two-fold increase in -β-glucan content in the transgenic grain  <cit> . other grain constituents were largely unaffected, except for starch, which decreased dramatically in the high -β-glucan lines. grain composition in the model grass brachypodium distachyon provides additional support for a regulatory link between starch and -β-glucan synthesis  <cit> . there, endosperm cell walls are extremely thick, the -β-glucan content of the grain is over 40% by weight and the starch content commensurately lower, at about 6%  <cit> .

a more thorough understanding of the gene families that are responsible for both synthesising and hydrolysing -β-glucan, and how they are regulated in barley and other cereal grains, is highly likely to facilitate innovative approaches to tailoring -β-glucan content and its physicochemical properties to human health benefits. the opportunity for innovation is high, particularly because barley breeding has been traditionally targeted low grain -β-glucan content to reduce viscosity and facilitate filtration during the brewing process. this trait has been the subject of many qtl mapping studies where low grain -β-glucan content was the more desirable state . it seems likely therefore that high grain -β-glucan content may have been intentionally bred out of elite malting quality varieties, with levels of variation in -β-glucan content greater in varieties destined for  the non-malting sector. in support of this,  <cit>  reported a range of grain -β-glucan contents of  <dig> % -  <dig> % in a series of barley cultivars, while values of up to 13% have been reported for wild barley   <cit> . since the fda-backed health claim  was issued, the study of loci associated with grain -β-glucan content has gained an additional dimension, fuelled by these diametrically opposed priorities regarding the preferred levels of grain -β-glucan content depending on the end user market.

here we report the results of a genome wide association scan  of barley grain -β-glucan content. we have previously used gwas to identify genes regulating a range of traits in barley including grain density  <cit> , flowering time  <cit> , and row type  <cit> . however, compared to these traits, which were shown to be controlled by a small number of genes in the germplasm used, grain -β-glucan content is a complex and so-called quantitative trait. using a collection of both spring- and winter-type contemporary barley cultivars, largely originating from north-western europe, combined with a densely populated snp marker platform  <cit> , we show that gwas resolves previously identified qtl with increased precision, and highlights additional genetic regions and candidate genes for follow-up experiments.

RESULTS
grain -β-glucan content
the -β-glucan values in the association/diversity panel ranged from  <dig> % –  <dig> % . correlations between true biological replicates for the spring-type accessions were high  and there were high levels of correlation between the two years for the winter-type accessions . in both sets of germplasm analysis of variance showed that significant variation occurred between accessions , but not between assay batch order or date. the mean grain -β-glucan contents for the spring and winter accessions were  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively.figure  <dig>

population structure
a pcoa showed that the dataset derived from genotyping the elite spring and winter barley types using the 9 k snp iselect platform  <cit>  could be partitioned by both row type and flowering habit , with the 2- row winter and 2- row spring-types comprising the two larger subgroups. therefore, we restricted our gwas to  <dig> 2-row spring and  <dig> 2-row winter lines. the pcoa also illustrates that the 2-row winters are genetically distinct from the 2-row springs, and structure analysis  revealed residual population structure within these two groups. consequently we analysed the winter and spring accessions separately, and fitted an eigenstrat model to account for this residual population structure. in total  <dig>  snps for the winter- type, and  <dig>  snps for the spring type lines distributed across the barley genome satisfied the criteria of having a minimum allele frequency of > <dig>  and less than 5% missing data providing an average marker density of approximately 3– <dig> snps/cm. eigenstrat-adjusted gwas analyses for -β-glucan content in the grain of the spring- and winter–type cultivars are shown in figure  <dig> and the corresponding naïve analyses are provided in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig>

associations with genes involved in -β-glucan synthesis and breakdown
we identified  <dig> significant genome wide associations using an arbitrary threshold of -log10 >  <dig>  with two being found in both populations , five specific to the spring population , and seven associations unique to the winter population  . associations were found between grain -β-glucan content and genetic loci on all barley chromosomes. we identified associations that coincide with the known position of cslf <dig> and glbi, which encodes e <dig> -β-glucanase), on chromosome 1h  and the cluster of cslf genes on chromosome 2h that includes cslf <dig> and cslh . after calculating the fdr, two qtls, qbgn.sw-2h <dig>  and qbgn.w-3h <dig> had an adjusted p value of < <dig>   . surprisingly, we failed to detect any significant associations around the cslf <dig> gene on chromosome 7h which is known to be the primary -β-glucan synthase expressed during grain development. as snp density on the iselect platform is relatively low  and it does not contain any assays within cslf <dig> , we developed a kasp marker based on a g to a snp in the third exon of cslf <dig> that causes an alanine to threonine substitution . genotyping a selection of individuals chosen to reflect the phenotypic extremes for -β-glucan content revealed that all shared the same allele as cv. morex regardless of grain -β-glucan content, indicating that variation at this nucleotide is not diagnostic for this trait within the elite barley germplasm, in agreement with  <cit> . this is not entirely surprising as our unpublished data on the three-dimensional model of the hvcslf <dig> enzyme indicate that the a590t substitution is located far from the active site of the enzyme .table  <dig>

germplasm included in the analysis was a subset of 2-row spring and winter accessions from the uk and northern europe described in  <cit> . peaks with adjusted p values <  <dig>  indicated by **. barley gene id/transcipt , morex contig, developing grain without bracts 5 days post anthesis  and car  <dig> dpa fpkm from . barley gene id/ transcipt . fpkm - fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped. qtl names including s represent associations identified in the spring population, w in the winter population and sw in both populations. eii on 7h is represented by two gene models and therefore transcript expression data is not available. dashes represent those regions were no obvious candidate has been identified for that region based on the available annotations.



we then explored whether genes underlying the remaining associations may be responsible for the degradative re-modelling of -β-glucan, or could potentially act as regulatory genes upstream of genes responsible for -β-glucan turnover. the maximum size of the regions associated with grain -β-glucan content varied between  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm  >  <dig> by  <dig>  cm from each flanking marker, i.e. 5 cm in total– see methods). to characterise these genomic regions we extracted the putative gene contents of each interval  <cit>  and compiled a list of potential candidate genes underlying each of the associations. we then restricted this list to genes annotated as putatively involved in complex carbohydrate metabolism and expressed at the transcriptional level  in the developing grain according to a deep rna-seq dataset  <cit> . this narrowed the set of putative candidate genes considerably . several regions contained glycosyl hydrolase  family members that are known to be capable of hydrolyzing -β-glucan  or glycosyl transferases  that may modify -β-glucan . interestingly, two members of glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig>  -β-glucanases that specifically cleave the -linkages in -β-glucan -β-glucosyl residues), and referred to as isozymes ei and eii encoded by glbi and glbii respectively, are found within region qbgn.s-1h <dig> on 1h, collocating with cslf <dig>  and within region qbgn.s-7h <dig> on 7h. given the surprisingly high frequency of correspondence, we decided to investigate these possible degradative or re-modelling genes further by exploring both their evolutionary and functional relationships.

glycosyl hydrolase  and glycosyl transferase  genes expressed during grain development
we first surveyed the available barley genome sequence assemblies  <cit> , using blast to catalog putative members of different gh families. after removing those sequences that produced unreliable codon alignments  <dig> members of family gh <dig>   <dig> members of family gh <dig>   <dig> members of family gh <dig>   <dig> members of family gh <dig>   <dig> members of family gh <dig>  and  <dig> members of family gh <dig> remained. phylogenetic analysis using bayesian inference divided these families into three primary clades , with all of the gh family members found within regions associated with grain -β-glucan content in the same clade. for all available gene models we then revisited the gene expression atlas  <cit>  to categorise gh gene expression in two grain developmental stages, caryopsis tissue 5 days post anthesis , and caryopsis tissue 15 days post anthesis  . both of these tissues are characterised by extensive cellular differentiation and wall deposition. at  <dig> dpa the multi-nucleate coenocytic endosperm is completing the process of rapid cellularisation providing internal structure to the developing grain. this structure continues to develop by cell division and expansion until maximum fresh weight is achieved at around  <dig> dpa. at  <dig> dpa the endosperm is entering the so-called ‘soft dough stage’, cell walls are thickening, large starch granules are being deposited and the aleurone cells are clearly differentiated. we therefore predict that the expression of -β-glucan synthases and/or hydrolases during either or both developmental stages would impact final -β-glucan content.figure  <dig> 
expression levels  of genes putatively involved in -β-glucan turnover. this includes two different tissues, 5 days post anthesis caryopsis  and  <dig> dpa caryopsis. represented are several glycoside hydrolase  families, of whom at least one member was located in a region identified by gwas as associated with grain -β-glucan content, gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  and gh <dig> , and genes from glycosyl transferases family  <dig>  . dotted lines representing fpkm values for cslf <dig> and cslf <dig> at these two time points are included for comparison. those genes located in regions identified by gwas as being associated with grain -β-glucan content are highlighted with an arrow.



we observed that the expression of cslf <dig>  cslf <dig>  and cslh genes was relatively low  in this dataset) at both developmental stages. cslf <dig> was moderately expressed at 5dpa  and highly expressed  at  <dig> dpa. for the  <dig> glycosyl hydrolase family members,  <dig> had no detectable expression in either of these two developmental stages .  <dig> genes showed low levels  of expression at  <dig> dpa, and  <dig> were expressed at this level in the later developmental stage. the expression of these genes is therefore comparable to that of cslf <dig>  cslf <dig> and cslh in these tissues. the remaining genes showed moderate to high levels of expression in both tissues,  with expression across the two tissues appearing to be generally correlated. we carried out a similar analysis for the barley glycosyl transferase family gt <dig>  identifying  <dig> putative family members in the barley genome including the seven barley -β-glucan synthase-like  genes described by  <cit> . in total  <dig> genes from this subset could be included in the phylogenetic analysis . of these,  <dig> and  <dig> were expressed at  <dig> dpa and  <dig> dpa, respectively, with six showing high levels of expression at both developmental stages .

we then compared the genetic locations of the gh and gt genes that were expressed at 5dpa and/or 15dpa in developing caryopses with the locations on the barley genome associated with grain -β-glucan content in our gwas analysis. eight regions contain members of family gh <dig> , family gh <dig> , family gh <dig>  or family gh <dig> . with the exception of mloc_ <dig>  a gh <dig> at qbgn.w-2h <dig>  mloc_ <dig>  a gh <dig> at qbgn.w-6h <dig>  and glbi, a gh <dig> at qbgn.s-1h <dig>  all showed moderate levels of expression in both stages of grain development. expression data was not available for glbii, a gh <dig>  as this gene’s coding sequence  was split across two gene models. three regions associated with grain -β-glucan content,  contained genes annotated as members of glycosyl transferase family  <dig>  these include hvgsl <dig>  and hvgsl <dig> . all gt <dig> genes present in regions associated with grain -β-glucan content were expressed in both  <dig> dpa and  <dig> dpa caryopses.

discussion
gwas in two collections of elite barley germplasm identified  <dig> significant associations  > 3) between snp markers and grain -β-glucan content, with seven occurring in the spring and nine in the winter population. two of these associations, qbgn.sw-2h <dig> which collocates with the cluster of csl genes on 2h, and qbgn.sw-3h <dig> on the long arm of chromosome 3h, were effectively cross-validated as they were detected in both the spring and winter genepools. qbgn.sw-3h <dig> was also identified in a recent gwas of grain -β-glucan content in the north american barley coordinated agricultural project  germplasm  <cit> . the identification of associations in intervals that coincide with the known positions of the cluster of cslf genes on chromosome 2h and the region on chromosome 1h which includes cslf <dig> and glb <dig>  genes known to be capable of synthesising and breaking down -β-glucan  <cit>  served to validate our gwas approach, while the  <dig> other associations provide interesting new avenues to further our understanding of the synthesis and regulation of grain -β-glucan. further confidence in these associations is provided due to previous expression analyses of cslf and cslh gene family members by qrt-pcr, which identified cslf <dig> and cslf <dig> as the major -β-glucan synthases expressed in various stages of barley grain development, with cslf <dig> and cslh also expressed in this tissue but at very much lower levels  <cit> . in addition to the cslf genes on 1h and 2h, several of the associations identified by gwas occur in the same region as qtl described in previous studies . however, many others appear to be novel.

gwas is often credited with providing greater genetic resolution of regions associated with a trait of interest  compared to bi-parental mapping approaches and here we were able to confirm and refine several previously identified qtls. using a threshold of - log <dig> p ≥  <dig> we were able to attribute many of these relatively narrow qtls to locations that had previously been found to underly a qtl for the same trait  or genes know to influence grain  β- glucan content  <cit> . we also applied a 5% fdr, after which only two qtl retained a highly significant adjusted p-value. however given the degree of qtl cross-validation with independent datasets we suggest this fdr is overly stringent for our dataset. li et al.  <cit>  used a bi-parental population derived from cdc bold and tr <dig> to identify seven qtls associated with grain -β-glucan content. when the centimorgan positions of the map used in  <cit>  were converted to the mxb map positions  <cit>  , qtl3h. <dig> appears to coincide with association peaks qbgn.s-3h <dig> and qbgn.sw-3h <dig> in the current study. the same authors noted that their qtl <dig>  and  <dig>  were likely the same as qtl identified on corresponding chromosomes by both  <cit>  in a cross between steptoe and morex and  <cit>  in a cross between beka and logan. while neither group was able to identify the gene underlying these qtl, the recent publication of the barley genome assembly  <cit>  allows us to make such predictions. thus, these qtl almost certainly coincide with the location of the chromosome 2h cslf gene cluster identified in both the winter and spring genepools in our analysis, and with the location of the cslf <dig> gene on chromosome 7h. furthermore, two of the three grain -β-glucan content qtl identified by szucs et al.  <cit>  in the oregon wolf barley  mapping population were similarly identified here as cslf <dig> on chromosome 1h in the spring germplasm and the csl cluster on chromosome 2h. islamovic et al.  <cit>  identified a qtl for grain -β-glucan content at between  <dig>  –  <dig>  cm on chromosome 6h in a population derived from falcon and azul, which have moderate and high grain -β-glucan content levels respectively. this appears to correspond to the location of association peak qbgn.w-6h <dig> on chromosome 6h in the winter genepool. based on annotations from both barley and rice we observed that this region contains a family gh <dig> enzyme and several transcription factors, which could plausibly regulate -β-glucan synthases or hydrolases. finally, the region underlying qbgn.s-7h <dig> on the long arm of chromosome 7h contained several potential candidate genes based on their annotations. particularly intriguing was sucrose synthase ii  as it has been previously shown that susy supplies udp-glc, the substrate required for the synthesis of cellulose  <cit> , -β-glucans and -β-glucans. it has been proposed that susy could be responsible for channelling udp-glc into -β-glucan synthesis  <cit> . however, as urbanowicz et al.  <cit>  were unable to demonstrate this relationship in vitro, the role of susy in -β-glucan synthesis remains to be conclusively proven. alternatively the association between -β-glucan levels and susy may be related to carbon partitioning between -β-glucan and starch  <cit> .

we were initially somewhat surprised that we failed to identify an association with variation in cslf <dig> as it is well-established as the primary enzyme involved in determining grain -β-glucan biosynthesis, based on the observation that cslf <dig> knockout mutations effectively contain no grain -β-glucan  <cit> . a qtl for grain -β-glucan on 7h attributed to variation in cslf <dig> has been reported in several mapping populations  <cit> . however in several other studies using different mapping populations this qtl has not been observed  <cit> . a survey of regional haplotype diversity across this locus in our association panels indicates that our failure to detect an association may be either because the region is nearing genetic fixation in our elite germplasm, or that effective alleles are present at a low frequency . a further explanation could be that we may simply not have had a sufficiently informative and tightly linked snp marker on our genotyping array. the latter seems unlikely as a kasp assay for cslf <dig> based on a non-synonymous nucleotide substitution showed no association with -β-glucan content. as in many other studies this highlights the difficulty in identifying diagnostic genetic markers that are in tight linkage disequilibrium with natural variants of genes underlying quantitative traits. despite all we know about cslf <dig>  at this time only induced mutations have been shown to have a direct to impact on the -β-glucan content of barley grain  <cit> .

we failed to detect at least two other loci that have been implicated in grain -β-glucan content from recent genetic studies. mezaka et al.  <cit>  mapped -β-glucan content close to the naked  locus using gwas on a small population of lines and the snp genotyping platform described in  <cit> . it is not known if nud directly influences -β-glucan content, however it is possible that the absence of the hull, which will have a very low -β-glucan content, will result in an overall apparent increase in -β-glucan in hulless varieties. no hulless varieties were included in our grain -β-glucan content analysis. finally, chutimanitsakun et al.  <cit> , reported a qtl for grain -β-glucan content associated with granule-bound starch synthase i  at the waxy  locus on the short arm of chromosome 7h . while the precise mechanism for this remains unknown, perturbations in starch metabolism have been shown previously to affect grain -β-glucan content  <cit>  and this observation may represent another natural example of the regulatory link between starch and -β-glucan metabolism  <cit> .

while the hypothesis that grain -β-glucan content is determined by genes that synthesise -β-glucan is persuasive, it is equally valid that allelic variation in genes involved in the breakdown or re-modelling of -β-glucan could also be responsible. based on the combination of genetic co-location and tissue specific gene expression, the current work hints at the potential importance of β-glucan endohydrolases in -β-glucan turnover and thus in determining final grain -β-glucan content . indeed, it is becoming apparent that during the biosynthesis of many cell wall polysaccharides by polysaccharide synthases, genes encoding enzymes capable of hydrolysing the nascent polysaccharide are also expressed  <cit> . whether the hydrolases function to release chains from the synthase enzyme, or somehow trim the newly synthesised chains, is not yet clear  <cit> . in particular, we considered it interesting that qbgn.s-1h <dig> on 1h, and qbgn.s-7h <dig> on 7h, coincide with the known location of glbi and glbii respectively. these encode -β-glucan-specific family gh <dig> -β-glucanases known as isoenzymes ei and eii  <cit> . the commonly known role of these enzymes is to hydrolyse -β-glucan  <cit> , however it has also been suggested that -β-glucanases are involved in -β-glucan synthesis  <cit>  providing a means of editing  <cit>  or dispensing the completed polysaccharide chains after assembly  <cit> . the family gh <dig> gene on chromosomes 3h and the family gh <dig> genes on chromosomes 2h, 5h and 6h are -β-glucanases that can hydrolyse -β-glycosyl linkages in a range of polysaccharides, including cellulose, -β-glucans, -β-xylans and xyloglucans  <cit> . however, -β-glucans are not the preferred substrates for these enzymes and it is not clear whether they are likely to be involved in -β-glucan metabolism in barley. similarly, the family gh <dig> gene on chromosome 3h , which has the highest lod score for a hydrolase and encodes a -β-glucanase designated isoenzyme giii  <cit>  will not hydrolyse -β-glucans and is more likely to function in the removal of callose or in response to a biotic or abiotic stress. at this stage it is difficult to envision how a -β-glucanase might be involved in -β-glucan synthesis or regulation.

the association with the family gh <dig> gene on chromosome 2h is of special interest. this gene encodes an enzyme designated as a xyloglucan xyloglucosyltransferase or xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase . most of the enzymes in the gh <dig> family are of microbial origin, except for the xyloglucan endo-transglycosylases , which are widely distributed in higher plants  <cit> . the xets are known to modify cell wall xyloglucans  <cit>  but can also catalyze transglycosylation reactions involving -β-glucans  <cit> . despite the fact that barley grain has extremely low levels of xyloglucan, this gene is expressed at relatively high levels in  <dig> and 15dap caryopses. it has been proposed that the assembly of -β-glucans requires the action of multiple enzymes  <cit>  in addition to the cslf’s and cslh, and other enzymes implicated in the process include the xets from family gh <dig>  <cit> . thus the gwas analysis reported here could provide additional, non-biased evidence for a possible role for xets in -β-glucan synthesis .

the gwas also revealed associations between grain -β-glucan levels and regions of the genome where family gt <dig> glycosyl transferase genes are located. the gt <dig> genes are variously designated as callose synthase genes  or glucan synthase-like genes . callose is a -β-glucan that is deposited in specialized tissues and cells, such as pollen mother cell walls, pollen tubes, in abscission zones, on sieve plates in phloem of dormant plants, in plasmodesmatal canals and at wound sites  <cit> . although some concerns are still raised about the precise role of gsl proteins in higher plants, the balance of evidence would support their participation in -β-glucan synthesis  <cit> . as noted previously, burton et al.  <cit>  suggested that -β-glucans might be assembled in a two phase process that involves more than one enzyme, and it was proposed that either xets or gt <dig> callose synthases might be involved. we identified strong associations between -β-glucan levels and both an xet and a gt <dig> -β-glucan synthase. the roles of these genes can now be tested as potential determinants of the levels and fine structures of -β-glucans in barley grain.

CONCLUSIONS
premium end users of barley have particular specifications for grain characteristics such as nitrogen content  <cit> , grain size  <cit> , and alpha amylase content  <cit> . in the malting and brewing industries they also require low -β-glucan, but in future applications in human health and nutrition, high levels of -β-glucans are likely to become desirable. the malting and brewing preferences will have shaped the genetic variation present in the elite barley germplasm exploited in our analysis. they will also have largely determined the associations that we identified. pauly and keegstra,  <cit>  discussed the difficulties and complexities of manipulating plant cell wall composition by up- or down-regulating genes known to be involved in the synthesis and degradation of cell wall polymers. despite the observation that single cslf <dig> mutants have no grain -β-glucan suggesting simple genetic control, the mutant plants express a range of defects that indicate an overall lack of fitness  <cit> . this is consistent with both the importance of -β-glucan in barley growth and development and our hypothesis that natural variation in -β-glucan content is the product of a complex regulatory interaction between genes involved in carbohydrate polymer synthesis, re-modelling and breakdown. different suites of genes may be involved in different tissues/cell types, and there is good evidence for an overarching environmental component. while this clearly adds complexity, using contemporary genetics to identify the genes  that contribute to the phenotype will ultimately be useful in tracking and selecting high or low -β-glucan lines in barley improvement programs.
