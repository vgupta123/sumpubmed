BACKGROUND
the nutritional and pharmaceutical potential of plant secondary metabolites is vast and still largely unexplored. many plant species utilized for production of secondary metabolites that are important components of human diet, animal feed, medicines, biopesticides, and bioherbicides, have been subject of limited research and genetic improvement. this is the case of bixa orellana l., achiote in mexico, a species belonging to the bixaceae family within the order malvales  <cit> . bixa orellana is a tropical perennial and ligneous plant of great agroindustrial interest due to its high content of bixin, an apocarotenoid located mainly in the seeds. bixin or annatto is an orange-red pigment that has been used for many years as a dye in foods, such as dairy and bakery products, vegetable oils, and drinks  <cit> . the world demand for annatto is increasing together with the interest in natural food dyes.

carotenoids are yellow to red pigments synthesized by microorganisms and plants. in plants, they accumulate in the plastids  of flowers and fruits. these compounds have antioxidant functions in all organisms, including animals and fungi, and play an important role in protecting cells from damage of radicals such as singlet oxygen  <cit> . carotenoids are the major source of vitamin a  in animals, and abscisic acid  in plants  <cit> . all carotenoids are synthesized by consecutive condensations of isopentenyl diphosphate , which in turn is synthesized through the plastidial methylerythritol phosphate  pathway  <cit> . seven enzymatic steps produce ipp from pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate  <cit> . the first step in carotenoid biosynthesis is the head-to-head condensation of two geranylgeranyl diphosphate  molecules to produce phytoene, catalyzed by phytoene synthase . subsequently, four enzymes convert phytoene to lycopene via phytofluene, zeta-carotene and neurosporene: two desaturases introduce four double bonds , and zeta-carotene desaturase ), and two isomerases acting, respectively, on the 7/9-7′/9′ double bound  and c15-15′ double bonds   <cit> . the cyclization of lycopene denotes a central branch point in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, and the relative activity of epsilon-cyclase  versus beta-cyclase  may determine the flow of carotenoids from lycopene to either α-carotene or β-carotene  <cit> .

apocarotenoids as bixin are derived from the oxidative cleavage of carotenoids, which might occur randomly through photo-oxidation or lipoxygenase co-oxidation  <cit> . at the same time, the enzymatic cleavage of carotenoids through specific carotenoid dioxygenases  has also been proposed  <cit> . bixin is derived from the enzymatic cleavage of lycopene  <cit> . a biosynthetic pathway for bixin has been proposed  <cit>  and supported using a heterologous expression system  <cit> . this identification, however, has not been supported by a full characterization. three b. orellana cdnas encoding the enzymes required for bixin synthesis derived from the linear c <dig> lycopene have been identified: lycopene cleavage dioxygenase , bixin aldehyde dehydrogenase  and norbixin methyltransferase   <cit> .

in spite of the great economic importance of achiote, its transcriptome and the genes from mep and carotenoid pathways remained uncharacterized. before this work, we had only access to partial sequences of some genes  <cit>  obtained from expressed sequences tags  isolated from a subtracted cdna library made with rna from immature seed and leaves  <cit> . the library identified clusters of transcripts corresponding to five genes of the mep pathway: , 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase , 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidyltransferase , 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate synthase ), the intermediate gene geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase , three genes of the carotenoid pathway  and three genes of the bixin pathway , which were overexpressed in immature seeds compared to leaves  <cit> . the limited genetic and molecular data available for b. orellana, is attributable in part to its high amounts of polyphenols, pigments and gummy polysaccharides, which complicate nucleic acid purification. to overcome this difficulty, rodríguez-Ávila and co-workers developed a protocol to isolate total rna from multiple tissues of b. orellana  <cit>  that proved effective for single gene assay expression analysis. here we leverage it together with high throughput sequencing, to assemble a transcriptome for this plant. we demonstrate its use to identify the mep, carotenoid and bixin pathway genes.

RESULTS
de novo sequence assembly of b. orellana transcriptome
to investigate the mep, carotenoid, and bixin pathways genes, we sequenced the transcriptome of b. orellana using mrna from young leaves and two different developmental stages of seeds  . from the isolated mrna we constructed indexed cdna libraries and sequenced them on the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform. the reads were assembled de novo using velvet  <cit> , clc genomics workbench  and cap <dig>  <cit>  software. in a strategy similar to that of ashrafi et al.,  <cit> , separate velvet and clc assemblies were carried out, followed by merging the resulting contigs through cap <dig>  this strategy optimized the number of different cdnas assembled, their overall length and the length of the encoded open reading frames . the final cap <dig> set consisted of  <dig>  contigs with an n <dig> of  <dig>  bp. the average length of the contigs was  <dig>  bp, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp . the contig size distribution showed that  <dig>  contigs  were larger than  <dig>  bp,  <dig> contigs  had a greater length than  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  contigs  were shorter than  <dig>  bp. using orf_finder software from webmga server  <cit> , we performed an orf search in order to determine the approximate number and size of the proteins coded in the transcriptome. a total of  <dig>  orfs ≥  <dig> b were detected, the average length was  <dig> . <dig> b and the longest had  <dig>  b .fig.  <dig>

evolutionary relationship of bixa orellana
in order to elucidate the evolutionary relationship of b. orellana, a phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> proteins encoded by presumed single-copy genes in most plants, identified by duarte and co-workers  <cit> , was carried out. these single-copy genes yielded well-resolved tree topologies  <cit> . the phylogenetic analysis grouped achiote in the malvidae clade, in close relationship with cotton  and cacao  .fig.  <dig> evolutionary relationship of b. orellana.

blast search in public databases
we compared achiote transcriptome  to three protein databases, ncbi plant protein reference sequence , phytozome, and plaza  <dig> , using the blastx algorithm with a cutoff e-value of 1e- <dig>  the search against refseq exhibited a total of  <dig>  contigs  with significant hits, while comparisons against the phytozome and plaza  <dig>  databases showed that  <dig>  contigs  and  <dig>  contigs  had significant hits, respectively. blast hits from the refseq comparison were distributed between  <dig> plant species. eight plant species had ≥ 1 % transcriptome contigs hits . hits obtained by the phytozome comparison were distributed between  <dig> plant species; ten of them had ≥ 1 % transcriptome contigs blast hit . twentyeight plant species were represented in the  <dig>  blast hits obtained by plaza  <dig>  comparison, and  <dig> out of the  <dig> had ≥ 1 % transcriptome contigs blast hit . in all comparisons, cacao  provided the best blast hits:  <dig>  contigs  when the transcriptome was compared with the refseq database,  <dig>  contigs  compared with the phytozome database and  <dig>  contigs  with the plaza  <dig>  database . the second best represented plant species in the blast results was orange  with  <dig> contigs from the refseq comparison and cotton  with  <dig> and  <dig> contigs displayed by phytozome and plaza  <dig>  comparisons, respectively . blastx results for transcriptome comparisons are available in additional file 1: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> blastx top-hits species distribution. the b. orellana transcriptome was compared to:  the ncbi refseq plant protein database,  the phytozome protein database version  <dig>  and  the plaza protein database version  <dig> . the percent of contigs producing hit for each species is marked after the species scientific name



to compare the achiote transcriptome with a previous achiote est library created by jako and co-workers  <cit> , we performed a bidirectional blastn. jako and co-workers library has  <dig> sequences registered, the longest sequence is 691 bp and the shortest is 50 bp with a mean sequence size of 355 bp  <cit> . using the est library as a query, we found that  <dig> est sequences  had blast hits, with an average identity of 99 % and identity range between  <dig>  and 100 % . whereas,  <dig> contigs  had hits to the est library, with a high average identity of  <dig>  %. the identity range was between  <dig>  % and 100 % .

functional annotation of gene ontology
we used the blastx results of the achiote transcriptome against the refseq database to extract gene ontology  terms with blast2go software.  <dig>  contigs  with significant hits out of  <dig>  were annotated and classified in  <dig> go terms. these go terms were split in the three main go categories, “biological process” , “molecular function”  and “cellular component” . in “biological process”, the top three go descriptions from level  <dig> were “cellular process” with  <dig>  contigs, “metabolic process” with  <dig>  contigs and “single-organism process” with  <dig> . in “molecular function”, the largest description was “catalytic activity” with  <dig>  contigs followed by “binding” and “transporter activity”. in reference to the “cellular component” term, the most represented descriptions were “cell”, “organelle” and “membrane” with  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs, respectively .fig.  <dig> gene ontology  annotation. a the top ten go descriptions in the three main categories, biological process, cellular component and molecular function. b contig distribution for terpenoid metabolic process . number of contigs per description are in brackets



with regard to carotenoids biosynthesis,  <dig> contigs from  <dig>  with go annotation were classified in “terpenoid metabolic process” .  <dig> contigs  from this description belong to go term “carotenoid” . the rest of  <dig> contigs included in go: <dig> were split in three descriptions, “diterpenoid”, “triterpenoid”, and “sesquiterpenoid”. go annotation is available in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

kegg pathway annotation
in order to assign biochemical pathways to b. orellana transcriptome, a functional pathway annotation was performed against the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes . the kegg annotation was carried out with the kaas server  by blast comparisons against the kegg genes database. when the file with  <dig>  contigs of transcriptome was uploaded to the server,  <dig> were assigned to  <dig> enzymes. the five main kegg biochemical pathways were represented: metabolism , genetic information processing , organism system , cellular processes  and environmental information processing . in metabolism pathways,  <dig> contigs were distributed in  <dig> hits . the top three groups of metabolism pathways were “carbohydrate metabolism” with  <dig> hits against  <dig> enzymes, followed by “amino acid metabolism” with  <dig> hits in  <dig> enzymes. the third group called “overview”, which included carbon metabolism, 2-oxocarboxylic acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids and degradation of aromatic compounds), had  <dig> hits and  <dig> enzymes.fig.  <dig> kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  annotation. a classification based on metabolism categories. b classification based on metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides. number of contigs per pathway is in brackets



in the terpenoids and polyketides pathways, which include the carotenoid pathways,  <dig> contigs could be associated with  <dig> enzymes . the largest pathway with  <dig> contigs was “terpenoid backbone biosynthesis”, which includes enzymes from the mep and mevalonate pathways. the carotenoid pathway was the second most represented group with  <dig> contigs and  <dig> enzymes. the twelve enzymes belonging to the carotenoid pathway were: psy, pds, 15-z-iso, zds, crtiso, β-lyc, ε-lyc, β-carotene hydroxylase , cytochrome p450-type monooxygenase 97a , cytochrome p450-type monooxygenase 97c <dig> , zeaxanthin epoxidase  and violaxanthin de-epoxidase . the five remaining enzymes are associated to derivate compounds of carotenes: capsanthin/capsorubin synthase , 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase , xanthoxin dehydrogenase , abscisic-aldehyde oxidase  and abscisic acid 8′-hydroxylase. kegg annotation is available in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

identification of mep and carotenoid pathways cdnas from b. orellana transcriptome
to identify and isolate the cdnas encoding proteins of the mep and carotenoid pathway, a local tblastn search against the achiote transcriptome was performed using homologous proteins from arabidopsis thaliana, g. raimondii and t. cacao followed by a phylogenetic analysis of each putative protein. the search allowed us to identify the cdnas encoding the seven canonical enzymes in the mep pathway, the cdnas encoding the  <dig> core enzymes of the carotenoid pathways and the cdnas encoding intermediate pathway proteins isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase  and boggds .table  <dig> identified cdna from mep, carotenoid and bixin pathways

apartial sequence



cdnas encoding putative bodxs in the mep pathway were consistent with four genes: bodxs <dig>  bodxs <dig> and two paralogous copies of bodxs <dig> . we identified cdna consistent with single copy genes for the remaining mep pathway enzymes: bodxr, bomct, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-c-methyl-d-erythritol kinase , 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol  <dig> -cyclodiphosphate synthase , bohds, and 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase . also single copies were identified for the intermediate genes boidi and boggps. comparison to mep pathways cdnas isolated in the previous est library  <cit>  showed that bodxs2a, bodxr <dig>  bocmk, bohds, bohdr and boggds were common .

in the carotenoid pathway, cdnas characterization identified two gene copies for phytoene synthase , phytoene desaturase , β lycopene cyclase , zeaxanthin epoxidase  and violaxanthin de-epoxidase . the remaining carotenoid pathway genes were found in single copy, except crtiso for which three copies were identified: bocrtiso <dig> and paralogous bocrtiso1a and bocrtiso1b . the comparison between carotene pathway cdnas isolated in the jako and co-workers library  <cit>  showed that only the cdnas encoding bopsy <dig>  bopsy <dig>  bopds <dig> and bozds were in common .

in order to elucidate the evolutionary relationship of mep and carotenoid pathways enzymes from b. orellana and other plant species, we carried out a phylogenetic analysis using mega <dig> software. the analysis was based on alignment of concatenated protein sequences from mep and carotenoid pathways of b. orellana and  <dig> plants species. b. orellana was grouped with species from the malvidae clade and was closely related to cotton and cacao, the two malvales species available in sequence databases .

identification of new genes in bixin pathways
to identify and isolate the cdnas encoding enzymes of the bixin pathway, a tblastn search against the achiote transcriptome was performed using the achiote protein sequences previously reported by bouvier and co-workers   <cit> . surprisingly, these three proteins were not present among those encoded by our assembled transcriptome. the bouvier bolcd protein had only one hit with 53 % of identity. bobadh displayed hits with seven contigs with low identity percentages . when bonbmt was compared, several hits with identity range between  <dig> and 49 % were found. on the other hand, our previously described ccd <dig>  <cit>  matched several contigs with high identity . we were also able to identify high quality matches in b. orellana for cdnas encoding carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase  <dig> , aldehyde dehydrogenases  and carboxyl methyltransferases using homologous proteins of a. thaliana and t. cacao.

carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase proteins in bixin synthesis
the contigs similar to the ccd <dig> isolated by rodríguez-Ávila and co-workers  <cit> , allowed the identification of three paralogous copies of the ccd <dig> gene . a pair-wise comparison between ccd <dig> protein sequences showed that the boccd <dig> described by rodríguez-Ávila and co-workers  <cit>  shared  <dig>  % identity with boccd1- <dig>  75 % with boccd1- <dig> and 75 % with boccd1- <dig> . additionally, another ccd <dig> sequence was identified by pcr when boccd1- <dig> sequences were amplified and characterized for corroboration. this new cdnas probably corresponds to an allele of boccd1- <dig> because it shared 97 % of nucleotide identity. the gene was called boccd1- <dig>  boccd1- <dig> protein shared 98 % identity with the ccd <dig> isolated by rodríguez-Ávila and co-workers  <cit>  and 95 % with boccd1- <dig> . no boccd <dig> genes were reported by jako and co-workers   <cit> . comparison of ccd <dig> homologous proteins against those encoded by the assembled achiote transcriptome allowed us to identify five boccd <dig> genes . the pair-wise comparison between these proteins exhibited an identity range between  <dig> to 67 % . the previous ccd <dig> isolated by bouvier and co-workers  <cit>  displayed low identity  in comparison with the proteins coded by our transcriptome . of the five boccd <dig> cdnas characterized in this work, boccd4- <dig> and boccd4- <dig> matched est sequences from jako and co-workers library   <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis of boccds proteins yielded two major clades; boccd <dig> and boccd <dig> clustered with the ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> families, respectively. boccd1- <dig> and − <dig> were closely related to the boccd <dig> described by rodríguez-Ávila and co-workers  <cit> . boccd1- <dig> and − <dig> clustered with monocotyledonous ccd <dig> proteins, albeit with poor bootstrap support. boccd <dig> copy  <dig> and copy  <dig> were not closely related to the boccd <dig> protein described by rodríguez-Ávila and co-workers  <cit> , but grouped together outside the major ccd <dig> clade . with regard to the boccd <dig> proteins, boccd4- <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig> and − <dig> are grouped together . the small boccd <dig> family clustered in a subclade of ccd <dig> proteins from woody plants such as t. cacao, vitis vinifera, and populus trichocarpa. the incomplete sequence of boccd4- <dig>  suggests a more distant relationship to the boccd <dig> small family defined by the previous proteins. boccd4- <dig> is related to the ccd <dig> from ricinus communis, p. trichocarpa, t. cacao and g. raimondii grouped in the other ccd <dig> subclade . the bolcd sequence described by bouvier and co-workers  <cit>  was not closely related to boccd <dig> proteins found in this work, but grouped instead in the monocotyledonous ccd <dig> clade, close to three ccd <dig> from monocotyledonous crocus sativus . this latter clade’s strong support  suggests that their previous attribution to b. orellana by bouvier and co-workers  <cit>  is spurious.

aldehyde dehydrogenase proteins
to identify cdnas encoding boaldhs, we performed tblastn search using t. cacao and a. thaliana homologous aldh proteins from the  <dig> distinct aldh families of plants. this approach succeeded in identifying  <dig> different aldhs cdnas. according to the phylogenetic analysis of boaldh and its homologous proteins, the boaldhs isolated in this work belong to  <dig> aldh families . four boaldh proteins were clustered in the aldh <dig> family, five with aldh <dig>  three with aldh <dig> and two with aldh <dig>  the remaining boaldh proteins grouped with the aldh <dig>  aldh <dig>  aldh <dig>  aldh <dig>  aldh <dig> and aldh <dig> families . bobadh described by bouvier and co-workers  <cit>  was more distant to boaldhs, and closer to the protein from monocotyledonous crocus sativus in subfamily aldh2c <dig> , another possible spurious instance. boaldh3h1- <dig>  boaldh3i and boaldh7b <dig> genes yielded blast hits with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sequences respectively in the jako and co-workers library  <cit>  .

methyltransferases proteins
in order to identify carboxyl methyltransferase proteins encoded by b. orellana transcriptome, we used t. cacao and a. thaliana homologous proteins belonging to the sabath methyltranferase family  to perform a tblastn search. we found  <dig> different proteins . phylogenetic analysis of sabath proteins divided them in three major clades called i, ii and iii , which, however, differed from a previous phylogenetic classification  <cit> . bosabath <dig>  bosabath <dig> and a small group of four bosabath proteins  were grouped in clade i. also, the previously described bonbmt was grouped in this clade, but was not closely related to our bosabath protein. instead, it displayed high similarity to a c. sativus carboxyl methyltransferase. this clade’s strong support  suggests another spurious instance of bonbmt described by bouvier and co-workers  <cit>  . bosabath <dig> was the only one grouped in the small clade ii, for which most members are jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferases. in clade iii, bosabath <dig> was grouped in a subclade formed by ten a. thaliana sabath proteins. additionally, bosabath <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were clustered in clade iii and a small bosabath group was formed by bosabath <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . bosabath <dig> and bosabath <dig> proteins matched, respectively,  <dig> and  <dig> sequences in jako and co-workers library  <cit>  .

gene expression of selected carotenoid and bixin pathway key genes
we selected key cdnas of the carotenoid and bixin biosynthesis pathways for qrt-pcr quantification of their transcript levels in new rna samples from leaves, immature seeds and mature seeds . in the mep pathway, we found that bodxs2a was overexpressed in immature seed in comparison to mature seed and leaf . in the carotenoid pathway, we select bopsy <dig>  bopsy <dig>  bopds <dig>  bozds boβ-lyc <dig>  boβ-lyc <dig> and boε-lyc for qrt-pcr quantification. bopds <dig> and bozds were up-regulated in immature seed whereas bopsy <dig>  bopsy <dig>  boβ-lyc <dig>  boβ-lyc <dig> and boε-lyc were expressed preferentially in leaf . in the bixin pathway, we selected  <dig> cdnas, four boccd <dig> , four boccd <dig> , three boaldh <dig>  and three bosabath . boccd1- <dig>  boccd4- <dig> and boaldh3f <dig> displayed no changes in transcript levels between leaf and immature seed, whereas the remaining genes showed differential expression levels. amongst these differential expressed genes, ten were up-regulated in immature seeds and one was up-regulated in leaves  . in all cases the lowest expression levels were displayed in mature seed . the oligonucleotides sequences used as primers are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr quantification. quantitative analysis by qrt-pcr of selected genes encoding enzymes involved in mep, carotenoid and bixin biosynthesis in leaves , immature seeds , and mature seeds  of bixa orellana. the relative mrna levels were normalized according to a control gene  and expressed relative to the corresponding values of leaf . reported values represent means ± sd  of three independent biological replicates



discussion
achiote plants are the source of bixin apocarotenoid. therefore, identification in this species of the genes encoding the putative enzymes of the pathways contributing to bixin synthesis, such as mep, carotenoid and bixin pathways, is of basic and applied importance. description of these genes before this study was limited and incomplete , probably due to coverage limitation of the available est libraries from immature seeds  <cit> . a complicating factor is that b. orellana is recalcitrant to molecular biology studies, probably because its tissues contain high amounts of secondary metabolites that hinder purification of nucleic acids  <cit> . with development of high throughput sequencing technology, which are effective with lesser amounts and shorter fragments of rna, whole transcriptome sequencing became feasible in b. orellana. this technology has successfully been applied to identify the mep and carotenoid pathways genes in momordica cochinchinensis  <cit> , citrus sinensis  <cit>  and citrullus lanatus  <cit> . application of this technology to sequencing the first b. orellana transcriptome allowed us to elucidate the complete bixin biosynthesis pathway including mep and carotenoid pathways.

transcriptome assembling of bixa orellana
a total of  <dig>  contigs were obtained from the transcriptome assembly, which was carried out with the combined use of three assembly programs, velvet, clc and cap <dig>  each providing complementary strengths  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  proteins larger than  <dig> aa were predicted in the achiote transcriptome, a number similar to that of other sequenced species such as t. cacao, c. papaya, c. sinensis, c. clementina and v. vinifera . blast comparison of this transcriptome with the existing b. orellana library database  <cit>  and  <dig> homologous proteins previously isolated , confirmed that our b. orellana assembly is reliable because of high coverage and identity . moreover, the cdna sequence covering predicted full length orfs of carotenoid  and bixin  pathways genes obtained through the in silico assembly were confirmed by independent cdna sequencing.

evolutionary relationship of bixa orellana
according to the angiosperm phylogeny group  system, b. orellana belongs to the malvales order, malvidae clade. malvales include several commercial crops such as kenaf , roselle , cacao , cotton  and cola nut   <cit> . phylogenetic reconstructions based on two sets of b. orellana proteins  is in agreement with apg classification. as shown in fig.  <dig>  b. orellana is grouped with two members of malvales available in sequence databases . interestingly, this small group is more closely related to members of the order malpighiales  than to other orders of malvidae such as brassicales or huertelaes. this discrepancy has been documented, suggesting that the order malpighiales belongs to the malvidae rather than fabidae  <cit> . the evolutionary relationship of b. orellana with malvales and malpighiales is also reflected in the comparison of the whole achiote transcriptome against plant protein databases . as shown in fig.  <dig> cacao is most represented among the matches in the phytozome and plaza  <dig>  comparisons, followed by cotton , cassava , citrus , poplar , papaya  and castor bean . comparison to refseq was biased because most proteins of g. raimondii, m.esculenta and c. papaya were not available there through may,  <dig> 

methylerythritol phosphate  pathway genes
the mep pathway is the predominant supplier of carotenoid biosynthesis precursors isopentenyl and dimethylallyl diphosphate   <cit> . in this pathway, pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate are condensed and converted to ipp and dmapp by seven enzymes . in this work, we identified the genes encoding these enzymes . similar to species with multi-copies of dxs gene  <cit> , achiote also has a small family of four bodxs genes. phylogenetic analysis of dxs proteins grouped one protein in the dxs type i clade , two proteins in the dxs type ii clade  and the last  in the dxs type iii clade . enzymes from the dxs <dig> clade, but not dxs <dig> or dxs <dig>  are involved in carotenoid and apocarotenoid accumulation in non-photosynthetic tissues like seeds  <cit> . in this work, we found that the bodxs2a gene was overexpressed in immature seeds , which suggests that bodxs2a could be involved in the synthesis of seed carotenoids and apocarotenoids. overexpression in immature seed of bodxs2a , and bodxr, bohds and bohdr   <cit> , might lead to high concentration of carotenoids and apocarotenoids in immature seed.fig.  <dig> model of gene regulation in bixin biosynthesis. genes with qrt-quantification are represented with filled rectangles. filled red rectangles indicate genes displaying increased expression in immature seed. filled green rectangles indicate downregulated genes. red unfilled rectangles indicate genes represented in the jako’s immature seed library. asterisks denote partial sequences. the green line indicates blocked downstream process. the green square represents the plastid. the yellow square represents the cytosol. bright yellow marks the mep pathway genes. the orange square contains the carotenoid pathway genes and the blue square the bixin pathway. the dashed arrow indicates lycopene feedback regulation. the figure was generated with pathvision  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> 



carotenoid pathway genes of bixa orellana
the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway includes  <dig> enzymes that convert two ggdp molecules into a variety of carotenoids. here, we infer from cdna characterization the existence of  <dig> genes encoding these enzymes . with the exception of bopsy, the qrt-pcr quantification profiles suggest enhanced lycopene production in immature seeds, analogous to what was observed during red ripening in tomato fruits. the accumulation of lycopene in tomato is apparently due to downregulation of β-lyc and ε-lyc, and upregulation of psy, pds and zds . positive feedback regulation may occur during tomato ripening: expression of pds and zds increases in response to low quantities of end-products of the carotenoid pathway, such as β-carotene, xanthophylls or aba  <cit> . a similar scenario could take place in immature seed of b. orellana: genes that encode cyclase enzymes were down-regulated in immature seed , potentially blocking the carotenoid pathway below lycopene and leading to a decrease in cyclic carotenoids concentration. bozds and bopds <dig> overexpression in immature seed  could thus be a response to low concentrations of end-products in the carotenoid pathway . consistent with such a block at the immature seed stage, low β-carotene and aba levels  <cit>  correlated with the presence of pds and absence of lycopene cyclase transcripts  in this tissue  <cit> . if this block is occurring, the lycopene could accumulate in immature seeds increasing the availability of this compound for the bixin pathway. in conclusion, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that lycopene is the main precursor of bixin .

identification of new candidates bixin biosynthesis pathway genes
bixin is an orange-red apocarotenoid that accumulates in high quantities in seeds, accounting for 80 % of the total carotenoids. concentrations of bixin increase continuously during development of immature seeds until they reach maximum size  <cit> . how is lycopene converted into bixin? the literature indicates the action of three types of enzymes:  <dig>  carotene cleavage deoxygenase;  <dig>  aldehyde dehydrogenase; and  <dig>  methyltransferase. putative b. orellana sequences encoding these enzymes have been described  <cit> . surprisingly, we were unable to find transcripts corresponding to the sequences proposed for the above enzymes. instead, we identified mrnas encoding different boccds, boaldh and bomts enzymes and believe that these are involved in bixin synthesis. the discrepancy between these and previous findings is explained by the phylogenetic placements of these proteins. the enzymes proposed by bouvier and co-workers  <cit>  are placed in clades corresponding to monocotyledonous species such as crocus sativus. furthermore, bolcd and bonbmt placement in these clades is well supported with bootstrap values of  <dig> and 96 %, respectively . it is therefore likely that these cdnas are not from bixa orellana, but may have been misplaced in the original study. the sequences proposed here for these enzymes, on the other hand, are in the same phylogenetic branch as cotton, cacao and other dicotyledonous plants and were confirmed as bixa sequences by pcr amplification using independent bixa orellana rna samples.

the initial step of bixin synthesis is the 5-6/5′-6′ oxidative cleavage of lycopene catalyzed by carotenoid cleavage oxygenase to produce bixin aldehyde  <cit> . in plants, nine types of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase have been identified, but only the ccd type  <dig> and type  <dig> have been associated with pigment pathways . we identified nine putative ccd proteins, four of them ccd type  <dig> and five type  <dig> . as can be seen in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  boccd1- <dig> and boccd1- <dig> were closely related to previously isolated ccd <dig>  <cit>  and they are grouped with monocotyledonous boccd <dig> proteins; this cluster, which was also present in other phylogenetic analysis of ccd family  <cit> , is not well supported with a bootstrap values of  <dig> in this study and  <dig>  <cit> , and could be spurious. the gene expression level of previously isolated boccd <dig>  correlated with bixin accumulation in b. orellana  <cit> . this suggests that boccd1- <dig> and boccd1- <dig> could be involved in the cleavage of carotenes to produce seed apocarotenoids, such as aba and bixin. however, our qrt-pcr analysis indicated that boccd1- <dig> is equally expressed in leaf and immature seed. boccd1- <dig> was preferentially expressed in leaf. unlike these genes, boccd1- <dig> and boccd1- <dig>  were overexpressed ~ <dig>  times and ~ <dig> times in immature seed compared to leaf, respectively . this suggests that boccd1- <dig> and boccd1- <dig> are involved in the cleavage of carotenes in immature seed. ccd <dig> enzymes have the ability, in vitro, to cleave the 5-6/5′-6′ bond in acyclic carotenoids like lycopene . however, experimental subcellular localizations of ccd <dig> proteins indicated that they are localized in the cytosol without direct access to lycopene  <cit> . in silico prediction of protein properties suggests that boccd1- <dig> is not localized in the chloroplast and presumably does not have direct access to lycopene , therefore it could not be involved in the bixin pathway unless it cleaves lycopene in the cytosol.

ccd <dig> has the ability to cleave lycopene at the  <dig>  6/5′,6′ double bond position and the enzymatic activity is specifically associated with plastoglobules within plastids where it has access to its carotenoid substrates . we assembled four cdnas that were each predicted to encode a complete boccd <dig> orf . the small family formed by these four proteins  probably originated by duplication, as it appears to be present in other woody plants like t. cacao and p. trichocarpa. qrt-pcr quantification indicated that boccd4- <dig>  boccd4- <dig> and boccd4- <dig> were upregulated in immature seed, suggesting their involvement in the first step of the bixin pathway . the cdnas encoding the boccd4- <dig> and boccd4- <dig> proteins were also represented in the previous immature seed library   <cit> . according to subcellular localization prediction, boccd4- <dig> and boccd4- <dig> are localized in chloroplasts, whereas boccd4- <dig> is localized in the cytosol . taken together, this evidence suggests that boccd4- <dig> and boccd4- <dig> cleave lycopene in plastids, where bixin is synthesized. we cannot dismiss the possibility that boccd1- <dig> and boccd4- <dig> could participate in the first step of bixin synthesis. alternatively, the bixin pathway could be localized both in plastids and in the cytosol. in this case, boccd4- <dig> and boccd4- <dig> could cleave one 5– <dig> lycopene double bound in plastids followed by export of the resulting c <dig> intermediate to the cytosol. next, boccd1- <dig> and boccd4- <dig> would cleave the other 5′-6′ double bond to produce bixin aldehyde, and cytosolic boaldhs and bosabath would complete the bixin pathway . the sequential cleavage, first in plastid and then in cytosol, has been demonstrated in the mycorradicin pathway  <cit> .

aldehyde dehydrogenase candidate proteins in bixin synthesis
the second step in the bixin pathway is the oxidation of aldehyde groups in bixin aldehyde, into carboxylic acids by aldehyde dehydrogenase  <cit> . thirteen distinct families of plant aldehyde dehydrogenases enzymes have been identified, although only ten families  are present in most plant species  <cit> . previously identified b. orellana aldhs that could be involved in the bixin pathway include five clusters of ests differentially expressed in immature seed  <cit> , and one bobadh   <cit> , which appears to be a member of the aldh <dig> family, specifically type 2c <dig>  bobadh is related to aldh2c <dig> of monocotyledonous plants, especially that of c. sativus . here, we identified  <dig> boaldhs cdnas from the ten families constituting the common core group . a partial boaldh2c <dig> sequence was also identified in the transcriptome. the fact that aldh2c <dig> isolated by bouvier and co-workers  <cit>  is capable of converting aldehyde groups from bixin aldehyde into carboxylic acids and that it is predicted to localize in the chloroplast , suggests that boaldh2c <dig> could catalyze the second step of the bixin pathway in plastids. alternatively, boaldh2c <dig> could be acting in the cytosol because in silico prediction and experimental data indicate that orthologous a. thaliana, g. max, z. mays, e. parvula and e. salsugineum aldh2c <dig> proteins have cytosolic localization .

based on subcellular localization prediction, qrt-pcr quantification and presence in the jako’s library  <cit> , the other three boaldh  could also be involved in the bixin pathway. the subcellular localization predicted by plant-mploc and plpred for boaldh3h1- <dig>  boaldh3i <dig> and boaldh7b <dig> indicate that they are localized in chloroplast, where they could have access to bixin aldehyde . additionally, orthologous proteins predicted to be localized in the chloroplast are found in a. thaliana, , zea mays , e. parvula and e. salsugineum , and g. max   <cit> . boaldh3h1- <dig>  boaldh3i <dig> and boaldh7b <dig> are found in the immature seed jako’s library  <cit> . moreover, our qrt-pcr analyses indicate that boaldh3i <dig> and boaldh3h1- <dig> are also upregulated in immature seed . the subcellular localization of these three proteins in immature seed and the broad range of substrates catalyzed, suggest that these proteins could catalyze the second step in bixin pathway to produce norbixin in plastid or cytosol. the best candidates for this role, however, are boaldh3i <dig> and boadlh3h <dig> because these enzymes can act on various substrates in plastids  or cytosol    <cit> . moreover, orthologous aldh3h <dig> and aldh3i <dig> proteins from synechocystis sp. , neurospora crassa  and fusarium fujikuroi  have the ability to oxidize aldehyde groups from apocarotenoides into carboxylic acids .

methyltransferases candidate proteins in bixin synthesis
the last step of bixin biosynthesis involves a methyltransferase that methylates a norbixin carboxyl group; members of the sabath methyltransferase family methylate carboxyl groups  <cit> . this family also includes enzymes that methylate nitrogen atoms. previous sabath methyltransferases identified in b. orellana include two clusters of ests from the jako’s library  <cit> , and bonbmt, which methylates the carboxyl groups of norbixin   <cit> . here, we identified  <dig> sabath methyltransferases. none of them is closely related to bonbmt , which is grouped with the c. sativus methyltransferase. bosamth <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are placed in the same clade, raising the possibility that these proteins share the function of methylating norbixin. in this group of proteins, bosabath <dig> could be involved in bixin synthesis because qrt-pcr indicated that it is overexpressed in immature seed . probably, bosabath <dig> methylates norbixin in the cytosol because it is not predicted to have a plastidial localization . qrt-pcr analysis of bosabath <dig> and bosabath <dig> transcripts shows that they are upregulated in immature seed , thus suggesting that these proteins could be involved in bixin biosynthesis; furthermore, these proteins are represented in the jako’s immature seed library  <cit> . subcellular localization prediction indicates that bosabath <dig> and bosabath <dig> are plastidial proteins with direct access to norbixin in chloroplast or chromoplast. additionally, we identified  <dig> methyltransferases involved in secondary metabolism , but these were not taken into consideration as candidates for norbixin methylation because most methylate oxygen atoms in benzenic rings.

bixin biosynthesis model
bixin production involves the coordinate expression of the mep, carotenoid and bixin pathways genes in immature seed. figure  <dig> illustrates three molecular steps necessary to synthetized bixin:  <dig>  bodxs2a and others mep genes involved in generation of carotenoids precursor such as bodxr and bohdr are induced to produce carotenoids in non photosynthetic tissue.  <dig>  lycopene cyclase genes  are turned off, thus blocking metabolic flow toward cyclic carotenoids downstream of lycopene. the low concentrations of β-carotene and xanthophyll, induce the expression of bopds <dig> and bozds and promote lycopene production in plastoglobules of immature seed cells. in this scenario, also psy should be upregulated, as suggested by its representation in the jako’s library  <cit> . surprisingly, the two genes found in this transcriptome were downregulated in our dataset.  <dig>  the boccds , boaldh <dig>  and bosabath  genes are then turned on leading to lycopene conversion to bixin in plastoglobules or cytosol .

CONCLUSIONS
deep sequencing of the bixa orellana transcriptome enabled the the isolation and characterization of the complete mep and carotenoid pathway genes. our inability to find in this transcriptome cdnas previously identified by bouvier and co-workers  <cit> , lead us to propose new and alternative enzymes, whose identification was based on the upregulation of the corresponding genes. these findings will help elucidate the regulatory mechanisms controlling the production and accumulation of carotenoid and bixin in b. orellana. for this, characterization of the enzymatic activities proposed here will be necessary. finally, this information will help identify the candidate genes and mechanisms for variation of apocarotenoids accumulation in achiote varieties, thus facilitating the genetic improvement of achiote for high bixin content.
