BACKGROUND
segment polarity genes induce signaling pathways that direct morphogenesis by giving cells positional information that in turn is translated into appropriate differentiation programs. the sonic hedgehog  signaling pathway is required in many tissues for embryonic patterning, cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . inappropriate activation of the pathway drives tumorigenesis in the skin  <cit>  and other tissues  <cit> .

the cubitus interruptus protein  in drosophila and gli proteins in mammals are the transcriptional effectors of the shh signaling pathway. like in fruit fly, multiple gli transcription factors in vertebrates participate in the transduction of shh signal and may repress transcription of shh target genes  <cit> . similarly to ci, gli <dig> and gli <dig> can be proteolytically processed forming an n-terminal repressor that is concentrated in the nucleus  <cit> . interestingly, deletion of n-terminal fragment of mouse gli <dig> containing putative repressor domain altered skin tumor phenotype  <cit> . hedgehog  signaling controls ci protein activity at the post-translational level. in the absence of the hh signaling ci is processed into a truncated repressor form which can inhibit hh target genes  <cit> . loss of hh function results in all ci being converted into the repressor form  <cit> . different in vitro functions of gli proteins suggest that gli <dig> and gli <dig> respond to and are activated by shh signaling, whereas gli <dig> is a transcriptional target of activated gli <dig> and gli <dig>  <cit> .

several studies reveal how gli proteins are regulated in the cytoplasm through vertebrate protein supressor of fused , previously identified in flies as having antagonistic role in hh signaling  <cit> . sufu can sequester gli proteins in the cytoplasm, but can also interact with gli bound to dna. thus, sufu is considered to be a key negative regulator of the hh signaling pathway in vertebrates  <cit> . targeted disruption of the murine suppressor of fused gene  led to a phenotype that included neural tube defects and lethality at mid-gestation  <cit> .

it has been proposed that hh signaling leads to the inhibition of sufu, deposphorylation of glis and the production of transcriptionally active forms with enhanced nuclear import  <cit> . a short motif of four amino acids , sygh, is required for the interaction of sufu with gli. the activity of gli transcription factors with mutations in this motif is no longer suppressed by co-expression with sufu  <cit> .

each gli has distinct activities that are analogous to the regulatory properties of ci  <cit> . the first studies on mammalian gli genes in vivo revealed the combinatorial action of genes. in fact, gli <dig> and gli <dig>  but not gli <dig> and gli <dig> have extensive overlapping functions  <cit> . gli <dig>  but not gli <dig>  is required for initial shh signaling and ectopic activation of shh pathway  <cit> . gli2-/- mice die at birth exhibiting defects in floor plate and adjacent interneuron development, as well as in vertebrae, bones and lungs  <cit> . interestingly, gli2;gli <dig> double mutant mice develop more severe defects in skeleton and foregut derivatives than either single mutant, indicating that gli <dig> and gli <dig> possess both unique and overlapping functions  <cit> . in addition, loss-of-function mutations in the human gli <dig> gene are associated with a distinctive phenotype whose primary features include defective anterior pituitary formation and pan-hypopituitarism, with or without overt forebrain cleavage abnormalities  <cit> . similarly, several disorders of mouse and human development, are caused by gli <dig> mutations  <cit>  and references therein.

despite of extensive gene targeting studies, there have been no comprehensive studies on the structure of the gli <dig> gene. human gli <dig> was originally identified as a tax-helper protein  that binds to tax-responsive element in the long terminal repeat of the human t-cell leukemia virus  <cit> . however, when compared to orthologous gli <dig> genes from different species, the human mrnas lacked a part of the 5' region encoding the evolutionarily conserved n-terminus of gli <dig>  recently, roessler et al.  <cit>  have discovered a 5' sequence encoding  <dig> aa and showed that this so far undescribed amino-terminal repressor domain was essential for the dominant negative activity of the human gli <dig>  the transcription repression activity of c-terminally truncated gli variants has been demonstrated by two independent studies showing that gli <dig> and gli <dig> proteins contained separate transcription repressor and activator domains  <cit>  which in case of gli <dig> were regulated by proteolytic processing  <cit> . however, in contrast to gli <dig>  overexpressed gli <dig> was not processed efficiently  <cit> . thus, the exact mechanism of repressor generation remains unclear, leaving us with a question whether mechanisms other than proteolytic processing may influence the functional activity of gli <dig> 

to study the potential role of mrna splicing in generation of different gli <dig> protein variants, we determined the exon-intron organization of human gli <dig> and analyzed tissue-specific distribution of gli <dig> mrna and its alternatively spliced forms. here we show that the revised human gli <dig> contains an alternative 5' noncoding exon and its last coding exon encompasses a  <dig> bp-long 3' utr. comparison with the mouse gli <dig> gene/mrna confirmed the presence of exons 3– <dig> in the human gli <dig>  <cit> . two novel alternatively spliced forms of gli <dig> generated by skipping exon  <dig>  or exons  <dig> and  <dig> were detected in ovary and testis. these forms showed different activator properties in the gli-dependent transactivation assay. our results suggest that alternative splicing in the 5' terminal region of human gli <dig> mrna plays an important role in regulation of gli <dig> expression and generation of protein isoforms with different activities.

RESULTS
human gli <dig> contains four exons encoding amino-terminal repressor domain
to identify common structural elements of the human and mouse gli <dig> genes, we compared their genomic structures and mrnas. mouse gli <dig> gene contains  <dig> exons located in about  <dig> kb region on the chromosome 1e2+ <dig>  as revealed by alignment of the mouse gli <dig> mrna  <cit>  to the corresponding genomic contig . extension of the published mrna sequence  <cit>  by  <dig> nucleotides  in the 5' untranslated region  and  <dig> nt in the 3' utr using overlapping est sequences  generated mrna of  <dig> nt. the last exon has  <dig> nt of 3' utr and contains a polyadenylation signal attaaa, located  <dig> nt upstream of the polya addition site. the location of the cap site of the mrna is not known. mouse gli <dig> mrna has a coding region of  <dig> aa predicting a protein of  <dig> kd  <cit> .

to characterize the exon-intron organization of human gli <dig>  we aligned human ests  and human and mouse gli <dig> mrnas  to the human genomic contig . these alignments revealed that, similarly to the mouse counterpart, human gli <dig> consists of  <dig> exons spanning  <dig> kb on the chromosome 2q <dig> . comparison between mouse and human gli <dig> structures predicted the presence of exons 3– <dig> of human gli <dig> similar to those of the mouse gli <dig>  this conclusion confirms earlier finding of roessler et al.  <cit> , who demonstrated the presence of exons 3– <dig> in the human gli <dig> mrna, although details of their prediction have not been described. the complete orf of human gli <dig> starts from exon  <dig> and terminates in exon  <dig> predicting a protein of  <dig> aa with molecular weight of  <dig> kd . the predicted protein structure differs from that described by roessler et al.  <cit>  by a <dig> aa sequence . this extra sequence is present in the published protein sequence  that is derived from alternatively spliced gli <dig> mrna   <cit> . the respective mrna is spliced using alternative acceptor splice site located  <dig> nt upstream from the boundary of intron  <dig> and exon  <dig>  it should be noted that alternative splicing involving  <dig> nt deletion/insertion in the coding region of gli <dig> mrna has been described previously  <cit> . since our rt-pcr reaction using primers derived from exons  <dig> and  <dig>  yielded the major product of  <dig> bp lacking the  <dig> nt in exon  <dig>  we believe that the gli <dig> protein used in our studies represents the predominant form  of the human gli <dig> protein. in addition, mouse gli <dig> mrna coding region  <cit>  lacks the respective  <dig> nt sequence.

gli <dig> protein is conserved throughout vertebrate evolution, showing high degree of sequence identity to its orthologs from mouse  <cit> , chicken  <cit>  and zebrafish  <cit>  . conservation of the n-terminus , containing putative repressor domain  <cit> , is even more striking – 94% identity with mouse, 87% identity with chicken, and 78% identity with zebrafish .

gli <dig> has two alternative 5' noncoding exons and extension in the 3' utr
comparison of human and mouse gli <dig> transcripts . exon 1a is highly conserved between human, mouse , rat and dog, showing 75–83% identity at the nucleotide level . it is about  <dig> kb upstream of the exon  <dig> . exon 1b is located about  <dig> kb upstream of exon  <dig> and corresponds to the 5' sequence of the original gli <dig> mrna, cloned from htlv-1-infected hut <dig> cells  <cit> . to determine whether exons 1a and 1b are transcribed in vivo, we amplified the gli <dig> 5' region from human cell line and tissue cdnas using forward and reverse primers annealing to exons 1a or 1b and  <dig>  respectively. amplification products of predicted size and sequence were obtained for exon 1a  as well as exon 1b  using cdnas derived from ovary, testis, teratocarcinoma cell line ntera2d <dig> and human embryonic kidney cell line hek <dig> . this result shows that both alternative first exons are used in vivo. although we did not quantify the level of gli <dig> mrna in different human tissues, gli <dig> transcripts containing exon 1a seemed to be more abundant than those containing exon 1b. in summary, these results show that human gli <dig> locus harbors two alternative 5' noncoding exons, one of which is highly conserved and has not been described before. the gli <dig> cdna sequences encompassing exons 1a and 1b have been deposited in genbank under accession numbers dq <dig> and dq <dig>  respectively.

the published human gli <dig> mrnas  <cit>  lack about two thirds of the 3' utr  when compared to the mouse gli <dig> 3' utr. comparison with human ests  and genomic sequence  predicts that the human gli <dig> mrna has a  <dig> nt-long 3' utr containing polyadenylation signal attaaa. this signal and its surrounding region are well conserved between human and mouse gli <dig> suggesting their requirement for polyadenylation. this fact is also supported by two gli <dig> ests that terminate with poly sequences  <dig> nt downstream of the signal .

to confirm the presence of the predicted 3' utr in the gli <dig> transcripts, rt-pcr with 3' utr-specific primers was carried out. amplification products of the predicted size  and sequence were obtained for cdnas derived from gonadal tissues and two human cell lines . this result shows that human gli <dig> mrna has an extended 3' utr as predicted from the bioinformatic analysis. another potential polyadenylation signal aataaa, located  <dig> nt upstream, has been described earlier  <cit> . however, this may rather represent a cloning arfefact, since this motif is followed by an a-rich region  known to cause oligo-dt mispriming during cdna synthesis  <cit>  . futhermore, this a-rich sequence is not conserved in mouse gli <dig> gene. the revised structure of the human gli <dig> mrna containing complete orf and its translation is shown in fig.  <dig> 

identification of novel alternatively spliced forms of gli <dig> mrna
we decided to study gli <dig> expression in different human tissues because our gene/mrna structure analysis predicted the existence of mrna alternatively spliced forms. to determine the expression profile of human gli <dig> mrna, we carried out pcr with primers derived from exons  <dig> and  <dig>  pcr products of the expected size  were observed for a number of commercial cdnas and different human cell lines. figure 5a shows that gli <dig> mrna is strongly expressed in the ovary, testis, pancreas, liver, small intestine and thymus. while low level of expression was observed for a number of tissues , almost no expression was detected in heart, brain and peripheral blood leukocytes. three  <dig>  kb products of identical size obtained from prostate, ovary and spleen cdnas were selected for cloning and sequencing. sequencing of two randomly selected clones from each cloning confirmed that human gli <dig> mrna contained exons 3– <dig>  as predicted from the gene structure . the cloned sequence encompassing exons 2– <dig> is available in genbank under accession number ay <dig> 

we also detected three minor rt-pcr products corresponding to gli <dig> transcript variants approximately  <dig> and  <dig> bp shorter than gli <dig> mrna described above. these transcripts were present exclusively in ovary, testis and different cell lines . sequencing of 2– <dig> individual cdna clones  corresponding to these variants showed that they represented three different types of alternative splicing . type i clones had exon  <dig> spliced to exon  <dig>  type ii clones showed similar skipping of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  but had a different splice acceptor site between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  type iii clones had exon  <dig> spliced to exon  <dig>  representative sequences of each type of splicing are available in genbank under accession numbers ay <dig>  ay <dig> and dq <dig>  these results show that in the human tissues, gli <dig> mrna may be represented by three different alternatively spliced forms. for all gli <dig> mrna alternatively spliced forms described, the major orf starting from the exon  <dig> with the sequence metsa  was followed by premature termination codon. thus, translation from the alternatively spliced forms is possible only from downstream initiator codons in frame with the main orf.

alternative splicing of gli <dig> mrna is responsible for the synthesis of gli <dig> protein isoforms with different activities
we hypothesized that splicing within the first seven exons may be involved in the exclusion or inclusion of the repressor domain of gli <dig> protein. to test if alternatively spliced isoforms gli2Δ <dig> and gli2Δ4– <dig> can produce functional proteins, the corresponding cdnas were subcloned into pcdna <dig> expression vector and tested for the production of proteins using translation in vitro. fig. 7a shows that gli2Δ4– <dig> and gli2Δ <dig> generate n-terminally truncated proteins with approximate sizes  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda, respectively. because gli <dig> orf starting from the aug located in exon  <dig> ended with premature termination codon, translation of the alternatively spliced forms of gli <dig> was possible only from downstream aug codons . the low protein yield obtained in the case of gli2Δ4– <dig> was apparently due to inefficient translation initiation.

to determine the activation or repression effect of proteins produced from gli <dig> mrna and its alternatively spliced forms, each construct  was co-transfected with 12xgliluc reporter plasmid into cos- <dig> cells. in this transactivation assay, gli2Δ <dig> activator effect was comparable to that of the gli2fl . however, gli2Δ4– <dig> showed about 10-fold increase in the reporter activity, suggesting that the enhanced activation was due to the loss of repressor activity, i.e. excision of repressor domain  by alternative splicing.

transactivation experiments repeated with ptch promoter, containing two gli <dig> binding sites  <cit> , yielded similar results, although in this case about 3-fold enhancement was detected . transcriptional activity of all constructs was significantly suppressed by co-transfection with sufu construct indicating that sufu-binding domain, sygh, encoded by exon  <dig> was intact in all constructs used. these data show that both gli2Δ4– <dig> and gli2Δ <dig> generate alternatively spliced forms that can be translated into active proteins. difference in their activities is most likely caused by the n-terminal sequence mehylrsvhssptlsmisaarglspadvaqehlkerglfglpapgttpsdyyhqmtlvaghpapygdllmqsggaasaphlhdylnpvd, encoded by gli2Δ <dig> and missing in gli2Δ4– <dig>  we suspected that this  <dig> aa region  might contain critical sequences required for gli <dig> repressor activity. to map these sequences more precisely, we deleted the first  <dig> aa of the n-terminal sequence encoded of gli2Δ <dig> by generating gli2Δ3bb. expression of this construct most likely produces an n-terminally truncated protein with translation initiation from the sequence mtlvag located  <dig> aa downstream with respect to the gli2Δ <dig> translation initiation. this prediction was also supported by gli2Δ3bb translation in vitro . in the transactivation assay, gli2Δ3bb showed enhanced activation reaching about 70% level of that of gli2Δ4– <dig> , suggesting that  <dig> aa encoded by exons  <dig> and  <dig> were critical for the repressor activity. in summary, our results show that alternative splicing involved in the deletion of the repressor domain encoded by exons  <dig> and  <dig> is responsible for the enhanced activation of gli <dig> protein.

discussion
in this study we describe the structure of the human gli <dig> gene and its expression in different human tissues. a detailed comparison between human and mouse gli <dig> structures allowed us to revise the structure of human gli <dig>  <cit>  by introducing a novel noncoding exon  and extending the 3' utr. our data support the earlier finding of roessler et al.  <cit>  that human gli <dig> contains exons 3– <dig> encoding repressor domain. this domain is highly conserved in evolution and has a major impact on the modulation of gli <dig> transcriptional activity. as inferred from the studies on ci and gli <dig>  the most likely mechanism that separates repressor and activator domains is proteolytic processing  <cit> . here we show for the first time that in addition to proteolytic processing, alternative splicing may be another important regulatory mechanism which causes deletion of the major part of repressor domain and thus is responsible for the enhanced activation of human gli <dig>  in theory, translation from the downstream initiator codon observed in the alternatively spliced form gli2Δ4– <dig> is rather inefficient. nevertheless, the activation effect observed  is significant, although less protein is produced from gli2Δ4– <dig> compared to gli2fl.

previous studies of others  <cit>  showed that the removal of the n-terminal region  resulted about 10-fold enhancement of the transcriptional activity of mouse gli <dig>  similarly, expression of truncated human gli <dig> lacking n-terminal  <dig> aa, encoded by exons 2– <dig>  demonstrated substantial increase  in transcriptional activity of gli <dig>  <cit> . also, cotransfection experiments showed that the repressor domain encoded by exons 2– <dig> is involved in the dominant-negative activity of disease-associated gli <dig> mutants  <cit> .

taken together, all these results show that the n-terminal region of either mouse or human gli <dig> contains a domain with transcriptional repressor activity. while all these results suggest that repressor domain of mouse and human gli <dig> is encoded by exons 2– <dig>  our results show the the removal of exons 4– <dig> alone can affect transcriptional activity of gli <dig>  additional mapping of the repressor activity showed that a critical  <dig> aa-long sequence is encoded by exons  <dig> and  <dig>  therefore, our results strongly suggest that alternative splicing may be involved in the regulation of the synthesis of gli <dig> proteins with or without repressor activities. interestingly, we have detected several gli <dig> mrna splice forms, including gli2Δ4– <dig> and gli2Δ <dig> in mouse embryos, indicating that alternative splicing of gli <dig> pre-mrna may be evolutionarily conserved .

previous studies  <cit>  have suggested that human gli <dig> mrna may exist in at least four different isoforms, which can be detected in tumor cell lines or tissues. here we have analyzed alternative splicing in the 5' region of gli <dig>  encompassing exons 1– <dig>  in normal human tissues. we found that exons 3– <dig> are involved in the alternative splicing and corresponding alternatively spliced forms  were exclusively found in adult ovarian and testicular tissues, raising a question about potential role of gli <dig> acting solely as an activator of germ cell development. it should be noted, that knock-in mice expressing full-length gli <dig> cdna from the endogenous gli <dig> locus are normal and viable, arguing against the role of alternative transcripts in normal mouse development  <cit> . our attempts to detect alternatively spliced forms of gli <dig> mrna, in which exons  <dig> and  <dig> were spliced together , as described earlier  <cit> , have not been successful. it is likely that different alternatively spliced forms are expressed in tumor cell lines or tissues. however their origin remains unclear. it is also important to note that a highly conserved motif sygh involved in the interaction of gli <dig> with sufu  <cit>  is encoded by exon  <dig>  because this exon is lost in the spliced form gli2Δ3– <dig>  it is possible that its expression gives rise to a gli <dig> protein escaping repression and/or sequestration effects of sufu. we believe that the loss of sufu binding site of gli <dig> protein may have important implications in the regulation of shh signaling pathway. however, to prove this possibility, additional experiments are required.

we have shown that human gli <dig> contains two alternative noncoding 5' exons 1a and 1b. this feature typically suggests the usage of alternative promoters and thus adds another layer of complexity to the regulation of human gli <dig>  it remains to be explored how these promoters can influence the biological function of human gli <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we report here the revised structure of human gli <dig> gene. we present evidence that alternative splicing regulates the transcriptional activity of gli <dig>  our data suggest that in addition to proteolytic processing, alternative splicing may be another important regulatory mechanism for the modulation of repressor and activator properties of gli <dig> protein.
