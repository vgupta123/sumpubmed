BACKGROUND
as an organellar genome, animal mitochondrial dna is typically a circular molecule of 15– <dig> kb, usually encoding  <dig> proteins,  <dig> transfer rnas, and  <dig> ribosomal rnas  <cit> . thanks to its maternal inheritance, rapid evolutionary rate, and lack of recombination, fragments of mitochondrial dna have been extensively used for studies of genetic structure, phylogenetics, and phylogeography at various taxonomic levels. since studying complete mt sequences can uncover more information about gene order, rearrangements, and other variation at the genome level for all phyla, there have been significant increases in the number of complete mitochondrial sequences available in recent years  <cit> . it is known that mitochondrial gene order and its variation can be very useful for inferring evolutionary relationships  <cit> . reportedly, molluscan species show an extraordinary amount of variation in gene arrangement, in contrast to the more limited gene rearrangement in many species of arthropoda  <cit> .

of the  <dig> complete mollusk mt genomes available in genbank,  <dig> of which are from bivalves, including mytilus edulis, mytilus trossulus, mytilus galloprovincialis, venerupis philippinarum, lampsilis ornata etc., as well as two from oyster species. oysters are distributed worldwide and are a species-rich bivalve group. mitochondrial genomes of two oyster species, c. gigas and c. virginica, are available recently  <cit> . in comparing the mt-dna of these two species, there is evidence of extensive genomic rearrangements and several duplications; mitochondrial genome information from additional species, therefore, would shed light on our relatively limited understanding of oyster evolutionary relationships.

c. hongkongensis  is primarily found in waters along the coast of the south china sea  <cit> . with an annual landing of around  <dig>  million metric tons, oyster farming of c. hongkongensis has been supporting one of the largest marine aquaculture industries in this area, marketing its products primarily to hong kong, macau, taiwan, and local markets as well. populations were studied using different genetic markers, however, more polymorphic markers are needed for better and more detailed stock analysis  <cit> . with the process of urbanization and industrialization in some coastal regions, wild populations of this species have experienced some degree of decline. meanwhile, the development of the oyster farming industry is driving resource management concerns and a desire for stock improvement. stock enhancement is desired for stable and sustainable development of this industry. interest in c. hongkongensis mitochondrial dna has been increasing recently, partially due to the potential of mtdna as a genetic marker for population analysis, stock management, and breeding programs. in this study, we determined the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of c. hongkongensis, in the hope of providing mt genome data for exploring possible mechanisms of gene rearrangements, addressing phylogenetic relationships among oysters and other molluscan species, as well as identifying more variable mtdna regions for genetics studies and stock management of this important aquaculture resource.

RESULTS
genomic organization and structure
the mitochondrial genome of c. hongkongensis is  <dig>  bp in length , shorter than that of the other two oysters whose mt-genomes have been sequenced, c. gigas  and c. virginica . however, the size of the c. hongkongesis mt-genome is certainly within the range of size of molluscan mtdna genomes sequenced to date, i.e. from  <dig>  bp in biomphalaria glabrata to  <dig>  bp in placopecten magellanicus. the c. hongkongensis mtdna contains  <dig> protein-coding genes ,  <dig> transfer trna genes  and  <dig> ribosomal rna genes , all apparently transcribed from the same strand, a common feature in marine bivalves.

§ intergenic region refer to noncoding bases between the feature on the same line and the feature on the line underneath, with a negative number indicating an overlap.

the arrangement of protein-coding genes in c. hongkongensis is identical to that of c. gigas and c. virginica, in the order of cox <dig>  cox <dig>  cob, cox <dig>  atp <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig> and nad4l , with trna genes punctuating the order  <cit> . however, the location of some trna genes, ribosomal rna genes and a major noncoding region  differ to a great extent among the three crassostrea genomes . the overall genomic organization of c. hongkongensis is more similar to that of c. gigas than to c. virginica, corresponding evidently to their closer genetic relationship. in contrast, in mytilus congeners m. edulis, m. trossulus and m. galloprovincialis, not only are protein-coding genes arranged in the following identical order: cox <dig>  atp <dig>  nad4l, nad <dig>  nad <dig>  cob, cox <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig>  cox <dig>  nad <dig> and nad3; but also the order of trnas, ribosomal rna, and control region are almost the same. in other words, gene arrangement is highly conserved among mytilus species.

the major mt-genomic region significantly different among the three crassostrea genomes is that between cob and nad <dig> , with other regions being almost identical. in this variable region, c. gigas and c. virginica have a segment  that is completely absent in c. hongkongensis. this is a totally striking finding regarding mt genome structure of crassostrea. the segment contains split rrnl5', duplicated rrns and four trna genes in c. gigas, and split rrnl5' and seven trna genes in c. virginica, respectively. additionally, there is obvious variation of gene order in the c. virginica when compared with the other two species: mnr is translocated between cox <dig> and rrns, and some trna genes are rearranged. therefore, this section seems to be an obvious "hot spot" of rearrangement in crassostrea mt genome.

the relationship of genome length in the  <dig> crassostrea species may be a reflection of the segment's loss: although c. gigas is more closely-related to c. hongkongensis than to c. virginica, the genome length difference between them  is greater than that between c. gigas and c. virginica . similarly, the lack of duplicated rrns in c. virginica in this segment may account for the length difference between c. gigas and the c. virginica. as observed by rawlings et al. in dendropoma, this kind of variation in gene order within a genus is likely to be associated with "hot spots" of rearrangements, and may be explained by an intra-mt recombination model  <cit> .

although gene overlap is common in animal mt genomes, there are only two such genes in c. hongkongensis mt genome, nad <dig> overlaps with trnh by  <dig> nucleotide , while in c. gigas and c. virginica there are no overlapping genes  <cit> . additionally, four protein-coding genes directly abut each other as they do in c. gigas:nad5-nad <dig> and nad1-nad4l. in c. virginica,  <dig> genes abut each other: cob-cox <dig> and atp6-nad <dig>  in addition to the two pairs just mentioned  <cit> . as usual, no introns were found, thus it is likely that all of the genes from the coding strand are expressed as a polycistronic rna that is then processed enzymatically to release the protein-coding genes' mrnas, as reported in a few cases  <cit> . since trna secondary structures play a crucial role in rna maturation from the polycistronic transcripts, it is not clear by what mechanism transcript cleavage would occur at the 3' end of nad <dig>  nad <dig> and cox <dig>  as these are not flanked by trna genes  <cit> .

noncoding regions between genes totaled to  <dig>  bp in length, with  <dig> bp in the mnr and another  <dig> bp dispersed in  <dig> intergenic regions . the a+t composition of c. hongkongensis mt-dna is  <dig> %, lower than that of many other invertebrates, but comparable to the  <dig> % a/t composition of c. gigas mt-dna, as well as that of c. virginica  and m. edulis . this a+t bias pattern holds for all protein-coding, trna, rrna genes while noncoding nucleotides except mnr, display an even higher a+t content of  <dig> %, significantly higher than the  <dig> % seen in c. virginica and  <dig> % seen in the pacific oyster. strand skew measures for the distribution of base pairs show an at skew  value of  <dig>  and gc skew  value of  <dig> , respectively, almost the same as those of c. gigas and very similar to those of c. virginica  <cit> . this indicates that the strand containing genes is quite rich in t and g in contrast to that of other mollusks like graptacme eborea, in which the skew values are extremely close to zero  <cit> . the observed g and t richness of the gene coding strand is evidence of codon usage bias.

transfer rna genes
in total,  <dig> trna genes plus a putative suppressor trna gene were identified based on their respective anticodons. sequences complementary to the coding strand  can form an expected cloverleaf structure, with ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides. as found in the other two crassostrea mt-sequences as well as in mtdna of some other species , two serine and two leucine trna genes are differentiated in c. hongkongensis by their anticodons . similarly, an additional trnm with a cognate anticodon was also detected, as found in c. gigas, c. virginica, v. philippinarum and mytilus.

the new finding in this study is that trnc and trnn genes are absent from the mt genome of c. hongkongensis , a phenomenon not reported before for any other mollusk species with mitochondrial genome data available so far, including mizuhopecten yessoensis, which only has nine identified trna genes, though. to confirm the absence of these genes, the mt genome of one more individual of c. hongkongensis was sequenced. both trna genes  were still found absent in the second individual as well. although trnas play a crucial role in rna maturation from polycistronic transcripts, the number of distinct trna genes present in mt genomes varies greatly across eukaryotes. reportedly, the loss of a trna gene  was detected also in antarctic fish and it co-occurred with the loss of nad <dig> gene  <cit> . it is predominantly thought that the loss of trna genes is ameliorated via import of nuclear trnas  <cit> . comparison of gene order  between c. hongkongensis and c. gigas shows that the two genomes are almost identical, except for the segment between rrns  and the trny gene in c. gigas, which  is absent from c. hongkongensis . this segment of c. gigas contains rrnl' <dig>  duplicated rrns, and trna genes trnk, trnq <dig>  trnc and trnn; all of these loci are absent in c. hongkongensis . the absence of the four trna genes and two duplicated or split rrna genes could be explained reasonably if we suppose that the ancestor of c. hongkongensis had this segment as c. gigas currently does and then it was lost through dna rearrangement. this is very likely an example of "tandem duplication-random loss " mechanism for gene rearrangement. meanwhile, since extra copies of other two trna gene trnk and trnq are found outside this region, their loss does not lead to a complete absence of these two trna genes from the mitochondrial genome.

interestingly, a putative suppressor trna gene was identified. this suppressor trna has an anticodon sequence of 3'auu, corresponding to nucleotides 8462– <dig> of the complete dna sequence. it therefore is a nonsense suppressor, and could recognize the stop codon uaa in the mrna and, instead of terminating, insert an amino acid at that position in the polypeptide chain  <cit> . a blast search failed to identify any homologous sequence of the putative suppressor trna gene, although the trna has a predicted secondary structure similar to that of other trnas. lastly, as seen in c. gigas, c. virginica and many other mollusk species, the leu <dig>  trna gene contains the mitochondrial rrna termination box, a quite conserved heptamer tggcaga, at nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> .

protein-coding genes
among the supposed  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> were identified in c. hongkongensis through open reading frame  searching. no atp <dig> coding sequence was detected in this process. boore  <cit>  mentions that a lack of the atp <dig> gene is one of several unusual features of the mytilus mt sequence. the apt <dig> gene is missing from the mt-dna of almost all bivalve species studied so far, including c. gigas, c. virginica, mytilus, p. magellanicus, a. irradians, m. yessoensis and acanthocardia tuberculata. the one exception found so far is hiatella arctica in which the apt <dig> gene is present. interestingly, v. philippinarum, originally not annotated for gene atp <dig> in its mt-genome, was recently found to contain a putative atp <dig> gene, though it apparently only encodes  <dig> amino acids and therefore has questionable gene function  <cit> . in contrast, all gastropoda species  studied to date possess an atp <dig> gene, and as do all cephalopoda species  examined up to now. other mollusk species, from polyplacophora k. tunicata to scaphopoda g. eborea and siphonodentalium lobatum, have an atp <dig> gene as well.

the  <dig> genes in c. hongkongensis are similar in length to their counterparts in crassostrea. however, c. hongkongensis and c. gigas share a higher degree of amino acid similarity in  <dig> genes than do c. hongkongensis or c. gigas and c. virginica. also, a higher level of amino acid identity is shared between c. hongkongensis and c. gigas than that is seen between other pairs . all protein-coding genes start with typical invertebrate initiation codons, with  <dig> employing atg and the other  <dig> using ata. six protein-coding genes were terminated by a taa and five by a tag codon, and one by an incomplete termination codon t--, with its likely completion occurring by polyadenylation after transcript processing  <cit> .

*ch: crassostrea hongkongensis, cg: c. gigas, cv: c. virginica; § refer to the identity among the  <dig> crassostrea species: c. hongkongensis, c. gigas and c. virginica; † refer to the identity among the  <dig> mytilus species: m. edulis, m. trossulus and m. galloprovincialis.

amino acid identity in proteins for oyster pairs ranged from as low as 47% between cg-cv in nad <dig> to as high as  <dig> % between ch-cg in cox <dig>  the overall level of the identity among the three crassostrea species varied from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % , significantly lower than the corresponding values among three congeneric mytilus species. just as the gene order is less conserved than that in mytilus species, crassostrea species exhibit lower conservation of amino acid identity in all protein-coding genes . amino acid identity is also much lower than that found amongst five drosophila species  <cit> . according to our data , it appears that the most conserved protein-coding genes are cox <dig> and cox <dig> , and the least conserved are nad <dig>  nad <dig> and nad <dig>  in crassostrea.

gene order and pair analysis of genome rearrangements in crassostrea
it's well known that gene arrangements usually remain steady over long periods of evolutionary time , in contrast to the significant variation and rapid evolution of mtdna sequences  <cit> . with some exceptions, mitochondrial gene order is relatively stable within major groups, and generally variable among groups  <cit> . however, this appears not always to be the case in mollusks. while mt-gene rearrangements appear to be extensive in the major groups of mollusks, rawlings et al. reported that protein-coding gene rearrangements have occurred even within a genus , indicating that dramatic changes could also take place at the level of fine-scale phylogeny  <cit> . several possible mechanisms have been proposed to explain gene rearrangements in mt genomes, including tdrl and "intra-mt recombination" models. tdrl is believed to occur primarily in vertebrates, but it is likely to occur in mollusks as well, as exemplified putatively by the occurrence of the duplicated gene block cox1-cox2-atp8-atp <dig> and cox <dig> as an intermediate state in this process for dosidicus gigas and todarodes pacificus in cephalopoda, and also by the absence of the segment of trnas-duplicated rrna genes found in this study as a consequence in the proceeding for c. hongkongensis  <cit> . furthermore, the occurrence and subsequent differentiation of duplicated trna genes and rrna genes in some species  may be another consequence following this rearrangement. since this model cannot explain rearrangements in which a gene moves from one strand to the other, intra-mt recombination is thought to account for both these rearrangements as well as gene loss. theoretically, when two proximate double-stranded breaks occur and the dna circularizes to form mini-circles, segment loss often occurs; if the circular piece is re-inserted into the genome, inversion  is easily produced  <cit> . these seem to occur frequently in mollusks across groups and species.

according to available data, bivalves apparently have significantly great amount of mt gene rearrangement, with gene translocation across all gene classes and very few shared gene boundaries. on the other hand, loss of protein-coding genes is also a common phenomenon, as mentioned above. it is known that some mt protein-coding genes were gradually lost, functionally and then physically, over long evolutionary periods of time. physical loss of the atp <dig> gene, for example, was first detected in nematodes, and then in mytilus, crassostrea, m. yessoensis and male mitotype of v. philippinarum, although a remnant of its ancestral gene was detected in c. virginica  <cit> . functional loss of atp <dig> was revealed in female mitotype of v. philippinarum. in antarctic fish, even the nad <dig> gene was also lost  <cit> . based on the situation mentioned above, it could be possible, as more data become available, to find additional bivalve species lacking atp <dig> or other genes, provided these genes are replaced by functional gene transfer to the nucleus  <cit> .

genome rearrangement studies are based on genome-wide analysis of gene orders. the variation of mt gene order occurred in cassostrea were examined closely through pair analysis of genome rearrangements and direct comparison. it is shown that there are at least five permutations between c. gigas and c. virginica : indel of trnq <dig>  trnk and duplicated rrns; transposition of trnn; transpositions of trng, trnv andmnr; transpositions of trnk <dig>  trnc, rrns and mnr; and transpositions of trnd, trnm <dig>  trnm <dig> and trns <dig>  however, only one single permutation is inferred between c. gigas and c. hongkongensis, involving the indel of four trna genes  and two duplicated or split rrna genes , obviously. with three cassostrea mtdna genomes, it was supposed to be able to find ancestral genome scenario. however, the distinct feature  of c. hongkongensis mtdna genome prevented the analysis of reconstructing rearrangement: only the genes that all genomes involved have in common are considered for analysis, i.e. repetitions or gaps  in genomes are excluded. as gene order of c. hongkongensis and c. gigas would be the same if the indel between them is excluded, pair analysis of genome rearrangements in the three genomes would be actually conducted for two genomes  and hence no ancestral genome scenario could be found for cassostrea. clearly, the rearrangement distance of  <dig> between c. gigas and c. virginica is a great value within a genus, indicating a high degree of rearrangements. obviously, the distance between c. hongkongensis and c. gigas would normally be  <dig>  even without analysis.

the commonly occurred rearrangements are reversals and block-interchanges . however, the latter should be the dominant one in bivalves studied to date, because all these genomes have a single transcriptional orientation, except for l. ornata. clearly, the absolute majority of block-interchanges must have occurred in the "hot spot" region for the  <dig> cassostrea genoms . that if this is true in other cassostrea species could be verified when more mt dna genomes become available in the future.

codon usages and codon bias
a total of  <dig> amino acids are encoded by the c. hongkongensis mitochondrial genome, compared with  <dig> and  <dig> for its counterpart c. gigas and c. virginica, respectively. similar to these two counterparts, leucine  and serine  are the most frequently encoded amino acids, followed by valine  and phenylalanine ; arginine  is the least frequent. individually, uuu  is definitely the most frequently used codon not only in c. hongkongensis , but also in c. gigas  and c. virginica  as well, followed by auu  in the three species .

moreover, among  <dig> codons in c. hongkongensis,  <dig>  end in an a or t, a more pronounced percentage than that observed in the other two crassostrea species  but a phenomenon observed in the typical invertebrate codon bias. there is a strong bias against the use of c  at the third position nucleotide in all codons. in detail, for amino acids with a fourfold degenerate third position, codon families ending with t are the most frequently used, except in serine <dig> and arginine codons. codons ending with a are used next most frequently. this is also the case for twofold degenerate codons. in other words, in every case where an amino acid can be specified by any nny codon, the c. hongkongensis has a much higher proportion of nnt: nnc. at the second position, there is even a stronger bias in favor of the use of t , which is also true for c. gigas , c. virginica  and m. edulis . while at the first codon position, t  has the highest percentage followed by g , so are the cases in species mentioned above .

leucine can be specified by six different codons of ttr and ctn, and the proteins of the crassostrea species have a very similar number of leucines . as the reflection of base bias in codons, c. hongkongensis, together with c. gigas and c. virginica, has a significantly greater percentage of leucines encoded by tta and ctt codons , primarily at the expense of ctc and ctg codons. similarly, in the case of serine with  <dig> different codons , a much higher proportion  of at rich codons of tct, aga and tca are clearly observed in crassostrea congeners.

ribosomal rna genes
blast searches assigned locations of the 12s and 16s rrna genes in the c. hongkongensis mt-genome. the 12s rdna is contained in a  <dig> bp region  flanked by trnp and trny, and as seen in c. virginica, but in contrast to c. gigas, no duplicated small subunit rrna gene was detected. alignment of the 12s rdna from the three oysters shows that there is a fairly homologous core of  <dig> nucleotides at  <dig> % identity , corresponding to 6558– <dig> for c. hongkongensis, 3855– <dig> and 5931– <dig>  for c. gigas, and 6847– <dig> for c. virginica, respectively. however, if only c. hongkongensis and c. gigas are considered, the homologous core is  <dig> nucleotides long with  <dig> % identity, with two indels and  <dig> substitutions, corresponding to 6558– <dig>  and 3855– <dig> and 5931– <dig>  in the genomes, respectively.

the 16s rrna gene is  <dig> bp long, flanked by protein-coding genes cox <dig> and cox <dig>  unlike the 16s rrna gene in c. gigas and c. virginica mt-dna, it is not split or duplicated into two fragments   <cit> . the 16s rrna gene of c. hongkongensis and rrnl3' half of c. gigas shows nucleotide identity of  <dig> % over  <dig> aligned bases , while it is  <dig> % between c. hongkongensis and c. virginica over  <dig> nucleotide alignment . unlike the high identity of rrns among three crassostrea , there is low identity between rrnl <dig> and rrnl <dig>  in c. gigas, perhaps a consequence of rrnl's modest evolutionary fragmentation, rather than duplication  <cit> .

noncoding regions
as in other two oysters and mytilus, the c. hongkongensis mt genome includes a large number of noncoding nucleotides, in contrast to g. eborea. excluding the 3'utr sequences for protein-coding genes, there exist large intergenic segments in c. hongkongensis and  <dig> of which were larger than  <dig> bp in length. among these regions, a  <dig> nucleotide segment between trng and trnv was putatively identified as the major noncoding region , on the basis of its noncoding characteristics and a+t richness , a feature typically used for identification of the mitochondrial control region and thought to contain replication origin  <cit> . additionally, several n and n homopolymer tracts were contained in this region. the second largest intergenic sequence was a fragment between suppressor trna gene and trng, with a length of  <dig> bp and a+t content of  <dig> %. alignment of mnr between c. hongkongensis and c. gigas detected a fragment of  <dig> bp long, with  <dig> % sequence identity and a+t content of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, or a sequence of  <dig> bp in length, with  <dig> % identity, a+t content of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
although the arrangement of protein-coding genes of c. hongkongensis's mt genome is identical with that of c. gigas and c. virginica, and a moderate to high level of gene/amino acid identity is shared among the three crassostrea species, c. hongkongensis exhibits a high degree of variation in gene order and gene content. the most striking of these are the absence of the two trna gene trnc and trnn and duplicated or split rrna genes. based on a comparative analysis, we assume that the absence of these genes is the result of evolutionarily loss of a genomic segment that was present in the ancestor of crassostrea, and a likely case of "tandem duplication-random loss" for genome rearrangement. while this novel and interesting feature of c. hongkongensis and the comparison of mt-genomes among the three crassostrea species presented here have yielded useful insights into possible mechanisms underlying variation of gene order and gene content change for crassostrea, more information could be expected from mt-genome studies of other oysters in ostridae, promising intensive understanding of gene order/content change, as well as trna mutation and genome evolution for oysters and other bivalves.
