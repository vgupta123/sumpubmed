BACKGROUND
it has been estimated that more than a third of all eukaryotic proteins are subjected to phosphorylation  <cit> . the phosphorylation state of a protein can regulate functional properties including bioactivity, stability, sub-cellular localization, conformation and the ability to interact with other binding partners  <cit> . in mammals, several hundred kinases and phosphatases compete in a highly dynamic and spatially restricted fashion to control these post-translational modifications  <cit> .

for budding yeast  <dig> phosphatase and over  <dig> protein kinase like sequences  <cit>  regulate processes such as cell cycle, dna damage response, and signal transduction. for these organisms the network components of phospho-regulation are well defined and physically contained within one cell type however in multi-cellular organisms, the role of inter-cell communication and tissue specific expression comes into play. developmental stage and lineage specific expression of these proteins is used to regulate a diverse range of multicellular processes including immune response, differentiation, and memory  <cit> .

one major undertaking is the elucidation of substrate-enzyme relationships for these proteins  <cit> . protein arrays, yeast- <dig> hybrid and phage libraries have all been used as high-throughput methods to identify likely substrates for these proteins however they are far removed from a natural cellular environment and an interaction identified here may not occur in vivo. lower throughput screens by substrate trapping mutants and immuno-precipitation are more biologically relevant but are not realistic for mass screening of the proteome. by providing sub-cellular localization and tissue information we hope to make it easier for researchers to focus on the kinase or phosphatase most likely to be expressed in the same tissue and localized to the same compartment as the substrate of interest.

understanding the spatial expression of the phosphoregulators is also essential to build meaningful models of a mammalian protein phosphorylation network. many components display restricted expression, and require compartmentalization or transient association with sub-cellular structures in order to function appropriately. to address this we provide a database of the sub-cellular localization and tissue specificity of every protein kinase and phosphatase of mouse. sub-cellular localization is provided by a combination of literature review, bioinformatic prediction and a novel high-throughput sub-cellular localization screen. evidence for all localizations is provided and for the experimental localizations original images are displayed. for tissue specificity we provide an expression summary for the phosphoregulators in  <dig> normal mouse tissues by mining the expression data of the gnf gene atlas  <cit> . all of this is then combined into a simple interface that allows the user to query by gene name, tissue, compartment, pathway and classification.

RESULTS
sub-cellular localization of mouse protein kinases and phosphatases
the sub-cellular localizations recorded in phosphoregdb are compiled from three sources; newly reported experimental localizations from a simple pcr based tagging strategy, previously published localizations from a systematic review of the literature and bioinformatic predictions. using these sources a consensus description of the localization was made and supporting evidence provided for each decision.

a systematic review of the literature and mining of entries in the public localization database dbsubloc  <cit>  found published localizations for  <dig> protein kinases and  <dig> protein phosphatases. we extended the number of experimentally observed localizations to  <dig> and  <dig> respectively by epitope tagging full-length open reading frames from the fantom <dig> mouse gene encyclopedia  <cit> . using an overlap fusion pcr protocol we generated linear mammalian expression constructs from three fragments; a cmv promoter, a myc 9e <dig> epitope tagged open reading frame and two copies of the sv <dig> mrna polyadenylation signal. these constructs were then transfected into hela cells and localizations recorded by immunofluorescence after  <dig> hours . using this strategy we experimentally recorded the sub-cellular localizations of  <dig> kinase-like and  <dig> phosphatase-like open reading frames.

for the remaining  <dig> kinases and  <dig> phosphatases where we lacked full length clones, we used sub-cellular localization predictions from sublocv <dig> , proteome analyst, and membrane organisation predictions from tmhmm and signalp to provide a consensus prediction of the localization  <cit> .

by combining sub-cellular localization information from the above three approaches we produced consensus localizations for each protein. overall the protein kinases and phosphatases displayed very similar distributions . peptides localizing to the cytoplasm, nucleus or both accounted for more than 58% of all entries. the next largest groups were peptides localizing to the plasma membrane and those with multi-site localizations. the remainder corresponds to the small numbers of peptides that localize to other structures such as the endoplasmic reticulum, golgi, and cytoskeleton.

the observation of peptides in multiple localizations, was of interest in particular the large number with nucleo-cytoplasmic distributions. literature on these peptides reveals that of the  <dig> previously recorded peptides of this class,  <dig> actively shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and  <dig> of these are known to leave the nucleus in a leptomycinb sensistive/crm <dig> dependent manner  <cit> . we record this in the annotations and additionally provide predictions of nuclear localization signals  and nuclear export sequences  when found  <cit> .

tissue specificity of mouse protein kinases and phosphatases
to provide users with an estimate of tissue specificity of each protein kinase and phosphatase we mined the genomics institute of the novartis research foundation gene atlas  <cit>  for expression of these genes across a panel of  <dig> normal mouse tissues. from the gene atlas we extracted gc-rma normalised expression data for  <dig> probe sequences representing  <dig> loci. using a threshold for detection of  <dig> relative expression units as described by su et al.  <dig>   <dig> of the  <dig> loci had detectable expression in at least one tissue. the  <dig> loci with uninformative probes were excluded from further analysis however some of these are likely to represent tissue specific transcripts from tissues not sampled in the gnf gene atlas.

comparing the expression patterns of the  <dig> loci with signal above threshold we observed clusters of tissue specific genes. we hierarchically clustered the genes and tissues using pearson correlation and visualised the trees using genespring  <dig> . this largely split the data into clusters of tissues of related lineage. three major clusters identified were immuno-related , developing embryo  and nervous tissue  .

the overall tissue specificity of the dataset was then assessed by examining how many tissues each gene was expressed in . in total  <dig> of the set were detected in all  <dig> tissues while  <dig> were detected in only one tissue . to further assess tissue restriction we split the genes into bins based upon detection in 1– <dig>  11– <dig>  21– <dig>  31– <dig>  41– <dig>  51– <dig> or  <dig> tissues . using this we show that the majority of phosphoregulators show some form of restricted expression, similarly when we sub divide the set into kinase and phosphatase they show similar levels of restriction.

relationships between localization and classification with tissue restriction
one question we sought to answer was whether kinases or phosphatases localizing to a particular structure or belonging to a particular class were more likely to be expressed in a restricted fashion. for example, we expected cell surface receptors used for cell to cell communication to be more likely to be expressed in a restricted pattern than those localized in the cytoplasm or nucleus. to address this question we again binned genes based upon the number of tissues they were detected in and then overlaid them with broad classifications of substrate specificity; serine/threonine kinases, tyrosine kinases, serine/threonine phosphatases of the ppp and ppm groups and dual specificity/tyrosine phosphatases . similarly we compared number of tissues detected in with the sub-cellular localizations nuclear, cytoplasmic, plasma-membrane and nucleo-cytoplasmic .

although the overall tissue specificity of the kinases and phosphatases is similar  we identified some general trends in the tissue distribution of different classes and localizations . the greatest difference was observed between kinase classes, 38% of tyrosine as compared to 24% of serine/threonine kinases were restricted to  <dig> or fewer tissues . similarly for the phosphatases, more than two thirds  of serine/threonine phosphatases were widely expressed across  <dig> or more tissues as compared to 50% for the dual specificity and tyrosine phosphatases .

considering proteins with different localizations , the cytoplasmic, nucleo-cytoplasmic and plasma membrane proteins all showed similar distributions while the nuclear proteins appeared slightly less likely to be restricted to  <dig> or fewer tissues . despite the observed differences in distributions, only the difference between kinase types appears to be statistically significant using chi squared tests for equality of distributions .

integrated interface
phosphoregdb is based on a customised version of the mouse protein sub-cellular localization database locate  <cit> . in addition to expression and localization information, we have also provided extensive cross references into other relevant data sources. kinase specific resources include links into the phosphoelm database of reported kinase substrate relationships  <cit>  and the protein kinase resource  integrated database of protein kinase sequence, structure and domains  <cit> . we also place the enzymes in the context of pathways by mappings into the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  <cit> . further potential substrate and interaction relationships are extracted from the public protein:protein interaction databases bind and mint  <cit> . for each of these associations, the nature of the interaction is recorded, and a link provided to the original database.

throughout the database mgi nomenclature is used to ensure consistent use of gene symbols  <cit> . users can either use a simple query by symbol, synonym or keyword to retrieve entries or they can use the advanced search options. on the advanced page users can query by protein identifier , classification, pathway, sub-cellular location or tissue. alternatively more complex queries combining all of the above can be formed  .

CONCLUSIONS
by combining classification, expression and sub-cellular localization of all protein kinases and phosphatases we have produced a useful resource for querying the global characteristics of these components. it allows users to query where these molecules are expressed at both the sub-cellular and tissue resolution and reveals higher order relationships between expression, classification and localization. the observation of higher tissue specificity for tyrosine kinases has been suggested previously by the observed lack of these proteins in yeast and their expansion in metazoans  <cit> . however a system wide review of their expression and localization has not previously been described. despite the observation that tyrosine specific kinases are more likely to be restricted in expression, the trend is more subtle than that and we observe both ubiquitous and restricted expression patterns for kinases and phosphatases from all classes and sub-cellular localizations.

the observed tissue restriction for these proteins has important implications for modelling the system and for elucidating substrate-enzyme relationships. only 30% of the enzymes were detected in all  <dig> tissues of the gnf gene atlas, leaving 70% with some level of tissue restriction. when attempting to identify the kinase or phosphatase responsible for a given activity, the tissue restriction of the target and candidate enzyme should be considered. with the move towards systems biology, models need to consider whether they are dependent upon tissue specific components and in so doing report the cell types for which the model is valid.

finally, we have highlighted the need to consider physical co-location of enzyme and substrate at the level of tissue distribution and sub-cellular compartment in designing realistic models of these systems. however dynamic changes in sub-cellular distributions add another aspect of complexity to the system. regulation of sub-cellular localization, by post-translational modifications including phosphorylation is used to regulate access of enzyme to pools of substrate  <cit> . the next stage in this process will be to assess these dynamic changes in localization upon various stimuli and during the cell cycle.
