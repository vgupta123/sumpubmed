BACKGROUND
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies , or prion diseases, are fatal neurological disorders of humans and other mammals that are characterized by accumulation of an abnormal, protease-resistant isoform of the prion protein in the brain. naturally occurring prion diseases may have acquired, inherited, or sporadic origins . tse outbreaks have arisen in several species and include creutzfeldt-jakob disease  and kuru in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy  in cattle, scrapie in sheep and goats, chronic wasting disease in deer and elk, feline spongiform encephalopathy in cats, and transmissible mink encephalopathy in farmed mink . cattle with bse have been implicated as the cause of one human tse, variant cjd, through the consumption of beef from affected animals  <cit> . orally-acquired bse has also been implicated as a cause of bse in captive wild animals including: big cats, nonhuman primates, spiral-horned antelope, oryx, and bison  <cit> . thus, cross-species transmission of tses may extend across subfamilies and superorders. although there is no evidence of sheep scrapie transmission to humans in more than  <dig> years of exposure  <cit> , uncertainties associated with species barriers have prompted many countries to develop policies aimed at eliminating all tse-affected animals from their food chains, including scrapie in sheep.

in sheep, distinct prion protein  isoforms are associated with differences in scrapie susceptibility or disease progression. increased resistance to classical scrapie is associated with a prion protein gene  haplotype allele encoding alanine , arginine , and r at codon positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . conversely, a haplotype encoding valine , r, and glutamine  at those positions  is associated with increased susceptibility or attack rate  <cit> . haplotype alleles encoding three other forms of prp  have intermediate or unknown associations with classical scrapie disease progression following exposure to the transmissible agent . genetic testing for the five most common haplotype alleles  is a key feature of scrapie eradication programs  <cit> . management decisions depend on which of the  <dig> possible combinations of these paired prnp haplotypes  are present in an animal  <cit> . prnp diplotype scoring is further complicated by the presence of ark and trq haplotypes, where k is lysine and t is threonine. although infrequently observed overall, these haplotypes are important in some flocks  <cit> . when the known variation is accounted for, codons  <dig> and  <dig> each have multiple adjacent polymorphic sites and may encode up to four amino acids. this type of genetic structure has been recognized as a significant challenge for ovine prnp dna testing and assay design  <cit> .

codon variants at positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are not the only ones associated with scrapie resistance. an m112t variant on the arq haplotype has been associated with scrapie resistance in orally-inoculated suffolk sheep in the u.s.  <cit> . specifically, sheep with one or two copies of t112arq are resistant to development of classical scrapie when compared to those homozygous for m112arq. a m112i variant on the arq haplotype has also been reported, but it was not evaluated for association with disease  <cit> . m137t and n176k variants on the arq haplotype have been associated with scrapie resistance in intercranially-inoculated, orally-inoculated, and naturally-infected italian sarda breed sheep  <cit> . the existence of genetically resistant arq sheep raises the possibility of eradicating classical scrapie through genetic selection without using arr rams. for example, selection of sheep with t112arq, at137rq, or arqk <dig> alleles may be useful in purebred populations where arr rams are rare or unavailable.

other prnp codon variants associated with disease resistance include those for atypical scrapie and experimental bse challenge in sheep. atypical scrapie differs from classical scrapie in the agent's properties, genetics, and epidemiology  <cit> . prnp mutations associated with susceptibility to atypical scrapie include a l141f variant and a rare octapeptide repeat insertion  <cit> . also, experiments with intravenous bse challenge in sheep indicated that a p168l variant increased survival time  <cit> . thus, eight prnp codons and an octapeptide repeat have been associated with various forms of ovine prion disease, i.e. classical scrapie , atypical scrapie  and experimental bse . these variants are encoded by  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  and a  <dig> bp indel, and are surrounded by  <dig> other polymorphic sites. the prevalence of these polymorphisms in targeted flocks may influence the accuracy genetic testing, and ultimately, the management of scrapie eradication.

our goal was four-fold: 1) to develop an adaptive dna sequencing strategy for unambiguously determining the full length prnp coding sequence for any sheep; 2) to produce a set of reference sheep dnas for standardizing prion genetic testing; 3) to develop internally-controlled mass spectrometry  assays that accurately score codons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 171; and 4) to establish a set of reference dnas for discovering snps, estimating allele frequencies, and analyzing inheritance patterns.

RESULTS
a dna sequencing strategy for ovine prnp
the objective was to develop an adaptive strategy whereby both the maternal and paternal alleles were evenly amplified and accurately scored for a given animal. the initial design accounted for the existence of  <dig> polymorphisms and depended on amplifying a "primary" prnp amplicon and four additional overlapping amplicons . thus, unknown polymorphisms that could interfere with the amplification of the primary amplicon can be revealed in the sequences of overlapping amplicons and subsequently accounted for in additional rounds of pcr design. the primary dna fragment was  <dig> bp in length and included the entire  <dig> bp coding region. there were no previously known polymorphisms in the primer binding sites of this amplicon that could otherwise interfere with faithful allele amplification.

sequence analysis of  <dig> reference sheep of diverse types  revealed a number of previously unreported snps, however none interfered with primer binding sites of the  <dig> bp amplicon. in the  <dig> sheep sequenced,  <dig> previously unreported snps were identified and  <dig> animals had at least one heterozygous site in the  <dig> bp pcr fragment. this result indicated that both alleles were amplified in those sheep. the remaining  <dig> sheep sequences contained no heterozygous sites. however, their homozygous diplotypes were tentatively inferred to be correct based on the lack of evidence for allelic dropout caused by a common snp, and that 88% of these sheep had the two most common prion haplotypes: arq and arr . however, if there are reasons to suspect allelic drop-out in sheep with homozygous diplotypes, the four overlapping amplicons may be sequenced in those sheep to verify the primer binding sites of their primary  <dig> bp amplicons.

results from the group of  <dig> sheep presented here were combined with those available in the scientific literature  <cit>  and genbank  <cit>  to produce a static composite consensus map for a  <dig> bp region of prnp that included  <dig> polymorphisms,  <dig> of which are in the coding sequence . a dynamic map with breed frequencies, animal diplotypes, viewable trace files, and references was also produced and is available at: http://cgemm.louisville.edu/usda/index.html.

a novel l237p variant
of the  <dig> previously unreported prnp snps, three were located in the coding region and one was predicted to alter the prp amino acid sequence. this novel leucine 237proline  variant was discovered in a single composite ram while confirming its rare homozygous f <dig> diplotype. the most common alleles at position  <dig> encoded leucine . however the homozygous f <dig> ram was heterozygous at position  <dig> for a ccc allele encoding proline . this polymorphism occurred in the highly conserved glycosylphosphatidylinositol  signal peptide  region on c-terminus of the precursor prp . the functional significance of a l237p variant is unknown.

frequencies of prnp coding region polymorphisms
whereas the consensus map depicts polymorphic loci from all reported testing, the allele frequency histogram  depicts the amount of genetic diversity in the present group of  <dig> sheep. using scores from sanger sequencing trace files, the minor allele frequency  was calculated for all  <dig> polymorphisms in a  <dig> bp region encompassing the prnp coding region. two features were noted. first, the mafs of snps immediately adjacent to the coding region were generally higher than those in the coding region. second, only one coding snp  had a maf greater than  <dig> . the latter is consistent with the observation that many of these sheep were part of a scrapie eradication program in which r <dig> was selected for. in spite of the low overall mafs estimated for most of the  <dig> coding region snps, the minor allele for any of these sites may cause significant scoring errors depending on the genetic history of the flock and the design of the dna test.

frequencies of prnp codon haplotypes
haplotype and diplotype frequencies were tabulated for codon variants implicated in scrapie susceptibility and disease progression, i.e. at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . codon  <dig> was also included in the analysis. because the t <dig> allele was not observed in any animal, it was not included among the haplotype possibilities for these sheep. nine haplotype phases were unambiguously established for the  <dig> animals because they were either homozygous, had only one heterozygous site, or were part of the  <dig> tetrad families depicted in figure  <dig>  the remaining  <dig> sheep had two heterozygous positions, e.g. arr/ahq. haplotype phases were inferred for these  <dig> animals with the assumption that recombinant haplotypes were not present in these sheep. all  <dig> possible diplotype combinations of the six most common haplotype alleles at positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  were present in at least one animal in the group of  <dig> sheep. with the exception of arq, all haplotypes contained m <dig> and l <dig> alleles. of the arq haplotypes, those with t <dig> were only observed in suffolk, rambouillet, and composite rams; whereas those with f <dig> were only found in purebred dorset rams or composite animals. when positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were included in the analysis,  <dig> of the  <dig> possible diplotypes were present in the group of  <dig> sheep. individuals from this group of sheep were used to assemble a set of tissues and dna representing standard prnp diplotypes for dna testing.

an ovine reference dna panel for prnp genetic testing
first, a set of tissues was assembled from  <dig> healthy sheep representing all diplotype combinations of the six most common haplotype alleles at positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . second, tissues of three additional sheep were included to represent the diplotype combinations of codon  <dig>  that occur on the arq haplotype. third, tissues from sheep with four of six possible diplotype combinations of the three haplotype alleles known for codons  <dig> and  <dig>  that occur on the arq haplotype. the variants of the arq haplotype were included because alleles at positions  <dig> and  <dig> have been implicated in scrapie resistance and are available in our populations. the two remaining tissue sets needed to complete this collection are expected to be produced in the spring of  <dig> and available in the fall . approximately  <dig> to  <dig> kg of dna-rich tissues were collected from each animal sampled, thus providing a significant supply for wide-spread use. the complete prnp coding sequence has been determined for each of the  <dig> animals and deposited in genbank . in addition, a set of  <dig> highly informative autosomal ovine snps were scored to provide a genetic "bar code" for tracking these samples within and between laboratories and resolve sample mix-up issues where they occur .

an internally-controlled homogeneous mass extend -type maldi-tof ms assay for codon testing
a  <dig> bp prnp fragment was amplified from genomic dna for scrapie susceptibility testing. in addition to scoring the widely implicated codons  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  our assay was designed to score codons  <dig> and  <dig> to facilitate investigation of these alleles in scrapie infected flocks. the  <dig> bp fragment had no known polymorphisms in its amplification primer binding sites . accurate codon diplotype scoring for multiple adjacent snps was achieved in two reactions where both the sense and antisense dna strands were simultaneously scored in the same reaction. codons  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were scored in one multiplex reaction, whereas codons  <dig> and  <dig> were scored in another . although t <dig> was not present in the sheep tested, a synthetic dna control for t <dig> produced good results when added to dna amplified from homozygous a <dig> sheep. for codons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  scoring from either dna strand produced a complete diplotype. thus, when both dna strands were scored in the same reaction, concordance provided an internal diplotyping control. this was important because  <dig> other nearby snps were known to be present in eight of ten extension primer binding sites and may cause allele dropout in certain animals . scoring codon  <dig> required analysis of both sense and antisense strands to unambiguously infer the diplotype . in blind comparisons between diplotypes derived from sanger sequence versus those from hme maldi-tof ms, 100% concordance was observed for the  <dig> sheep from the scrapie control panel and the  <dig> parents from the diversity family panel . together, these hme assays provide one example of well-characterized high-throughput maldi-tof ms assays for scoring prnp codons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 

confirming relationships among  <dig> candidate families
a group of diverse rams were mated with ewes to produce families with twin lambs . autosomal snp diplotypes at  <dig> snp loci were used to confirm relationships among sheep from  <dig> candidate tetrad families. these snp loci included five from prnp and  <dig> at other sites distributed across the genome . analysis of the  <dig> maldi-tof ms diplotypes for all  <dig> candidate families  showed that mendelian inheritance patterns were present in  <dig> of  <dig> families. two families each had a single non-mendelian inheritance pattern attributed to a distinct snp. however, subsequent diplotypes scored from redundant sanger sequencing revealed that the two maldi-tof ms diplotypes were incorrect. this error rate  is well within the 99% accuracy expected for multi-plexed maldi-tof ms diplotype scoring and thus, the proposed family relationships in all  <dig> tetrad families appeared to be correct. the diverse group of sires for these families represents a minimal set of sheep and breeds for snp discovery and allele frequency estimation. their dams and offspring allowed haplotype phasing and verification of rare snps by allele segregation, features important for designing efficient and accurate dna tests.

discussion
commercial dna testing technology has advanced rapidly during the past decade and access to services has increased significantly around the world. the ultimate promise of livestock dna testing is to read an animal's dna sequence at birth and make accurate predictions about its future performance. for traits where known dna sequence variants have high predictive values, the challenge for dna testing service organizations still remains: develop efficient, economical, and accurate commercial tests for livestock producers. widely available and well-characterized sets of reference animals, tissues, dna, and genetic information facilitate the development of new tests and routine monitoring of quality control. however, for many laboratories it is neither feasible nor desirable to assemble a proprietary collection of reference samples. for example, the most efficient way to obtain some prnp diplotype combinations is by mating numerous rare sheep. the present report describes an adaptive prnp dna sequencing strategy for any sheep population, a set of  <dig> reference dnas for standardized prnp genetic testing, high-throughput assays for scoring five important prnp codons, and a family-based set of  <dig> reference dnas for discovering snps, estimating allele frequencies, and analyzing inheritance patterns. these are publicly available without restriction for ovine scrapie susceptibility testing, training, and research.

the ovine prion gene is likely the most sequenced gene in sheep, and novel snps with low maf are routinely discovered. the present strategy of sequencing overlapping amplicons for a  <dig> kb region of ovine prnp identified  <dig> previously unreported snps in  <dig> sheep . this approach was similar to that used for a  <dig> kb region of bovine prnp where  <dig> novel snps were discovered in  <dig> beef and dairy cattle   <cit> . the  <dig> previously unreported ovine snps included a l237p variant in the gpi-sp region of prp on the f <dig> haplotype. this result is intriguing because human mutations in this region segregate with cjd  <cit>  and the ovine f <dig> haplotype is strongly associated with atypical scrapie  <cit>  . surveys of atypical scrapie have shown that  <dig> of  <dig> cases  contain one or two copies of f <dig>  <cit> . although the status of codon  <dig> was not included in these reports of atypical scrapie, it would be useful to know if classifying the f <dig> haplotype into subtypes f141l <dig> or f141p <dig> affects the strength of association. in addition to prnp genetic testing, genomic dna now available from these and other haplotypes reported here may be useful for cloning specific prnp haplotypes for in vitro or in vivo experiments aimed at testing the relative effects of particular prp isoforms.

during the last ten years, more than a dozen reports of ovine prnp genetic testing systems have been described, including some that employed maldi-tof ms technology  <cit> . the maldi-tof ms multiplex assays described in this report provide an enhanced multiplex design that includes alleles not previously tested, scores alleles from both dna strands in the same reaction, and accounts for newly recognized nearby polymorphisms. this assay design may be useful for comparisons with other testing platforms or as a starting point from which to tailor genetic testing needs to specific populations. in addition to the ovine prnp snps tested here, other polymorphisms have also been associated with prion disease susceptibility, e.g. codons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and an octapeptide repeat insertion  <cit> . thus, maldi-tof ms assays presented here are an example of one design where others are possible.

lastly, this report describes a well-characterized set of  <dig> tetrad families that can be used for routine snp discovery, validation, and haplotype phase determination. its use allows confirmation of potentially complex multi-locus haplotypes to be resolved by segregation analysis. although we have employed it specifically for analyzing the prnp gene, it is generally applicable to any gene or region of the ovine genome.

CONCLUSIONS
the ability to identify prnp polymorphisms in any sheep provides critical information for designing efficient population-based scrapie genetic testing systems. combined with reference dna panels, these resources facilitate training, certification, and the development of new tests and knowledge that may expedite the eradication of sheep scrapie.
