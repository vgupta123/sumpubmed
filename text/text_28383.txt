BACKGROUND
linezolid is considered to as the last treatment option for infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , vancomycin-resistant enterococci and penicillin-resistant streptococcus <cit> . mutations in the drug target site  are the most common mechanisms of linezolid resistance. due to the low frequency of target mutation, the frequency of linezolid resistance is also relatively low
 <cit> . however, emergence of the transferable linezolid resistance gene, cfr, in clinical isolates poses a challenge in linezolid treatment. cfr gene encodes an rna methyltransferase, which modifies the adenine residue at position  <dig> of the 23s rrna gene and thereby confers resistance to phenicols, lincosamides, oxazolidinones, pleuromutilins, and streptogramin a antibiotics  as well as decreases susceptibility to the 16-membered macrolides spiramycin and josamysin
 <cit> .

since its first detection from a bovine staphylococcus sciuri isolate in 1997
 <cit> , cfr has been globally transmitted among different bacteria, such as staphylococcus spp., enterococcus spp., macrococcus spp., jeotgalicoccus spp., streptococcus suis, escherichia coli, bacillus spp., proteus vulgaris <cit> . this gene is widely distributed in the isolates of both human and animal origin, especially in china
 <cit> . a recent study has described this gene in farm environments
 <cit> . however, there has been no study on the distribution of cfr in retail meat. in the present study, we investigated the presence and the genetic background of this multiresistance gene in retail meat samples sourced from supermarkets and free markets of guangzhou, china.

RESULTS
identification of cfr-positive staphylococcus isolates
of the  <dig> retail meat samples tested, a total of  <dig> cfr-positive staphylococcus isolates were detected in  <dig> pork samples and  <dig> chicken samples. the  <dig> cfr-positive staphylococcal isolates included staphylococcus equorum , staphylococcus simulans , staphylococcus cohnii , and staphylococcus sciuri . in addition, one cfr-positive macrococcus caseolyticus isolate was obtained from a chicken sample. in total,  <dig> % and  <dig> % pork and chicken samples carried cfr-positive isolates, respectively.

clonal analysis of cfr-positive staphylococci and location of cfr
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  of  <dig> cfr-positive staphylococci revealed  <dig> major smai pfge patterns . eight s. equorum isolates showed five different pfge patterns, with two chicken strains from the same market presenting indistinguishable patterns. six distinct pfge patterns were identified for the seven s. simulans isolates, with only two pork isolates from different markets presenting similar pfge patterns. for the four s. cohnii isolates, three pfge patterns were identified, with two pork isolates from the same market presenting identical patterns. each of the three s. sciuri isolates exhibited distinct pfge patterns. in summary, most of the cfr-positive staphylococcal isolates were genetically distinct, but a clonal transfer of cfr-positive staphylococcal isolates had occurred either in the same or among different markets.

results of southern blotting indicated that  <dig> isolates harbored cfr in their plasmid dna . the remaining eight isolates appeared to carry cfr in their genomic dna; however, this assumption needs to be further confirmed by s1-pfge. only one cfr-carrying plasmid  that originated from a chicken isolate, tlkjc <dig>  was transformed into staphylococcus aureus rn <dig>  the transformant was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction  for cfr; it showed the same pfge pattern as that of staphylococcus aureus rn <dig> 

antimicrobial susceptibility of cfr-positive staphylococcus isolates and the transformants
all of the  <dig> cfr-positive staphylococcal isolates had elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations  against chloramphenicol , florfenicol , clindamycin , tiamulin , valnemulin , and linezolid  . in addition,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> isolates exhibited resistance to oxacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, erythromycin, rifampicin, and tetracycline, respectively. all isolates were found to be susceptible to vancomycin.

compared with s. aureus rn <dig>  the transformant carrying phnlkjc <dig> had elevated mics against chloramphenicol , florfenicol , clindamycin , tiamulin , valnemulin , and linezolid  , supporting the presence and the functional activity of cfr. in addition, the transformant carrying puc18-cfr exhibited 2-fold-elevated mics for chloramphenicol and florfenicol as compared to e. coli dh5α.

analysis of the genetic environment of cfr in the plasmid phntld <dig> and phnlkjc2
southern blotting confirmed that, in staphylococcus equorum tld <dig>  cfr was located on a plasmid designed as phntld <dig>  an approximately  <dig> -kb ecori fragment containing cfr was cloned and sequenced. a tn <dig> variant was identified on the plasmid phntld <dig>  in which parts of the tn558-associated transposase genes tnpa and tnpb were replaced by a cfr-carrying segment and the insertion sequence is21- <dig> . another resistance gene, fexa, encoding an exporter that mediates the active efflux of phenicols, was found to be located downstream of tn <dig> 

the sequences  <dig> -bp upstream and  <dig> -bp downstream of cfr on the plasmid phnlkjc <dig> were obtained by primer walking. basic local alignment search tool  analysis of these sequences revealed a 3′-truncated segment of the gene pre/mob upstream of cfr. further upstream, an incomplete rep gene was detected. analysis of the region downstream of cfr revealed the presence of a complete pre/mob gene. immediately downstream of the pre/mob gene, an incomplete macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b  resistance gene ermc was detected .

discussion
lack of previous studies on the distribution of the multiresistance gene cfr among staphylococci in retail meat led us to screen  <dig> meat samples for the same. in our analysis, cfr was detected in  <dig> samples. the detection rate was  <dig> %, which is higher than the detection rates of food animal samples in china
 <cit> . the low fitness cost of cfr acquisition observed in staphylococcal isolates may account for the persistence of this multiresistance gene in retail meat even in the absence of an antimicrobial selection pressure
 <cit> . the high detection rate found in this study suggested that cfr may be widely disseminated among staphylococci in the meats sold in china, increasing the possibility of this gene entering the food chain.

in this study, s. equorum  was the predominant species among the  <dig> cfr-carrying isolates obtained from animal food sources. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of cfr in s. equorum. s. equorum was originally isolated from the skin of horses and was later found to be the predominant species of staphylococci in sausages and cheese samples
 <cit> . s. equorum is used as one of the starter cultures in the preparation of smear-ripened cheese and cured meats such as sausages
 <cit> . since s. equorum present in retail meats has rare chances of coming in contact with antimicrobial agents, the origin and high prevalence of cfr in staphylococcus equorum is intriguing.

the cfr-carrying segment  on the plasmid phnlkjc <dig> from the chicken meat strain s. sciuri tlkjc <dig>  was found to be similar to the corresponding plasmid regions from different staphylococcal species such as the plasmid pss- <dig>  from a bovine s. cohnii strain and the plasmid pmsa <dig>  from a bovine mrsa st <dig> strain in china 
 <cit> . in addition, this cfr-carrying segment also showed high nucleotide sequence identity  to the corresponding region of plasmid pscfs <dig>  from a bovine s. sciuri in germany
 <cit> . the cfr-carrying segment  on the plasmid phntld <dig> from the pork strain s. equorum tld <dig> was identical to the corresponding segment of the plasmid phk <dig>  found in s. cohnii from human in china
 <cit> , the plasmid psa <dig>  extracted from a human clinical mrsa strain and the plasmid psepi <dig>  from a human clinical s. epidermidis strain in the united states
 <cit> , and the plasmid pss- <dig>  obtained from a porcine s. saprophyticus strain in china
 <cit> . these results indicated that the horizontal transfer mediated by mobile genetic elements such as plasmids and insertion sequences may contribute to the spread of cfr and suggested that it is possible to transfer cfr via mobile genetic elements from staphylococcal isolates of animal origin to the bacterial strains in the human body through meat consumption, posing a serious threat to the public health.

the mics of the cfr-positive staphylococci indicated multiresistance phenotype in these strains other than the phlopsa phenotype, suggesting limited therapeutic options to control these cfr-carrying staphylococci. most of the cfr-positive staphylococcal isolates showed low-level linezolid resistance with mic values ranging from  <dig> to 16 mg/l; this result is in agreement with previously reported linezolid mics among cfr-carrying staphylococci from farm animals and humans
 <cit> . in addition, five of the cfr-positive isolates had linezolid mic values of 2 mg/l, which is the same as the typical linezolid mic <dig> value and not consistent with mic value shifts observed for isogenic cfr-negative/positive staphylococcal strain pairs
 <cit> . this finding indicated that cfr, although present, is not functional or is partially silenced in some way
 <cit> . although staphylococcus strains isolated from meat samples showed low-level of linezolid resistance in the present study, emergence of the multiresistance gene cfr in meat poses a potentially significant threat to the public health, considering that the cfr-mediated linezolid resistance can rapidly and widely spread among different bacterial species.

CONCLUSIONS
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report a surprisingly high occurrence of cfr in retail meat samples in chinese markets. animal meat harboring bacteria containing the transmissible cfr would be a serious threat to the public health as these bacteria may act as reservoirs for spreading cfr to bacteria that infect humans, particularly in environments with a large microbial community. recently, cfr was detected in human isolates in china
 <cit> . thus, more attention needs to be paid to the possibility that cfr can find its way through the food chain to commensal or pathogenic bacteria of humans. considering that a limited number of meat samples were used and that to from only one city in china, the results of the present study regarding dissemination of cfr among staphylococcal species from animal food sources in china is not conclusive. thus, continuing the surveillance of cfr gene in meat distributed in china is critical to limit its dissemination, which could potentially threaten the human health.
