BACKGROUND
plants produce a wide range of proteinaceous inhibitors that protect them from the unwanted hydrolytic effects of endogenous enzymes as well as from those of infecting micro-organisms. recently, a new inhibitor protein with two independent binding sites designated as xaip  was isolated from scadoxus multiflorus  <cit> . this protein showed sequence homologies of 48% with heavamine, another plant protein with chitinase activity  <cit> , 39% with concanavalin   <cit>  and 11% with narbonin  <cit> . the latter two did not act as chitinases while their precise functions are still unkonown. xaip also showed a 36% sequence homology with xip-i  that inhibits xylanases gh <dig> and gh <dig>  it also lacks chitinase-like activity  <cit> . structurally, they all adopt  <dig> barrel fold. because of an extra α-helix α8' in the structures of these proteins, they all are classified into a sub-family of glycosyl hydrolyses 18c  as a part of the larger family of gh <dig> proteins that consists of mainly chitinases  <cit>  and various other proteins of unknown functions  <cit> . the proteins of sub-family gh18c show significant sequence variations while they adopt an overall similar scafolding. these proteins differ greatly in their functional specificities  <cit> . we report here a new form of xaip  which inhibits xylanase gh <dig> with a reduced potency whereas it binds to α-amylase with a considerably enhanced binding affinity as compared to xaip  <cit> . the two forms, xaip-ii and xaip show a sequence homology of 87% while 13% sequence variations occur mostly in the regions of ligand binding sites. the detailed structure determination of xaip-ii has allowed us to examine the reasons for the lack of chitinase activity, loss of carbohydrate binding capability, reduction in xylanase specific activity and significant increase in the potency of α-amylase inhibition.

RESULTS
sequence analysis
the amino acid sequence of xaip-ii shows a sequence homology of 87% with that of xaip . xaip-ii consists of  <dig> amino acid residues . the amino acid residue at position  <dig>  in generally different in xaip-like proteins indicating an important structural and functional role of this residue although it is same in the sequences of xaip-ii and xaip. interestingly, a neighbouring residue at position  <dig> is quite different in the two forms as it is alanine in xaip-ii whereas it is lysine in xaip  <cit> . the difference in the size of the side chains of two residues suggest that it may have significant local influence on the structure. the protein chain of xaip-ii is longer than that of xaip by one amino acid residue as ala <dig> is extra in xaip-ii. this is part of an important loop, pro <dig> - phe <dig> which is located between α-helix α <dig> and β-strand β <dig>  in the same loop, residues his <dig> and asn <dig> of xaip have been replaced by residues thr <dig> and ser <dig> in xaip-ii. the residues ser <dig>  gly <dig>  glu <dig>  arg <dig>  thr <dig>  lys <dig>  glu <dig> and his <dig>  have been replaced by ala <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  lys <dig>  ser <dig>  asp <dig>  thr <dig> and ser <dig> in xaip-ii. the sequence of xaip-ii shows an identity of 48% with the sequence of hevamine which is plant protein with chitinase activity. hevamine also belongs to glycosyl hydrolase  family 18c and has the characteristic combination of residues asp <dig>  glu <dig> and tyr <dig> for chitinase activity whereas the corresponding residues in xaip-ii are his <dig>  glu <dig> and tyr <dig> indicating a loss of chitinase activity. it may be noted that the sequence variations between xaip and xaip-ii are generally confined to the regions of binding sites .

determination of kd by surface plasmon resonance
the molecular interactions between xaip-ii and xylanase gh <dig> and α-amylase gh <dig> were studied in the real time using a biosensor based surface plasmon resonance   <cit> . the inhibitor protein xaip-ii was immobilized as a ligand on the dextran surface of a chip cm <dig> whereas the enzymes penicillium funiculosum xylanase gh <dig> and bacillus licheniformis α-amylase gh <dig> were used as the analytes over the surface. the sensograms for the interactions of xaip-ii with xylanase gh <dig> and α-amylase gh <dig> are shown in figures 2a and 2b respectively. the increase of resonance unit  from the base lines represents the binding of xylanase gh <dig> and α-amylase gh <dig> to the immobilized inhibitor protein. the plateau line represents the steady state equilibrium phase of the interactions between the inhibitor and the enzymes whereas the decrease in ru from the plateau represents dissociation phase. as seen from figures 2a and 2b, the dissociation phase is slower in the case of α-amylase  than that of xylanase  indicating a stronger interaction between xaip-ii and α-amylase gh <dig>  than that of xaip-ii and xylanase gh <dig>  as estimated using bia evaluation software  <cit> . this is in contrast to the earlier reports  <cit>  where the interaction of xaip and α-amylase gh <dig>  was weaker than that of xaip and xylanase gh <dig> . these spr data clearly show that xaip-ii like that of xaip inhibits both xylanase gh <dig> and α-amylase gh <dig> but the affinities of bindings have reversed indicating the significance of variations in the sequences of xaip-ii and xaip.

quality of the model
at the end of the refinement, the values of rcryst and rfree factors were  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. the overall geometry of the xaip-ii structure refined to  <dig> Å resolution was good with a molprobity  <cit>  score of  <dig> percentile. the average thermal b-factor was  <dig> Å <dig> while the  <dig> % residues were found in the most favored regions of the ramachandran plot  <cit>  as indicated by procheck  <cit> .

overall structure of xaip-ii
the polypeptide chain of xaip-ii adopts the triosephosphate isomerase  barrel folding with an eight stranded β-sheet that forms an inner circle while the nine α-helices constitute the outer loop . because of the presence of an additional α-helix α8'  this protein is grouped in the subclass of family 18c proteins  of the glycosyl hydrolases  family. there are two non-proline cis peptide bonds, gly33-phe <dig> and trp254-asp <dig> in the structure while one proline cis peptide bond, tyr160-pro <dig> has also been observed. the non-proline cis peptides belong to loops β2-α <dig> and β8-α8' respectively while the proline cis peptide is located in the β5-α <dig> loop. when the two structures of xaip-ii and xaip were superimposed on each other, the r.m.s. shift was found to be  <dig> Å. however, the superimposition of cα traces of xaip-ii and xaip shows an r.m.s shift of only  <dig> Å indicating that the polypeptide chains of two proteins show an overall similar conformations. however, the regions comprising helices, α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  β-strands, β <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig> and loops β2-α <dig>  α3-β <dig>  β5-α <dig> and α6-β <dig> show significant r.m.s shifts in their cα postions.

comparisons of the structures of xaip-ii and xaip
both molecules lack chitinolytic activity. both structures differ significantly in the regions of two interaction sites corresponding to xylanase gh <dig> binding site and α-amylase gh <dig> binding site. the structures show that the carbohydrate binding channel is relatively less obstructed in xaip-ii than that in xaip. the binding constant of xaip-ii with xylanase gh <dig> is less than that of xaip while the binding affinity with α-amylase gh <dig> is considerably enhanced.

carbohydrate binding channel
both xaip-ii and xaip maintain impaired carbohydrate-binding channels. the so called carbohydrate-binding site is formed with segments ala45-ser <dig>  ala6-phe <dig>  leu56-lys <dig>  gly76-gly <dig>  met252-tyr <dig> and cys22-ala <dig> . the prominent residues that determine the inner shape of the channel are phe <dig>  asp <dig>  his <dig>  pro <dig>  ala <dig>  trp <dig> and asp <dig>  the corresponding residues in the catalytically active hevamine are gly, asn, ala, gly, ile, trp and ser respectively. the presence of phe <dig> at the entrance of the channel in xaip-ii obstructs the entry of carbohydrates to the binding site. it may be noted that phe <dig> is one of the corner residues of a tight type i' β-turn conformation and the position of its side chain is locked at the observed site. on the other hand, the presence of inwardly protruding pro <dig> in the middle of the inner β-barrel blocks the channel passage right in the middle just before the positions of active site residues. as a result, the internal space of the channel is considerably smaller than that of chitinases  <cit> . as far as the differences between the impaired carbohydrate channels of xaip-ii and xaip is concerned, the most notable variation is observed in the proximity of chitin binding site where ala <dig> in xaip-ii has replaced lys <dig> of xaip. the structure analysis shows that the side chain of lys <dig> interacts with asn <dig>  asp <dig> and ser <dig> as well as with several solvent water molecules. on the other hand, ala <dig> in xaip-ii is oriented outwardly from the channel and hence does not exert any effect on the carbohydrate binding channel. therefore, one of the internal surfaces of the hydrophobic channel is relatively more rigid in xaip as compared to that of xaip-ii. in spite of repeated attempts of co-crystallizing xaip-ii with various chitin fragments including n-acetyl glucosamine monomer and other model sugar molecules, we did not succeed in getting crystals of the complex of xaip-ii with sugar. the soaking experiment also did not yield the desired crystals of the complex of xaip-ii with sugars indicating that the carbohydrate binding channel is not optimally formed in xaip-ii.

binding with xylanase gh11
in xaip-ii, the binding site for xylanase gh <dig>  is comprised of various segments of α-helices, α <dig> and α <dig> and loop α3-β <dig> . a simple docking analysis using discovery studio  <dig> , insight ii and o program  <cit>  shows that lys <dig>  lys <dig>  ser <dig> and asn <dig> of xaip-ii form at least four hydrogen bonds with glu <dig>  asn <dig> together with several van der waals interactions. it may be noted that the main interacting segment of xaip-ii with xylanase gh <dig> is the loop α3-β <dig>  the loop α3-β <dig> is considerably rigid in xaip-ii due to several intra loop interactions and hence lacks the freedom of getting induced fitting upon the binding of xylanase gh <dig>  the corresponding loop in xaip, on the other hand, is relatively flexible because it has only a few intra-loop interactions as a result it can be fitted well in the binding site of xylanase gh <dig> through induced fit. thus the number of hydrogen bonded interactions between xaip and xylanase gh <dig> are more than those between xaip-ii and xylanase gh <dig>  additionally, the side chain of his <dig> in xaip forms two hydrogen bonds with asp <dig> and pro <dig> of xylanase , while the corresponding thr <dig> in xaip-ii does not form any hydrogen bond. similarly, asn <dig> in xaip provides a superior hydrogen bond through asn <dig> oδ <dig> with asn <dig> nδ <dig> of xylanase than lys <dig> of xaip-ii with asn <dig> nδ <dig>  the calculation of free energy  <cit>  shows a higher value of - <dig> kcal/mol for the interactions between xaip and xylanase gh <dig> as compared to that of - <dig> kcal/mol for xaip-ii and xylanase gh <dig>  this is in full agreement with the dissociation constants of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m for xaip and  <dig>  ×10- <dig> m for xaip-ii which were determined using spr method.

binding with α-amylase gh13
the binding site for α-amylase gh <dig>  in xaip-ii is comprised of α-helices α <dig>  and α <dig>  and loops β6-α <dig>  and β7-α <dig>  . the most prominent difference is provided by the interaction of ser <dig> in xaip-ii which is part of a tight type iii' β-turn conformation. in contrast the corresponding tetrapeptide forms a type i' β-turn conformation with glycine residue at the equivalent site and lacks this important interaction. the molecular docking analysis carried out using discovery studio  <dig> , insight ii and o program  <cit>  shows that there are seven hydrogen bonds and a number of van der waals contacts at the interface between xaip-ii and α-amylase gh <dig>  in comparison to this xaip form only five hydrogen bonds and fewer van der waals contacts. a free energy calculation  <cit>  shows a higher value of interaction energy of - <dig> kcal/mol between xaip-ii and α-amylase gh <dig> as compared to the value of - <dig> kcal/mol for xaip and α-amylase gh <dig>  these values are also in agreement with the experimentally measured values of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m of the dissociation constants for the dissociations of xaip-ii and xaip respectively with α-amylase gh <dig> 

discussion
the xaip-ii and xaip are two forms of a protein that possess two independent interaction sites and inhibits two structurally unrelated enzymes xylanase gh <dig> and α- amylase gh <dig>  both xylanase gh <dig> and α-amylase gh <dig> hydrolyze plant related polymers xylan and starch respectively. similarly, both xaip-ii and xaip adopt stable tim barrel folds. however, interestingly with only a few differences in their amino acid sequences on the common tim barrel framework, the binding affinities of xaip-ii and xaip varied significantly. xaip-ii binds to xylanase gh <dig> with an affinity lower than that of xaip. the most important interactions of xaip with xylanase gh <dig> are provided by his <dig> whereas the corresponding thr <dig> in xaip-ii does not provide comparable interactions. the positioning of his <dig> in xaip is a result of a unique conformation of the tripeptide gly105-his106-ser <dig> with two important intra tripeptide hydrogen bonds, ser <dig> n --- o gly <dig> =  <dig> Ǻ and ser <dig> oγ --- o his <dig> =  <dig> Ǻ. in contrast, the corresponding residue in xaip-ii is thr <dig> which is positioned unfavorably due to an entirely different conformation of the corresponding tripeptide. the observed interactions clearly show that xaip binds to xylanase gh <dig> more favourably than that of xaip-ii. on the other hand, xaip-ii inhibits the function of α-amylase gh <dig> with a considerable higher potency as shown by the dissociation constant of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m whereas xaip inhibits it with a lower potency as the dissociation constant in this case is  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m. in this regard, it is pertinent to note here that the amino acid changes between xaip-ii and xaip have been observed primarily in the binding segments including loops α3-β <dig> and α4-β <dig> for the interactions with xylanase gh <dig> and in loops β6-α <dig> and β7-α <dig> and α-helices α <dig> and α <dig> for the interactions with α-amylase gh <dig>  the insertion of an extra residue alanine at position  <dig> in the α3-β <dig> loop and replacements of his <dig> by thr <dig> and asn <dig> by lys <dig> reduced both structural and chemical complementarities in xaip-ii with respect to the binding site in xylanase gh <dig> resulting in the formation of a less number of interactions with xylanase gh <dig>  on the other hand the replacements of gly <dig> by ser <dig>  glu <dig> by ser <dig>  glu <dig> by ser <dig> and his <dig> by glu <dig> made xaip-ii more compatible for the binding with α-amylase gh <dig> as compared to xaip.

the existence of isoforms of enzymes is well known  <cit>  and very often various organisms alter amino acid sequences in enzymes for altering their stereochemical arrangements for preventing the unwanted inhibitions of their functions. in this regard, the present example is one of the rare cases where the inhibitor proteins are found in more than one forms for protecting the host from the undesirable effects of hydrolytic enzymes presumably by alternating potencies so as to address the variations in the concentrations of enzymes xylanase gh <dig> and α-amylase gh <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we have determined the structure of a new form of xylanase gh <dig> and α-amylase gh <dig> inhibitor protein  at  <dig> Ǻ resolution. the xaip-ii structure with slightly altered stereochemistry of its two independent binding sites shows that it binds to xylanase gh <dig> less favorably as compared to xaip  <cit> . whereas its α-amylase binding site shows stronger interactions as compared to those of xaip. this specific interchange of inhibitory potencies demonstrates the potential of protein engineering by nature and allows us to have a deeper insight into the principle of selective replacements and insertions of amino acid residues in the proteins.
