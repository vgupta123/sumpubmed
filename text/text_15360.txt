BACKGROUND
in lymphocytes, after t or b cell receptor cross-linking, inositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate  is synthesized  <cit>  and induces ca2+ ion release from the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum , allowing the opening of ca2+ selective plasma membrane channels, known as store-operated channels . the resulting increase of the intracellular calcium concentration  allows activation of nfat   <cit> . inhibition of this store-operated calcium entry  by skf <dig> impairs t lymphocyte activation and subsequently interleukin  <dig> synthesis  <cit> . recent studies have described two proteins playing key roles in soce: stim <dig> and orai <dig>  stim <dig>  present in the er membrane, senses the luminal ca2+ concentration, and translocates near the plasma membrane during ca2+ release, where it directly interacts with orai <dig> protein forming the channel pore  <cit> . the r91w mutation of orai <dig> renders the channel non-functional, and is responsible of a severe immunodeficiency  <cit> . two orai <dig> homologue genes have been described, orai <dig> and orai <dig>  when expressed in hek <dig> cells , the three orai are able to produce or increase the soce  <cit> . however, despite their high homology, only orai <dig> is able to restore the soce of scid t cells  <cit> . furthermore, orai <dig> and orai <dig> could show slight differences in kinetics and pharmacology.

due to the key role of ca2+ influx in lymphocyte activation and proliferation, the use of effectors to modulate the orai1-containing channels has appeared as a new and promising way to modulate lymphocyte activities and could represent a new way for the treatment of inflammatory diseases  <cit> . although several pharmaceutical companies have developed molecules acting on soce, no specific soce effectors have been characterized  <cit> .

one of the most interesting and promising molecule is a boron-containing molecule, 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate . 2-apb was originally described as a plasma membrane permeant inhibitor of ip <dig> receptors in human platelets and neutrophils  <cit> , however it also impairs sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum ca2+ atpase activity at high concentrations , inducing a store ca2+ leak  <cit>  and directly blocks soce in the same range of concentration as for ip <dig> receptor inhibition  <cit> . furthermore, 2-apb has a dual effect on jurkat t cell soce: potentiation at low concentration  and inhibition at >  <dig> μm  <cit> . similar behaviour has been described on human t, rat basophilic leukemic rbl-2h <dig> and chicken b dt <dig> cells  <cit> . 2-apb is also able to activate members of the trp channel family at high concentrations  and to inhibit some others . the effects of 2-apb on soce has been extensively studied in t cells but data on other cell types of hematopoietic origin is poorly documented.

recently, several works have been published on 2-apb analogues. thus, several analogues of 2-apb  have been described and tested on platelets and cho cells, where 2-apb and analogues are only inhibitory  <cit> . on these cells, the boron-oxygen core  was shown not to be an absolute prerequisite for inhibition, but minor changes of the structure of 2-apb  <dig> as in diphenhydramine) result in the loss of soce inhibitory activity  <cit> . diphenylborinic anhydride  and  <dig> -diphenyltetrahydrofuran , two analogues lacking the aminoethyl group were still efficient showing that the aminoethyl group plays no role in soce inhibition by 2-apb at least in platelets  <cit> . more recently, mikoshiba's group realized the synthesis of 2-apb dimers, some of which demonstrated a 20- <dig> fold increase in inhibition capacity  <cit> . however, no structure-function studies have been performed on soce potentiation ability of 2-apb analogues.

the aim of this study was to identify which part of the 2-apb molecule is required for potentiation  of soce by using analogues modified in the three parts of the molecule: the boc, the ethanolamine group and the phenyl rings. we show that the boc is an absolute requirement for the potentiating ability of 2-apb , and that the number of phenyl rings is linked to the capacity of the molecule to potentiate/inhibit. we also confirm that the ethanolamine group is not required for potentiation and inhibition of soce in other cells.

RESULTS
dual effects of borinate esters  on soce
to visualize the soce, we treated the cells with  <dig> μm thapsigargin  in a ca2+-free medium during  <dig> min: this treatment allows the release of ca2+ ions from the er , and subsequently the opening of the store-operated channels . addition of  <dig> mm cacl <dig> then induced an increase of the intracellular ca2+ concentration  due to the entry of ca2+ ions through soc. as previously described in human jurkat t  <cit>  and chicken dt <dig> b cells  <cit> , 2-apb has dual effects on human bl <dig> b cell soce: potentiation at  <dig> μm , inhibition at  <dig> μm . as i is the result of an equilibrium between ca2+ ion influx and ca2+ efflux, we calculated a ca2+ ion influx rate when the ca2+ efflux is greatly reduced  <cit> . during the first 10- <dig> s after cacl <dig> adding, i is still low and the ca2+ pump activity to extrude ca2+ from the cell is greatly reduced, meaning variations of i are due to ca2+ ion influx. the rate was twofold increased in the presence of  <dig> μm 2-apb . in the presence of  <dig> μm 2-apb, the ca2+ influx rate was largely decreased  and the i increase after cacl <dig> adding was largely blunted .

these results were confirmed by indo- <dig> quenching experiments with mn2+ ions: as mn2+ ions enter the cells by the same channels as ca2+ ions, they can not be pumped back to the external medium by the plasma membrane ca2+ atpases  and lead to indo- <dig> fluorescence quenching at  <dig> nm  <cit> . after  <dig> min treatment by tg to open soc, addition of  <dig> μm mncl <dig> led to a rapid decrease of  <dig> nm fluorescence . the quenching was twofold increased in the presence of  <dig> μm 2-apb , but decreased with  <dig> μm 2-apb . in bl <dig> cells and the absence of tg, cacl <dig> addition induced a slight increase of i . thus, these experiments show for the first time that 2-apb directly acts on ca2+ ion entry through soc in the human b cell line bl <dig>  with dual effects, potentiation at low, inhibition at higher concentrations.

diphenylborinic anhydride  and 2-aminoethyl dibutylborinate  have also dual effects on bl <dig> cell soce . dpba, a 2-apb analogue with two pairs of diphenylborinate, has recently been shown to inhibit platelet soce  <cit> . in bl <dig> cells, when dpba was added, maximal potentiation of soce was observed at  <dig> μm, whereas inhibition was at concentrations higher than  <dig> μm . furthermore, dpba appeared to potentiate soce activity with a slightly greater efficacy than 2-apb . thus, bl <dig> cell soce was three times more sensitive to the enhancing and inhibitory effects of dpba than with 2-apb . these results were confirmed by indo- <dig> quenching experiments : mn2+ quenching was twofold accelerated with  <dig> μm dpba  and slowed by  <dig> μm .

2-abb, another 2-apb analogue where the two phenyl rings are replaced by two butyl groups, was further shown to have a dual effect on bl <dig> cell soce , with a maximum of potentiation at  <dig> μm , and inhibition at >  <dig> μm. potentiation capability was in the same order of magnitude than 2-apb's , but slightly weaker than dpba's . bl <dig> soce sensitivity to 2-abb is weaker than for dpba and 2-apb . indo- <dig> quenching by mn2+ ions confirmed this result:  <dig> μm 2-abb accelerated the quenching , when  <dig> μm slowed it .

differential effects of dimesitylborinic acid  and phenylboronic acid  on soce
as diphenylborinic acid is unstable, we chose dimesitylborinic acid  which is commercially available and stable. this compound is a 2-apb molecule without an ethanolamine group , and where the two phenyl rings are replaced by two mesityl groups. dmba was not able to potentiate soce at 2-apb potentiating concentrations, but clearly showed an efficient inhibitory capacity . indeed, dmba was close to the efficiency obtained with skf <dig>  another common soce inhibitor . the inhibitory capacity was confirm by mn2+ quenching of indo-1:  <dig> μm dmba ,  <dig> μm. . as 2-apb and dmba act in the same range of concentrations, we performed competition experiments. used at  <dig> μm, 2-apb was potentiating, dmba inhibiting . however, when dmba was added  <dig> s after cacl <dig>  in the presence of 2-apb , there was a clear and fast decrease of i to values obtained when dmba is used alone . inversely, when 2-apb was added  <dig> s after cacl <dig> adding in presence of dmba , there was no increase of i. thus, dmba could impair 2-apb-induced potentiation of soce, whereas 2-apb could not avoid dmba-induced inhibition of soce. this shows that dmba inhibits the soce and can bypass the 2-apb-dependent potentiation.

last we tested phenylboronic acid , which can be considered as a hemi-diphenylborinic acid. pba was devoid of either potentiating or inhibitory activity on soce , suggesting that the two phenyl or mesityl rings must be on the same boron atom to give activity to the 2-apb analogue.

2-apb analogues without the b-o core are not able to potentiate soce
thus, compounds containing a terminal b-oh  do not appear to behave like compounds containing a central b-o , suggesting a requirement of the boc for the potentiating activity of 2-apb analogues. to confirm this hypothesis, we performed experiments with 2-apb analogues devoid of b-o. several of these analogues  have been tested on platelet soce and described as inhibitors  <cit> . it has been hypothesized that the terminal amine and the boron of 2-apb could form an internal coordinate-bound, resulting in the formation of a ring .

diphenhydramine , an analogue without boron and where the terminal amine bears two methyl groups cannot form the internal coordinate . phenytoine  is an analogue with a third ring containing two ketone groups and two nitrogen atoms . diphenhydramine and phenytoin were weak inhibitors of bl- <dig> soce , and totally devoid of potentiation ability, as previously described on platelets .

 <dig> -diphenyltetrahydrofuran ), an analogue of the 2-apb ring form with a more neutral third ring, was a more effective inhibitor with a ki ~  <dig> μm, but was totally devoid of potentiating ability , as in platelets  <cit> . at  <dig> μm, dpthf was a slight inhibitor , more efficient at  <dig> μm  when used in mn2+ quenching experiments of indo- <dig> .

3--1-propylamine ) is a 2-apb analogue where the boc is replaced by a carbon-phosphorus core. this little change resulted in drastic consequences: dp3a was only inhibitory, with a ki similar to dpthf's . in indo- <dig> quenching experiments by mn2+ ions, dp3a was a weak inhibitor at  <dig>  and  <dig> μm , confirming its total absence of potentiating effect on the divalent ion influx . although dpthf and dp3a were only inhibitory, they were also less efficient, as higher concentrations were needed to get the same inhibition as done by 2-apb . this also confirms that the boc is not an absolute requirement to confer the inhibitory ability of the compound.

dual effects of borinate esters  are observed in other leukemia/lymphoma cell lines
as the most extensively studied soce is crac of t lymphocytes  <cit>  we tested whether the identified structure effects of 2-apb analogues were also relevant to t cells and other cell lines. as previously shown, 2-apb has dual effect on jurkat cell soce, potentiation at  <dig> μm and inhibition at >  <dig> μm 2-apb . soce of monocytic u <dig> cells was potentiated and inhibited by 2-apb in a similar way to bl- <dig> soce: potentiation at  <dig> μm, inhibition at >  <dig> μm . thus, the 2-apb dose-response curve obtained on jurkat cell soce showed a leftward shift, indicating a near three-fold higher sensitivity to 2-apb than b lymphocyte bl41's and monocytic u937's. dose-response curves obtained with bl <dig> , thp <dig>  and nb <dig> cells  were similar to bl41's and u937's . these results indicate that the previously reported effects of 2-apb on human t cell soce  <cit>  can also be observed in other cell types of hematopoietic origin.

dpba was also  <dig> fold more efficient than 2-apb in jurkat and u <dig> cells . remarkably, jurkat cells remained three times more sensitive to dpba than the other cell lines, as with 2-apb .

2-abb had the same dual effect on u <dig> and jurkat cell soce . as with bl <dig> cells, u <dig> and jurkat cells were 2- <dig> fold less sensitive to 2-abb than to 2-apb . like with 2-apb and dpba, jurkat cell soce was three-fold more sensitive to the 2-abb than bl <dig> and u <dig> soce. thus, jurkat cell soce is 2- <dig> fold more sensitive to borinic ester potentiation and inhibition than other cell soce.

orai isoform expression
soce is directly dependent on orai protein expression. three orai isoforms have been characterized in human cells and exhibit different sensitivities to 2-apb when over-expressed in hek  <dig> cells  <cit> . we studied orai isoform expression in our cell lines by using qrt-pcr. as shown in figure  <dig>  the three cell lines expressed different amounts and ratio of the three isoforms. thus, although orai <dig> is the main isoform in jurkat t cells at the mrna scale , orai <dig> is the main isoform in bl <dig> b cells and u <dig> monocytic cells express mainly orai <dig>  with a slightly weaker amount of orai <dig>  noteworthy, bl <dig> b cells do not express orai <dig>  thus, the difference of orai expression could be responsible of the sensitivity difference to 2-apb/borinate ester dual effects in our cell lines. even if the orai <dig> mrna is not the main orais mrna, the soce is almost abolished at  >  <dig> μm in the three cell lines, meaning orai <dig> proteins form the main channel.

borinate esters are also ca2+ release inhibitors
to test the soce-specificity of the 2-apb analogues, we performed the same kind of experiment, except that the cells were stimulated with an anti-igm antibody instead tg. in these conditions, anti-igm antibodies induce synthesis of ip <dig> and ca2+ ion release through ip <dig> receptor of the er  <cit> . at their maximal soce potentiation concentration, the three borinate esters already impaired the ca2+ release by the er .

dmba at  <dig>  and  <dig> μm was also able to totally block the ca2+ release by the er, in a range of concentration similar to concentration needed to block the soce . in contrast, at a concentration with almost no effect on soce ,  <dig> μm dp3a tightly blocked the ca2+ release .

discussion
in this work, we clearly show that 2-apb is able to exert dual effects  on the ca2+ influx of various cell lines of hematopoietic origin, and may be considered as the parent of a new family of molecules with this dual efficacy. we were able to define which part of the 2-apb molecule is required for potentiation and/or inhibition of the ca2+ influx through store-operated channels. despite the same kind of activity in hematopoietic cell lines, a slight difference in sensitivity to 2-apb and its analogues can be observed, and could be due to the relative expression of the three orai proteins.

though 2-apb is a small molecule, three parts can be distinguished: an ethanolamine chain, a boron-oxygen core  and two phenyl rings. the presence of a boron atom with an amine chain allows the formation of an internal coordinate, but the boron atom is also able to interact with n and o atoms of amino-acids, as shown in the case of bortezomib binding to proteasome  <cit> . the use of analogues helped to understand which part of the 2-apb is important to inhibit soce of platelets  <cit> , but nothing was known about the potentiation process, as platelet soce is clearly not potentiated by 2-apb and analogues.

dpba had been previously used and was known as a five fold more potent inhibitor of platelet soce than 2-apb , meaning the ethanolamine group plays no role in soce inhibition . dpba could also activate some trp channels at concentrations >  <dig> μm  <cit> . in our experiments, dpba is ~ <dig> fold more efficient than 2-apb, and is able to potentiate the ca2+ influx. thus, i variations are increased by 200-250% at 3- <dig> μm, concentrations without any known effect on trp channels. as dpba does not possess an ethanolamine group, this confirms that this group plays no role in potentiation process.

2-abb, a compound never used in ca2+ signalling, is an analogue of 2-apb where the two phenyl groups were replaced by two butyl. on the three cell lines, we found that 2-abb, like 2-apb and dpba, has dual effect on ca2+ influx, meaning that the two phenyl rings are not an absolute requirement for potentiation and inhibition processes. however, 2-abb is less potent to potentiate and inhibit soce than 2-apb and dpba. a clear correlation seems to exist between the number of phenyl rings in the molecule and its ability to potentiate/inhibit soce: dpba  > 2-apb  > 2-abb . thus, it seems that the phenyl rings do not play a direct role in potentiation, but rather favour it. we can assess that after the binding of 2-apb to the channel protein by the boc, the two phenyl rings strengthen the binding by a second interaction. in dpba, the presence of four phenyl rings reinforces this binding. it was previously shown that addition of a phenyl ring to the 2-apb molecule could increase its inhibitory efficacy on platelet soce  <cit> . dimers of 2-apb  had been recently shown to have higher ability to inhibit soce than 2-apb  <cit> .

it is also remarkable that the ratio between the concentrations of compound to have maximal potentiation, and to have inhibition is similar with the three borinate esters : 2-apb  <dig> μm/ <dig> μm, dpba  <dig> μm/ <dig> μm, 2-abb  <dig> μm/ <dig> μm : this clearly shows that potentiation and inhibition are linked. interestingly, 2-abb is the first described soce inhibiting molecule without any structural rings.

sensitivity to potentiation/inhibition by borinate esters varies among cell line soce: thus, these compounds are three fold more potent on jurkat cell soce. using qrt-pcr, we showed the the cell lines used in this study do not express the same orai proteins, and in different ratios . thus we confirmed that the main orai protein expressed by jurkat t cells is orai <dig>  <cit> , although bl <dig> cells express mainly orai <dig>  and u <dig>  a mix of orai <dig> and orai <dig> . of note, in b cells from patient with a non-functional orai <dig> inducing a scid, soce is not abrogated as in t cells, but decreased, allowing a partial nf-at activation  <cit> . this could be due to the fact that b cells express significantly more orai <dig> than orai <dig> proteins, and orai <dig> proteins could play a role in b cell soce. however the role of orai <dig>  in soce is controversial: although orai <dig>  could form soce when over-expressed with stim <dig> in hek <dig> cells  <cit> , heterologous expression of orai <dig> in scid t cells cannot restore soce  <cit> . while orai <dig> has been clearly shown to encode the soc pore in many cells, a recent work showed that orai <dig> is the soc pore of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cell lines, in contrast to estrogen receptor negative cell line which use orai <dig>  <cit> . the role of transient receptor potential canonical protein  in forming store operated channels with orai <dig> protein is also controversial: some authors show a clear association  <cit> , when others found none  <cit> . as 2-apb is a known inhibitor of trpc <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> channels  <cit> , we cannot rule out that in b cells, trpc proteins form the store-operated channel pore in association with orai <dig>  and play a role in the soc pharmacology.

since the molecular characterization of orai <dig>  <cit> , orai proteins have been fully studied in heterologous expression system  <cit> . although these systems allow easier characterization, due to larger currents, they should be used with care. thus, in one of the first studies reconstituting soce with orai <dig> and stim <dig> over-expression in hek <dig> cells, it was shown that 2-apb was able to inhibit soce but not to enhance it . thus, in over-expressing system with large amount of orai <dig> and stim <dig> proteins, inducing large increase of i , 2-apb is not potentiating. furthermore, the expression levels of orai <dig> and stim <dig> have been shown to affect the ca2+ conductance and the potentiation of the currents by 2-apb  <cit> . the use of recombinant orai/stim seems to be accurate for the study of drugs with inhibition ability, but not for drugs with potentiating ability. furthermore, soce is a large family, with different kinetics and pharmacological properties, and the expression of orai <dig> and stim <dig> can not reconstitute the different types of soce, because all the partners forming a soc are not known yet . the use of cell lines to study the pharmacology is complementary to the use of recombinant system, but crucial to identify new compounds with potentiating ability.

the presence of a boron-oxygen link in a molecule does not mean that a compound has potentiating ability on soce. dmba, which resembles 2-apb without the ethanolamine group but a terminal hydroxyl group bound to the boron atom, has shown great capacity to block soce, without any potentiating effect. the dipeptidyl boronate pyrazylcarbonyl-phe-leu-boronate, also known as ps- <dig> or bortezomib  is a well known inhibitor of proteasome used in the treatment of multiple myeloma. its pharmacophore is a terminal boron atom with two hydroxyl groups  <cit> . bortezomib blocks protein degradation by binding to the terminal threonine of 20s core particle with a ki <  <dig> nm  <cit> . remarkably, the same molecule without the boron atom  largely loses its proteasome inhibitory capacity   <cit> . boron atom presence is also an absolute requirement in serine protease inhibitors  <cit> . thus, the same kind of relationship seems to exist between soc protein/2-apb and proteasome/bortezomib.

the absolute requirement of the boron atom for potentiation was confirmed by dp3a. despite its closely related structure to 2-apb', dp3a had never been used in ca2+ signalling before this work. remarkably, this compound where a p-c core replaces the boc present in 2-apb, has lost its ability to potentiate soce of hematopoietic cell lines . this result clearly highlights the key role of the boc in the potentiation ability of 2-apb. however, dp3a is still inhibitory even if higher concentrations are needed to inhibit soce than 2-apb. thus, replacement of the boc in the 2-apb molecule impairs the ability of the molecule to potentiate soce and decrease its capability to inhibit it. it also confirms that the boc is not required for a molecule to be inhibitory, as shown previously with dpthf  <cit>  and in the present work .

the dual effect of borinate esters on soce is complex to analyse because the binding sites of 2-apb are not clearly established yet. thus, before the discovery of orai <dig>  the study of the t cell soce, characterized the dual effect of 2-apb and the authors hypothesize the existence of two binding sites, one potentiating with high affinity, the other one with lower affinity and inhibitory  <cit> . the inhibitory target of 2-apb seems to be stim <dig> itself  <cit> , but 2-apb can also bind to the selectivity filter of the orai protein, widening the size of the pore, resulting in potentiation of the current  <cit> . however, the same authors provide an alternative explanation where 2-apb interacts with the crac channels to widen the channel pore, and when more 2-apb interact with the channel, a change of channel conformation may prevent ions to pass through it. furthermore, soc are made with four orai proteins, meaning a soc has potentially four 2-apb binding sites, and nothing is known yet about how many 2-apb molecules are required to widen the pore or to block it. our work could provide new tools to study 2-apb binding sites. thus, dmba is a compound able to counteract the potentiating effect of 2-apb. our preliminary results with dmba/2-apb competition could not explore the binding sites of the molecules, but we could make two main hypothesis:  dmba and 2-apb have the same binding site. as dmba impaired 2-apb potentiating effect, and 2-apb can not remove the dmba inhibition, we could think that dmba has a higher affinity for the binding site than 2-apb.  dmba and 2-apb have two different binding sites and binding to the inhibitory binding site  bypasses the potentiation binding site. interesting is the case of orai3: orai <dig> channels do not need stimulation by stim <dig> to be opened, and 2-apb has only potentiating ability. if dmba binds to stim <dig>  it should have no effect on orai <dig> currents. recently, it has been discovered for the first time that a physiological soce could be mediated by orai <dig> proteins . it will be therefore interesting to test the effect of dmba on these breast cancer cells.

however, all the compounds used in this study are not soce specific, as they also exert ability to inhibit the ca2+ release by the er. thus, when borinate esters are at their maximal potentiating concentration, they are already at a concentration fully inhibiting the ca2+ release , impairing their future use as specific immune-modulator.

CONCLUSIONS
the results from the present study clearly highlight the role of the boron-oxygen core in the ability of borinate ester molecules to potentiate ca2+ entry in hematopoietic cells. the design of potentiating compounds requires the absolute presence of a boc, whereas design of inhibitors does not. strikingly, terminal b-oh could give high inhibitory ability to molecules . this work could represent the first step for the development of new molecules with immunomodulatory properties: thus, a potentiating compound could be useful to enhance responses of blood cells from immunodeficient patients, or to increase ca2+ toxicity in leukemia cells.
