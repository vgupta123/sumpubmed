BACKGROUND
in the last decade, gene expression profiling microarrays have been widely used in animal genomics and this technique has enabled researchers to monitor, on a broad scale, the effects of pathogens on host cells and tissues, aiming to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the host-pathogen interactions. mastitis is one of the most costly diseases of the dairy industry, which makes it among the major concerns for the livestock sector  <cit> . as a consequence, numerous gene expression studies on mastitis in different host species infected with various pathogens are publicly available. however, due to the high costs of this approach, most individual studies have been carried out on limited numbers of technical and biological replicates. furthermore, different and improved microarray platforms have been used over time, due to the increased availability of improved microarray tools tailored to the genome sequence of most livestock species.

meta-analysis can be used to combine or integrate the data or results of independent studies. it allows a more objective appraisal of evidence than individual studies and has been widely used to interpret contradictory results from various studies or overcome the problem of reduced statistical power in studies with small sample sizes . the applicability of meta-analysis to microarrays was initially demonstrated by  <cit> . subsequently, several different meta-analysis applications have been developed in order enable the integration of independent microarray expression studies, e.g. through the combination of effect sizes  <cit> , the comparison of data intersections   <cit> , the integration of data from affymetrix arrays through re-annotation and common pre-processing methods  <cit> , the quantification of similarities in the literature   <cit> , the development of a ranking aggregation approach  <cit> , and the application of improved and meta-analysis adapted normalization methods  <cit> . meta-analysis methods have also been applied to characterize the properties of promoters to regulate transcription of up-regulated genes  <cit> .

as p-values are usually available for each gene in each study, the main focus of the current meta-analysis approach was to increase the reliability of statistical evidence, by combining p-values across several, often heterogeneous, experiments. various statistics have been suggested to combine p-values  <cit> . in particular, the meta-analysis tool chosen for this study, pointillist  <cit> , uses and extends the fisher inverse chi-square method for p-value combination  by calculating different weights  that are used to transform the p-values of each experiment. by doing so, pointillist takes into consideration the various experimental design differences and the high heterogeneity of the datasets, including the use of different platforms, that has been a major hindrance to meta-analysis so far.

the large quantity of microarray data available for mastitis in ruminants provides an attractive opportunity for a meta-analysis approach. gene expression commonalities shared across pathogens and host species may contribute to understanding the disease and its physiology, as well as pinpoint the most promising direction of research to identify effective biomarkers. indeed, several innate immune responses, especially to pathogen-associated molecular patterns, show evolutionary conservation, thus increasing the feasibility of meta-analysis of gene expression data across species  <cit> . in controlled in vitro cultures of macrophages  <cit>  and dendritic cells  <cit> , a similar shared induction of common gene expression patterns in responses to a broad range of bacteria has been observed. furthermore, previous meta-analysis results  <cit>  showed common clusters of affected genes across larger numbers of pathogens and studies.

the aim of this project was to identify common sets of differentially expressed genes regulated by three mastitis pathogens  in three affected ruminant species . economy-wise, these three species are by far the most important for the dairy industry. for this purpose we used the program pointillist  <cit>  and, by combining similar time points of different experiments, we created four main lists of genes differentially modulated by mastitis infection. in vitro experiments were treated in the same way as in vivo experiments as the weighting mechanism of pointillist provided protection against potential response-dependant biases.

we then used the ingenuity pathways analysis  software to retrieve the canonical pathways, biological functions and networks that were most significantly associated with the lists of affected genes. ipa is a curated database and web-based analysis system that delivers an assessment of signaling and metabolic pathways, molecular networks, as well as key biological and disease processes that are most significantly perturbed in a gene set of interest. for each meta-analysis combination tested with ipa, the five most affected canonical pathways and the five most affected biological functions belonging to the sub-group "molecular and cellular functions" are discussed in detail.

all the meta-analysis combinations highlighted a predominance of gene pathways and biological functions related to immune response and to lipid metabolism. the results show common but also combination-specific affected genes and pathways and provide new avenues for future studies.

RESULTS
combination of time points of mastitis experiments with pointillist
different combinations of time points from individual experiments  were selected to represent four main categories of response to mastitis infection. these combinations were performed with pointillist and were named:  overall response,  early stage response,  late stage response, and  cattle-specific response . no goat- or sheep-specific responses were studied because of the more limited number of experiments and time points for those species.

combination of microarray data from a total of  <dig> different experiments and  <dig> different time points  to analyse  <dig> different responses to mastitis infection:  overall response,  early stage response,  late stage response, and  cattle-specific response.

the combination  overall response included each animal species  and all the time points  in order to capture the heterogeneity of all datasets. in order to avoid bias towards cattle, for which more datasets were available, the list of combined p-values, or so-called "combined effective significances", for each probe was obtained by a stepwise process. first, species-specific p-value lists were obtained. a single pointillist run was applied to obtain the goat-specific  and the sheep-specific  p-value lists. to obtain the cattle-specific p-value list,  cattle-specific response, two pointillist processing steps were required. firstly, the time points for each separate bovine microarray experiment, e.g. 1a , 1b , 1c ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  were analyzed separately with an initial pointillist run. subsequently, the resulting p-values of each experiment were combined with a second pointillist run. the final combined p-values for  overall response were obtained by combining with an additional pointillist run the three species-specific p-value lists.

the combined p-value lists for  early stage and  late stage responses were obtained by combining the time points for which respectively "no signs" or "clear signs" of mastitis were observed. in particular, inclusion of in vivo time points {1}+{6}+{7}+{12} in list  and {3}+{8}+{13} in list  , was supported by the absence or the clear presence, respectively, of clinical signs of acute mastitis such as increased scc count, decreased milk yield, leukopenia, fever, and udder swelling . the absence of clinical signs in time points {1}, {6}, and {7} had been confirmed by real-time pcr of indicators for acute mastitis . the early time points {10} and {14} of the in vitro studies were assigned to the early stage response because minimal or no reaction or cell death was observed, while the later time points {11} and {15} were included in the late stage response because clear reaction or physiological deformation and death of the cells were observed. time point {9} was neither included in the early stage nor in the late stage response because it was the only available time point for the pathogen s. uberis.

overall response to mastitis infection
because we pooled microarrays of different designs, only  <dig>  probes could be analyzed in combination  overall response. of the  <dig> probes identified by pointillist as being significantly altered , a total of  <dig> unique genes were present in the ipa knowledge database . the relative weights assigned by pointillist to each species-specific experiment were  <dig>  for cattle ,  <dig>  for goat , and  <dig>  for sheep . this indicates that the cattle data had greater statistical power than the goat- and sheep-specific data, which were similar in terms of statistical power.

affected canonical pathways
the  <dig> canonical pathways identified by ipa as being most significantly associated to this list of  <dig> genes were protein ubiquitination, acute phase response signaling, lipid antigen presentation by cd <dig>  oncostatin m signaling, and antigen presentation pathway .

the protein ubiquitination pathway has a fundamental role in a myriad of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, antigen presentation, and regulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses  <cit> ). this pathway was present within the  <dig> most significant canonical pathways of the other  <dig> main gene lists , confirming its role in defence against pathogens, including bacteria  <cit> . the acute phase response is a rapid, non-specific inflammatory response that provides protection against microorganisms, and is associated with the expression of several cytokines  <cit> . furthermore, bovine acute phase response has been shown to be activated by lipopolysaccharide   <cit>  and by e. coli  <cit> , possibly through its lps. the lipid antigen presentation by cd <dig> and the antigen presentation pathways are important to the development of innate and adaptive immunity  <cit> . finally, oncostatin m signaling is known to be responsible for the initiation and progression of inflammation and the acute phase response  <cit> . these findings suggest that the alteration of immune response and lipid metabolism are hallmarks of the response to infections causing mastitis.

affected biological functions
 reports the complete lists of affected biological functions for all the sub-groups "diseases and disorders", "physiological system development and function" and "molecular and cellular functions". the five most significant molecular and cellular functions altered during the overall response to mastitis were cell death, cellular movement, cellular growth and proliferation, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, and lipid metabolism. the first three altered functions were among the  <dig> most affected in all  <dig> main responses .

perturbation of the lipid metabolism might affect the lipid antigen presentation by cd <dig> pathway , which consists of a conserved family of mhc-like glycoproteins specialized in capturing lipid and glycolipid antigens for presentation to t lymphocytes  <cit> . a relevant correlation between lipid metabolism and mastitis infection caused by s. uberis in mammary tissues has indeed been reported  <cit> . furthermore, lipid metabolism has been identified as one of the most altered biological functions in cows fed at different energy balance diets  <cit>  and it has been associated with differentially regulated proteins detected in cows infected with e. coli and s. aureus  <cit> . consequently, ipa was used to further dissect the main sub-functions linked to lipid metabolism. metabolism of long chain fatty acids, accumulation of oleic acids, internalization of lipids, and uptake of fatty acids and arachidonic acid were the top  <dig> annotated functions related to lipid metabolism and altered during the overall response to mastitis . the affected biological functions further confirm a relevant role of the lipid metabolism during response to infections causing mastitis.

early stage and late stage responses to mastitis infection
of the  <dig>  probes analyzed by pointillist for the early and late stage responses,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, were significantly altered . of these, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> unique genes, respectively, were present in the ipa knowledge database .

affected canonical pathways
in addition to the protein ubiquitination and polyamine regulation pathways that were common for both combinations, the early stage response was characterized by pathways closely related to metabolic regulation, including hypoxia signaling, pyruvate metabolism, and endoplasmic reticulum  stress . hypoxia inducible factors are known to control innate immunity and gene expression of pro-inflammatory molecules  <cit> , and correlations between er stress, immune response and apoptosis have been reported  <cit> . also, pyruvate accumulation caused by inhibition of lipid metabolism has indeed been shown to prompt hypoxia signaling in mastitis in cattle  <cit> . the significant alterations of these closely linked pathways suggests that stress signals are launched by the host cells as part of the activation of the immune response early during infection, i.e. prior to observation of clear phenotypes related to mastitis.

on the other hand, the late stage response was specifically represented by pathways directly involved in the immune response, i.e. il- <dig> signaling, lxr/rxr activation and il- <dig> signaling . a close relationship between polyamine regulation, in particular the sub-group spermine, and il- <dig> signaling has been reported in macrophages  <cit> . other studies reported an increase of il- <dig> and il- <dig> expression during mastitis infection  <cit> . as persistence or over-prolongation of inflammation is harmful for cells  <cit> , the activation of the il- <dig> signaling might be a beneficial mechanism adopted by the cells during this stage of mastitis infection to limit and terminate the inflammatory response.

affected biological functions
cellular growth and proliferation, cell death and cellular movement were  <dig> of the top  <dig> significant molecular and cellular functions identified by ipa for both time-dependant responses . two protein-related functions  were specific for the early stage response, while cellular functions  were specific for the late stage response .

lipid metabolism was significantly altered during both early  and late stage  infections, although it was not among the five most significant. the altered lxr/rxr signaling pathway  is known to be implicated in the regulation of the lipid metabolism  <cit> . since lipid metabolism was among the top  <dig> affected molecular and cellular functions in the overall analysis , the main altered sub-functions of the lipid metabolism were identified by ipa. hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol phosphate, phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -diphosphate, and phosphtidylinositol 5-phosphate, as well as metabolism of fatty acid and lipids were the most significant affected sub-functions for the early stage response . for the late stage response on the other hand, quantity of fatty acid, oleic acid, and lipid, as well as synthesis of lipid and cholesterol were the identified top affected sub-functions. these results seem to suggest that whilst during the early stage response there might be a "general" deregulation of the lipid metabolism, during the late stage response the cells might react to the infection by synthesizing, taking up, or incorporating lipids and fatty acids.

relevance of the xbp <dig> gene during the early stage of infection
the lists of affected genes during the early and late stage responses were analyzed with the ipa feature "pathway building", which shows the main relationships and connections among affected genes belonging to altered canonical pathways. the two genes x-box binding protein  <dig>  and sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor  <dig>  are of particular relevance in early and late stage infection, respectively. both belong to canonical pathways that were among the  <dig> most affected   and, in agreement with their function as transcription factors, they were directly linked to the highest number of other affected genes .

xbp <dig> and the additional transcription factors atf <dig>  as well as the molecular chaperone dnajb <dig> and the heat-shock protein gene hspa <dig>  which are key molecules of er stress, one of the  <dig> most significantly affected pathways , were altered during the early stage response. comparable results have been reported in other studies in dairy cows where expressions of atf <dig>  xbp <dig>  and dnajb <dig> were altered in er stress generated by a negative energy balance  <cit> . hence, xbp <dig> might have a central role in launching stress signals in preparation for an adequate immune response during the early stage of mastitis infection, as it is also involved in cytokine production in different cell types, including macrophages  <cit> . this gene directly regulates the expression of the affected genes copz <dig>  ddost, kdelr <dig>  kdelr <dig>  rpn <dig>  sec23b, sec24d, sec61a <dig>  srpr, as well as genes of the proteasome and the mhc class ii complex . indirectly, xbp <dig> is also linked to many more affected genes . in line with our results, alteration of several genes that directly interact with xbp <dig>  have also been reported in fibroblasts over-expressing xbp <dig>  <cit> .

relevance of the srebf <dig> gene during the late stage of infection
in the late stage response, srebf <dig> directly interacts with several affected lipogenic genes, i.e. traf3ip <dig>  cd <dig>  scd, sod <dig>  idh <dig>  thrb, retn, pmvk, dbi, ucp <dig>  hbs <dig>  sc4mol, and cyp27a <dig> . among these, expressions of traf3ip <dig>  cd <dig>  and scd were also reported to be altered during infection of cattle mammary tissues with s. uberis  <cit> . srebf <dig> is a component of the lxr/rxr pathway, one of the  <dig> most affected pathways, confirming the relationship between lxr/rxr signalling and lipid metabolism. this relationship might explain the observed depression of milk fat synthesis during mastitis infection in ruminants.

early and late stage specific responses
in order to better understand the differences between the two different time-related responses, the  early stage and the  late stage responses were subjected to ipa analysis taking into account only the subset of affected genes differentiating the two lists. while  <dig> genes belonged to list  and not list  ,  <dig> genes belonged to list  and not list   .

affected canonical pathways
the results of the canonical pathway analysis confirmed that during early specific response there is intensification of cell metabolism , the protein ubiquitination pathway, as well as the stress signal pathways, e.g. hypoxia in the cardiovascular system and ataxia telangiectasia mutated  signaling . during the late specific, the top affected pathways  indicated an intense activity of the immune response, with the possible involvement of macrophages.

affected biological functions
none of the top  <dig> molecular and cellular functions were in common between the two time-specific gene lists  and  . similarly to the previous analysis of gene list  early stage response and  late stage response, the early specific response genes showed molecular and cellular functions related to metabolism , biochemistry and protein synthesis , while the late specific response were mainly involved in cellular functions , as well as cell morphology.

cattle-specific response to mastitis infection
pointillist identified  <dig> out of  <dig>  common probes that were significantly altered  in the cattle-specific response to mastitis. the weights given by pointillist to experiments 1a, 1b, 1c,  <dig>  and  <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively, showing that the in vitro data set had a lower statistical power than the other data sets. of the  <dig> probes, a total of  <dig> unique genes were present in the ipa knowledge database.

affected canonical pathways
besides polyamine regulation and protein ubiquitination, the top canonical pathways characterizing the cattle-specific response were acute phase response, lipid antigen presentation by cd <dig> , two highly relevant pathways for immune response, and the inositol metabolism , which is involved in t-cell, b-cell, and neutrophil development and function  <cit> . these results indicate a link between mastitis and immune response involving t and b cells.

affected biological functions
in accordance with the top canonical pathway analysis, the altered molecular and cellular functions identified by ipa  reflected an intensification of the immune response during cattle-specific response to mastitis infection .

alteration of the expression of genes involved in immune response, antigen presentation, apoptosis, and acute phase response have been also reported in a similar study  <cit> .

lipid metabolism was also significantly affected , although it was not included among the five most significant. sub-functions of lipid metabolism that were altered during the cattle-specific response included uptake of arachidonic acid, metabolism of long chain fatty acid, internalization of cholesterol, transport and quantity of fatty acid . these findings further underline that lipid metabolism is tightly linked to immune response and that lipid antigen presentation might represent an interesting candidate pathway for future work to gain new insights into the host-pathogen interplay in mastitis.

comparison of the host expression profiles in the different experiments and time points
next, we compared the different cattle microarray datasets, focusing on the impact of the use of different infective agents  and the patterns of gene response that they caused in the host.

when clustering the expression profiles of the cattle-specific response time points  the first clustering step is primarily based on experiment number  . it is not unexpected that expression profiles of different time points of the same microarray experiment cluster together. the final clustering steps indicated a pathogen-specific pattern as all s. aureus time points  clustered together, separately from the e. coli time points. no inter-laboratory or inter-array clustering was observed. for instance, the e. coli data  did not cluster with the data from the other experiments  performed in the same institution . this provides reassurance that the data were not significantly biased towards the experimental conditions used.

comparison of the strength of the host response to the  <dig> different pathogens
we also compared the magnitude of fold change differences in gene expression in the cattle host caused by e. coli, s. aureus, or s. uberis infections with the masigpro package  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows that, in general, the e. coli infection caused a stronger response in the host than the s. aureus and s. uberis infections. high fold change differences were induced by e. coli, especially at  <dig> h post infection , and to a lesser extent by s. uberis between  <dig> and  <dig> h post infection .

although this finding might be related to the specific experimental conditions used in the different experiments, it reflects previous observations that e. coli infection is very acute at  <dig> h, but not yet at  <dig> h pi  <cit> , and that it is very acute compared to other pathogens  <cit> . furthermore, the results suggest that s. aureus, but not e. coli, frequently causes subclinical, chronic infections of the mammary gland and hence elicits an inadequate mammary immune response  <cit> .

comparison between meta-analysis of  cattle-specific response and individual experiments
to better quantify the additional power of the proposed meta-analysis approach, we compared the list of  <dig> affected genes identified with the meta-analysis of  cattle-specific response with the lists of affected genes  in individual experiments . the results showed that  <dig> affected genes were in common between the three lists, while  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were specific for  cattle-specific response, experiment 1a time point {3}, and experiment  <dig> time point {9}, respectively .

next, applying ipa on the lists of affected genes, we identified the  <dig> most affected canonical pathways and molecular and cellular functions of the individual experiments. the canonical pathways protein ubiquitination , ephrin receptor signaling , regulation of actin-based motility by rho , actin cytoskeleton signaling , and germ cell-sertoli cell junction signaling , as well as the molecular and cellular functions cell death, cellular growth and proliferation, cell signaling, cellular movement, and lipid metabolism were the most affected within the  <dig> affected genes of experiment 1a time point {3}. canonical pathways and molecular and cellular functions in common with the five most affected identified by meta-analysis of the  cattle-specific response  included polyamine regulation, as well as cell death, cellular growth and proliferation, and cellular movement, respectively.

the ipa canonical pathways icos-icosl signaling in t helper cells , activation of irf by cytosolic pattern recognition receptors , dendritic cell maturation , production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species in macrophages , and communication between innate and adaptive immune cells , as well as the molecular and cellular functions cellular growth and proliferation, cell death, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, cellular function and maintenance, and gene expression were the most affected within the  <dig> genes of experiment  <dig> time point {9}. none of the canonical pathways were in common with the most affected of the meta-analysis of the  cattle-specific response; whereas cell death, cellular growth and proliferation, and cell-to-cell signaling and interaction were common molecular and cellular functions.

the retrieval of common molecular and cellular functions and/or pathways by the two approaches  confirms the statistical power of the meta-analysis and its complementary to the fdr correction with regard to the pruning of false positives. furthermore, the identification of novel affected biological functions and pathways further shows the added value of the meta-analysis approach.

comparison between e. coli and s. aureus infections
to better evaluate the pathogen-specific characteristics, we further compared the responses to infection with e. coli  or s. aureus  in the cattle host. we excluded the s. uberis data  as we had only one single time point {9} available.

we used the pamr package to identify the genes which were most dissimilar in terms of their activation in response to the two different pathogens. of the retained  <dig> most dissimilar genes,  <dig> were down-regulated by e. coli infection and up-regulated by s. aureus infection, while  <dig> showed the opposite trend .

list of the  <dig> most dissimilarly regulated genes identified with the pamr software, showing opposite fold change responses during e. coli and s. aureus infections in cattle in vivo . for each gene, the pamr shrunken centroid values  for the e. coli and the s. aureus experiments are reported. twenty-one of the listed genes were up-regulated during infection with s. aureus, while  <dig> were up-regulated during e. coli infection.

this list of dissimilar genes was further analyzed with ipa to identify altered biological functions and networks. the  <dig> most significant molecular and cellular functions identified were cellular development, cellular growth and proliferation, cellular function and maintenance, cell death, and lipid metabolism . both cell death and lipid metabolism were previously found to be among the  <dig> most significant molecular functions altered in proteins of cows infected with either e. coli or s. aureus  <cit> . the ipa network called "antigen presentation, inflammatory response, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction" was the most significantly represented by the list of dissimilar genes. of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> are included in this network: btg <dig>  cd <dig>  csda, fkbp <dig>  igfbp <dig>  glul, hspd <dig>  lcn <dig>  and phb. igfbp <dig> and cd <dig> were up-regulated after e. coli infection and down-regulated after s. aureus infection, while the others showed the opposite trend .

pathogen-dependent differences in the time kinetics of induced receptors and defense molecules , as measured by real-time pcr, have been reported between e. coli and s. aureus  <cit> . although none of these defense genes were in the list of the  <dig> most dissimilar genes, our results were in general agreement with these findings as we found that the majority of genes with opposed regulation were associated with immune response and mainly belonged to the antigen presentation, inflammatory response, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction network.

these findings suggest that, at least at the transcriptomic level, these two pathogens cause distinct forms of mastitis infection by the differential modulation of genes belonging to similar molecular pathways and biological functions.

comparisons of the  <dig> lists  of affected genes
in order to have an accurate global view of the lists of genes belonging to the  <dig> different responses to mastitis infection , we drew a venn diagram  that provides a graphical representation of the number of affected genes, as inferred by pointillist, that are in common, exclusive, or at the various intersections between  <dig> or  <dig> lists. the corresponding gene lists with the gene names can be found in . interestingly, we identified a family of antimicrobial genes  that were affected in all but the early stage response. this finding was in line with a recent study in cattle, where microarray analysis using affymetrix gene chip revealed that these genes were differentially expressed after  <dig> h, but not  <dig> h, of e. coli infection  <cit> .

however, the vast majority of the listed genes have not previously been reported to be implicated in the mastitis infection process. of particular interest are those genes, a total of  <dig> , in common between the  <dig>  responses to mastitis , providing possible clues for valuable candidate biomarkers.

altered pathways and biological functions related to the  <dig> genes in common for all  <dig> responses
the  <dig> most affected canonical pathways underlying these  <dig> common genes  were polyamine regulation, protein ubiquitination, and molecular mechanisms of cancer. the pathways lxr/rxr activation and factors promoting cardiogenesis in vertebrates only approached statistical significance . altered molecular and cellular functions identified by ipa  showed general cell related functions  as well as, once again, lipid metabolism.

CONCLUSIONS
to the best of our knowledge this study is the first that statistically combines heterogeneous microarray data realized with different ruminant host species and infected with different mastitis-causing pathogens. the results reinforced previous findings but also revealed several novel themes, including the involvement of genes and pathways that were not identified in individual studies.

among the  <dig> most significant molecular and cellular functions common to all  <dig> gene lists of differential responses to mastitis were cell death, cellular movement, and cellular growth and proliferation, i.e. functions which are intrinsic to general disease response. this indicates that the described procedure of meta-analysis could cope well with the high heterogeneity of the biological systems and the different microarrays used. indeed, this was confirmed by the analysis of the reduced list of  <dig> genes in common to all lists that also identified cellular growth and proliferation and cellular movement as being altered.

the results show that protein ubiquitination and polyamine regulation, two pathways involved in immune response modulation and represented by different individual genes, possibly represent a common biological manifestation during mastitis infection in different biological systems. furthermore, strong complementarities between the early stage and late stages of infection was found, showing a prominence of metabolic and stress signals in the early stage and of the immune response related to the lipid metabolism in the late stage, both mechanisms were apparently triggered by a small number of genes, including xbp <dig> and srebf <dig>  the cattle-specific response showed an intensification of the immune and inflammatory responses through t lymphocyte involvement. furthermore, we found several strands of evidence suggesting a correlation between immune response and lipid metabolism as a hallmark of the response of ruminants against mastitis infection.

overall, the reported meta-analysis approach successfully combined heterogeneous data sets and extracted information of value from individual microarray studies of limited size and statistical power. as such, it provides a global transcriptomic reference which could be useful for the development of novel therapeutics and vaccines for mastitis in ruminants. furthermore, these data and methodology provide an interesting proof of principle for future studies combining information from diverse sources.
