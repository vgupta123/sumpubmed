BACKGROUND
cytoplasmic male sterility , as a maternally inherited trait that prevents the production of functional pollen, is widely used in hybrid breeding and currently, is observed in >  <dig> plant species. cms has been associated with expression of mitochondrial novel open reading frames  that arise from rearrangements of mitochondrial genomes. such orfs are often located adjacent to genes encoding components of the atpase complex, and co-transcribed with these genes  <cit> . although numerous attempts have been tried to isolate genes involved in cms, regulatory network of cms occurrence is still largely unknown in plants. commonly, mitochondrial mutations lead to embryo lethality in plants owing to the essential nature of mitochondrial functions in energy metabolism. cms mutations are an exception and these are naturally occurring mitochondrial genomic variants that condition nuclear-cytoplasmic incompatibility to produce a male sterility phenotype  <cit> .

in plant cells, the mitochondrion and chloroplast are two semi-autonomous organelles that encode limited genetic information, with the majority being derived and imported from the nucleus. the inter-organellar communication between mitochondria and the nucleus is extensive, multifaceted and highly regulated. the predominant role of the nucleus in the cell has directed attention in recent years to studies of signaling from the nucleus to organelles , focusing mainly on pentatricopeptide repeat proteins that regulate rna editing in mitochondria/chloroplasts and male fertility restorer genes in cms  <cit> . however, organelles are also engaged in regulation of organelle-to-nucleus signaling  that fine-tunes nuclear gene expression, and influences stress responses, growth and development  <cit> . mitochondrial retrograde regulation  of nuclear gene expression was first defined in yeast  <cit>  and was well described in yeast and mammals  <cit> . the rtg  pathway in yeast revealed the nuclear target gene cit <dig> and key proteins of signal transduction   <cit> . however, mitochondrial retrograde regulation of nuclear gene expression is poorly understood in plants. the few reviews available have presumed that there are similar mitochondrial retrograde regulation pathways to yeasts and mammals  <cit> . in plant, evidence of plastid retrograde regulation is relatively well described, in which the gun <dig> gene integrates multiple signals in the plastid and leads to abi4-mediated repression of nuclear gene expression  <cit> . more recently, abi4-mediated repression of nuclear gene expression was also identified to be involved in a mitochondrial retrograde regulation pathway  <cit> .

micrornas  are endogenous non-coding rnas of ~  <dig> nucleotides  in length in plants, which guide post-transcriptional gene regulation mainly via mrna cleavage. in arabidopsis, mirnas have been shown to play key roles in various biological processes, including developmental regulation, hormone response and stress adaptation  <cit> . to date, hundreds of small rnas  have been isolated by direct cloning or deep sequencing in plants  <cit> . microrna targets can be identified by computational prediction, based on sequence complementarity between mirnas and the target mrna or sequence conservation among different species  <cit> . they have been implicated in degradation of their mrna targets into fragments with a monophosphate at the end. therefore, isolation and sequencing of target mrna degradation fragments can be used to validate mirna targets. recently, degradome sequencing, which combines high-throughput deep sequencing with bioinformatics analysis, has been successfully implemented to identify mirna targets in arabidopsis <cit> . this method has been used to confirm predicted mirna targets, allowing large-scale discovery of mirna targets in plants  <cit> .

in the present study, we identified mirnas and their targets using high-throughput sequencing methods during reproductive development of cms and its mf lines of b. juncea. the differential expression of mirnas observed between cms and mf lines suggested that biogenesis of mirnas could be influenced in the cms.

RESULTS
srna populations in reproductive development of b. juncea
to study the possible gene differences involved in the abortion of pollen development and the abnormal development of floral organ possibly caused by srna in cms b. juncea, the srna libraries of reproductive development from cms and mf b. juncea were constructed with rnas from all floral buds of one intact inflorescence. deep sequencing generated a total number of  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> from mf and  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> from cms raw reads . after removal of corrupted adapter sequences, reads with length <  <dig> and >  <dig> nt and junk reads, there were  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> and  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> mappable reads obtained for mf and cms libraries, respectively . the majority of srnas were 21– <dig> nt for both libraries. this is within the typical size range for dicer-derived products, in which 21-nt srnas were most abundant followed by  <dig> nt as the second largest percentage representing the class of endogenous srna families . we further compared the unique mirnas between mf and cms. there were  <dig> and  <dig> 21–24-nt unique mirnas in mf and cms, respectively, of which there were  <dig> and  <dig> unique 21-nt mirnas .


identification of known mirnas in reproductive development from b. juncea
to identify the mirnas from the reproductive development of b. juncea, srna sequences identified from b. juncea by deep sequencing were compared with the currently known mature plant mirnas. in mirbase  <dig> , there are  <dig> arabidopsis pre-micrornas  reported that correspond to  <dig> mature mirnas. in the present study,  <dig> pre-mirnas corresponding to  <dig> mirnas were detected, as well as  <dig> new mature 5′- or 3′-mirnas corresponding to arabidopsis pre-mirnas detected for the first time . there were four novel pre-mirnas corresponding to five mature mirnas originating from other species rather arabidopsis. among the five mature mirnas, three new mature 5’- or 3’-mirnas were detected in b. juncea for the first time. the other two pre-mirnas corresponding to two mature mirnas came from two other plant species  and could be mapped to the arabidopsis genome . five novel mirnas originating from seven pre-mirnas could not be mapped to the arabidopsis genome; these were mapped to other plant species genomes and the extended sequences at the mapped positions of the genome potentially form hairpins . another  <dig> novel mirnas identified to originate from pre-mirnas, that could not be mapped to the arabidopsis genome but were mapped to other plant genomes, failed in hairpin structure prediction for extended sequences at the mapped positions . there were also  <dig> novel mirnas conserved in other plant species, but not found in the arabidopsis genome .

identification of new candidate mirnas in reproductive development of b. juncea
to identify new mirnas, we removed all reads with low abundance from sequence data, and the data were then used to query the mrna , non-coding rna sequences at the database  and the repeat-repbase . the consensus surrounding the genomic regions of each mirna was retrieved and secondary structure was predicted. all genomic loci-generating srnas that can be folded into a secondary structure were considered as mirna candidates. in total,  <dig> pre-mirnas corresponding to  <dig> unique mature mirnas were first identified in the present study, and these candidate mirnas originated from predicted rna hairpins . the secondary hairpin structures of the representative mirnas are shown in figure  <dig> and all secondary hairpin structures of candidate mirnas are listed in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  interestingly, some new candidate mirnas were organelle-derived non-coding srnas: mirnas pc-5p- <dig>  pc-3p- <dig>  pc-3p- <dig>  pc-5p- <dig>  pc-3p- <dig>  pc-3p- <dig>  pc-5p- <dig>  pc-5p- <dig> and pc-3p- <dig> are derived from chloroplasts, and pc-5p- <dig>  pc-3p- <dig>  pc-3p- <dig> and pc-5p- <dig> from mitochondria. strikingly, several pre-mirna and mature sequences of new candidate mirnas were the same, but were located by alignment to nuclear and mitochondrial genomes respectively, including pre-mirna22/pre-mirna <dig>  pre-mirna24/pre-mirna <dig>  pre-mirna73/pre-mirna <dig> and pre-mirna75/pre-mirna <dig> . finally,  <dig> mirnas, including known and new candidates, were identified in reproductive development of mf and cms b. juncea .


differential expression of mirnas during reproductive development of mf and cms b. juncea
mirnas in mf and cms were used for differential expression analysis with ideg <dig> . the selection methods of differential expression were audic and claverie, fisher’s exact test and chi-squared 2 ×  <dig>  with the selection threshold of  <dig>  . finally,  <dig> mirnas were differentially expressed between mf and cms: among these,  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were down- and up-regulated, respectively, according to sequencing reads . the expressions of  <dig> selected mirnas were tested using quantitative real-time rt-pcr  analysis, which further validated the differential expression data obtained from sequencing on the whole . the expression patterns of  <dig> of  <dig> mirnas were consistent with the sequencing reads. the expressions of ath-mir396b and ath-mir159_r- <dig> showed no significant differences between cms and mf, however, the expressions of these two mirnas were down-regulated in cms . to determine whether the expressions of mirnas could be regulated by mitochondrial function, we studied the expressions of  <dig> selected mirnas in mf, cms and when treated with a mitochondrial-specific inhibitor . for the down-regulated mirnas in cms, ath-mir393a and ath-mir156e-p <dig>  their expressions were also decreased in mf treated with oligomycin, and relatively more reduced in cms treated with oligomycin. for up-regulated mirnas in cms, the expression of ath-mir159a was also increased in mf treated with oligomycin, and relatively more increased in cms treated with oligomycin .


target genes of mirnas by degradome sequencing and analysis
to date, limited targets for mirnas have been identified in plants. here, we performed a genome-wide sequencing of mirna-cleaved mrna and cleveland analysis based on recently developed high-throughput degradome sequencing technology  <cit> . the targets for all mirnas are listed . the abundance of transcripts was plotted for each transcript and the sliced-target transcripts were grouped into five categories according to the relative abundance of tags at the target sites . category ‘0’ is defined as >  <dig> raw read at the position, with abundance at a position equal to the maximum on the transcript, and with only one maximum on the transcript. category ‘1’ is described as >  <dig> raw read at the position, with abundance at the position equal to the maximum on the transcript, and more than one maximum position on the transcript. category ‘2’ includes >  <dig> raw read at the position, and abundance at the position less than the maximum but higher than the median for the transcript. category ‘3’ comprised the transcripts with >  <dig> raw read at the position, and abundance at the position equal to or less than the median for the transcript; and category ‘4’ showed only one raw read at the position. the representative mirnas and corresponding targets included all five categories, in which a red line indicates the cleavage site of each transcript . in total we identified  <dig> and  <dig> targets in reproductive development for mf and cms b. juncea, respectively , and  <dig> high assuring targets with different read abundance of cleavage . these targets included auxin response factor, nac  domain transcription factor, gras family transcription factor, myb transcription factor, squamosa promoter binding protein, ap2-type transcription factor, homeobox/homeobox-leucine zipper family and tcp family transcription factor, which have essential roles in gene regulation .


we also identified the targets of new candidate mirnas by degradome sequencing and analysis. in total,  <dig> new candidate mirnas were shown to target  <dig> transcripts . although some new candidate mirnas were accumulated to a very low level according to sequencing reads, their targets were still identified by degradome sequencing and analysis. the abundance of transcripts was also plotted on each transcript and these sliced-target transcripts were grouped into five categories according to the relative abundance of the tags at the target sites for the new candidate mirnas . the new candidate mirnas targeted different genes with a wide variety of predicted functions. among the identified targets of new candidate mirnas, pc-3p- <dig> targeted the gtp-binding elongation factor tu family of proteins; and pc-3p- <dig> targeted several genes including myb domain protein  <dig>  eukaryotic translation initiation factor family protein and squamosa promoter binding protein-like gene, suggesting its multiple regulating functions . in addition, several new candidate mirnas targeted some genes of unknown function.


expression of mirna395a and aps <dig> gene in mf and cms b. juncea
from degradome sequencing and analysis, atp sulfurylase  <dig>  gene was identified to be the target gene of mirna <dig>  to confirm the causality of the mirna expression patterns and its target gene, we studied the expression of aps <dig> in mf and cms. aps <dig> expression level was higher in cms than mf because of lower expression of mirna395a and negative regulation of aps <dig> expression in cms . to determine whether the expression of mir395a and aps <dig> could be regulated by mitochondrial function, we studied the expression of mir395a and aps <dig> in mf and cms, and treated with oligomycin. when we treated mf and cms with oligomycin, aps <dig> expression was increased, and its induction was greater in cms .


discussion
using high-throughput deep sequencing technology, we pyrosequenced srna populations from reproductive development of b. juncea at the genome-wide level. based on the analysis from the newly updated mirbase  <dig> , we identified a much wider range of srnas with 15– <dig> nt in length  than the range of srnas with 16– <dig> nt in length in previous publications. several species in plants, including arabidopsis, oryzasativa, solanum lycopersicum and medicago truncatula, had been shown to contain substantially more 24-nt than 21-nt srnas . additionally, more 21-nt than 24-nt srnas were reported in vitis vinifera and m. truncatula treated with hg+ <cit> . here, we observed a high level of 21-nt compared with 24-nt srna in reproductive development of b. juncea . brassica juncea is an allopolyploid species that originated from hybridization between ancestral parents of b. rapa and b. nigra. srnas serve as a genetic buffer against genomic shock in interspecific hybrids and allopolyploid arabidopsis, in which allopolyploid species usually face reorganization of homological gene regions  <cit> . in our investigations, we found almost no recombination for the chromosome from b. rapa and b. nigra in allopolyploid b. juncea . the unusual srnas might play a role in regulating homologous gene expression.

identification of mirnas has previously been reported in model plants, including in developing pollen of o. sativa <cit>  and mature pollen of arabidopsis <cit>  by using deep sequencing or mirna arrays. the present study is the first to report comprehensive identification of mirnas and their targets using high-throughput sequencing in reproductive development of b. juncea. because whole genome sequences of b. juncea are not yet available, we mainly referred to genome information of arabidopsis  to analyze the mirnas. the majority of these known mirnas in arabidopsis and other species were detected and had relatively high expression abundance in b. juncea . most known mirnas had the canonical  <dig> nt length, suggesting dcl <dig> cleavage products, with few variations observed in b. juncea. we also identified many b. juncea-specific mirnas with named mirna* strands in formed mirbase, being an important prerequisite for new mirna identification. additionally,  <dig> new candidate mature mirnas were sequenced in reproductive development of b. juncea, of which most represented a new class of mirnas of 23– <dig> nt in length, termed long mirnas . these long mirnas were likely to be dependent on dcl <dig> and the hierarchical action of other dcls according to the evolution of mirnas  <cit> . interestingly, some new candidate mirnas were observed to be organelle-derived mirnas , which suggested that these mirnas were derived by alternative biogenesis pathways, not via dicer proteins. indeed, srnas can be generated from organelles including chloroplasts and mitochondria in animals, plants, fungi and humans  <cit> . new candidate mirnas are considered to be young mirnas that have evolved recently, and are often expressed at a lower level than conserved mirnas, as reported from arabidopsis and triticum <cit> . this observation was also true for most of the new mirnas identified from b. juncea . moreover, the mirnas with the same sequence of pre-mirna and mature mirna for each group   are thought to be associated with nuclear-mitochondrial co-evolution or communications between nucleus and mitochondria.

mirnas related to reproductive development, especially floral organ development, have been well studied in arabidopsis; however, identification of the targets regulated by mirnas related to reproductive development are largely unknown. for example, among these identified mirnas and their corresponding targets, mirbl and mirfis  exert homeotic control over petunia hybrida and antirrhinum majus floral organ identity  <cit> . mir <dig> likely acts in cell-fate specification as a translational repressor of apetala <dig> gene in arabidopsis flower development  <cit> . mir <dig> that targets myb <dig> and myb <dig> is essential for normal anther development in arabidopsis <cit> . arabidopsis mir <dig> controls patterns of arf <dig> and arf <dig> gene expression, and regulates both female and male reproduction  <cit> . in previous cases, targets of mirnas were identified by computational prediction in silico, and then using modified 5′-race-pcr to confirm the expression of target genes in pollen development  <cit> . the confirmation procedures were convincing but not high-throughput. degradome sequencing has shown to be powerful in identifying target genes of mirnas with greater throughput  <cit> . the present study is the first to report comprehensive identification of mirna targets associated with reproductive development using high-throughput sequencing and degradome analysis in reproductive development of b. juncea. of the identified targets of mirnas, some were previously shown to be involved in floral organ or pollen development, e.g. myb65/myb <dig>  <cit> , arf6/afr <dig>  <cit> , ap <dig>  <cit>  and squamosa promototer binding protein-like  <cit> . some of them have not been shown to be associated with reproductive development as mirna targets, such as homeobox-leucine zipper family protein, other genes in the promototer binding protein-like family and the gras family transcription factor genes. we identified  <dig> targets for new candidate mirnas in reproductive development of b. juncea . the newly identified mirnas and their targets might offer useful information in potential future studies on mirnas and their targets involved in reproductive development, which should be further investigated. it is noteworthy that pc-3p- <dig> targeted the gtp-binding elongation factor tu family of proteins, which were likely associated with pollen development. the most obvious difference between the targets of conserved and new mirnas was that most new mirna targets belonged to categories ‘3’ and ‘4’ , where cleavage abundance was below the median on target transcripts. the finding that new mirna targets mainly fall into categories ‘3’ and ‘4’ may suggest that these new mirnas are young and not fully stabilized evolutionarily.

the majority of mature mirnas are generated from the processes of pri-mirna by a dicer-like enzyme and loaded into a ribo-nucleo-protein complex consisting of an argonaute  in various biological processes, including developmental regulation, hormone response and stress adaptation. a link between mirna biogenesis and stresses has been well studied and documented in many cases  <cit> . in the case of mir <dig>  down-regulated by multiple stresses, reduced expression of mir <dig> in transgenic lines causes enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress  <cit> . intriguingly, sucrose can up-regulate mir <dig> expression, suggesting a possible link between cellular energy status and mirna biogenesis  <cit> . such a link is further supported by a recent study, in which mirna biogenesis could be triggered by inhibition of mitochondrial respiration  <cit> . here, we employed deep sequencing to identify mirnas that might be related to abnormal reproductive development in cms b. juncea. we detected differential expression of many mirnas between cms and mf. interestingly, the expression patterns of these mirnas could be mimicked by artificial inhibition of f1f0-atpase activity after treatment with oligomycin, a specific inhibitor of the atpase complex. our studies suggest that mirna biogenesis can be regulated by mitochondrial function inhibition, which enlarges the scope of induction of mirna biogenesis. at least three kinds of mitochondrial retrograde regulation pathways and mechanisms are seen in yeast  <cit> . the general process of mrr is conserved among yeast, mammals and plants, among which the mechanisms of signal molecules and signal transduction pathways are probably quite diverse  <cit> . in arabidopsis, using the promoter of aox1a gene as a mitochondrial marker, candidate mitochondrial retrograde regulation mutants were identified in response to distinct mitochondrial perturbations of the tricarboxylic acid cycle or mitochondrial electron transport chain  <cit> . the transcription factor abi <dig>  which has been identified in chloroplast retrograde regulation, also plays an important role in mediating mitochondrial retrograde regulation signals to induce the expression of aox1a in arabidopsis. comparative studies between cms and mf lines have shown that some nuclear candidate genes and transcription factor genes are involved in retrograde regulation signaling in plants  <cit> . with deep sequencing and degradome analysis in the present study, we observed that nuclear-cytoplasmic incompatibility can regulate mirna biogenesis and its corresponding targeted gene expression. of these tf genes, the tcp family was reported to be involved in nuclear–mitochondrial communication  <cit> , and homeobox domain protein  that interacts with abi <dig> plays an important role in chloroplast retrograde regulation in arabidopsis <cit> . in the present study, we observed the different mirnas biogenesis in cms, although we could not completely conclude that the difference on srna is cause or effect for cms occurrence or whether mirnas are involved in the retrograde regulation or not. however, we can propose that this difference may partially answer for how mitochondrial and nuclear transcriptome interacts.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we employed high-throughput sequencing approaches to identify known and new candidate mirnas and their targets associated with reproductive development in b. juncea. comparison of the expression of mirnas between cms and mf lines led to a proposal of that microrna might participate the regulatory network of cms by tuning fork in genes expressions in cms b. juncea .
