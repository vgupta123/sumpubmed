BACKGROUND
heterotrimeric g proteins are composed of gα subunits and gβγ dimers, and can be activated by g-protein-coupled receptors . upon binding of an agonist, the receptor changes its conformation, and acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor . by inducing the exchange of guanine diphosphate  for guanine triphosphate  in the gα subunit, the g protein becomes active  <cit> . gβγ interacts with gα through two interfaces: the switch region and the region formed by the n terminus of the gα subunit. binding of gtp upon receptor activation disrupts the switch interface, which is thought to trigger the dissociation of gβγ from gα  <cit> . the family of gα subunits consists of four classes; the subunits gαq, gα <dig>  gα <dig> and gα <dig> belong to the gq class. the principal target of the gq class is phospholipase cβ  <cit> . recently, rhogef proteins such as leukemia-associated rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor  and p63rhogef have been shown to directly interact with and to be regulated by gαq, suggesting that they can link gαq-coupled receptors to the activation of the small g protein rhoa  <cit> .

studying gαq is important, because this protein is implicated in the development of myocardial hypertrophy after mechanical stress of the heart  <cit> . because this is one of the triggers of cardiac failure, a leading cause of death in the western world, drugs to inhibit gαq are much in demand  <cit> . proteins belonging to the gq class are also involved in the modulation of synaptic transmission  <cit> , cell growth, platelet aggregation  <cit> , glucose secretion, actin cytoskeletal rearrangements, hematopoietic cell differentiation, leukocyte activation and contraction of smooth muscle, emphasizing their importance in human physiology  <cit> .

recently, several fluorescence resonance energy transfer  sensors have been developed to monitor the activation state of specific heterotrimeric g proteins in living cells upon gpcr activation  <cit> . in this paper, we report on the development of a highly sensitive sensor based on functional mturquoise-tagged gαq and yellow fluorescent protein -tagged gγ <dig>  which allows for monitoring of the location and g protein activation state of gq in living cells and of the kinetics of the process. in addition, we describe the effects of ligand-dependent and ligand-independent stimulation of endogenous and overexpressed receptors, while concurrently monitoring the influence of effectors on the behaviour of the sensor. we opted for dual emission ratiometric fret measurements supplemented with fret-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy  measurements to monitor the kinetics of gq activation and fret efficiencies, respectively.

RESULTS
construction of a gq fret sensor
to further our understanding of the kinetics of gq signalling in living cells, we prepared visible fluorescent protein -tagged human gαq subunits. because neither n- nor c-terminal fusions of gαs to vfp retained functionality  <cit> , we opted for insertion of the fluorescent protein. the vfp insertion site was based on a gαq tagged with hemagglutinin  in the α-helical domain  and on green fluorescent protein tagged gαq , as described previously  <cit> . monomeric  yfp  was inserted into the αb-αc loop of the gαq subunit . upon transient expression, the protein was found at the plasma membrane, as judged from the fluorescence pattern seen in hela cells . fluorescence was also, to variable extents, detected in the cytoplasm and occasionally in the nucleus. in various other cell lines , n1e- <dig> neuroblastoma and hek293) a similar pattern was seen . the localization pattern of gαq-gfp has been thoroughly described by berlot and colleagues  <cit> , and is comparable with the gαq-myfp variant reported here.

fret, which is a distance- and conformation-dependent phenomenon, is very useful for the study of dynamic protein interactions in living cells  <cit> . to measure fret, various techniques can be used. to investigate the kinetics of the interaction between gαq and the gβγ dimer, fret ratio imaging with a cyan fluorescent protein -yfp pair was the method chosen. ratiometric imaging is an intensity-based technique to analyze fret, which involves measurement of the ratio between donor and acceptor fluorescence intensity after induction of signal transduction  <cit> . recently, we reported a novel bright cfp variant, monomeric turquoise , which has excellent properties for use in fret imaging. this fluorescent protein is a monomeric cfp variant that is twice as bright as enhanced cfp, is more photostable, displays an improved signal:noise ratio for ratiometric fret measurements, has a long fluorescent lifetime, and decays mono-exponentially  <cit> . therefore, we replaced the myfp with mtq in the gαq-myfp construct to use it as a donor in fret studies.

since mtq is inserted and the n and c termini of mtq are on the same side of the β-barrel, we reasoned that a c-terminal deletion of six amino acids  would effectively bend the mtq moiety in gαq, thereby forcing the mtq fluorophore  in another orientation. this could have a profound effect on the fret efficiency . importantly, this variant was also found at the plasma membrane in hela cells, similar to gαq-myfp .

we chose to tag the n terminus of gγ <dig> with yfp, to effectively label the gβγ dimer with an acceptor, as this fusion has previously been shown to retain functionality  <cit> .

functionality of the gq sensor
the functionality of the fluorescent gαq proteins  was tested in a mouse embryonic fibroblast  cell line prepared from gαq/11-deficient mice  <cit> . this cell line  and a mef cell line prepared from wild-type mice express the bradykinin  type  <dig> receptor that couples to gαq  <cit> . as expected, addition of bk  led to an increase in cytosolic calcium in the wild-type mef cell line , but not in the mefq/11-/- cell line . expression of wild-type gαq , gαq-myfp  or gαq-mtqΔ <dig>  in mefq/11-/- cells caused an increase in cytosolic calcium upon addition of bk. these results indicate that gαq-myfp and gαq- mtqΔ <dig> can substitute for the wild-type gαq in living cells devoid of endogenous gαq/ <dig> proteins. using western blot analysis , we compared the expression level of endogenous gαq/ <dig> in mef cells from wild-type mice with that of gαq-myfp transduced into mefq/11-/-. gαq-myfp in mefq/11-/- was clearly less abundant than gαq/ <dig> in wild-type mef cells, indicating that the observed calcium responses are not simply due to overexpression.

correct localization of the heterotrimer requires cotransfection of the three subunits, as described previously  <cit> . to examine whether gαq-mtq forms a heterotrimer with the yfp-tagged gβγ dimer, steady-state fret efficiencies were measured in cells coexpressing gαq-mtq and yfp-gγ <dig>  the truncated version, gαq-mtqΔ <dig>  displayed a higher basal fret level  in the presence of yfp-gγ <dig>  compared with the non-truncated form  and was therefore used in gq activation measurements.

dynamic range of the gq sensor
during the course of our studies, jensen et al.  <cit>  published data on gq activation using fret ratio imaging with gαq-ecfp and eyfp-gβ <dig>  we compared the expression of gαq-ecfp with that of gαq-mtqΔ <dig> by transfecting cells with similar quantities of dna. cells expressing gαq-mtqΔ <dig> were readily visible, whereas cells expressing gαq-ecfp were substantially less fluorescent .

to determine the dynamic range of our gq activity sensor, we overexpressed the histamine h <dig> receptor  in hela cells, and compared the amplitude of the ratio change of our and the previously described sensor  <cit>  under identical conditions . we examined the expression of h1r and gαq-mtqΔ <dig> under these conditions. binding studies with a radiolabeled ligand revealed  <dig> fmol/mg binding sites, which is about fivefold higher than that of wild-type levels . western blotting  indicated that gαq-mtqΔ <dig> was expressed at a level equal to the endogenous gαq protein.

addition of histamine caused intensity changes with much larger amplitudes  in our gq sensor. the intensity traces unequivocally showed that, upon stimulation, the intensity of the donor  increased, whereas the sensitized emission of the acceptor  decreased , indicating a loss of fret and reflecting an increase in distance between the αb-αc loop of gαq and the n terminus of gγ <dig>  or a change in orientation. these clear, reciprocal changes in cfp and yfp intensities were not seen for the other sensor under identical circumstances . the results confirm the improved fluorescence properties of mturquoise  <cit>  and the benefits of deleting the six c-terminal amino acids of this tag.

addition of the h1r inverse agonist mepyramine  <cit>  readily caused deactivation . under h1r overexpression conditions and in the continued presence of histamine in the medium, activation of gq remained unaltered for at least  <dig> minutes . similar changes were seen upon overexpression of the bk receptor type  <dig> .

to ascertain the effect of using yfp-gγ <dig> as acceptor instead of eyfp-gβ <dig>  we determined the fret change in cells coexpressing gαq-mtqΔ <dig> and eyfp-gβ <dig> . using eyfp-gβ <dig> as acceptor clearly diminished the amplitude of the response, indicating that the use of yfp-gγ <dig> as an acceptor increases the sensitivity of the sensor. when gαq-ecfp was used together with the acceptor yfp-gγ <dig>  a more robust fret change was seen . in summary, these data show that the combination of gαq-mtqΔ <dig> and yfp-gγ <dig> significantly improve the response of the gq activity sensor.

to investigate the sensitivity of our sensor , we overexpressed h1r and tested the response of the sensor to a range of agonist concentrations . interestingly, a transient fret change was seen upon stimulation with  <dig>  μmol/l histamine, whereas its duration was prolonged upon addition of higher amounts of histamine. it seems that the amount of active gq accumulates progressively every time the total concentration of histamine is increased, and that concomitantly, active gq is desensitized less efficiently at each new histamine addition.

kinetics of gq activation
an important parameter describing the gq activation kinetics is its activation rate  upon receptor activation. to date, no conclusive data has been produced to quantify this kinetic parameter. by monitoring the fret change kinetics of the fret pair  upon addition of histamine, we were able to determine the activation kinetics of the heterotrimer. activation of gq was too fast to be measured by our widefield set-up , therefore the experiments were repeated using a laser-scanning microscope with a resonant scanner. with this, it was possible to perform ratio imaging of fret with a frame rate of around  <dig> frames/s, which provided sufficient temporal resolution to measure the kinetics of gαq activation by h <dig> receptors . the activation kinetics was appropriately fitted using a monoexponential curve, yielding a half-time for activation of  <dig> ms , implying that kon = 2/s.

influence of accessory proteins on the activation state of gq
besides studying activation kinetics under receptor overexpression conditions, we were interested in obtaining data in the absence of overexpressed receptors. stimulation of the endogenous  <cit>  histamine receptor type  <dig>  in hela cells by addition of histamine also led to a measurable fret decrease , but with markedly different kinetics. because gα subunits cycle between their inactive  and active  states, the duration of the active state is limited by its intrinsic gtp hydrolysis and gtp-ase activating protein  activity executed by accessory proteins. remarkably, even in the continuous presence of agonist, the activation state of gq is partially desensitized , contrary to reports for gαi  <cit>  and gαs   <cit> . clearly, under h1r overexpression conditions , the activation state of gq is prolonged. gαq can be stimulated to hydrolyze its bound gtp by both regulators of g-protein signalling  proteins and phospholipase cβ isozymes  <cit> . to test the role of rgs proteins in desensitization of active gq, an rgs-insensitive gαq-mtqΔ <dig> was constructed by mutating g <dig> in switch i into s <dig>  this mutation has been shown to inhibit binding of rgs proteins to gαq , while leaving the intrinsic rate of gtp hydrolysis unchanged. fret measurements using gαq-mtqΔ6-g188s and yfp-gγ <dig> show that the onset of gq activation is slower. desensitization also seems to be compromised, albeit not completely absent .

next, we studied the influence of the recently described effector of gq, p63rhogef  <cit> , on the activation state of gq. strikingly, coexpression of p63rhogef again caused an increase in the observed ratio changes between gαq-mtqΔ <dig> and yfp-gγ <dig> upon addition of histamine . the decrease in fret readily returned to baseline upon addition of mepyramine . importantly, the gαq-interaction mutant p63rhogef-l475a  <cit>  did not induce such an increase .

the prolonged fret response with stimulation in the presence of p63rhogef or overexpressed h1r enabled us to apply the more quantitative flim technique to measure fret levels. with flim, the excited state lifetime of the donor fluorophores is determined. in the case of fret, the excited state duration is shortened because of transfer of energy to the acceptor  <cit> . because fluorescence lifetimes do not depend on local excitation intensity or fluorophore concentration, and are largely unaffected by moderate levels of photobleaching of the fluorophores, flim is a very robust method to quantify fret in living cells  <cit> . in the case of frequency-domain flim, two lifetimes can be measured, that is, the phase lifetime and the modulation lifetime, which both decrease in fret.

the flim data revealed a reduction of the mturquoise modulation lifetime  and phase lifetime from  <dig>  ns  to  <dig>  ns in the presence of its acceptor yfp-gγ <dig> . these lifetimes correspond to a fret efficiency of 26%. in the presence of h1r, similar fret efficiencies were seen in resting cells, but upon addition of histamine, the donor lifetime increased. similar increases were found by stimulating cells coexpressing p63rhogef with the gq fret sensor. these results unequivocally showed a decrease in fret in the gq sensor upon gpcr stimulation , corroborating the ratiometric data.

ligand-independent activation of h1r activates gq
recently, mederos y schnitzler et al.  <cit>  reported that certain gpcrs function as sensors of membrane stretch, with the h <dig> receptor being particularly mechanosensitive compared with at1r, m5r and v1ar. membrane stretch can be induced by the application of a hypotonic stimulus . first, we examined whether hypotonic stimulation of endogenous h <dig> receptors of hela cells could induce gq activation, and found that it was not sufficient to produce a measurable gq activation, as a ratio change was not seen . importantly, the same cells were capable of responding to histamine .

next, we examined whether overexpression of h <dig> receptors could trigger gq activation upon application of a hypotonic stimulus. a clear fret decrease was seen in these cells , indicating gq activation. these results suggest ligand-independent activation of mechanosensitive h1r, leading to the activation of gq. the activation of gq, as detected by the decrease in fret, led to activation of plcβ. we visualized the activity of plc by monitoring the ph domain of plcδ <dig> , which specifically binds ptdinsp <dig>  <cit> . addition of a hypotonic stimulus caused the phδ <dig> domain to translocate from the plasma membrane to the cytosol, indicative of the hydrolysis of ptdinsp <dig> . consecutive addition of mepyramine did not affect the localization of phδ <dig>  suggesting that the activation of h1r by stretch cannot be inhibited by an antagonist.

discussion
characteristics of the gq fret sensor
to evaluate functionality, we extensively tested the vfp-tagged gq in mef cells deficient in gq/ <dig>  the results in these cells showed that gαq-mtqΔ <dig> effectively interacts with gpcrs and plcβ . in addition, we can state that it can also form heterotrimers with gβγ subunits, because receptors bound gα subunits poorly and failed to trigger gdp exchange in the absence of gβγ  <cit> . moreover, we saw substantial fret when gαq-mtqΔ <dig> was coexpressed with an yfp-tagged gγ <dig> 

the spatiotemporal characteristics of heterotrimeric g protein activation are difficult to monitor, because direct measurement of gtp binding and hydrolysis is not feasible in living cells  <cit> . instead, an increase in intracellular calcium, measured using calcium-sensitive fluorescent probes, is often used as an indicator of gq activity. however, other heterotrimeric g proteins can cause increases in intracellular calcium by means of calcium entry from the extracellular environment, and by activation of plcβ via gβγ dimers  <cit> . in addition, increases in intracellular calcium triggered by gq-coupled receptors are amplified signals that are modulated by downstream factors . hence, they are not ideal to quantify the extent and dynamics of g protein activation. the fret pair described here enables the direct measurement of heterotrimeric g protein activation. through the use of an optimized fluorophore, the bright cfp variant mturquoise , positioned in an orientation yielding a higher basal fret efficiency level in the intact heterotrimer, in combination with yfp-gγ <dig> as an acceptor, we were able to measure gq activation kinetics in single cells with high temporal resolution.

the half-time of gq activation of  <dig> ms is faster than those of gs and gi    <cit> . as receptor-g-protein interaction has been shown to be maximal after about  <dig> ms for several gpcr-g-protein pairs  <cit> , it is likely that the h1r-gq interaction displays similar kinetics. only a few gq heterotrimers will be active at this early time point. full activation of gq proteins requires several hundred milliseconds, making g-protein activation  a limiting step in gpcr activation of downstream effectors. interestingly, mukhopadhyay and ross  <cit>  described the kinetics of gq activation in vitro, and found gtp exchange to be rate-limiting for gq activation. however, at cellular gtp levels, the gdp dissociation rate became rate-limiting. the gdp dissociation rate was found to be  <dig> /s, which correlates well with the rate of gq activation determined by means of our fret sensor in living cells.

previous studies with fret sensors on activation of other classes of heterotrimeric g proteins showed a sustained activity in the continued presence of agonist  <cit> . for example, gi activation only desensitizes noticeably upon removal of the agonist or addition of specific antagonists  <cit> . in our study, we also saw a long-lasting gq activation in the presence of agonist when the histamine receptor was overexpressed , but the activation was readily reversed when an antagonist was added. by contrast, gq activation was partially desensitized when endogenous histamine receptors were activated . presumably, this recovery is possible because gaps are able to convert gαq-gtp into gαq-gdp under these conditions. indeed, upon introduction of g188s in gαq-mtqΔ <dig>  the gq activation kinetics changed compared with those of gαq-mtqΔ6; the response had a slower onset and prolonged activation . clark and lambert also described these phenomena previously  <cit> . however, in our case the observed phenotype was rather weak, which may imply that plcβ is the physiological gap in our system. importantly, the dose-response curve analysis  showed that the fret change was also transient at low agonist concentrations under conditions in which histamine receptor was overexpressed. the histamine levels we used are in the physiological range, that is, whole blood levels were 25- <dig> ng/ml of histamine  <cit> , corresponding to histamine concentrations in whole blood of  <dig> - <dig>  μmol/l. our data suggest that cells overexpressing h1r may show a small, transient gq activation response to these histamine levels in blood.

influence of accessory proteins on the activation state of gq
overexpression of p63rhogef led to an increase in the fret ratio amplitude , but the gαq-interaction mutant, p63rhogef-l475a, did not have an effect on the amplitude . it is likely that p63rhogef retains gq in its active state by shielding it from the gap plcβ, thereby accumulating gαq-gtp.

the question of whether intact heterotrimers or dissociated g-proteins  activate downstream effectors has not been resolved to date, and most of our knowledge has been obtained from structural studies with purified proteins. gαq-gdp and gβγ interact through two interfaces. the most extensive interface is formed by residues close to and within switch i and ii from the gα subunit. these residues contact gβ residues at the top of the propeller domain. the second interface is formed by the n terminus of gα and the side of the gβ propeller  <cit> . gβ is most severely affected in binding to gα when it contains mutations in the region that interacts with the n terminus of gα, indicating that the n terminus is crucial in mediating the interaction with gβ  <cit> . it may therefore be envisioned that, upon activation, the contact of gβ with the switch regions is lost, whereas its contact with the n terminus remains, as suggested by gibson and gilman  <cit> . this would enable an opening up of the trimer, allowing gα and gβγ to interact with their downstream signalling partners. however, activation of certain effectors may require complete dissociation of the heterotrimer. accessory proteins may cause dissociation of gαq and gβγ by forcing them apart. the recently published crystal structure of the g protein-coupled receptor kinase grk <dig> in complex with gαq-gtp and gβγ exemplifies this idea  <cit> . it showed that grk <dig> interacts with gβγ residues implicated in both interfaces, thereby probably causing trimer dissociation.

the increases in fret ratio amplitude that we observed may be due to an increase in fully dissociated heterotrimers, which causes a loss of fret. however, a loss in fret can also be explained by a change in orientation between donor and acceptor fluorophore via the k <dig> factor in the equation that determines the förster radius. interestingly, even under conditions of maximal gef and minimal gap activity, we detected extensive fret  between gαq and gγ <dig>  indicating that the majority of gαq is still in close proximity to gγ <dig> . these data would support the partial opening hypothesis as outlined above, implying that full dissociation does not occur. however, although it indicated that gq is not fully dissociated under these maximal stimulation conditions, our method cannot distinguish between a partial dissociation leaving a fraction of non-dissociated heterotrimers with unaltered high fret efficiency  and a full conformational change of all heterotrimers characterized by a lower fret efficiency. importantly, others have proposed a signalling role for the intact gq heterotrimer  <cit> .

ligand-independent activation of h1r activates gq
ligand-independent activation of gpcrs is a new and not yet fully explored phenomenon. it was described by mederos y schnitzler et al.  <cit>  in hek <dig> cells and cos- <dig> cells overexpressing the histamine h <dig> receptor, among others. conformational changes in gpcr  upon addition of a hypotonic stimulus and consecutive receptor activation have been described for bk2r in bovine aortic endothelial cells  <cit> , for pth1r  in pre-osteoblastic cells  <cit> , and for at1r  in hek <dig> cells  <cit> . studying mechanotransduction is especially important with respect to its effects on the cardiovascular system. for instance, mechanical stress to cardiomyocytes can trigger hypertrophic responses  <cit> . using our gq activity sensor, we were able to monitor gq activation upon application of a hypotonic stimulus. overexpression of h1r was required to observe a ratio change. interestingly, we did observe an increase in the ratio change of the gq fret sensor in the presence of endogenous h1r upon addition of histamine, after hypotonic swelling of the cells. this suggests that heterotrimeric g proteins are triggered to bind the endogenous h <dig> receptor upon hypotonic stress, which may lead to changes in orientation of or distance between a small fraction of trimers. this pre-accumulation at the h1r might explain the larger amplitude seen upon addition of histamine, compared with that seen without prior exposure to hypotonic stress .

determination of h1r expression levels showed that in our cells overexpression produced an average of  <dig> fmol/mg binding sites. similarly, in a7r <dig> cells derived from the aorta  overexpression of the at <dig> receptor of about  <dig> times  induced mechanosensitivity  <cit> . moreover, the expression of at1r in the aorta has been described to be  <dig> fmol/mg  <cit> , whereas it can be up to  <dig> fmol/mg in the afferent arterioles   <cit> .

a conformational change in the at <dig> receptor upon mechanical stress has been described  <cit> . currently, it is not clear how this conformational change is triggered, and whether all mechanosensitive gpcrs undergo a similar change in conformation. it is likely that a fret approach may shed more light on this matter.

CONCLUSIONS
by virtue of the optimized gq fret sensor described in this paper, the activation of gq can now directly be measured with high spatial and temporal resolution in single living cells without having to rely on pharmacological inhibitors to delineate the involvement of specific signalling pathways. as a result we have determined kon of gq for the first time. it is likely that fret-based sensors for the measurement of other classes of g proteins, which employ ecfp as donor and eyfp-gβ <dig> as acceptor, will be substantially improved by incorporating  mturquoise and using yfp-gγ <dig> as acceptor.

inhibitors of g proteins are attractive drug candidates  <cit> . the fact that overexpression of the c terminus of gαq has a positive effect on cardiac hypertrophy indicates a possible strategy for preventing pathophysiological signalling  <cit> . the fret pair we developed may aid in the search for new drugs by facilitating highly sensitive gq activity measurements in living cells. moreover, we have shown that this tool can be used to study the kinetics of heterotrimeric g protein signalling and the influence of accessory proteins.
