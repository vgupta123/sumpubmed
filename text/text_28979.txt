BACKGROUND
a well-known phenomenon among bacteria is the sole utilization of the most favored carbon source  over other sugars present in the environment. the regulatory mechanism coordinating the metabolism of carbon and energy sources in order to maximize the metabolic efficiency is called carbon catabolite control, i.e., carbon catabolite repression  and carbon catabolite activation . carbon catabolite control in bacillus subtilis and other low-gc gram-positive bacteria is exerted by the ccpa protein   <cit> . ccpa is a member of the laci/galr family of transcriptional regulators  <cit>  and it can act either as a positive or negative regulator of genes that are in most cases involved in carbon acquisition or metabolism  <cit> . ccpa is synthesized constitutively, regardless to the availability of preferred carbon sources  <cit> , it forms a dimer  <cit>  and its activity is modulated by a complex interaction with either one of the corepressors, hpr or crh  <cit> . in the presence of glucose or other rapidly metabolized carbon sources, the histidine-containing protein , and an hpr-like protein , are phosphorylated on a conserved ser- <dig> residue by hpr kinase  <cit> . binding of the seryl-phosphorylated hpr  or crh  to ccpa stimulates the activity of ccpa  <cit> . during growth on carbohydrates there is much more hpr than crh in the cell  <cit> . notably, the crh-specific function in the regulation of expression during growth on substrates other than carbohydrates was recently revealed  <cit> . hence, crh seems to play a secondary role in ccr. next to hpr and crh, low-molecular-weight molecules like nadp, glucose-6-phosphate , and fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate  modulate ccpa activity by either stimulation of hpr kinase activity   <cit> , enhancement of ccpa affinity for hpr-ser-p   <cit> , triggering cooperative ccpa binding to dna   <cit> , or enhancing the ccpa interaction with the transcription machinery   <cit> .

ccpa binds to dna at cis-acting sequences called catabolite responsive elements  located in the promoter region or within open reading frames of the regulated genes and operons. so far more than  <dig> cre sites were identified in the b. subtilis genome  <cit> . a general rule was deduced, stating that genes with cre boxes located upstream of − <dig> sequences of the promoter are subject to activation by the ccpa complex, as shown for acka <cit> , pta <cit> ilvb <cit> . however, acka is cooperatively activated by ccpa and cody  <cit>  and full activation of acka requires also an additional conserved sequence present upstream of the cre box  <cit> . moreover, the lev operon is subject to ccpa repression, although the lev cre site is located upstream of the promoter. however, regulation of the lev operon involves also the levr transcriptional activator: binding of ccpa to the lev cre site prevents a productive interaction between levr and rna polymerase  <cit> . binding of ccpa to cre boxes overlapping the promoter leads to transcriptional repression by interfering with the transcription machinery binding, as for amyebglpcccadctpglpfphopacua <cit> . the binding of the protein complex to cre boxes that are located downstream of the transcription start site blocks transcription elongation, as is the case for most of the genes and operons regulated by ccpa  <cit> .

cre boxes are highly degenerate pseudo-palindromes with the consensus sequence wtgnnarcgnwwwcaw, where the strongly conserved residues are underlined  <cit> . little is known about how ccpa can bind to such diverse cre sequences. our hypothesis was that ccpa can bind with different affinities to cre boxes with particular sequence and/or position in relation to the transcription start site . in order to identify cre boxes with different affinities, ccpa expression was induced to three different levels using a tetracycline-dependent gene regulation system  <cit>  and genome wide analysis of cre boxes was performed using transcriptome analyses combined with bioinformatics tools. high- and low-affinity cre boxes with subtle differences in their sequence and/or position in relation to the tss are revealed.

RESULTS
tight regulation of ccpa production level
in order to enable very tight control of the ccpa expression level in b. subtilis, strain mp <dig>  was constructed. strain mp <dig> carries the ccpa gene under control of the tetracycline-inducible promoter, ptet, integrated in the native promoter locus and the ptet repressor, tetr, under control of the xylose-inducible promoter, pxyl, located on the plasmid pwh <dig>  <cit> . to show tight regulation of the ccpa expression level, the mp <dig> strain was grown in rich ty medium  <cit>  supplemented with 1 % glucose,  <dig>  % xylose and a wide range of concentrations  of ptet inducer, anhydrotetracycline  which is a non-bacteriostatic tetracycline analog. as demonstrated in figure  <dig>  the system allows obtaining several distinct expression levels of ccpa.

in order to test the influence of the different ccpa amounts in the cells on the ccpa regulon, three representative ccpa expression levels  were chosen and the cultures were used for microarray experiments. for transcriptome analyses, the mp <dig> strain was grown in rich ty medium  <cit> , since most likely it contains inducers for secondary regulators which could hide ccr in minimal medium and the samples were taken during exponential growth because ccr is expected to be strongest during maximal cell growth. the strain was grown in the presence of  <dig>  % xylose to induce tetr expression and a high concentration of glucose  in order to ensure sufficient production of ccpa cofactors like hpr-ser-p, nadp, glucose-6-phosphate  or fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate  and optimal activity of ccpa. the medium was supplemented with different concentrations of atc, exerting different ccpa production levels in the different cultures:  <dig>  nm atc ,  <dig> nm atc  and  <dig> nm atc . the control culture was grown without atc leading to no or only residual ccpa production. the ccpa production levels of the different mp <dig> cultures used for microarray experiments were assessed by western blotting .

effect of different ccpa amounts on gene regulation
the transcriptional profiles of exponentially growing cells of b. subtilis mp <dig>  grown in rich medium supplemented with glucose and xylose and expressing ccpa at low, medium and high levels  due to the presence of different concentrations of the ptet inducer, atc, were compared to the transcriptional profile of mp <dig> cells grown in the corresponding medium but without atc . our first observation was that the more ccpa present in the cells the more genes were found to be significantly regulated . genes were considered to be regulated if they were at least  <dig>  fold up- or downregulated. when ccpa was expressed at low, medium and high levels,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed, respectively. ccpa is known to act, depending on the cre box position in relation to the transcriptional start site , as a repressor or activator  <cit> , but many more cases of repression than of activation are known  <cit> . consistently, most of the regulated genes found in the microarray analyses with different ccpa induction levels were downregulated. for the list of expression fold changes of all the genes in the b. subtilis genome in all the three microarray experiments see additional file  <dig> in the supplementary material.

the first genes of operons known from the literature to possess cre boxes  and which were differentially expressed at least under the high ccpa production level were extracted from the microarray data. since it is estimated that the ccpa regulon includes more members than known so far  <cit> , as also shown recently  <cit> , a prediction of putative cre boxes was performed. using genome2d  <cit>  and a list of described cre boxes in the literature  a weight matrix of cre boxes was generated: t1g2a3a4a5r6c7g8y9t10w11w12c13a <dig>  this cre motif was used to search the whole b. subtilis genome for putative cre boxes. as a result,  <dig> putative cre boxes were found:  <dig> in the upper and  <dig> in the lower strand . most of the predicted cre boxes may not be functional taking into account their large distance from the promoter. therefore, cre boxes located within − <dig> and + <dig> nucleotides relative to the start codon of the first gene of an operon were extracted. there were  <dig> genes possessing cre boxes that met these criteria . since the search did not entirely cover the list of the known cre sites , cre sites known from literature were also added to the analyzed cre sites. in total, there were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> operons possessing  cre sites and which were significantly downregulated under low, medium or high ccpa induction level, respectively. three operons with known and predicted cre sites were activated under all these conditions . for the sequences of the regions between − <dig> and + <dig> nucleotides from the start codon of first genes of operons possessing cre boxes that were analyzed in this study, see additional file  <dig>  the increase in amount of ccpa-regulated operons upon increasing amounts of ccpa indicates the presence of high-affinity cre boxes titrating away ccpa from the weaker cre boxes, which can trigger regulation of additional genes only when more functional ccpa is present in the cell. therefore, the  <dig> cre boxes of the  <dig> operons  repressed when ccpa was present in low amounts were designated as strong  and the other  <dig> cre sites of  <dig> operons , which were repressed only in the presence of higher amounts of ccpa in the cells , were designated as weak  . the high- and low-affinity, and the three activating cre boxes  were analyzed with respect to their sequence and their position relative to the tss. the term ‘affinity’ in this study is contractual, as direct binding assays were not performed in this study, and it is used to denote hierarchy in ccpa target genes regulation. from other  studies it is however apparent that strong regulation commonly coincides with high affinity and vice versa, so the term affinity appears to be adequate to describe differences in strong or weak regulation.

analysis of cre box affinities in relation to their sequence
in order to detect differences within the sequence between different cre boxes, which putatively determine the cre box affinity, separate weight matrices for high- and low-affinity cre boxes that are responsible for gene repression were generated using genome2d  <cit>  . the resulting consensus sequences are t1g2a3a4a5g6c7g8c9t10t11t12c13a <dig> and t1g2a3a4a5r6c7g8y9t10t11t12c13w <dig>  for strong and weak cre boxes, respectively. cre boxes from both groups have very conserved g <dig>  c <dig> and g <dig> residues, as in cre motifs proposed before  <cit> . although the differences between high- and low-affinity cre are not very pronounced, the cre boxes with high affinity to ccpa seem to have a more conserved sequence around the middle cpg  and at the c <dig> and a <dig> positions . to analyze the differences in the cre sequences in more detail, the high- and low-affinity cre boxes were aligned. the alignments show that the strong cre boxes  have, on average, more palindromic residues than the weak cre boxes  particularly at the external residues and in the middle cpg.

the cre sites of the genes that were activated in this study  were not included in the weight matrix generation nor cre alignment as cre boxes that are responsible for gene expression activation may need additional  sequences, as shown for instance for acka <cit> . moreover, their sequence might putatively differ from the repressing cre sites, but the population of activating cre sites is too small to perform statistically significant analysis. however, taking into account the fact that all three genes that were activated in the microarray experiments in this study are regulated already in presence of low amounts of ccpa in the cell, the activating cre sites seem to take a higher place in the hierarchy of the genes regulated by ccpa. additionally, the cre sites of ilvb and ycbp appear to match the consensus of the high-affinity cre boxes better compared to the consensus of low-affinity cre boxes .

analysis of the influence of relative cre box position on regulation
to find out whether the cre box position in relation to the promoter plays a role in determining the affinity to ccpa, the distance between cre boxes and the corresponding transcription start sites  was analyzed. the tss of the regulated genes possessing a cre box were extracted from the literature or, when this information was lacking, predicted in this study . the calculated cre to tss distance  was plotted against expression level fold change of the regulated genes under high levels of ccpa, separately for the genes with either high  and low affinity cre boxes . the majority of high affinity cre boxes are localized in close vicinity to the tss  and around positions − <dig>  - <dig> and + <dig>  repression of the genes with cre sites located with increment of approximately 10– <dig> nt  was significantly stronger, such as found for cre boxes of acor, glpf, dctp, gmub, xynp, trep, which are localized at positions − <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  + <dig>  + <dig>  + <dig>  respectively. further downstream from the tss, there are more low affinity cre boxes than high affinity ones.

discussion
ccpa is a global regulator of carbon catabolism  <cit>  controlling expression of genes by binding to cognate operator sequences, cre, which is characterized by a low-conserved consensus sequence  <cit> . hence, it seems possible that ccpa binds some cre sites with higher affinity than others. so far, the global studies of ccpa-dependent carbon catabolite repression were focused on identification of the members of the ccpa regulon  <cit> , while the analysis of cre boxes in respect to their sequences, position and affinities in ccpa binding have been focused only on single examples  <cit> . a broader comparison of  <dig> cre boxes sequences and function was published by miwa y. et al. and it was deduced that a lower mismatching of cre sequences to the query sequence in the same direction as that of transcription of the target genes and a more palindromic sequence of cre boxes are desirable for their better function  <cit> . the goal of our study was to perform a genome-wide analysis of cre boxes in order to reveal cre boxes with high and low binding affinities by comparing the ccpa regulon under three distinct conditions, where different amounts of ccpa were present in the cells and to identify cre features that determine this affinity.

using a tetracycline-dependent gene regulation system  <cit>  we achieved a tightly-controlled ccpa expression, leading to a wide range of ccpa amounts in the cells. b. subtilis cultures with relative low, medium or high amounts of ccpa in the cells were subjected to transcriptome analyses. the cells were grown in the presence of glucose to ensure sufficient production of low-molecular-weight modulators of ccpa activity . as expected, higher levels of ccpa protein lead to more genes significantly up- or downregulated. most of the regulated genes, however, were affected indirectly, as they were lacking a cre site. genes regulated indirectly in a ccpa-dependent manner  were already observed before and were proposed to be grouped in class ii, next to class i that includes genes regulated by ccpa directly  <cit> . in our analysis, only genes belonging to class i were taken into account as the subject of this study was the nature of discriminating cre boxes. many repressed genes are σa-dependent and do not need another inducing protein for their expression. however, expression of some genes is regulated by more than one regulator. in those rare cases of multiple regulation, the full extent of regulation would not be observed in our transcriptome analysis, but this does not affect our analysis since we are looking at the relative strength of repression at different ccpa concentrations.

the search for putative cre boxes in the b. subtilis genome, using a cre motif generated from the cre boxes known from dbtbs  <cit> , t1g2a3a4a5r6c7g8y9t10w11w12c13a <dig>  resulted in  <dig> putative cre boxes. the majority of the predicted cre boxes were within orfs far away from promoters and, although functional cre boxes located within coding sequences are present in the b. subtilis genome, a lot of the predicted cre sites seemed to be at a too large distance from the promoter to possibly be able to play a role in regulation of gene expression. therefore, cre boxes located within − <dig> and + <dig> nucleotides from the first nucleotide of a start codon of the first genes of an operon were extracted. also cre boxes triggering gene regulation that are known from the literature, but not predicted by our method, were included in our analysis. the genes differentially expressed at least at a high ccpa production level and possessing cre box known from literature  <cit>  and/or predicted in this study were selected. among the selected genes,  <dig> were downregulated and  <dig> were upregulated at a low ccpa induction level, while the other  <dig> genes were downregulated only when ccpa was produced at higher levels . for all these genes, expression fold changes were calculated as ratios of the amounts of transcripts downstream of cre boxes as the microarray chip probes were synthesized upstream from them. of the regulated first genes of operons possessing known and/or predicted cre box, chip probes of only kdgr and resa were upstream from kdgrcre and second cre of resa . therefore, these cre boxes were not included in the sequence and position analysis of cre boxes. since regulation depends on ccpa-cre binding, cre boxes causing significant regulation of downstream operons already when a small amount of ccpa is available are supposed to have a high affinity to ccpa and titrate ccpa away from low-affinity cre sites, which are able to exert regulation of other operons only when more ccpa is present. notably, over a dozen of known cre’s fell out of our data set, because the corresponding genes were not significantly regulated in any of the three microarray experiments. despite of the fact that they could be considered as very low-affinity sites, they were not included in the analysis as lack of the differential expression might have been a false negative result due to, e.g., high background signal, bad spot quality on the microarray slides, mrna degradation, growth conditions, more complex regulation or yet unidentified factors. moreover, it should be noted that division of cre boxes to two affinity groups is a simplification necessary for this analysis. very likely a gradient distribution of cre site affinities occurs in nature, which would be difficult to assess.

the detailed analysis of the sequences of high- and low-affinity cre boxes, led to a few interesting observations. the g <dig> and middle c <dig> and g <dig> residues , known as highly conserved residues  <cit>  are conserved in both high- and low-affinity cre boxes. interestingly, the high-affinity cre boxes have more conserved g <dig> and c <dig> surrounding the middle cpg and c <dig>  and a <dig>  and their sequences are significantly more palindromic overall. it was observed before that a more palindromic sequence of cre sites contributes to a better function  <cit> . the more palindromic nature of the high-affinity cre sites  might create a more symmetric dna conformation, preferred for ccpa binding. although the bases at positions  <dig> and  <dig> are more often palindromic to each other in the weak cre boxes, this is obviously less important for the cre strength. in a previous study  <cit>  it was shown that ccpa binds with similar affinities to different cre boxes, which explains well the role of ccpa as a global regulator. however, the three cre boxes tested in that work differ very little around the middle cpg and in their symmetry  and they did not differ at the residues corresponding to our c <dig> nor a <dig> 

comparison of the high- and low-affinity cre boxes location in relation to the tss also shows some trends. while the low-affinity cre sites can be located at any position from the tss, the high-affinity cre sites cluster around the tss,  <dig> and  <dig> base pairs upstream from tss and  <dig> base pairs downstream from tss. simultaneously, the strongest repression by ccpa was observed for the genes with cre sites located around the tss  and at positions − <dig> , - <dig> , + <dig>  and + <dig>  base pairs from the tss, which are separated by approximately  <dig> - 11-nt increments . this observation is in agreement with previous findings that activation or repression by ccpa binding to cre boxes is helix-face-dependent  <cit> . also in lactococcus lactis the strongest repression by ccpa was shown to occur when the center of cre box was located − <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  + <dig> and + <dig> from the tss  <cit> .

it was shown before that genes with cre boxes located further upstream from − <dig> sequences of the promoter are subject to activation by the ccpa complex as in case of acka <cit> , pta <cit>  and ilvb <cit> . in our work however, under the tested conditions, only three genes were activated: ilvbopue and ycbp . we did not observe activation of acka in this study. this is probably due to the very low basal expression of ccpa from the tetr repressed promoter that might be high enough for binding of ccpa to the acka cre box and for full activation of the acka promoter. in this case, a further increase of ccpa does not result in an additional increase of acka expression. surprisingly, pta was downregulated. however, in this study both test and control cultures were grown in medium supplemented with glucose. the mechanism of pta regulation in this case is thus different from low glucose-dependent cca. based on our criteria, the cre boxes of all three activated genes are of the high affinity type. although the ycbp cre box appears to be downstream to the tss , both the cre box and the tss in this case are not experimentally confirmed.

some genes and operons possess multiple cre boxes. since dna microarray technology was used in this study to assess expression fold changes of genes and operons in the presence of different amounts of ccpa, we were not always able to judge whether the effect is due to one cre box  or more. in our set  there were only two operons with two cre boxes . gntr was weakly regulated , suggesting that the regulatory effects of the two cre boxes do not add up to exert strong regulation. in case of the iola operon, each of the two cre boxes is located within another gene of the operon . in this case, the regulatory effects of these cre boxes could be assessed independently. based on the fold changes of iola  and iolb , both cre- <dig> and cre- <dig> seem to be of high affinity. multiple cre boxes could serve for fine tuning of ccpa-regulated genes and operons.

for the genes with cre boxes located close to the tss and downstream, distinct repression mechanisms were proposed. elongation blockage  was shown for xylara and gnt operons, as well as sigl and acsa <cit> . prevention of binding rnap to the promoter sequence was demonstrated for the acuabc and bglph operons possessing cre partially overlapping with the promoter region  <cit> . transcription inhibition by direct interaction of ccpa with the σ-subunit of rnap already bound to the promoter was shown in case of the amye gene and xyl operon  <cit> . the presence of a high-affinity cre box in close vicinity to the tss shown in this study, suggests that repression by inhibition of rnap binding is one of the most effective mechanism of negative regulation by ccpa.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we propose that besides the strongly conserved g <dig> residue and the middle cpg, the residues g <dig> and c <dig> , c <dig> and a <dig> and, to a certain extent a more palindromic sequence and a location of cre in close vicinity to the tss, contribute to the high affinity of ccpa for certain cre boxes. this finding contributes to further understanding how ccpa binding to cre boxes is modulated and how subregulons can be formed. however, not all the cre boxes behave strictly according to this rule, suggesting that cre affinity is possibly determined in an even more complicated way. the cre sequence and position may play a role simultaneously and/or more factors may be involved, for instance additional conserved sequences as shown for acka <cit>  or sequences flanking cre sites as in case of acsa <cit> .

it will be interesting to use these predictions for other g-positive organisms employing ccpa, like other bacilli, lactic acid bacteria, or pathogenic streptococci and staphylococci.
