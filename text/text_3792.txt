BACKGROUND
matricellular or extracellular proteins do not contribute structurally to the extracellular milieu instead regulate the cell matrix interactions  <cit> . basement membrane- <dig> , sparc  is an anti-adhesive secreted matricellular glycoprotein family  <cit>  associated with tissue remodeling during normal developmental processes such as angiogenesis and bone mineralization  <cit> . enhanced expression of sparc has been reported in malignant tumors  <cit>  and during early stages of embryogenesis but remain restricted in adult tissues  <cit> . the biological attributes of sparc is to regulate the activities of collagen iv  <cit>  platelet-derived growth factor   <cit>  and vascular endothelial growth factor   <cit> .

sparc family proteins are characterized by the presence of a follistatin-like  and a c-terminal extracellular  calcium binding domains with two ef-hand binding motifs  <cit> . this family includes sc1/hevin/qr <dig>  <cit> , testican  <cit> , tsc36/flik/frp  <cit>  and the recently described smoc- <dig>  <cit>  and smoc- <dig>  <cit> . in addition to a calcium-binding ec domain, smoc- <dig> consists of two thyroglobulin-like  domains, an fs domain and a novel smoc- <dig> specific domain. smoc- <dig> was localized within the basement membrane of various murine tissues and organs of different embryonic stages suggesting its significant role in embryonic development  <cit> . a perusal of literature, thus far, has not shown association of this gene with any satellites.

satellite dna represents a dynamic component of the eukaryotic genome  <cit> . the evolutionary conservation of a number of minisatellites either associated with non-coding or coding genes and their polymorphic status within/across the species suggest their vital regulatory roles in eukaryotic genomes  <cit> . however, association of minisatellites with the transcripts is thought to either regulate the transcription or bind proteins with diverse functional consequences  <cit> . in the earlier studies, we uncovered several transcripts representing known and novel genes from water buffalo using the minisatellite associated sequence amplification  approach and a consensus sequence of  <dig>  repeat loci  <cit>  originating from the human myoglobin gene  <cit> . of these transcripts, one was found to represent the partial cdna sequence of secreted modular calcium binding protein- <dig> , also known as sparc related calcium binding protein- <dig> 

here, we describe isolation and characterization of full length smoc- <dig> in water buffalo bubalus bubalis including its domain organization, copy number status, in silico structural and functional analysis, in-vitro protein expression & purification, tissue & age specific transcription/translation and localization of the same onto the metaphase chromosomes & basement membrane zone. biological significance of both the transcripts variants showing highest expression in liver is discussed.

RESULTS
characterization of buffalo smoc-1
the cloning strategy for isolation of full length smoc- <dig> cds of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp is demonstrated in fig. 1a &1b. clone i contained an insert of  <dig> bp  lacking 5'/3' utrs and signal peptide sequence  <cit> . clone ii  covered complete coding sequence from nucleotides 119– <dig> but with partial 5' & 3' utrs. the 3' utr was covered by three fragments represented by clone iii, iv & v of which clone iii covered nucleotides from 1461–2473; clone iv, 2307–3328; and clone v, 2435– <dig>  the polyadenylation signals were accessed with 3'race followed by sequencing of  <dig> recombinants. this resulted in the identification of two other clones . clone vii represented nucleotides 1407– <dig> followed by  <dig> mer poly tail. clone viii covered 2435– <dig> encompassing  <dig> mer poly tail. the 5' utr represented by clone vi  was generated by 5' race. following this strategy, full length cds of smoc- <dig>  was deduced from different overlapping fragments . the gc rich 5'-utr of  <dig> bp was followed by an initiating atg codon and the terminating taa codon fell at nucleotide  <dig>  thus, translation of the sequence from nucleotide  <dig> to  <dig> encodes a putative protein of  <dig> amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig> da with a predicted oxidoreductase activity. multiple sequence alignments showed that this protein is 95% and 98% identical to human & cattle smoc- <dig>  respectively .

buffalo smoc- <dig> shows two transcript variants
northern blot detected two bands of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb  which were confirmed to be two transcript variants of smoc- <dig> with race and sequencing , variant- <dig> of  <dig> bp  and variant- <dig> of  <dig> bp . both the variants encoded for identical proteins but showed differences in their 3'utr length, polyadenylation signals and poly tails. in the 3' utr of variant- <dig> & - <dig>  five & two copies of mrna instability motif , respectively, were observed. in addition, there were orthodox polyadenylation signals ,  <dig> and  <dig> bp downstream of the translation termination codon, in transcript variant- <dig> and - <dig>  respectively . interestingly, two types of transcripts of smoc- <dig> have been reported independently in the literature for human  and cattle . database search and multiple nucleotide sequence alignment of both the variants showed their conservation across various species .

structure of the buffalo smoc- <dig> and its phylogenetic delineation
the buffalo smoc- <dig> has  <dig> exons, varying in length from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in variant- <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> bp in variant- <dig>  . each domain of smoc- <dig> is encoded by one or more exons and the domain border coincide with the conserved splice sites. buffalo smoc- <dig> differed from other species in various aspects , briefly, exon  <dig> was found to be more diverse at nucleotide level whereas exon  <dig> comprising the follistatin domain was most divergent at amino acid level. exon  <dig> was the most conserved across the species. the buffalo smoc- <dig> cross-hybridized to genomic dna from  <dig> different species with almost equal signal intensity, confirming its faithful conservation across the species . phylogenetic analysis demonstrated cattle as the closest species followed by human and chimpanzee while dog was the most distant one . in addition, the buffalo smoc- <dig> also showed homology with other species such as birds, rodents and bony fishes . details of the smoc- <dig> gene from different species along with their accession numbers are given in the table  <dig> 

domain organization of smoc-1
homology search for the buffalo smoc- <dig> protein demonstrated presence of all the domains characteristic to the bm- <dig> family . accordingly, first  <dig> amino acids at the n-terminus conform well to the signal peptide consensus ending with a signal peptidase cleavage site  <cit> . mature smoc- <dig> comprises of  <dig> amino acids. like in the human, all the essential features of each domain are conserved in buffalo. since no transmembrane-spanning hydrophobic domain is present in the sequence, smoc- <dig> is presumably secreted out from the cells. further scrutiny allowed the distinction of five modules, an fs domain , a ty domain , a smoc- <dig> unique domain , a second ty domain  and an ec domain . residues 42– <dig> are homologous to the canonical fs domain, composed of two sub-domains with the second being similar to the kazal domain. structure-based alignment showed that all the six cysteines and the features of secondary structure are conserved in both the ty domains of buffalo smoc- <dig>  further, two ty domains  are separated by  <dig> amino acids unique to the smoc- <dig>  detailed in-silico analysis unveiled a potential n-glycosylation site at asn- <dig> and five o-glycosylation sites at thr- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> in buffalo smoc- <dig>  the c-terminus is homologous to the characteristic amphipathic α-helix and the helix-loop-helix motifs of the ecd of bm- <dig>  however, based on the in-silico analyses, in contrast to the ecd of bm- <dig>  both ef-hand motifs of smoc- <dig> were found canonical indicating the calcium binding sites . compared to other species, buffalo smoc- <dig> showed some specific alteration like r49k in fs domain and v <dig> insertion in ecd. some of these changes were from polar to non-polar amino acids and vice versa, similar to that in mouse/rat. in case of human/chimpanzee, these changes always maintained similar biochemical nature . interesting enough, predicted secondary structure showed alterations at the n-terminus involving replacement of  <dig> alpha-helices by equal number of beta-sheets and insertion of  <dig> helices in fs domain in comparison to other mammals .

single copy of the smoc- <dig> gene located on chromosome  <dig> in buffalo
for copy number status, using sybr green assay and real time pcr, a straight curve was obtained with a slope - <dig>  using  <dig> fold dilution series of buffalo blood/semen genomic dna and fsmoc- <dig> plasmid as template. ct increase of  <dig>  per dilution and a single dissociation peak indicated maximum efficiency and high specificity of the primer sets. extrapolation of this standard curve demonstrated the single copy status of the smoc- <dig> per haploid genome in buffalo . chromosomal mapping of the same was also performed using fluorescent in situ hybridization  which confirmed the localization of smoc- <dig> gene on the distal end of the acrocentric chromosome  <dig> in buffalo .

recombinant expression of smoc-1
affinity-purified recombinant smoc- <dig> expressed in e. coli bl <dig> revealed a major band at ~ <dig> kda in 10% sds-page under reduced conditions. the deduced molecular mass of mature smoc- <dig> is  <dig>  kda and remaining ~ <dig> kda represent gst tag. the anti-psmoc1-pab recognized native protein of ~ <dig> kda in the western-blot analysis. anti-sysmoc-1-pab generated against commercially synthesized  <dig> amino acids  also showed the similar result , substantiating its high specificity. the pre-immune serum did not detect any protein in the western blot .

highest expression of smoc- <dig> transcript variants in liver
northern blot analysis showed abundant smoc- <dig> transcripts in liver and faint signals in testis and ovary. after prolonged exposure, the spleen, lung, kidney and heart also showed negligible to faint signals . similarly, rt-pcr followed by southern hybridization detected reduced signals in spleen  and negligible ones in lung, kidney and heart after prolonged exposure . using quantitative expressional analysis, β-actin as an internal control and lung cdna as calibrator, the highest level of expression of transcript variant- <dig>  and - <dig>  was observed in liver . this was substantiated further by expression data from the five additional animals. in the same assay, sperm cdna showed similar level as that of testis. however, relatively higher amount  of variant- <dig> was observed in all the tissues examined as compared to that of variant- <dig> . based on these observations, the variant- <dig> may be addressed as "major transcript" and - <dig> as "minor" one.

since all the mrna transcripts may not translate into protein, the relative quantitation mentioned above was substantiated by the western blot analysis using total tissue proteins and anti-sysmoc1-pab which detected the ~ <dig> kda bands . interestingly, the strongest signal was detected in liver and faint ones in testis, ovary and spleen  whereas lung, kidney and heart were found to be devoid of smoc- <dig> protein corroborating the rt-pcr and relative expressional analysis. as a control, anti-β-actin-mab showed almost equal signal intensity in each tissue .

age specific progression of expression of smoc- <dig> in water buffalo
we report for the first time, expression profile of smoc- <dig> in water buffaloes of varying ages starting from  <dig> days to  <dig> years. lowest expression of smoc- <dig> was detected in the blood lymphocytes of animals aged  <dig> days with gradual increase in the expression  from  <dig> month- <dig> months. however, a sharp enhancement in the expression  was detected at the age of 1– <dig>  years and this remained consistent up to the age of  <dig> years and beyond . the dramatic increase in expression of smoc- <dig> at around  <dig> year of age was further confirmed by western blotting using anti-sysmoc1-pab and total protein isolated from blood samples of the same animals .

the comparative expression analysis of the two transcript variants revealed a gradual increase of the variant- <dig> compared to that of variant- <dig> with the progression of age . the expression of variant- <dig> was higher in animal aged up to ~ <dig> months, after which the variant- <dig> expression starts increasing gradually during the ages  <dig> to  <dig> months and remained consistent thereafter.

association of smoc- <dig> with basement membranes
smoc- <dig> was present abundantly in the basement membrane zone of discontinuous endothelial cell layer or the tunica media around the central veins in liver . in addition, smoc- <dig> was found to be ubiquitously distributed in the connective tissues surrounding each lobule and extracellular matrices of space of disse. in testis, smoc- <dig> was abundant in the basement membrane zone surrounding coiled seminiferous tubules below the columnar epididymis and scarcely in the interstitial tissues . smoc- <dig> was localized in the zona pellucida of ovary in buffalo  similar to that in mice. in other tissues also, it remained localized within the basement membrane zones.

discussion
minisatellites have been implicated with gene regulation, chromosomal fragile sites and genome imprinting  <cit>  but biological significance of their association with coding transcripts remains largely unresolved. present study demonstrates the association of the consensus sequence of minisatellite  <dig>  with the coding sequence of the smoc- <dig> transcript  <cit> . however, the existing significance of this association remained unclear.

to date, smoc- <dig> has been characterized only in a few mammals showing variations in domain organization. in other members of sparc family, the fs domain is immediately followed by an ec domain  <cit>  whereas in smoc- <dig>  the fs and ec domains are separated by the two ty domains which are themselves split by the novel smoc- <dig> domain  <cit> , thus maintaining its organizational uniqueness amongst sparc family.

anticipating the roles of orthologues separated millions of years ago has always been a difficult proposition, especially in the context of multidomain proteins with frequent insertions or deletions. thus, biological functions for fs, ty and ec domains in smoc- <dig> are still speculative. the fs domain is not only the characteristic of bm- <dig> family, but also found in other follistatin related genes like c <dig>  c <dig>  agrin, and the transmembrane receptors tmeff <dig> and tmeff <dig>  <cit> . similarly, presence of ty domain in other proteins  <cit>  makes it difficult to ascertain its function in the smoc- <dig>  the ty contain six cysteine residues including a characteristic cwcv tertrapeptide is also conserved in buffalo smoc- <dig>  <cit> . the high content of aromatic amino acids in the unique smoc- <dig> domain entails in formation of a folded domain with a hydrophobic core. presence of two ef hand motifs in ecd of buffalo smoc- <dig> is predicted for its calcium binding affinity as it has been confirmed experimentally using circular dichroism in human smoc- <dig>  <cit> . presence of acidic residues at positions  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig>  and the helix signatures encompassing the calcium binding loops are also conserved for both ef hand domains in buffalo smoc- <dig> 

owing to >90% sequence homology with cattle, human and other species, buffalo smoc- <dig> showed similar arrangement of various domains. analysis of the gene structure in buffalo, human and mouse reveals intactness of each domain border  <cit>  maintaining its reading frame even when some exon/intron is inserted or deleted. however, a number of specific alterations at nucleotide and amino acid levels were found to be unique to buffalo establishing their species specific organization. two types of transcripts have been reported independently in genbank for human and cattle smoc- <dig>  but their detailed characterization was lacking. in this study, we confirmed presence of two variants of this gene varying in their 3'utr lengths. this may either be due to the presence of an alternative splice site within the possible inserted intron  in the 3' region or an alternate splice site in the existing intron  within the 3'utr itself. however, first possibility seems to be invalid since end point pcr conducted with buffalo genomic dna using primers from exon  <dig> and  <dig> gave rise to a single band of the similar size as that with cdna. further, analysis has shown that both the variants have polyadenylation signals followed by poly tail upstream  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides for variants - <dig> & - <dig>  respectively. this is in agreement with the fact that the signals are most often present at 11– <dig> nucleotides upstream from the poly tail  <cit> . however, presence of more copies of mrna instability motifs in variant- <dig>  involved in its degradation  <cit> , compared to that in variant - <dig> supports relatively higher expression of the later.

previous studies have shown that smoc- <dig> mrna is synthesized even during the early stages of mouse embryonic development. during the embryonic stage on day  <dig>  and fetal stages days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the protein is present in the basement membrane zones of various tissues like brain, skin, skeletal muscle, liver, kidney etc  <cit> . but, so far no report is available on the sustenance of expression of smoc- <dig> during life-span of any of the species. our work seems to be the first report showing a remarkable rise in the smoc- <dig> expression during 10– <dig> months of age in buffaloes, followed by constant level maintained throughout the life span. as smoc- <dig> is involved in cell-matrix interaction and bone mineralization, its fulminant expression at  <dig> months and beyond signifies its requirement for growth, development and possible sustenance of the animal.

buffalo smoc- <dig> is a single copy gene, presence of two variants of this gene may signify either for a backup of the transcripts if one is degraded/mutated or for the enhanced protein expression. in earlier studies, smoc- <dig> mrna was reported to be ubiquitously present in all the tissues of mice, showing abundance in ovary but negligible expression in liver and other tissues  <cit> . contrary to this, buffalo liver was enriched with smoc- <dig> transcripts as well as protein whereas other tissues contained fewer or no transcript/protein substantiating species and tissue specificity of this gene. liver is primarily involved in vascular functions, metabolic regulation and secretory and excretory functions. role of the other basement membrane proteins like agrin, collagen iv, laminin and fibronectin in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma has been studied  <cit>  but no report is available on the functional attributes of smoc- <dig> in liver. buffalo may not be prone to hepatocellular carcinoma. however, since smoc- <dig> is conserved across the species, it may not be inappropriate to study the expression of this gene in human hepatocellular carcinoma to ascertain its possible up- or down regulation. owing to its involvement in cell proliferation, adhesion and tissue remodeling, smoc- <dig> may also play a pivotal role in hepatocellular activities.

smoc- <dig> has been localized in zona pellucida and extracellular matrix of mouse ovary. this was suggested to be crucial not only for survival of the oocyte but also for successful fertilization  <cit> . in this study, the smoc- <dig> has been localized to the extracellular matrix and in the epithelial basement membrane zone of buffalo liver. in addition, staining around the seminiferous tubules and sertoli cells of testis substantiated the true basement membrane localization of smoc- <dig> protein because the basal lamina of the seminiferous tubules in bovines is multilayered and possesses knob like protrusions  <cit> .

the liver contains a unique extracellular matrix  within the space of disse, which consists of basement membrane constituents as well as fibrillar ecm molecules. though the basement membranes are mainly formed by a collagen iv, laminin- <dig>  and nidogen- <dig> network  <cit> , the liver derived basement membrane also contains a unique isoform composition of type iv collagen, known to bind with the smoc- <dig> protein  <cit> . thus, smoc- <dig> in ecm of buffalo liver seems to have an undisputed significance. changes in the composition of ecm may be detrimental for the viability of hepatocytes during progression of liver cirrhosis. the role of sparc/osteonectin in human hepatocellular carcinoma has been reported  <cit> . owing to its conservation in human and non-human systems, the fate of smoc- <dig> gene may be studied in human liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and other liver infections to highlight its clinical aspects.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we demonstrated cloning, characterization and expressional analysis of the smoc- <dig> in bubalus bubalis for the first time and unveiled two transcript variants of this gene. both the variants showed difference in their 3' utr length but the deduced amino acid sequences were identical. two ef-hand motifs in the ecd conformed well to its calcium binding affinity and n-glycosylation site at asn- <dig> suggesting its glycoprotein nature. we also detected alterations in smoc- <dig> at nucleotide, amino acid sequences and secondary structure levels amongst different species. buffalo smoc- <dig> transcript variants showed highest expression in liver demonstrating its tissue and species specific functions, in contrast to human and mouse where it expresses to the maximum in the ovary. the study also demonstrated the age specific expression of smoc- <dig> intimating its role in postnatal development besides embryonic development. this study seems to be the first description of two transcript variants and tissue/age specific expression of the smoc- <dig> in any mammalian species highlighting the possibilities of future research on its clinical aspects in the context of human/animal health.
