BACKGROUND
the tea beverage yields many health benefits to humans due to the extensive secondary metabolites in tea leaves, including polyphenols, theanine, and volatile oils  <cit> . the tea plant, camellia sinensis, is both an economically important horticultural crop and a model system for studying self-incompatibility and theaceae plants  <cit> . due to its large genome   <cit>  and lacks of developed genetic tools such as tissue culture and transformation, little genomic information is available. as of august  <dig>  only  <dig> nucleotide sequences,  <dig>  expressed sequence tags ,  <dig> genome survey sequence , and  <dig> proteins from c. sinensis have been deposited in genbank. the bulk of tea research has focused on analysis of secondary metabolism genes, which were mostly discovered through est sequencing. in one study,  <dig> ests derived from a subtractive cdna library were sequenced. approximately  <dig> % of these ests were related to secondary metabolism, including leucoanthocyanidin reductase  involved in catechin synthesis  <cit> . in another study,  <dig> % of the  <dig>  ests in a tender shoot cdna library were related to secondary metabolism, including chalcone isomerase   <cit> . moreover, in a young tea root cdna library constructed in our laboratory,  <dig> % of the  <dig>  valid ests were secondary metabolic genes  <cit> .

est sequencing has long been the core technology for reference transcript discovery  <cit> . however, est sequencing has some inherent limitations, such as low throughput, high cost, and lack of quantitation of the expressed genes. in addition, there is some bias in the composition of cdna libraries caused by bacterial cloning, such as vector contamination, overrepresentation of preferentially cloned sequences, and inadequate representation of rare or inherently unclonable transcripts  <cit> . these inherent limitations of est sequencing and the small number of available ests suggested that our understanding of the tea transcriptome is far from complete.

the cost-effective and ultra-high-throughput dna sequencing technology, rna-seq, is a revolutionary advance in genome-scale sequencing. this transcriptome analysis method is fast and simple because it does not require bacterial cloning of the cdnas. direct sequencing of these cdnas can generate short reads at an extraordinary depth. following sequencing, the resulting reads can be assembled into a genome-scale transcription profile. it is a more comprehensive and efficient way to measure transcriptome composition, obtain rna expression patterns, and discover new exons and genes  <cit> . recent transcriptomic studies on yeast, arabidopsis thaliana, mouse, and human cells have demonstrated that this approach is well-suited for surveying the complexity of transcription in eukaryotes  <cit> . since rna-seq is not limited to detecting transcripts that correspond to existing genomic sequences, it is particularly attractive for non-model organisms with genomic sequences that are yet to be determined  <cit> . in addition, this new approach is very sensitive, allowing detections of low abundant transcripts.

in this report, we took advantage of rna-seq to survey the poly + transcriptome of c. sinensis. the coverage of the transcriptome, at  <dig>  gigabase pairs, was comprehensive enough to discover all known genes of several major metabolic pathways. this transcriptome dataset will serve as a public information platform for gene expression, genomics, and functional genomics in c. sinensis.

RESULTS
sequencing, de novo assembly, and sequence analysis
to comprehensively cover the tea transcriptome, total rna was extracted from seven different tissues: tender shoots, young leaves, mature leaves, stems, young roots, flower buds and immature seeds. equal amounts of total rna from each tissue were pooled together. the poly + rna was isolated, sheered into smaller fragments, and reverse-transcribed to synthesize cdna for illumina ga iix sequencing. a total of  <dig>  million reads  <dig> bp long  were obtained from one plate  in a single sequencing run, generating approximate  <dig>  gigabase pairs  of raw data. an overview of the sequencing and assembly is outlined in table  <dig>  after removal of adaptor sequences, duplication sequences, ambiguous reads and low-quality reads,  <dig>  million high-quality clean reads  remained. the quality of the clean reads data was assessed based on the base-calling quality scores from the illumina's base-caller bustard. eighty-one percent of the clean reads data  has phred-like quality scores at the q <dig> level . all high-quality reads were assembled de novo by soapdenovo program  <cit> , producing  <dig>  contigs longer than  <dig> bp , with an average contig length of  <dig> bp and an n <dig> of  <dig> bp . the size distribution of these contigs is shown in figure 1a. although the majority of the contigs are between  <dig> to  <dig> bp, we obtained  <dig>  contigs which were greater than  <dig> bp in length.

the data from the paired-end sequencing was used to join the contigs into scaffolds, which represent the collections of fragments originating from a single transcript. overall, the contig-joining procedure based on paired-end reads condensed the number of contigs from  <dig>  to  <dig> . among them,  <dig>  contigs  merged into  <dig>  unique scaffolds.

subsequently, gap filling and contig joining were carried out to complete as many scaffolds as possible. through scaffold assembly, an additional  <dig>  mbp were incorporated into existing scaffolds. the amount of all processed data totalled  <dig>  mbp, which further improved the quality of de novo assembly of these short reads.

assembly of transcriptome sequencing reads can produce more scaffolds than expressed genes, reflecting redundancy among the assembled sequences . to reduce any redundancy, assembled sequences from the above analysis were clustered using the gene indices clustering tools  <cit> . sequence clustering merged  <dig>  scaffolds into  <dig> sequence clusters . these sequence clusters had 2- <dig> scaffolds per cluster, and 99% of the clusters contained two scaffolds. the remaining  <dig>  scaffolds were retained as singletons, for a total of  <dig>  "unigenes". this result demonstrated that the assembly and contig joining succeeded in processing a large amount of short reads from the tea plant samples with relatively little redundancy.

out of the  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>  unigenes were ≥ <dig> bp and  <dig>  were ≥ <dig>  bp, with an average unigenes length of  <dig> bp and an n <dig> of  <dig> bp. the size distribution for these unigenes is shown in figure 1b. the unigene distribution followed the contig distribution closely, with the majority being shorter sequences.

to evaluate the quality of the dataset, we analyzed the ratio of the gap's length to the length of assembled unigenes . the majority of the unigenes showed gap lengths that were less than 5% of the total length, which accounted for  <dig> % of total unigenes numbers . in addition, sequencing bias was analyzed by detecting random distribution of reads in assembled unigenes . although the 3' ends of all assembled unigenes contained relatively fewer numbers of reads, other positions of all assembled unigenes showed greater and more even distribution. this observation is consistent with previous publications  <cit> , suggesting that the quality of our dataset was comparable to similar reports in other non-model species.

functional annotation and classification of the c. sinensis transcriptome
annotation of the c. sinensis transcriptome sequences was based on two levels of sequence similarity, namely sequence-based and domain-based alignments. sequence-based alignments were performed against three public databases, including the non-redundant protein database  at ncbi, swiss-prot/uniprot, and the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes database  using blastx algorithm with a significant e-value threshold of 1e- <dig>  domain/family searches contained hidden markov model  domain/family searches in both the interpro and pfam databases and blastx alignments against the clusters of orthologous groups  database at ncbi. the e-value thresholds were also set at ≤1e- <dig>  annotations of the best blastx hits and domain hits are summarized in table  <dig> 

annotation of predicted proteins
for annotations of gene names, coding sequences , and predicted proteins, all assembled sequences were first searched against plant proteins of the nr database, which returned  <dig>  significant blast hits . the length of query sequences was crucial in determining the level of significance of the blast match. as shown in figure 2a, only  <dig> % of the unigenes shorter than  <dig> bp could achieve significant blast scores in the nr database. in contrast, the proportion of unigenes with significant blast scores increased sharply to:  <dig> % for query sequences between  <dig> and  <dig>  bp;  <dig> % for query sequences between  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp;  <dig> % for query sequences between  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp; and  <dig> % for query sequences ≥ <dig>  bp. the result indicates that the proportion of sequences with matches in the nr database is greater among the longer assembled sequences. similar analytical results were obtained using the other five databases . the e-value distribution of the top hits in the nr database showed that  <dig> % of the mapped sequences have strong homology , while the other  <dig> % of the homologous sequences ranged between  <dig> e- <dig> to  <dig> e- <dig> . the similarity distribution showed  <dig> % of the query sequences have a similarity higher than 80%, while  <dig> % of the hits have a similarity ranging from 20% to 80% . homologous genes come from several species, with  <dig> % of the unigenes have the highest homology to genes from vitis vinifera, followed by ricinus communis , populus trichocarpa , arabidopsis thaliana  and glycine max  .

because of the relatively short length of the unigenes  and the lack of c. sinensis genome information, two-thirds of the unigenes did not have a match in the plant protein dataset of nr database. furthermore,  <dig> percent of the above mentioned  <dig>  annotation descriptions were uninformative . the protein dataset of the model dicot plant arabidopsis  and swiss-prot/uniprot database, both of which contain highly annotated protein sequences, were used for additional blast alignments to produce more definitive annotations. as a result, there were  <dig>  and  <dig>  high-score blast matches from the comparisons with arabidopsis and uniprot proteins, respectively . most importantly,  <dig> %  of arabidopsis hits and  <dig> %  of uniprot hits matched genes with known functions . by integration of similarity search results from plant proteins and arabidopsis proteins, a total of  <dig>  unique best blastx matches were produced from nr , and the unigenes obtaining gene descriptions from nr or uniprot amounted to  <dig>  . these detailed annotations were valuable in the assignments of putative functions  to the unigenes.

conserved domain annotation and cog classification
considering that different genes can share certain protein domains, reflecting a level of sequence similarity not accounted for by simple sequence-based alignments, conserved domains in c. sinensis unigenes were further identified against the interpro, pfam and cogs databases. searches against the interpro database  <cit>  revealed  <dig>  top hits categorized into  <dig>  domains/families . most domains were found containing 1- <dig> sequences, with a small proportion appearing more frequently. interpro domains/families were ranked according to the number of c. sinensis unigenes contained in each interpro domain, and the  <dig> most abundant interpro domains/families are represented in table  <dig>  among these protein domains/families, "protein kinase" and its subcategories "serine/threonine-protein kinase" and "tyrosine-protein kinase", known to regulate the majority of cellular pathways, were ranked in the top. moreover, highly represented were "cytochrome p450" and "udp-glucosyltransferase" families, which might contribute to extensive modifications of various secondary compounds, the "wd40-repeat" domain, associated with regulation of signal transduction, transcription and proliferation  <cit> , and the "heat shock protein" family, related to defense mechanisms of thermal stress. in addition,  <dig>  of the assembled unigenes matched entries in the pfam database  <cit> , corresponding to  <dig>  different domains/families . the top  <dig> most frequently detected domains contained "protein kinase," "tyrosine-protein kinase," "pentatricopeptide repeat," "cytochrome p <dig> " "udp-glucosyltransferase," "rna recognition motif," "wd40-repeat," and "reverse transcriptase  " . the top  <dig> pfam results were all in the above mentioned 30-most-abundant interpro domain list.

more specifically, the assembled unigenes were compared against cogs  <cit>  for in-depth analysis of phylogenetically widespread domain families. cogs consist of protein sequences encoded in  <dig> complete genomes, including bacteria, algae and eukaryotes, and were built on classifications according to phylogenetic relationships. each cog consists of individual proteins or groups of paralogs from at least three lineages and thus corresponds to an ancient conserved domain. from c. sinensis unigenes set,  <dig>  of the assembled sequences showing significant homology were assigned to the appropriate cog clusters . because some of these unigenes were annotated with multiple cog functions, altogether  <dig>  functional annotations were produced. these cog classifications were grouped into  <dig> function categories . the five largest categories include 1) "general functions"  associated with basic physiological and metabolic functions; 2) "replication, recombination and repair" ; 3) "transcription" ; 4) "signal transduction mechanisms" ; and 5) "posttranslational modification, protein turnover and chaperones" . the category of secondary metabolism was highlighted with  <dig> % , because of the importance of secondary metabolites to the quality and taste of tea. the most abundant sequences in this category are cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases, with a total of  <dig> unigenes involved in various metabolic pathways. in total,  <dig>  unique domain-based annotations from interpro, pfam and cogs were assigned to c. sinensis unigenes .

gene ontology  classification
to functionally categorize c. sinensis unigenes, gene ontology  terms were assigned to each assembled unigene. go terms are dynamically-structured control vocabulary that can be applied to describe functions of genes and by which genes can be classified into three major categories, namely biological process, molecular function, and cellular component, and their sub-categories  <cit> . out of the  <dig>  most significant blastx hits against the nr plant species dataset, a total of  <dig>  tea unigenes were assigned  <dig>  go term annotations using blast2go  <cit> . these  <dig>  go terms were summarized into the three main go categories and  <dig> sub-categories . cellular component made up the majority of the go annotations , followed by biological process  and molecular function . the major sub-categories are shown in figure 5a: three sub-categories of "cell" , "cell part"  and "organelle"  were in the cluster of cellular component; two sub-categories of "binding functions"  and "catalytic functions"  were in the cluster of molecular function; and six sub-categories of "metabolic process" , "cellular process" , "biological regulation" , "establishment of localization" , "localization" , and "pigmentation"  were in the cluster of biological process. however, this result showed only a small proportion of tea unigenes with go distributions, possibly due to large number of uninformative gene descriptions of these plant protein hits.

the  <dig>  of blastx matches to arabidopsis proteins was used for further go mappings to improve the coverage and depth of go annotation, because the arabidopsis dataset has been extensively annotated with go terms and the most abundant annotation records for c. sinensis unigenes were obtained from the comparisons with arabidopsis proteins. as a result, the number of c. sinensis unigenes assigned with go terms greatly increased to  <dig>  . a total of  <dig>  go terms were associated with these  <dig>  unigenes and classified into  <dig> functional sub-categories . we discovered that the cluster of biological process was dominant , in which the three sub-categories "response to stimulus" , "developmental process" , and "multicellular organismal process"  were included in the top  <dig> abundant sub-groups . the major sub-categories in the clusters of cell component and molecular function were identical to the above mentioned go classification. moreover, only a few genes were assigned with "biological adhesion" , "locomotion" , "viral reproduction"  or "electron carrier"  go terms. out of  <dig> functional sub-categories, unigenes were sorted into the two previously unrepresented sub-categories of "rhythmic process"  and "viral reproduction" , based on arabidopsis go terms. no unigenes were annotated with "virion" , "virion part" , "chemoattractant"  or "chemorepellent"  go terms. as a whole,  <dig>   of the unigenes were associated with at least one go terms between the two kinds of go annotations. these go annotations demonstrate that c. sinensis expressed genes encoding diverse structural, regulatory and stress proteins.

kegg pathway mapping
in order to identify the biological pathways active in c. sinensis, the assembled unigenes were annotated with corresponding enzyme commission  numbers from blastx alignments against the kegg database  <cit> . by mapping ec numbers to the reference canonical pathways, a total of  <dig>  unigenes were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways . the pathways most represented by unique sequences were inositol phosphate metabolism , benzoate degradation via coa ligation , starch and sucrose metabolism  and purine metabolism .

taken together,  <dig>  unique sequence-based annotations had blast scores exceeding our threshold  in nr, uniprot and kegg databases . the venn diagram  shows that an additional  <dig>  unigenes were annotated by domain-based alignments. overall,  <dig>  unique sequence-based or domain-based annotations using the six selected public databases were assigned to c. sinensis unigenes . among them,  <dig>  unigenes had hits in all six public databases with relatively defined functional annotations . these annotations provide a valuable resource for investigating specific processes, structures, functions, and pathways in tea research.

analysis of metabolic pathway genes using c. sinensis unigenes
the  <dig>  annotated unigenes represented a significant expansion of the knowledge contained in existing c. sinensis est libraries. analysis of metabolic pathway genes using c. sinensis unigenes was accomplished as illustrated in figure  <dig>  we selected several primary and secondary metabolic pathways that are related to tea quality for further analysis. for functional annotations, we started with simple keyword searches and confirmed each search result with blast searches. these new genes and their annotations were compared with genes listed in the existing tea uniest database  <cit> .

primary metabolic pathways in c. sinensis
the primary metabolic pathways selected included glycolysis , citrate cycle , pentose phosphate cycle , and calvin cycle and photosynthesis . our dataset includes annotated sequences for all genes in the selected four primary metabolic pathways, except for the glucose-6-phosphatase gene in the calvin cycle . pyruvate kinase of the glycolysis pathway has the greatest number of singletons  matching the description of the gene. the rest of the primary metabolic genes have between  <dig> and  <dig> singletons matching each gene. the genes of the primary metabolic pathways displayed high homology to arabidopsis or other dicot genes, with most of the genes having more than 80% similarity at the protein levels , suggesting that these genes were highly conserved during the evolution.

secondary metabolic pathways in c. sinensis
flavonoid biosynthesis
flavonoids are a class of important secondary metabolites including flavanones, flavones, dihydroflavonols, flavonols, and flavan 3-ols . they are important for tea quality and human health, especially catechins  <cit> . they also play a crucial role in plant defense against pathogens. in tea, flavonoids accumulate to higher levels in young leaves than in mature leaves  <cit> . in our annotated c. sinensis transcriptome dataset, multiple transcripts encoding almost all known enzymes involved in the main flavonoid biosynthesis pathway were identified . unigene ids from the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway are listed in additional file  <dig>  flavonoids are derived from phenylalanine and converted to chalcone via the phenylpropanoid pathway by the enzymes phenylalanine ammonia lyase , cinnamate 4-hydroxylase , 4-coumarate coa ligase , and chalcone synthase . subsequently, chalcone isomerase  catalyzes the stereo-specific cyclization of chalcones into naringenin . naringenin can be converted by flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase  and flavonoid 3', 5'-hydroxylase  to produce eriodictyol  and dihydrotricetin , respectively. naringenin, eriodictyol and dihydrotricetin are the flavanones. almost all flavonoid compounds can be derived from these flavanones. flavone synthase  catalyzes the conversion of flavanones to flavones, but flavanone 3-hydroxylase  can convert these flavanones to dihydroflavonols. following this reaction, the divergent conversions of dihydroflavonols include production of flavonols  and flavan- <dig> -diols  . leucoanthocyanidins are the direct precursors to -flavan 3-ols -catechin, -gallocatechin) produced by leucoanthocyanidin reductase . formation of -epiflavan 3-ols -epicatechin, -epigallocatechin) can be achieved by a two-step reaction on leucoanthocyanidin by anthocyanidin synthase  and anthocyanidin reductase . the above descriptions showed the vertical pathway responsible for the formation and conversion of the sub-categories of flavonoids. it is worth mentioning that flavonoid biosynthesis also includes multiple, parallel sub-pathways, which result from flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase and flavonoid 3', 5'-hydroxylase also accepting the flavones, dihydroflavonols, and flavonols as substrates . therefore, flavonoid biosynthesis looks more like a complex metabolic grid  <cit>  than a linear pathway. since almost all the genes from the flavonoid pathway appeared to have more than one copy in the genome, we suspect c. sinensis encountered genome duplication events during the course of evolution.

some genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway have been reported previously in c. sinensis. some members have been expressed in escherichia coli and were characterized  <cit>  to be involved in catechin biosynthesis. we were able to detect these reported genes in our dataset . surprisingly, some genes associated with isoflavonoid metabolism were also discovered in our transcriptome, including isoflavone reductase  and isoflavone 7-o-methyltransferase . the tea plant is not known to produce isoflavones. similar discoveries have been reported in other non-isoflavone accumulating plants  <cit> , suggesting homologs of isoflavone reductase and isoflavone o-methyltransferase may have general metabolic functions in many plant species.

in addition, new structural genes encoding flavonoid-modifying enzymes were discovered by a sequence or domain search on our dataset against the existing nucleotide and protein sequences of c. sinensis in ncbi or uniprot databases. most of these new genes are involved in glycosylation of flavonoids, catalyzing the transfer of either glucose from udp-glucose or rhamnose from udp-l-rhamnose to the hydroxyl groups of flavonoids . for example, we found unigene sequences encoding tetrahydroxychalcone 2'-glucosyltransferase , flavonol-3-o-glycoside-7-o-glucosyltransferase  <dig> , flavonol 3-o-glucosyltransferase/flavonoid-3-o-glucosyltransferase , anthocyanidin 3-o-glucosyltransferase , anthocyanidin  <dig> -o-glucosyltransferase , flavonol 3-o-glucoside l-rhamnosyltransferase , and flavanone 7-o-glucoside 2''-o-beta-l-rhamnosyltransferase . moreover, unigenes encoding flavonol 3-o-methyltransferase  and flavonol 3-sulfotransferase  were also found in our annotated transcriptome. these genes represent an extensive repertoire of flavonoid modification enzymes that have not been reported before, although some of the conjugated compounds themselves have been identified.

furthermore, a singleton for the flavonoid-related r2r <dig> transcription factor, a myb4a repressor, was found. it is a member of the myb transcription factor family that has been shown to interact with promoters of the phenylpropanoid pathway genes  <cit> .

theanine biosynthesis
theanine is a unique amino acid constituting 1-2% of the dry weight of tea leaf. it is synthesized in roots from glutamic acid and ethylamine by theanine synthetase   <cit> . the substrate ethylamine is derived from decarboxylation of alanine  <cit> . newly synthesized theanine is translocated into the tender shoots through the xylem, where it either accumulates or is broken down into glutamic acid and ethylamine by theanine hydrolase   <cit> . the enzymes involved in theanine synthesis also include glutamine synthetase , glutamate synthase , glutamate dehydrogenase , alanine transaminase , and alanine decarboxylase . most of these theanine pathway genes were found in our dataset, except for aida and thyd, which are specific to tea plants with no orthologs from other species be found in the public databases . the aida sequences here were selected from the homologues of arginine decaboxylase  and s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase , which have similar domains to aida  <cit> . the published ts was highly homologous to gs, thus the identified singletons needs to be confirmed enzymatically. gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase , used to synthesize theanine in bacteria  <cit> , was chosen for a comparative study of the expression abundance in three different organs .

caffeine biosynthesis
caffeine  is a purine alkaloid present in high concentrations in the tea plant. the caffeine biosynthesis pathway  is part of the purine metabolism and is catalyzed by three s-adenosyl-l-methionine-  dependent n-methylation steps, namely xanthosine → 7-methylxanthosine → 7-methylxanthine → theobromine → caffeine. different n-methyltransferases play important roles in the three n-methylation steps  <cit> . all related genes could be found in our transcriptome except the two genes guanosine deaminase  and n-methylnucleosidase  . these two genes have not been cloned previously and thus do not exist in public databases.

orf prediction of selected housekeeping gene
to further confirm our gene prediction and annotation algorithms, six housekeeping gene families were selected for open reading frame  analysis, namely actin, tubulin, histone, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 28s ribosomal protein, phosphofructokinase . out of a total of  <dig> unigene sequences,  <dig> sequences were predicted to contain the complete orf, suggesting that among the house keeping genes,  <dig> % of the genes already have the completed orf. the deduced amino acid sequences have at least 68% homology to arabidopsis or other dicot genes .

comparison of c. sinensis transcriptome with four camellia cdna libraries
previously, we generated four cdna libraries using different tissues of the c. sinensis plant. these tissues included young root, young leaf, subtractive young leaf, and drought-stressed root. the cdnas were sequenced using the conventional sanger sequencing. we compared these four cdna libraries with our illumina sequences using local blastn and tblastx.

first, all est sequences from the four selected camellia cdna libraries were assembled by cap <dig> procedure  <cit>  to obtain  <dig>  uniests in the young root library,  <dig> uniests in the tender shoot library,  <dig> uniests in the young leaves subtractive cdna library, and  <dig> uniests in the drought-stressed root ssh  library of c. sinensis var. assamica. we found that less than 5% of the unigenes from the illumina transcriptome dataset have significant homology to the four uniest databases at the nucleotide level, and less than 10% at the amino acid level. the alignment of c. sinensis transcriptome against the young root cdna library produced the maximum number of best hits . these significant hits covered 75~85% of uniests in the four cdna libraries . in addition, unigenes in the c. sinensis transcriptome were further classified into four groups by sequence length, and each group was also aligned against the four uniest databases. as expected, longer sequences produced more significant blast hits . these results indicated that our transcriptome data have a high degree of consistency with previous est data, yet also represent a significant increase in coverage.

gene validation and expression analysis
to experimentally confirm that the unigenes obtained from sequencing and computational analysis were indeed expressed,  <dig> unigenes related to theanine and flavonoid synthesis were chosen for rt-pcr and qrt-pcr analysis .

in the rt-pcr analysis, every selected unigene was pcr positive with a single band at the calculated size . in the qrt-pcr analysis, relative transcript levels of the unigenes from three different organs were further compared. in the theanine pathway, tea homologues of gdh <dig>  gs1- <dig> and adc were expressed much higher in young roots than in leaves and stems , with the lowest expression level in the stems. in comparison, the expression levels of gs1- <dig>  ggt, glutamate synthase  and samdc were low in young roots, and high in young shoots. the results confirmed that the expression of these selected genes directly correlated with theanine metabolism.

in the flavonoid pathway, six selected unigenes have differential expression patterns . overall expression levels of pal, 4cl, dfr and fnsii were higher than those of chs and lcr. the tea homologues of dfr and pal were highly expressed in young roots; 4cl expression levels in roots were similar to those in stems. in contrast, the expression levels of fnsii, chs and lcr in leaves were higher than those in roots. the results of qrt-pcr expression analysis matched the putative functions of these unigenes.

discussion
ultra-high-throughput mrna sequencing technology is a fast, efficient, and cost-effective way to characterize the poly + transcriptome. it is especially suitable for gene expression profiling in non-model organisms that lack genomic sequences. to date, most sequencing efforts in c. sinensis were based on est sequencing, with a limited number of tags reported in public databases. in this study, we applied rna-seq technology for c. sinensis transcriptome profiling, in which the poly + transcriptome was sequenced on the illumina ga iix platform. we obtained  <dig>  g bp coverage with  <dig>  million high-quality reads. we generated a total of  <dig>  unigenes  by de novo assembly. among them,  <dig>  assembled unigenes were annotated. our coverage is approximately 10-fold more than all c. sinensis sequences deposited in genbank combined .

since c. sinensis is self-incompatible and recalcitrant to genetic manipulations, little genetic or genomic information is currently available. therefore, instead of a comprehensive in-depth investigation of the tea transcriptome, our experiment was designed to generate a quick landscape view. a number of strategies were adopted to obtain sufficient coverage of expressed transcripts, to improve the accuracy of de novo assembly, and to increase the effectiveness of the gene annotations. first, experimental materials for rna preparation came from seven organs of the tea plant, which were selected to acquire as comprehensive coverage as possible. second, an illumina library was constructed based on the fragmenting rna method, which has been shown both to reduce the amount of rna secondary structure and 5' bias and to have better overall uniformity  <cit> . third, a paired-end library sequencing strategy was applied not only to increase the sequencing depth, but also to improve the efficiency of de novo assembly. finally, all six public databases were selected for gene annotation comparisons in order to acquire complete functional information.

as a result,  <dig>  unigenes  returned significant hits from blast comparisons with the six public databases. these unigenes were assigned not only gene or protein name descriptions, but also putative conserved domains, gene ontology terms and metabolic pathways. detailed functional information is important to understand overall expression profiles of c. sinensis. in particular, the number of unigenes that hit all six public databases summed up to  <dig> . because these genes had relatively unambiguous annotation, they were selected for tea-specific pathway analyses. the remaining  <dig>  unigenes  did not generate significant homology to existing genes. the absence of homology could be caused by several factors. obviously, a large proportion  of unigenes was shorter than  <dig> bp, some of which were too short to allow statistically meaningful matches. however, for some unigenes, the absence of homologous sequences in the public databases may indicate specific roles for them in c. sinensis. we are currently cataloging the longer unigenes  in tea plants.

the annotated unigenes were used to study primary and secondary metabolic pathways. for the four primary metabolic pathways investigated, all essential structural genes were found . the putative pathway genes from tea were highly similar to those from the model dicot plant arabidopsis or other dicot plants. we also analyzed six families of house-keeping genes to evaluate the completeness of our transcriptome coverage. more than  <dig> % of these high copy number genes had full-length orfs. we believe future large-scale sequencing efforts on tea genome and transcriptome will increase the coverage of our dataset even further.

the quality of tea in large part depends on its metabolic profiles. we focused on flavonoids, theanine and caffeine biosynthesis for additional analyses. we were able to find almost all metabolic genes from these pathways . many of these genes appeared to form multi-gene families. it implies that the tea genome, like many other higher plants, went through one or more round of genome duplications during evolution. c. sinensis has a diploid genome, thus, extensive genome re-arrangement might have occurred. we are interested in using snps analysis to better understand the genome structure when more rna-seq data has been obtained.

a few genes are currently missing in these pathways, which might be due to their low expression, insufficient sampling, or ineffective annotations. some of these genes, such as guanosine deaminase and n-methylnucleosidase, have not been reported in plants before. on the other hand, we found some genes that might play important roles in the above mentioned pathways. for example, many glycosylation enzymes and cytochrome p <dig> genes were discovered in the transcriptome, which might contribute to the extensive modifications of various secondary compounds found in tea leaf extracts.

by comparing our transcriptome data with four previously prepared cdna libraries analyzed by est sequencing, we showed that the number of unigenes from rna-seq was approximate  <dig> times more than the existing cdna libraries. yet, a small number of genes discovered in the cdna libraries did not generate blast hits in the illumina transcriptome, which could be resolved by increasing the sequencing depth, enhancing the accuracy of the assembly, and perfecting gene annotation strategies. we have selected two sets of structural enzymes to validate our gene annotations. each one of them generated the expected band size by rt-pcr, and qrt-pcr analysis showed consistent expression patterns. we are confident that our transcriptome dataset is a valuable addition to the publicly available tea genomic information.

CONCLUSIONS
using illumina sequencing technology, we surveyed the poly + transcriptome of c. sinensis at an unprecedented depth  and produced  <dig>  assembled unigenes with  <dig>  unigenes obtaining annotation. to our knowledge, our results represent approximately 10-fold more genes than all c. sinensis genes deposited in genbank  and approximate  <dig> times more than the existing c. sinensis cdna libraries. this study demonstrated that the illumina sequencing technology could be applied as a rapid and cost-effective method for de novo transcriptome analysis of non-model plant organisms without prior genome annotation. these findings provided a comprehensive enough coverage to discover almost all known genes of several major metabolic pathways, which also serves as a substantial contribution to existing sequence resources for the tea plant. we believe that this transcriptome dataset will serve as an important public information platform to accelerate research of gene expression, genomics, and functional genomics in c. sinensis.
