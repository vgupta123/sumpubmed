BACKGROUND
yersinia pestis is a gram-negative bacterium within the family enterobacteriaceae that, along with yersinia pseudotuberculosis and yersinia enterocolitica, is one of three members of its genus that can cause disease in humans. y. pestis diverged from y. pseudotuberculosis only  <dig>  -  <dig>  years ago, but y. pestis and y. pseudotuberculosis diverged from y. enterocolitica in the more distant past  <cit> . despite their close evolutionary relationship, the diseases they cause differ markedly. whereas y. pseudotuberculosis and y. enterocolitica are primarily gastrointestinal pathogens in humans, y. pestis infections lead to a systemic disease known as plague that can become fatal rapidly. in the last  <dig> years, there have been three distinct outbreaks of plague that have led to a large number of fatalities: the justinian plague between the 5th and 7th centuries, the black death in europe between the 13th and 15th centuries, and the modern plague from the latter half of the 1800s to the present. these outbreaks of fatal infections that continue to occur  <cit> , the recent isolation of a multi-drug resistant strain  <cit> , and the potential to develop into a bioweapon all signify that y. pestis remains a significant threat to human health.

most y. pestis strains can be divided into three biovars: antigua, mediavalis, and orientalis, based on their ability to ferment glycerol and reduce nitrate  <cit> . biovar antigua strains can do both; biovar mediavalis strains can ferment glycerol but cannot reduce nitrate; and biovar orientalis strains cannot ferment glycerol but can reduce nitrate  <cit> . moreover, each biovar has been linked to one of the three pandemics. biovar antigua is associated with the justinian plague; biovar mediavalis is associated with the black death; and biovar orientalis is associated with modern plague  <cit> . debate surrounding these associations continues, however, as recent data suggest that the black death might not have been caused by strains belonging to biovar mediavalis but rather by at least two strains that pre-date the emergence of and are distinct from both biovar mediavalis and biovar orientalis  <cit> .

here we present a metabolic network reconstruction and corresponding mathematical model of metabolism in y. pestis co <dig> . this strain is classified within biovar orientalis and is virulent to humans, a feature which distinguishes the model presented here from one published previously for y. pestis  <dig>  <cit> , which is avirulent to humans. we also present a comprehensive analysis of pathways in the metabolic network related to the biosynthesis and utilization of key metabolites, acquire experimental data from growth on several different carbon sources and compare them to simulation results, and identify essential genes that might constitute possible targets for antibiotic development.

RESULTS
characteristics of the reconstruction
the y. pestis co <dig> metabolic reconstruction presented here, ipc <dig>  contains  <dig> genes,  <dig> proteins,  <dig> unique metabolites, and  <dig> reactions. ipc <dig> was assembled by comparison to existing e. coli  <cit> , salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium   <cit> , and y. pestis strain  <dig>  <cit>  metabolic reconstructions; genetic, protein, metabolite, and biochemical data contained in databases such as kegg  <cit> , brenda  <cit> , metacyc  <cit> , and patric  <cit> ; and genus-, species-, and strain-specific information gleaned from the literature. the model contains distinct compartments for the cytoplasm and periplasm, and inner and outer membrane transporters and their associated transport reactions model the movement of metabolites between the compartments. of the  <dig> reactions,  <dig>  are linked to their corresponding genes and proteins through gene-protein-reaction associations ; the majority of the  <dig> non-linked reactions are transport reactions. table  <dig> summarizes the general features of ipc <dig>  while figure  <dig> depicts the functional classification of the  <dig> genes according to their cog function and presents a comparison to the e. coli, s. typhimurium lt <dig>  and y. pestis  <dig> metabolic reconstructions. the full list of all genes, metabolites, reactions, and gprs in ipc <dig> can be found in additional file  <dig> 

to compile the number of unique metabolites, identical compounds appearing in more than one compartment were only counted once. unique metabolic reactions encompass all reactions except exchange reactions and biomass objective functions.

the ipc <dig> model contains two biomass objective functions   <cit>  that were derived from the two bofs developed for the existing y. pestis  <dig> reconstruction  <cit>  and modified as follows. first, ipc <dig> contains pathways for the biosynthesis of four y. pestis fatty acid acyl chains that are not explicitly modeled in the y. pestis  <dig> reconstruction, specifically 14: <dig>  16: <dig>  16: <dig>  and 18: <dig>  these four comprise approximately 86% of the total fatty acid composition in  <dig> y. pestis isolates during growth at 28°c  <cit> . second, the lipopolysaccharide  core oligosaccharide contains an uncommon d-glycero-d-talo-oct-2-ulosonic acid  analog not normally found in gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . both of these features have been incorporated into the two bofs in ipc <dig> 

two bofs are needed because the y. pestis biomass composition differs at 25-28°c versus 37°c. the significance of these two temperatures stems from the two types of hosts that y. pestis infects in the natural environment: insect vectors at ambient temperature and mammalian hosts with regulated body temperatures of about 37°c. accordingly, most laboratory studies of y. pestis are carried out at one or both of these temperatures, and data from such studies have revealed two principal differences in biomass composition at 25-28°c versus 37°c. the first involves the lipopolysaccharide  structure: at 37°c the lps is composed of one predominant core oligosaccharide and one predominant lipid a isoform , whereas at 25°c the lps is composed of multiple structures for both  <cit> . the second involves the fatty acid composition. lipid measurements from y. enterocolitica indicate that the abundance of various fatty acids varies with growth temperature  <cit> , and we assume that this characteristic holds for y. pestis as well. the coefficients of the terms representing the four fatty acids consequently differ between the two bofs. the 25-28°c bof covers a temperature range rather than a single value since the experimental data on which this bof was constructed were taken over this range. thus, the model also assumes that the bof composition does not change appreciably between 25°c and 28°c.

gap analysis of biosynthetic pathways
there were a number of gaps in ipc <dig> that initially prevented the simulation of biomass formation. these gaps consisted of reactions that were essential for simulating growth but for which we could not identify homologs in yp co <dig> to the gene products in e. coli, s. typhimurium, or y. pestis  <dig> that catalyze the same reactions. each of these gaps constitutes testable experimental hypotheses.

one gap occurs in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway . the current annotation of the yp co <dig> genome indicates that this strain contains the same full suite of genes for fatty acid biosynthesis that e. coli and s. typhimurium have except one, the enoyl acyl-carrier protein  reductase fabi. the enzyme encoded by fabi catalyzes the reduction of the  <dig>  double bond in diverse acyl units during chain elongation  <cit> , which is an essential step in fatty acid biosynthesis. consistent with this data, the model cannot simulate growth without this key enzyme. we have therefore included this reaction in the model but it is not associated with a gene or protein.

a similar gap appears in the lysine biosynthesis pathway. lysine is synthesized from aspartate in both e. coli and s. typhimurium through a series of nine enzyme-catalyzed reactions  <cit> , and yp co <dig> has homologs to each of the nine enzymes except one, argd  . in yp co <dig>  an is element  is inserted directly into the orf of ypo <dig>  <cit> , splitting it into two and likely rendering it nonfunctional. despite this disruption, we experimentally tested and found no evidence for lysine auxotrophy in yp co <dig>  a phenotypic observation that suggests additional enzyme can catalyze the same reaction as ypo <dig> during lysine biosynthesis. we consequently searched for alternative enzymes within the yp co <dig> genome that can accept both n-succinyl-l-2-amino-6-oxopimelate and any molecule capable of donating an amino group as reactants , but found no support for such an enzyme. subsequently, we searched for paralogs within the yp co <dig> genome that have homology to both ypo <dig> fragments. the gene with the greatest homology was ypo <dig> with 59% nucleotide identity, and we have assumed in the model that ypo <dig> can replace ypo <dig> in the lysine biosynthetic pathway .

phenotype simulations
once all critical gaps necessary for in silico biomass formation were filled, we deployed the model to compute growth versus no-growth on different carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur sources at both 25-28°c and 37°c . we focused particular attention on rhamnose and melibiose since the ability or inability to ferment these two sugars is one of several phenotypes commonly used to classify different strains of y. pestis. for example, two of the best predictors for virulence in humans are the absence of rhamnose fermentation and virulence in guinea pigs  <cit> . yp co <dig> is known to be lethal to humans, and consistent with this phenotype there is no growth in silico if rhamnose is the sole carbon source. the model predicts that this outcome is due to the overaccumulation of l-lactaldehyde. specifically, the uptake pathway that connects periplasmic rhamnose with central metabolism  leads to the synthesis of a byproduct, l-lactaldehyde, that is not removed through secretion, degradation, incorporation into metabolism, or by any other means. its production via this pathway would therefore result in an infinite accumulation of the compound, which is a thermodynamically impossible outcome. on the other hand, the melibiose utilization pathway appears to be intact and thermodynamically consistent. we assume that a general outer membrane porin allows passage of melibiose from the extracellular space into the periplasm, after which an inner membrane sodium:galactoside symporter  appears capable of transporting melibiose into the cytosol. subsequently, the alpha-galactosidase rafa   <cit>  connects imported melibiose with central metabolism . this analysis implies that regulation of these genes in the melibiose utilization pathway, rather than the genes themselves, underlies the inability of yp co <dig> to utilize melibiose. we accounted for this observation by retaining this set of reactions in the model but deactivating the melibiose extracellular to periplasm uptake reaction.

using the individual components of the bcs chemical medium to constrain the model  <cit> , we next assessed whether the model could recapitulate common amino acid auxotrophies seen in epidemic strains of y. pestis such as co <dig>  these are methionine, phenylalanine, and the combination of glycine and threonine  <cit> . consistent with these data, the model exhibits auxotrophy for methionine and phenylalanine but growth still occurs at a slow rate  in silico in the absence of both glycine and threonine as long as all other amino acid components in the bcs medium are present. prior experimental studies have reported the isolation of y. pestis clones that grow in media lacking the two amino acids after several days incubation and attributed the mechanism to meiotrophy  <cit> . we observed identical behavior when we experimentally tested for glycine/threonine auxotrophy in yp co92: we could detect growth one day after inoculating it into media supplemented with threonine, but glycine/threonine-deficient media did not support growth until several days after inoculation. simulation results, however, suggest that slow growth rather than meiotrophy might be sufficient to explain the glycine/threonine phenotype. the model does not exhibit any other amino acid auxotrophy.

to further evaluate the performance of the model against experimental data, we tested whether yp co <dig> could grow on eleven different carbon sources and compared the data against simulation results. initially, model simulations correctly reproduced the experimental data for ten of the eleven compounds . glycerol was the only exception: the simulations originally permitted growth on glycerol but no growth was seen when yp co <dig> was cultured in media containing glycerol as the principal carbon source, a result that is consistent with prior studies of yp co <dig>  <cit> . it has been proposed that a  <dig> bp deletion in glpd , which encodes aerobic glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, might render the protein nonfunctional and account for this growth phenotype  <cit> . there is a second glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the yp co <dig> genome, gpsa ; however, the gpsa homolog in e. coli only catalyzes the unidirectional conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glycerol 3-phosphate . the protein cannot catalyze the reverse reaction, which is the necessary direction for glycerol assimilation  <cit> . these data were subsequently incorporated into the model to make it more consistent with the observed glycerol-negative phenotype, but slow growth  still occurs in silico despite these modifications because the model permits glycerol to enter central metabolism indirectly through the fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation pathways. although not tested here, lactose represents another discrepancy between model simulations and experimental data . none of the three pathogenic yersiniae can metabolize lactose, but model simulations erroneously suggest that yp co <dig> can.

values in parentheses in the experimental column are the measured growth rates performed as part of this study. values in parentheses in the computational column indicate model-predicted growth rates in bcs defined media with or without citrate and with glucose or gluconate as the principal carbon source.

for two of the eleven compounds , we also measured the uptake and secretion rates for a set of metabolites during growth at 26°c, constrained the model according to the data , and assessed the ability of the constrained model to accurately compute growth rates on the two carbon sources. both growth media contained citrate in addition to the two carbon sources; citrate is a common component of the bcs medium routinely used to culture yersinia spp  <cit> . the simulated and experimental growth rates agreed well on both sugars  regardless of the presence or absence of citrate in the simulation, which suggests that yp co <dig> utilizes negligible amounts of citrate when either glucose or gluconate are present.

gene essentiality
we used the reconstruction to predict essential metabolic genes in yp co <dig> for growth on the same glucose and gluconate defined media we used to culture the bacterium . in total,  <dig> identical genes are predicted to be essential on both media and at both growth temperatures. an additional three genes, ypo <dig>  ypo <dig>  and ypo <dig>  are predicted to be essential at 25-28°c only. these three genes are involved in the biosynthesis of two forms of lipid a that are present only at 25-28°c  <cit> . a fourth gene, ypo <dig> , is predicted to be essential on gluconate only because its deletion disrupts gluconeogenesis and consequently the biosynthesis of glycogen, an indispensable component of the yp co <dig> biomass objective function. the full list of genes predicted to be essential on the two media can be found in additional file  <dig> 

the largest group of predicted essential genes falls within amino acid transport and metabolism . removal of genes in this subset imitates one of the three amino acid auxotrophies that characterize this strain. the next largest groups are nucleotide and coenzyme metabolism  followed by cell membrane biogenesis  and lipid metabolism ; however, many genes in these groups were also deemed to be essential according to the e. coli and s. typhimurium metabolic reconstructions on which many of the gene-protein-reactions in ipc <dig> are based  <cit>  . this set of predicted essential genes therefore reflects probable overlap among the three models. in turn, the overlap arises from what is likely common biology that is shared within the family of enterobacteriaceae. it might be possible to exploit this feature for the development of broad-spectrum antibiotics targeted against this group of human pathogens.

discussion
metabolic reconstructions constitute a framework to organize genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and other data sets and to assess the effects of perturbations on these elements at the network level. accordingly, we present a metabolic reconstruction for yp co <dig>  a strain that is virulent to humans, and benchmark the reconstruction qualitatively against experimental growth data from eleven different carbon sources and quantitatively against growth rate and metabolite uptake and secretion rate data from two of the sources.

the two gaps in lysine and fatty acid biosynthesis highlighted in this work are significant because model simulations cannot occur unless both gaps are filled. the gap in lysine biosynthesis is noteworthy in that the disrupted gene, ypo <dig>  encodes a bifunctional enzyme, argd, that is involved in arginine biosynthesis as well  <cit> : specifically, argd catalyzes the reversible conversion of n-acetyl-l-glutamate 5-semialdehyde and l-glutamate to n-acetyl-l-ornithine and 2-oxoglutarate, after which n-acetyl-l-ornithine is converted to l-ornithine. an absence of argd does not result in arginine auxotrophy, however, because yp co <dig> contains an alternative, one-step route to l-ornithine from l-proline that is catalyzed by ypo <dig>  this reaction is included in the model. on the other hand, there is no clear paralog or other mechanism within yp co <dig> that appears capable of replacing the missing fabi gene in fatty acid biosynthesis. at the amino acid level, there is only 28% identity between e. coli fabi and its best match in yp co <dig>  ypo <dig>  we therefore sought to identify possible candidate enzymes through an analysis of expression data for yp co <dig> , reasoning that the unidentified gene will be located near other genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis  through ypo <dig> ), show correlated expression with the genes in this cluster, and be annotated as hypothetical. the best match based on these criteria is the hypothetical gene ypo <dig>  consequently, we propose that ypo <dig> might possess the ability to carry out the same catalytic function as fabi. other genes showing correlated expression but located farther away from ypo1597-ypo <dig> are ypo <dig> and ypo <dig> 

pathway analysis and model simulations led to the hypothesis that yp co <dig> cannot utilize rhamnose and melibiose due to a missing sink reaction and perturbed gene regulation, respectively, but other possible mechanisms have been advanced. a disruption in gene regulation might contribute to the rhamnose-negative phenotype as well. specifically, a recent study that compared the sequences of rhamnose fermentation genes in rhamnose-positive and rhamnose-negative strains suggested that a point mutation in the transcriptional activator rhas might be responsible for the rhamnose-negative phenotype  <cit> . experimental data from a prior study indirectly support this claim  <cit> . rhamnose-negative strains can revert and gain the ability to metabolize the sugar at a low frequency, and an analysis of one such strain found that rhab and rhaa had become active in the revertant  <cit> . since rhas regulates the rhabad operon  <cit> , these data imply that rhas is the key regulatory protein controlling rhamnose utilization and that the mechanism involves rhabad. on the other hand, melibiose metabolism might be absent in yp co <dig> because of one or more defects in inner membrane transport. we identified two possible melibiose symporters in yp co <dig>  ypo <dig> and ypo <dig> . the former is the homolog of the putative melibiose symporter yp <dig> from y. pestis  <dig>  a strain that can utilize melibiose  <cit> , but the 5' end of the coding sequence for ypo <dig> has been disrupted by the is element is <dig>  ypo <dig> is therefore presumed to be a pseudogene. the latter is intact in yp co92; however, the is element is <dig> is located approximately  <dig> bp upstream from the 5' end of melb, raising the possibility that it has potentially disrupted the control of expression of melb. proteomic data collected during mid-log growth on bcs medium support this hypothesis: no peptides for ypo <dig> could be detected under these growth conditions .

like rhamnose and melibiose, several hypotheses have been advanced to explain why yp co <dig> cannot metabolize glycerol. analysis of the yp co <dig> genome sequence revealed the presence of a  <dig> bp in-frame deletion in glpd that might account for this phenotype: glpd encodes aerobic glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme that is essential for glycerol utilization  <cit> , and this deletion likely disrupts protein function. intriguingly, this same deletion appeared in every glycerol-negative strain in one culture collection whereas all glycerol-positive strains from the same collection contained an intact glpd  <cit> . there is a second annotated glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase within the yp co <dig> genome, gpsa, but the gpsa homolog in e. coli can only catalyze the transformation from dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glycerol 3-phosphate in an irreversible manner . a second defect occurs in the glpfkx operon and might contribute to the glycerol-negative phenotype as well: both the hypothetical protein glpx  and, more importantly, the glycerol kinase glpk  have also been disrupted by large deletions and are presumed to be pseudogenes. as with glpd, there is a second annotated glycerol kinase in the yp co <dig> genome, ypo <dig>  but it is unknown whether ypo <dig> can duplicate the function of ypo <dig> 

we saw slow growth for yp co <dig> in both experimental measurements and model simulations in the absence of glycine and threonine, and the model predicts that this phenotype stems from insufficient supply of nitrogen. bcs medium does not contain an explicit source of nitrogen such as nh4cl; therefore, yp co <dig> most likely obtains elemental nitrogen through catabolism of one or more amino acids. glycine, threonine, and serine can all interconvert. in turn, the breakdown of l-serine by l-serine dehydratase  or l-threonine by l-threonine dehydratase  leads to the direct formation of nh <dig>  simulations that exclude glycine and threonine from the in silico growth medium  force nitrogen acquisition to occur through multi-step pathways that are less efficient, leading to slower growth. providing supplemental nitrogen through sources such as nh4cl, in contrast, leads to a faster in silico growth rate that varies with the uptake rate of the supplemental source.

it is well known that certain y. pestis strains such as co <dig> display methionine auxotrophy  <cit> , and the model highlights the importance of the methionine salvage pathway to this phenotype. several reactions in this pathway are not currently associated with any genes in yp co92; however, if this pathway is absent, the byproduct s-methyl-5'-thioadenosine  would be generated during reactions that consume s-adenosyl methionine, but mta itself would never be consumed or degraded in any reaction. such a situation is identical to the formation of l-lactaldehyde during rhamnose utilization and results in the same thermodynamically impossible outcome. furthermore, this pathway is fully annotated in other y. pestis strains such as pestoides f and angola, suggesting that it is present in yp co <dig> as well but that the associated genes remain to be identified. for these reasons, the model includes a set of non-gene-associated reactions that recycles mta back into methionine via the methionine salvage pathway, and predicts that these reactions are essential in yp co <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the analyses presented here concerning lysine, fatty acid, amino acid, rhamnose, melibiose, and glycerol metabolism help to illustrate how flux-balance analysis  of well-curated metabolic models can provide a context for interpreting experimental data. the crucial information provided by fba is pathway utilization: whereas visual inspection of static pathway diagrams alone can indicate whether a certain pathway is present or absent in an organism, visual inspection cannot indicate whether a certain pathway carries flux and is therefore utilized. in contrast, fba can provide this insight. for example, yp co <dig> appears to have the ability to metabolize rhamnose because a complete set of genes and reactions connects imported rhamnose to central metabolism, but fba analysis suggests that the absence of l-lactaldehyde degradation prevents this pathway from being utilized. similarly, the gaps in lysine and fatty acid biosynthesis are readily apparent when genome annotation data is overlaid on static diagrams for the two pathways, but the model highlights the importance of these gaps - that they are essential reactions - since growth simulations cannot take place unless the gaps are filled. looking forward, we anticipate that this reconstruction will serve as a platform with which to reconstruct the metabolism of other strains within the yersinia genus and to integrate and interrogate -omics data sets generated for these organisms. integrated models for other pathogens have already provided insight into important phenomena such as drug-target networks  <cit>  and host-pathogen interactions  <cit> . similar efforts for yp co <dig> would further underscore the value that metabolic models bring to the interpretation of experimental data and likely generate additional important and testable hypotheses for this dangerous human pathogen.
