BACKGROUND
vietnam is a tropical country in southeast asia with a rice-based agricultural economy. rice is grown on 82 % of the agricultural area, which corresponds to  <dig>  m ha for a production of  <dig>  million tons in  <dig>  <cit> . vietnam is the world’s second rice exporter . rice is mainly grown under irrigated conditions in the river deltas, notably the mekong delta in south vietnam  and the red river delta in north vietnam ; however, because three-quarters of vietnam’s territory is made up of mountainous and hilly regions, other ecosystems are also represented .

vietnam is among countries most threatened by climate change  <cit> . in particular, between spring and summer, all of the central areas of vietnam are subject to periods of recurrent and severe drought that affect rice plantlets just after planting or plants during grain filling and can result in important yield losses. to improve rice drought resistance, an ideotype with a large number of deep and thick roots and a high root-to-shoot ratio was advocated, assuming that there was water at depth in the soil profile  <cit> . however, because roots develop underground and are not easily observed, this ideotype is difficult to select for. one way to achieve this goal would be to use indirect selection based on markers that are tightly linked to genes that control these root traits  <cit> . knowledge of the genetic control of root development in rice is rapidly improving. numerous root quantitative trait loci  have been detected in various mapping populations . three qtls that are involved in water and nutrient uptake by roots have recently been cloned . furthermore, other qtls have been finely mapped, and the underlying genes are close to being identified  <cit> . the rice orthologs of several genes that were initially identified in arabidopsis have also been shown to have an effect on root development in rice . however, this useful information is still far from giving a clear overall pattern of the network of genes that are involved. genome-wide association studies  are a way to directly identify new candidate genes or, more reasonably, to narrow down the chromosomal segments that carry functional factors to much smaller intervals  <cit> . because of the lower linkage disequilibrium  that is encountered in natural populations, the resolution of qtl detection in such populations is higher than that obtained by classical mapping populations of the same size. however, the corollary of this low ld is that the average distance between the markers that are used to genotype the population needs to be shorter than the ld decay distance to properly cover the whole genome. such high marker density has only become accessible, in most species, with the development of new sequencing technologies, notably genotyping by sequencing . genotyped panels representing a broad geographic diversity have been developed  <cit>  and used in gwas for root traits  <cit> . however, although their size is on the order of  <dig> to  <dig> accessions, these panels still explore only a small fraction of the large rice diversity. accessions from vietnam are not widely represented in world-wide panels although local genetic resources, notably from geographically diverse countries, have been shown to bear unexploited but interesting variations for useful traits  <cit> . even among the  <dig> rice genomes that were recently sequenced, only  <dig> vietnamese accessions were included  <cit> . to take advantage of the allelic richness that can be encountered locally, we have developed a panel that is exclusively composed of accessions from vietnam . this panel of  <dig> accessions has been genotyped with approximately  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  using gbs, and its structure and the decay of ld have been analyzed in depth  <cit> . the panel is composed of two-thirds indica, one-third japonica and a few admixed accessions. several subpopulations  were detected within each subpanel. the average distances between polymorphic markers are 18 kb, 28 kb and 44 kb, for the whole panel, the indica and the japonica subpanels, respectively. on average, the pairwise ld, measured by r <dig>  reaches  <dig>  and  <dig>  at 25 kb in the indica and japonica subpanels, respectively, and decays faster to background levels in the indica subpanel  than in the japonica subpanel . because the distance between markers is shorter than the ld decay, the marker coverage is sufficient to undertake gwas in all panels. because the accessions came from different ecosystems, ranging from upland to mangrove, that were subject to specific but severe stresses , this panel constitutes an excellent resource for studying the genetic control of root system architecture and abiotic stress resistance.

in this paper, we performed an association study on root traits using our panel of vietnamese varieties. using a soil column system, different root parameters  were investigated. several qtls were detected in the indica and japonica subpanels or in the whole panel. among these qtls, one associated with crown root thickness on chromosome  <dig> and one associated with crown root number on chromosome  <dig> had the highest levels of significance.

RESULTS
phenotyping
the results of the analysis of variance  are presented in table  <dig>  the variety effect was highly significant for all of the traits. the broad-sense heritability of the traits, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , was moderate to high, with the exception of two related traits  and maximum root length ) for which values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, were registered. the replication effect was often significant, and the block effect was almost always highly significant, indicating some internal heterogeneity within replicates that the design helped to control. this environmental heterogeneity may be due to slight differences in light intensity due to the shade from neighbor trees and to the disposition of the blocks in the screenhouse, some peripheral, some central. the accession means were therefore adjusted from block effects. the mean, standard deviation, range and coefficient of variation  of the whole panel are presented in additional file 2: table s <dig>  a graphical representation of the plant architecture of each accession is shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  a moderate to large variation was observed for most of the traits, as seen through the cvs of the panel varying from 20 % to 63 %, with the exception of longest leaf length , depth, mrl, root thickness  and shallow root proportion  whose cvs were less than 20 %. the same elements for the indica and japonica subpanels are presented in table  <dig>  for most of the shoot and root biomass traits, including deep root traits , mrl, root mass in the 00–20 cm segment , root mass in the 20–40 cm segment , root mass in the 40–60 cm segment , root mass below 60 cm , root dry weight , deep root mass  weight  and plant dry weight ), the mean values of the indica accessions were higher than those of the japonica accessions. the indica accessions had on average a much larger biomass, shorter leaves, more tillers and many more crown roots but had thinner roots and fewer resources allocated to roots, notably to deep roots  and slightly lower deep root proportion  ). however, the trait distributions  showed that the range of variation of the indica and japonica accessions was largely overlapping. to confirm these results and assess to what extent the observed phenotypic variability was determined by the genetic structure, a mean comparison was conducted between groups within the whole panel and between subpopulations within each subpanel for the genotyped accessions . for the majority of the traits except for depth, mrl, dwb <dig>  srp, drp and r_s, the phenotypic differences between the indica and japonica subpanels within the whole panel were highly significant. there were also difference between subpopulations within each subpanel for most of the traits except for depth for the indica subpanel, number of tillers , sdw, number of crown root per tiller  and pdw for the japonica subpanel and dw <dig> for both subpanels. the percentage of phenotypic variance that was explained by the panel structure, which provides an alternate estimate of the relationships between genetic structure and phenotype for a given trait, gave similar results, with high percentages generally associated with the highest within-subpanel phenotypic differentiation . the mean comparisons showed that subpopulations i <dig> and, to a lesser extent, i <dig> in the indica subpanel and subpopulations j <dig> and j <dig> in the japonica subpanel had the deepest and thickest roots while subpopulations i <dig> and i <dig> as well as j <dig> and j <dig> registered the poorest performances in this respect.table  <dig> result of the analysis of variance and trait broad sense heritability

the correlation coefficients among traits were highly significant and similar in direction within the whole panel and the two subpanels . the magnitude of the differences between the indica and japonica subpanels varied from trait to trait but was generally small, except for combinations involving number of crown roots . the high positive correlations between root dry masses in different layers  were derived from their pyramidal relationships. ncr was highly correlated with til , as expected because the root and tiller emissions are synchronized in rice. to determine whether it was possible to disentangle these two traits, the nr/t ratio was calculated. til, ncr and nr/t were not correlated with the root depth .

a principal components analysis  was run on the adjusted means of all of the accessions. together, the two first axes of the pca explained  <dig>  % of the variation. as shown by the circle of correlations , almost all traits, with the exception of srp and nr_t, which are ratios, were positively correlated with axis  <dig>  axis  <dig> can be viewed as an axis of increasing vigor opposing small and large plants when examining the accession positions on the first plane . r_s was the only trait not correlated to axis  <dig>  the second axis was characterized by an opposition between til, ncr, pdw, sdw, srp and dw <dig>  corresponding to superficial biomass, and depth, mrl, drp and dwb <dig>  corresponding to root biomass in the deepest layer. root biomass in the intermediate layers  was not correlated to axis  <dig>  r_s, thk and llgth were also strongly correlated to axis  <dig>  indicating that deep rooted varieties had also thick roots, long leaves and a high root to shoot ratio, all features that are characteristics of the tropical japonica group. the distribution of the accessions on the first plane  confirmed these interpretations. the two top and the bottom-right quadrants were mostly occupied by indica accessions , while japonica accessions  were mostly found in the lower-left quadrant, showing a much clearer separation than when considering each trait separately. however, the indica and japonica clouds overlapped to some extent, and some indica accessions were found in the middle of the japonica accessions and vice versa. when repeated for the indica and japonica panels separately, the patterns were highly similar to that of the whole panel .fig.  <dig> circle of correlations for a pca conducted on the whole panel and  <dig> traits. llgth = longest leaf length; til = number of tillers; sdw = shoot dry weight; depth = deepest point reached by roots; mrl = maximum root length; ncr = number of crown roots; nr_t = number of crown root per tiller; thk = root thickness; dw0020 = root mass in the 00-20 cm segment; dw2040 = root mass in the 20-40 cm segment; dw4060 = root mass in the 40-60 cm segment; dwb60 = root mass below 60 cm; drw = deep root mass  weight; rdw = root dry weight; pdw = plant dry weight, srp = shallow root proportion ; drp = deep root proportion ; r_s = root to shoot ratio

association mapping
we performed successive association mappings for the whole panel and then separately for the indica and japonica subpanels. the mixed model that included both the structure and kinship matrices exerted good control over false positive rates for most traits as shown by the quantile-quantile plots for the whole set of accessions, the indica set and the japonica set, respectively . on these graphs, for most traits, the cumulative distribution of observed p-values fitted well with the expected uniform distribution that was represented by the diagonal, at least for the smallest log . there were two exceptions, depth for the whole panel and thk for the japonica subpanel, for which the curves moved away from the diagonal. the inflation factor lambda was computed to quantitatively assess the extent of these deviations. lambda was in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  for all traits except these two . for these two trait x panel combinations, a larger number of false positives is expected compared with other combinations.fig.  <dig> quantile-quantile plots for the whole panel , the indica  and the japonica  subpopulations. the different traits are represented by different colors. the black diagonal represents the uniform law. llgth = longest leaf length; til = number of tillers; sdw = shoot dry weight; depth = deepest point reached by roots; mrl = maximum root length; ncr = number of crown roots; nr_t = number of crown root per tiller; thk = root thickness; dw0020 = root mass in the 00–20 cm segment; dw2040 = root mass in the 20–40 cm segment; dw4060 = root mass in the 40–60 cm segment; dwb60 = root mass below 60 cm; drw = deep root mass  weight; rdw = root dry weight; pdw = plant dry weight, srp = shallow root proportion ; drp = deep root proportion ; r_s = root to shoot ratio



in the whole panel, and the indica and japonica subpanels,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> markers, respectively, were significant at p ≤ 1e- <dig> . the higher number of qtls that were detected in the whole panel is most likely the result of its larger size. the most significant associations were recorded for depth on chromosome  <dig>  and ncr on chromosome  <dig>  for the whole panel, thk on chromosome  <dig>  for the indica subpanel, and til on chromosome  <dig>  and depth on chromosome  <dig>  for the japonica subpanel. these p-values all corresponded to q-values less than  <dig> . the manhattan plots of thk and ncr, chosen as examples, are represented by the three panels superimposed in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in a few cases, several physically close but not always adjacent markers showed the exact same level of significance. after verification, these markers appeared to be in full ld. in such cases, the extreme markers are given as an interval  in table  <dig>  most of these intervals were small , but in at least one case  on chromosome  <dig>  the interval covered  <dig>  mb. in another case, for nr_t with the japonica panel, significant markers belonging to different chromosomes were in full ld. this situation involved  <dig> markers distributed across chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the corresponding qtl was not kept in the results table because it was not possible to unambiguously attribute it to a chromosome. some of the qtls were common between the whole panel and the two subpanels, more so for the indica subpanel , which represents 2/ <dig> of the whole panel accessions, than for the japonica subpanel  at p < 1e- <dig>  these numbers increased to  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, when decreasing the threshold to p <1e- <dig> for the significant markers . surprisingly, no association shared by the indica and japonica panels was detected, but half of the markers that were significant in one subpanel were monomorphic  below 5 %) in the other and, were therefore, not tested . in all three panels, the number of significant markers varied from trait to trait, but the range of variation was higher for the whole panel . the number of associations was greater than  <dig> for depth  and ncr  in the whole panel, and for til  in the japonica panel. for the remaining traits, this number was equal to or less than  <dig>  some of the significant markers were associated with several traits as shown in table  <dig>  taking the markers that were common between panels or between traits as a single qtl, a total of  <dig> different sites or segments were significant at p < 1e- <dig> in this study.table  <dig>

among the  <dig> different sites identified,  <dig> were in genes with predicted functions. given the level of ld in the panel, the genes that were within an interval of +/-25 kb on both sides of the significant markers were also surveyed using the query tools of orygenesdb  <cit>  to retrieve  <dig> additional genes, of which  <dig> had predicted functions . this list of qtl-associated genes was first compared to the list of approximately  <dig> genes that were recorded in euroot database  <cit>  that are known, mostly via mutant analysis, to play roles in rice root architecture, root development or water and nutrient transport. no correspondence was found except for plasma membrane intrinsic protein 2; <dig>  gene located 16 kb from q <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  which was significant for thk in the japonica panel . the list of qtl-associated genes was similarly compared with a list of genes that are specifically expressed during crown root formation or development  <cit> . eleven of the qtl-associated genes corresponded to genes that are specifically expressed in different zones of the crown root such as the root cap, the lateral root differentiation zone and the mature zone . most of these genes had a predicted biochemical function, but no precise information could be found regarding their biological functions. selecting only those genes associated with root trait qtls, the literature was then scanned to determine whether information about their biological function or that of their predicted arabidopsis ortholog was available. this approach revealed  <dig> additional interesting candidate genes, which are also listed in table  <dig> table  <dig> list of candidate genes close to the significant markers determined based on function or expression pattern



discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we have phenotyped the root traits of a panel of  <dig> vietnamese varieties in a soil-based phenotyping system to analyze the genetic control of root architecture.

the phenotypic variation of the panel was analyzed at the light of its genetic structure for gwas purpose. the japonica subpanel showed on average poor performance, with lower mean values than the indica subpanel for deep root traits and biomasses. however, the analysis per sub-population shows that the overall subpanel performance masked important differences between subpopulations. these differences seem to be mostly related to ecosystem adaptation and risks of drought, as also shown by lafitte et al.  <cit>  with a sample of varieties originating from across asia. this is true for the japonica subpanel, for which subpopulations j <dig> and j <dig>  with the deepest and thickest roots, include mostly upland rice varieties, while subpopulations j <dig> and j <dig>  with thin and shallow roots, correspond to irrigated and mangrove rice varieties, respectively  <cit> . more surprisingly, the same is also true for the indica subpanel: the two best subpopulations  are almost exclusively composed of upland accessions  and from a mixture of upland and rainfed lowland accessions , whereas the two subpopulations  with the poorest performance originated from irrigated ecosystems  <cit> . the indica types from group i <dig> constitute interesting donors of deep and thick roots that may be easier to use as parents in crosses with other indica vaccessions than the upland japonica accessions, by reducing the risks of f <dig> inter subspecies sterility. the global organization of root variability in this panel highlights the need to control population structure and, because the panel phenotypic differences partly overlapped with the genetic structure for some of the traits, to perform individual analyses of each subpanel rather than only performing an analysis of the whole panel.

in this study, we detected qtls for all the examined traits. their number is generally limited, but some qtls show both good p-values  and q-values  and seem to merit further research, particularly the qtl for thk on chromosome  <dig> and for ncr on chromosome  <dig> 

we found some significant markers located on different chromosomes but in full ld. in such situation, it is impossible to know where the functional mutation is located. this situation of full ld between markers far apart or on different chromosomes is probably much more frequent than was observed in our study but is difficult to detect for non-significant markers and generally goes unnoticed. the risk of such situations is likely higher when the panel size is low, as is the case here for the japonica subpanel.

generally, the markers that were significant for a given trait in the whole panel were also significant for the same trait in the indica or the japonica panel, albeit with lower levels of significance. however, we found ten markers significant in the whole panel but not significant in any of the two subpanels. we did not find any markers associated with the same traits in both the indica and japonica subpanels. these differences in associations detected between panels may be partly due to the limited size of the subpanels, notably of the japonica subpanel, which limits our detection power. a panel size below  <dig> accessions is considered as suboptimal for association detection, notably for low maf markers  <cit> . however, as shown in the example of zhao et al.  <cit>  with subpanel sizes  similar to that of our japonica subpanel, significant associations can still be detected when the marker effects are large. the differences in associations detected between panels may also partly result from the large variation in allelic frequencies in the different panels observed for many markers. these variations themselves result from the strong bipolar organization of the genetic diversity in rice due to the independent domestications of indica and japonica subspecies followed by limited introgressions from one subspecies to the other, mainly in areas of low divergence  <cit> . this second possibility is supported by the reduction of the set of polymorphic markers  from  <dig>  in the whole panel to  <dig>  in the indica subpanel and  <dig> in the japonica subpanel. many of the markers that were polymorphic in one subpanel were considered monomorphic  in the other. only  <dig>  % of the  <dig>  initial markers were polymorphic in both subpanels, while  <dig>  % were monomorphic in both but with different alleles .

when comparing the significant associations identified in this study with those identified by  <cit>  for similar root traits in a japonica panel with no common accessions except the checks, we found one case of co-localization . a marker that was significantly associated with nr_t in our study  was associated with r_s in their study. these authors did not measure nr_t. however, we cannot exclude that this co-localization occurred by chance because the same marker is very far from the threshold of significance for r_s in any panel in our study.

we assessed the function of the genes in which or near which significant markers were located. ospip2; <dig> , at 16 kb of q <dig>  is more specifically expressed in the root exodermis and up-regulated specifically in roots of upland varieties after osmotic stress treatment  <cit> . however, the three markers that were found between the qtl and the gene showed a decreasing level of significance when approaching the gene, and it is difficult to establish a link between the function of this protein and the phenotype  that is associated with the related qtl.

the literature searches for the biological functions of the qtl-associated genes and their predicted arabidopsis ortholog led to interesting candidates. for example, crown root initiation and development in rice are known to involve local auxin flux regulation by the relocation of pin-formed  auxin efflux proteins, resulting in the activation by auxin of the gene encoding the lateral organ boundary domain  transcription factor crown root less  <dig>   <cit> . some genes that are involved in this regulatory pathway were included in the confidence interval of qtls that were related to ncr or nr_t. os01g <dig>  is an ortholog of arabidopsis phytochrome-associated serine/threonine proteinphosphatase <dig> . the fypp1; fypp <dig> double mutant is characterized by an elevation of a phosphorylated pin protein that results in a basal-to-apical subcellular pin accumulation, an increase in root basipetal auxin transport, and a phenotype showing shorter roots and less lateral root formation  <cit> . sorting nexin <dig> , the arabidopsis ortholog of os05g <dig> , shares partial functional redundancy with snx <dig>  which is involved in the endocellular transport of pin <dig> via the formation of snx1-containing endosomes  <cit> . auxin/indole-3-acetic acid  are negative regulators of the auxin response and are involved in crl1gene expression regulation by auxin  <cit> . the over-expression of osiaa <dig>  results in a reduction of the number of crown roots that form after auxin treatment, suggesting that this gene may be involved in the auxin signaling pathway that controls the formation of crown roots  <cit> . crl <dig> regulates genes involved in meristem formation and patterning, such as scarecrow , which acts together with shortroot  to control the division of the cortex-endodermis initial cell in arabidopsis or with quiescent center homeobox , which is an ortholog of the wuschel-related wox <dig> gene, to contribute to the quiescent center and root stem cell specification and maintenance . finally, os07g <dig>  is the ortholog of arabidopsis cyclin d6; <dig> that was identified as a direct target of shr and scr and is involved in the cell division events leading to root meristem formation and function  <cit> . all of these genes may be involved upstream or downstream of crl <dig> in the regulation of crown root formation. osmads <dig>  over-expressing plants display alterations in development, including the over development of crown roots associated with enhanced expression of the transcription factor wox <dig>  another gene that controls the formation and development of crown roots through a crl1-independent pathway  <cit> . os02g <dig> is an ortholog of arabidopsis polycystin- <dig>  lipoxygenase, alpha-toxin and triacylglycerol lipase  <dig> . plat <dig> is induced by abiotic stress and positively regulates lateral root development  <cit> .

some genes whose function is related to root development and that are close to qtls for deep-root biomass have been also identified. os12g <dig>  is an ortholog of arabidopsis atmyb <dig>  which controls stomatal closure and stimulates root development in response to drought  <cit> . os12g <dig>  is the ortholog of mini zinc finger  <dig> , which is a negative regulator of plant development, including root development  <cit> . os01g <dig>  is the ortholog of arabidopsis morphogenesis of root hair  <dig> , which regulates root-hair development  <cit> . finally, os02g <dig> , is an expressed protein of unknown function but was previously reported as a candidate gene underlying a qtl that is related to root mass at depth, based on expression studies  <cit> .

concerning root thickness, os06g <dig>  is an ortholog of root initiation defective  <dig> . rid <dig> is involved in different developmental processes, such as meristem maintenance, and leaf and root morphogenesis. in roots, rid <dig> contributes to the proper expression of scr and wox <dig>  two key genes involved in meristem shaping and root- tissue patterning  <cit> . os03g <dig>  corresponds to gibberelic acid  <dig> oxidase  <dig> , which is a gene underlying a previously identified qtl for vigor at early developmental stages  <cit> . in arabidopsis, ga, together with scr and shr, plays a key role in regulating the differentiation of supernumerary cortex cell layers in roots  <cit> ; thus, the function of osga20ox <dig> should be further investigated. similarly, cytokinins play a key role with auxin in root vascular patterning  <cit> . os07g <dig> , which encodes the response regulator  <dig> , may be involved in this process.

several genes were identified whose reported biological function is consistent with the associated phenotype, the rice gene or its predicted arabidopsis ortholog . knock-down or gain-of-function mutants of these genes should be generated to further investigate their function in the related phenotypes. nevertheless, the fact that two genes are predicted to be orthologs in rice and arabidopsis based on sequence homology does not guarantee that their function is conserved between the two species. in addition, several genes supporting qtls initially had unknown functions  <cit> . therefore, to further validate these qtls, it will be interesting to conduct an exhaustive differential expression study between contrasting varieties for the related phenotype for all genes included in the confidence interval of a given qtl. this approach has often been used as a criterion to restrict the number of candidate genes underlying a qtl independently of their putative function  <cit> . another way to validate these qtls, which were detected on a statistical basis, is to develop mapping populations segregating for the qtl. although time consuming, this approach is a necessary step towards the positional cloning of the qtl. marker haplotypes were established in the regions of the qtls for ncr on chromosome  <dig> and thk on chromosome  <dig>  which are the two most significant qtls. accessions of the panel with contrasting haplotypes will be used in a future study to make crosses and develop mapping populations in an indica background for ncr and in a japonica background for thk.
