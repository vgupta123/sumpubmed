BACKGROUND
the tho complex, which is a sub-member of trex , was originally identified in saccharomyces cerevisiae as a five protein complex   <cit>  that plays a role in transcriptional elongation, nuclear rna export and genome stability. in higher eukaryotes such as drosophila melanogaster <cit>  or humans  <cit> , three proteins,  and three additional unique proteins were identified, namely thoc5/fms interacting protein   <cit> , thoc <dig> and thoc <dig>  as members of the tho complex. however, it is still unclear whether all members of tho complex play a role as one functional unit.

we have previously shown that thoc <dig> is a substrate for several tyrosine kinases such as macrophage-colony stimulating factor  receptor, fms  <cit> , and various leukemogenic tyrosine kinases, such as bcr-abl , translocation-ets-leukemia -platelet derived growth factor  receptor, or nucleophosmin -anaplastic lymphoma kinase   <cit> . in addition, we have recently shown that dna damage causes loss of the rna binding potential of thoc <dig>  <cit> , and protein kinase c phosphorylates and inhibits nuclear import of thoc <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that thoc <dig> is regulated by extracellular signalling. furthermore, the ectopic expression or the depletion of thoc <dig> in mouse myeloid progenitor or mesenchymal progenitor cell lines causes abnormal hematopoiesis or abnormal muscle differentiation, respectively, suggesting that the expression level of thoc <dig> is important for the normal differentiation process  <cit> . we have previously identified thoc <dig> dependent mrnas in the fibroblast system  <cit> . surprisingly, only  <dig> genes were downregulated by depletion of thoc <dig>  however, over 40% of these genes were involved in differentiation processes. furthermore, we recently examined thoc <dig> dependent mrnas in monocytes/macrophages. in this system also, only  <dig> genes were down-regulated upon depletion of thoc <dig>  <cit> . along the same line, depletion of thoc <dig> does not affect bulk poly  + rna export  <cit>  and it has been recently shown that the knockdown of thoc <dig> in hela cells leads to down-regulation of  <dig> genes  <cit> .

using interferon inducible thoc <dig> knockout mice, we have previously shown that the depletion of the thoc <dig> gene causes rapid apoptosis of hematopoietic cells, but not of any other organs. after bone marrow transplantation, mice survived for more than 3 months without any symptoms, suggesting that thoc <dig> plays a key role in maintaining hematopoietic cells. however, since interferon is one of the important cytokines for hematopoiesis  <cit> , the observed phenotype may be due to the synergistic effects of interferon and knockdown of thoc <dig>  furthermore, depletion of the thoc <dig> gene resulting from treatment with poly i:c is limited to certain organs.

we therefore generated tamoxifen inducible thoc <dig> knockout mice. the treatment of mice with tamoxifen caused deletion of thoc <dig> exons 4/ <dig> from bone marrow, colon, stomach, jejunum, liver, and kidney. we show here that thoc <dig> not only plays a key role in hematopoiesis, but also in another regenerative organ, the gastrointestinal tract. on the other hand, depletion of thoc <dig> in terminally differentiated organs such as liver or kidney did not result in any pathological alterations, nor did it influence mrna export. finally, we show that a subset of wingless/integrated  target mrnas is thoc <dig> dependent. these data suggest that mrna export protein thoc <dig> controls the differentiation in a wide range of regenerative organs.

RESULTS
thoc <dig> exons 4/ <dig> were deleted from bone marrow, colon, liver, and kidney, but not from lung after tamoxifen treatment
to extend previous work on thoc <dig> function to a broader range of organs and cell types, we generated a novel inducible thoc <dig> knockout mouse strain. we used tamoxifen-induced cre-recombinase expression in rosa26-creert <dig> mice  <cit> . in rosa26-creert <dig> mice, the creert <dig> fusion gene is under the control of the rosa <dig> promoter and hence ubiquitously expressed in all organs. however, gene recombination is only induced by injection of the synthetic ligand, tamoxifen that leads to formation of an active cre-recombinase  <cit> . thoc <dig>  mice  were mated to rosa26-creert <dig> mice, generating tamoxifen inducible thoc <dig> knockout mice. the deletion mutation of thoc <dig> was induced by intraperitoneal  injection with tamoxifen twice at 2-day intervals. we injected 5-9-week old rosa26-creert <dig>  and rosa26-creert2:thoc <dig>  mice  with tamoxifen. two or four days after the first tamoxifen injection, mice were sacrificed and deletion of a functional thoc <dig> was analyzed by pcr using exons 4/ <dig> specific primers in genomic dnas from bone marrow , colon, kidney, liver, lung and spleen. as control, exon  <dig> specific pcr was performed. in all control rosa26-creert <dig> mice and rosa26-creert2:thoc <dig>  mice without tamoxifen treatment, an exon 4/ <dig> specific product  and exon  <dig> specific product  were detected from all organs. thoc <dig> exons 4/ <dig> were deleted from bone marrow , colon, kidney and liver of rosa26-creert2:thoc <dig>  mice within 2 days after tamoxifen treatment, but not from lung and spleen . to examine whether thoc <dig> exons 4/ <dig> were only partially deleted in lung and spleen, genomic dnas from lung and spleen were analyzed by pcr using introns 3/ <dig> specific primers. corresponding bands gave 1110 bp  and 355 bp sizes , respectively. a pcr product lacking exons 4/ <dig>  was detected in both organs within 2 days , indicating that thoc <dig> exons 4/ <dig> were only partially deleted in lung and spleen.

we next examined thoc <dig> at the protein level. the deletion of exons 4/ <dig> of thoc <dig> causes a frame shift of product and the truncated protein is expected to be only  <dig> amino acids long and lacking the thoc <dig> binding domain  <cit> . however, we did not detect the truncated small thoc <dig> product in all organs. the level of thoc <dig> protein did not change in organs from rosa26-creert <dig> control mice before or after tamoxifen treatment, however in rosa26-creert2:thoc <dig>  bone marrow, colon, stomach, jejunum, kidney and liver the level of thoc <dig> was reduced to less than 20% within 6 days in all mice . the level of thoc <dig> product in spleen was reduced by only 40% . we then examined the thoc <dig> mrnas in spleen. as control, we applied mrna obtained from liver in which the thoc <dig> product was reduced to 10% of control liver within 4 days after tamoxifen treatment . as expected, from liver only mrna without exons 4/ <dig>  was detected after tamoxifen treatment. in agreement with data obtained from genomic dna and protein , both mrna with  and without  exons 4/ <dig> were detected in spleen  <dig> and 4 days after tamoxifen treatment, suggesting that thoc <dig> is deleted in a particular population of spleen cells. notably, in interferon inducible thoc <dig> knockout mice, thoc <dig> was depleted in bone marrow or liver, but not in the gastrointestinal tract  <cit> , while in tamoxifen inducible knockout mice thoc <dig> was also depleted in the gastrointestinal tract.

thoc <dig> inactivation results in rapid death
to study the effects of thoc <dig> deletion, tamoxifen was injected twice at 2 days intervals  in 6-week old rosa26-creert2:thoc <dig>   and rosa26-creert <dig>  control mice. all rosa26-creert2:thoc <dig>  mice died within 1 week, while control mice did not show any symptoms . considering the kinetics of thoc <dig> inactivation after tamoxifen injection and our previous observations in interferon-inducible thoc <dig> inactivation, we speculated that loss of thoc <dig> in kidney, liver, bone marrow and/or gut might combine to cause lethality.

depletion of the thoc <dig> gene causes loss of nucleated bone marrow cells
we have previously shown that using an interferon inducible knockout mouse system thoc <dig> is essential to sustain hematopoiesis in adult mice. we therefore examined whether tamoxifen inducible thoc <dig> knockout mice show a similar phenotype. spleen and bone marrow were isolated from 6- to 9-week old rosa26-creert2:thoc <dig>   and rosa26-creert <dig> control  mice on day  <dig>  to day  <dig> after tamoxifen treatment. in agreement with data using interferon inducible thoc <dig> knockout mice, nucleated bone marrow cells dropped in numbers already 2 days after tamoxifen treatment and after 6 days nucleated cells were very scarce . bone marrow cells from control mice did not show any alteration after tamoxifen treatment .

loss of proliferative cells in thoc <dig> depleted spleen
we then examined the effect on the spleen. spleen weight that is normalized to total body weight of control rosa26-creert <dig> mice was not altered after tamoxifen treatment, while spleen weight of rosa26-creert2:thoc <dig>  was decreased to approximately half  <dig> or 6 days after tamoxifen treatment . it should be noted that at this period, thoc <dig> depleted mice also lost approximately 20% body-weight. we then counted cell numbers per mg spleen tissue. six days after tamoxifen treatment white cell numbers were decreased to 60% in thoc <dig> depleted mice . to determine which cell type were decreased in spleen by deletion of thoc <dig>  we next examined the morphological alterations to the spleen.

although no obvious differences in the morphology of the splenic parenchyma were detected between thoc <dig> depleted and control spleens, there is a clear reduction in the number of b cells visualized by paired box  <dig>  specific staining . in addition, there is a clear reduction in the fraction of ki <dig> positive proliferating cells . the ki <dig> positive cells in the control spleens are mainly in the area in which there is a lack of b-cells, including germinal centers, in the thoc <dig> depleted spleen. this suggests that thoc <dig> depleted spleens do not contain proliferating b-cells. on the other hand, no obvious difference was observed in cd <dig> positive cells before or after tamoxifen treatment .

depletion of the thoc <dig> gene did not cause pathological alterations in liver or kidney
we next examined other organs, kidney and liver. in agreement with our previous data  <cit> , we did not see any pathological alterations, such as inflammation, or any activated caspase  <dig> positive cells in kidney or liver . since hepatocytes produce a number of key molecules and enzymes such as albumin or transferrin for the maintenance of life, we examined whether albumin or transferrin mrnas were exported into the cytoplasm in the thoc <dig> depleted liver. we isolated cytoplasmic and nuclear rnas from 20 μg of liver tissue before and after thoc <dig> knockdown , and then analyzed albumin, transferrin and actin expression by semi-quantitative rt-pcr. as control for fractionation, protein extracts of both fractions obtained from 200 μg liver tissues were supplied for histone h <dig> , and gapdh  specific immunoblot . in this experiment only spliced forms of mrna can be detected since we have chosen the primer pair for rt-pcr which is located at two different exons . as shown in figure 4d, upon depletion of thoc <dig> the export of albumin as well as transferrin mrnas were not altered.

alb : albumin ; ascl <dig> : achaete scute complex homolog  <dig> ; ; birc <dig> : baculoviral iap repeat-containing  <dig> ; fn <dig> : fibronectin <dig> ; gapdh : glyceraldehyde- <dig> phosphate dehydrogenase ; gusb : glucouronidase beta ; mmp <dig> : matrix metallopeptidase  <dig> ; ptgs <dig> : prostaglandin-endoperoxidase synthase  <dig> ; snai <dig> : snail homolog  <dig> ; sox <dig> : sry-box containing gene  <dig> ; sox <dig>  ; beta-actin : ; beta-actin  ; thoc <dig> : tho complex subunit  <dig> homolog ; trf : transferrin ; wnt <dig> : wingless-related mmtv integration site  <dig> ; (): product size.

in addition, we examined the level of serum albumin before and after tamoxifen treatment. the level of serum albumin was not altered by depletion of thoc <dig> for 7 days . interestingly, liver expresses thoc <dig> at relatively high levels on the protein and mrna levels  <cit> , however our data revealed that thoc <dig> is not required for maintenance of central liver functions. this may be due to the strong regenerative potency of hepatocytes. we are currently examining the role of thoc <dig> in regenerating liver. furthermore, no pathological alterations were found in other organs such as brain, heart, lung, or testicles and no clear inflammatory response was detected in thoc <dig> depleted organs at any time .

depletion of the thoc <dig> gene in gastrointestinal epithelial cells causes severe degeneration
we next examined the gastrointestinal tract. gastrointestinal tissues were isolated from 6- to 9-week old rosa26-creert <dig> and rosa26-creert2:thoc <dig>  mice on day  <dig>  to day  <dig> after tamoxifen treatment. notably, 6 days after tamoxifen treatment the length of small intestine from rosa26-creert2:thoc <dig>  mice was reduced to half , and the length of colon was slightly reduced . depletion of thoc <dig> caused severe degenerative lesions in the small intestine . the epithelial villi  were disordered and shortened, and the crypts  in thoc <dig> depleted mice show severe dilatation and necrosis , and sometimes sloughing of cells . it should be noted that the changes are minimally associated with influx of inflammatory cells. we then examined thoc <dig> expression in intestinal epithelial cells. thoc <dig> is expressed in the nucleus of most intestinal epithelial cells, including the most prevalent enterocytes, in control mice and in non-treated rosa26-creert2:thoc <dig>  mice, however 3 days after tamoxifen treatment, thoc <dig> was drastically reduced in the intestinal epithelial cells from rosa26-creert2:thoc <dig>  mice . we next stained serial sections with ki <dig> and cleaved caspase  <dig> specific antibodies. upon depletion of thoc <dig>  ki <dig> positive cells were drastically reduced , while cleaved caspase  <dig> positive cells were detected in the crypt lesion 3 days after tamoxifen treatment, and 5 days after tamoxifen treatment cleaved caspase  <dig> positive cells were distributed throughout whole villi , suggesting that the structural breakdown of stem cell niche, and/or bacterial infection causes apoptosis of more differentiated epithelial cells.

thoc <dig> expression was drastically reduced not only in small intestine, but also in caecum and colon from thoc <dig> depleted mice 5 days after tamoxifen treatment . furthermore, depletion of thoc <dig> caused severe degenerative lesions in the small intestine, and some parts of caecum, and to a lesser extent in the large intestine . severe pathological alterations in small intestinal epithelial cells may be due to the rapid turnover of epithelial cells, however we observed pathological alterations clearly in caecum and colon, where the rate of turnover and proliferation is also quite high, suggesting that thoc <dig> is required generally for rapidly proliferating cells in the gut. this is quite different from thoc <dig>  knockout phenotype which showed that pathological alteration was observed only in stem cells from the small intestine  <cit> . it is not clear whether the function of thoc <dig> and/or the efficiency of the tamoxifen inducible system are different than those of thoc <dig>  we did not observe any pathological alterations in tamoxifen treated control mice. the damage of epithelial cells caused translocation of bacteria into the underlying blood vessels , which may cause toll-like receptor activation  <cit> .

depletion of the thoc <dig> gene causes bacterial infection that originates from the gastrointestinal tract
we next isolated blood from heart and incubated it on blood agar plates. no bacterial colonies grew until 2 days after tamoxifen treatment, however colonies  were detected in blood from heart in  <dig> out of  <dig> mice 4 days after tamoxifen treatment. five to seven days after tamoxifen treatment, more than  <dig> bacterial colonies were isolated from 100 μl blood from heart of all thoc <dig> depleted mice . bacterial colonies were not observed from control mice at any time point. to confirm that the bacteria which were obtained from heart blood originated from the intestines, we next identified bacterial strains in blood from the heart by dna sequencing using a solid 5500xl system. ninety-seven% of isolated bacteria were identified as gammaproteobacteria that include escherichia coli that in our mouse colony represents a minor but readily detectable constituent of the gut microbiota . this indicates that bacteria detectable in blood indeed originated from the gastrointestinal tract. these data imply that the mice died of sepsis. since mice also exhibit several defects in immune system , the immune defects may also contribute to the onset of sepsis.

thoc <dig> is indispensable for processing of inducible mrnas by wnt or toll-like receptor signaling
wnt/beta-catenin signaling is a major regulator of homeostatic self-renewal within the intestinal crypt  <cit> . evidences have accumulated that the tho complex plays an important role in processing of a subset of genes induced by growth factors/cytokines, serum or heat-shock. thereby, the tho complex is recruited to its target genes and then binds to the target mrnas  <cit> . we next examined whether wnt target mrnas are processed in a thoc <dig> dependent manner. it must be noted that we have previously identified thoc <dig> target mrnas using the mouse embryonic fibroblast system  <cit> . one of these target mrnas is sry-box containing gene  <dig>  mrna which is one of the known wnt targets  <cit> . we performed sox <dig> specific in situ hybridization in thoc <dig> depleted intestines. sox <dig> transcripts were detected in the intestinal crypt in control intestines, however upon depletion of thoc <dig>  the sox <dig> transcript was reduced . we further examined other wnt target mrnas, achaete-scute complex homolog  <dig>  <cit> , and fibronectin  <dig>   <cit> . in control intestines ascl <dig> is expressed in the intestinal crypt  <cit> , while fn <dig> was detected also in villi . upon depletion of thoc <dig>  the ascl <dig> but not fn <dig> transcripts were reduced . beta-actin transcripts were detected at unaltered levels in control and thoc <dig> depleted small intestine. these data suggest that some of wnt target mrnas may be thoc <dig> dependent. however, thoc <dig> depletion partially causes the loss of cellularity in the small intestine, and we therefore cannot rule out that depletion of wnt target mrnas is simply due to the pathological alteration of the small intestine or due to a reduction in the numbers of cells expressing these mrnas. we then further confirmed that wnt target mrnas are indeed tho complex dependent by isolating thoc5-mrnas complex  <cit> . for this experiment, endogenous thoc <dig> was immunoprecipitated by thoc <dig> specific monoclonal antibody from the nuclear fraction from mouse embryonic fibroblasts, or mouse hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, hepa1- <dig>  as control, the same fraction was precipitated by normal mouse igg. notably, thoc <dig> was detected in the thoc <dig> specific immunoprecipitates, but not in the control igg precipitates . thoc5-mrna complex was examined by rt-pcr using specific primers for detection of  <dig> wnt target mrnas  <cit> , namely, the sox <dig>  ascl <dig>  snail family zinc finger  <dig> , wingless-related mmtv integration site  <dig> , baculoviral iap repeat-containing  <dig> , matrix metallopeptidase  <dig>  and fn <dig>  and as controls, gusb and beta-actin transcripts were examined. as shown in figure 6b, wnt target mrna, sox <dig>  ascl <dig>  snai <dig>  wnt <dig>  and survivin, but not mmp <dig> or fn <dig>  were detected in the thoc5-mrnas complex, indicating that a subset of wnt target mrnas are indeed thoc <dig> dependent. along the same line, we recently found that cytokine induced immediate-early genes, v-ets erythroblastosis virus e <dig> oncogene homolog  <dig>  or ets <dig>  but not early growth response  <dig> , were thoc <dig> dependent, indicating that not all induced genes were thoc <dig> dependent  <cit> . we then examined one of toll-like receptor target mrnas, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase  <dig> . ptgs <dig> mrna was also isolated in the thoc5-mrna complex , indicating that toll-like receptor signalling is also impaired by depletion of thoc <dig>  we next examined whether thoc <dig> plays a role in processing of wnt target mrnas, sox <dig> or ascl <dig>  we isolated nuclear and cytoplasmic rna from thoc <dig> depleted mouse embryonic fibroblasts  or bone marrow derived macrophages derived from rosa26-creert2:thoc <dig>  mice. beta actin mrna was used as an internal control for equal amounts of cdna used for each sample . as control for fractionation, aliquots of protein extracts from each sample were supplied for histone h <dig> , and gapdh  specific immunoblot . spliced sox <dig> and ascl <dig> mrnas were exported in the presence of thoc <dig>  however, depletion of thoc <dig> drastically reduced the export . to determine the effect of thoc <dig> in the target mrna processing, we next examined the spliced and unspliced forms of sox <dig> mrna in the nuclear fraction before and after deletion of thoc <dig>  the unspliced form of sox <dig> mrna also accumulated in the nucleus upon depletion of thoc <dig> , indicating that thoc <dig> contributes not only to the mrna export, but also to the efficient processing of target mrna or the degradation of unspliced mrnas.

presently, it is not clear how the tho complex selects its target mrnas. recently, katahira et al.  <cit>  proposed that thoc <dig> controls an alternative polyadenylation site choice by recruiting cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor  <dig>   on target genes. however, 70-75% of human mrnas contain a potential alternative polyadenylation site  <cit> . moreover, snai <dig>  does not contain this site. alternatively, it has been previously shown in the yeast system that yeast homolog of thoc <dig>  hpr <dig> is preferentially required for transcription of either long or gc rich dna sequences  <cit> . interestingly, the coding region  of sox <dig>  ascl <dig>  snai <dig>  and wnt <dig>  contain gc to a great degree , while thoc <dig> independent genes contain 54-55% gc. however, the target selectivity of thoc <dig> remains to be studied.

it has been previously shown that depletion of the wnt target gene, ascl <dig> results in a similar phenotype with pathological alterations of small intestinal epithelial cells  <cit>  to the phenotype observed in thoc <dig> depleted epithelial cells, however thoc <dig> depleted mice showed more severe alterations of phenotype than ascl <dig> −/− mice. this may be due to the fact that thoc <dig> knockout causes depletion of the pool of wnt target mrnas.

these data imply that some population of genes inducible by growth factors/cytokines, wnt signaling, and probably also toll-like receptor signaling are thoc <dig> dependent, thus thoc <dig> plays a crucial role in proliferation/differentiation processes in regenerative organs. furthermore, these data also provide evidence that thoc <dig> may be a useful tool for modification of the differentiation processes, and for cancer therapy.

CONCLUSIONS
thoc <dig> is indispensable for processing of only a subset of mrnas, but plays a key role in processing of mrnas inducible by wnt signals. furthermore, thoc <dig> is dispensable for general mrna export in terminally differentiated organs, indicating that multiple mrna export pathways exist. these data imply that thoc <dig> may be a useful tool for studying intestinal stem cells, for modifying the differentiation processes and for cancer therapy.
