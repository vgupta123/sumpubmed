BACKGROUND
the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes hr6a and hr6b are two very similar mammalian homologs of yeast rad <dig>  <cit> . ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes act together with ubiquitin-activating  and ubiquitin-ligating  enzymes, to conjugate the small  <dig> kda ubiquitin protein to specific protein substrates. poly-ubiquitylation usually targets a substrate for degradation by the proteasome  <cit> , whereas mono-ubiquitylation is involved in various processes including dna repair and regulation of gene expression  <cit> . in yeast, rad6p is involved in different pathways, interacting with different e <dig> ubiquitin ligase partners. together with the ubiquitin ligase ubr <dig>  rad <dig> ubiquitylates proteins with destabilizing n-termini  <cit> . the yeast rad6-rad <dig> heterodimer ubiquitylates proliferating cell nuclear antigen  at sites of stalled replication forks during s phase  <cit> . in addition, rad6p and the ubiquitin ligase bre <dig> are required for ubiquitylation of histone h2b  <cit> , a histone modification that is generally associated with ongoing gene transcription  <cit> . sequential h2b ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation are associated with transcription elongation of certain genes  <cit> . however, rad6p, and h2b ubiquitylation are also required for silencing of telomeres  <cit> . ubiquitylation of h2b by rad <dig> depends on phosphorylation of s <dig> by the cyclin dependent kinases bur <dig> and bur <dig>  <cit> . s120a rad <dig> mutants also showed a slow growth phenotype  <cit> . in human cells, hr6a has also been shown to be a phosphoprotein, and phosphorylation of the conserved s <dig> residue of hr6a greatly enhanced its in vitro ubiquitylation activity  <cit> .

chromatin structure depends to a great extent on posttranslational modifications of histones. the combinatorial presence of different acetylations, methylations, phosphorylations, ubiquitylations and sumoylations of the different core histones constitutes the so-called histone code  <cit> , which provides a specific binding platform for regulatory proteins that may also mediate the addition or removal of such posttranslational modifications, or otherwise affect chromatin accessibility.

ubiquitylation of h2b was shown to be required for subsequent trimethylation of h3k <dig> and h3k <dig>  <cit> . however, recent data suggest that ubiquitylation of h2b may not be the sole determinant for these modifications in yeast, and that another bre <dig> substrate may also be involved  <cit> . these modifications are known to localize to active chromatin. in mammalian cells, two bre <dig> homologs have been identified; rnf20/bre1a and rnf40/bre1b, and both appear to be involved in h2b ubiquitylation  <cit> . it has been reported that ubch <dig>  and not hr6a or hr6b, is the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that acts together with rnf <dig> and rnf <dig> to ubiquitylate h2b  <cit> . however, more recent data have shown that depletion of both hr6a and hr6b from human cells results in strongly reduced h2b ubiquitylation  <cit> . in addition, both rad6p homologs interact directly with the bre1a/bre1b heterodimer  <cit> .

since hr6a and hr6b differ at only  <dig> amino acid positions, it is thought that the proteins perform redundant functions, and single gene mutations therefore yield relatively mild phenotypes in mouse  <cit> . hr6a knockout male mice are normal, and females display maternal factor infertility  <cit> . in contrast hr6b knockout females are normal, and males are infertile  <cit> . these opposing phenotypes may be due to the fact that hr6a is expressed at a much higher levels than hr6b in oocytes, whereas the reverse is true for developing spermatids  <cit> . this differential gene expression in male and female developing germ cells is related to the fact that hr6a is encoded by the x chromosome  <cit> , and oocytes have two active x chromosomes  <cit> , whereas the x chromosome is inactivated during spermatogenesis  <cit> .

as homologous chromosomes pair and align during meiotic prophase, a protein structure is formed that connects the chromosomal axes of the paired chromosomes. this complex is called the synaptonemal complex  . at the zygotene stage of meiotic prophase, pairing has commenced, and the pairing is completed at the pachytene stage. the largely heterologous x and y chromosomes pair only in the pseudoautosomal region. during the transition from zygotene to pachytene, the presence of unsynapsed sex chromosome arms triggers silencing of x and y, leading to xy body formation and so-called meiotic sex chromosome inactivation  . during postmeiotic spermatid development, several x chromosomal genes are re-expressed or first expressed in the haploid round spermatids, but the average expression level of x chromosomal genes is still low compared to that of autosomal genes  <cit> . in addition, spermatids, carrying either an x or a y chromosome, form a distinct postmeiotic sex chromatin  area that is enriched for specific histone modifications such as the heterochromatin marker h3k9me <dig>  <cit> . recently, mueller et al  <cit>  showed that the mouse x chromosome is enriched for multicopy genes that show postmeiotic expression. rna fish data suggest that the presence of multiple copies enhances the chance of these genes to produce a transcript in a generally repressive chromatin environment  <cit> .

hr6b and rad <dig> are both enriched on the xy body of mouse pachytene spermatocytes  <cit> . previously, we have shown that mutational loss of hr6b results in specific defects in chromatin structure regulation, visualized by aberrant sc structure and histone modification patterns  <cit> . surprisingly, global ubiquitylation of h2a and h2b, measured in extracts isolated from hr6b knockout spermatocytes and spermatids, was not affected  <cit> . in contrast, we observed an increased amount of h3k4me <dig> specifically on the xy body in spermatocytes and on the sex chromosomes in round spermatids  <cit> . in addition, h2at <dig> phosphorylation was enhanced, first on the xy body of late pachytene spermatocytes, and somewhat later in meiotic prophase also on autosomal chromatin of diplotene and metaphase i spermatocytes. finally, h3k9me <dig> was lost from centromeric chromatin in hr6b knockout late spermatocytes and round spermatids  <cit> . with quantitative rt-pcr  analysis for selected autosomal and x chromosomal genes, we found a specific derepression of x-chromosomal gene activity for rna isolated from mixed germ cells and purified spermatids from hr6b knockout mice  <cit> . from this, we concluded that hr6b controls different histone modifications in spermatocytes and spermatids, which contributes to the postmeiotic maintenance of x chromosome silencing.

herein, we have performed a global analysis of gene expression in purified spermatocytes and spermatids from wild type and hr6b knockout mice. this allowed us to link the observed changes in the histone code, caused by loss of hr6b, to changes in gene expression in a more global manner. we found a very limited change in gene expression in hr6b knockout spermatocytes compared to wild type cells. in sharp contrast, hr6b knockout spermatids show numerous changes in gene expression. the present results show that hr6b is an important factor that is required for the maintenance of sex chromosome inactivation in both spermatocytes and spermatids. in addition, our data provide novel information about the capability of wild type spermatids to transcriptionally activate a large number of single-copy x-linked genes.

RESULTS
hr6a/b is enriched on the xy body and centromeric chromatin of pachytene spermatocytes
previously, we have shown that hr6a/b is enriched on the xy body of pachytene spermatocytes  <cit> . using different antibodies that recognize phosphorylated  and nonphosphorylated hr6a/b, we performed a more detailed analysis of hr6a/b subnuclear localization throughout meiosis. these antibodies were directed against phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated yeast rad <dig> peptides that show high similarity to the analogous sequence of mouse hr6a and hr6b . we used an antibody against the synaptonemal complex protein  <dig>  to substage the meiotic prophase. figure 1a shows the results of immunostaining for hr6a/b using a polyclonal antibody directed against nonphosphorylated rad6p. specific signal was observed as small foci in the nucleus and on the developing scs in leptotene and zygotene. in pachytene, hr6a/b is enriched on the xy body, and accumulates on the sc ends. during diplotene, hr6a/b is gradually lost from the nucleus, except from the centromeric regions that become highly enriched during metaphase. in spermatids, no specific staining was observed . using an antibody against the same phosphorylated epitope , phr6a/b showed a more clear enrichment on centromeric dna of early pachytene nuclei, and on the xy body during late pachytene. during later stages, including metaphase, phr6a/b was absent from centromeric dna .

x-linked spindlin-like gene transcription is upregulated in hr6b knockout spermatocytes
rna isolated from highly purified samples of spermatocytes and spermatids from wild type and hr6b knockout mouse testes was used for microarray analysis. following data normalization and statistical analyses, we found only  <dig> gene, apart from hr6b, that was differentially expressed in hr6b-/- spermatocytes. in contrast,  <dig>  corrected) probes were up- or downregulated in hr6b-/- spermatids. at a lower cutoff , we found  <dig> probes to be differentially expressed. an overview of the changes in gene expression in spermatocytes and spermatids is given in figure  <dig>  and the list of differentially expressed genes is available in additional file  <dig>  the single gene that was differentially expressed in spermatocytes, is a protein encoding gene named 4930408f14rik. it showed a  <dig>  fold upregulation in hr6b-/- spermatocytes on the array, and  <dig>  fold upregulation using qrtpcr analysis . 4930408f14rik is an x-linked gene, encoding a  <dig> aa protein which contains three spindlin/spermiogenesis-specific protein  domains . the open reading frame encoded by 4930408f14rik shows high similarity to the spindlin proteins spin <dig> , spin <dig>  and spin <dig> . spin <dig> is located on chromosome  <dig>  whereas spin <dig> and spin <dig> are on the x chromosome. further analysis showed that 4930408f14rik is a member of a multicopy spindlin-like gene family on chromosome x. the x chromosome contains a relatively high number of multicopy genes that are expressed in spermatids. mueller et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> testis-expressed multicopy genes on the x chromosome, and they identified  <dig> copies of a gene family encoding proteins containing one or more spin-ssty domains, named eg <dig> and distributed over  <dig> amplicons. we performed a blast search with the sequence of 4930408f14rik and identified a total of  <dig> closely related family members  on the x, that are localized to three clusters on the x chromosome . in addition, the y chromosome encodes the spindlin-like genes ssty <dig> and ssty <dig>  and many other ssty-like genes. although not statistically significant, the array data revealed a  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold upregulation for ssty <dig>  and ssty <dig>  in spermatocytes, but not in spermatids, of hr6b knockout mice. interestingly, spin <dig> and the x-encoded spin <dig> and spin <dig> were not differentially expressed. we verified the upregulation of ssty <dig> using qrtpcr .

overall repression of autosomal gene expression in hr6b knockout spermatids
in spermatids, approximately 29% of the annotated genes were found to be differentially expressed, and the majority of these genes  were downregulated . we verified the differential expression of several of the most significantly differentially expressed genes using qrtpcr . these results indicate that hr6b deficiency has an enormous effect on gene expression in round spermatids. to obtain more insight in the regulatory pathways that are affected in hr6b knockout spermatids,  <dig> probes that showed significant up- or downregulation were uploaded to ingenuity pathway analysis software.  <dig> probes could be mapped to a gene. from these,  <dig> were 'network eligible', meaning that they encode molecules which interact with other molecules present in ingenuity's knowledge base, and  <dig> genes were 'functions eligible', which implies that the encoded proteins have at least one functional annotation or disease association in the knowledge base. in accordance with the fact that quite an abundant number of genes were differentially expressed, many gene networks were found to be affected in hr6b knockout spermatids. the most affected gene networks include post-translational modification, cancer, cell cycle, cell morphology, cellular assembly and organization, rna post-transcriptional modification, dna replication, recombination and repair, and embryonic development . when we analysed which canonical pathways are affected by loss of hr6b, the ubiquitin pathway was found in the top  <dig> . in total,  <dig> genes of the ubiquitin pathway are included in this database, and  <dig> of these genes were downregulated and  <dig> were upregulated in hr6b knockout spermatids; the other  <dig> genes were not differentially expressed, and therefore not taken into consideration .

derepression of major satellite repeat transcription
previously, we have observed global increases in h2at <dig> phosphorylation and macroh2a levels in late spermatocytes of hr6b knockout mice  <cit> , and these changes might lead to the large overall changes in gene expression in spermatids. one of the most striking aberrations observed in hr6b knockout spermatocytes  and spermatids, is the loss of h3k9me <dig> from centromeric dna  <cit> . h3k9me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> are known to be enriched at heterochromatic non-genic regions of the genome, including centromeric dna regions  <cit> , that contain the major and minor satellite repeats. therefore, we also analysed whether transcription of the major and minor satellite repeats might be affected. to this end, we performed rtpcr and qrtpcr experiments using the same rna samples that were used for the array. we also analysed transcript levels of several other repeat sequences in the genome . upregulation of major satellite repeat rna levels was found for hr6b knockout spermatocytes. however, for spermatids, this effect was not observed . analysis of other repeat elements in the genome revealed either a very low expression in all samples  or no significant differences between wild type and knockout samples .

global upregulation of x-linked gene transcription in hr6b knockout spermatids
we analysed the chromosomal distribution of all differentially expressed genes to see whether some of these genes might cluster to specific areas. we found that the up- and downregulated genes were randomly distributed, with no apparent clustering to specific chromosomes and regions . the majority of the genes were downregulated, with the exception of genes on chromosome  <dig> for which we found an equal distribution of up- and downregulation . in striking contrast, from the  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed on the x chromosome, 90% were upregulated. subsequently, we calculated the walking average of gene expression along the x chromosome and along chromosome  <dig>  in wild type and hr6b knockout spermatocytes and spermatids. the overall pattern of gene expression along the chromosomes is similar in the two genotypes. however, in this comparison, a global upregulation specifically for the x chromosome in hr6b knockout spermatids was detected . we also compared the average expression level of each chromosome in spermatocytes and spermatids of wild type and hr6b knockout mice . in spermatocytes, the average expression levels from the autosomes were comparable, and did not differ between wild type and knockout. the average expression level from the x is approximately 10-fold lower due to msci, and not different between wild type and knockout. interestingly, in spermatids, the average expression level is higher in wild type than knockout for all autosomes except for chromosome  <dig>  in contrast, the average x-linked expression is clearly higher in hr6b knockout compared to wild type spermatids.

x-linked multicopy genes are specifically upregulated from the x chromosome in hr6b knockout spermatocytes
during postmeiotic spermatid development, most single-copy x- and y-linked genes remain repressed, but many multicopy and some single-copy genes are expressed from the x and y chromosomes to high levels  <cit> . in the present study, the only gene that showed significant upregulation in hr6b knockout spermatocytes is the multicopy spindle-like gene 4930408f14rik. however, in hr6b knockout round spermatids, we observed a global increase in x-linked gene expression, all along the x chromosome. to study whether hr6b might have a differential effect on multicopy versus single-copy x-linked genes, we decided to analyse the expression of the whole group of multicopy genes described by mueller et al.  <cit>  in more detail, and to compare it to the expression of single-copy genes. in hr6b knockout spermatocytes, compared to wild type spermatocytes, we observed a significant increase in the average expression level of x-linked multicopy genes, but not of single-copy genes  . for the knockout round spermatids, also compared to wild type, the results indicate that there might be a small increase  in the average expression level of both the single-copy and multicopy x-linked genes . surprisingly, we found that the average expression level of x chromosomal single-copy genes in spermatids, of both knockout and wild type, was comparable to the average expression level from autosomes. in the data set presented in figure 7a, all genes that have an expression level of less than  <dig> in all  <dig> of the spermatocyte and spermatid fractions were removed. we also observed a marked recovery of x-linked gene expression in spermatids when these criteria were used to calculate the average expression per chromosome . this approach reveals that 36% of the single-copy genes  are re-expressed or first expressed in round spermatids, and can reach levels of transcription that are comparable to what is observed on average for genes expressed from autosomes. hence, the relatively low average x-linked gene expression level in round spermatids that is observed when all genes are included is mainly due to the fact that many genes have a very low expression level. from the dataset described by namekawa et al.  <cit> , that was also analysed by mueller at al.  <cit> ,  <dig> x-linked genes show expression above the arbitrary threshold of  <dig> in at least  <dig> out of the four spermatocyte and spermatid samples. when we compared the average expression of this set of genes with the average expression from autosomes  in spermatids, we observed that the average expression levels of x-linked single-copy and autosomal genes in spermatids were almost similar , in accordance with the analysis of our own microarray data.

single-copy x-linked genes that are spermatid-specific in wild type testis, are prematurely expressed in hr6b knockout spermatocytes
to further investigate the effect of loss of hr6b on gene expression from the x chromosome, we analysed the x-linked genes as divided in subgroups by namekawa et al.  <cit> . they classified x-linked genes based on their expression at different points during spermatogenesis. of these,  <dig> genes , are repressed at pachytene and remain low in spermatids . a small subgroup of  <dig> pachytene-repressed genes  are reactivated in round spermatids , whereas  <dig> genes  are specifically expressed in spermatids   <cit> . we calculated the average expression levels of genes from these groups and compared the levels in wild type and hr6b knockout germ cell fractions. in accordance with the data described by namekawa et al  <cit> , we observed a low average expression level of group a genes in wild type spermatocytes and spermatids , and a clear increase in expression for group b genes in spermatids compared to spermatocytes . notably, the group a genes show postmeiotic induction of gene expression in the knockout, but not in wild type. in addition, the average expression level of group a and b genes showed a small increase in hr6b knockout spermatids compared to wild types . for the spermatid-specific group c genes, we observed premature induction of gene expression in hr6b knockout spermatocytes  . in addition, the average expression level of these genes was increased in knockout spermatids compared to wild type spermatids, although not statistically significant . the average expression of autosomal spermatid-specific genes is not different between wild type and hr6b knockout spermatocytes and spermatids .

upregulation of x-gfp protein expression in testes from hr6b knockout mice
we also analysed the upregulation of x chromosome gene transcription through a different approach, by asking if the expression of an x-linked transgene would also be dysregulated on the hr6b knockout background. for this, we made use of a mouse line that contains multiple copies of the gfp gene at a random location on the x chromosome  <cit> . using an antibody against gfp, we detected the protein on western blots  and testis sections  from wild type and hr6b knockout mice that both carried the gfp gene on the x chromosome. the level of gfp expression, normalized to the level of th2b, was clearly increased in a total testis extract from approximately 50-day-old hr6b knockout mice compared to age-matched heterozygote and wild type mice . immunohistochemical analyses showed some background staining in gfp-negative hr6b+/+ and hr6b-/- mouse testis, but the x-linked gfp gene is clearly specifically expressed only in spermatogonia of wild type testis, and not during later stages of spermatogenesis. however, on the hr6b knockout background, gfp was also detected in spermatocytes and spermatids .

hr6b is not required for h2a ubiquitylation together with ubr <dig> at the xy body
very recently, an et al.  <cit>  reported that the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase ubr <dig>  that complexes with hr6a and hr6b, is required for h2ak <dig> ubiquitylation in mouse testis  <cit> . in addition, they observed specific upregulation of x- and y-linked genes in ubr <dig> knockout testes, and provided immunofluorescent data that indicate that msci does not occur. in contrast, lu et al.  <cit>  showed, even more recently, that the ubiquitin ligase rnf <dig> is required for h2a and h2b ubiquitylation during spermatogenesis, and lack of h2ak <dig> ubiquitylation on the xy body did not interfere with msci in their mouse model. in hr6b knockout spermatocytes, we have shown that the level and localization pattern of ubiquitylated h2ak <dig> are normal, and the initiation of msci also occurs normally in hr6b knockout germ cells  <cit> . in addition, aberrations in xy body chromatin structure of hr6b knockout spermatocytes start to become apparent at the developmental stage when h2ak <dig> ubiquitylation is already almost lost from the xy body in wild type spermatocytes. the overall level of h2a ubiquitylation drastically increases as pachytene progresses in both wild type and hr6b knockout spermatocytes . in the ubr <dig> knockout, the ubr2-dependent functions of both hr6a and hr6b might be impaired, whereas we have investigated the effect of loss of hr6b. however, in view of the fact that expression of the x-linked hr6a gene is repressed in spermatocytes  <cit> , and our observations on the defective maintenance of msci in hr6b knockout spermatocytes and spermatids, we anticipated a discrepancy between our results and those reported by an et al.  <cit> . in addition, their data do not match the recent findings of lu et al  <cit> . to study this, we analysed the publicly available microarray gene expression data of wild type and ubr <dig> knockout testes, isolated at postnatal day  <dig> . we found that, compared to the number of upregulated x- and y-chromosomal genes, many more autosomal genes show large differences in gene expression level between wild type and ubr <dig> knockout testis samples . in particular, we observed that spermatogenesis-specific autosomal genes that are normally first expressed in pachytene  <cit>  show a consistent reduced expression  in the knockout sample . this is in accordance with an arrest of spermatogenesis in ubr <dig> knockout mice in early pachytene  <cit> , so that pachytene spermatocytes  are relatively depleted from the knockout sample. the difference in germ cell composition of the wild type and ubr <dig> knockout testes provides an alternative explanation for the observed upregulation of x- and y-linked gene expression; the cells that have reached the stage in which msci occurs are present in much lower number in the knockout testes. also, h2ak <dig> ubiquitylation in ubr <dig> knockout spermatocytes may seem impaired due to the lack of mid- and late-pachytene cells in which the h2ak119ub <dig> levels are much higher than during early pachytene . from the above, we suggest that there is lack of evidence that ubiquitylation of h2a and msci are impaired in the ubr <dig> knockout. we hypothesize that, rather than h2a, a yet unknown ubiquitylation substrate of hr6b is required for the maintenance of msci. however, we do not exclude the possibility that this substrate is targeted via complex formation between hr6b and ubr <dig> 

expression of pachytene-induced spermatogenesis genes at postnatal day  <dig> and day  <dig> of testis development  <cit> , and at postnatal day  <dig> in wild type and ubr <dig> knockout testis  <cit> . the ratios of the log <dig> values of gene expression in total testis between day  <dig> and day  <dig> of wild type and between ubr <dig> knockout and wild type testes are shown. the bottom row shows the average log <dig> values of the ratios between day  <dig> and day  <dig> and between wild type and ubr <dig> knockout testes.

discussion
the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes hr6a and hr6b perform essential functions, as evidenced by the observation that double knockout embryonic stem cells cannot be obtained  <cit> . in hr6b knockout testes, progression of spermatogenesis is severely affected, and hr6b most likely performs multiple functions at different steps of spermatogenesis  <cit> . the aberrant structure of the sc in late spermatocytes and the increased frequency of meiotic recombination in hr6b knockout spermatocytes  <cit>  indicate that hr6b might regulate chromatin structure. herein, we have analysed hr6a/b localization during male meiotic prophase and performed global gene expression analyses to obtain more insight into the effects of hr6b-deficiency on gene expression, in particular of x- and y- encoded genes in spermatocytes and spermatids. despite the clear aberrations in chromatin structure in hr6b knockout spermatocytes, we observed very few significant changes in mrna expression in these cells. this indicates that the aberrations in sc structure and meiotic recombination are most likely due to loss of direct effects of hr6b at the protein level, without robust changes in gene expression. we have previously suggested that the increased meiotic recombination frequency upon loss of hr6b could be caused by a more open chromatin structure, allowing spo <dig> to cut at more sites  <cit> . if this is so, this open chromatin structure does not lead to a significant global increase in gene expression in hr6b knockout spermatocytes.

hr6b prevents premature expression of postmeiotic x and y-linked genes in spermatocytes
the only significantly upregulated gene in spermatocytes is the x-linked spindlin-like multicopy gene. of the  <dig> copies of this gene that localize to the x-chromosome, only  <dig> contain an open reading frame of  <dig> aa. the other copies encode smaller open reading frames of variable length. the y-linked copies; the ssty genes, were also found to be more highly expressed in knockout spermatocytes compared to controls, but the effect was less pronounced. it is not known whether the spindlin-like genes are actually male fertility genes and if the spindlin-like proteins have a function. when we grouped all known x-linked multicopy genes and analysed their expression levels on the array, we found that the whole group of x-linked spermatid-specific multicopy genes showed premature expression in spermatocytes. in addition, when we grouped the x-chromosomal single-copy genes based on their expression pattern , we found that also the group of single-copy x-linked genes --that are normally spermatid-specific-- show premature induction of their expression. based on the observed increased h3k4me <dig> level on the xy body in late spermatocytes  <cit> , we suggest that this premature induction of x-linked gene transcription occurs in diplotene spermatocytes.

in pachytene and early diplotene spermatocytes, phosphorylated hr6b protein is enriched on the xy body. phosphorylated hr6b may represent the active fraction of the enzyme, since mutation of the analogous site in rad6p in yeast  affects cell growth, h2b ubiquitylation and telomeric silencing  <cit> . in yeast, h2b ubiquitylation facilitates methylation of h3k <dig> and h3k <dig>  <cit> . h3k4me <dig> and h3k79me <dig> are enriched on active chromatin in yeast and mammalian cells  <cit> . the overall level of h2b ubiquitylation observed on western blots was found to be normal in hr6b knockout spermatocytes  <cit> , and the nuclear h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> immunostaining signal was not reduced by loss of hr6b. in fact, h3k4me <dig> was even increased on xy chromatin from diplotene onwards in hr6b knockout spermatocytes, compared to wild type controls  <cit> . this indicates that h2b might not be a primary target for hr6b on the xy body. however, ubiquitylated h2b most likely also perform functions independent of h <dig> methylation  <cit> , including possible direct repression of gene expression  <cit> . recently, it has been shown that h2b ubiquitylation stabilizes nucleosomes, and this may directly help to repress transcription at certain sites  <cit> . indeed, the repressed proto-oncogenes regulated by rnf <dig>  display "closed" chromatin structure and yet are highly enriched with both ubiquitinated h2b and h3k4me <dig>  <cit> . based on these observations, h2b ubiquitylation might function to maintain msci, in a direct manner, through stabilization of nucleosomal structure, thereby inhibiting access of transcriptional activators to the dna.

phosphorylated hr6b functions in the regulation of major satellite transcription through local effects on chromatin structure
phosphorylated hr6b is also temporarily enriched on centromeric chromatin of pachytene spermatocytes, and h3k9me <dig> is decreased in centromeric regions of hr6b knockout diplotene spermatocytes  <cit> . in accordance with these findings, we have now observed enhanced levels of major satellite repeat transcripts in hr6b knockout spermatocytes. this phenotype is reminiscent of the defective telomeric silencing in rad <dig> mutant yeast cells, which depends on h2b ubiquitylation and downstream h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> methylation by the histone methyltransferases set1p and dot1p, respectively  <cit> . in yeast, the roles of h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> methylation in silencing might be indirect, meaning that loss of these modifications leads to redistribution of silencing proteins, to regions that are normally active and enriched for h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> methylation, resulting in reduced repression of heterochromatin regions  <cit> . in an analogous manner, the enhanced transcription from major satellite repeats might be caused by a decrease in h2b ubiquitylation at specific sites, not detected as a measurable change in the overall level of h2b ubiquitylation, and a subsequent redistribution of silencing proteins away from the centromeric regions. however, the localization of hr6b at the centromeric regions in mouse spermatocytes indicates that hr6b might have a direct effect on the local chromatin structure, perhaps also through ubiquitylation of h2b, but at silenced regions, leading to enhanced stability of nucleosomes, and directly helping to maintain repression by preventing access of activation factors to the dna  <cit> .

hr6b deficiency has a dramatic effect on overall gene expression in round spermatids
spermatocytes and spermatids of wild type testis contain about equal levels of hr6b  <cit> . however, using immunocytochemistry, clear localization of hr6b to the chromatin was observed only in spermatocytes. this indicates that hr6b may localize mainly in the cytoplasm in spermatids, or that it is less tightly attached to the chromatin in postmeiotic cells. the dramatic effect on the overall gene expression pattern indicates that postmeiotic spermatid development is severely dysregulated. we analysed samples of the isolated cell fractions by hematoxilin-eosin staining before rna isolation to verify the purity of the cells , and observed no morphological differences between the wild type and knockout fractions. the large overall effect on gene expression may have several causes. it might be envisioned that defects that already occur in spermatocytes affect gene expression later, in spermatids. lack of ubiquitylation of critical substrates in spermatocytes and/or spermatids may gradually dysregulate many cellular processes that finally also affect gene expression. lack of h2b ubiquitylation in spermatids could also be one of the causative factors in the observed phenotype. however, we have not been able to detect any ubiquitylated histone fraction in highly purified round spermatids  <cit> . this may at least in part be due to de-ubiquitylation occurring during spermatid purification  <cit> . if reduced h2b ubiquitylation in hr6b knockout round spermatids causes global gene repression, it is to be expected that h3k <dig> methylation would also be reduced, and this has not been observed  <cit> . this argues against a critical involvement of hr6b-induced h2b ubiquitylation during round spermatid development, although it is not excluded that h2b ubiquitylation might be affected at certain local sites. lu et al  <cit>  reported very recently that the ubiquitin ligase rnf <dig> mediates h2a and h2b ubiquitylation during spermatogenesis. during spermatid elongation, lack of h2a and h2b ubiquitylation in rnf <dig> knockout spermatids prevents h <dig> hyperacetylation, and thereby blocks removal of histones  <cit> . in wild type mouse testis, h <dig> hyperacetylation precedes the histone-to-protamine transition that is required to compact and protect the genome in the small sperm head  <cit> . previously, we have shown that increased h2a ubiquitylation precedes the histone-to-protamine transition, and in hr6b knockout elongating spermatids, h2a ubiquitylation appears normal  <cit> . in addition, the histones are removed, as evidenced from the fact that transition proteins accumulate in elongating hr6b knockout spermatids  <cit> . based on these observations, it appears unlikely that hr6b acts together with rnf <dig> to ubiquitylated h2a and h2b during spermatid elongation. however, it cannot be excluded that rnf <dig> also interacts with hr6a, which is postmeiotically induced  <cit> , and this may allow rnf <dig> to ubiquitylate histones in hr6b knockout mouse testis.

hr6b deficiency leads to global de-repression of x chromosome transcription in round spermatids
during postmeiotic spermatid development, the sex chromosomes are still marked by the presence of silencing proteins, and a low level of cot-repeat rna fish signal  <cit> . this indicates that there is an overall repression of gene expression from these chromosomes. indeed, the average gene expression level from the x chromosome is still much lower compared to autosomes in spermatids  <cit> . however, if genes with expression below  <dig> are excluded from the analyses, the average expression level of x-linked and autosomal genes in spermatids is similar. this indicates that the x-linked single-copy genes that are expressed, can be expressed at normal levels, despite the fact that the x chromosome is generally enriched for heterochromatin markers. the x-linked multi-copy genes have an average expression level that is even higher . in hr6b knockout spermatids, we found a somewhat higher expression for x-linked single and multi-copy genes compared to wild type spermatids, and the walking average of gene expression along the x chromosome is higher all along the chromosome. this indicates that the role of hr6b in repression of postmeiotic sex chromosome-linked gene transcription is general and global, consistent with the observed overall increase in h3k4me <dig> levels on x and y chromatin in spermatids that was previously observed  <cit> .

apart from hr6b, one other gene, named sly, was recently shown to regulate postmeiotic sex chromosome inactivation. this is a multicopy y-linked gene that is specifically induced during postmeiotic spermatid development. coquet et al.  <cit> , knocked down sly and found specific derepression of sex chromosome-linked gene transcription. the expression of some autosomal genes was also altered, but the majority of differentially expressed genes was x-linked. hr6b has a more global effect on gene expression, involving up and downregulation of many autosomal genes. in addition, it specifically represses x- and y-linked gene transcription. the number of x- and y-linked genes that is differentially expressed in sly knockdown and hr6b knockout spermatids is comparable. direct comparison of the datasets is difficult because different array platforms were used. however manual comparison revealed that approximately 20- <dig> x- or y-linked genes are upregulated in both models. deficiency for sly leads to decreased levels of h3k9me <dig> on x and y chromatin in spermatids  <cit> . in hr6b knockout spermatids, such a decrease has not been observed. instead, we found increased h3k4me <dig> on x and y  <cit> . in addition, hr6a and hr6b are not differentially expressed in the sly knockdown spermatids  <cit> . together, these data indicate that hr6b and sly might act on postmeiotic sex-linked gene transcription via independent mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
although hr6b is required for several aspects of chromatin dynamics through the male meiotic prophase, the overall gene expression is hardly affected in hr6b knockout spermatocytes. still, single-copy and multicopy x-linked postmeiotic genes are expressed prematurely in hr6b knockout spermatocytes. in addition, hr6b represses major satellite repeat transcription, a function reminiscent of the role of rad <dig> in telomeric silencing in yeast.

in hr6b knockout spermatids, 30% of the annotated genes is differentially expressed, and multiple functional pathways are affected to a similar extent, indicating gross overall dysregulation of gene transcription. in wild type spermatids, single-copy postmeiotic x-linked genes reach expression levels that are comparable to that of autosomal genes. this indicates that approximately 20% of gene promoters on the x chromosome can be normally activated, despite the presence of heterochromatin markers originating from msci. previously, rna polymerase ii mediated gene transcription of mirnas has also been reported in spermatocytes as well as spermatids  <cit> . we suggest that the overall repressed conformation of the sex chromosomal chromatin, both in spermatocytes and spermatids, does not interfere with access of the transcription machinery to specific genes. this is consistent with the fact the dapi staining of the xy body and of pmsc is not as dense as for example the dapi staining of centromeric chromatin.

lack of hr6b, in association with global upregulation of h3k4me <dig>  leads to a global upregulation of x chromosomal gene expression in spermatids,. the critical ubiquitylation substrate for hr6b at the xy body and pmsc is not known. the e3s ubr <dig> and rad <dig> both interact with hr6a/b, and also accumulate at the xy body. for the bre <dig> homologs, rnf <dig> and rnf <dig>  the localization in meiotic cells is not known. either one of these e3s, or an unknown e <dig>  may be involved in targeting a chromatin component for ubiquitylation by hr6b to maintain sex chromosome silencing in spermatocytes and spermatids.
