BACKGROUND
proteins that selectively transport water across the membranes of cells are recognized as important in normal functioning of the body systems of vertebrates. these homologous proteins are collectively referred to as aquaporins and include a subset called aquaglyceroporins that are able to transport glycerol, urea and other small solutes in addition to water  <cit> . there are  <dig> known mammalian aquaporins . these aquaporins vary in tissue and developmental expression across mammalian species and unexpected cellular roles for the aquaporins beyond transmembrane water transport have been identified  <cit> . however, the cellular and molecular strategies for these roles are not completely understood. the water-only aquaporins are aqp <dig>  aqp <dig>  aqp <dig>  aqp <dig>  aqp <dig>  aqp <dig> and aqp <dig>  while aquaglyceroporins are aqp <dig>  aqp <dig>  aqp <dig> and aqp <dig>  <cit> . the transport specificities and roles of aqp <dig> and aqp <dig> in health and disease are not completely described  <cit> . aquaporins typically have six transmembrane regions and five loops  with two characteristic asparagine-proline-alanine  motifs in loops b and e   <cit> . based on the number of citations in pubmed, avian aquaporins have been poorly investigated compared to those of human, mouse and rat  <cit> .

the domesticated chicken gallus gallus is the premier avian model for biological research  <cit> . furthermore, the publication of the chicken genome and availability of large-scale gene expression data presents new opportunities to compare the expression of avian and mammalian aquaporin genes. mammalian aquaporins function in diverse biological processes including development of lens, inner ear, teeth and oral facial tissues; maintenance of sperm motility; synthesis and secretion of milk; and urine concentration. in addition, malfunction of mammalian aquaporins have been implicated in diverse disease processes such as altered fat metabolism, brain edema, cancer, congenital cataract, dry mouth, dry skin, infertility, hearing loss, nephrogenic diabetes, renal failure, and wet lung syndrome  <cit> . this broad range of pathologies linked to altered aquaporin expression has further supported the potential of aquaporins as drug targets for water-transport related disorders  <cit> .

apart from transmembrane/epithelial water transport, recently suggested unexpected cellular roles of mammalian aquaporins include cell migration, cell volume regulation, mitochondria metabolism, neural signal transduction, renal glycerol clearance and vesicular swelling  <cit> . the co-expression of several members of the aquaporin gene family in the same tissue such as small intestine  <cit>  makes it difficult to determine their individual role apart from trans-epithelial water transport. it is not clear whether alternative transcription/splicing of an aquaporin gene to produce more than one isoform contributes to these unexpected cellular roles. mice with deficient or mutated aquaporin are currently used as models to study novel cellular roles of human aquaporins  <cit> . there is an increasing need to have alternative non-mammalian models for aquaporin function in humans  <cit> . the chick optic tectum has been used to investigate the role of aqp <dig> in blood brain barrier development  <cit> . furthermore, in chick lens development, aqp <dig> interacts with lens-fiber gap junctions during lens development  <cit> .

there are a limited numbers of reports that have compared the body site expression of chicken and mammalian aquaporins. comparison of nucleotide sequences of chicken aqp <dig>  aqp <dig> and aqp <dig> to their rat and human orthologs has revealed an overall identity of 75â€“90% and similarity in tissue distribution  <cit> . aqp <dig> has not been shown to be expressed in mammalian kidney, but recently found expressed in young chicken kidney  <cit> . in addition, water-deprivation in early development of rodents and chicken results in upregulation of the kidney aqp <dig>  <cit> . the distribution of aqp <dig> in the circumventricular organs of chicken and rat brains have been compared  <cit> . taken together, the identification of aquaporins that share sequence similarity or are expressed in identical tissues in human and chicken could allow the further functional analyses of aquaporins in avian species.

the objectives of the investigation reported in this article were to  determine the impact of alternative transcription and speciation on functional motifs of aquaporin gene transcript models predicted from the genomes of human, mouse, rat and chicken; and  determine body sites common to human, mouse, rat and chicken with suggested aquaporin expression. we hypothesize that integrative analyses of protein sequences and body site expression of human, mouse, rat and chicken aquaporins has the potential to yield novel biological hypotheses about the unexpected cellular roles of aquaporins beyond transmembrane water transport. our high-throughput comparative sequence analysis revealed the potential impact of alternative transcription and speciation on the conservation of functional motifs in human, mouse, rat and chicken aquaporins. furthermore, by using controlled vocabulary of terms describing body sites in the unigene database, an integrated view of suggested tissue expression of aquaporins for these four organisms was generated.

the integrative analyses of protein sequences and tissue expression profiles presented in this article provides novel insights into the potential function of cysteine-rich aqp <dig> in the pathophysiology of autism and evidence for involvement of pancreas-expressed aqp <dig> in the pathology of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus infections. the investigation of aquaporin function in chicken could accelerate the discovery of novel knowledge on human aquaporins especially during early development.

RESULTS
comparison of predicted aquaporin transcripts from human, mouse, rat and chicken
in order to determine the impact of alternative transcription as well as speciation on the conservation of functional motifs in aquaporins, we first compiled the aquaporin types with entries in the entrez gene  <cit>  and ensembl  <cit>  genomic resources  for human, mouse, rat and chicken. this dataset provided the basis for comparative sequence analysis of the transcripts predicted in the ensembl genome resource. multiple sequence alignment was performed on each aquaporin type in which at least one mammalian and one chicken transcript were available. a total of  <dig> sequences were retrieved from the ensembl. multiple sequence alignments for each aquaporin type are available as additional file  <dig>  a summary of the number of transcripts examined for  <dig> aquaporin types and key observations from sequence alignment are presented in table  <dig>  the impact of alternative transcription and speciation of these vertebrate aquaporins on the conservation of the two water-transport motifs is summarized in table  <dig>  we further describe below the results obtained for aqp <dig>  aqp <dig>  aqp <dig> and aqp <dig> 

*ensembl identifiers obtained had a total of  <dig> numerals with the appropriate number of zeros as padding. furthermore, the identifiers were preceded by ensg, ensmusg, ensrnog, and ensgal are for human, mouse, rat and chicken genes respectively. the isoform of human aqp <dig> used for analysis was aquaporin 12b.

*additional file  <dig> contains the multiple sequence alignment for aqp <dig> to aqp <dig>  ensembl identifiers preceded by enst, ensmust, ensrnot, and ensgalt are for human, mouse, rat and chicken transcripts respectively.

three human transcripts were retrieved for aqp <dig> and one each for mouse, rat and chicken from the ensembl . the protein isoform from human aqp <dig> transcript enst <dig> lacked the first  <dig> amino acids present in the other isoforms. this region contained the yrll motif known to be important for basolateral sorting in epithelial cells  <cit> . the yrll motif was replaced by a nklv motif in the only chicken isoform obtained from transcript ensgalt <dig>  the first npa motif was conserved in all the aqp <dig> isoforms while the second npa motif was absent in two human aqp <dig> isoform sequences . the impact of alternative transcription and speciation is illustrated by protein features predicted for the three human aqp <dig> transcripts and one chicken aqp transcript . note the difference in number of transmembrane helices predicted for the human transcripts. interestingly, the chicken transcript lacks a prediction for signal peptide. this observation led us to further analyze the ensembl generated pairwise sequence alignments of the chicken aqp <dig> with other vertebrate aqp <dig> showing 1-to- <dig> ortholog prediction. the aqp <dig>  of the platypus  had a ykll motif aligned to the nklv motif of the chicken sequence .

aqp <dig> was the only aquaporin type in which the four organisms had at least two transcripts. multiple sequence alignment of the amino acid sequences from the  <dig> transcripts and construction of phylogenetic tree revealed two classes of transcripts . the two rat transcripts  clustered with a human transcript  and a mouse transcript . in the case of the remaining  <dig> aqp <dig> transcripts, the chicken and mouse protein sequences were clustered with human transcript enst <dig> 

in the case of aqp <dig>  the first water transporting motif was atypical  in all the isoforms examined. only three protein isoforms from transcripts ensrnot <dig>  ensmust <dig> and enst <dig> contained the second npa motif. aqp <dig> sequences had a high number of cysteine residues compared to other aquaporin types including a triplet ccc present in the n-terminal of protein sequences produced by transcripts ensmust <dig>  ensmust <dig> and enst <dig>  the two rat sequences had a cyc motif while chicken had a cac motif. cysteine residues are known to interact with sulfhydryl-reactive metals such as mercury, cadmium, lead, and arsenic  <cit> . a total of five transcripts for aqp <dig> were retrieved for the four species. the protein sequence for one of the human transcripts  lacked the first npa-like motif  present in the other sequences. all contained the second npa motif.

body site expression profiles for human, mouse, rat and chicken aquaporins
a total of  <dig> unigene aquaporin entries from human , mouse , rat  and chicken  were identified has having suggested expression in at least one of  <dig> body sites based on expressed sequence tags  counts . a total of  <dig> binary signatures described the expression of aquaporins from the organisms compared. the visualized matrix of signatures is presented in figure  <dig>  furthermore,  <dig> body sites  were identified in which both chicken and mammalian aquaporins were expressed. the brain had the highest count for aquaporin expression. all four organisms expressed aqp <dig>  aqp <dig> and aqp <dig> in the brain. there was evidence of expression of aqp <dig> in the intestine, pancreas, stomach, and tongue as well as expression in the pancreas for all species except rat . we mapped chicken aquaporins to body sites in order to prioritize them for further functional analysis .

discussion
aquaporin cell surface proteins are emerging as important proteins beyond water transport  <cit> . however, the molecular, cellular and evolutionary basis for these novel roles are not completely known. our high-throughput comparative sequence analysis revealed the impact of alternative transcription and speciation on the conservation of functional motifs in human, mouse, rat and chicken aquaporins. furthermore, by using a controlled vocabulary of terms describing body sites in the unigene database, an integrated view of suggested tissue expression of aquaporins in these four organisms was generated . we were unable to retrieve information from the ensembl database on chicken aqp <dig> and aqp <dig>  although chicken aqp <dig>  has been studied in the context of early development of lens fiber and its association with gap junction proteins  <cit> . the predicted chicken aqp <dig> was annotated as aqp2-like. the annotation of aqp <dig>  aqp <dig> and aqp <dig> from the chicken genome warrants further investigation.

alternate splicing of mrna as a means of generating protein diversity can occur by exon skipping  <cit> . all the  <dig> aquaporins transcripts analyzed were multi-exon transcripts and could be subject to alternative splicing with impact on protein function. for the nine aquaporin types compared, our sequence alignments uncovered aquaporin isoforms that lacked one of the two water-transport motifs . we hypothesize that isoforms lacking one of the two npa or npa-like motifs characteristic will have impaired or abolished water transport function. they are also candidates for investigating roles other than water function. another mechanism for variation that can impact function of aquaporins is single nucleotide polymorphisms . previous work has demonstrated that novel genetic variants of aqp <dig> resulting from single nucleotide polymorphisms  showed reduced water permeability  <cit> . we observed from the ensembl database  that a total of  <dig> reference snps were mapped to the following chicken aquaporins: aqp <dig>  aqp <dig>  aqp <dig>  aqp <dig> and aqp <dig>  as the chicken genome become further characterized for polymorphisms, it may become possible to gain insights into impact of snp variation on aquaporin function and organism phenotype.

most proteins that target the plasma membrane contain signals within their cytoplasmic termini that permit their recruitment into endocytic vesicles, which in turn facilitates their selective compartmentalization in the apical or basolateral membranes selectively  <cit> . we were interested in identifying avian protein isoforms in which the functional motifs were different from mammalian aquaporin isoforms. we have previously investigated the compartmentalization of aqp <dig> and aqp <dig> in the human intestine in which we observed that the basolateral sorting motif "yrll" is present in aqp <dig> but absent in aqp <dig>  <cit> . based on the unigene suggested expression profiles there was no suggestion for the expression of chicken aqp <dig> in the intestine. furthermore, the signal peptide for targeting was not predicted for chicken aqp <dig> in the ensembl resource . tissue expression for this chicken aqp <dig> was suggested for head, liver, and ovary. comparative sequence analysis provided evidence that chicken aqp <dig> lacks the yrll motif  suggesting that it may not be targeted to the basolateral membrane of the intestine. the multiple sequence alignment of the aqp <dig> protein sequences from the four organisms revealed that the amino acids immediately before and after the yrll and nklv motifs were conserved .

according to the proteus  tool  <cit> , the nklv protein signature is a short linear significant signature in termini of proteins with a corresponding gene ontology cellular component of "extracellular". based on alignments available at the ensembl resource  <cit>  for aqp <dig> from fish  and an amphibian , the ancestral motifs of the sorting motifs found in human may be nkll or nmlm . thus, the presence of the amino acid tyrosine  in this sorting tetrapeptide in the platypus suggests the point in the evolution of aqp <dig> where the asparagine residue was replaced by the critical tyrosine required for sorting function  <cit> . the genome of o. anatinus has been proposed has useful for informing human genome sequence and critical link to understanding the differences between avian and mammalian genomes  <cit> . these observations provide novel evolutionarily insights into the localization signals encoded in the termini of aqp <dig> 

we have used a binary encoding integration strategy to gain a comprehensive view of suggested tissue expression of aquaporins for four organisms. higher-order patterns in a binary vector space that encodes the presence  or absence  of feature of interest is an approach for integrating genome-wide numerical datasets  <cit> . several advantages offered by the binary integration of high-throughput gene expression data include computational efficiency and noise resilience  <cit> . our matrix revealed that aqp <dig>  in addition to aqp <dig> and aqp <dig> were expressed in the brain of all the four organisms. these three aquaporin types are candidates for comparative experimental investigation of aquaporin in brain function. in addition, the analysis delivered a set of body sites in which there was evidence of expression of at least one mammalian aquaporin and chicken aquaporin.

the functions of aqp <dig> and aqp <dig> in vertebrate physiology are not completely understood  <cit> . we observed that aqp <dig> had the highest number of cysteine residues compared to other aquaporins. aqp <dig> is expressed in the purkinje cells of the brain cerebellar  <cit> , a site that have been implicated in the pathophysiology of autism  <cit> . exposure of chick embryo to the environmental metal pollutant methylmercury led to reduction in the number of purkinje cells  <cit> . furthermore, there were adverse post-natal behavioral, morphological and biochemical consequences. mercury ions are known to regulate aquaporin function by interacting with cysteine residues  <cit> . interestingly, the first pore forming motif of aqp <dig> found in loop b has a motif of npc instead of the npa. however, the second motif is npa consistent with other aqps. aqp <dig> is the only human aquaporin with the tri-cysteine  motif. these observations led us to hypothesize that aqp <dig> may be a target in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders like autism. we are currently studying the specificity and affinity of a range of cations to further understand the interaction of cations with aquaporins in the function of the central nervous system. with the availability of the chicken genome, the chick embryo has the potential to serve as an important model for the study of the development of neurodegenerative disorders  <cit> .

in the case of aqp <dig>  there was suggested expression in the pancreas of human, mouse and chicken  with chicken having the highest expression level. aqp <dig> is localized intracellularly in the pancreatic acinar cells, the site for synthesis of digestive enzymes  <cit> . histopathological studies have confirmed that the highly pathogenic h5n <dig> virus that causes avian influenza in chicken and other avian species causes multifocal necrosis in the pancreatic acinar cells suggesting that the effect of avian influenza on the function of aqp <dig> warrants further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that the chicken genome combined with a comprehensive controlled vocabulary-facilitated integration of unigene suggested body site expression can drive generation of hypotheses related to the function of avian and mammalian aquaporins. we describe the generation of hypotheses related to  the impact of alternative transcription and speciation on the conservation of functional motifs in human, mouse, rat and chicken aquaporins;  identification of the emergence of basolateral targeting in mammalian species  possibility of cysteine-rich aqp <dig> as target in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders; and  impact on the function of pancreas-expressed aqp <dig> during pancreatotropic necrosis associated with avian influenza virus infection.
