BACKGROUND
one of the debated ecological risks associated with the commercial cultivation of genetically modified crop varieties is the possibility of introgression of transgenes from crops to their wild relatives through hybridization. possible adverse consequences of introgression would be an increase in the weediness of the wild relatives in agricultural areas, genetic erosion in wild relatives, or the invasion of new habitats by crop-wild transgenic lineages  <cit> . where crops and their compatible wild relatives coexist, hybridization between the two is likely  <cit> . therefore, the outcome of hybridization between crops and their wild relatives has been the subject of several research studies, using either transgenic or conventional crop varieties  <cit> .

the net effect of crop-wild hybridization in terms of fitness may be negative, for instance if crop genes reduce the competitive ability under natural conditions, or positive, if hybrids inherit combinations of additive positive traits from the crop and the wild parents  <cit> . if hybrids are viable and fertile, hybridization can result in a swarm of hybrids in which crop and wild genomes interactively define the hybrid phenotypes. from the f <dig> progeny onwards, crop alleles can be fixed through selfing or through backcrossing to the wild parent followed by selfing, or through combinations of these, depending on the breeding system of the species. natural selection will purge maladapted genotypes, leaving those genotypes with similar or higher net fitness as the wild parent in the natural habitat of the wild taxon, or with broadened adaptation as a result of transgressive segregation  <cit> .

initially, any crop gene in a hybrid plant will be in a chromosome segment comprising the gene itself and other crop genes linked with it, and the fitness effect will depend on the overall effect of the whole chromosome segment  <cit> . in subsequent generations, these haplotypes will gradually be broken up through recombination, but loci at short genetic distances from each other may remain linked for many generations  <cit> . in the course of crop allele fixation, a gene that confers a selective advantage may be introgressed, but it will do so along with other loci tightly linked to it, which may also have an effect on fitness. a gene may also be selected against, if it is linked to a deleterious gene  <cit> . it is within such a context that the dynamics of the process of introgression from crops to wild relatives constitute a baseline for understanding the effects of transgene escape and fixation into wild taxa  <cit> .

we have initiated a study in which we follow the genetic process of introgression from cultivated lettuce  to its wild relative prickly lettuce . the two species readily hybridize, resulting in viable and fertile hybrids  <cit> , hence representing a typical crop-weed complex. despite the limited outcrossing rate in the two species  <cit> , through population-genetic means we have identified crop-wild hybrid plants among natural populations of l. serriola which are expected to be a result of spontaneous gene flow between the two species  <cit> .

in a previous study we have explored the genetic basis of hybrid vigour in an f <dig> population resulting from a synthetic cross between cultivated l. serriola and l. sativa . we mapped qtls for plant vigour, which co-localized in a small number of chromosome regions, with genetic variation explained by both additive main effect and epistatic qtl effect. after hybridization, the crop genomic segments will be established in the wild background or eliminated by selection either through selfing of the hybrids or through backcrossing to the predominant wild plants, or a combination of the two processes. selfing generations after a single hybridization event between the crop and the wild parents are characterized by crop genomic segments constituting an average of 50% of the hybrid genome. in contrast, every backcross to the wild parent decreases the crop genome content by half, while the crop genome segments become smaller through recombination . in this way, crop segments that contribute to the vigour and fitness of the hybrids get introgressed with a decreasing number of hitchhiking loci with each backcross generation. therefore, the fitness effects of a transgene in the context of its genomic location will differ in the selfing and backcrossing pathways.

studies on crop-wild hybrids are usually conducted on selfing generations of the hybrids  <cit>  and rarely on backcross populations  <cit> , hence overlooking a significant pathway in the crop-to-wild introgression process. in this study we follow up the crop-weed complex of l. sativa and l. serriola in a marker-assisted introgression study, and we focus on bc <dig> and bc <dig> generations in which l. serriola was the recurrent parent, hence mimicking the introgression process from crops to wild relatives through repeated backcrosses with wild populations. abiotic stresses constitute major selection factors that impact the frequency of specific crop segments in subsequent generations  <cit> . moreover, considerable effort is presently put into developing transgenic varieties capable of withstanding abiotic stress factors  <cit> . therefore, the two hybrid populations were tested under three abiotic stress conditions, namely drought, salinity and nutrient deficiency. we aimed at obtaining answers to the following questions:  do the backcross generations exhibit transgressive segregation for vigour?  are the vigour qtl regions that were identified in the selfing pathway  also detected in the backcross populations?  how does the contribution of crop alleles to the vigour of the hybrids change with the increasing proportion of wild genetic background?

RESULTS
phenotypic variance among the hybrid families
backcrossing made the hybrid plants morphologically very similar to their wild parent, l. serriola. the bc1s <dig> and bc2s <dig> families showed a wide range of means for the vigour traits under stress and non-stress conditions . vigour depended on the backcross families and varied between the treatments in the two hybrid populations as revealed by the significance of gxe . some trait-treatment combinations, such as plant height under all the treatments and dry weight under control and drought conditions, showed transgressive segregation over the two parents . for all traits and in both backcross generations the mean of the wild parent l. serriola was lower than the maximum mean of the hybrid families. in spite of a second generation of backcrossing from bc <dig> to bc <dig>  for each trait-treatment combination individual bc1s <dig> and bc2s <dig> plants and families stood out that performed better than the two wild genotypes , indicating that the bc <dig> plants still contained crop genomic segments which contributed positively to their vigour.

 <dig> control-d: the control treatment of the drought experiment, control-sn: the control treatment of the salt-nutrient experiment

genetic variation as measured through the broad sense heritability of family means of the traits ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the bc <dig> experiments, showing that a substantial part of the phenotypic variation was due to genetic factors . in the drought experiment, heritability was lower in the drought treatment than in the control for all traits. in the salt-nutrient experiment, the heritability was lower in the salt and nutrient deficiency treatment than in the control for plant height, fresh weight and dry weight, but the heritability was higher for relative moisture content, with a greater difference in the nutrient deficiency treatment .

in the bc <dig> population, heritability of the traits among bc2s <dig> families ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , which is comparable to the range found in the bc <dig> population . also in line with the bc <dig> population, the heritability was lower in the drought treatment than in the control for all the traits in the bc <dig> population. in the salt-nutrient experiment, heritability was lower in the salt treatment than in the control for fresh weight and dry weight, while it was slightly higher than the control for plant height and relative moisture content. in the same experiment, heritability was considerably lower under nutrient deficiency conditions as compared to the control for plant height, with  <dig>  under control and  <dig>  under nutrient deficiency conditions.

allelic composition of the hybrids and linkage maps
bc <dig> individuals contained on average 26% of the crop genome with individual plants ranging from 11% to 39%. the population was characterized by long crop genomic segments in a heterozygous state which sometimes spanned all the markers of a whole linkage group . one additional backcross to the wild parent resulted in a reduction of the crop genome content to 14%, varying among bc <dig> individuals both in segment size and proportion, ranging from 3% to 29% .

the linkage maps, shown in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  consisted of nine linkage groups  that represented the nine chromosomes of lettuce  <cit> . the same marker order was obtained in the bc <dig> and bc <dig> populations. the bc <dig> map was made of  <dig> markers spanning a total length of  <dig> cm, while the bc <dig> map had  <dig> markers with a total length of  <dig> cm. individual linkage groups contained  <dig> to  <dig> snp markers, except lg <dig>  which had  <dig> markers. as mentioned in the qtl analysis subsection of materials and methods, virtual markers were added on the bc <dig> map to fill gaps stemming from the additional round of recombination for better qtl mapping results. these markers are underlined on the bc <dig> linkage map .

quantitative trait loci
twenty qtls associated with plant vigour were mapped in the bc <dig> population,  <dig> for plant height,  <dig> for fresh weight,  <dig> for dry weight and  <dig> for relative moisture content . the qtls were located on all linkage groups except lg <dig>  only three of these qtls had the same order of magnitude additive effect in all treatments. the remaining qtls were significantly affected by qtlxe.

 <dig> c-d: control treatment of the drought experiment; d: drought, c-sn: control treatment of the salt-nutrient experiment, n: nutrient deficiency, s: salt

qtls for plant height had an additive effect positive for the wild allele in the drought and salt treatments, and in the two control treatments. under nutrient deficiency, two of the plant height qtls had an additive effect positive for the wild allele, while three qtls for the same trait were positive for the crop allele, including two qtls  which had a positive effect for the wild allele in other treatments, hence showing opposite allelic effects from one treatment to another.

fresh weight qtls were inherited from the crop as three of the qtls for this trait showed a positive additive effect for the crop allele. dry weight qtls were inherited from both the crop and wild parent as three of the qtls for the trait had a positive additive effect for the crop allele, while one qtl for that trait showed a positive additive effect for the wild allele. relative moisture content qtls were inherited from both the crop and the wild parents. four of the qtls mapped for this trait had a positive additive effect for the crop allele, while the additive effect was positive for the wild allele for the remaining three qtls.

fewer qtls were mapped in the bc <dig> than in the bc <dig> population . thirteen qtls were mapped in bc <dig> for vigour-related traits. four of the qtls were significant in all the treatments with the same additive effect, hence having non-significant qtlxe effect, while the remaining nine were significantly affected by qtlxe.

two of the qtls for plant height had a positive additive effect for the wild allele and they were significant under the control treatment of the salt-nutrient experiment and under salt treatment. the other two had a positive additive effect for the crop allele. the three fresh weight qtls had a positive additive effect for the crop allele. for the dry weight qtls, one had a positive additive effect from the crop allele and the other one was positive for the wild allele. relative moisture content qtls were inherited from both the wild and the crop parent.

co-localization of qtl regions
qtl regions on lg <dig> and lg <dig> were the most important in the two populations as they comprised most of the qtls. four qtls were mapped on the same region on lg <dig> in the bc <dig> and bc <dig> populations, one for each of the measured vigour traits . the qtls for fresh weight and dry weight had the same allelic effect, which was positive for the crop allele under all the treatments. however, the plant height and relative moisture content qtls showed allelic specificity for treatments in the two populations, with a qtl showing a positive effect from one parent in one treatment and a positive effect for a different treatment from the other parent. on lg <dig>  four qtls were mapped around the same region in bc <dig> and the same region contained three qtls in bc <dig>  including two qtls that were common in the two populations. in total  <dig> qtls were common in the bc <dig> and bc <dig> populations on lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig>  and lg <dig>  additionally, a qtl region was found in both populations on lg <dig> but it contained qtls for different traits in the two populations.

qtl epistatic effects
qtl epistatic effects on the vigour traits were significant in the two hybrid populations and under stress and non-stress conditions. in the bc <dig> population epistasis was estimated for  <dig> qtl pairs and it explained  <dig> to 9% of the phenotypic variance per individual qtl pair and up to 23% per trait. nine qtl regions were used in the bc <dig> population, supplemented with  <dig> qtl regions that, on their own, were only significant in the bc <dig>  in order to increase the number of loci in the epistasis analysis. epistasis for these regions explained  <dig> to 11% of the phenotypic variance per qtl pair and up to 27% per trait . while interacting qtls for plant height had a higher mean for the crop-crop or wild-wild genotype combinations in the bc <dig> population, the highest mean for the same trait was associated with crop-wild genotype combinations in the bc <dig> population, showing the effect of the combination of qtls inherited from the two parents for that trait. the genotype combination of a wild allele at the two epistatic loci  was associated with the highest mean for  <dig> out of  <dig> qtl pairs in bc <dig> and  <dig> out of  <dig> qtl pairs in bc <dig>  indicating that the advantageous epistatic effect was mostly associated with the genotype combinations involving a crop allele at one of the two loci.

discussion
performance of crop-wild hybrid lines
studies on introgression of crop genes into wild relative genomes have shown that although the average fitness of the hybrids might be lower than the fitness of the wild relative, individual hybrid genotypes could have similar or better fitness than their wild parent, showing a potential for introgression of advantageous crop genes  <cit> . in our study, the bc1s <dig> and bc2s <dig> families revealed lines showing transgressive segregation for vigour in the control and stress treatments, indicating that two generations of backcrossing to the wild parent did not eliminate the effect of the crop segments. the occurrence of bc2s <dig> families that outperform the wild parent shows that if vigour traits positively correlate with fitness under natural conditions, crop genomic segments that confer improved vigour could be introgressed into the wild taxon, rendering it more vigorous under non-stress as well as under abiotic stress conditions.

qtl effects
backcrossing has been applied in plant breeding for fine-mapping of qtls and for the introgression of desired qtl alleles from wild donors into elite cultivars  <cit> . in crop-to-wild gene flow, repeated backcrossing to the wild parent might take place along with selfing as a result of the often much higher frequency of wild individuals compared to crop-wild hybrids. one of the direct consequences of repeated backcrossing to the wild species is the continuing decrease in crop genomic segments, both in size as they become successively shorter and in frequency as each plant has fewer segments. consequently, each backcrossing event is expected to reduce the detection power of qtl analysis  <cit> . consistently with this, we detected more qtls in the bc <dig> population than in the bc <dig> population for each of the considered vigour traits. however, despite the decreasing crop content, new qtls with an additive effect from the crop allele were detected in the backcross populations, including the bc <dig>  as compared to the f <dig>  which we have studied in earlier work . in the f <dig> study , plant height qtls in the f <dig> population were entirely inherited from the wild parent. in this study, two additional plant height qtls were mapped for the nutrient deficiency treatment  in the bc <dig> population with an additive effect from the crop. in the bc <dig> population we detected two more qtls for plant height  with the same allelic effect in all the treatments which was positive for the crop allele, showing that the contribution of the crop to plant vigour could be underestimated depending on the population studied.

common qtls in selfing and backcrossing hybrid generations
we found qtl regions related to vigour under control and three abiotic stress conditions, showing a diverse potential introgression mosaic with contributions of genomic segments from both crop and wild relative parents. many of these qtls co-localised, allowing to pinpoint introgression "hotspots". seven qtls were common between f <dig>  bc <dig> and bc <dig> populations on lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig>  three were common in at least two populations on lg <dig> and lg <dig>  and one qtl was found in very closely located regions in the backcross populations on lg <dig> . a common finding in plant breeding is that different qtls are detected in different mapping populations of the same cross. the differences could be attributed to statistical power, especially with a limited number of lines in the population , and to a combination of recessiveness and a skewed linkage map  <cit> . differences in detected qtls between populations has also been associated with changes in genetic variation between populations with further backcrossing associated with decreasing genetic variation and consequently resulting in decreasing qtl detection power  <cit> . in the present study, the qtls common to more than one hybrid generation were those with the greatest effects in terms of explained phenotypic variance per treatment and per trait, while the qtls with small effect were mostly mapped in one hybrid generation.

the positive sign shows a positive effect for the crop allele and the negative sign shown a positive effect for the wild allele

linkage groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were the most important in bc <dig> and bc <dig> populations as they showed regions that contained many and common qtls in the two populations. the same regions were important in the f <dig> population . despite the overlapping qtl regions across hybrid populations, some qtls showed treatment specificity per population. for instance, l-7- <dig> had a positive effect for the wild allele under nutrient deficiency conditions in the f <dig> population, but the same qtl region showed a positive effect for the crop allele under the same treatment in the bc <dig> population and it was not significant in the bc <dig> population. conversely, rmc-4- <dig> was consistent across populations and treatments with a positive allelic effect from the crop, though it was not significant in the salt treatment of the f <dig> population. such qtlxe interactions suggest that the regions might contain different treatment-specific genes which contribute to the vigour of the plants. moreover, qtls for different vigour traits were mapped in those same regions with opposite allelic effect. nevertheless, the involvement of the same regions in the vigour of the hybrids in three populations indicates that these regions will be under selection, either positive or negative, depending on the prevailing conditions.

epistasis
qtl epistatic effect was significant for several vigour traits in the two backcross populations. epistasis has been suggested as one of the major allelic interactions affecting fitness in self-pollinating species such as arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . epistatic qtl effects are expected to play a major role in selfing populations and to decline with further backcrossing as a result of decreasing genetic variation  <cit> . our results show that the vigour traits were affected by the epistatic effect of qtls under stress and non-stress conditions, and that positive epistatic effects were mostly associated with genotype combinations involving the crop alleles. qtl epistatic effect in bc <dig> and bc <dig> populations emphasizes the genetic importance of the crop genomic segments even after two backcrosses to the wild parent. importantly, the combination of beneficial epistatic and additive allelic effects from two parents at different loci in repulsion phase has been associated with the origin of transgressive segregation that leads to the creation of superior or even ecologically diverging phenotypes  <cit> . however, the fact that none of the qtl epistatic effects were detected in both populations makes the stability of the epistatic effect over generations questionable; in turn, this will make it difficult to predict the effect in further generations.

CONCLUSIONS
both in the bc <dig> and bc <dig>  lines were identified that performed equally or better than both the wild parental genotype and the additional wild genotype included in the experiments, indicating the occurrence of transgressive segregation in our hybrid populations. epistasis may be an important underlying factor and some positive epistatic effects of qtls were detected, mostly associated with crop alleles, but these were not universal across f <dig> and bc generations. knowledge of fitness effects of crop genomic blocks  may be put to use to control gene flow to natural populations, namely by inserting genes that one would prefer to keep contained, into genomic regions disadvantageous to the plant's performance in the field. although fewer qtls were detected in the bc <dig> than in the bc <dig> and there was also some variation in qtls between the f <dig> and the bc generations, many qtls were found to be in common between hybrid generations. among these, there were qtls for which the crop alleles were clearly disadvantageous to the plant's performance and qtls for which the crop alleles were advantageous. the latter genomic areas would not be advisable for inserting genes to be contained. it was also possible to identify "hotspots" of qtls, which would also better be avoided as they are clearly important to the plant's performance and mostly show advantageous as well as disadvantageous effects for the respective crop alleles. this study was carried out on plant vigour, based on the previous knowledge that lettuce crop-wild hybrids undergo selection at an early stage of growth  <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the first study on introgression that combines a qtl analysis approach with different stress treatments to address the process of introgression. although these experiments were conducted using a limited number of hybrid genotypes  and under greenhouse conditions, the results constitute a first, informative step towards understanding the potential for introgression of cultivated lettuce genomic segments into wild lettuce under abiotic stress conditions. future experiments should consider the whole life cycle of hybrid plants from seed germination to seed production under field conditions, as to include early and late plant vigour, natural selection and survival, and reproduction as well as a greater range of crop and wild genotypes.
