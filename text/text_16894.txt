BACKGROUND
gata4/5/ <dig> zinc finger-containing transcription factors are regulators of gene expression in multiple tissues derived from mesoderm and endoderm in vertebrate embryos and adults  <cit> . they are expressed in overlapping patterns and share domain structure and most of their biochemical activities, including dna binding site preference, raising a possibility of redundant function in vivo. genetic analyses of the roles of gata4/5/ <dig> genes in vertebrate development has so far implicated that individual factors have unique and shared roles. in the mouse gata <dig> initially plays an essential role in endodermal development and indirectly in early heart morphogenesis  <cit> . later roles of gata <dig> have been revealed by analysis of a non-null allele that blocks interaction with fog <dig> cofactor, by myocardial-specific null mutation, and by careful analysis of heterozygous null mice  <cit> . a role for gata <dig> in the mouse liver development was recently examined by tetraploid embryo complementation, and this work has indicated that gata <dig> is required for expansion of liver bud  <cit> . in zebrafish, knockdown of gata <dig> by specific morpholino oligonucleotides  has been shown to affect development of heart and liver precursors after their specification, in broad agreement with the results obtained in the mouse model  <cit> .

gata <dig> is indispensable for development of exrtraembryonic endoderm in the mouse, and also has later roles in the developing liver and heart, following their specification  <cit> . these findings on the roles of gata <dig> in the mouse are in good agreement with the results from xenopus and zebrafish models  <cit> .

the function of gata <dig> has been most extensively studied in the zebrafish embryo, where faust  mutants were found to display defects in heart and endoderm development  <cit> . the heart phenotypes of faust embryos include an almost complete loss of cardiac progenitors and morphological defects such as cardia bifida  <cit> . more recently a role of gata <dig> in zebrafish heart morphogenesis was confirmed by mos  <cit> . in contrast, targeting of the gata <dig> gene in the mouse was reported to have no consequences for embryonic development, suggesting that the role of gata <dig> in mammals may not be conserved  <cit> .

to improve our understanding of the roles played by gata <dig> and gata <dig> in early development of vertebrate embryos, we have analysed their function in xenopus embryos using a gene knockdown approach.

RESULTS
gata <dig> is a dosage-sensitive regulator of early heart and liver development
to assess the role of gata <dig> in xenopus development we first used a translation-blocking mo, g <dig>  this mo targets both gata <dig> pseudoalleles in xenopus laevis and gata <dig> mrna in diploid xenopus tropicalis . doses of  <dig> ng or greater per x. laevis embryo resulted in gastrulation defects and lethality by mid-neurula stages. therefore, to investigate the role of gata <dig> in heart and liver development doses of 5– <dig> ng/embryo were used. this dose of g <dig> mo was shown to specifically and effectively block translation of the injected tagged gata <dig> mrna .

the phenotypes of morphant tadpoles were scored at st. 35– <dig>  when morphogenesis of the beating heart is well advanced, and is characterised by the expansion of the walls of looped cardiac tube  <cit> . at this stage the adjacent liver primordium is visible as a distinct thickening in the anterior endoderm. at st. 35– <dig>  the cardiomyocyte differentiation-specific genes mlc <dig> and ctni, and liver-enriched genes for <dig> and hex are robustly expressed, and were used to visualise heart and liver development  <cit> .

injection of g <dig> mo in x. laevis embryos in both blastomeres at 2-cell stage or in presumptive anterior blastomeres at 4-cell stage caused a severe reduction in the size of heart and liver primordia , whilst posterior targeting of g5mo  or injection of two control mos at  <dig> ng/embryo has no obvious effect . g <dig> mo caused a similar heart phenotype in x. tropicalis embryos .

the most frequent phenotype caused by g5mo was an almost complete loss of cardiac and liver markers . the remaining morphants had a reduction of heart and liver primordia, and only rarely abnormal morphogenesis of the heart was observed.

our attempts to rescue gata <dig> morphants by injection of a wide range of gata <dig> mrna amounts proved inconclusive , most likely because overexpression of even small amounts of gata <dig> mrna causes a severe phenotype  <cit> ; data not shown). it is likely that a successful rescue requires the precise regulation of the amount, place and time of exogenous gata <dig> expression. we therefore wished to provide an additional line of evidence for the specificity of action of gata <dig> mos by downregulating gata <dig> in a way that would enable assessment of the status of endogenous gata <dig>  to achieve this, a splice site-blocking mo was used and its action was monitored by rt-pcr analyses of mrna. using genomic sequence available for x. tropicalis, a splice junction blocking mo  was designed which was predicted to cause in-frame skipping of exon  <dig>  this exon encodes the c-terminal zn finger . injection of g5sp mo caused an efficient and dose-dependent reduction in the level of the full-length gata <dig> mrna in x. tropicalis embryos . this mo also caused exon skipping in x. laevis , indicating conservation of intronic sequence at the exon/intron and intron/exon boundaries .

injection of g5sp mo in both x. laevis and x. tropicalis resulted in correct in-frame exon  <dig> skipping, as confirmed by sequencing of pcr products . the action of g5sp mo appeared to be specific for gata <dig>  since gata <dig> transcripts were not affected by any of the doses of this mo analysed . importantly, the phenotype observed following injection of the low-medium doses  was similar to the one produced by g <dig> mo, namely, severe heart and liver defects . furthermore, given that  <dig> ng of g5sp mo eliminated only approximately half of the full-length gata <dig> mrna , these results suggest that in our experiments with translation-blocking mo, only a partial downregulation of gata <dig> was achieved, allowing the morphants to reach tadpole stages. rt-pcr data suggest that doses of g5sp mo above  <dig> ng  result in skipping of the exon  <dig> in all gata <dig> transcripts in x. laevis  and cause severe gastrulation defects and death . in our earlier experiments with higher doses of the g <dig> mo  we observed similar phenotypes. taken together, this data indicate that higher doses of g5sp and g <dig> mos result in complete or nearly complete loss of gata <dig> and lethality.

the action of g5sp mo results in the formation of mutant gata <dig> protein with a deleted c-terminal zn finger, dgata <dig> . given that the c-terminus zn finger is sufficient for dna binding of gata <dig>  <cit> , we expected that the dgata <dig> protein would be inactive. this was confirmed by showing that dgata <dig> is unable to activate gata transcriptional reporter in animal cap explants . the dgata <dig> protein was efficiently expressed in animal caps, indicating that its lack of transcriptional activity is likely due to loss of dna-binding zn finger, rather then altered protein levels . dgata <dig> retains most of the wt coding sequence, including the activation domains and the n-terminal zn finger. in order to test if dgata <dig> retained any activity which enabled it to interact with factors such as the wild-type gata <dig> or gata <dig>  we modelled the potential interaction between the wtgata4/ <dig> and dgata <dig> proteins, as it may occur in vivo in g5sp morphants where the mo was 50% effective in generating the dgata <dig> protein. an equal amount of mrnas encoding wtgata4/ <dig> and dgata <dig> proteins was co-injected into embryos together with a gata transcriptional reporter. we found that dgata <dig> does not substantially alter transcriptional activity of either gata <dig> or gata <dig> in animal caps . these results suggest that the phenotype caused by the low doses of g5sp mo  likely results from a reduction in the amount of the wt protein.

an additional non-overlapping translation-blocking mo, g5utr also caused deficiency in heart and liver tissue . however, g5utr mo was less effective , requiring a  <dig> times greater dose then g <dig> mo to produce a similar phenotype. the difference in efficiency between these mos might reflect the different location of their target sequences along the gata <dig> mrna: the g <dig> mo target is immediately downstream of the start codon, whereas the g5utr mo interacts with its target  <dig> nt upstream , and its' efficiency might be affected by the 5'utr secondary structure.

gata <dig> is required for heart and liver development in xenopus embryos
gata <dig> was shown in both zebrafish  <cit>  and mouse  <cit>  to be essential for heart and liver development following specification, but its role in xenopus has not been investigated in detail. to address this question we designed a mo targeted against both x. laevis alleles and x tropicalis gata <dig> . this mo, g <dig>  causes specific blocking of translation of injected mrna  and results in heart and liver defects . the majority of g <dig> morphants had heart morphogenesis defects but had detectable heart and liver gene expression . however, in these experiments the status of endogenous gata <dig> in g <dig> morphants was unknown. therefore, we additionally tested the role of gata <dig> by using a splice-blocking mo, g4sp, which was designed like the g5sp mo to cause in-frame removal of exon  <dig> in its target. as shown in fig. 4d, g4sp mo caused a dose-dependent splicing out of exon  <dig> in both x. tropicalis and x. laevis, resulting in heart and liver defects. g4sp morphants closely resembled g <dig> morphants . however, the maximum activity of the g4sp mo  was reached at  <dig> ng/embryo , unlike g5sp mo, which was effective in causing complete splicing above  <dig> ng/embryo. further increase in the dose of the g4sp mo to  <dig> and  <dig> ng/embryo did not improve the efficiency of splicing . this result was observed in both x. laevis and x. tropicalis  and therefore likely represents inherent property of the g4sp mo, rather then inefficient action caused by sequence divergence. g4sp mo did not cause splicing out of exon  <dig> in gata <dig> mrna .

importantly, the phenotype caused by the doses of g4sp mo above  <dig> ng closely resembled the phenotype of g <dig> morphants , suggesting that loss of greater than 50% of wt gata <dig> leads to heart and liver defects. the effect of g4sp mo was dose dependent, with the proportion of embryos with cardiac and liver defects increasing from 33% at  <dig> ng/embryo to 95% at  <dig> ng/embryo . the gata <dig> mos were far less effective in causing severe phenotype  than the mos against gata <dig> . the great majority  of gata <dig> morphants displayed defects in expansion or morphogenesis of the heart primordium, including cardia bifida, partial fusion of heart fields and abnormal looping. these results suggest that gata <dig> is required for heart development after cardiac specification.

gata <dig> is required before gata <dig> for development of heart and liver precursors
to determine when gata <dig> and gata <dig> are required for heart development, we have examined the expression of nkx <dig> , a marker of heart field in late neurula stages, when it is robustly expressed  <cit> . another reason for performing the analysis at st.  <dig> was that previous fate mapping studies have shown that at st.  <dig> nkx <dig> -expressing cells contribute to the developing heart  <cit> . we found that injection of any gata <dig> mo, but not gata <dig> or gata <dig> mos  <cit> , cause a substantial reduction in expression of nkx <dig>  .

the expression of another marker which is expressed in a subset of cardiac precursors at the same time, tbx <dig>  <cit> , was also reduced by gata <dig> mo , providing further evidence that gata <dig> is required for specification of cardiac precursors. we have additionally tested the effect of gata <dig> mos on nkx <dig>  expression at st.  <dig>  near its' onset,  <cit>  and just after cardiac specification  <cit> . our rt-pcr analyses indicate that gata <dig> mos do not block expression of nkx <dig>  at st.  <dig> . however, as early-expressing nkx <dig> -positive cells have not been fate mapped, and, more importantly, since there are no known cardiac-specific markers that uniquely identify cardiac precursors at the time of their specification, the earliest requirement for gata <dig> in heart development remains unknown at present.

to examine the effect of gata <dig> and gata <dig> mos on early liver precursors, we first established that hex-expressing cells in the anterior ventral endoderm of st.  <dig> embryos are fated to become the liver primordium . we next established that injection of g <dig> mo , but not of control mo or gsp <dig> mo , leads to an almost complete loss of hex expression. this result suggests that gata <dig> is required for liver specification. however, additional specific markers are required to establish the requirement of early liver precursors for gata <dig> 

the same dose of g <dig> mo that causes a reduction of hex expression at st.  <dig> and later cause heart and liver defects in tadpoles had no effect on hex expression in gastrulae . however, higher doses of g <dig> and g5sp mos  lead to a reduction of hex expression at st  <dig> . these results indicate that gata <dig> regulates hex in time- and dose-dependent manner.

we have additionally established that gata <dig> is likely to be a direct regulator of hex expression, as it is sufficient to induce hex mrna in an immediate-early fashion in gastrula-stage animal caps . at this stage hex expression marks anterior endoderm  <cit> . whether hex is also an immediate-early target of gata <dig> in liver precursors at st.  <dig> is not known.

gata <dig> is expressed in endoderm during gastrulation and subsequently during neurula and early tailbud stages in mesoderm and anterior endoderm  <cit> . in our experiments g5sp mo has been shown to be effective until tadpole stages , having the potential to affect both early and late phases of gata <dig> expression, which could both be involved in normal development of heart and liver. therefore, at present it is not clear when precisely gata <dig> acts in the development of heart and liver precursors.

endodermal gata <dig> and gata <dig> are required for normal heart development
gata <dig> and gata <dig> are expressed in both cardiac mesoderm and hepatogenic endoderm, and are required for their normal development. in our experiments we have downregulated gata <dig> and gata <dig> in both heart and liver precursors, and therefore the cell autonomy of their function was not addressed. to begin to address the specific roles of gata <dig> and gata <dig> in heart and liver precursors in more detail, we have performed mosaic analysis by targeting gata <dig> or gata <dig> mos at 32/ <dig> cell-stage to anterior-vegetal blastomeres, fated to contribute to anterior endoderm  <cit> . mos were co-injected with rhodamine-dextran, and the fate of injected cells was followed from tailbud stages. this allowed us to examine heart development in real time in embryos with correct  targeting. in those embryos heart development was examined by using cardiac actin gfp reporter transgenic line  <cit> . as shown in fig.  <dig>  the presence of both g4sp and g5sp mos in anterior endoderm causes abnormal cardiac morphogenesis  or poor expansion of the ventricle , suggesting that both factors can act in endoderm to affect the development of neighbouring heart primordium. in these experiments we have not observed more severe phenotypes that have been seen with uniform injection of the mos . however, given that it is difficult to specifically target all anterior endodermal precursors by injections, and since the efficacy of mosaically expressed mos is unknown, our knowledge of the roles of endodermal gata <dig> and gata <dig> is still incomplete.

gata <dig> and gata <dig> interact in heart and liver development in xenopus embryos
gata4/5/ <dig> are expressed in overlapping patterns in heart and endoderm in vertebrate embryos, and share many biochemical properties, including the domain structure and dna binding site preference  <cit> . we have addressed the possibility of redundancy between gata <dig> and gata <dig>  as their knockdowns cause a later and milder heart and liver precursor phenotype than a knockdown of gata <dig>  have no effect or cause only a mild phenotype, their co-injection causes heart and liver defects that resemble the phenotype caused by  <dig> ng of the gata <dig> mo or  <dig> ng of the gata <dig> mo . these results strongly suggest that gata <dig> and gata <dig> interact during development of heart and liver.

discussion
gata <dig> is essential for early heart and liver development in xenopus embryos
in this report we have established that in xenopus embryos gata <dig> is required for the early development of heart and liver. downregulation of gata <dig> in both xenopus laevis and xenopus tropicalis using two non-overlapping translation-blocking mos and by using a splice-site blocking mo causes a severe reduction in the number of heart and liver precursors at the time of or shortly after their specification. our results are in broad agreement with the analysis of the faust  zebrafish mutants, which show abnormal development of the heart and endodermal tissues, including the liver  <cit> . however, the genetic analyses of gata <dig> in zebrafish have been limited by the fact that of two described faust alleles the stronger one remains uncharacterised at the molecular level, by considerable variability of the phenotype and by a possibility of maternal contribution  <cit> .

a recent report has examined the roles of gata4/5/ <dig> in heart development of xenopus laevis and zebrafish embryos  <cit> . in contrast to our findings, peterkin et al. have concluded that in xenopus embryos gata <dig> only plays a relatively minor role in heart development, after specification. this discrepancy likely reflects different approaches taken to address the role of gata5: whilst peterkin et al. have used a single mo  that we have used in  <dig> out of  <dig> nucleotides), we have used two non-overlapping translation blocking mos in addition to a splice site-blocking mo to induce similar phenotypes in two species, x. laevis and x. tropicalis. in addition, we have also documented the efficiency of splice-site blocking mo by gene expression analyses. the data of peterkin et al. on the role of gata <dig> in zebrafish based on the use of both translation-blocking and splice-site blocking mos have confirmed and extended the results obtained in faust mutants, that gata <dig> is the most important and earliest-acting gata factor in heart development and are in better agreement with our study. one difference, however, is that we found that high doses of g <dig> and g5sp mos cause gastrulation defects and early lethality in xenopus, whereas in the zebrafish gata <dig> morphants have a milder phenotype  <cit> . at present it is not clear if this reflects a greater reliance of the frog embryo on gata <dig> for early development, as it is also possible that the apparent difference reflects maternal contribution to gata <dig> function in zebrafish. clearly, a direct comparison and more complete answer about the role of gata <dig> in xenopus and zebrafish will require the generation and characterisation of embryos without gata <dig> activity in both models.

our results appear to disagree with the reported lack of embryonic phenotype of the gata <dig> gene-targeted mice  <cit> . however, it has been suggested that in the mouse the targeting strategy might not have resulted in a null mutation  <cit> , and it therefore remains to be established whether gata <dig> plays a conserved role in early development of mammals.

the findings of our study strongly suggest that gata <dig> is required very early in the development of cardiac and liver precursors, and are consistent with the reported ability of gata <dig> to induce cardiac and endodermal tissue in xenopus and zebrafish embryos  <cit> . having found that gata <dig> is essential for heart and liver development in xenopus embryos, it will now be important to understand how it acts. our initial experiments designed to address the cellular basis of gata <dig> action in heart and liver development have suggested that gata <dig> mos do not significantly alter the pattern of apoptosis or proliferation in heart and liver precursors at the time when their numbers are greatly reduced . whilst it is possible that gata <dig> mos affect cell proliferation and apoptosis in heart- and liver-forming area of the embryo at an earlier stage, ultimately better knowledge of the mechanism of action of gata <dig> will require identification of the target genes that mediate its' action. in this report we have begun this process by showing that homeobox gene hex is an immediate-early target of gata <dig>  and we are currently extending this finding by conducting a systematic search for targets of gata <dig> 

dose-dependent roles of gata <dig> in early development
in this report we have focused on the role of gata <dig> in heart and liver development, however during the course of our work we have observed that gata <dig> also plays an essential earlier role, during gastrulation. this early role was revealed using higher doses of g5sp mo which efficiently remove wt gata <dig> mrna  and result in severe gastrulation defects and death . however, one limitation of this result is that it remains to be formally established whether the action of the g5sp mo represents the equivalent of a null mutation, despite the fact that we found no evidence for activity of the mutant dgata <dig> protein . a very similar early phenotype that likely results from a complete or nearly complete loss of gata <dig> activity was obtained by higher doses of g <dig> mo , providing additional evidence that gata <dig> has an essential role during gastrulation.

the two roles of gata <dig> have a differential requirement for the level of gata <dig> protein, with the development of heart and liver precursors being more sensitive. a part of our effort to identify targets of gata <dig> is currently focused on isolation of subsets of targets that require different levels of gata <dig> activity. an interesting precedent for dose-dependent action of gata factors has recently been established for gata <dig>  which has been shown to directly regulate subsets of target genes that differentially respond to its levels  <cit> .

the role of gata <dig> in heart and liver development in xenopus embryos
our work shows that in xenopus laevis and xenopus tropicalis gata <dig> is required for development of heart and liver precursors after their specification. this has been established by using a specific translation-blocking mo and a splice-site blocking mo that operates in a similar manner to g5sp mo, resulting in the removal of exon  <dig>  however, unlike g5sp mo, which at doses that cause approximately 50% splicing of its target induces severe heart and liver defects, the maximal activity of the g4sp mo, 90% of splicing of its target, results in a milder phenotype, characterised by heart morphogenesis defects. as mentioned above, one limitation of the results obtained with splice-blocking gata4/ <dig> mos is that it is unclear whether they create an equivalent of a null mutation. nevertheless, our results show that xenopus embryos have a greater and earlier requirement for gata <dig> than for gata <dig>  a recent study by peterkin et al, utilising translation-blocking mos in xenopus laevis has reported that gata <dig> is required for cardiac morphogenesis, but not for cardiac gene expression  <cit> . whilst their conclusions on the role of gata <dig> in morphogenesis are in broad agreement with our study, our work suggests that gata <dig> mos also affect cardiac gene expression. it is possible that this apparent discrepancy reflects the unknown effect of translation-blocking mos on endogenous gata <dig> protein. as in the case of gata <dig> stated above, the precise role of gata <dig> in early development of xenopus and zebrafish will be better defined when embryos lacking gata <dig> become available.

the role of gata <dig> in heart and liver development in xenopus embryos revealed by our study appears to be in good agreement with the results from zebrafish and mouse embryos  <cit> . gata <dig> mos frequently result in embryos with cardia bifida , a defect that also characterises gata <dig> null mouse embryos  <cit> . in the mouse model, the cardia bifida phenotype is caused by gata4-defective extraembryonic endoderm  <cit> . it is of note that in our xenopus study specific downregulation of gata <dig> in anterior endoderm also affects heart morphogenesis . it is possible that these distinct forms of endoderm may share signalling activities despite being of different embryological origin.

an additional conserved feature of the action of gata <dig> in development of heart and liver in xenopus is its dose-dependent interaction with gata <dig>  which has been shown by genetic analyses of compound heterozygous mice and by mos in zebrafish  <cit> . it is intriguing to speculate that the mechanism of this genetic interaction involves direct interaction and synergism of gata <dig> and gata <dig> proteins, as suggested by in vitro studies  <cit> .

development of heart and liver and gata factors
in our study we have assessed the roles of gata <dig> and gata <dig> in early heart and liver development. remarkably, the vast majority of morphants for either gata factor displayed reduced or altered expression of both heart and liver markers. one implication of these results is that the development of heart and liver are closely linked. in amniotes it has been shown that cardiac mesoderm induces liver fate in adjacent foregut endoderm  <cit> , and conversely, endoderm is required for cardiac morphogenesis, as revealed by gata <dig> mutant mice  <cit> . finally, work from xenopus and chick models have established a role for anterior endoderm, which is fated to become liver, in cardiac specification  <cit> . the fates of heart and liver appear to be closely intertwined through reciprocal interactions and gata factors may mediate at least some of those. our mosaic analyses of gata <dig> and gata <dig> function suggests that they can act in anterior endoderm to affect heart morphogenesis non-cell autonomously. these results are in good agreement with the null phenotype of gata <dig> mice, which display heart defects caused by deficiency of gata <dig> in endoderm  <cit> . more recent studies of the function of gata <dig> in the myocardium of the mouse embryo have also demonstrated a later cell-autonomous role in growth of the heart  <cit> , and we anticipate a similar role for xenopus gata <dig>  however, given that the resolution of our experiments has been limited by the unknown efficacy of mos targeted to a small part of the embryo, and by difficulty in uniquely targeting cardiac precursors by injections, better understanding of cell-specific role of gata factors in xenopus will require genetic and transgenic approaches  <cit> .

splice-site blocking morpholino oligonucleotides as a tool for in vivo structure-function mapping
in this report we have shown that splice-site blocking mos can be used to study the role of c-terminal zn finger domain of gata <dig> and gata <dig> in development. this was possible because functional domains of gata <dig> and gata <dig> are encoded by distinct exons, and because for both genes exons  <dig> and  <dig> are in the same coding frame. our results suggest that the c-terminal zn finger dna binding domain is essential for the function of gata <dig> and gata <dig> in heart and liver development. however, as the c-terminal zn finger of gata <dig> also determines interactions with mads box and nkx <dig>  binding partners  <cit> , the relative contribution of dna- and protein-interactions to the function of this domain in embryos is not clear at present.

CONCLUSIONS
the main finding of this work is that in xenopus embryos gata <dig> plays an early, essential and dose-dependent role in the development of the heart and liver. downregulation of gata <dig> causes severe reduction in the number of heart and liver precursors at the time of or shortly after their specification. in addition, we have found that in xenopus gata <dig> is required for heart and liver development only later after their specification. these results have confirmed and significantly extended previous studies on the roles of gata <dig> and gata <dig> in early vertebrate development.
