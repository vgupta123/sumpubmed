BACKGROUND
lice in the suborder anoplura are wingless, exclusive blood-sucking insects and are permanent ectoparasites of eutherian mammals  <cit> . blood-sucking lice evolved from chewing lice ~ <dig> million years ago  and diversified rapidly ~ <dig> mya with their mammalian hosts  <cit> . more than  <dig> species of blood-sucking lice have been described and are classified into  <dig> families and  <dig> genera  <cit> . twelve of the  <dig> recognized mammalian orders and ~ <dig> mammalian species are hosts of blood-sucking lice. the diversity of blood-sucking lice mirrors that of their mammalian hosts with 67% of the described species found on rodents  <cit> . each species of mammalian host is usually parasitized by a single species of blood-sucking lice, but there are exceptions as many mammalian species are hosts of multiple species of blood-sucking lice   <cit> . vice versa, each species of blood-sucking lice usually parasitizes only one species of mammals, but many species of blood-sucking lice parasitize multiple species of mammals that are closely related phylogenetically   <cit> .

adding to their unique, exclusive blood-feeding life style and the high host-specificity , recent studies revealed that blood-sucking lice have an unusual, fragmented mitochondrial  genome organization. for insects and other bilateral animals, the mt genome is usually a single, circular chromosome, 13– <dig> kb long, with  <dig> genes:  <dig> for proteins, two for ribosomal rnas and  <dig> for transfer rnas  <cit> . the mt genomes of the human body louse, pediculus humanus, and the human head louse, pediculus capitis, however, have  <dig> minichromosomes; each minichromosome has 1– <dig> genes and is 3– <dig> kb in size  <cit> . the  <dig> mt genes identified in the human pubic louse, pthirus pubis, are on  <dig> minichromosomes; each minichromosome has 1– <dig> genes and is  <dig> – <dig>  kb in size  <cit> . the domestic pig louse, haematopinus suis, and the wild pig louse, haematopinus apri, have their  <dig> mt genes on nine minichromosomes; each minichromosome has 2– <dig> genes and is 3– <dig> kb in size  <cit> .

the fragmented mitochondrial genomes of the human lice and the pig lice represent the most radical departure to date in bilateral animals from the typical, single-chromosome organization of mt genomes, although multipartite mt genomes have also been observed in the rotifer, brachionus plicatilis, and the booklouse, liposcelis bostrychophila, which have two mt chromosomes  <cit> , and the potato cyst nematode, globodera pallida, which has six chromosomes  <cit> . outside bilateral animals, highly fragmented mt genomes were observed in ichthyosporean protists  <cit> , diplonemid protists  <cit>  and box jellyfish  <cit> .

although all having fragmented mt genomes, the human lice and the pig lice differ substantially in the extent of mt genome fragmentation and in the distribution of mt genes over the minichromosomes  <cit> . to understand whether, or not, any life-history factors are linked to such variation, we sequenced the mt genomes of two species of blood-sucking lice that parasitize rats, polyplax asiatica  and polyplax spinulosa . polyplax is one of the most species-rich genus of the suborder anoplura with  <dig> described species, second only to the genus hoplopleura, which has  <dig> described species  <cit> . polyplax species shared their most recent common ancestor  with primate lice ~ <dig> mya and their mrca with pig lice ~ <dig> mya  <cit> . po. asiatica infests the greater bandicoot rat, bandicota indica, three other related species of rats and occasionally the asian house shrew, suncus murinus <cit> . po. spinulosa infests the asian house rat, rattus tanezumi, the brown rat, rattus norvegicus, the black rat, rattus rattus, and six other related species of rats  <cit> . while po. asiatica is only found in asia, po. spinulosa has a worldwide distribution and is responsible, as a vector, for the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms such as mycoplasma haemomuris , rickettsia typhi, trypanosoma lewisi, borrellia duttoni and brucella brucei <cit> . we show that both po. asiatica and po. spinulosa have fragmented mt genomes; these two species, however, differ in the pattern of mt genome fragmentation. furthermore, our comparison among the rat lice, the human lice and the pig lice indicates a possible inverse link between the extent of mt genome fragmentation and the length of life cycle of these lice.

methods
collection of rats and lice
the blood-sucking lice, po. asiatica and po. spinulosa, were collected in  <dig> from the greater bandicoot rat, b. indica, and the asian house rat, r. tanezumi, respectively, in jinping county, yunnan province, china. the rats were caught with trap-cages set indoors  and outdoors . alive rats trapped were placed individually in pre-marked cotton bags and transferred to laboratory for species identification and parasitological check. blood-sucking lice on the body surface of each rodent host were collected and preserved in 95% ethanol at −20°c prior to dna extraction. samples of po. asiatica and po. spinulosa and their rat hosts were deposited in the institute of pathogens and vectors, dali university. the capture of rodents was approved by health authorities in yunnan province, china. animal protocols and procedures were approved by the animal ethics committees at guizhou university and dali university.

dna extraction, mitochondrial genome amplification and sequencing
genomic dna was extracted from individual louse specimens with dneasy tissue kit . for po. asiatica  collected from the greater bandicoot rats, a 532-bp fragment of cox <dig> and a 360-bp fragment of rrnl were initially amplified by pcr with primer pairs mtd6-mtd <dig> and16sf-lx16sr . these two pairs of primers target conserved sequence motifs in cox <dig> and rrnl; the amplicons were sequenced directly using sanger method at the tiangen biotech, beijing . two pairs of specific primers for po. asiatica, cox57f-cox57r and 16s57f-16s57r, were designed from sequences of the cox <dig> and rrnl fragments. the two specific primers in each pair go outbound with  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively, in between. pcrs with these specific primers amplified two near full-length mt minichromosomes of po. asiatica that contain cox <dig> and rrnl respectively; these amplicons  were sequenced using sanger method at the tbb. another pair of primers specific to po. asiatica, 57f-57r, was designed from conserved non-coding sequences that flank the coding regions of the two minichromosomes above. the pcr with 57f-57r primer pair produced a mixture of amplicons ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kb in size, expected from the coding regions of all mt minichromosomes of po. asiatica . these amplicons were sequenced with illumina hiseq  <dig> platform at the beijing genome institute, hong kong . the pcr strategy used in this study was developed from the observations we made in previous studies on the human lice and the pig lice that each mt minichromosome has a distinct coding region but a well-conserved non-coding region  <cit> .

for po. spinulosa  collected from the asian house rats, a 452-bp fragment of rrns and a 360-bp fragment of rrnl were amplified initially by pcr with primer pairs 12sa-12sb and 16sf-lx16sr . these two pairs of primers target conserved sequence motifs in rrns and rrnl and the pcr amplicons were sequenced directly using sanger method at the tbb. two pairs of specific primers for po. spinulosa, 12s301f-12s301r and 16s301f-16s301r, were designed from sequences of the rrns and rrnl fragments. the two specific primers in each pair go outbound and are  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp respectively from each other. pcrs with these two pairs of specific primers amplified two mt minichromosomes of po. spinulosa that contain rrns and rrnl respectively; these amplicons  were sequenced using sanger method at the tbb. another pair of primers specific to po. spinulosa, 301f-301r, was designed from conserved non-coding sequences that flank the coding regions of the two minichromosomes above. the pcr with primer pair 301f-301r produced a mixture of amplicons ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kb in size, expected from the coding regions of all mt minichromosomes of po. spinulosa . these amplicons were sequenced with illumina hiseq  <dig> platform at the bgi-hk.

taq dna polymerase  was used in the initial short pcrs with the following cycling conditions: 94°c for  <dig> min;  <dig> cycles of 98°c for  <dig> sec, 45°c for  <dig> sec, 72°c for  <dig> min; and a final extension of 72°c for  <dig> min. la taq  was used in the long pcrs with the cycling conditions: 94°c for  <dig> min,  <dig> cycles of 98°c for  <dig> sec, 60–65°c  for 30– <dig> sec, 68°c for  <dig> min; and 72°c for  <dig> min. positive and negative controls were executed with each pcr. pcr amplicons were checked by agarose gel  electrophoresis; the sizes of pcr amplicons were estimated by comparing with molecular markers. pcr products were purified with wizard sv gel and pcr clean-up system .

assembly of illumina sequence-reads, gene identification and verification of individual mitochondrial minichromosomes
illumina sequence-reads obtained from the mt minichromosomes of po. asiatica and po. spinulosa were assembled into contigs with geneious  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> ; the parameters for assembly were minimum overlap identity 98% and minimum overlap  <dig> bp. trna genes were identified using trnascan-se  <cit>  and arwen  <cit> . protein-coding genes and rrna genes were identified with blast searches of genbank  <cit> . identical sequences shared between genes were identified with wordmatch  <cit> . sequence alignments were with clustal x  <cit> . the size and circular organization of each mt minichromosome of po. asiatica and po. spinulosa identified by sequence-read assembly were verified by pcr . a pair of outbound primers  was designed from the coding region of each minichromosome . the two primers in each pair were next to each other with a small gap or no gap in between. pcrs with these primers amplify the full or near full length of each minichromosome if it has a circular organization. pcr set-up, cycling conditions, agarose gel electrophoresis and size measurement were the same as described above. the nucleotide sequences of the mt genomes of po. asiatica and po. spinulosa have been deposited in genbank under accession numbers kf647751–kf <dig> 

RESULTS
mitochondrial genome of polyplax asiatica, the louse of the greater bandicoot rats
we obtained  <dig>  sequence-reads from the mt genome of po. asiatica by illumina sequencing . the sequence-reads are  <dig> bp each; assembly of these sequence-reads into contigs allowed us to identify all of the  <dig> mt genes typical of animals in po. asiatica distributed over  <dig> minichromosomes . each minichromosome is circular,  <dig> – <dig>  kb in size , and consists of a coding region and a non-coding region. each coding region contains two to seven genes, and varies in size from  <dig> bp for rrns-trnc minichromosome to  <dig>  bp for trnh-nad <dig> minichromosome  . seven of the  <dig> minichromosomes of po. asiatica have one protein-coding or rrna gene each; the other four minichromosomes have two protein-coding genes each. the  <dig> trna genes are scattered over  <dig> of the  <dig> minichromosomes; each minichromosome has one to five trna genes except atp8-atp <dig>  which has no trna genes . each of the  <dig> mt genes identified in po. asiatica is present on only one minichromosome; there is no overlap in gene content between different minichromosomes. all of the  <dig> mt genes have the same orientation of transcription relative to the non-coding region, except trnt and nad <dig>  which have the opposite orientation of transcription relative to other genes .

mitochondrial genome of polyplax spinulosa, the louse of the asian house rats
we obtained  <dig>  sequence-reads from the mt genome of po. spinulosa by illumina sequencing . as above for po. asiatica, these sequence-reads are  <dig> bp each in length. we assembled these sequence-reads into contigs and identified all of the  <dig> mt genes typical of animals in po. spinulosa. these genes are on  <dig> minichromosomes; each minichromosome is  <dig> – <dig>  kb in size and has a circular organization . as in po. asiatica, seven of the  <dig> minichromosomes of po. spinulosa have one protein- or rrna-coding gene each; the other four minichromosomes have two protein-coding genes each. the  <dig> trna genes are on  <dig> of the  <dig> minichromosomes; each minichromosome has one to four trna genes except atp8-atp <dig>  which has no trna genes . each minichromosome has a coding region and a non-coding region. the coding region of each minichromosome contains two to six genes, and varies in size from  <dig> bp for atp8-atp <dig> minichromosome to  <dig>  bp for trnh-nad5-trnf minichromosome. with the only exception of nad <dig>  all of the mt genes of po. spinulosa have the same orientation of transcription relative to the non-coding regions .

discussion
variation in the pattern of mt genome fragmentation between the two polyplax rat lice
only two of the  <dig> minichromosomes have identical gene content and gene arrangement between po. asiatica and po. spinulosa, revealing, for the first time, marked intra-genus variation in the pattern of mt genome fragmentation among blood-sucking lice . comparison between the two polyplax rat lice, and with the pig lice and the human lice, revealed the translocations of trna genes between minichromosomes in both po. asiatica and po. spinulosa after these two species split from their mrca, and furthermore, the swap of identities between the two trna-leucine genes in po. spinulosa after the split.

rrns-trnc minichromosome is present in the rat louse, po. asiatica, and the two haematopinus species of the pig lice, indicating this minichromosome is ancestral to the rat lice, the pig lice and the human lice . in the rat louse, po. spinulosa, however, trns
1
-trns
2
 has been inserted upstream rrns gene . the gene arrangement, 
nad1
-
trnt
-trng-nad3-trnw , is present in po. asiatica and the haematopinus pig lice, indicating this arrangement to be ancestral to the rat lice, the pig lice and the human lice . in po. spinulosa, however, trnt has been inserted upstream trnd gene, leaving a 54-bp pseudo-trnt between nad <dig> and trng . the gene arrangement, cox3-trna, which is present in po. asiatica, the haematopinus pig lice and the human lice, is apparently ancestral to these lice. in po. spinulosa, however, trna has been inserted downstream nad <dig> gene .

translocation of trna genes between minichromosomes also occurred in po. asiatica. the gene arrangement, trnp-cox <dig>  which is present in po. spinulosa and the haematopinus pig lice, is apparently ancestral to the rat lice, the pig lice and the human lice . in po. asiatica, however, trnp has been inserted downstream trnn, leaving a 57-bp pseudo-trnp between nad4l and cox <dig> . unusually, there is a 189-bp noncoding region in between trnn and trnp . the gene arrangement, nad5-trnf, which is ancestral to insects  <cit> , is retained in po. spinulosa and the haematopinus pig lice. in po. asiatica, however, trnf has been inserted downstream nad <dig> gene .

the rat louse, po. asiatica, and the haematopinus pig lice retained an ancestral gene arrangement of insects, cox1-trnl
2
   <cit> . the gene arrangement, trnl
1
-rrnl, which is present in po. asiatica, the haematopinus pig lice, and the human head and body lice, is apparently ancestral to these lice. in po. spinulosa, however, these two trnl genes swapped their positions: trnl
1
 lies downstream cox <dig> in one minichromosome whereas trnl
2
 lies upstream rrnl in another minichromosome . given the high sequence similarity between trnl
1
 and trnl
2
 , it is more likely that these two trna genes swapped their identities by recombination or point mutations at the third anti-codon positions than by translocations of these two genes between minichromosomes, as observed previously in the human head louse and body louse  <cit> .

recombination between mt genes in parasitic lice
in the human lice and the pig lice, ten pairs of mt genes share stretches of identical sequences much longer than expected by chance, providing striking evidence for dna recombination between mt genes and between minichromosomes  <cit> . as in the human lice and the pig lice, trnl
1
 and trnl
2
 in both rat lice, po. asiatica and po. spinulosa, share 28-bp and 25-bp identical sequences respectively , which are 4– <dig> times longer than in the animals that have the typical mt genome organization . recombination between trnl
1
 and trnl
2
 appears to be common in the blood-sucking lice and occurs likely more frequent than other mt genes.

two other pairs of mt genes in the rat louse, po. spinulosa, also share identical sequences,  <dig> bp between cob and nad <dig>  and  <dig> bp between trna and trnc, which are 3– <dig> times longer than in other animals . recombination between cob and nad <dig>  and between trna and trnc in po. spinulosa, appears to be recent evolutionary events and less common as these two pairs of genes do not share longer-than-expected sequences in the other rat louse, po. asiatica, nor in the human lice and the pig lice . intriguingly, trna and trnc of the wallaby louse, heterodoxus macropus, share  <dig> bp identical sequence , which is 2– <dig> times longer than expected by chance, indicating that recombination between mt genes may also occur in the animals that have the typical mt genome organization although it is much rarer than in the blood-sucking lice, which have fragmented mt genomes.

it was suggested that recombination between trna genes could affect the secondary structure of their corresponding trnas  <cit> . this is, indeed, the case for trna-alanine and trna-cystine in the rat lice. the 32-bp identical sequence shared between trna and trnc in p. spinulosa falls on the aa-arm and t-arm of trna-alanine and trna-cystine. these two trnas have the longest t-arms among all of the trnas of po. spinulosa, with  <dig> pairs and  <dig> pairs respectively at the t-stems and  <dig> nt at the t-loop, in comparison to the average  <dig>  pairs and  <dig>  nt of the  <dig> trnas . in contrast, in the other rat louse, po. asiatica, in which trna and trnc do not share longer-than-expected sequences, the t-arms of trna-alanine and trna-cystine have  <dig> pairs and  <dig> pairs respectively at the t-stems, and  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt at the t-loop, which are very close to the average  <dig>  pairs and  <dig>  nt of the  <dig> trnas .

a possible link between the extent of mt genome fragmentation and the length of life cycle
the rat lice in the genus polyplax share their mrca with the human lice ~ <dig> mya, and share their mrca with the pig lice ~ <dig> mya   <cit> . the mt genomes of the two polyplax species we sequenced in the present study have  <dig>  genes on average on each minichromosome and thus, are less fragmented than those of the human lice  but are more fragmented than those of the pig lice . clearly, the extent of mitochondrial genome fragmentation varies among different lineages of the blood-sucking lice.

the pig lice, haematopinus suis and haematopinus apri, have the least fragmented mt genomes among the blood-sucking lice whose mt genomes have been sequenced completely or near completely sequenced to date  <cit> . intriguingly, these two haematopinus species have the largest body size  among the blood-sucking lice known  <cit> . the body size of the blood-sucking lice, however, does not appear to be linked to the extent of mt genome fragmentation as the human lice, pediculus humanus and pediculus capitis, have larger body size  than the polyplax rat lice  but have more fragmented mt genomes than the polyplax rat lice .

note: the information of body length and life cycle was from dynum et al.  <cit> , florence  <cit> , wall and shearer  <cit>  and baker et al.  <cit>  for the pig louse; from baker  <cit>  and goodwin et al.  <cit>  for the rat louse; from buxton  <cit>  and service  <cit>  for the human pubic louse; and from buxton  <cit> , buxton  <cit>  and service  <cit>  for the human body louse and head louse.

instead, the length of life cycle of the blood-sucking lice appears to be linked to the extent of mt genome fragmentation. the pig louse, h. suis, has the longest life cycle  and the least fragmented mt genome among the blood-sucking lice whose mt genomes have been sequenced completely or near completely to date . in contrast, the human head louse, pe. capitis, and the body louse, pe. humanus, have the shortest life cycle  and the most fragmented mt genomes. the rat louse, po. spinulosa, has both the length of life cycle  and the extent of mt genome fragmentation in between the pig lice and the human head and body lice. furthermore, the human pubic louse, pt. pubis, has both the length of life cycle  and the extent of mt genome fragmentation in between the rat lice and the human head and body lice. the inverse link between the length of life cycle and the extent of mt genome fragmentation, indicated in the present study by limited number of species, can be tested further with data from more species of blood-sucking lice, and other eukaryotes that have fragmented mt genomes such as the ichthyosporean protists  <cit> , diplonemid protists  <cit>  and box jellyfish  <cit> . currently, there is no sufficient data and information, to our knowledge, to link the length of life cycle  with the extent of mt genome fragmentation in these eukaryotes. theoretically, if mitochondrial genome fragmentation was a continuous process and each generation contributed approximately equally towards fragmentation, then it would be expected that the extent of fragmentation be inversely linked to the length of life cycle.

CONCLUSIONS
we sequenced the mt genomes of po. asiatica and po. spinulosa, collected from the greater bandicoot rat, b. indica, and the asian house rat, r. tanezumi. we identified all of the  <dig> mt genes common to animals in these rat lice. the mt genes of po. asiatica and po. spinulosa are on  <dig> minichromosomes; each minichromosome is 2– <dig> kb long and has 2– <dig> genes. the two rat lice share the same pattern for the distribution of the protein-coding genes and rrna genes over the minichromosomes, but differ in the pattern for the distribution of  <dig> of the  <dig> trna genes. the mt genomes of the two polyplax rat lice have  <dig>  genes, on average, on each minichromosome and thus, are less fragmented than those of the human lice  but are more fragmented than those of the pig lice . our results revealed distinct patterns of mt genome fragmentation between the two polyplax species of rat lice. we also showed that the extent of mt genome fragmentation appears to have an inverse link with the length of life cycle of the rat lice, the human lice and the pig lice. whether, or not, the extent of mt genome fragmentation is indeed linked to the length of life cycle, however, needs to be tested further with data from more species and broader phylogenetic ranges of blood-sucking lice, and other eukaryotes that have fragmented mt genomes.
