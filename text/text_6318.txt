BACKGROUND
in addition to the well known group of high stage neuroblastomas with mycn amplification and 1p-deletion, a second genetic subgroup of aggressive neuroblastomas has been delineated. this subgroup is characterised by the presence of 11q-deletions, often in association with 3p-deletions  <cit> . both subgroups typically present with 17q-gain or a normal chromosome  <dig> copy number, which are the strongest independent genetic indicators of poor prognosis  <cit> . deletions of 11q mostly affect a large distal part of the long arm. only a few small deletions have been identified which delineated a tentative sro  at 11q <dig> between markers d11s <dig> and d11s <dig>  encompassing a region of approximately  <dig> mb  <cit> . more recently however, a neuroblastoma patient was reported with a constitutional 11q <dig> -11q <dig>  deletion that did not overlap with the proposed sro  <cit> . consequently, the presumed localisation of the 11q neuroblastoma tumour suppressor gene  remains ill defined, thus hampering the selection of positional candidate genes. for the 11q <dig> region we proposed sdhd as a putative candidate neuroblastoma tumour suppressor, but only two bona fide mutations could be identified <cit> .

in addition to the observed losses of 11q in neuroblastoma, the existence of a tumour suppressor gene on 11q has also been supported by functional evidence obtained by microcell mediated chromosome  <dig> transfer  experiments  <cit> . although these studies were initially aimed at investigating the role of chromosome 1p in tumour suppression, the control chromosome  <dig> transfer experiment unexpectedly produced clones with morphological features of differentiation. introduction of chromosome  <dig> induced a more flattened and adherent morphology, with short neuritic processes, similar to the changes seen after a few days of growth in the presence of retinoic acid. as these microcell hybrids could be powerful models for the identification of candidate neuroblastoma suppressor or differentiation genes, we decided first to determine the genetic status of the chromosome  <dig> in the hybrid subclones prior to further experiments. to this purpose, the parental ngp cell line and the microcell hybrids after chromosome  <dig> transfer were analysed using high-resolution arraycgh , fish  and microsatellite heterozygosity mapping. following the identification of a region on chromosome  <dig> with altered copy number, we measured the mrna expression levels of genes in these regions in an attempt to find altered gene expression related to neurite outgrowth and differentiation.

RESULTS
morphological characterisation
the chromosome  <dig> status of the different microcell hybrid subclones used in this study and the reported chromosome  <dig> changes  <cit>  are listed in table  <dig>  the morphology of the cells was comparable to the phenotype described by bader and colleagues  <cit> . cells of the parental cell line ngp.1a.tr <dig>  were non-adherent, spheroid and growing in cell clusters . subclones with an apparently intact transferred chromosome  <dig> , as well as the clone with reported loss of a region on 11q  exhibited features of induced differentiation, with more flattened and adherent cells and some short neuritic processes . subclone mch574c <dig> with reported loss of part of 11p showed the same non-adherent phenotype as the parental cell line ngp.1a.tr <dig> .

del
assessment of the organisation of the actin fibres using phalloidin staining confirmed the presence of neurites  in subclones mch574c <dig> and mch574c <dig> <cit> .

arraycgh based chromosome  <dig> copy number assessment
arraycgh was performed for ngp.1a.tr <dig>  mch574c <dig> and mch574c <dig> cells. these hybridisations failed to provide evidence for the reported 11q-deletion in the transferred chromosome of microcell hybrid mch574c <dig> . unexpectedly, the distal region of the short arm of one of the chromosomes  <dig>  was deleted in both mch574c <dig> and mch574c <dig>  microcell hybrid mch574c <dig> presented with an additional larger deletion of 11pter->11p <dig>  as well as a third deletion involving the most distal band  in one of the chromosomes  <dig>  deletion of a single bac clone rp11-51b <dig> on 11p <dig>  was detected in the parental ngp.1a.tr <dig> cells . thus far, this clone has not been recognised as being involved in polymorphic genomic deletions for this particular chromosomal region . deletions observed by arraycgh were confirmed by fish analysis using one bac clone selected in each observed deleted region . this fish analysis demonstrated that the 11pter->11p <dig>  deletion was present in all other subclones that were not analysed with arraycgh, i.e. mch574c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> 

microsatellite heterozygosity mapping
to determine which of the chromosomes  <dig> exhibited loss of the 11pter->11p <dig> , 11pter->11p <dig> and 11q25->11qter regions, microsatellite heterozygosity mapping in conjunction with fish analysis of metaphase spreads was performed. microsatellite markers d11s <dig>  and d11s <dig>  were tested on ngp.1a.tr <dig>  mch574c <dig> and mch574c <dig>  these tests show that one of the two parental chromosomes  <dig> had lost the 11pter->11p <dig>  region, while the 11pter->11p <dig> segment was lost in the transferred chromosome. fish on metaphase spreads  demonstrated that the 11q25->11qter deletion occurred in the transferred chromosome  <dig>  whereas the 11pter->11p <dig>  deletion occurred in the normal parental chromosome  <dig> t) .

breakpoint delineation of chromosome  <dig> deletions
the position of the deletion breakpoints was confirmed or refined by fish analysis. the breakpoint of the del resulting from an unbalanced translocation between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in parental cell line ngp.1a.tr <dig> mapped within a  <dig>  mb segment located between bac clones rp11-379j <dig> and rp11-49m <dig> ). the breakpoint of the 11pter->11p <dig>  deletion of the normal parental chromosome  <dig> in all microcell hybrids was assigned to a  <dig> kb segment between rp11-452g <dig> and rp11-358h <dig> . the breakpoint of the larger 11p-deletion  present in mch574c <dig> was located within a  <dig> kb segment flanked by clones rp11-48o <dig> and rp11-202m <dig> . the breakpoint of the distal Â±  <dig> mb 11q25->11qter deletion of the transferred chromosome in subclone mch574c <dig> was mapped between bac clones rp11-340l <dig> and rp11-697e <dig> . flanking clones of the 11p <dig>  deletion in ngp.1a.tr <dig> were also tested using fish  demonstrating that the deletion involves at least a  <dig> kb segment including bac clones rp11-573e <dig> and rp11-47j <dig>  .

mrna expression profiling
as loss of 11q is a recurrent chromosomal aberration in a subgroup of advanced stage neuroblastomas, the 11q25->11qter region that is deleted in the mch574c <dig> microcell hybrid is of particular interest. in an attempt to relate the observed morphology of induced neuronal differentiation to expression differences of genes located in this distal 11q <dig> segment, the expression of  <dig> known genes, i.e. hnt, opcml, jam <dig>  thy <dig>  acad <dig> and b3gat <dig> was tested. of particular interest are hnt and b3gat <dig>  because of their reported involvement in neurite outgrowth and neural crest development. we quantified the mrna expression of these  <dig> genes in the microcell hybrids, the parental cell line and in neuroblastoma cell lines  that were treated with inducers of differentiation  <cit> . while the expression of the genes is not significantly altered in the microcell hybrids compared to the parental cell line, the expression of hnt is significantly higher in different cell lines that are induced to differentiate  .

discussion
in a search for candidate neuroblastoma genes located on chromosome arm 11q, we investigated microcell hybrids obtained by transfer of a normal chromosome  <dig> into ngp neuroblastoma cells with loss of 11q. although initially designed as a control experiment, this transfer resulted in morphological changes in the obtained hybrids  and also yielded revertants after further culture  <cit> . the induced differentiation that was observed in all but one microcell hybrid is consistent with the presence of a neuroblastoma differentiation gene on chromosome  <dig>  we thus anticipated that these hybrids might be of interest for functional mapping of the regions on chromosome  <dig> critically involved in neuroblastoma pathogenesis. to investigate this, we performed arraycgh copy number analysis of these microcell hybrids. this allowed us to assess the status of the introduced  chromosomes  <dig> and to validate these hybrids as model system for further functional assays. the obtained results were surprising and puzzling. one particular microcell hybrid that did not show the expected differentiation features upon chromosome  <dig> transfer was shown to carry an 11q25->11qter deletion in the transferred chromosome. in addition we found that all microcell hybrid subclones presented with an 11pter->11p <dig>  deletion, and that the mch574c <dig> hybrids presented with an additional 11pter->11p <dig> deletion.

in line with previous successful functional analyses of microcell hybrids  <cit> , the responsible gene for the observed changes in cell morphology is assumed to be located in one of the chromosomal regions that show a different copy number in the microcell hybrid subclones with differentiation features  compared to the non-adherent, spheroid cell phenotype of parental cell line ngp.1a.tr <dig> and microcell hybrid subclone mch574c <dig>  based upon our findings three regions can be identified as candidate regions harbouring a putative differentiation gene:  the 11q25->11qter region ,  the 11p13->11p <dig>  region  and  a small region of at least  <dig> kb on 11p <dig>   .

as loss of distal 11q is a recurrent chromosomal aberration in mycn single copy advanced stage neuroblastomas  <cit> , we propose the 11q25->11qter chromosomal segment as the most likely candidate region for the presence of a differentiation gene. despite efforts to define a shortest region of overlap  for 11q-loss in neuroblastoma by microsatellite heterozygosity mapping  <cit>  and delineation of constitutional 11q-deletions  <cit> , a consensus region for loss of 11q in neuroblastoma has not been defined thus far. in the light of the uncertainty of the boundaries of the 11q sro, the 11q25->11qter region must be considered as potentially harbouring a neuroblastoma suppressor or differentiation gene. this region is present in two copies in microcell hybrid subclones mch574c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> with differentiated morphology, but only in one copy in the non-adherent, spheroid cells from ngp.1a.tr <dig> and mch574c <dig>  six known genes, i.e. hnt, opcml, jam <dig>  thy <dig>  acad <dig> and b3gat <dig> are located in this distal 11q segment, of which two genes are of particular interest. hnt  is reported to promote neurite outgrowth and adhesion  <cit> . b3gat <dig> encodes for a protein that functions as the key enzyme in a glucuronyl transfer reaction during the biosynthesis of the carbohydrate epitope hnk <dig>   <cit> , which is a carbohydrate expressed in developmentally immature neural crest cells  <cit> . interestingly, the expression of hnt is significantly increased in neuroblastoma cell lines that are induced to differentiate using ra , ra plus bdnf , ngf  and tpa . however, hnt expression is not significantly different between the differentiated microcell hybrids and the parental cells. it is conceivable that the observed phenotypic changes are caused by small changes in expression that can not be reliably detected by q-pcr. an alternative explanation is that the normal parental chromosome  <dig> harbours a mutated allele that is normally expressed at the mrna level . reintroduction of a wild type allele by chromosome transfer could repair the defect, leading to differentiation. this is in keeping with reversal to the non-adherent, spheroid morphology of the microcell hybrids that have lost the 11q25->11qter region of the transferred chromosome. additional mutation, promoter hypermethylation and gene directed functional assays are needed to clarify which of the genes located within the deleted 11q25->11qter region are responsible for the differentiated phenotype.

while the 11q <dig> region is the best candidate region to harbour a differentiation gene, the observed deletions on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> may also account for the differentiated morphology. the observation of two independent deletion events along the distal part of chromosome arm 11p is suggestive for the involvement of this region. in particular, it is striking that all microcell hybrids in which chromosome  <dig> is transferred are characterised by the presence of an 11pter->11p <dig>  deletion in the  normal parental chromosome  <dig>  this may either be the result of an early coincidental event during the transfer process, or indicative for a selection process against the presence of three copies of a growth suppressive gene in this region. the last hypothesis may be further supported by the presence of unbalanced 11p-deletions in 4% of neuroblastomas   <cit> .

apart from highlighting at candidate 11q regions involved in neuroblastoma pathogenesis, this study clearly shows that it is important to monitor the transfer of the desired chromosome, as well as the genetic background of the cell line before and after chromosome transfer experiments. selective pressure processes may occur during or after transfer of a chromosome, e.g. by chromosomal loss in order to maintain the viability of the microcell hybrids. hence, detailed information on the chromosome copy number status before and after transfer is required in order to correlate phenotypic changes with chromosomal alteration. arraycgh has been proven to be a valuable screening method for evaluation of the chromosome alterations and for delineation of possible deletion events, allowing fine-mapping of the candidate regions that harbour candidate suppressor genes.

CONCLUSIONS
microsatellite marker heterozygosity analysis, fish and cgh based copy number in neuroblastoma tumour specimens and patients with constitutional deletions have thus far not identified a consensus sro for 11q-deletion. here, we present an alternative strategy to pinpoint chromosomal regions or genes that may be important in neuroblastoma pathogenesis. chromosome  <dig> transfer, followed by phenotype scoring and high-resolution copy number analysis delineated putative regions on chromosome  <dig> involved in tumour differentiation. further mutation and functional analyses are required to clarify the putative involvement of genes localised in these regions in neuroblastoma.
