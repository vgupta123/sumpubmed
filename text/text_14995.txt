BACKGROUND
the fall armyworm spodoptera frugiperda  occurs mainly in tropical and subtropical regions  <cit> , causing large losses to cotton and corn crops in the americas  <cit> . recent changes in the cropping system in the brazilian savanah  by the integration of crops such as cotton, corn, soybean and millet have led to an increase in the population densities of s. frugiperda  <cit> . control of s. frugiperda has been based on the use of genetically modified plants that express bt  toxins and on the use of synthetic insecticides. however, the strong selective pressure caused by these control methods has led to an increase of s. frugiperda resistance to bt toxins and to insecticides from different chemical groups  <cit> .

chitin biosynthesis inhibitors act by interfering with the synthesis or deposition of chitin on the exoskeleton and on other chitinized structures of insects  <cit> . given the specificity of their mode of action, this group of insecticides has been shown to have great potential in integrated pest management  programs because of its low toxicity to humans and higher animals  <cit> . the high pressure resulting from the widespread adoption of chitin biosynthesis inhibitors such as lufenuron for the control of insect pests in the brazilian cerrado has modified the susceptibility of s. frugiperda populations  <cit> . the observed reduction in the susceptibility of natural populations of s. frugiperda to chitin-synthesis inhibitors may indicate the evolution of resistance to this insecticide. thus, measures that enable the preservation of the useful life of this molecule are necessary.

currently, the main resistance mechanisms of s. frugiperda to insecticides involve mutations that lead to the insensitivity of target sites and/or alterations in the activity of enzymes involved with the detoxification or sequestration of xenobiotics . despite these findings, little is known about the gene expression profile of strains resistant to chitin biosynthesis inhibitors, and there are no studies for resistant strains of s. frugiperda to such products.

next-generation sequencers , such as solexa/illumina™ ,  <dig>  and solid™  platforms, generate a large amount of data  <cit>  that allows for an in depth investigation of transcriptomes at a low cost and in a short period of time.

we characterized the larval transcriptome of s. frugiperda and compared the larval gene expression patterns between luf-r and luf-s strains as a step towards understanding the molecular mechanism involved in s. frugiperda resistance to lufenuron in order to support the further development of rational, sustainable tools for pest and resistance management strategies.

RESULTS
de novo assembly of a reference transcriptome
sequencing of cdna libraries in the illumina hiscan 1000® platform generated  <dig> , <dig> reads of approximately 100 bp, corresponding to  <dig> , <dig>  nucleotides. after selection of reads through quality filters,  <dig>  % of the reads obtained were discarded due to their low quality scores .

changes in the k-mer parameter led to changes in almost all observed variables . thus, assemblies with a k-mer of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> were selected for performing the reference de novo assembly. assemblies used  <dig> , <dig> nucleotides, equivalent to  <dig>  % of the bases submitted for analysis. these individual assemblies were merged in a single de novo reference assembly, which resulted in the generation of  <dig>  transcripts with sizes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp , with a mean length of  <dig>  bp , a n <dig> of 996 bp and a n <dig> of 411 bp.

functional annotation
from the  <dig>  transcripts obtained, only  <dig>  %  were functionally annotated after a heuristic search against the ncbi non-redundant protein database . the similarity analysis yielded e-values from 10− <dig> to 10− <dig> for nearly 30 % of the mapped transcripts, while 24 % transcripts had even lower e-values, ranging from 10− <dig> to 10− <dig>  the highest e-value significance scores were identified in 6 % of the transcripts, and ranged from 10− <dig> to 10− <dig> . almost all of the alignments obtained were related to insects , and their majority  aligned against the silk moth bombyx mori , followed by the monarch butterfly danaus plexippus  . the representatives of the genus spodoptera  observed in the analysis were s. littoralis, s. exigua, s. litura and s. frugiperda, corresponding to 10 % of the obtained alignments; s. frugiperda accounted for 3 % of them. nearly two-thirds  of the  <dig>  annotated transcripts and gene ontologies were distributed in  <dig> functional groups in the category of proteins that function as cellular components,  <dig> groups in molecular functions and  <dig> groups in biological functions .

differential gene expression between luf-s and luf-r s. frugiperda larvae
a comparative gene expression analysis demonstrated luf-r and luf-s s. frugiperda larvae have distinct gene expression profiles . among the  <dig>  transcripts evaluated,  <dig> were differentially expressed  . these transcripts are from a large variety of functional categories, with a great number of transcripts associated with catalytic, binding and metabolic processes . among the differentially expressed transcripts,  <dig> transcripts were overexpressed in the larvae of the luf-r strain, with fold change values greater than  <dig> times the expression of the larvae of the luf-s strain. the fold change of the top  <dig> highly expressed transcripts in the luf-r larvae ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> fold the expression in the luf-s larvae. conversely, eight transcripts were suppressed in the luf-r strain, varying from − <dig> to − <dig>  fold the expression in the luf-s strain .fig.  <dig> distribution of differentially expressed transcripts from an rna-seq analysis of susceptible  and lufenuron-resistant  strains of s. frugiperda, induced or non-induced by lufenuron

the grouping analysis showed that the majority of the transcripts  were overexpressed, whereas  <dig>  % were suppressed in the resistant strain when compared to the susceptible strain . our analysis did not indicate substantial differences in the pattern of expression within each strain  following their exposure to lufenuron, showing that the majority of the overexpressed and suppressed transcripts of the luf-r strain exhibit constitutive expression.fig.  <dig> comparative distribution of functionally annotated transcripts of lufenuron-susceptible  and lufenuron-resistant  s. frugiperda strains that showed changes in the expression level. rpkm values were represented as a scale of colors ranging from green to red, which will encompass values from the lowest  to the highest  rpkm values



among the differentially expressed genes, two groups of candidate transcripts were selected because of their association with the cuticle metabolism and detoxification processes, as they could be related to the resistance mechanism of s. frugiperda to lufenuron . two out of the six selected transcripts involved in cuticle metabolism  were suppressed, while the remaining was overexpressed in the luf-r as compared to luf-s larvae .fig.  <dig> comparative distribution of transcripts associated with cuticle metabolism of lufenuron-susceptible  and lufenuron-resistant  s. frugiperda strains that showed changes in the expression level. rpkm values were represented as a scale of colors ranging from green to red, which will encompass values from the lowest  to the highest  rpkm values

out of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes involved in detoxification processes,  <dig> of them were annotated as p <dig>  monooxygenase, four as glutathione-s-transferase , six as carboxylase  and one as sulfotransferase . cyp was represented by several family members, especially cyp9a, cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> and cyp <dig>  transcript levels of  <dig> of these genes were much higher in luf-r larvae, while nine of them had their expression drastically reduced .

qpcr analysis
the differential expression patterns between luf-s and luf-r larvae were validated by the relative expression obtained by qpcr using a selected group of transcripts . all of the transcripts had higher gene expression in the luf-r as compared to the luf-s larvae, especially the transcripts cyp9a <dig> - l_464_t_3/ <dig> and cyp321a1- l_669_t_9/ <dig>  which exhibited fold changes of  <dig> and  <dig> times, respectively.fig.  <dig> qpcr analysis of selected cyp transcripts identified as differentially expressed in a broad rna-seq analysis of the larval transcriptome of susceptible  and resistant  strains of s. frugiperda to lufenuron, exposed  or not  to lufenuron treatment. expression of the selected genes is provided as fold change  using their expression at the luf-s, non-induced larvae as a reference



discussion
insect resistance is an evolutionary phenomenon arising from the continuous exposure of a population to the selective pressure represented by the indiscriminate use of insecticides  <cit> . currently, the main mechanisms associated with resistance development are mutations in the target sites of insecticides, the intermediation of the metabolism of insecticides by detoxification enzymes and tegumental changes that limit insecticide penetration  <cit> .

next-generation sequencing  technologies have brought great advances for genomic studies in non-model organisms. these technologies provide a large amount of data at a low cost  <cit> , increasing the possibility of recovering important biological information from transcriptomes  <cit> . therefore, this information is of great importance, given that events such as insect resistance to insecticides are biologically complex phenomena related to adaptive processes, such as mutations and metabolic processes, that are vital for organism maintenance  <cit> .

the de novo assembly of the transcriptome we performed allowed the evaluation of the differential expression between luf-r and luf-s larvae of s. frugiperda. a large number of differentially expressed transcripts were observed in between luf-r and luf-s larvae. to date, however, most of these transcripts have not been associated with the molecular mechanisms involved with insect resistance to insecticides. these results are similar to those reported for chlorantraniliprole-susceptible and resistant strains of plutella xylostella   <cit> . in this case,  <dig>  differentially expressed transcripts were identified, many of which were associated with metabolic pathways different from those clearly involved with the detoxification processes or of target sites of the insecticide. as an example, we observed severe down regulation of a eukaryotic translation initiation factor  in luf-r as compared to luf-s larvae, with a fold change of  <dig> . eukaryotic translation initiation factors have conserved functions related to translation events, mrna recruitment and regulation of the cellular machinery for protein synthesis  <cit> . therefore, significant changes in the expression of this transcript can be related to the strong regulation of post-transcriptional events in protein synthesis. conversely, the l_1097_t_4/ <dig> transcript, which is associated with the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex and linked to electron transport in the cellular respiration process  <cit> , was the up-regulated transcript with the highest fold change  observed in the luf-r strain. regulation of genes that affect the post-transcriptional gene expression and post-translational protein modification, as the translational initiation factors and genes involved in protein ubiquitination, suggests that such mechanisms may also be involved in the observed resistance of s. frugiperda to lufenuron as demonstrated in the response of other organisms exposed to toxicants .

despite a great portion of the differentially expressed transcripts was not functionally characterized, our results reveal the complexity of adaptive processes resulting from the selection pressure from the continuous exposure to lufenuron. the increase in the number of genomic-based studies associated with insect resistance has strengthened the notion that insect resistance to various insecticides can be related to polygenic and/or epigenetic factors  <cit> , as is the case of the strain we have analyzed  <cit> .

there have been a number of studies looking at the mode of action and on the possible resistance mechanisms of insects to benzoylphenylureas, including lufenuron, but no mechanism has been clearly demonstrated yet  <cit> . many studies have argued that resistance could arise from an elevated activity of the enzymes involved in chitin processing , but we did not observe significant changes in the expression of enzymes involved either in chitin synthesis  or chitin degradation . some have also argued that resistance could be involved with the production of cuticle proteins  <cit> . in fact, we did detect up-regulation of transcripts associated with rr- <dig> cuticle proteins, l_1615_t_6/ <dig> , l_13_t_1/ <dig> , l_13_t_11/ <dig>  and l_623_t_2/ <dig> , but all of them are proteins associated with more flexible regions of the cuticle  <cit> . these results agree with those observed for diflubenzuron-treated tribolium castaneum , as no changes in the expression levels of chitin synthases and chitinases were observed, although significant changes in the expression of cuticle proteins could be detected  <cit> . our findings and the existing data available suggest that genes involved in chitin metabolism, modification and degradation are not the targets of benzoylphenylureas. despite of the resistance of tetranychus urticae to etoxazole was associated with mutations in conserved regions of the chitin synthase gene  <cit> , we did not detect mutations in this gene in the luf-r strain of s. frugiperda.

alterations in the expression levels or mutations in the lufenuron receptor could also explain the resistance to lufenuron observed in the luf-r strain of s. frugiperda. the lufenuron receptor remains to be described, but abo-elghar et al.  <cit>  indicated the abcc transporter sulfonylurea receptor  as the receptor for benzoylphenylurea due to the structural similarities of benzoylphenylurea and sulfonylurea. however, we did not detect any abcc transporter or sulfonylurea receptor-like transcript in our transcriptomic analysis. yet, the role of sur as a sulfonylurea has been recently challenged, as this receptor was demonstrated to be dispensable for chitin synthesis in drosophila melanogaster , suggesting on the existence of an alternative sulfonylurea-sensitive abc transporter to be involved with chitin synthesis and cuticle formation  <cit> . therefore, we discarded this receptor as a possible mechanism of resistance in the luf-r s. frugiperda strain.

in vitro studies have indicated benzoylphenylureas act through inhibition of the incorporation of n-acetylglucosamine  into chitin in an ecdysteroid-dependent manner  <cit> . we did not find consistent changes in the expression of ecdysteroidogenic genes in between luf-s and luf-r strains of s. frugiperda that would suggest regulation of ecdysteroid synthesis, but we did observed a lower expression of ecdysteroid-22-kinase. this enzyme is involved in ecdysteroid inactivation in silkworm adult ovaries  <cit> , suggesting that luf-r larvae would retain higher titers of active ecdysteroids. nevertheless, we did not observe any indication on differential production or incorporation of udp-n-acetylglucosamine into chitin, as no changes in gene expression of udp-n-acetylglucosamine diphosphorylases  or of chitin synthase  were detected. altogether, we did not find enough support to suggest the ecdysteroid-mediated regulation of glcnac synthesis or incorporation into chitin as a possible mechanism of resistance for the lufenuron-resistant s. frugiperda strain.

it has been demonstrated that benzoylphenylureas may affect cuticle formation in a concentration-dependent manner, with lower doses affecting cuticle thickness and microfibril orientation, while higher doses completely disrupt chitin synthesis  <cit> . the reported effects of benzoylphenylurea on the orientation and synthesis of chitin in the cuticle suggest an effect through disruption of the circadian clock involved in chitin secretion and deposition during cuticle formation  <cit> , but we did not find evidence on the participation of clock genes as a mechanism of resistance to lufenuron in the luf-r strain of s. frugiperda as well. we did though observe udp-glucosyltransferases that were highly expressed in the luf-r strain , an enzyme that is involved with the process of chitin synthesis. however, recent progress due to large scale genomic sequencing has demonstrated udp-glucosyltransferases form a multigenic family in insects  <cit> . the diversity of udp-glucosyltransferases in lepidopterans have also indicated their contribution in the process of detoxification through glycosylation  <cit> , and there are several indications in which an increase in the expression level of ugts have been related to insect resistance to insects such ddt  <cit>  and carbamate  <cit> . however, one other udp-glucosyltransferase  highly similar to ugt40r <dig> was down regulated in the luf-r strain, but ugt40r <dig> has been reported to be an udp-glucosyltransferases exclusively associated with chemoreceptors present in insect antennae  <cit> .

our differential expression analysis between luf-s and luf-r s. frugiperda larvae identified a large number of transcripts associated with p <dig>  gsts and cces, of which many were overexpressed in luf-r larvae. detoxification of insecticides has been widely reported as one of the main mechanisms of insect adaptations to the high selective pressure exerted by insecticides  <cit> . enzymes coded by genes from cytochrome p <dig>  gsts and cces are widely associated with the resistance mechanisms of insects to pesticides because of the degradation, detoxification and/or sequestration of xenobiotics  <cit> . the up-regulation of p <dig> enzymes and carboxylases, in addition to glycosyltransferases, sulfotransferases and glutathione-s-transferases, was recently demonstrated in a functional genomic analysis of a population of tribolium castaneum contaminated with diflubenzuron, corroborating their association with the detoxification of xenobiotics  <cit> .

a higher number of p <dig> monooxygenases was observed among the ests with higher relative expression. p <dig> monooxygenases have been one of the main classes of enzymes associated with lepidopteran resistance to insecticides such as pyrethroids  <cit> , organophosphates  <cit>  and diamides  <cit> . several studies have been conducted aiming to evaluate the activity of these enzymes at the toxicological level  <cit> . their role in insecticide degradation has been demonstrated by observed increased mortality of resistant populations of s. frugiperda to pyrethroids, organophosphates and carbamates when exposed mainly to monooxygenase inhibitors  <cit> . the role of cyps in lufenuron detoxification has also been suggested, as cyp12a <dig> was up-regulated in a population of drosophila melanogaster resistant to lufenuron, suggesting that the enzymes from cytochrome p <dig> play a key role in the resistance against this insecticide.

the finding of multiple overexpressed cyp families in luf-r larvae also points for their role in the resistance of s. frugiperda to lufenuron. cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> are p <dig> families that have been argued as one of the mechanisms involved in lepidopteran resistance to insecticides . the high expression levels associated with the genes encoding detoxification enzymes, even in the absence of insecticide, show that the high expression of these genes occurs constitutively.

the metabolism of insecticides in insects certainly involves a series of complex metabolic processes. even though the biochemical processes related to the detoxification are well described, there are important gaps related to the physiological and molecular mechanisms that govern the detoxification process  <cit> . we were able to demonstrate the overexpression of genes involved in the functionalization  and conjugation , but not of genes involved in the excretion  of xenobiotics in the process of lufenuron detoxification in the luf-r strain of s. frugiperda  <cit> . this may indicate that the process of detoxification of lufenuron can mainly occur within the lumen of the gut.

the diverse gene expression profile between luf-s and luf-r strains indicate resistance also affects several other pathways, which may be related with the resistance fitness costs or may represent an additional mechanism to contribute with resistance of the luf-r s. frugiperda to lufenuron. therefore, there is the need for studies that provide a better understanding of the metabolic pathways adjacent to the classical detoxification pathways  <cit> . for many years, studies of the resistance mechanisms of insects to insecticides were scarce. however, the advance of sequencing technologies and the ability to generate large volumes of information have provided a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the processes that lead to the resistance of insects to insecticides  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
gene expression of luf-r larvae of s. frugiperda is much higher than of luf-s in general, and particularly of those genes involved the detoxification process, including cyp, cce and gst. we concluded that the high abundance of highly expressed cyp genes in the resistant as compared to the susceptible strain is one of the major mechanisms involved in resistance of s. frugiperda to lufenuron.
