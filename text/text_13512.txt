BACKGROUND
adiponectin is a relatively large  cytokine normally produced by the fat tissue and found in human serum at concentrations of 2- <dig> μg/ml  <cit> . circulating adiponectin levels are inversely correlated with body mass index   <cit> . adiponectin is considered a protective hormone exhibiting beneficial effects against insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory conditions, and cancer  <cit> .

adiponectin circulates in trimeric, hexameric, and higher order complexes  <cit> . the c-terminal half of protein representing the globular domain  exhibits potent metabolic effects in various tissues  <cit> . two adiponectin receptors have been identified, adipor <dig> and adipor <dig>  both receptors are 7-channel integral membrane proteins containing an n-terminal intracellular portion and a c-terminal extracellular-transmembrane domain  <cit> . adipor <dig> is a high-affinity receptor for gad and a low affinity receptor for the full-size ligand  <cit> . adipor <dig> has  <dig> very short extracellular domains composed of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> residues, respectively  <cit> .

the major intracellular signal induced by adiponectin is the energy-sensing amp-activated protein kinase  pathway  <cit> . however, some adiponectin-dependent effects appear to be ampk-independent  <cit> . in addition, adiponectin can modulate in a tissue context-dependent manner several other signaling effectors, such as extracellular-signal-regulated kinases  <dig> and  <dig> , p <dig> kinase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α , stress-responsive c-jun n-terminal kinase , wnt receptor, nitric oxide , signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig>  factor, nuclear factor-κb , and ceramide  <cit> . targeted disruption experiments suggested that adipor <dig> transmits signals mainly through ampk, while adipor <dig> acts through pparα-related pathways  <cit> .

recent evidence implicated adiponectin in the prevention of cancer  <cit> . epidemiological studies found an inverse correlation between adiponectin and the risk of developing several obesity-related malignancies, including cancers of the breast, endometrium, colon, and prostate  <cit> . the best-documented associations in breast cancer show that adiponectin levels are reduced in cancer patients vs. controls  <cit> , and low adiponectin levels correlate with more aggressive tumors and higher frequency of lymph node metastasis  <cit> . in agreement with this, in vitro studies demonstrated that adiponectin or its globular form can inhibit the proliferation of breast, colorectal and prostate cancer cells  <cit> .

depending on the experimental model, cytostatic/apoptotic effects of adiponectin can be associated with an increased activation of ampk, reduced erk1/ <dig> signaling  <cit> , inhibition of the akt kinase and glycogen synthase kinase/β-catenin pathway  <cit> , and/or enhanced expression of bax and p <dig> pro-apoptotic genes  <cit> . in addition, adiponectin can also reduce cancer cell migration and invasion  <cit> . in animal models, adiponectin suppresses the growth of t47d and mda-mb- <dig> breast cancer xenografts, and in some cases, inhibits tumor neoangiogenesis  <cit> .

the adiponectin receptors, adipor <dig> and adipor <dig>  have been detected in human breast cancer specimens, but not clearly associated with other biomarkers  <cit> . adipor <dig> appears to play a more definite role in breast cancer, as adiponectin-dependent antiproliferative effects are abolished by sirna knockdown of this receptor  <cit> . however, in colon cancer cells, both adipor <dig> and adipor <dig> can transmit cytostatic effects  <cit> . while data on adipor1/ <dig> expression in other malignancies are limited, the receptors have been found in normal colon and colon cancer tissue  <cit>  as well as in gastrointestinal stromal tumors  <cit> .

although some anti-diabetic drugs   <cit>  as well as caloric restriction  <cit>  can partially mimic adiponectin action and induce ampk signaling in cancer tissues, specific and selective compounds targeting adipor still await development. at present, adiponectin-based therapeutics are not available, partly due to difficulties in converting the full size adiponectin protein into a viable drug. here we report on the design and initial preclinical development of adiponectin-based peptide compounds acting as adipor agonists in cancer cells.

methods
initial model building
the three-dimensional  structure of the globular domain  of human adiponectin was obtained with the yasara molecular modeling package   <cit> . the hm_build.mcr macro of the yasara package with default parameters, except the maximum oligomerization state set to one, was used to build the model. yasara identified a protein with protein databank   <cit>  i.d. 1c3h, which corresponds to a murine isoform of adiponectin, as a sole template. the model was subjected to further refinement using the md_refine.mcr macro of yasara and to  <dig> ns constant temperature  and pressure  molecular dynamics  simulations using the amber <dig> force field. simulation parameters were kept at the values defined by the macro. the structure of the protein was simulated in an  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> nm rectangular box with periodic boundaries and endcapping with an n-acetyl protecting group to preserve the electronic structure of the backbone. the box containing the protein was filled with  <dig> water molecules,  <dig> cl- and  <dig> na+ ions. the final structure from the simulation was used as a starting parameter to structure calculations of peptide  <dig> and its derivative, adp  <dig> 

detailed molecular dynamics simulations of peptides
md simulations were performed with the gromacs  <dig> . <dig> software package  <cit>  using the opls-aa/l force field  <cit> . peptides were solvated with  <dig> water molecules and one chloride ion to neutralize the charge of the system. the solvated structures were energy minimized by the steepest descent method. simulations ran for  <dig> ps at  <dig> k. at  <dig>  ns the simulations continued at  <dig> bar pressure by coupling the system to external heat and pressure bath. snapshots of the trajectories were saved at every  <dig>  ns. the first  <dig>  ns point was considered as equilibration period and was not used for subsequent analysis. a reaction-field correction was used for long-range electrostatic interactions, and an energy dispersion correction was implemented. trajectories were submitted to cluster analysis using the gromos method  <cit> . peptide conformations were examined using the middle structure of the largest cluster and using the dssp program  <cit> . the root-mean-square deviation  of the backbone of the peptide structures was calculated using the g_rms utility of gromacs.

peptide array
a panel of  <dig> overlapping peptides, each  <dig> amino acid-long, covering the entire globular domain of the human adiponectin protein was synthesized on a β-alanine derivatized cleavable cellulose membrane  <cit> . each consecutive peptide was shifted by  <dig> residues along the sequence. another panel of  <dig> peptides representing analogs of the  <dig> original peptides was assembled on the same membrane support. in these 10-residue-long overlapping peptides, residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the first array were replaced with non-natural amino acids. the substituting amino acids were norvaline for aliphatic residues, d-asparagine for residues with amide-side chain, d-serine for hydroxy-amino acids, d-lysine for cationic residues and 1-amino cyclopentane carboxylic acid for aromatic residues and proline. all peptide sequences are listed in additional file  <dig> 

the peptides were assembled by fmoc-synthesis techniques  <cit> , individually cut from the solid support and cleaved from the cellulose membrane by using 2% aqueous triethyl amine overnight  <cit> . peptides 23- <dig> and their modified analogs were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography  and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy .

synthesis and purification of individual peptides
the adiponectin-based peptide  <dig>  a six-residue middle fragment of peptide  <dig>  and peptidomimetic adp  <dig> as well as biotin-labeled analogs of the adipor <dig> extracellular loops were synthesized on the solid-phase by using a cem liberty microwave-assisted peptide synthesizer and utilizing fmoc-chemistry  <cit> . biotin was coupled to the peptide while still attached the solid-phase carrier. after cleavage with 95% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid  containing 2% thioanisole, the peptides were purified by rp-hplc. maldi-ms verified the high purity of the peptide preparations. after purification, adp  <dig> was lyophilized twice from 2% aqueous acetic acid solution prior to cellular efficacy studies.

screening of adipor1/peptide binding
the  <dig> unmodified adiponectin array peptides were individually dried down to wells of an elisa plate, and tested for binding to biotin-labeled linear synthetic models of the  <dig> extracellular loops of adipor <dig>  the receptor/peptide interaction was detected by horseradish-peroxidase conjugated streptavidin.

in vitro screening of adiponectin-based peptides
biological activity of the peptides was first assessed using mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells that are known to express adipor <dig>  <cit> . mcf- <dig> cell line was obtained from atcc  and routinely grown in dmem:f <dig> plus 5% calf serum  at 37°c, 5% co <dig>  for screening experiments, mcf- <dig> cells were plated in 24-well plates at the concentration of  <dig>  cells/well. after  <dig> h of culture in the growth medium, the cells were synchronized in serum-free medium   for  <dig> h, and then shifted back to the full growth medium containing either gad  at  <dig> ng/ml, individual peptides, or no test compounds. after  <dig> h, the cells were counted under the microscope with trypan-blue exclusion. each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times.

the array-extracted peptides  solubilized at 65°c for  <dig> min were tested at an approximate concentration of 8- <dig> ng/ml. in addition, the following peptides:  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> were further purified by rp-hplc and screened together with the individually synthesized adiponectin peptides at the exact concentration of  <dig> ng/ml.

cell growth experiments
the effects of the lead active peptide  <dig>  on cell proliferation were tested in breast cancer cell lines  and in glioblastoma cells , all obtained from atcc and routinely cultured as described previously  <cit> . the peptide was tested at  <dig> pm- <dig> μm concentrations under conditions described above under peptide screening.

detection of adipor <dig> and adipor <dig> and signaling analysis
adipor <dig> and adipor <dig> were detected by western immunoblotting  using  <dig> μg of total proteins isolated from growing cell cultures, as described by us previously  <cit>  using goat polyclonal adipor <dig> m <dig> ab and goat polyclonal adipor <dig> c <dig> ab .

signaling analysis was performed using mcf- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> breast cancer cells and ln <dig> glioblastoma cells. the cells at 70-80% confluence were shifted to sfm for  <dig> h, then sfm was removed, the cultures were washed  <dig> x with pbs, placed in normal growth medium for  <dig> h, and then treated with adp  <dig> at  <dig> nm  or  <dig> μm  for 0- <dig> min, while gad at  <dig> ng/ml was applied for  <dig> min only. untreated cells were used as negative control. after the treatment, the cells were lysed, as previously described  <cit>  and  <dig> μg of proteins were analyzed by wb for the expression of phosphorylated  and total forms of several signaling molecules. the following primary abs from cell signaling  were used: 1) pampkα  d <dig> e rabbit mab 1: 750; 2) total ampkα rabbit mab 1:1000; 3) p44/ <dig> mapk  rabbit mab 1:1000; 4) total 44/ <dig> map kinase rabbit mab 1:1000; 5) pstat <dig>  d3a <dig> rabbit mab 1: 500; 6) total stat <dig> 79d <dig> rabbit mab 1:2000; 7) pakt  rabbit mab 1:1000; 8) total akt rabbit mab 1: <dig>  protein loading was verified by evaluating the expression of a constitutive enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  using 6c <dig> mabs 1: <dig> . the following secondary abs  were used where appropriate: 1) donkey anti-goat igg-hrp; 2) goat anti-mouse igg-hrp; 3) goat anti-rabbit igg-hrp, all applied at 1: <dig> dilution. the intensity of specific protein bands was quantified by the imagej software . the ratio of phosphorylated to total levels was calculated for each protein, and expressed as % change vs. untreated controls .

sirna experiments
mcf- <dig> cells expressing approximately equal levels of adipor <dig> and adipor <dig> were used to assess the contribution of each receptor in the response to adp <dig>  adipor <dig> and adipor <dig> sirna as well scrambled sirna were purchased from santa cruz biotechnology. dilution of sirna reagents and transfection of cells was performed following the manufacturer's protocol. for growth experiments, the cells were plated in 24-well plates at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/well and transfected with  <dig> μl of  <dig> μm stock sirna. for wb, the cells were grown in  <dig> mm plates at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/plate and transfected with  <dig> μl of  <dig> μm stock sirna. the cells were processed for wb or treated with adp <dig> at  <dig> h following transfection.

peptide stability in mouse blood and mouse serum
sixty μg of adp  <dig> were dissolved in  <dig> μl water, and  <dig> μl aliquots were mixed with  <dig> μl of freshly drawn mouse blood. after  <dig> min of incubation at 37°c, blood cells were centrifuged at  <dig>  × g. fifty μl serum was mixed with  <dig> μl phosphate buffered saline ph  <dig>  , and serum proteins were precipitated by addition of  <dig> μl aqueous 15% trichloroacetic acid  for  <dig> min at 4°c. after centrifugation at  <dig>  × g, the supernatant was neutralized with  <dig>  m aqueous sodium hydroxide and  <dig>  μl of this solution was mixed with  <dig>  μl α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid  as matrix on a sample plate. analysis was performed using a maldi time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer . additionally, the neutralized supernatant was loaded on a jupiter c <dig> rp-hplc column  previously calibrated with known amounts of adp  <dig> dissolved in pbs. absorbance was measured at  <dig> nm.

adp  <dig> was also incubated at 37°c with 25% aqueous mouse serum at a final concentration of  <dig> μg/ml. after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> min,  <dig> μl aliquots were mixed with  <dig> μl 15% aqueous tca and were incubated for  <dig> min at 4°c. sample analysis followed the protocols described above.

in vivo activity of adp  <dig> in an orthotopic xenograft breast cancer model
ten 8-week-old female immunocompromised  mice  were anesthetized to allow the implantation of  <dig>  ×  <dig> mcf- <dig> cells into the two inguinal mammary glands. when tumors were palpable in all animals , the mice were divided into  <dig> groups containing animals with comparable tumor sizes. one group of  <dig> mice was treated daily with  <dig> mg/kg peptide adp  <dig> intraperitoneally , while the other group of  <dig> mice reminded untreated. after  <dig> days of treatment, the animals were killed by co <dig> inhalation, and tumors were carefully removed, photographed and weighed. all vertebrate animals of this study were maintained and handled in accordance with the recommendations of the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and were approved by the animal care committee of semmelweis university .

in vivo toxicity
adp  <dig> was injected into  <dig> groups of three 10- <dig> week old female cba/j mice. bolus ip doses were administered at  <dig> mg/kg,  <dig> mg/kg,  <dig> mg/kg or  <dig> mg/kg in sterile saline and the animals were observed for signs of systemic toxicity  for  <dig> days. on day  <dig>  the mice were sacrificed by co <dig> inhalation. the potential peptide elimination organs: the livers, spleens and kidneys were removed and weighed. all procedures for vertebrate animal experiments were approved by the animal health and food control committee of budapest, protocol number 399/033/ <dig> 

RESULTS
identification of the active site of adiponectin protein
the peptides extracted from the array were tested for cytostatic activity in adiponectin sensitive mcf- <dig> cells  <cit> . in control experiments, we used gad at  <dig> ng/ml, a concentration that induced maximal growth inhibition in our dose response experiments in mcf- <dig> cells  and has previously been described as cytostatic in breast cancer cells  <cit> . peptides 23- <dig> at  <dig> ng/ml inhibited mcf- <dig> cell proliferation by 19-26% relative to untreated controls, while other peptides, either flanking this domain or distant, were ineffective or produced only minimal  cytostatic effects . gad restricted mcf- <dig> cell growth by ~18% .

the sequence covered by the active peptides 23- <dig> is: h-lys-phe-his-cys-asn-ile-pro-gly-leu-tyr-tyr-phe-ala-tyr-his-ile-thr-val-nh <dig>  and this fragment corresponds to amino acids 149- <dig> of human adiponectin protein .

proposed minimal active site: ile-pro-gly-leu-tyr-tyr-phe-ala

conservative substitutions allowed : x-ile-pro-gly-leu-tyr-tyr-phe-ala-x

the cytostatic activity of original and modified peptides was evaluated in mcf- <dig> cells, as described in methods and was calculated relative to the activity of gad . underlined amino acids indicate the residues where conservative modifications were made. replaceable residues are marked with * and non-replaceable residues are marked with #. x, non-natural amino acid.

according to the currently most accepted model, the globular domain of human adiponectin is a β-barrel-type structure where the β-sheets are connected with ω-loops. the identified active peptides are located on the loop-β-sheet region of the protein . while approximately half of the sequence, covering peptides  <dig> and  <dig>  is located inside the trimer bundle, the n-terminal region falls slightly outside the trimer boundaries. the side-chains of the c-terminal 2/ <dig> of the identified active site are facing outside . the center of the active peptides has homology only with spastin, immunoglobulin and complement proteins according to a blast homology search.

identification of minimal adiponectin active site and development of its pharmacologically improved analogs
next, we generated multiple analogs of peptides 23- <dig> in order to identify the minimal adiponectin active site as well as introduce chemical modifications improving peptide activity and stability. the activities of all analogs at  <dig> ng/ml were determined relative to the effects of  <dig> ng/ml gad .

while peptide  <dig> was fully active in cell growth inhibition assays, its center  <dig> residue-long fragment 157- <dig> did not exhibit any biological activity. therefore, we generated and tested several longer, 10-residue peptides encompassing the 149- <dig> adiponectin stretch. we attempted to identify residues in this region that could be freely replaced with non-natural amino acid analogs in order to improve pharmacological properties of the lead peptides. biological assays identified a highly active short site: ile-pro-gly-leu-tyr-tyr-phe-ala, and further structure-function analysis indicated that conservative substitutions in the minimal active site can be introduced at gly  <dig> and tyr  <dig> residues, without compromising biological activity. additions of non-natural amino acids at n- and c-termini were envisioned to provide stability against exopeptidase cleavage in vitro and in vivo .

identification of adp  <dig> as an optimal adiponectin receptor agonist
biological screening of the analogs of the minimal adiponectin active site resulted in the identification of a peptidomimetic adp  <dig>  as the most promising adiponectin receptor agonist. the compound is based on the precursor peptide  <dig> and contains the minimal active site with allowed modifications .

adp  <dig> inhibits the growth of adipor1/adipor2-positive cancer cell lines
in a preliminary, qualitative study, we examined the interaction of peptide  <dig> to biotin-labeled fragments of the  <dig> adipor <dig> extracellular loops. the peptide bound the first extracellular loop of adipor <dig>  but not other loops . blast analysis identified an 86% homology between the first loops of adipor <dig> and adipor <dig>  suggesting that adp  <dig> potentially can interact with both receptors.

dose-dependent effects of adp  <dig> were tested in different cancer cells lines expressing adipor <dig> and adipor <dig>  the highest levels of adipor <dig> were found in mcf- <dig> cells, while the receptor was less abundant in mda-mb- <dig> and ln <dig> cells . on the other hand, adipor <dig> was undetectable in mda-mb- <dig> cells, and expressed at intermediate and high levels in ln <dig> and mcf- <dig> cells, respectively. preliminary experiments suggested that all cell lines are sensitive to gad, and the maximal growth inhibition can be achieved with gad at 50- <dig> ng/ml .

in all cell lines, adp  <dig> restricted normal cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. in mcf- <dig> cells, the best growth inhibition was achieved with adp  <dig> at  <dig> nm- <dig> μm, while  <dig> pm- <dig> nm concentrations were less effective . in mda-mb- <dig> and ln  <dig> cells, the maximal growth inhibition was noted at  <dig> μm. in all cell lines, adp  <dig> at maximal effective doses produced greater cytostatic effects then gad at  <dig> ng/ml .

effects of adipor <dig> or adipor <dig> downregulation on adp <dig> activity
to assess the contribution of adipor <dig> and adipor <dig> in mediating adp  <dig> effects, we selectively downregulated the expression of each receptor in mcf- <dig> cells using sirna technology. the decrease of adipor <dig> by ~60% reduced adp  <dig> activity by 52%, while downregulation of adipor <dig> by 90% diminished adp  <dig> effects by 20% . these results suggested that the peptide can transmit signals through both receptors, but the majority of activity was mediated through adipor <dig>  of note, adipor2-negative mda-mb- <dig> cells exhibited sensitivity to gad and adp <dig>  suggesting that adipor <dig> was sufficient to activate the response.

adp  <dig> differentially modulates adipor signaling pathways
we examined the effects of adp  <dig> on different adiponectin signaling pathways in mcf- <dig>  mda-mb- <dig>  and ln <dig> cells . the peptide was used at concentrations that produced maximal cytostatic effects and the treatment was carried out for 0- <dig> min.

remarkably, depending on cell line, adp  <dig> exerted differential signaling effects. in mcf- <dig> cells, the peptide increased the phosphorylation of ampk at  <dig> and  <dig> min and decreased erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation at 30- <dig> min. adp  <dig> did not significantly affect the activation of akt in these cells, but it increased the phosphorylation of stat <dig> at 15- <dig> min . in mda-mb- <dig> cells, the major pathway affected by adp  <dig> was erk1/ <dig>  which was measurably inhibited at 15- <dig> min of treatment. the peptide transiently increased stat <dig> phosphorylation at  <dig> and  <dig> min. in mda-mb- <dig> cells, adp  <dig> did not stimulate ampk activation, while akt phosphorylation was moderately activated at 30- <dig> min. in ln <dig> cells, adp  <dig> decreased stat <dig> phosphorylation at 15- <dig> min and dramatically downregulated total levels of akt at 15- <dig> min. however, the peptide did not significantly affect ampk in these cells. in all cell lines, gad regulated signaling pathways similar to adp  <dig>  however its effects were usually less pronounced .

adp  <dig> exhibits superior stability in mouse serum and blood
calculating from the degradation rate measured in 25% aqueous serum  <cit> , adp  <dig> had a  <dig> min half-life in mouse serum . in whole mouse blood, the peptide was present even after  <dig> min without noticeable degradation .

adp  <dig> inhibits the growth of mcf- <dig> xenografts in immunocompromised mice
the efficacy of adp <dig> was assessed in mcf- <dig> orthotopic xenograft model. the peptidomimetic was injected ip into scid mice carrying palpable mcf- <dig> xenografts at a  <dig> mg/kg/day dose. after  <dig> days of treatment, the mice were sacrificed and tumors removed. due to variability in tumor sizes, the largest and smallest lesions from each group were excluded from the evaluation. figure  <dig> shows the remaining  <dig> tumor lesions . the total tumor weight in untreated animals was  <dig>  g , and in adp 355-treated animals  <dig>  g . thus, adp  <dig> therapy reduced established tumor growth by 31% , relative to untreated controls.

preliminary assessment of adp  <dig> toxicity in vivo
healthy mice receiving up to  <dig> mg/kg peptide adp  <dig> ip showed no signs of systemic toxicity. four days after peptide administration the potential peptide elimination organs were removed and weighed. while the spleens of treated and untreated animals were identical in size, the kidney and liver weights were slightly increased in treated mice relative to total body weight at the highest dose of  <dig> mg/kg . since peptide drugs undergo renal and hepatic clearance  <cit> , an increase of the elimination organ size might indicate the active metabolic processes. in addition, adipor1/ <dig>  as physiological targets of adiponectin, are found in the liver, and might respond to agonist treatment  <cit> . however, these limited toxic effects were not observed below the  <dig> mg/kg dose, a magnitude higher than the therapy dose, identifying adp  <dig> as a safe treatment option.

cba/j mice were treated with adp  <dig> and toxicity parameters were assessed as described in methods.

discussion
numerous epidemiological and experimental studies provided evidence linking obesity to an increased risk of developing different malignancies, including breast, colorectal, prostate and endometrial cancers  <cit> . in addition, calorie-rich diet has been shown to induce inflammatory responses in microglia cells, which potentially can promote development of brain neoplasms  <cit> .

in obese individuals, especially in those with high visceral fat content, adiponectin levels are low  <cit> . according to epidemiological studies, low adiponectin levels are associated with elevated cancer risk and development of more aggressive neoplasms  <cit> . how exactly adiponectin might prevent or restrict cancer is yet not clear. the relevant mechanisms could involve activation of intracellular metabolic changes similar to those produced by calorie restriction, i.e., stimulation of intracellular signals, such as ampk, and inhibition of abnormal growth and survival pathways  <cit> . thus, pharmacological activation of adiponectin signaling in obese individuals that are refractory to lifestyle modifications could help to restore beneficial pathways normally controlled by this adipokine.

however, development of the whole adiponectin protein as a drug is difficult because of the extreme insolubility of the c-terminal globular domain and its larger peptide fragments. in addition, until now, the adiponectin active site has not been mapped. consequently, we attempted to generate small peptides that would produce biological effects similar or superior to that of gad, but would be suitable for pharmaceutical modifications.

first, using peptide arrays and biological screening assays, we mapped the adiponectin active site to amino acids 149- <dig> within the globular domain of the whole adipokine . in parallel experiments, we found that peptides covering the active site displayed high affinity to an extended version of the adipor <dig> loop  <dig>  that shares 86% homology with the loop  <dig> in adipor <dig>  further modifications of the active site, followed by structure-function screening resulted in the development of the lead peptidomimetic, adp  <dig>  as optimal adipor agonist.

the identified active site of adiponectin can be characterized as a turn region followed by a β-pleated sheet fragment . when removed from the protein environment, md studies indicated that the isolated native peptide  <dig> loses the β-pleated sheet character and forms a series of turns . during md simulations, the initial turn- β-sheet structures of both peptide  <dig> and adp  <dig> peptides were substantially changed and showed high flexibility. the backbone rmsd values fluctuated with high frequency between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm. however, in the case of adp  <dig>  from  <dig> ns to  <dig> ns, the rmsd remained around  <dig>  nm, indicting that the peptidomimetic folded into a more stable conformation characterized by a hairpin incorporating almost the entire peptide. in the cluster analysis, the most populated cluster of the peptidomimetic contained more than twice as many structures as the native fragment . if the dominant β-hairpin structure is indeed the active conformation, the significantly increased population of this conformer can explain the improved in vitro activity of adp  <dig> relative to that of its precursor peptide  <dig> 

functional assays with adp  <dig> demonstrated that the peptide restricts cancer cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner at  <dig> nm- <dig> μm concentrations. in all studied cell lines, this growth inhibition was superior to that obtained with gad . cytostatic activity of adp  <dig> is in agreement with several other reports showing similar effects of adiponectin or gad in cancer models  <cit> . however, some studies failed to demonstrate any anti-neoplastic activity of this adipokine  <cit> . these discrepancies likely reflect differences in experimental design as well as cell context, including differential levels of adipor1/ <dig> and signaling proteins. indeed, our work clearly suggests that the levels of adipor <dig> and adipor <dig> vary among cell lines. some previous reports suggested that cytostatic effects of adiponectin in breast cancer cells are primarily mediated through adipor <dig>  <cit> , and our results with adipor2-negative cells and adipor2-knockdown cells confirm this notion.

our signaling studies further confirmed that cell response to adiponectin or its derivatives may be cell-specific. we demonstrated that cytostatic effects adp  <dig> coincided with the modulation of specific adiponectin signals that have been associated with growth or survival control, i.e., ampk, akt, erk1/ <dig>  and stat <dig>  interestingly, the major metabolic adiponectin pathway--ampk was transiently induced only in mcf- <dig> cells, while in mda-mb- <dig> and ln <dig> cells, the peptide or gad did not have any effects .

in mcf- <dig> cells, adp  <dig>  but not gad, decreased erk1/ <dig> signaling. stat <dig> was activated in this cell line by both adp  <dig> and gad. in mda-mb- <dig> cells, like in mcf- <dig> cells, adp  <dig> decreased erk1/ <dig> activation and transiently increased stat <dig> signaling. in both breast cancer cell lines, adp  <dig> did not affect the major growth/survival akt pathway. in contrast, adp  <dig> and gad significantly inhibited akt and stat <dig> signals in ln <dig> cells. interestingly, the effects on akt concerned total levels of the enzyme, suggesting that adp  <dig> might affect its turnover.

published data on adiponectin signaling in cancer cells seem to support the notion that the cytokine might induce different signaling pathways in different cell lines. for instance, in many cancer cell lines  adiponectin activated ampk  <cit> . on the other hand, adiponectin either reduced or did not affect erk1/ <dig> in mcf- <dig> or mda-mb- <dig> cells, but stimulated the pathway in some colorectal cancer cell lines  <cit> . akt was inhibited by adiponectin in mda-mb- <dig> breast cancer cells, but activated in prostate cancer cells lncap  <cit> . the upregulation of ampk and reduction of akt in response to adiponectin in mda-mb- <dig> cells  <cit>  is in contrast with our study and might be related to significantly lower gad and adp  <dig> concentrations used in our experiments, while high doses used by kim et al. were toxic in our system. consistent with our results, moderate stat <dig> stimulation by adiponectin was noted in mda-mb- <dig> cells, while the transcription factor was inhibited in du <dig> prostate cancer cells  <cit> . these differences, in part, could reflect variable experimental settings, such as baseline growth conditions, adiponectin reagents used as well as treatment timing and dosage.

to further assess the efficacy of adp  <dig>  we carried out a preliminary in vivo study. in scid mice carrying mcf- <dig> orthotopic xenografts, adp  <dig> treatment reduced the growth of established tumors by ~31%, validating adipor as a target for breast cancer therapy.

CONCLUSIONS
here we report on the design and development of a first-in-class adipor agonist. adipor agonists are viewed as future drugs to treat multiple diseases related to obesity and insulin resistance. the biological activity of our novel adp  <dig>  including its in vivo efficacy, its superior stability in biological fluids, as well as acceptable toxicity profile and low production costs indicate that the peptidomimetic represents a true lead compound for ensuing pharmaceutical development.
