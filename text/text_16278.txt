BACKGROUND
over the past few decades, north america has seen a rapid increase in the number of south american camelids raised for fiber, show and companionship. along with the increase in animal numbers has come an increase in interest for veterinary care and appropriate drug therapies for these animals. to date, however, there are no drugs currently approved by the food and drug administration for use in camelids in the united states. thus, extra-label use of common veterinary therapeutic drugs in camelids is routine in practice, yet there generally remains a lack of pharmacokinetic  data in camelids. dosages used have been extrapolated from other large animal species, including cattle, horses, and other small ruminant species. particularly in regards to oral administration and bioavailability of medications, this practice has proven to be inadequate in some of the camelid pharmacokinetic studies published to date  <cit> . in addition, although not common practice in the united states, llama meat is available for purchase through various outlets. if this market were to expand, scientific data on drug withdrawal time in llamas are currently lacking to ensure the safety of this non-traditional food supply.

non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  are commonly utilized in large animal veterinary practice for relief of pain, fever, and inflammation. increasing public awareness of animal welfare will likely continue to make proper use of nsaids a priority in the treatment of all domestic animals for painful inflammatory conditions. therefore, knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of nsaids in the specific species of interest will be required to provide for safe and efficacious use. previous studies have been completed evaluating the pharmacokinetics of the nsaids flunixin meglumine  <cit> , ketoprofen  <cit> , and phenylbutazone  <cit>  in llamas, however, studies investigating the pharmacokinetics, in camelids, of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs considered to be cyclooxygenase- <dig>  selective are deficient in the published literature. in general, the beneficial therapeutic actions of nsaids are thought to be related to inhibition of cox- <dig>  and the undesirable side effects such as gastrointestinal ulceration due to non-selective inhibition of both cox isoforms <cit> . thus, the ability to utilize a cox- <dig> selective nsaid in a field setting for management of pain and inflammation may be desirable.

meloxicam is an nsaid of the oxicam class which exerts its effect via selective inhibition of the cox- <dig> enzyme, thereby preventing prostaglandin synthesis which can lead to pain, fever and inflammation. meloxicam is approved for use in cattle in the european union  as adjunctive therapy for acute respiratory disease, diarrhea and acute mastitis  <cit> , and in canada for alleviation of pain at debudding and improved performance in calves with diarrhea <cit> . in companion animals meloxicam is approved in the eu, united states, and canada for use in dogs for treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis and cats for control of perioperative pain  <cit> . in addition, meloxicam has been shown in cattle to effectively suppress the inflammatory response to experimental endotoxin administration  <cit> . the availability of an oral formulation of meloxicam makes it particularly attractive for field use in treatment of inflammatory conditions.

as the pharmacokinetics of meloxicam in llamas have not been reported to date in the published literature, the objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of iv and oral meloxicam administration, and from this data determine the oral bioavailability in llamas. if oral meloxicam results in plasma concentrations comparable to that of parenteral administration, it may provide a practical and cost-effective method for relief of pain and inflammation in llamas.

RESULTS
no adverse effects were noted after iv or oral meloxicam administration. the pharmacokinetic parameters of meloxicam in llamas following iv administration of  <dig>  mg/kg and oral administration at 1 mg/kg are shown in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  following iv administration, meloxicam demonstrated a moderately small mean volume of distribution  of  <dig>  l/kg  and a relatively slow mean clearance  from the central compartment of  <dig>  ml/min/kg . this was associated with a long mean plasma half-life  of  <dig>  hours .

discussion
an ideal anti-inflammatory drug for use in field settings requires the ability for oral administration, does not require multiple doses per day, minimizes the number of administration periods necessary to achieve adequate drug concentrations, and is cost-effective. the purpose of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability of meloxicam in llamas. the results of this study indicate that a mean cmax of  <dig>  μg/ml occurred approximately  <dig>  hours after oral administration. a relatively slow clearance resulted in a t ½ λz of  <dig>  hours. oral meloxicam demonstrated a high degree of gastrointestinal absorption and oral bioavailability when dose normalized in comparison to iv administration. these findings suggest that oral meloxicam may provide an effective means of providing long-lasting analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects to llamas in a field setting once efficacy has been demonstrated.

during the study, one of the llamas exhibited a large increase in weight  between the first treatment  and the second treatment . this increase is considered to be too large for normal weight gain over an 11 day period , thus error in weighing the animal was likely the source of variation. previous hospital records of this animal indicate a weight of  <dig>  kg approximately one month prior to initiation of the trial. therefore, it is highly likely that the weight for the first treatment was recorded as falsely low at  <dig>  kg and that the weight for the second treatment at  <dig>  kg  is the more correct weight of the animal. this animal did consistently exhibit the lowest concentration for all time points when compared to iv administrations in all other animals, which suggests that the iv dosage administered may have been less than the targeted  <dig>  mg/kg . however, the variation in the data was minimal, and there was found to be no statistically significant difference between the calculated mean pharmacokinetic parameters whether data from this animal was included or not included in the final calculations. additionally, as the incorrect weight was determined to be that used for iv administration, this minor discrepancy should not affect the overall evaluation of the data, especially in regards to oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics.

as venous access in llamas is challenging and is generally reserved for direct use by veterinarians, oral administration is the preferred route over intravenous administration in field settings. table  <dig> demonstrates the differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters in llamas of the nsaids that have been reported in the literature to date: meloxicam , flunixin meglumine  <cit> , ketoprofen  <cit> , and phenylbutazone  <cit> . of the four, pk values for oral administration have only been reported for phenylbutazone previously, and now meloxicam, while iv data is available for all four compounds studied. in comparison to oral administration of phenylbutazone, oral meloxicam exhibits similar aucinf and oral bioavailability but reaches tmax much later  and also possesses a much longer half-life  even though plasma drug concentrations are detected within  <dig> minutes of administration. therefore, oral administration of phenylbutazone could potentially provide therapeutic effects more rapidly than meloxicam, however, may not reach plasma levels considered to be therapeutic when compared to those reported in equine pharmacodynamic studies   <cit> . the pharmacokinetic parameters of phenylbutazone also suggest a much shorter duration of effect when compared to meloxicam while requiring more frequent dosing with extended duration dosing regimens. in addition to the potential for oral administration, the ideal nsaid should not require multiple doses per day and should minimize the overall number of administration periods necessary to achieve adequate levels of drug concentration. in this regard, oral meloxicam offers a more desirable pharmacokinetic profile over oral phenylbutazone for longer term nsaid therapy in llamas.

when administered iv, t ½ λz of meloxicam is substantially greater than in other nsaids studied thus far ; this is directly related to a slower clearance rate of meloxicam when compared to the previously studied nsaids . volume of distribution was also greater with meloxicam than with the other nsaids , although all values can be considered to be within the range of a low volume of distribution. most nsaids exhibit a high degree of protein binding which causes relatively low volume of distribution into the interstitial fluids but facilitates passage into areas of inflammation with leakage of plasma proteins into exudate  <cit> . these data suggest that if iv administration is chosen over oral, iv meloxicam will still provide a longer duration of activity than all other nsaids studied thus far in llamas. interestingly, the finding of a longer t ½ λz following oral versus iv meloxicam administration in llamas is similar to the results seen in other ruminant or pseudo-ruminant species studied thus far   <cit> . the elimination half-life is determined by the clearance and the volume of distribution of a drug and is typically the same irrespective of the route of administration. however, in cases where the rate of elimination is faster than the rate of absorption, the terminal slope is not parallel after oral administration because this reflects the absorption half-life rather than the elimination half-life. this is an example of “flip-flop” kinetics and has also been described after oral administration of meloxicam in other ruminants most likely because the rumen delays absorption of the drug from the gastrointestinal tract  <cit> .

the pharmacokinetic parameters of most nsaids have been demonstrated to be species dependent, and meloxicam has proven to be no exception. tables  <dig> and  <dig> list the differences in pharmacokinetic parameters of meloxicam in various domesticated large animal species  <cit> . the most closely related species studied thus far has been camels, however, only iv administration was evaluated in that study. the half-life of oral meloxicam in llamas  appears to be similar to species such as cattle   <cit>  and cats   <cit>  but is much slower than in other species such as goats   <cit>  and dogs   <cit> . in contrast, tmax exhibits extreme variation, with llamas taking the longest time to reach maximum concentration  and horses the shortest   <cit> . in addition to formulation, one important factor that has been suggested to affect the availability of nsaids for absorption, alter tmax and increase half-life in herbivores is binding of the drugs to hay and digesta; however this affect was shown to vary considerably with the specific drug studied  <cit> . a recent study comparing the pharmacokinetics in ruminant calves fed grass hay versus pre-ruminant calves fed milk replacer and calf starter showed no statistically significant difference in the tmax or t ½ λz between ruminant and non-ruminant diets  <cit> . in addition to anatomic differences and types of feed provided, differing ph of the stomach compartments in ruminant  and non-ruminant animals may serve to affect the site, and thus the timing, of meloxicam absorption, as absorption is favored in relatively acidic areas of the gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . in addition, certain species-specific factors, such as increased drug metabolism, may also play a key role in determining pharmacokinetic differences.

in the present study, the half-life of iv meloxicam was  <dig>  hrs, which falls in the middle of the range of half-lives observed in other domestic large animal species   <cit> . the volume of distribution after iv administration was  <dig>  l/kg, which is towards the higher end of the range within the species reported   <cit>  but is still considered to be a relatively low volume of distribution consistently observed with most nsaids. the aucinf in llamas of  <dig>  hr*μg/ml was higher than that reported in goats   <cit>  but lower than that reported in cattle   <cit>  given the same dosage of  <dig>  mg/kg. in contrast, however, the aucinf for camels was markedly higher at  <dig>  hr*μg/ml with only a slightly higher dosage of  <dig>  mg/kg iv  <cit> . the extreme variation in aucinf can be attributed to differences in clearance rates between species which range from  <dig>  ml/min/kg in camels  <cit>  to  <dig>  ml/min/kg in goats  <cit> , and underscores the need for pharmacokinetic studies in the species of interest to determine accurate estimates of drug concentrations after administration.

the actual therapeutic concentration range in llamas for meloxicam, as well as all other nsaids, is unknown. target ranges for pain relief due to experimentally induced arthritis in horses based on the estimated ec <dig> value  have been suggested to be > <dig>  μg/ml  <cit>  which may allow for cautious extrapolation that this concentration may provide similar therapeutic pain relief benefits in llamas. at an oral dose of 1 mg/kg, concentrations of > <dig>  μg/ml are maintained for at least  <dig> hours, suggesting that a single dosage of oral meloxicam at 1 mg/kg could potentially maintain therapeutic concentrations for pain relief in plasma for 2–3 days in adult llamas. utilizing the plasma clearance and the oral bioavailability established in this study and a dose of 1 mg/kg, an average concentration at steady state can be estimated to be  <dig>  ng/ml with daily dosing, and  <dig>  ng/ml when administered every other day. the calculation of the average therapeutic concentrations in plasma during a dose interval in other species from approved maintenance dose and reported clearance values varies from 347 ng/ml in cats, 735 ng/ml in horses to 833 ng/ml in dogs and 1389 ng/ml in humans  <cit> . this variation makes extrapolations of therapeutic concentrations between species difficult. additionally, the potential exists for increased risk of adverse effects due to dose accumulation, especially at once daily dosing. to determine optimal dosing and treatment intervals necessary to ensure adequate tissue concentrations for clinical efficacy, further studies combining pharmacodynamics with pharmacokinetics and safety trials in llamas are recommended. in addition, various stressors such as disease, inflammation, pregnancy, and lactation have all been shown to affect the pharmacokinetics of medications  <cit> , thus the data reported here may not reflect exact pk parameters in diseased states. alternative dosing strategies may also be necessary to achieve appropriate levels of therapy for all targeted outcomes . until completion of further studies, it is recommended that dosing be tailored to the clinical response of the individual patient to treatment.

no adverse effects were noted in any animals receiving either oral or iv treatments of meloxicam. to further evaluate the safety of meloxicam administration in healthy llamas, complete blood count and chemistry panels were submitted on all animals prior to and following the second phase of treatment. we were particularly concerned with the effect of treatment on liver and kidney chemistry values, as renal and hepatic toxicity are known complications of nsaid use  <cit> . as reported in table  <dig>  all animals consistently displayed a mild hypoalbuminemia and decreased bun prior to treatment, while five of the six displayed a mild anemia in comparison to the references ranges. these abnormalities may be related to the use of standard reference ranges from oregon state university diagnostic laboratory instead of validation of in-house reference ranges, as differences in instrumentation can lead to variability in results. decreased bun and albumin can also be related to feeding of a low protein diet  <cit> . the level of bun did increase in a statistically significant manner after treatment with meloxicam, however, the average value was still considered to be lower than the reference range. as these animals were housed at their home farm in between treatment phases, the potential exists for differences in fed protein levels between home farm  and university  feed sources. mild anemia and hypoalbuminemia can also be related to intestinal parasitism, which is common in camelids. fecal samples were taken from  <dig> of the  <dig> animals with the lowest hematocrit for mcmaster’s quantitative fecal egg counts;  <dig> of the  <dig> were negative for parasite detection, while the other  <dig> exhibited only very low levels  of intestinal parasites. this alone is cannot completely rule out current intestinal parasitism as the cause of the mild anemia and hypoproteinemia; in addition, the history of anti-parasiticide administration is unknown in these animals. therefore, recent on-farm deworming may have affected the results of the fecal exams. the low serum albumin exhibited by the animals in this study also has the potential to affect the pharmacokinetic data of meloxicam as nsaids are typically highly bound to plasma proteins  <cit> ; however, there is no evidence available to demonstrate that it impacted the results presented in this study.

one animal exhibited a significantly elevated ast level pre-treatment that had decreased slightly by the post-treatment sample but was still elevated; this animal was otherwise apparently healthy for the entire duration of the study. all other animals had normal ast values pre-treatment; in  <dig> of the  <dig> remaining animals, ast levels were increased above pre-treatment levels in post-treatment samples, however, only  <dig> additional animal exhibited ast levels greater than the reference range post-treatment. the difference in ast between pre- and post-treatment blood samples was not considered to be statistically significant. one animal exhibited elevated ggt following treatment, but overall change in ggt for all animals was not statistically significant. statistically significant increases were seen in chloride, while statistically significant decreases were noted with bicarbonate, non-esterified fatty acids  and creatinine. however, all values for these parameters were still within normal references ranges and thus the differences are not considered to be biologically significant. further studies involving multiple dosages and increased duration of therapy would be warranted to verify that there are no negative effects on either kidney or liver function with prolonged therapy.

in addition to risk of nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, nsaid usage has been commonly recognized as a risk factor for gastric ulceration in many species, including humans, cats, dogs and horses, and it has been suggested as a potential risk factor for ulceration of the third compartment of the camelid stomach   <cit> . in llamas, c <dig> ulcers are a commonly encountered gastrointestinal disorder, however, there is a lack of scientific data detailing the pathogenesis of ulcer formation in this species  <cit> . it has been suggested that stress, especially related to disease and chronic disorders or isolation from herd mates, may play a role in the development of ulcerations in llamas  <cit> . non-selective nsaids decrease the production of prostaglandins thought to be important in maintaining mucosal blood flow and mucous secretion in mammals; it is a combination of this and other effects that is thought to lead to gastric ulceration with nsaid use  <cit> . previous studies involving daily intramuscular administration of  <dig>  mg/kg flunixin meglumine have demonstrated a lack of statistically significant gastric ph reduction and ulcer formation in llamas, which led the authors of that study to suggest that nsaids may not exert similar ulcerogenic effects in this species  <cit> . however, recent literature reviews on nsaid-induced gastropathy do not suggest direct reduction of ph as an inciting cause of ulceration  <cit> . thus, with a lack of strong scientific data to suggest that nsaids do not exert an ulcerogenic effect in llamas, it may be prudent to utilize nsaids such as meloxicam that have exhibited improved gi safety profiles in other species  <cit> .

although reports vary, extensive work in humans suggests that while not completely free from gi-related side effects, there is a greater gi safety profile for cox- <dig> selective inhibitors in comparison to non-selective inhibitors  <cit> . meloxicam is generally considered to be a cox- <dig> selective drug; however, studies have shown that there can be much variability between species in the preference of inhibition of cyclooxygenase- <dig> versus cyclooxygenase- <dig> for a given drug. in humans, meloxicam demonstrates a significant and long lasting preference for inhibition of cox- <dig> while having much less activity against cox- <dig>  <cit> . in dogs, in vitro assays suggest that meloxicam ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> times more effective at inhibiting cox- <dig> versus cox- <dig>  <cit> . however, in cats, both in vitro and ex vivo studies have shown a ratio of only  <dig>  in regards to selectivity of cox- <dig> inhibition over cox- <dig>  <cit> . early meloxicam research in horses also suggests that even though present, suppression of cox- <dig> is reversible, and cox- <dig> inhibition is prolonged at sites of inflammation  <cit> . therefore, meloxicam may offer some selective benefit in llamas of cox- <dig> inhibition over the non-selective nsaids, but further studies are warranted to determine to what extent it can be considered cox- <dig> selective in this species.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study suggest that oral administration of meloxicam may offer a practical and long-acting option for nsaid administration for the relief of pain and inflammation in llamas. the pharmacokinetic profile described in this study supports further research including pharmacodynamic studies and efficacy trials to best determine appropriate dosage and treatment intervals for certain disorders. additional studies evaluating response to multi-day therapy regimens are also warranted to fully assess the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of this cox- <dig> selective nsaid in llamas.
