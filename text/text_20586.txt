BACKGROUND
the prediction of protein subcellular localization  focuses on determining localization sites of unknown proteins in a cell. the study of psl is important for elucidating protein functions involved in various cellular processes. despite recent technical advances, experimental determination of psl remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. in addition, researches in the post-genomic era have yielded a tremendous amount of sequence data. given the size and complexity of the data, many researchers would prefer to use prediction systems to identify and screen possible candidates for further analyses. hence, computational approaches have become increasingly important.

previous works
extensive studies of psl prediction have led to the development of several methods, which can be classified as follows.

 <dig>  amino acid composition-based methods these methods utilize machine learning techniques, including neural networks  <cit>  and support vector machines   <cit> . this category includes methods like p-classifier  <cit>  and cello  <cit> , which utilize n-peptide composition-based svm approaches.

 <dig>  methods that integrate various protein characteristics several methods including expert systems  <cit> , k-nearest neighbor  <cit> , svm  <cit> , support vector data description  <cit> , and bayesian networks  <cit> , integrate various biological features that influence localization. the features that characterize a protein can be extracted from biological literature, public databases, and related prediction systems. both psortb  <cit>  and pslpred  <cit>  integrate different analytical modules and demonstrate that the hybrid approaches perform better than each individual module.

 <dig>  sequence homology-based methods it has been suggested that psl is an evolutionary conserved trait  <cit> . efforts to address the relationship between evolutionary information and localization identity have relied heavily on exploiting sequence similarity to infer psl. such methods include phylogenetic profiling  <cit> , domain projection  <cit> , and a sequence homology-based method  <cit> . several other methods, such as psortb and pslpred, also incorporate such sequence homology-based components in their analyses.

our contributions
the prediction of psl presents several challenges. first, the performance of amino acid composition-based and sequence homology-based methods might be significantly degraded if homologous sequences are not detected. second, the results of these two methods are generally difficult to interpret; therefore, it is difficult to determine which biological features should be used to identify specific psl and why they work well for prediction. if the features were biologically interpretable, the resultant knowledge could help in designing artificial proteins with the desired properties. meanwhile, methods that integrate various features could suffer from the problem of low coverage in high-throughput proteomic analyses due to the lack of information to characterize unknown proteins. finally, many psl methods are implemented on redundant training sets, which might lead to overestimation of the predictive performance. thus, the performance would be significantly lower if redundant sequences were meticulously removed.

in this study, we propose a hybrid method that combines a one-versus-one  svm model referred to as psl <dig>  and a structural homology approach called pslsse  to predict the psl for gram-negative bacteria. psl <dig> comprises a number of binary classifiers, where compartment-specific biological features derived from gram-negative bacteria translocation pathways are incorporated. in pslsse, we employ secondary structure alignment for structural similarity comparison and assign the known localization of the top-ranked protein as the predicted localization of a query protein. experiment results show that psl <dig> achieves high prediction accuracy, which demonstrates that biological features derived from gram-negative bacteria translocation pathways significantly enhance the performance. moreover, since the selected features are biologically interpretable, they can be easily applied to advanced analyses and experimental designs. most notably, the overall accuracy of combining psl <dig> and pslsse is further improved to  <dig> %, which is a  <dig> % improvement over the second best method. our analysis suggests that, in addition to sequence homology, structural homology can also be an effective indicator for inferring psl. lastly, since sequence redundancy in the training data often leads to overestimation of prediction accuracy, we present an evaluation using non-redundant data sets. it is also known that cross-validation may overestimate the predictive performance when parameters are optimized repeatedly on the same test data. therefore, we adopt a three-way data split procedure for evaluating the non-redundant data sets. the results suggest that these techniques can prevent overestimation of the performance such that the general performance of psl prediction should be approximately 85%. in the assessment of the evaluation data sets, our hybrid method also provides accurate prediction, especially for those sequences of low homology to the training set.

RESULTS
data sets
to assess our method, we utilize several data sets of gram-negative bacteria proteins that have been used in previous works  <cit> . gram-negative bacteria have five major psl sites: the cytoplasm , inner membrane , periplasm , outer membrane , and extracellular space . table  <dig> lists the number of proteins in different localization sites in the data sets, which are detailed in table 1s of the supplementary material .

 <dig>  benchmark data sets: derived from the first release of epsortdb  <cit> , the first data set, referred to as ps <dig>  consists of proteins with experimentally determined localizations. the second data set, ps <dig>  is an expanded version of ps <dig> 

 <dig>  non-redundant data sets: to assess the predictive performance of non-homologous proteins, we utilize cd-hit  <cit> , a redundancy filtering program, to eliminate sequences that share greater or equal to 30% sequence identity in the ps <dig> and ps <dig> data sets, which yields the nr <dig> and nr <dig> data sets, respectively.

 <dig>  evaluation data sets: recently, a new data set  <cit>  comprised of  <dig> proteins was created for comparison of different methods. we first apply clustalw  <cit>  to divide the new set into two subsets according to the sequence identity of each protein pair between the  <dig> proteins and proteins in the known training sets  with a cutoff of 30%. then, redundant sequences are removed from each subset by cd-hit with a 30% threshold; the resultant non-redundant data sets are called ev90_high  and ev153_low . the combination of both sets is referred to as the ev243_all data set.

effect of biological features derived from gram-negative bacteria translocation pathways
since it is impractical to try all possible feature combinations in different classifiers, heuristics guided by biological insights are used to determine a small subset of feature sets specific to each classifier. starting with an empty subset, a sequential forward search algorithm  <cit>  keeps adding the best feature sets that improve the accuracy. the process terminates when adding a feature set no longer makes any improvement. the performance of psl <dig> evaluated by ten-fold cross-validation for the benchmark data sets is shown in the leftmost column of table  <dig>  psl <dig> attains overall accuracy of  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the ps <dig> and ps <dig> data sets, respectively. most notably, cp and im proteins attain accurate prediction performance in terms of both accuracy and mcc, which can be explained by the fact that proteins localized in cp and im are characterized by several well-known biological features in our method.

ยง the performance of incorporating a three-way data split procedure is indicated in the parentheses.

the features selected from psl <dig> for the ps <dig> data set using cross-validation are shown in figure 1; the same set of features is used in the corresponding training and testing scheme for the ps <dig> data set. the experiment results demonstrate that our feature selection not only yields a significant improvement in the performance, but also correlates well with biological insights. for example, in figure  <dig>  psl <dig> selects signal peptides, transmembrane a-helices, and relevant solvent accessibility  as the optimal features to distinguish cp and im proteins. in addition, di-peptide composition, signal peptides, and transmembrane ฮฒ-barrels  are used in the discrimination of cp and om proteins. the combination of general and compartment-specific features works well in differentiating between any two compartments in each classifier; accordingly, the overall accuracy of the combined predictions of each classifier is improved. the results support our assumption that compartment-specific biological features derived from gram-negative bacteria translocation pathways can significantly enhance the performance of psl prediction. moreover, the selected features are biologically interpretable and can be easily applied in further analyses.

effect of sequence and structure conservation
we now explore the relationship between sequence and structural similarity and localization identity. both sequence and structural homology approaches, referred to as pslseq and pslsse, are developed to infer localization based on sequence alignment using clustalw and secondary structure alignment using ssea  <cit> , respectively. figure  <dig> shows that when the structural similarity is greater or equal to 80%, pslsse performs slightly better than psl101; otherwise, psl <dig> is significantly better. thus, we propose a hybrid approach that combines pslsse and psl <dig>  called pslsse+psl <dig>  for each query protein, if the top-rank aligned protein shares an 80% or greater structural similarity with any of the proteins in the training set, the localization is predicted by pslsse; otherwise, it is predicted by psl <dig>  in addition, we implement another hybrid approach, called pslseq+psl <dig>  which uses a cutoff of 30% sequence identity  <cit>  to combine pslseq and psl <dig> 

performance comparison of n-fold cross validation and three-way data split
the performance of the three-way data split experiments is shown in parentheses in table  <dig>  the features selected from psl <dig> for the ps <dig> data set using three-way data split are shown in figure 1s in the supplementary material ; the same set of features is used in the corresponding training and testing scheme for the ps <dig> data set. the overall accuracy of psl <dig>  pslseq+psl <dig>  and pslsse+psl <dig> drop  <dig> %~ <dig> % for both the ps <dig> and ps <dig> data sets. specifically, the accuracy and mcc of the same localization sites are consistent across the two different data sets. moreover, the performance of the two data sets evaluated using three-way data split is more consistent than that assessed by ten-fold cross-validation. this suggests that a three-way data split procedure could avoid overestimation of the predictive performance; therefore, it should be considered in psl prediction.

comparison with other approaches using the benchmark data sets
ยง the best performance of overall and individual localization sites is underlined.

comparison with other approaches using the evaluation data sets
the evaluation data sets were submitted to the web servers of each prediction method. the predictive performance is shown in table  <dig>  cello ii and p-classifier achieve consistent overall accuracy in the range of  <dig> %~ <dig> % for the ev90_high and ev153_low data sets. pslpred attains overall accuracy of  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the ev153_low and ev90_high sets, respectively. psortb v. <dig>  performs very well for the ev90_high set, but poorly for the ev153_low set. hybrid yields the best predictions for proteins of low sequence similarity and ranks second best for highly homologous sequences. this demonstrates that when no homologous sequences are detected, biological features derived from gram-negative bacteria translocation pathways yield accurate prediction; on the other hand, the incorporation of structural homology approach further improves the predictive performance for highly homologous sequences. when both data sets are evaluated on the ev243_all set, hybrid achieves an overall accuracy of  <dig> %, which is a  <dig> % improvement over the second best method. this suggests that hybrid could enhance the robustness of psl prediction, especially when highly homologous sequences are not detected.

ยง the best performance of overall and individual localization sites is underlined. hybrid is trained on the ps <dig> data set.

performance of non-redundant data sets
in both benchmark data sets, proteins sharing up to 30% sequence identity comprise approximately 42% of the sets. one drawback of a high level of redundancy in data sets is that it could lead to poor generalization for a predictor, since the predictor might fail to assign a correct psl, especially for those sequences of low homology to the training set. for this reason, the construction of non-redundant data sets is necessary when evaluating the performance of psl prediction.

here, we present performance assessments using non-redundant sequences from gram-negative bacteria data sets. using the same features derived from the ps <dig> set by cross-validation, we use hybrid to train and evaluate the two non-redundant sets via ten-fold cross-validation. the performance is shown in table  <dig>  the overall accuracy declines markedly by approximately 8% using the non-redundant sets compared with those using the redundant sets. the mcc for individual localization sites also drops by  <dig> ~ <dig> . these results indicate that the general performance of psl prediction for gram-negative bacteria is approximately 85% for non-redundant data sets. methods that are less dependent on homology detection should be developed if highly homologous sequences are removed completely.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we have proposed a hybrid method for predicting psl for gram-negative bacteria based on a combination of a 1-v- <dig> svm model using compartment-specific biological features and a structural homology approach using secondary structure alignment. experiment results show that the svm model achieves high prediction accuracy for both benchmark data sets, thus supporting the assumption that biological features derived from gram-negative bacteria translocation pathways could significantly improve the performance. the overall accuracy of combining the svm model and the structural homology approach is further improved, which indicates that structural homology, like sequence homology, could also be a useful indicator for inferring psl. a three-way data split procedure is incorporated to prevent overfitting of the parameters and features. in addition, non-redundant data sets have been used for the evaluation of gram-negative bacteria. the results suggest that the performance could be overestimated if redundant sequences are considered. in the assessment of the evaluation data sets, our hybrid method provides accurate predictions, especially when sequences of low sequence similarity to the training data are detected. the proposed method can be used in large-scale analyses of proteomes and is freely available for public use at  <cit> .

there are still some challenges to be addressed in psl prediction. in our work, we only consider proteins with single localization sites. however, proteins with multiple localization sites are not a rarity, especially in higher order species  <cit> . in our future development, we will consider those proteins localized to multiple compartments. in addition, better accuracy and coverage are needed, particularly for several poorly predicted localization sites. we will also extend our method to combine more biological features, analyze multiple compartment proteins, and incorporate proteins of more species, including those of humans.
