BACKGROUND
hfq proteins primarily function as chaperones in the bacterial cell, facilitating the interaction between small rnas  and their target mrnas to regulate gene expression  <cit> . hfq has also been implicated in the direct modulation of the expression of certain mrnas  <cit> . hfq proteins are members of the sm and sm-like rna-binding family and generally form hexameric rings that bind rnas on the distal and proximal faces, as well as on a charged rim patch on the outer edge of the ring .

the role and impact of hfq proteins has been well characterized in gram-negative bacteria, with hfq deletion strains exhibiting severe growth defects, increased susceptibility to a range of environmental stresses, and decreased virulence  <cit> . in e. coli, hfq overexpression negatively impacts cell physiology by decreasing ftsz expression, inhibiting proper cell division  <cit> .

conversely, the role of hfq and its associated srna regulation has not been fully or clearly elucidated in gram-positive bacteria, despite the expression of numerous srnas in these species. for example, deletion of hfq from staphylococcus aureus has no major effects on physiology, and srna regulation is not impacted  <cit> . similarly, while bacillus subtilis hfq associates with numerous srnas in vivo  <cit> , Δhfq b. subtilis strains exhibit only subtle effects on their physiology and transcriptome  <cit> . in contrast, in listeria monocytogenes, hfq plays a direct role in modulating stress tolerance and virulence  <cit>  and interacts effectively with specific srnas  <cit> . a recent study in clostridium difficile identified multiple phenotypes associated with the knockdown of hfq expression, including the first evidence of an hfq-dependent growth phenotype in a gram-positive species  <cit> .

unlike most bacteria, bacillus anthracis, the etiological agent of anthrax, possesses multiple copies of hfq within its genome. two copies are located on the b. anthracis chromosome , and the third  is encoded by the pxo <dig> virulence plasmid, which also produces the bacterium’s toxin components. hfq <dig> is closest in protein sequence to the single copy of hfq in the close relative b. subtilis, whereas hfq <dig> and hfq <dig> are divergent in sequence from b. subtilis hfq . each of the three hfq genes is expressed at the mrna level during the mid-log phase of growth  <cit> .fig.  <dig> sequence alignment of hfq proteins. alignment of e. coli hfq, s. aureus hfq, b. subtilis hfq, and b. anthracis hfq <dig>  hfq <dig> and hfq <dig> protein sequences using clustal omega  <cit> . boxshade was used to create the image; black shading indicates identical residues, and grey shading denotes biochemically similar residues. the location of the sm <dig> rna binding motif is labeled




our recent work  <cit>  and that of panda et al.  <cit>  expanded the understanding of hfq structure and function within the bacillus genus by characterization of the structure and function of recombinant b. anthracis hfq proteins. hfq <dig>  does not form the typical hexameric structure expected for the protein family; instead, it behaves as a monomer that appears to disrupt e. coli hfq’s chaperone activity with a dominant negative phenotype  <cit> . in contrast, hfq <dig>  forms the standard hexamer  <cit> . purified hfq <dig>  behaves as a mixture of hexamer and monomer, and his-hfq <dig> partially complements the e. coli Δhfq phenotype  <cit> . panda et al.  <cit>  reported binding of rnas to both hfq <dig> and hfq <dig>  in vitro; however, analysis of hfq <dig> binding was limited to a mixed pool of labeled cellular rnas, and no specific rna-hfq <dig> binding pairs were identified.

in this study, we examine the effects of overexpressing hfq <dig> in bacillus anthracis, as a means of identifying potential hfq3-regulated pathways. we selected hfq <dig> for further analysis due to its sequence divergence from other bacillus hfq proteins, as well as its ability to form hexamers and its presence on one of b. anthracis’ virulence plasmids. we observed a severe growth defect associated with the overexpression of hfq <dig> in b. anthracis, but not in b. subtilis. based on mutational analysis, we determined that this phenotype is dependent on residues on the distal face of hfq <dig> that are associated with mrna binding in other species. overall, we report a novel phenotype associated with hfq overexpression in a gram-positive species, contributing to our current understanding of structure-function relationships of hfq proteins in gram-positive bacteria.

methods
bacterial strains, media, and growth conditions
all bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers used in this study are listed in additional file 1: tables s2–s <dig>  top <dig>  dh5-α, and scs <dig> e. coli strains were used for cloning. b. anthracis strain ames  <dig>  and b. subtilis strain py <dig>  <cit>  were grown in lb broth/plate or nby broth/plate . lb and nby/ <dig> % sodium bicarbonate cultures were incubated at 37 °c in air or a co <dig> environment, respectively. e. coli hfq in vivo complementation strains  were grown on macconkey agar plates  incubated at 37 °c in air. when appropriate, antibiotics were added to both liquid and solid media: ampicillin ; kanamycin .

cloning and transformation
each hfq gene was cloned into the psw <dig> shuttle expression vector  <cit>  using the ndei and bamhi restriction sites. after passage through scs <dig> to prepare unmethylated dna, psw <dig> vectors were transformed into b. anthracis via electroporation. psw <dig> expression vectors were transformed into b. subtilis strain py <dig> via natural competency using modified competency media   <cit> .

total lysate and western blot analysis
bacteria were grown in lb or nby/ <dig> % sodium bicarbonate cultures in either air  or 15% co <dig> . cells were harvested via centrifugation, and cell pellets were lysed in 1x pbs via beadbeating. protein concentrations of lysate supernates were estimated via an a <dig> measurement, and gels/blots were normalized by loading equal amounts of total protein per well, which was validated by coomassie blue staining. proteins were separated on 4–20% tris-glycine gels  or 16% tricine gels . samples were run as semi-native  vs. boiled , and were prepared with either 2x tris-glycine sds loading buffer  or 2x tricine sds loading buffer . both gel systems utilized running buffer containing  <dig> % sds. following sds-page, 16% tricine gels were coomassie blue stained, and 4–20% tris-glycine gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. membranes were blocked with odyssey blocking buffer  and probed with anti-hfq <dig> antibodies  overnight at room temperature. an anti-mouse ir800-conjugated secondary antibody  was utilized for detection, and blots were visualized on the odyssey li-cor infrared scanner.

site-directed mutagenesis
point mutations were introduced into hfq <dig> in the psw <dig> and pqe <dig> vectors by the q <dig> site-directed mutagenesis kit  using the primers listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  as well as the primers in  <cit>  for the q4a mutation in pqe <dig>  each mutant gene was fully sequenced in the coding region.

microscopy
samples for transmission electron microscopy  and differential interference contrast microscopy  were prepared from lb plate scrapings. for tem, cells were washed with pbs and resuspended in a 2% paraformaldehyde and  <dig>  m sodium cacodylate fixative. images were collected using a hitachi h- <dig> transmission electron microscope. for dic imaging, a leica tcs sp <dig> confocal microscope dmi  <dig>  was used to collect the images with a 63x oil immersion objective na  <dig> . images were post-processed using imaris image processing software  and adobe photoshop  <dig>  .

complementation in e. coli
pqe <dig> his-hfq <dig> expression plasmids  were transformed into a ΔlaczΔhfq strain of e. coli carrying an rpos-lacz translational fusion . resulting strains were streaked to macconkey  agar plates  and incubated for ≈ 16 h at 37 °c to observe color development. lactose in the macconkey plates induces constitutive expression of his-hfqs from the plasmids. β-galactosidase assays were conducted on overnight macconkey plate scrapings essentially as described in reference  <cit> . to observe total hfq protein expression levels, cells were scraped from macconkey plates and lysed with an 8 m urea buffer . lysates were visualized on 16% tricine gels by coomassie blue staining.

we observed that deletion of the his-tag from the wild-type hfq <dig> construct reduced the pink color on macconkey plates; this may be due to reduction in protein accumulation in the absence of the tag, impacts on other properties of heterologous expression, and/or impacts of the tag on the biochemistry of the protein itself. therefore, the original his-hfq <dig> system for heterologous production in e. coli was retained. .

antibiotic sensitivity and cell autolysis assays
minimum inhibitory concentration  testing was performed based on the protocol described in reference  <cit> , with modifications indicated below. lb plate scrapings of individual colonies of hfq <dig> or gfp overexpression strains were diluted in lb-kanamycin . vancomycin and ampicillin were serially diluted in lb-kanamycin across a 96-well plate with final concentrations ranging from 32– <dig>  μg/ml  and from 32– <dig>  μg/ml . hfq <dig> and gfp overexpression strains were inoculated to a final cfu count of  <dig> – <dig>  × 104/well. plates were incubated at 37 °c with shaking at 200 rpm for 19 h, and then visually observed for the presence of turbidity to determine mics. mics in additional file 1: table s <dig> represent results for  <dig> gfp overexpression strain colonies and  <dig> hfq <dig> overexpression strain colonies aggregated across at least three independent experiments.

to monitor cell autolysis, lb plate scrapings of hfq <dig> or gfp overexpression strains were resuspended to an od <dig> of  <dig> – <dig>  in lb-kanamycin . due to the small colony size of the hfq <dig> strain, replicates for both strains were created from multiple colonies. cultures were incubated at 37 °c with shaking at 225 rpm for 30 min to resume active growth, followed by addition of triton x- <dig> to a final concentration of  <dig> %  and continued incubation at 37 °c.

animal studies
female balb/cj mice  were purchased from jackson laboratories . all animal studies were performed in accordance with national institutes of health and animal welfare act guidelines on protocol lpd8e, approved by the animal care and use committee of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, national institutes of health.

mouse antibodies
to generate mouse polyclonal antibodies against hfq <dig>  balb/cj mice were immunized - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and -4 weeks prior to terminal serum bleeds. immunizations were performed subcutaneously with 10–30 μg of purified his-hfq <dig>  aluminum hydroxide gel  was used as adjuvant and premixed with antigen at 1: <dig> . antibody reactivity and specificity were assessed by western blotting  and by dilution elisa. the anti-hfq <dig> antibody was specific for purified hfq <dig> . the antibody was able to detect overexpressed hfq <dig> in b. anthracis cell lysates, but not endogenous levels of hfq <dig> in b. anthracis lysates . we previously demonstrated that hfq <dig> is expressed at the rna level in log-phase b. anthracis  <cit> . based on western blotting profiles, it is likely that this antibody recognizes a conformational epitope, resulting in better recognition of hfq <dig> hexamer vs. hfq <dig> monomer. the in vivo structure of overexpressed hfq <dig> as observed by western blot  is consistent with our previous in vitro work with purified his-hfq <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
an hfq <dig> overexpression system as an investigational tool
our previous work compared the biochemical properties of the three hfq proteins of b. anthracis. while the sm <dig> rna-binding motif is well conserved in hfq <dig>  the unstructured c-terminus present in e. coli hfq is significantly truncated . in searching for physiological roles of these proteins, we did not observe defects in the growth rates of hfq deletion strains, including a Δhfq1hfq2hfq <dig> strain  <cit> , consistent with previous findings in b. subtilis  <cit> . this led us to investigate phenotypes linked to overexpression of hfq proteins in b. anthracis as an alternative means of identifying roles of this protein family in bacilli. intentional overexpression is a useful genetic tool for the identification of cellular pathways linked to a gene of interest in wild-type cells, and can identify phenotypes that are not evident from deletion analysis in some cases  <cit> .

to generate an overexpression system, we prepared a series of psw <dig> vectors in which each hfq gene is under the control of a version of the b. anthracis protective antigen promoter. expression from psw <dig> is induced by transition of cells from air/lb media to co2/bicarbonate-containing media . upon transformation of each hfq overexpression vector into b. anthracis, a striking difference was noted in the colony morphology of the hfq <dig> overexpression strain as compared to the hfq <dig> overexpression strain, as well as to a gfp overexpression strain serving as a control . hfq <dig> expression-induced toxicity was observed in our earlier work in e. coli when his-hfq <dig> was expressed from a t <dig> promoter. in that case, his-hfq <dig> was predominantly located in insoluble inclusion bodies  <cit> . when overexpressed in b. anthracis via psw <dig>  hfq <dig> is present in the soluble fraction , suggesting a toxic effect of soluble hfq <dig> in b. anthracis.fig.  <dig> characterization of hfq <dig> overexpression toxicity. a anomalous colony morphology of hfq <dig> overexpression strain transformants as compared to hfq <dig> and gfp overexpression strain transformants . cropped images reflect the same plate area in each case; scale bar 10 mm. b western blot depicting level of hfq <dig> whole cell expression vs. soluble expression level  in an overnight culture grown under inducing conditions. “total” sample was prepared by lysing cells in 8 m urea, as compared to “soluble” sample, which was prepared by lysing cells by beadbeating in 1x pbs. equal amounts of total cellular protein were loaded in each well, as verified by a parallel protein gel. dotted arrow indicates the 50 kda marker band. c growth of b. anthracis strains patched to lb incubated at 37 °c in air or to nby/bicarbonate incubated at 37 °c in 15% co <dig>  as indicated.  ames  <dig> parent strain,  hfq <dig> overexpression strain,  hfq <dig> overexpression strain, and  gfp overexpression strain. d expression of hfq <dig> in the absence  and presence  of inducing conditions. equal amounts of total soluble protein from cell lysates were subjected to sds-page and western blotting with anti-hfq <dig>  samples were analyzed under semi-native  and boiled  conditions. due to the growth phenotype, log-phase od <dig> values for hfq <dig> are difficult to attain, so hfq <dig> levels depicted here for both lb and nby are derived from a 10 ml culture grown to an od <dig> of  <dig> – <dig> . dotted arrow represents the 50 kda marker band. e total cell lysate gel comparing overexpression levels of hfq <dig>  hfq <dig>  and gfp in b. anthracis grown under inducing conditions to an od <dig> of  <dig> – <dig> ; the hfq <dig> strain was prepared as described above in panel . equal amounts of total soluble protein were subjected to sds-page. samples were analyzed under semi-native  and boiled  conditions. dotted arrow represents the 55 kda marker band, solid arrow represents the 7 kda marker band, and asterisks denote approximate locations of hfq <dig>  hfq <dig>  and gfp protein bands




characterization of the hfq <dig> toxic growth phenotype in b. anthracis
to further characterize the impact of hfq <dig> overexpression on b. anthracis, we directly compared the growth of ames  <dig> , ames  <dig> overexpressing hfq <dig>  ames  <dig> overexpressing hfq <dig>  and ames  <dig> expressing an unrelated protein . these plates recapitulated the negative impact of hfq <dig> overexpression both at 15% co <dig>  and at 5% co <dig> . overexpressed hfq <dig> has a toxic phenotype in air  that is variable . this can be ascribed to leaky expression from the psw <dig> vector, since hfq <dig> expression was observed under both non-inducing and inducing conditions, with an increase in hfq <dig> production upon induction . under inducing conditions, the overexpressed hfq <dig> accumulates to lower levels than overexpressed hfq <dig>  relative to total cellular protein, as is visible in fig. 2e. the gfp variant protein is expressed more abundantly than either of the hfqs , indicating that overexpression of proteins in general does not impair growth in b. anthracis.

while hfq <dig> overexpression did not reproducibly inhibit growth on the plate patches , about 50% of the ames  <dig> psw4-hfq <dig> transformants across  <dig> individual colonies and  <dig> experiments exhibited toxicity under inducing conditions . in parallel experiments, >95% of independent psw4-hfq <dig> transformants exhibited growth defects. this defect is evident after 24 h of growth at 30 °c for the hfq <dig> overexpression strain . however, we did not observe any evidence on the plates of psw4-hfq <dig> toxicity under non-inducing conditions . therefore, we propose that overexpression of hfq <dig> in b. anthracis has a toxic effect once cellular protein levels reach higher concentrations than for hfq <dig>  which appears to be toxic to the cells even at low, leaky levels of expression. additionally, we hypothesize that variability in hfq <dig> toxicity is due to variations in protein expression levels across independent transformants.

a corresponding growth defect in liquid was observed for the hfq <dig> overexpression strain . hfq <dig> overexpression cultures eventually reached near wild-type od <dig> values after 24 h of growth . plating of the 24-h cultures on lb-kanamycin vs. lb demonstrated retention of antibiotic resistance, suggesting that recovery of normal growth was not due to plasmid loss. “recovered” hfq3-overexpressing colonies  exhibited a normal growth phenotype from the start of growth . hfq <dig> expression levels of these colonies were reduced relative to total cellular protein , suggesting that the recovered phenotype is a consequence of reduced hfq <dig> expression levels due to a suppressor mutation within hfq <dig> or other regions of the plasmid. plasmids were prepared from eight “recovered” colonies, and the hfq <dig> inserts were sequenced. seven of the eight clones sequenced successfully; two of these carried a nonsense mutation in residue q <dig> of hfq <dig>  and the other five did not carry any mutations in the hfq <dig> reading frame or in the upstream promoter region, nor did the plasmid visibly differ in size on an agarose gel . these clones may carry mutations in other regions of the plasmid that result in copy number changes, for example. due to the rapid accumulation of suppressor mutations in liquid cultures, we have focused on plate-based growth assays in this paper. we note, however, that we cannot rule out the possibility that hfq <dig> overexpressing transformants already have accumulated some level of suppressor mutations upon their initial appearance on the plate.fig.  <dig> characterization of hfq3-associated toxicity in liquid media. growth curves were performed at 37 °c, 225 rpm, and 15% co <dig> in nby/bicarbonate media. a growth comparison of ames  <dig> wt  and ames 35-hfq <dig> overexpression strain . data is expressed as the mean of three biological replicates for each strain +/- the standard error of the mean . b growth comparison of recovered colonies #1– <dig> to the parent hfq <dig> overexpression strain. error bars reflect standard error of the mean  of three biological replicates for the parent hfq <dig> strain. the doubling time during log phase averaged across the six recovered colonies was 41 ± 1 min. and the doubling time over this time course for the ames- <dig> hfq <dig> cells was ≈ 90+ min. in contrast, the doubling time for wild-type ames  <dig> grown under these conditions  in parallel experiments is ≈ 33–35 min. c expression levels of hfq <dig> from recovered colonies as compared to the parent hfq <dig> overexpression strain. equal amounts of total soluble protein from cell lysates  were subjected to sds-page and western blotting with anti-hfq <dig>  samples were analyzed under semi-native  and boiled  conditions. dotted arrow represents the 50 kda marker band. based on imagej analysis, hfq <dig> expression levels were reduced between  <dig> and 17-fold as compared to the hfq <dig> overexpression parent strain in recovered isolates with detectable protein expression. no protein expression was detectable in isolates carrying the nonsense mutations described in results. d growth of ames  <dig> Δhfq1hfq2hfq <dig> and ames  <dig> Δhfq1hfq2hfq <dig> overexpressing hfq <dig> patched to lb incubated at 37 °c in air or to nby/bicarbonate incubated at 37 °c in 15% co <dig>  as indicated. as described in results, the severity of the phenotype of hfq3-overexpressing strains in air is variable across independent experiments




distal face residues are required for hfq <dig> toxicity
one potential etiology of the hfq <dig> overexpression phenotype could be the interaction of overexpressed hfq <dig> with endogenous hfq proteins. however, an ames  <dig> Δhfq1hfq2hfq3-hfq <dig> overexpression strain retains the toxic phenotype .

alternatively, the observed toxicity could be due to increased hfq <dig> binding to specific rnas. to investigate this possibility, we created a set of hfq <dig> mutants  designed to disrupt residues predicted to be necessary for different hfq-rna binding faces based on mutagenesis studies from other bacterial species . note that figures are labeled with b. anthracis hfq <dig> residue numbers; however, the analogous e. coli and s. aureus residues are listed in table  <dig> for comparison with the hfq mutant literature. hfq has been demonstrated to bind rnas via its proximal and distal faces, as well as its rim region . in e. coli, mutation of residues q <dig> or k <dig> on the proximal face resulted in a severe reduction of hfq activity, due to disruption of srna binding  <cit> . effects of mutation of proximal face residue d <dig> on e. coli hfq function were mixed , and the d <dig> residue is linked to a role in the selectivity of srna binding, thus facilitating proper annealing  <cit> . mutation of e. coli residues y <dig>  i <dig>  or k <dig> on the distal face had variable effects on hfq activity, ranging from nearly fully functional  to completely nonfunctional , due to disruption of interactions with mrna  <cit> . finally, an arginine patch located on the rim of hfq has been implicated in mediation of mrna:srna interactions  <cit> ; when the patch is mutated in e. coli, hfq experiences a partial to complete loss of function, depending on the characteristics of the specific srnas and mrnas being assayed  <cit> .table  <dig>

the locations of mutants created by site-directed mutagenesis in b. anthracis hfq <dig>  are depicted on the proximal  and distal  faces of the e. coli hfq structure. proximal face residues q <dig>  e <dig>  d <dig>  and k <dig>  as well as distal face residue r <dig>  were mutated to alanine, and distal face residues f <dig> and v <dig> were mutated to aspartic acid . we refer to the e5a/d6a mutant as the “ed patch” mutant  <cit> . in hfq <dig>  the rim arginine patch is not present; the e. coli patch ‘rrer’ is replaced by ‘ieeq’. thus, we created a “rim revertant” construct in which the hfq <dig> ‘ie’ sequence was mutated to the e. coli hfq ‘rr’ identity.fig.  <dig> mutational analysis of hfq <dig>  a, b jmol-generated images of the proximal and distal faces of e. coli hfq  with mutated residues highlighted and numbered using b. anthracis hfq <dig> nomenclature. c growth comparison of each hfq <dig> mutant patched to lb incubated at 37 °c in air  or to nby/bicarbonate incubated at 37 °c in 15% co <dig> . mutations are noted as “p” for proximal, “d” for distal, or “r” for rim along the edges of the plate. d expression of each hfq <dig> mutant grown under inducing conditions to an od <dig> of  <dig> – <dig> . note that the hfq <dig> control was prepared as described in fig. 2d. equal amounts of total soluble protein from cell lysates were subjected to sds-page and western blotting with anti-hfq <dig>  samples were analyzed under semi-native  and boiled  conditions. dotted arrows represent the 50 kda marker band




the impact of each mutation on the growth of hfq3-overexpressing ames  <dig> cells was examined under inducing conditions . mutation of residues on the distal face  resulted in rescue of normal growth, as observed by the plate method . in contrast, mutation of key residues on the proximal face of hfq <dig>  did not restore normal growth . reversion of the rim residues to the e. coli sequence would have been expected to increase toxicity, if this site increased binding of critical rnas; instead, toxicity was somewhat decreased , which may be due to the disruption in hexamer formation . the relative importance of the distal face mutants is suggestive of mrna binding by hfq <dig>  as opposed to an mrna-srna pair leading to toxicity.

western blot analysis confirmed that each of the three hfq <dig> distal face mutants is abundantly expressed in b. anthracis, indicating that their normal growth is not due to loss of protein expression . the k53a  and rim revertant mutants are expressed, but do not exhibit stable hexamer formation under these gel conditions . similarly, the corresponding k56a e. coli hfq mutant is able to bind rna, despite apparent lack of hexamer formation as assessed on a semi-native gel  <cit> . we hypothesize that these mutants form transient hexamers that are capable of rna binding, but dissociate too quickly under semi-native gel conditions to be observed here. additionally, the toxicity of the k53a overexpression strain provides evidence that the toxicity of hfq <dig> is not due to hfq aggregation.

distal face hfq <dig> mutants also disrupt an e. coli complementation phenotype
in e. coli cells, hfq is required for translation of the rpos gene transcript; hfq binds and brings together the 5′ utr of rpos mrna with three different srnas, freeing the ribosome binding site . previously, we demonstrated that expression of his-hfq <dig> in a strain of ΔhfqΔlacz mg <dig> e. coli cells—in which expression of β-galactosidase is driven from an rpos-lacz translational fusion construct—partially rescued the Δhfq phenotype, as observed by the pink color on macconkey-lactose agar  and in quantitative β-galactosidase assays  <cit> . his-hfq <dig> exhibits no complementation, and serves as a negative control   <cit> . this is an artificial phenotype, since it  examines the impact of a b. anthracis hfq on an e. coli rna regulatory system and  utilizes heterologously expressed, his-tagged constructs. however, it provides an opportunity to examine the effects of our set of hfq <dig> mutants on an alternative, well-studied phenotype that is linked to rna binding.fig.  <dig> hfqs expressed in other bacterial species. a appearance of his-hfq <dig> mutants, constitutively expressed from the pqe <dig> vector in e. coli strain yn <dig>  on macconkey-ampicillin plates incubated for ≈ 16 h at 37 °c. his-hfq <dig> and his-hfq3-expressing cells are provided for reference. numbers utilized here and in the text are the b. anthracis residue numbers. b β-galactosidase assay on macconkey plate scrapings of yn <dig> strains expressing his-hfq <dig> mutants ≈ 16 h at 37 °c. bars reflect the average of measurements on three independent cultures, each obtained from an independent transformant; error bars depict +/- standard error of the mean . β-galactosidase values for reference e. coli strains cultured on macconkey agar  were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and 205 ±  <dig> miller units, respectively. c comparison of growth phenotypes of hfq <dig>  hfq <dig>  hfq3-r27a, and gfp overexpression in b. anthracis and b. subtilis; plates depict lb incubation at 37 °c in air  and nby/bicarbonate incubation at 37 °c in 15% co <dig> 




mutants in his-hfq <dig> exhibited defects in complementation of the e. coli Δhfq phenotype , with the largest decrease in complementation observed for the distal face mutants f21d and v26d . the proximal face mutants, as well as the distal face mutant r27a, exhibited a partial loss of the complementation phenotype . . denaturing lysate gels reveal that hfq <dig> protein accumulates in each of the mutants , suggesting that color differences cannot simply be ascribed to lack of his-hfq <dig> expression. therefore, residues involved in the toxic hfq <dig> overexpression phenotype were also involved in the complementation phenotype.

hfq <dig> expression in b. subtilis does not negatively impact growth
to further probe the physiological mechanism of hfq <dig> toxicity, we transformed psw4-hfq <dig> into b. subtilis strain py <dig>  expression from psw <dig> is not induced in b. subtilis by co <dig>  but occurs in both air and co <dig> conditions . in contrast to b. anthracis, the b. subtilis hfq <dig> expression strain grew normally . hfq <dig> protein was expressed in b. subtilis , indicating that the lack of phenotype is not due to lack of protein expression. the hfq3-r27a mutant had a change in appearance ; however, the hfq <dig> overexpression phenotypes in b. subtilis were clearly distinct from the phenotypes in b. anthracis. similar to hfq <dig> overexpression in b. anthracis, hfq <dig> expression in b. subtilis yielded an intermediate toxic effect, at a frequency of approximately 28% in  <dig> transformants . therefore, the hfq <dig> overexpression phenotype exhibits species specificity.

overexpression of hfq <dig> leads to aberrant b. anthracis cellular morphology
based on previous findings that overexpression of e. coli hfq inhibits cell division by decreasing ftsz expression levels  <cit> , we examined the impact of hfq <dig> overexpression on b. anthracis cell morphology. plate scrapings of transformants on lb were analyzed by differential interference contrast microscopy . the ames 35-hfq <dig> overexpression strain displayed an anomalous chain morphology compared to the ames  <dig> parent strain and the hfq <dig> overexpression strain, with shortened bacterial chains and an absence of characteristic rod formation . we emphasize the clear difference between the microscopic appearances of hfq <dig> and hfq <dig> overexpression strains under non-inducing conditions. in contrast, normal b. anthracis chain formation was observed for the distal face mutants . the aberrant shape of the hfq3-overexpressing cells  as compared to ames  <dig>  was also apparent by transmission electron microscopy.fig.  <dig> hfq <dig> strain physiology. samples for microscopy were prepared from lb plate scrapings for each strain. a differential interference contrast  microscopy using 63x objective; scale bar 5 μm.  ames  <dig> parent strain,  ames  <dig> overexpressing hfq <dig>   ames  <dig> overexpressing hfq <dig>  and  ames  <dig> overexpressing hfq <dig> distal face mutant r27a. b transmission electron microscopy  of b. anthracis strains at 1500x.  ames  <dig> parent strain and  ames  <dig> overexpressing hfq <dig>  c growth comparison of ames  <dig> parent strain  and hfq <dig> overexpression strain  patched to nby/bicarbonate incubated at 37 °c in 15% co <dig>  and to nby/bicarbonate supplemented with  <dig>  m sucrose,  <dig>  mm maleic acid, and 20 mm mgcl <dig> incubated at 37 °c in 15% co <dig> . d triton x- <dig> -induced cell autolysis of psw4-gfp  and psw4-hfq <dig>  overexpression strains. error bars reflect standard error of the mean  of three biological replicates for each strain. similar results were observed in two additional independent experiments




the rounded appearance of the hfq3-overexpressing cells and the visible defects in cell wall appearance suggest that the increased levels of hfq <dig> may impact the activity of mreb and/or the activity of a murein hydrolase in b. anthracis. an mreb mutant in b. subtilis exhibits issues with the maintenance of cell width as well as cell viability; these growth defects were reversible by propagation in media containing magnesium and sucrose  <cit> . however, supplementation of the nby/bicarbonate medium by sucrose and magnesium  did not restore normal growth of the hfq <dig> overexpression strain .

finally, to characterize the impact of hfq <dig> overexpression on the cell envelope, we compared the physiology of the b. anthracis hfq <dig> overexpression strain to the b. anthracis gfp overexpression strain. both strains exhibited similar sensitivities  to both vancomycin and ampicillin . additionally, both strains exhibited similar sensitivities to lysis by  <dig> % triton x- <dig> . the hfq <dig> overexpression strain was capable of spore formation, and the hfq <dig> overexpression plasmid was still toxic when transformed into a spo−
b. anthracis strain.

previously, our work elucidated the molecular properties of the unusual set of three distinct hfq proteins produced in the bacillus anthracis cell, including hfq <dig>  expressed from a gene located on the pxo <dig> virulence plasmid of the pathogen. here, we exploited the psw <dig> plasmid overexpression system as a tool to examine functions of hfq <dig> in vivo in b. anthracis. a similar overexpression strategy was successfully utilized to identify new binding activities of hfq in e. coli  <cit> , although we note that the e. coli system is distinct in its clear and diverse phenotypes observed in the Δhfq e. coli mutant. in b. anthracis, we observed a striking toxic effect of hfq <dig> overexpression, even at the lower levels observed under lb growth conditions. the toxic effect is dependent on hfq distal face residues implicated in mrna binding in e. coli, but independent of proximal face residues implicated in small rna binding. strikingly, toxicity was species specific and not simply a general effect; overexpression of hfq <dig> in b. subtilis did not cause the same growth defect.

we propose that increased intracellular concentrations of hfq <dig> lead to increased levels of binding of hfq3-interacting mrnas in the b. anthracis cell. this could interfere with cellular physiology either by sequestering and blocking translation of these mrnas due to the high hfq <dig> concentrations, or, alternatively, by increasing the rate of degradation and cycling of these mrnas. in e. coli, x sequences allow for mrna binding to the distal face of e. coli hfq; binding can then target mrnas for degradation in some cases  <cit> . the results for hfq <dig> overexpression in b. subtilis seem to suggest that the toxic phenotype is not due to general sequestration of all mrnas. the distal face mutagenesis does not directly demonstrate rna binding, and it is alternatively possible that the hfq <dig> overexpression phenotype is due to protein-protein interactions. however, the importance of residues previously demonstrated to disrupt mrna binding to e. coli hfq is suggestive of an mrna binding mechanism in the hfq3-overexpressing cells.

a recent study in clostridium difficile—a species in which hfq knockdown leads to significant growth defects —identified changes in transcript levels of genes involved in cell wall structure and transport in the absence of hfq  <cit> . importantly, hfq depletion in c. difficile led to cell elongation and cell wall deformation, leading boudry et al.  <cit>  to propose that hfq regulation influences c. difficile cell wall composition. while the Δhfq strain of b. anthracis used here exhibits normal growth in rich media, our findings suggest that hfqs may be playing more subtle roles in the physiology of b. anthracis. the collapse of normal cell shape and chain formation in the hfq <dig> overexpressing cells could be consistent with an impact on cell wall formation and cell division, correlating with some of the functions in c. difficile. alternatively, the toxic phenotype could be due to other cellular impacts, such as loss of membrane integrity or sequestration of rnas involved in other essential cell functions. the results of the antibiotic sensitivity and autolysis assays suggest that the phenotype does not involve differences in peptidoglycan crosslinking/teichoic acid structure .

while overexpression of hfq <dig> appears to lead to toxicity as well, the hfq <dig> phenotype is distinct in its presence at lower relative levels of protein expression, as observed from the difference in cellular appearance under air  conditions. the hfq <dig> phenotype may be the result of weaker binding of the same rna to the hfq <dig> hexamer when the protein reaches higher levels in the cell. we note that we cannot rule out the possibility that growth of the hfq <dig> overexpression strain reflects rapid accumulation and growth of suppressor mutants.

combined with the findings in b. anthracis, our mutational analysis in e. coli strengthens the argument for the importance of the distal face in hfq3’s functional capabilities. additionally, the difference in the hfq <dig> rim sequence is suggestive of differences between hfq <dig> and e. coli hfq in their abilities to bring together srnas and their target mrnas for regulation. previously, we modeled the structure and charges of the hfq <dig> hexamer, based on its amino acid sequence  <cit> . the proximal face is predicted to have an inner ring of positive charges, similar to s. aureus hfq, but also exhibits significant patches of rna-repelling negative charge, in contrast to the findings from e. coli hfq’s crystal structure. the hfq <dig> distal face is predicted to have a greater distribution of positive charge that may be favorable for mrna binding. another potential variable is the very short length of the hfq <dig> c-terminal tail, which still allows for hexamer formation, but may impact the srna-binding function of hfq <dig> 

overall, the finding of a b. anthracis-specific overexpression phenotype for hfq <dig> is novel for a gram-positive species, and provides an impetus for the further study of hfq3-associated functions in b. anthracis. the next steps for research on the function of this protein will be to elucidate the impact of reduction in hfq <dig> levels on the b. anthracis transcriptome, with the results presented here as a point of comparison for identification of transcripts potentially linked to impacts on cellular structure or metabolism. additionally, the results presented here provide the foundation for a much more targeted exploration of potential phenotypes of Δhfq <dig> b. anthracis cells. further analysis is important in understanding the level of physiological relevance of the findings from the overexpression system. to this end, we conducted a preliminary transcriptome analysis of an hfq <dig> deletion mutant of ames  <dig>  as compared to the wild-type strain grown in nby + bicarbonate  to late log phase . these initial results suggest that there are gene expression differences in the absence of hfq <dig> that may have impacts on cellular physiology. of potential future interest would also be the role of hfqs in the context of the pxo <dig> plasmid, present in fully virulent strains of b. anthracis and responsible for capsule formation.

finally, we propose that the relative importance of distal face mrna-dependent mechanisms, as opposed to srna-mrna pairing mechanisms, may be of broader importance in rna regulation in gram-positive species. such mechanisms would be consistent with the small subset of srna-independent mechanisms for post-transcriptional regulation of certain mrnas in e. coli  <cit> .
