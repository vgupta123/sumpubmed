BACKGROUND
sex determination is a fundamental developmental process that contributes to the establishment of sexually dimorphic traits, including the sexual differentiation of gonads, and leads to sex-specific differences in behavior and physiology. sex determination systems can be divided into two major categories: genotypic sex determination  and environmental sex determination   <cit> . gsd is attributed to the genetic segregation of genes, often residing on sex chromosomes that initially trigger and govern the alteration of sex-specific developmental pathways. in contrast, esd, which has been repeatedly acquired during animal evolution  <cit> , is initiated by plural external environmental cues such as temperature, photoperiod and population density, that trigger alternative genetic cascades, resulting in the activation of male or female fate-determining genes  <cit> .

the cladoceran crustacean genus daphnia is a representative organism bearing the esd system. under natural favorable environmental conditions, daphnia produce female offspring by parthenogenesis. however, when an adult female receives unfavorable environmental cues such as low temperature, low food quality, high individual density, or short day-length, daphnia produce male offspring, thus altering their reproductive mode to sexual reproduction  <cit> . parthenogenesis allows rapid proliferation during favorable seasons whereas sexual reproduction contributes to an increase in genetic diversity and fitness to deal with changing habitat conditions  <cit> . thus, the mechanisms underlying sexual fate determination that depend on external environmental conditions are important for daphnids as these will allow them to fit reproductive strategies appropriately to seasonally changing environments  <cit> .

previous studies demonstrated that daphnids administrated with juvenile hormones  or their analogs induced male offspring even under female-producing conditions  <cit> . in response to parental activation of methyl farnesoate  signaling, doublesex <dig> is specifically expressed in the male embryos, and is indispensable for the development of male traits such as testis formation and first antenna elongation  <cit> . these results suggest that parental mf signaling activated by unfavorable environmental cues affects the developing oocytes during the oocyte maturation stage  <cit>  and determines their sexual fate  <cit> . however, the regulatory mechanisms of mf signaling and the following downstream pathway for male offspring production have not been clarified yet.

we have successfully established an innovative experimental system using d. pulex wtn <dig> strain. in this strain, the offspring sex can be controlled by simply changing the day length conditions; a mother produces female progeny reared under long-day conditions , whereas male progeny emerges under short-day conditions   <cit> .

in this study, to investigate the up- and downstream events of mf signaling, we reared adult d. pulex wtn <dig> strain under the following conditions: long-day , short-day  and long-day with mf treatment . the gene expression profiles of the ovary and whole body of these adults at the mf-sensitive period for male offspring production were compared by rna-seq analysis. we found that the expression levels of ionotropic glutamate receptor-related genes had changed significantly in response to the short-day condition, but not to mf treatment. using pharmacological manipulation of ionotropic glutamate receptors, we demonstrated that n-methyl-d-aspartic acid  receptors  are essential factors for male offspring production in d. pulex acting as an upstream regulator of mf signaling. our findings not only provide a molecular component to explain the esd mechanism but also contribute to elucidate how organisms convert environmental information into phenotypic changes.

RESULTS
differentially expressed genes in response to short-day and mf treatment
at first, we screened differentially expressed genes  between female- and male-producing mothers as follows. the focal d. pulex strain, wtn <dig>  can rigorously discriminate the sexual fate of its offspring  <cit> . briefly, under the long-day condition, it produces 100% female offspring . in contrast, the offspring sex ratio reaches 100% male under the short-day condition or exogenous treatment with mf under the long-day condition   <cit> . rna-seq analysis was performed using the aforementioned three types of conditioned mothers at a mf-sensitive period, i.e., long-day , short-day  and long-day with mf treatment  conditions . prior to rna sampling, we confirmed that all mothers were strictly conditioned in this way .figure  <dig>

illumina hiseq <dig> sequencing yielded a total of  <dig> , <dig> paired-end reads . the transcriptome assembly process produced  <dig>  putative transcripts using trinity. the n <dig> value and the mean length of assembled contigs, which are representative statistics of transcriptome assembly, are  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. these scores are consistent with recent studies of some insect and crustacean species  <cit> , suggesting that our transcriptome data provides a good resource for investigating the molecular mechanisms of esd in d. pulex. we identified  <dig>  orfs  in the assembled transcript sequences. among them,  <dig>  had significant blast similarity hits with publicly available protein sequences,  <dig>  were assigned go terms according to the genome project in d. pulex  <cit> , and  <dig>  were consistent with gene models constructed by the daphnia genomics consortium  <cit> .

among  <dig>  constructed transcripts,  <dig> and  <dig>  were differentially expressed in the ovary in response to the short-day condition and mf treatment, respectively . similarly, in the whole body, we found  <dig> and  <dig>  degs responding to the short-day condition and mf treatment, respectively .figure  <dig>

upstream factors of mf signaling
in this experimental design, we first compared the female-producing long-day condition, male-producing short-day condition and male-producing mf-treated condition. genes differentially expressed exclusively in the short-day condition were designated as candidates for upstream of mf signaling, whereas mutual genes differentially expressed in both the short-day and mf-treated conditions were designated as candidates for downstream of mf signaling . based on these criteria, we identified  <dig> and  <dig> degs responding to the short-day condition in the ovary and whole body, respectively, as the candidate transcripts regulating the upstream process of mf signaling . in response to short-day  condition, four transcripts  were more abundant in ovary with log2-transformed fold change  values between  <dig>  and  <dig> , whereas nineteen transcripts  were differentially expressed in whole body with log2-transformed fc values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . however, not only approximately 80% of the candidate genes in both sample categories could be classified into functionally unknown groups , but also molecular functions of these genes annotated with the regulation of the mf signaling remain largely unclear. then, we next performed gene ontology  enrichment analysis  <cit>  to provide an overview of the potential candidate gene sets involved in the upstream of mf signaling governing male offspring production in d. pulex.

in comparison with the long-day and short-day conditions, go terms  corresponding to ionotropic glutamate receptor activity, extracellular-glutamate-gated ion channel activity and glutamate receptor activity showed significant differences in both the ovary and the whole body. the upper-hierarchy of these terms also varied significantly . this finding was strongly consistent with our previous study in which administration of mk- <dig>  a specific antagonist of ionotropic glutamate receptors, suppressed male offspring production in d. pulex  <cit> .table  <dig>

intriguingly, intracellular calcium signaling might be activated in response to the short-day condition, because the expression levels of genes associated with intracellular calcium influx, such as calcium channel activity, changed significantly in both the ovary and whole body categories . previous studies in several insects reported that an elevation of free intracellular calcium modulated by ionotropic glutamate receptors is necessary for increasing jh biosynthesis in the corpora allata, which is a jh-synthesizing organ in insects  <cit> . therefore, ionotropic glutamate receptors might regulate the intracellular calcium concentration to modulate endogenous mf levels in daphnids as well as in insect species.

also, among the go category of biological process, we revealed that the expression levels of genes labeled with cell surface receptor signaling pathway, sensory perception and neurological system process showed significant changes only in the ovary in response to the short-day condition, but not to mf treatment . the terms of the cell surface receptor signaling pathway belong to an upper-hierarchy term of glutamate receptor signaling pathway . besides, the co-occurrence statistics for sensory perception and neurological system process using quickgo  indicated that sensory perception co-occurs with regulation of n-methyl-d-aspartate selective glutamate receptor activity , while neurological system process co-occurs with glutamate binding  and glutamate receptor activity . these results suggest that genes assigned with cell surface receptor signaling pathway, sensory perception and neurological system process might be involved in the regulation of ionotropic glutamate receptors. on the other hand, expression changes in genes annotated with regulation of n-methyl-d-aspartate selective glutamate receptor activity and/or glutamate binding were not observed between the long-day and short-day conditions. these data also implied a possibility that genes related to sensory perception and neurological system process might be involved in the reception mechanism of the short-day cues acting as primary environmental signals for esd in the wtn <dig> strain.table  <dig>

we also found that sulfotransferase activity and its upper-hierarchy terms , which are terms that belong to the molecular function category, varied significantly only in the ovary in response to the short-day condition . although sulfotransferase-related genes might be one of the candidates for the upstream element of mf signaling, a causal relationship between those genes and the regulatory mechanism of mf remains largely unknown. further analyses will be required to elucidate the molecular functions of sulfotransferase-related genes in the regulation of mf signaling for the esd system in d. pulex. these findings provide important clues about the molecular signaling cascade regulating male offspring production in response to the short-day condition in d. pulex.

administration of agonists and antagonists of ionotropic glutamate receptor subtypes
the ionotropic glutamate receptors are divided into three subtypes based on their pharmacological characteristics; nmda-type, -α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid -type and kainate-type receptors. as described above, we previously reported that administration of mk- <dig> suppresses male offspring production in d. pulex wtn <dig> strain reared under the short-day condition  <cit> ; however, mk- <dig> can only block the nmda-type among these subtypes. to investigate the molecular functions of ionotropic glutamate receptors and the contribution of each subtype to male induction, we performed detailed exposure experiments using several specific agonists and antagonists of ionotropic glutamate receptors. first, we exposed mothers reared under the long-day or short-day conditions to mk- <dig> or  <dig> -dioxo-6-nitro- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydrobenzoquinoxaline-7-sulfonamide , a specific antagonist for ampa and kainate receptors. treatment of these antagonists did not affect the proportion of female-producing mothers reared under the long-day condition . on the other hand, administration of mk- <dig> to daphnids reared under the short-day condition strongly suppressed the proportion of male-producing mothers and importantly, its phenotype was restored when treated with exogenous mf , which is highly reproducible data with a previous study  <cit> . in addition to mk- <dig>  nbqx treatment seemed to suppress the proportion of male-producing mothers, although the effect was not significant . a reduction in the proportion of male-producing mothers following the administration of nbqx was also recovered by co-treatment with mf . in this experiment, mothers always produced either female or male offspring in a clutch .figure  <dig> 
effects of antagonists of ionotropic glutamate receptors  on the inducibility of male offspring by mothers. upper and lower panels show the effect of these antagonists on d. pulex reared under the  long-day and  short-day conditions, respectively. vertical values indicate the proportion of male-producing mothers . bars indicate the 95% confidence interval. the asterisks indicate significant differences compared to respective controls . concentrations of mf and antagonists used are as follows: mf , mk- <dig> , and nbqx . mk-801: -mk- <dig> hydrogen maleate, nbqx:  <dig> -dioxo-6-nitro- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydrobenzoquinoxaline-7-sulfonamide disodium salt hydrate.



we then applied agonists for ionotropic glutamate receptors  to daphnids reared under the long-day condition, and found that the proportion of male-producing mothers increased in response to treatment of each single agonist and their combinations . although not statistically significant, nmda administration showed the strongest effect on male induction among them . on the other hand, all agonists showed no effect on the proportion of male-producing mothers reared under the short-day condition . as in antagonist treatment experiments, mothers always produced either female or male offspring in a clutch . taken together, the current results suggest that the activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors is essential for male offspring production in d. pulex, and that the process of male induction might be primarily mediated by nmda receptors, although some contributions of ampa and kainate receptors should also be considered.figure  <dig>

the present results suggest that nmda receptors act on the upstream of mf signaling, however, signal cascades connecting nmda receptors and the activation of mf signaling remain largely unknown. previously, the tgfβ signaling pathway was identified as a potential candidate connecting nmda receptor to jh synthesis in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . in the corpora allata of d. melanogaster, tgfβ signaling, which is mediated by decapentaplegic , thickveins and mothers against decapentaplegic , contributes to the regulation of jh biosynthesis via induction of juvenile hormone o-methyltransferase , a critical enzyme of jh synthesis  <cit> . our previous study revealed that jhamt is a key factor for modulating the innate mf levels governing the esd in d. pulex  <cit> . although the expression of tgfβ signaling pathway-related genes did not change between the short-day and the long-day conditions in our rna-seq experiments, further investigations concerning tgfβ signaling are necessary to elucidate the signal cascades between nmda receptors and activation of jhamt expression in d. pulex.

most aphid species are known to exhibit cyclical parthenogenesis and esd in a manner much like the daphnids. it has been reported that the autumnal shortened day-length induce the sexual morph that produces male and oviparous female  <cit> , and topical application of jh to oviparous producer induces the parthenogenetic female in pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum  <cit> . moreover, recent progress in omics technologies  have allowed the large-scale screening of candidate factors responsible for the switch from parthenogenetic morph to sexual morph induced by shortening of the photoperiod  <cit> . interestingly, juvenile hormone esterase  was identified as a key element for the induction of sexual morph by the jh iii titer decrease in response to short-day condition  <cit> . this finding indicates relationship between endogenous jh iii/mf titer in the mothers and sexual outcome of the offspring is an opposite phenomenon in pea aphids and daphnids: high innate jh iii titer induces female progeny in pea aphids and male progeny in daphnids. nmda receptor might act in the singling pathway between receptions of shortened day-length and regulation of innate jh iii titer in pea aphids as well as in daphnids. to investigate the common principle of esd system among them, further comparative analyses will be necessary.

downstream factors of mf signaling
finally, we screened the downstream candidates of mf signaling as the mutual degs in response to both the short-day condition and mf treatment . we obtained  <dig> and  <dig> degs in the ovary and whole body, respectively . in response to short-day condition, seventeen transcripts  were more enriched in ovary with log2-transformed fc values between  <dig>  and  <dig> , whereas twenty-five transcripts  were differentially expressed in whole body with log2-transformed fc values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . further, candidate genes in the whole body contained several serine protease and hemoglobin-related genes, known as mf-responsive genes in daphnids  <cit> , implying that this experimental design possesses higher reliability to select factors involved in downstream of mf signaling. in addition, more than 50% of the candidate genes could not be attributed to any annotations , suggesting that those genes might be novel candidates for sexual fate determination via mf signaling in d. pulex .

go enrichment analysis showed that expression levels of genes associated with protein tyrosine kinase activity and calcium ion transmembrane transporter activity terms varied significantly in response to the short-day condition and mf treatment, especially in the ovary . although recent studies indicated that jh acts via intracellular-type receptors to modulate downstream gene expression  <cit> , some studies implied that jh actions are mediated via plasma membrane-type receptors involving calcium ion and protein kinase c in d. melanogaster  <cit>  and two crustaceans, barnacle balanus amphitrite  <cit>  and the crayfish cherax quadricarinatus  <cit> . based on this knowledge, it is suggested that mf signal transduction from the mother  to oocytes is regulated by not only transcriptional gene cascades via intracellular-type jh receptors but also by phosphorylation cascades through the protein kinase c family in the ovary of daphnids. to prove this hypothesis, further exposure experiments using activators and inhibitors of protein kinase c will be required.

CONCLUSIONS
we conducted transcriptome analyses using rna-seq to shed light on the signaling cascades underlying the esd system in d. pulex. we identified several candidate gene sets of the mf pathway regulating the esd of d. pulex, including nmda receptors, as a primary upstream regulator of mf signaling . moreover, the phosphorylation signaling cascades via protein kinase c might be implicated in the downstream pathway of mf signaling . although further investigation concerning the characterization of nmda receptors and protein kinase c gene families will be required, our findings not only provide important clues involved in the molecular signaling cascade regulating male offspring production in response to the short-day condition in d. pulex, but also contribute to elucidate how animals transmit information from the external environmental and transform it into phenotypic alterations.figure  <dig>
