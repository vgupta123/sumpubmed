BACKGROUND
cattle twins are well known as blood chimeras  <cit> . vascular anastomosis occurs in about 92% of cases, from the 10- to 15-mm crown-rump stage or 30– <dig> days gestation  <cit> . the blood is thus effectively mixed between the fetuses for most of the 280-day gestation. postnatally, the twins permanently share composite blood types. this suggests that hematopoietic stem cells  are exchanged and successfully engraft in the recipient  <cit> . however, direct assessment of chimerism in the hematopoietic progenitor compartment has not been possible due to technical limitations.

donor-derived cells can be readily identified in a cow born as a twin to a bull, as only bull cells contain a y chromosome. such chimeric females are usually nonfertile and are called freemartins  <cit> . we have previously used genomic in situ hybridization to analyze the fates of bull-derived cells in freemartin tissues  <cit> . recently, we produced an antibody against the bovine sialomucin cd <dig> for identification of cattle hematopoietic progenitors  <cit> . here, we combine these tools to directly observe bull-derived hematopoietic progenitors in the liver of an early fetal freemartin.

RESULTS
fetal liver and thymus were obtained from triplet fetuses in a superovulated cow. the developmental age of the fetuses was  <dig> days gestation  <cit> . at this stage of mammalian development, the fetal liver is the major hematopoietic organ  <cit> . the sex of the fetuses was determined by y-chromosome-specific in situ hybridization  to nonhematopoietic tissues. two of the fetuses were male , while one was confirmed as a chimeric female .

the liver of the freemartin fetus was then analyzed by combining y-ish and anti-cd <dig> immunofluorescence . livers from normal nonchimeric male and female fetuses were used as positive  and negative  controls, respectively. double positive  cells were frequently observed in the freemartin liver, indicating the presence of bull-derived hematopoietic progenitors. y+ and y- cells often occurred in separate clusters, suggesting local clonal expansion . around y+cd34+ clusters, y+cd34- cells were typically observed . these probably represent differentiating cells derived from the y+ progenitors. alternatively, these may be nonhematopoietic stromal cells.

in the freemartin liver,  <dig> ±  <dig> % of cd34+ cells were y chromosome positive, while the proportions in the livers of the male siblings were  <dig> ±  <dig> % and  <dig> ±  <dig> % . the freemartin liver thus contained significantly less double positive cells . the difference between the two bull fetuses was not statistically significant. the thymus of the freemartin fetus also contained high numbers of y+ cells. here, the differences between animals were less pronounced than in the liver and masked by interlobular variation. there is a strong correlation between levels of bull-derived white blood cells in freemartin calves and their twin brothers . the vascular anastomoses in multiple pregnancies enable lymphohematopoietic tissues like the liver, thymus and the bone marrow of each fetus to be populated from a common circulatory pool of progenitor cells. the relatively low level of bull-derived cd34+ cells in the female fetus in the current study is compatible with the seeding of liver beginning prior to the establishment of a functional anastomosis, which normally occurs at around  <dig> to  <dig> days of gestation  <cit> . alternatively, a portion of the immigrant cells could reach the liver directly by migrating through the tissues via a nonvascular route. the interlobular variation in the level of bull-derived cells in the thymus probably reflects corresponding fluctuation in the early circulatory pool of migratory lymphoid progenitors. the interlobular differences are no longer apparent in twin calves and juvenile animals  as thymus continuously accepts new lymphoid progenitors.

we have previously shown that the y-ish method applied here is extremely specific and sufficiently sensitive  <cit> . no false positives were detected in more than  <dig> samples of various tissues from normal females . a proportion of bull-derived cells are not detected, as the y chromosome may be excluded from the section. in normal bull tissues, generally 40–70% of cells are labelled depending on the cell type .

cd <dig> is a transmembrane glycoprotein commonly used as a marker for enrichment of human hematopoietic stem cells  <cit> . while the cd34+fraction is heterogenous and contains also some committed precursors  <cit> , cd <dig> remains as one of the best known markers for primitive hematopoietic cells  <cit> . recently, bovine cd34+ cells were shown to be enriched for hematopoietic progenitors as measured by bfu-e  and cfu-gm  readouts  <cit> . the polyclonal antibody used in our study specifically recognizes bovine cd <dig>  <cit> . in addition, it labels erythroid cells. these were excluded from the analysis by pseudoperoxidase staining, as described in methods.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study to directly demonstrate bull-derived hematopoietic progenitors in fetal freemartin cattle. the fetal liver contains clusters of bull-derived cells, suggesting clonal expansion and differentiation. the lower level of bull-derived hematopoietic progenitors in the freemartin vs. her bull siblings suggest that the seeding of fetal liver starts already before the onset of vascular anastomosis. the level of chimerism in the circulating migratory hematopoietic progenitors thus only partially determines the level of donor-derived fetal hematopoiesis. despite this, the freemartin hematopoietic system is strongly chimeric already from early stages of fetal development.
