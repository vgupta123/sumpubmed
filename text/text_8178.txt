BACKGROUND
dynactin is a multisubunit protein complex in eukaryotic cells required as an activator of cytoplasmic dynein, the major minus end-directed microtubule motor
 <cit> . dynactin acts as an adapter between dynein and the cargo
 <cit>  and enhances the movement of dynein by increasing its processivity
 <cit> . the dynein-dynactin complex plays an important role during mitosis
 <cit>  and is necessary for synapse stabilization
 <cit> . it is involved in nuclear migration, and during cell division in mitotic spindle positioning
 <cit>  and organization of spindle microtubule arrays
 <cit> . although most of dynactins functions are in conjunction with cytoplasmic dynein it also binds to and modulates kinesin-2
 <cit>  and kinesin-5
 <cit> .

dynactin is composed of eleven different subunits ranging in size from  <dig> to 150 kda
 <cit> . several components are present as dimers or oligomers in the complex resulting in an overall molecular weight of  <dig>  mda. the novel dynactin subunits have initially been named according to the molecular weights of the vertebrate subunits in sds gels
 <cit> . however, as the molecular weights differ between species the original naming is not adequate to describe the protein family relation of the subunits in all eukaryotes. therefore and because these subunits are unique to the dynactin complex we adopt and use the nomenclature dynactin <dig> to dynactin <dig> , which has recently been established by the hugo gene nomenclature committee , throughout this analysis.

the structure of the complex can be divided into two distinct domains: the arp <dig> rod and the projecting arm
 <cit> . the projecting arm  links dynactin to cytoplasmic dynein, kinesin motors, and microtubules. it is composed of two dynactin <dig> , four dynactin <dig> , and two dynactin <dig> subunits . the arp <dig> rod is built of eight arp <dig> molecules forming a short actin-like filament, probably one β-actin molecule, and the conventional actin capping proteins capα and capβ, which are located at the barbed-end of the mini-filament. the other end of the filament is terminated by arp <dig>  and dynactin <dig> , to which the dynactin <dig>  and dynactin <dig>  subunits are associated. the heterotetrameric complex of dynactin <dig>  dynactin <dig>  dynactin <dig> and arp <dig> is also called pointed-end complex.

dynactin <dig> is the largest subunit of the dynactin complex
 <cit>  and belongs to the microtubule plus end-binding protein family
 <cit> . the microtubule-binding cap-gly  domain is located at the n-terminus
 <cit> . the cap-gly domain is connected to the other subunits of the complex via two long coiled-coil regions. the first coiled-coil region following the cap-gly domain binds to the intermediate chain of cytoplasmic dynein
 <cit> . dynactin <dig> is the connection between the projecting arm and the arp <dig> rod
 <cit>  and its over-expression in vivo causes disruption of the dynactin complex
 <cit> . dynactin <dig> is required for attachment of dynactin <dig> to dynactin2
 <cit> . arp <dig> is the actin-related protein most similar to actin and forms an actin-like mini-filament
 <cit>  that represents the backbone of dynactin, to which the other dynactin subunits bind. it is supposed that membranous cargoes bind to dynactin via the arp <dig> rod
 <cit> .

the first studies on dynactin have been performed with chicken brain samples
 <cit> . subsequently, dynactin subunits have been identified and analyzed in the model organisms neurospora crassa <cit> , saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> , drosophila melanogaster <cit>  and caenorhabditis elegans <cit> . although the composition of the dynactin complex in vertebrates gradually became apparent, a thorough analysis of the complex and its subunits in terms of gene duplicates, alternatively spliced isoforms, and phylogenetic evolution is still missing. that a surprising diversity might be found has been shown by a recent study of the motor protein repertoire of  <dig> insect genomes uncovering a branch specific duplication of the well-known dynactin <dig>  gene in drosophila species
 <cit> .

building such a multi-protein complex with a filament of fixed size seems rather complicated. because most of the analyses of the complex have been done with vertebrate samples, it would be interesting to see whether the various unicellular protists that often have smaller gene repertoires, may have evolved compacted versions of the dynactin complex. vice-versa, there could have been a minimal dynactin complex at the origin of the eukaryotes that multicellular eukaryotes expanded to accomplish more and different tasks. here, we examined every known protein of the complex and determined its absence and presence in all eukaryotic genomes as available in september  <dig>  furthermore, we inspected all genes to identify alternatively spliced exons and their appearance during evolution. for our analysis, we manually assembled and annotated more than  <dig>  dynactin and actin-related protein sequences from about  <dig> species. all sequences were inspected and validated at the genomic dna level to remove wrongly predicted sequence regions, to manually fill gaps in gene predictions, and to reveal the correct exon/intron boundaries. the sequences and related data like gene structure reconstructions and biochemical properties are available through cymobase .

RESULTS
identification of dynactin genes
dynactin protein sequences are not as strongly conserved as for example tubulins, and three of the dynactin subunits are relatively short complicating their identification if they were spread on several exons. in addition, dynactin contains two actin-related proteins of which arp <dig> is closely related to actin while arp <dig> is a very divergent member thus hindering their immediate identification. the dynactin subunits might have been duplicated in single species or certain branches, like the drosophila dynactin <dig> gene
 <cit> . these events can only be revealed through the phylogenetic analysis of the corresponding protein sequences. thus, it is of major importance to obtain the best sequence data possible and to create the most accurate multiple sequence alignments. automatic gene predictions are error-prone , and even those gene predictions are available for only a small subset of all sequenced eukaryotic genomes
 <cit> . therefore, we manually assembled and annotated all dynactin and actin-related sequences used in this study. manual identification and assembly means that we started from a set of sequences verified by cdna and used those for searches with standard tools like tblastn in the genome assemblies. unfortunately, only a few full-length mrna/cdna sequences for dynactin subunits are available, which served as representatives for correct sequences. every search hit has further been analysed by manual inspection of the corresponding genomic dna sequence either to reveal the correct intron/exon boundaries or to extend hits that only covered short parts of the search sequence. those sequences were excluded, for which some local similarity was identified  but for which the remaining parts of the respective subunits could not be found although the genomic sequences of the respective contigs were long enough. genomes, for which the respective dynactin subunits could not unambiguously be assembled in the first instance, were reanalysed as soon as further data was added to the multiple sequence alignments. in this way the completeness of the search for dynactin subunits and the accuracy of the gene assembly and annotation has continuously been re-evaluated and improved. in addition to manually assembling all sequences, the multiple sequence alignments of the dynactin sequences have been created and were maintained and improved manually .

sequences of which small parts were missing due to gaps in the genome assemblies  were termed “partials”. “partials” are not expected to considerably influence the phylogenetic tree computations. sequences of which more than 5% were missing due to genome assembly gaps or incomplete est data but that are otherwise unambiguous orthologs or paralogs were termed “fragments”. "fragments" are important to denote the presence of the subunits in the respective species in the qualitative analysis. dynactin genes were termed pseudogenes if they contain more features like frame shifts and in-frame stop codons and miss more conserved sequence regions than can be attributed to sequencing or assembly errors.

in total, the dynactin dataset contains  <dig> sequences from  <dig> organisms , of which  <dig> have been derived from  <dig> wgs sequencing projects.  <dig> sequences are complete, and an additional  <dig> sequences are partially complete. in addition,  <dig> actin and actin-related proteins from  <dig> species have been assembled to finally reveal the subfamily relationship of potential arp <dig> and arp <dig> orthologs in questionable cases. for plotting the presence or absence of dynactin subunits across the tree of the eukaryotes we only included those species whose genomes have been sequenced with high coverage and which provided reliable data in many other cases
 <cit> . nevertheless, low-coverage genomes have also been analysed because every single piece of sequence could be very important to resolve ambiguous regions in related species or to clarify phylogenetic question. for example, we also analysed the incomplete genome of the agnath petromyzon marinus to reveal at which stage alternative splice forms had been evolved in vertebrate evolution. to infer the phylogenetic relationship of duplicated dynactin subunits we calculated phylogenetic trees using the maximum likelihood and bayesian methods. gene structures were reconstructed for all sequences using webscipio
 <cit>  and can be inspected via cymobase  for further investigation.

dynactin1
dynactin <dig> plays a major role for the function of the dynactin complex as it connects the arp <dig> rod, and thus the cargo binding sites, to cytoplasmic dynein, the transporter protein complex, and to microtubules, the track. it can hardly be imagined to build a functional dynactin complex without a dynactin <dig> subunit. however, dynactin <dig> is also the least conserved of the dynactin subunits . this is most likely due to its domain structure that consists of a short n-terminal globular cap-gly domain followed by two coiled-coil regions, which account for two thirds of its primary sequence. both the region separating the two coiled-coil regions and the c-terminal region are not even conserved between metazoan and fungal dynactin <dig> subunits, which belong to the opisthokont branch. given the functional importance of dynactin <dig> we were surprised not to be able to identify homologs in any apicomplexa, in the heterolobosea naegleria gruberi, and the apusozoa thecamonas trahens . when searching for dynactin <dig> homologs in these organisms we analysed all tblastn and psi-blast hits showing sequence similarity to cap-gly domains but we only found other cap-gly domain containing proteins like clip-170/restin
 <cit> , and the tubulin-specific chaperones b and e
 <cit> .

duplicates of dynactin <dig> have been found in independent branches of the eukaryotic tree . in the brachycera branch  the dynactin <dig> gene has been duplicated once
 <cit> . another duplication of dynactin <dig> was found in the actinopterygii branch, supported by brachydanio rerio, takifugu rubripes, and gasterosteus aculeatus. some of the nematods like brugia malayi also encode two versions of dynactin <dig>  two duplications of dynactin <dig> were found in the genome of the fungus rhizopus arrhizus, and one additional dynactin <dig> in mucor circinelloides. the variant a and b subunits each grouped together, suggesting a gene duplication predating the separation of the two species. variant c of rhizopus arrhizus grouped to variant b indicating another rhizopus-specific duplication.

the dynactin <dig> gene of homo sapiens is encoded in  <dig> exons on chromosome  <dig> . all exons are constitutively expressed and present in all dynactin <dig> transcripts, except for exon  <dig> , the second part of exon  <dig> , exon  <dig> , and exon  <dig>  that are alternatively spliced . some alternative transcripts have already been described based on the analysis of a fetal human cdna library  suggesting that exons 5– <dig> are each differentially included. in order to reveal a more general view of possible transcripts we extensively searched for corresponding sequences of vertebrate species in the available est and cdna databases and found the following combinations for exons 5– <dig> :

none of the alternative exons is included in the transcript 

exon  <dig> included, resulting in four additional positively charged residues 

exon  <dig> included, three additional positively charged residues 

exon  <dig> and  <dig> included, seven additional positively charged residues 

exon  <dig> and  <dig> included, five additional positively charged residues 

exon  <dig>   <dig> und  <dig> included, nine additional positively charged residues
 <cit>  and red dots highlight residues that are part of the conserved eey/f motif binding site
 <cit> . some mutations as found in human diseases are given below the reference sequences with numbering referring to human dynactin <dig> 

we did not find est or cdna-data for transcripts including only exon  <dig> , or est-data including exons  <dig> and  <dig> without exon  <dig> . exon  <dig> is also a differentially included exon. maybe because of lack of more full-length cdna data or maybe because of tight regulation, exon  <dig> is found to be absent in dynactin1-Δ <dig> , <dig>  and to be present in dynactin1-Δ <dig> and dynactin <dig> . in addition, transcripts are generated from three alternative start positions. the first is at the beginning of exon  <dig>  the second is at the beginning of exon  <dig>  and the third possible transcript starts with exon  <dig> , which corresponds to the “p135” construct. while transcript start sites  <dig> and  <dig> are found in all described combinations of exons 5– <dig> and exon  <dig>  transcript start site  <dig>  is only found in combination with exon  <dig> included and either exon  <dig> included or spliced out.

interestingly, the alternative exons encode different numbers of basic residues, arginines and lysines. although only six of the eight possible combinations of the alternative exons have been found in est and cdna data so far, vertebrates seem to be able to stepwise increase the number of basic residues in this region from zero to nine. the basic residues influence the sliding behaviour of dynactin along the microtubules with fewer charges allowing a faster diffusion
 <cit> . the function of the region including the fourth differentially included exon, exon  <dig>  which is located subsequent to the second coiled-coil region and thus behind a proposed arp <dig> binding site
 <cit> , has not been analysed so far. while the third transcription start site produces a dynactin <dig> without a cap-gly domain  the functional difference between transcripts of the two other transcription start sites is not known yet. the longer n-terminus  is not visible in any of the available crystal structures of dynactin <dig> cap-gly domains
 <cit> . in addition, a solution state structure  revealed that the n-terminus is an unstructured and unordered coil.

there is another alternative transcript generated by retention of intron  <dig> . this intron retention results in a premature stop codon and has only been found in combination with transcription start site  <dig>  the resulting transcript includes the cap-gly microtubule binding domain and the dynein intermediate chain binding site but stops before the second proposed coiled-coil region. the c-terminal part of dynactin <dig> starting with the second coiled-coil region has been proposed to bind to arp <dig> and truncation mutants of drosophila dynactin <dig> have been shown not to be incorporated into dynactin
 <cit> . this most likely also accounts for the alternative transcripts including intron  <dig> of vertebrate dynactin <dig> 

the alternatively spliced exons and transcription start sites are conserved in all vertebrates and were also found in the agnath petromyzon marinus the sistergroup of all gnathostomes representing the deepest separation in extant vertebrates. especially the lysines and arginines and their positions are invariant. however, in the fish type a dynactin <dig> subunits the exons  <dig> have been lost, as well as the third potential translation start in exon  <dig>  instead, exon  <dig> encodes only the part that is alternatively spliced in type b dynactin <dig>  thus a “p135”-like isoform cannot be build from fish type a dynactin <dig> subunits. alternatively spliced isoforms have not been identified in any other of the analysed species.

the sequence conservation plot across all dynactin <dig> cap-gly domains shows that the core structure consisting of six beta-strands and several key residues for binding microtubule plus end-tracking proteins is highly conserved . the key residues for binding the c-terminal eey/f tail motifs of clip <dig>  eb <dig> proteins, and α-tubulines are f <dig>  w <dig>  k <dig>  n <dig>  and r <dig> . these are almost invariant from stramenopiles to alveolates to humans . in contrast, the residues of the proposed second eb1-binding site a <dig>  l <dig>  t <dig>  k <dig>  and r <dig>  are not conserved . eb <dig> proteins are present in all eukaryotes . thus, this proposed second eb1-binding site could be specific to mammals or, most likely, be an artefact from crystal packing effects. the latter is supported by another crystal structure of the complex of the dynactin cap-gly domain and the c-terminus of eb <dig>  in which only the c-terminal eey motif binds to dynactin1
 <cit> . several mutations in the cap-gly domain of human dynactin <dig> are associated with diseases. the g59s mutation has been identified in patients with distal spinal bulbar muscular atrophy  and the g71r/e/a, t72p, and q74p mutations have been found in patients with perry’s syndrome
 <cit> . all mutations lead to destabilization of the cap-gly domain
 <cit> . the two glycines g <dig> and g <dig> are invariant in all dynactin <dig> cap-gly domains. while the threonine and glutamine are variable across the eukaryotes prolines are never found at these positions .

dynactin2
dynactin <dig> was found in almost all branches of the eukaryotic tree that contain a dynactin complex . the only two species containing a likely functional dynactin complex without dynactin <dig> are the closely related yeasts ogataea parapolymorpha and ogataea angusta. because two different species of ogataea have been sequenced it is unlikely that dynactin <dig> could be missed because of gaps in the assemblies. none of the genomes analysed encodes more than one functional dynactin <dig> gene. some mammals and caenorhabditis brenneri contain dynactin <dig> pseudogenes.

dynactin <dig> from homo sapiens is encoded in  <dig> exons on chromosome  <dig> . two of the exons, the very short exons exon  <dig>  and exon  <dig> , are alternatively spliced. both exons are independently differentially included and many est and cdna clones from many vertebrates exist excluding exons  <dig> and  <dig>  as well as including each exon separately  and both exons together. the two alternatively spliced exons were also found in the agnath petromyzon marinus, but not in any invertebrate and thus seem to be an invention of the most ancient vertebrate. while the up- and downstream coding sequence around exons  <dig> and  <dig> is slightly variable in vertebrates, the sequence of the two short exons is invariant. in contrast to dynactin <dig> we could not identify any further transcription start sites. the analysis of the available est/cdna data do not support alternatively spliced isoforms in any other species than vertebrates.
2a) the scheme shows the gene structure of dynactin <dig>  consisting of  <dig> exons including the differentially included exons  <dig> and  <dig>  b) gene structure of dynactin <dig> . for dynactin <dig>  pseudo-transcripts were identified . c) the dynactin <dig>  gene is comprised of  <dig> exons of which exon  <dig> is alternatively spliced. e) and f) gene structures of dynactin <dig>  and dynactin <dig> , respectively.

the first dynactin <dig> cdna sequences were isolated from rat and human, and consisted of the long form including both alternative exons . although immunobiochemical studies of the dynactin <dig> expression in various adult rat tissues have been interpreted to result from the same transcript
 <cit>  the slightly different sizes of the dynactin <dig> bands in the sds-gels could in retrospect originate from the tissue-specific expression of the alternative splice forms. later, isoform- <dig> and the dynactin <dig> isoform excluding the two alternative exons  have been shown to be tissue specific transcribed
 <cit> , and very recently isoform- <dig> from human has been compared to chicken dynactin2-Δ <dig> with respect to determinants for self-oligomerization and interactions with other dynactin subunits
 <cit> .

the residues encoded by the alternative exons  are located in the n-terminal region of dynactin <dig> but have not been the specific focus of any biochemical study yet. both the n-terminal and the c-terminal part of dynactin <dig> are needed for proper self-assembly and binding to dynactin <dig>  the n-terminal  <dig> residues seem to be required and sufficient for binding to arp1
 <cit> . binding essays showed that determinants for the optimal recruitment of dynactin <dig> are located in the n-terminal half of dynactin <dig> but that the n-terminal  <dig> residues alone are not sufficient
 <cit> . it could thus be possible that a certain combination of alternatively spliced exons in dynactin <dig> correlates with the differentially inclusion of exon  <dig> of dynactin <dig>  more specific experiments will be necessary to reveal how such small modifications of two to five residues could modify dynactin2’s binding to arp <dig>  dynactin <dig>  and dynactin <dig> 

dynactin3
we were not able to identify dynactin <dig> homologs in ustilaginomycetes, chytridiomycota, naegleria gruberi, bigelowiella natans, ciliophora, plants, and stramenopiles . dynactin <dig> homologs could also not be identified in the schizosaccharomyces branch and most of the analysed yeast species. it has been proposed that dynactin <dig> is the least conserved of the dynactin subunits
 <cit> . this analysis has been based on the comparison of the sequence identities of the dynactin subunits of chicken, drosophila, c. elegans, and neurospora crassa to the mouse subunits. in order to determine the least conserved dynactin subunit based on all eukaryotes we calculated sequence identity and similarity matrices for all subunits . because the data includes sequences from all branches of the eukaryotes each subunit shows a broad distribution. the comparison of the medians of the populations shows that dynactin <dig> is the least conserved dynactin subunit followed by dynactin <dig> and dynactin <dig>  because we were able to identify dynactin <dig> in almost all opisthokonts the dynactin <dig> subunits have most likely been lost independently in most saccharomyctes, the basidiomycote ustilago maydis, and in the fungi of the chytridiomycota. similarly we should have been able to find the dynactin <dig> homologs in ciliates based on the dynactin <dig> subunits from the apicomplexa. the other branches, for which we could not find dynactin <dig> homologs, have either lost the gene or the dynactin <dig> proteins must be very different from the known dynactin <dig> subunits. naegleria, bigelowiella, and stramenopiles species normally do not contain intron-rich genes. thus, it is unlikely that we missed dynactin <dig> subunits because they were not present in gene prediction datasets  or because the scores of short exon hits were too low to be detected with tblastn.

dynactin <dig> has been duplicated in rattus norvegicus. the translations of both genes are identical except for three amino acids that are conserved substitutions. however, the gene of homolog b does not contain any introns and is not supported by est data. therefore, it is most likely the result of a recent retro-transcription of a processed pseudogene. human dynactin <dig> is encoded on chromosome  <dig> in  <dig> exons, which are constitutively spliced . a few est clones suggest the alternative transcription of exon  <dig> that, however, leads to pseudo-transcripts . alternatively spliced isoforms have also not been identified in any other species.

dynactin4
dynactin <dig> was found in all branches of the eukaryotic tree that contain dynactin. however, homologs could not be identified in many yeast and most of the schizosaccharomyces species. dynactin <dig> proteins are much longer than dynactin <dig> proteins and we would expect to identify homologs in the yeast and schizosaccharomyces species based on the supposed homology to the identified dynactin <dig> proteins. missing dynactin <dig> genes are therefore rather the result of gene loss than the result of identification problems.

the published dynactin <dig> sequence from neurospora crassa  contains a sequencing error that led to a predicted n-terminal extension of  <dig> residues
 <cit> . the genomic sequence encodes another methionine  <dig> residues upstream of the translation start site. homologous sequence to these  <dig> residues including the methionine could only be found in neurospora species and the closely related sordaria macrospora but not in other sordariales  or any other fungi. the sequence starting from the second methionine is highly conserved in all fungi and thus this methionine is most probably also the translation start site in neurospora and sordaria .

dynactin <dig> from homo sapiens is encoded in  <dig> exons on chromosome  <dig> . exon  <dig>  is a differentially included alternatively spliced exon. different isoforms have already been reported for rat
 <cit>  but not further evaluated. the alternatively spliced exon is conserved in sequence, length, and reading frame in all vertebrates and was also found in the agnath petromyzon marinus, but not in cephalochordates , tunicates , and other invertebrates. the exon invention event therefore predates the separation of the gnathostomata and the hyperoartia. there is not enough est/cdna data available to proof the alternative character of the exon in all vertebrates. for example, there is only one est clone from petromyzon that covers the respective sequence region and includes exon  <dig> but none without exon  <dig>  but because there are est/cdna clones for several fish, mammals, and xenopus with and without exon  <dig> it is highly probable that exon  <dig> is alternatively spliced in all vertebrates. alternatively spliced isoforms have not been identified in any other species.

dynactin <dig> subunits have been predicted to contain n-terminal lim
 <cit>  or ring domains
 <cit> , which are short domains consisting of two zinc fingers of the treble clef fold group arranged in tandem
 <cit> . the treble clef fold is characterised by a β-hairpin at the n-terminus and an α-helix at the c-terminus that both contribute two ligands for zinc binding
 <cit> . in lim domains these ligands are almost exclusively cysteins while cysteins could be replaced by histidines in ring domains. in addition, the tandem treble clef fingers are separated by a two-residue spacer in lim domains, which is invariant in length and seems to be essential for lim-domain function
 <cit> . dynactin <dig> subunits from almost all species contain eight cxxc motifs, of which the seventh and eights motif are separated by about  <dig> residues. the cysteins are never substituted by histidines and a two-residue spacer exists only between the fifth and sixth motif. a multiple sequence alignment based secondary structure prediction using jpred
 <cit>  did not reveal any α-helical propensity close to the cxxc motifs . thus, dynactin <dig> can bind up to four zinc ions but it is unlikely that these zinc fingers adopt the treble clef fold and form lim or ring domains. rather, the cxxc motifs will form so-called zinc ribbons, which are composed of two β-hairpins forming two structurally similar zinc-binding sub-sites. these sites are often separated by even protein domains
 <cit> . thus, as long as structural data is not available it is not possible to predict to which of the other motifs the eighth cxxc motif of dynactin <dig> might fold to build a zinc finger. the highly probable contribution of the eighth motif to the structure of the zinc-finger domain might also explain why expression of only the n-terminal  <dig> residues of dynactin <dig> resulted in aggregates
 <cit> .

dynactin5
dynactin <dig> was found in all eukaryotic branches that contain dynactin, except for species of the schizosaccharomycetes clade and some yeast species of the saccharomyces clade. in the yeast species vanderwaltozyma polyspora, none of the dynactin subunits were identified, except for dynactin <dig> and the capping proteins. vanderwaltozyma also does not encode a cytoplasmic dynein homolog. thus, the vpdynactin <dig> might either be an artefact  or it gained a species-specific function outside the dynactin complex . the absence of dynein and dynactin in vanderwaltozyma is most likely related to the specific phenotypic feature that spores are formed by extra mitotic replications after meiosis independent of bud formation
 <cit> . sole dynactin <dig> subunits have also been found in euglenozoa, and dynactin <dig> additionally in trypanosoma cruzi. euglenozoa also contain cytoplasmic dynein heavy and intermediate chains. the presence of only dyanctin <dig>  is in accordance with the report of a freely soluble pool of these subuntis in cells
 <cit> . in addition, a dynactin <dig> homolog was found for the plant vitis vinifera in the cdna database. this sequence could not be identified in the genome assembly and grouped to a cluster containing parasitic nematodes in the phylogenetic tree  indicating that it is most likely a contamination of the vitis vinifera cdna library. some mammals contain one or more pseudogenes resulting from retro-transcripts.

dynactin <dig> from homo sapiens is encoded in six exons on chromosome  <dig> . the available est and cdna data do not provide evidence for any alternatively spliced exons in human dynactin <dig> as well as dynactin5’s from any species.

it has been reported that the subunits dynactin <dig>  dynactin <dig>  and arp <dig> from mouse, drosophila, and c.elegans have conserved alkaline pis
 <cit> . it has been suggested that one or all may interact electrostatically with negatively charged membrane lipids or other acidic cargoes such as lipid droplets or viral nucleocapsids
 <cit> . recently, dynactin <dig> from neurospora crassa was shown to be required for early endosome interaction
 <cit> . however, drosophila arp <dig> and dynactin <dig> and arp <dig> from c. elegans actually have acidic pis . these contradictions were perplexing and we decided to determine whether potential electrostatic interactions between dynactin subunits and membranes are conserved across the eukaryotes. therefore, we have analysed the distribution of pi values of the pointed-end complex subunits of all species . dynactin <dig>  dynactin <dig>  and arp10/arp <dig> show broad distributions from acidic to alkaline pis. in contrast, almost all dynactin <dig> subunits have alkaline pis suggesting a dynactin <dig> specific interaction within the complex or to other cellular components. the other pointed-end subunits might have conserved functions that are, however, most likely independent from electrostatic interactions.

dynactin6
dynactin <dig> is encoded in all eukaryotic branches, except for aconoidasida , plants, rhizaria, bacillariophyta, saccharomycotina and schizosaccharomycetes. in the euteleostei branch , the dynactin <dig> gene has been duplicated. the dynactin <dig> gene from homo sapiens is located on chromosome  <dig> . it consists of  <dig> exons all of which are constitutively spliced. alternatively spliced isoforms have not been identified in any species.

arp1
the only species encoding dynactin subunits except arp <dig> were the yeast vanderwaltozyma polyspora dsm  <dig>  the stramenopiles aureococcus anophageferens, and the cryptophyte guillardia theta. duplicates have been identified in mammals and anole lizard  grouping to two types, variant a  and variant b . because the fish arp1s are most closely related to variant b while the bird and frog arp1s are most closely related to variant a, the arp <dig> duplication event must have been at the origin of the vertebrates, most probably as part of the two whole genome duplications  that happened at the emergence of the vertebrates
 <cit> . unfortunately, est or genomic dna data is not available for any arp <dig> in petromyzon marinus. therefore, we cannot conclude yet whether the arp <dig> gene duplication happened at the basis of the vertebrates or the gnathostomata. subsequent to the duplication, the ancestors of the fish, birds, and frogs each lost one additional arp <dig> paralog, while the mammals and the anole lizard retained both of them. arp1a and arp1b have both been shown to be part of dynactin and were found in a constant ratio of about 15: <dig> in the cytosolic fraction
 <cit> . there was no evidence for a free pool of either isoform and it could not be resolved whether arp1a and arp1b appear in distinct or mixed complexes. a recent proteomics study of microtubule associated genes in brain tissue also showed that both paralogs are part of the dynactin pool
 <cit> . formally it could be possible that all combinations of the two arp <dig> paralogs are present in dynactin complexes in mammalian cells. however, because the two paralogs are 90% identical  and the few differences are distributed over the length of the arp <dig> molecule and because most vertebrates retained only one arp <dig> homolog it is likely that even mixed dynactin complexes are functionally identical.

arp <dig> 
ten actin-related proteins have been found in the completed genome sequence of saccharomyces cerevisiae, namely arp <dig> to arp10
 <cit> . subsequently, next to arp <dig> a second actin-related protein has been identified in the vertebrate dynactin complex. it has been named arp <dig> although its closest grouping homologs in a phylogenetic tree of actin and actin-related proteins were the yeast arp <dig> and ropy- <dig> from neurospora crassa <cit> . most probably, the support for a potential subfamily grouping was not as significant as for other groups of actin-related proteins. along the same lines a comparative analysis of  <dig> completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes did not reveal compelling evidence for grouping arp <dig> and arp <dig> into one subfamily but recognized that, until then, the appearance of arp <dig> and arp <dig> was mutually exclusive
 <cit> . it has been suggested that both should be grouped together if yeast arp <dig> was found in the dynactin complex or to separate them if both arp <dig> and arp <dig> were found in a single organism
 <cit> . recently, yeast arp <dig> has been shown to be an integral part of the dynactin complex
 <cit> .

arp <dig> and arp <dig> proteins are very divergent, not only in comparison to the other actin-related proteins but also in between the subfamily. in order to determine their presence or absence in species not encoding unambiguous orthologs we assembled all actin related genes of these species for comparison with complete arp repertoires of representative organisms. altogether more than  <dig>  arp proteins have been assembled and analysed including all previously designated arp classes
 <cit> . thus, arp <dig> orthologs have been identified in the metazoa, the fungi , the amoebozoa, and oomycetes branch. arp <dig> orthologs have been identified in almost all species of the saccharomycotina branch. exceptions are zygosaccharomyces rouxii, vanderwaltozyma polyspora, candida glabrata, and lodderomyces elongisporus. both arp <dig> and arp <dig> have been found in a mutually exclusive manner and group together in the phylogenetic tree of all arp proteins . therefore, and because representatives of both have been shown to be present in dynactin, both are orthologs. according to hugo this group should be named arp <dig>  and arp <dig> can be used as synonym
 <cit> . as with the other dynactin genes we will follow the hugo recommendation and use the name arp <dig> for orthologs of this group of actin-related proteins throughout the rest of the analysis. arp <dig> has been duplicated in gallus gallus, and two arp <dig> homologs were identified in the pseudotetraploid xenopus laevis. in the other branches of the eukaryotes, none of the assembled actin-related proteins clearly belongs to the arp <dig> subfamily.

capping proteins capα  and capβ 
the ubiquitous actin capping proteins capα  and capβ  are part of the dynactin complex but except for capping the arp <dig> minifilament they do not seem to have dynactin-specific functions and will therefore be discussed in additional file
 <dig> 

discussion
here, we have performed an exhaustive analysis of all known dynactin subunits in all eukaryotic genomes available until september  <dig>  the presence of dynactin subunits is always coupled to the presence of a cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain . some branches do not contain a dhc <dig> and accordingly do not contain any dynactin subunit : plants, diplomonads , haptophyceae , entamoebidae, some of the microsporidia, and rhodophyta . while the presence of dynactin is coupled to the presence of a dhc <dig> there are a few species that contain cytoplasmic dyneins but do not encode dynactin subunits: piroplasmida , some microsporidia, and parabasalia . the dhc1s of the known piroplasmida and microsporidia are, however, extremely divergent and shortened  and it is not known whether these are functional motors at all. together, these results demonstrate the strong functional interconnection between dynactin and cytoplasmic dynein. in addition, both were most probably already present in the last common ancestor of the eukaryotes. although dynein-independent functions have been reported for dynactin these are most likely sub-functionalisations in specific branches of the eukaryotic tree in which either dyneins partnership became obsolete for certain functions or in which dynactin acquired additional specific binding partners.
 <cit> . the placement of the haptophyceae and cryptophyta to the sar is still highly debated. although several analyses are in favour of this grouping  most analyses are in contrast
 <cit> . at each leaf of the tree one representative species of the branch is printed. branch lengths are arbitrary. the tree illustrates the presence and absence of each subunit of the dynactin complex in the corresponding species under the hypothesis of five eukaryotic supergroups and the position of the leca as indicated. alternative eukaryotic roots are indicated by coloured arrows. coloured boxes show gene duplications and white boxes show gene loss events of dynactin subunits. the presence  or absence  of the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain gene dhc <dig> is indicated for those species that do not have dynactin or miss most of the subunits. b) a possible tree of some major branches of the eukaryotes is shown together with the subunits encoded by the respective taxa. the tree is based on the most parsimonious way the branches could have diverged based on the assumption that during this evolution subunits have only been gained and not lost.

all of dynactins known eleven subunits were already present in the last common ancestor of the eukaryotes because all of them have been identified in at least two of the major lineages . however, in many genomes single subunits are missing. is this due to gene loss events or due to problems in their identification? the dynactin complex and the dynactin subunits have first been identified and characterised in vertebrates and insects, and these constitute the reference sequences. it could be possible, that some subunits have not been identified in several branches and species, which diverged very early in eukaryotic evolution, because of their low similarity to the subunits of the metazoan species that prevented their identification. however, unambiguous homologs have been identified and annotated in every major lineage of the eukaryotes demonstrating that the sequence similarity in general dates back to the last common ancestor. even when we searched with these homologs instead of the reference sequences, missing homologs in closely related species could not be identified. for example, although a dynactin <dig> has been found in tetrahymena we were not able to identify dynactin <dig> homologs in toxoplasma gondii, plasmodium and cryptosporidium species. therefore, we rather assume that subunits have been lost during evolution although we cannot exclude that we might have missed divergent homologs that can only be revealed in experiments, but not sequence based analyses. in addition, subunits might be missing because of gaps in the sequence assemblies.

evolution of the dynactin complex in eukaryotes
the evolution of the dynactin complex in eukaryotes is characterised by many branch- and species-specific gene loss and gene duplication events . the monophyly of the sar branch is well established now
 <cit>  as well as the monophyly of the opisthokonts  and excavata
 <cit> . the last common ancestors of both the sar and the unikonts contained all eleven dynactin subunits . if the unikont-bikont hypothesis, that combines all major kingdoms except the unikonts into a supergroup called bikonts and places the eukaryotic root between these two supergroups
 <cit> , were true the last common ancestor of all extant eukaryotes  must have contained the complete dynactin complex . another hypothesis places the origin of the eukaryotes between plantae and the rest . unfortunately, the genome sequence of the glaucophyte cyanophora paradoxa is not complete, but it seems that based on the latter hypothesis the leca would have contained only dynactin <dig>  dynactin <dig>  dynactin <dig>  dynactin <dig>  and the cap proteins. the dynactin data does not help in resolving the issue of unambiguously placing the eukaryotic root because its analysis involves eleven subunits and is biased by the very small number of sequenced species in the taxa cryptophyta, haptophyta, glaucophyta and excavata except euglenozoa. thus it could be possible that more complete dynactin inventories will be found in newly sequenced species of these taxa like in the sar branch in which all dynactin subunits were found in total but not in a single species. building a parsimonious tree from the presence and absence of the dynactin subunits alone in all species is not possible without breaking established monophyletic groups like the sistergroups fungi and holozoa, or the sistergroups blastocystis and oomycetes. however, if we try to reconstruct a tree of the eukaryotes based on the major taxa by only breaking the still debated phylogenetic groupings of the haptophyta and the diplomonadida but leaving established supergroups intact, the following scenario can be imagined . diplomonadida and haptophyta both do not contain cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin and were therefore the first to diverge in eukaryotic evolution. the leca would have not contained dynein and dynactin in this case. next, the dynactin <dig> and dynactin <dig> subcomplex and dynactin <dig> were invented and the cryptophyta separated. this would be consistent with the finding of a freely soluble pool of dynactin <dig> and dynactin <dig> in cells
 <cit> . the placing of the glaucophyta  is not yet clear due to the incomplete genome of the single representative cyanophora paradoxa. the glaucophyta do have already dynactin <dig> and dynactin <dig> but miss dynactin <dig>  subsequently, arp <dig> and dynactin <dig> evolved completing the arp <dig> rod in heterolobosea . finally, the projecting arm had been completed in sar and opisthokonta. however, this model is based on the assumption that dynactin subunits had only been gained and not lost during early eukaryotic evolution, and the model contradicts the unikont-bikont and the photosynthetic-nonphotosynthetic split hypotheses. given the many dynactin gene loss events in later separating branches it is more likely that the leca already contained all dynactin subunits. this assumption could be combined with both split hypotheses and is in agreement with analyses of other protein complexes in which the reconstructed complexes of the leca contained most of the present-day subunits
 <cit> .

from the stage of the sar and opisthokonta the subsequent evolution of the branches is determined by many and specific gene loss events. especially arp <dig>  dynactin <dig>  dynactin <dig>  and dynactin <dig> have been lost independently in many branches. the arp <dig> filament capping function of arp <dig> might have been taken over by one of the so far unclassified actin-related proteins or dynactin <dig>  dynactin <dig> forms a tight complex with dynactin <dig> in vertebrates
 <cit>  but because also yeasts have, if at all, only dynactin <dig> it might be possible that dynactin <dig> forms a homodimer in the species lacking dynactin <dig>  dynactin <dig> subunits have independently been lost by many species or their dynactin <dig> homologs have lost the cap-gly domain hindering their identification because of the low sequence similarity of the coiled-coil regions. vertebrate and drosophila dynactin <dig> transcripts without a cap-gly domain  are very well versed to bridge the arp <dig> rod to dynein and microtubules showing similar intracellular trafficking of organelles
 <cit> . thus, so far unknown dynactin1s without cap-gly domains could still be present in apicomplexa, heterolobosea and apusozoa. dynactin <dig> is necessary for the incorporation of dynactin <dig> into the yeast dynactin complex
 <cit> . however, it has been shown that dynactin <dig> in vertebrates and drosophila contains an independent arp <dig> binding site, and therefore dynactin <dig> might not be essential for the dynactin complex in all species. this might explain dynactin3’s absence in many branches that have dynactin <dig>  other reasons could be that we were not able to identify all dynactin <dig> subunits because of their low sequence conservation or that dynactin <dig> has diverged in independent branches so far that homology cannot be detected any more. in any case, strong changes happened to this subunit independently in many early branching eukaryotic lineages and also in closely related branches.

expansion of dynactin complexity in metazoa
dynactin complex diversity in metazoa is greatly enhanced by branch specific gene duplications and the introduction of alternative splice forms . the dynactin <dig> gene has been duplicated independently in the nematods of the spirurida branch, in the brachycera including the drosophila species
 <cit> , and in fish genomes . thus, dynactin complexes with different properties could be generated in these species by assembling two different homodimers or a heterodimer of their different dynactin <dig> subunits. dynactin <dig> and arp <dig> have also been duplicated in the otocephala branch  and in birds, respectively. arp <dig> has been duplicated early in vertebrate history and subsequently fish, birds, and amphibians lost different types of the duplicates. an alternative but less likely scenario would be that all dynactin subunit duplications were part of the two whole genome duplications at the origin of the vertebrates followed by numerous independent gene losses in the extant species.

interestingly, alternatively spliced exons have been invented in vertebrate dynactin <dig>  dynactin <dig>  and dynactin <dig> genes either before, in between or after the two whole genome duplication events happened but before the divergence of the agnaths and the gnathostomata . thus, complexity and fine-tuning of dynactin <dig> can considerably be enhanced by differential inclusion of four exons that can be combined with three alternative start sites for translation . the alternative start sites affect the inclusion/exclusion of the cap-gly domain, and three of the alternative exons encode consecutive pieces of the basic region between the cap-gly domain and the first coiled-coil domain. these alternative splice forms therefore do not affect the binding of dynactin to cytoplasmic dynein but only the region attaching dynactin to microtubules
 <cit> . altogether,  <dig> different transcripts can theoretically be generated for each vertebrate dynactin <dig> gene. it is not known yet whether heterodimers of dynactin <dig> isoforms are possible, which would multiply the theoretically possible number of different dynactin complexes. however, it seems unlikely that a transcript with certain functionality, e.g. a transcript without the cap-gly domain, would be combined with a subunit that could in part reconstitute the missing function. this conclusion is consistent with findings in rat brain that showed distinct complexes of dynactin with either full-length dynactin <dig>  or cap-gly diminished dynactin <dig> . the three alternative splice forms analysed so far  also showed a tissue specific expression pattern
 <cit>  demonstrating that most likely only a limited number of different dynactin <dig> subunits and not all possible combinations are present in a single cell. however, all combinations will most likely be present in each organism.

because most subunits are present in multiple copies in the complex, a single gene duplication of one subunit would already result in two, three, or more different complexes, if complexes were built not only from distinct but also mixed subunit compositions. based on their gene content, the vertebrates can theoretically build thousands of different dynactin complexes considering all combinations of the genes and splice forms. however, most of the differences are introduced by tiny changes. for example, all identified alternatively spliced exons contain only between two and seven residues. in addition, the two arp <dig> paralogs differ in only a few residues that are distributed over the length of the molecule. thus, these small changes are not expected to considerably alter the overall structure of dynactin. however, it is well known that even single posttranslational modifications can dramatically change the functions of proteins from activating/deactivating enzymes or binding/non-binding other proteins or membranes . concerning the two arp <dig> paralogs it is hard to imagine how defined combinations could be generated in the cell given that eight to nine arp <dig> subunits comprise the arp <dig> minifilament. this would require a strong regulation of the protein level of both paralogs as well as a strong regulation of the position-specific incorporation into the minifilament. the 15: <dig> ratio of the paralogs could be regulated at the transcription level but it is very likely that both are just randomly incorporated into dynactin without influencing its structure, stability, and function. therefore, dynactins functions will most likely only be modulated through the various alternative transcripts. the differences seem small but have not been studied at a molecular level yet.

reduction of dynactin complexity in yeasts
in general, gene loss in yeasts only affects the pointed-end complex subunits and dynactin <dig>  which mediates association of dynactin <dig> to dynactin <dig>  the schizosaccharomycetes and saccharomycotina both have lost the dynactin <dig> subunit. dynactin <dig> and dynactin <dig> are predicted to fold into left-handed β-helical structures
 <cit> , and are supposed to form a tight heterodimeric complex in vertebrates
 <cit> . they show low sequence similarity but can still be aligned to each other . therefore, it could be possible that dynactin <dig> forms homodimers in those species that do not encode dynactin <dig>  dynactin <dig> and dynactin <dig> have been lost in schizosaccharomycetes and many saccharomycotina subbranches. the loss of dynactin <dig> in yeasts is surprising because it has been found to be essential to recruit dynactin <dig> to the dynactin complex in saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> . the dynactin <dig> genes in yeasts have about the same lengths, which is also true for the dynactin <dig> genes. a missing dynactin <dig> is therefore not compensated by additional domains in the other dynactin subunits. either changes at the surface of dynactin <dig> or dynactin <dig> may supersede dynactin <dig> or we were not able to detect the missing dynactin <dig> subunits yet. dynactin <dig> is required for the interaction of dynein with a subset but not all membranous vesicles, which is supported by the conserved basic pi of all dynactin <dig> subunits and by membrane-flotation essays
 <cit> . this is also consistent with findings in saccharomyces cerevisiae, which does not encode a dynactin <dig> subunit, that dynein is necessary for nuclear migration and spindle orientation but does not perform vesicle transport
 <cit> . in addition, dynactin <dig>  arp <dig>  and dynactin <dig> have been lost in several, two, and  <dig> branch of the yeasts, respectively. arp <dig> is needed for the stability and capping of the arp <dig> filament
 <cit>  and its absence should thus affect dynactins integrity. both zygosaccharomyces and lodderomyces lack arp <dig> and dynactin <dig>  the other pointed-end capping protein and it is unclear how the arp <dig> filament could be stabilized in these species.
 <cit> . small differences are most likely due to the different genes  and methods used . on the left the phylogenetic tree is shown with the corresponding species at each leaf. white boxes at branches represent gene loss events. on the right those subunits of the dynactin complex are tabulated that show differential inclusion within the analysed species. dynactin subunits that are present in all species have been omitted for clarity. the abbreviation ‘n’ denotes the absence of the corresponding subunit in the respective genome while blanks indicate their presence.

CONCLUSIONS
the dynactin complex is a very ancient complex that already existed in the last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes. it consists of eleven subunits of which at least seven comprise the core structure: dynactin <dig>  dynactin <dig>  dynactin <dig>  dynactin <dig>  the heterodimeric capping protein, and arp <dig>  the presence of the dynactin complex coincides with that of the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain: organisms that do not encode cytoplasmic dyneins like plants and diplomonads also do not encode dynactin subunits either. in the metazoan lineage, several of the dynactin subunits were duplicated independently in different branches. the largest repertoire is found in vertebrates. also at the origin of the vertebrates, several alternatively spliced exons have been invented providing the basis for modulating the core functions. the most prominent example is the dynactin <dig> gene, from which  <dig> different transcripts could be generated. in contrast, ascomycetous yeasts have reduced subunit compositions. in general they have reduced pointed-end complexes, which in return let to the loss of the functions coupled to the specific subunits.
