BACKGROUND
growth is an important trait in fish farming and is one of the primary targets in breeding programs aimed at improving productivity  <cit> . growth of fish is governed by multiple genes and is also influenced by various environmental factors  <cit> . several important growth-related genes have been identified in various domesticated vertebrates, including growth hormone , growth hormone receptor , insulin-like growth factor  i and ii, growth hormone-releasing hormone , leptins, growth hormone inhibiting hormone , myostatin , myogenic regulatory factors , and many others  <cit> . however, reports on other growth-related genes in fish are relatively limited. quantitative trait loci  have been successfully used to locate growth-associated genes to particular regions of the fish genome, but identifying individual genes has proved difficult  <cit> . other methods such as compensatory growth experiments proved fruitful for understanding regulatory mechanisms connected with growth in fish  <cit> .

compensatory growth is a period of accelerated growth that follows growth-limiting conditions once non-limiting conditions are renewed  <cit> . characteristic features of compensatory growth include increased food-intake, accelerated mitosis and enhanced rate of food utilization. compensatory growth was first reported a century ago and has been widely studied in vertebrates  <cit> . most animals, especially fish, are capable of compensatory growth  <cit> . however, the regulatory mechanisms and global gene expression patterns of compensatory growth in fish remain poorly understood. expanding knowledge in this area is important for identifying growth-associated genes, increasing the efficiency of feeding and reducing the cost of fish farming.

transcriptome or rna-sequencing  is a technology based on next-generation sequencing that is being successfully applied to transcriptome analysis  <cit> . rna-seq has proved advantageous for characterizing the gene expression profiles of both model and non-model species, despite only being available for a short time  <cit> . moreover, rna-seq has strengthened our understanding of the breadth and depth of eukaryotic transcriptomes. in fish, transcriptome profiles can be mapped and annotated by rna-seq, and numerous biological processes such as development, host immune response, stress response, and adaptive evolution are now better understood due to this technique  <cit> . rna-seq has been applied to zebrafish, channel catfish, european sea bass, rainbow trout, and grass carp  <cit> .

grass carp , an important aquaculture species in china, accounts for more than 18% of total freshwater aquaculture production in this country. production of grass carp reached  <dig>  million tons in  <dig>  which making it the most highly consumed freshwater fish worldwide  <cit> . however, much of our knowledge on grass carp genes is restricted to immunity-related or disease resistance-associated genes, and growth–related genes are not well understood  <cit> . therefore, it is important to explore growth-related genes to inform grass carp breeding programs aimed at improving growth traits. to this end, grass carp were subjected to compensatory growth and transcriptome analysis by rna-seq in this study. global gene expression patterns during compensatory growth were investigated, and some significant differentially expressed genes  were identified and annotated. these results enhance our understanding of the mechanism of compensatory growth in grass carp and will be of benefit to future grass carp breeding programs.

methods
ethical procedures
animal welfare and experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals , and the protocol was approved by the committee of the institute of hydrobiology, chinese academy of sciences . all surgery was performed under eugenol anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.

experimental fish
healthy grass carp at three months old were used in the study. grass carp weighing 2–3 g and an average length of 5 cm were obtained from the guan qiao experimental station, institute of hydrobiology, cas, and acclimatized in aerated fresh water at 26-28°c for one week before processing. fish were fed with commercial feed  twice a day and water was exchanged daily. if no abnormal symptoms were observed, grass carp were selected for further study. fish were divided into control and experimental groups that each included three repeated subgroups. each subgroup contained  <dig> grass carp in a separate tank. five fish were sampled in each repeated subgroups at each time point.

compensatory growth experiment
the compensatory growth experiment was carried out after no abnormal symptom were observed, and lasted for five weeks. at the beginning of the experiment, fish in the two groups were weighed. during the first week, fish in the control group were fed twice a day, whereas no feed was given to the experimental group. after the first week, five fish from each subgroup were weighed and muscle and liver were sampled. these samples were named as c-1-m , c-l-l , e-1-m , and e-1-l . in the second week, fish in both groups were fed twice a day, and fish were weighed and sampled at the end of the second week as described. these were named as c-2-m , c-2-l , e-2-m , and e-2-l . tissue samples from the same subgroups were mixed equivalently for rna isolation. the remaining fish were fed twice a day and weighed every week until the end of the experiment, and weights were subjected to statistical analysis. the specific growth rate  was calculated as described previously  <cit> . briefly, sgr means / × 100), where w <dig> is the weight at the end of the growth interval and w <dig> is the weight at the beginning of the growth interval, while t2-t <dig> represents the duration  of the growing interval. in this study, sgrs were calculated for control and experimental group during the three time intervals: 0 ~ 1 weeks, 1 ~ 2 weeks, and 2 ~ 5 weeks. in addition, an independent repeated experiment was carried out by the similar method that described above. the repeated experiment was lasted for three weeks and samples were used for qpcr analysis.

rna isolation, library construction and sequencing
rna was isolated using trizol reagent  according the manufacturer’s protocol, concentration was measured by the qubit rna assay kit , and integrity was assessed with the rna nano  <dig> assay kit . rna of sufficient quality was used in library construction. sequencing libraries were generated using the nebnext ultra rna library prep kit for illumina  following the manufacturer’s protocol. briefly, mrna was purified from total rna using poly-t oligo-attached magnetic beads and fragmented by nebnext first strand synthesis reaction buffer . first strand cdna was synthesized using a random hexamer primer and m-mulv reverse transcriptase. second strand cdna synthesis was subsequently performed using dna polymerase i and rnase h. after adenylation of the 3’ end of dna fragments, nebnext adaptors with hairpin loop structure were ligated in preparation for hybridization. 3 μl user enzyme  was used with size-selected, adaptor-ligated cdna at 37°c for 15 min followed by 5 min at 95°c prior to pcr using phusion high-fidelity dna polymerase, universal pcr primers and index  primer. finally, pcr products were purified using an ampure xp system and library quality was assessed using an agilent bioanalyzer  <dig> system. libraries were sequenced on an illumina hiseq  <dig> platform and 100 bp single-end reads were generated.

data analysis
raw data reads in fastq format were initially processed using in-house perl scripts. in this step, clean data  were obtained by removing adapter, poly-n and poor quality data. the q <dig>  q <dig>  and gc content of the clean data were calculated, and all downstream analysis was performed the clean high quality data.

clean data were mapped to the grass carp reference genome  using tophat <dig> software  <cit> . two base mismatches were allowed in the mapping process, total mapped reads were calculated, and the mapped regions  were counted.

htseq software was used to count the number of reads mapped to each gene  <cit> , and the reads per kilobase of the exon model per million mapped reads  were calculated for each gene based on the length of the gene and the number of reads mapped to the gene  <cit> .

differential expression analysis
differential expression analysis of two groups/conditions was performed using the deseq package  <cit> . the resulting p-values were adjusted using the benjamini and hochberg’s approach for controlling the false discovery rate. genes with an adjusted p-value < <dig>   found by deseq were assigned as differentially expressed.

gene ontology  enrichment analysis of degs was implemented by the goseq r package  <cit> , in which gene length bias was corrected. go terms with corrected p-values less than  <dig>  were considered significantly enriched by degs.

the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database is used for understanding high-level functional information in biological systems from molecules, cells, organisms and ecosystems, and is particularly powerful for large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental approaches  <cit> . in this study, kobas software was employed to test the statistical enrichment of degs in kegg pathways  <cit> . kegg terms with corrected p-values less than  <dig>  were considered significant.

validation of degs by qpcr
in order to confirm the reliability of data obtained by rna-seq, twelve degs were random selected for validation by qpcr. the primers were listed in additional file  <dig> and the cdna sequences  of these genes were shown in additional file  <dig>  the rna samples from an independent repeated study and were used for reverse transcription. first strand cdnas were obtained using a random hexamer primer and the revertra ace kit . qpcr was carried out in a bio-rad fluorescence quantitative pcr instrument . each qpcr mixture contained  <dig>  μl sense and reverse primers, 1 μl template, 10 μl 2 × sybr mix , and  <dig>  μl ddh2o. three replicates were conducted for each sample and β-actin gene was used as an internal control to normalize. only the primer with efficiency of 90% ~ 110% was used for qpcr. the program for qpcr was as follows: 95°c for 10 s, 40 cycles of 95°c for 5 s and 60°c for 20 s. relative expression level was calculated using the 2-△△ct method  <cit> . all data are given as mean ± standard deviation of three replicates.

RESULTS
changes in body weight and sgr during compensatory growth
the weight of fish in two groups was recorded at six time points and curves were drawn . for the control group, a total increase of  <dig>  g in body weight and a growth rate of  <dig> % was obtained. for the experimental group, a total increase of  <dig>  g in body weight and a growth rate of  <dig> % was acquired. moreover, the sgr in different time intervals was calculated . in the first week, the weight of the experimental group decreased sharply following the induced starvation , indicated by a negative sgr . during the following week of re-feeding, the weight of the experimental group increased rapidly and resulted in a positive of sgr , which is significantly higher than  that in the control group . the elevated sgr that characterizes compensatory growth subsequently declined back to low level during the 2 ~ 5 weeks of realimentation, whereas the sgr of experimental group  was still significantly higher than  that in the control group  .figure  <dig>

preliminary analysis of rna-seq data
at different time points, muscle and liver samples from control and experimental groups were used for library construction. duplicates were performed for each class, therefore  <dig> libraries were constructed in total. these libraries were sequenced using the illumina hiseq.  <dig> platform, and raw reads, clean reads, q <dig>  total mapped reads, and unique mapped reads for each library were recorded . all libraries gave q20 ≥ 95%, total mapped reads ≥89%, and unique mapped reads ≥85%. moreover, the percentage of the total mapped reads that mapped to the genome region was calculated and ≥83% mapped to the exon for all libraries . this confirmed the high quality of the sequencing data and suitability for further analysis. the sequencing data in this study have been deposited in the sequence read archive  at the national center for biotechnology information  .table  <dig>

analysis of gene expression level
the total reads number that mapped to the genome region of each gene was calculated using htseq software, and the expression level of each gene was calculated according to the method of rpkm  <cit> . rpkm intervals and gene numbers in each rpkm interval of all  <dig> libraries are listed in additional file  <dig>  rpkm intervals were similar for duplicate samples. however, rpkm intervals of samples from muscle were different from liver samples. the number of genes with a low rpkm interval  was greater in liver, whereas the number of genes with a high rpkm interval  was greater in muscle. the rpkm of each gene was calculated from the average of all replicates. moreover, the r <dig> value of the pearson product–moment correlation coefficient was ≥ <dig>  for all replicates , which further confirmed the repeatability of the sampling.

identification of degs
from integration of the replicates, the  <dig> libraries were condensed into  <dig> sample groups named c-1-m, c-l-l, e-1-m, e-1-l, c-2-m, c-2-l, e-2-m, and e-2-l. to identify degs, samples were subjected to a series of paired-comparisons. muscle and liver samples from the experimental group that experienced fasting conditions were compared with the appropriate control group . muscle and liver samples from the experimental group following re-feeding were compared with the appropriate control group . in addition, muscle and liver samples from the experimental group following re-feeding were compared with experimental groups following fasting conditions . the number of degs identified from the different paired-comparisons is listed in table  <dig>  in fasting conditions,  <dig> degs were detected in muscle  and  <dig> degs were identified in liver . following re-feeding,  <dig> and  <dig> degs were discovered in muscle  and liver , respectively. moreover, when fasting and re-feeding experimental groups were compared,  <dig> degs were identified in muscle  and  <dig> degs were detected in liver . detailed information of all degs is shown in additional file  <dig>  these degs were subjected to venn diagram analysis , which identified  <dig> genes in both e-1-m/c-1-m and e-1-l/c-1-l ,  <dig> genes in both e-2-m/c-2-m and e-2-l/c-2-l , and  <dig> genes in both e-2-m/e-1-m ande-2-l/e-1-l .table  <dig>

go enrichment analysis
go enrichment analysis was performed to investigate the possible roles of degs. for all six paired-comparisons, annotated genes were categorized into three main categories, namely biological process, molecular function, and cellular component . the biological process category included high representation for genes involved in single-organism metabolic processes, organonitrogen compound metabolism, small molecule metabolism, oxidation-reduction, general metabolic and organic acid metabolic processes. catalytic activity, oxidoreductase activity, cofactor binding, coenzyme binding, and other binding terms were significant enriched in the molecular function category. in the cellular component category, intracellular, myosin complex, extracellular matrix, actin cytoskeleton, and non-membrane-bound organelle terms were abundant. in the comparison of e-2-l/c-2-l, no cellular component term was enriched, and the number of terms for biological process and molecular function was also low. detailed information of enriched terms is listed in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig>

kegg analysis
in order to identify possible biochemical pathways in which degs operate, kegg pathway analysis was carried out for all six paired-comparisons, and significantly enriched pathways are listed in table  <dig>  the most of enriched pathways were metabolism- or biosynthesis-related pathways such as metabolic pathways, carbon metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, citrate cycle , and biosynthesis of amino acids. in addition, some pathways involved in genetic information processing were also enriched, such as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, dna replication, aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis, ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, and rna transport. in all the significant enriched pathways, metabolic pathway was the top category that included the greatest number of annotated genes. in the comparison of e-2-m/c-2-m and e-2-l/c-2-l, fewer pathways were enriched, indicating less degs in these comparisons.table  <dig>

identification of significant degs between experimental and control groups
the more significant degs may play an important role in response to changes in the environment  <cit> , therefore these were identified and annotated. the top five significant degs  are listed in table  <dig>  in fasting conditions, degs exhibited a log2foldchange ≥ <dig> for both up- and down-regulated genes, indicating a significant change in expression level. specifically, calcium-binding and coiled-coil domain-containing protein  <dig> , kelch-like protein  <dig> , methyltransferase-like protein 21c , f-box only protein  <dig> , spry domain-containing socs box protein  <dig> , hepcidin- <dig>  nociceptin receptor, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein   <dig> and  <dig>  and krueppel-like factor  <dig>  were all up-regulated significantly. type- <dig> ice-structuring protein , major facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein 2a  and genes involved in the metabolism of glucose and fatty acids such as group  <dig> secretory phospholipase a <dig> , glucokinase, fatty acid binding protein  <dig> , elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein- <dig> , apolipoprotein a-i, and long-chain-fatty-acid-coa ligase  <dig>  were all down-regulated significantly. following re-feeding, changes in expression level were less pronounced than those under fasting conditions. however, it was apparent that all up-regulated degs were muscle-related , myosin- <dig>  parvalbumin beta, parvalbumin- <dig>  myosin regulatory light chain  <dig> , myosin light chain  <dig> , and troponin c). genes such as lovastatin nonaketide synthase, kelch domain-containing protein  <dig> , ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein  <dig> , kyphoscoliosis peptidase, ankyrin repeat and socs box protein  <dig> , cytosolic phospholipase a <dig> gamma , growth/differentiation factor  <dig> , ankyrin repeat domain- containing protein  <dig> , nuclear receptor coactivator  <dig> , and ferritin  were all down-regulated significantly.table  <dig>

confirmation of degs by qpcr
to confirm the rna-seq data, twelve degs were random selected for qpcr analysis. the rna samples that form an independent repeated study and were used for reverse transcription and qpcr analysis. for each of paired-comparison, two genes were random selected. the random selected degs were macrophage migration inhibitory factor ,peroxiredoxin  <dig> , apolipoprotein eb , elongation factor 1-alpha , apolipoprotein a-i- <dig> , poly  binding protein interacting protein 2b , pleckstrin and sec <dig> domain containing  <dig> , fructose-bisphosphate aldolase b , fructose-bisphosphate aldolase a , complement factor d , eukaryotic translation elongation factor  <dig> alpha 1-like  <dig> , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase . as shown in figure  <dig>  the expression patterns of all twelve degs that obtained by qpcr were similar to that in rna-seq, although the relative expression level was not completely consistent. the results confirmed the reliability and accuracy of the rna-seq data .figure  <dig>

discussion
due to changes in season, variation of temperature, unbalanced food availability, and other growth-stunting conditions, the growth and development of fish can often be restricted. however, when conditions returned to normal, fish can undergo obvious compensatory growth  <cit> . despite numerous reports on compensatory growth in fish  <cit> , the mechanism remains unknown, and global gene expression patterns resulting from compensatory growth are unclear. in order to reveal the mechanism and explore growth-related genes, a compensatory growth experiment was carried out on grass carp and global gene expression patterns were determined using an rna-seq approach. as reported previously, compensatory growth can be classified into four types: over-compensation, full compensation, partial compensation, and no compensation  <cit> . in our study, the total increased weight of the experimental group was  <dig>  g in five weeks, which was more than that in the control group. moreover, the sgr of experimental group was significant higher than that in the control group during the week of re-feeding. a phenomenon of hyperphagia was observed in the experimental group during re-feeding , which is a characteristic of compensatory growth. in addition, the rna-seq data obtained in the study also implied that the compensation growth happened. thus, although the initial body weight of fish in experimental group was slightly lower than that in control group, the results still demonstrated that at least partial compensation occurred.

under fasting conditions,  <dig> and  <dig> degs were identified in muscle and liver, respectively, many of which were involved in metabolic processes, catalytic activity, binding functions, and participated in metabolic and biosynthetic pathways, according to go and kegg annotation results. up- and down-regulation of metabolic and biosynthetic pathways may therefore be a strategy undertaken by grass carp in response to fasting conditions. following re-feeding,  <dig> and  <dig> degs were identified in muscle and liver, respectively. although less than that in under fasting conditions, most degs were up-regulated. these results suggest differences between the experimental group and control groups were reduced after re-feeding, but the differences that were apparent may contribute greatly to the fast increase in body weight observed. in addition, when samples from experimental groups in different conditions were compared,  <dig> and  <dig> degs were identified in muscle and liver, respectively, indicating extensive differences in gene expression between starved and re-feed fish. these degs may be particularly important for compensatory growth in grass carp.

the more significant degs that showed the largest changes in expression level were annotated. under starvation, most of the significant down-regulated genes were involved in the metabolism of glucose and fatty acids   <cit> . mfsd2a and afp <dig> are known to be important for growth and development  <cit> , and down-regulation of these genes indicates that metabolism of glucose and fatty acids is decreased sharply during fasting conditions, which prevented growth and was consistent with the observed reduced weight under these conditions. of the significant up-regulated genes, calcoco <dig>  klh <dig>  fbox <dig>  spsb <dig>  and mettl21c are associated with modification, ubiquitination, or degradation of proteins  <cit> , whereas the nociceptin receptor plays an important role in response to stimulation  <cit> . up-regulation of these genes suggests muscle proteins may be used as the major energy source to maintain basic metabolism in response to fasting, which may also contribute to the decreased weight. in addition, two insulin-like growth factor binding proteins, igfbp- <dig> and  <dig>  were down-regulated significantly. igfbps are reported to bind to insulin-like growth factors , which prevents binding between igfs and their cognate receptors, thereby inhibiting the activities of igfs  <cit> . thus, significant up-regulated of igfbp- <dig> and  <dig> may be another reason for the decreased weight of fish under fasting conditions.

after re-feeding, the most significantly up-regulated genes were myosin-related, such as myl, myosin- <dig>  parvalbumin beta, parvalbumin- <dig>  myl- <dig>  myl- <dig>  and troponin c  <cit> . this strongly indicates that biosynthesis of myosin or muscle occurred, which resulted in increased weight following re-feeding. of the significantly down-regulated genes, lovastatin nonaketide synthase is known to participate in the methylation of proteins  <cit> . klhdc- <dig>  ankrd- <dig>  ankrd- <dig>  and asb- <dig> are also related to the ubiquitination or degradation of proteins  <cit> , and kyphoscoliosis peptidase hydrolyzes muscle-specific proteins  <cit> . gdf- <dig> is associated with appetite, and high expression level of gdf- <dig> may reduce appetite and weight in mice  <cit> . ferritin  is a protein involved in response to cellular emergencies  <cit> . down-regulation of these genes suggests that following re-feeding, fish exit from the emergency response, and the presence of food stimulates appetite. subsequently, muscle proteins are no longer used as the major energy source, and rapid compensatory growth occurred.

significant degs in experimental group between fasting and re-feeding conditions were also identified. pla2g <dig>  elovl- <dig>  elovl- <dig>  and acsl- <dig>  involved in the metabolism of glucose and fatty acids and identified above, were all significantly up-regulated. actin, gatm, and myl encode muscle-related proteins  <cit> , and afp <dig> and zfyve <dig> are important for growth and development  <cit> . up-regulation of these genes indicates stimulation of glucose and fatty acid metabolism, and enhanced biosynthesis of muscle, which may explain the increased body weight. of the significantly down-regulated genes, calcoco <dig> and spsb <dig>  associated with the ubiquitination and degradation of proteins and identified above, were down-regulated. ahsg is able to make mice insensitive to insulin, and inhibits growth  <cit> . dusp <dig> encodes a protein that catalyzes the hydrolysis of amino acids  <cit> , while ho is important in the response to cellular emergencies  <cit> . slco1c <dig> encodes a receptor that mediates uptake of thyroid hormones  <cit>  and socs <dig> negatively regulates growth hormone and igfs  <cit> . down-regulation of these genes indicates that muscle proteins are no longer used as the major energy source following re-feeding. in addition, growth hormone and igfs may be positively regulated, which may accelerate the growth and development of grass carp.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, grass carp were subjected to compensatory growth and global gene expression patterns were determined by rna-seq. numerous degs were identified and several significant degs were annotated. this study expands our understanding of the mechanism of compensatory growth, and will provide a reference for growth-related genes in grass carp.
