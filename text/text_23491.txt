BACKGROUND
recognition of pain-related behaviours in animals is difficult due to inter-species and individual variation  <cit> , yet it is universally acknowledged that improvements in pain assessment may facilitate diagnosis and analgesic treatment in horses. previous studies have developed scales to assess equine orthopaedic  <cit>  and abdominal pain  <cit> . however, to our knowledge, there are no published studies investigating pain scales in horses undergoing soft tissue surgery or experiencing pain of a similar intensity to that associated with castration.

there are established psychometric methods for developing and refining structured questionnaires of abstract constructs such as acute pain in humans. this approach can be adopted for similar purposes in animals. initially the items to be assessed must be collected and refined for inclusion in the questionnaire. thereafter the scale must be scrutinized for both content and face validity and finally the scale must undergo reliability testing  <cit> . furthermore the instrument should be responsive and be able to measure changes as a result of an intervention such as a painful event, or analgesic administration  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to refine and validate a new acute pain scale for the assessment of mild or moderate pain in horses, and to evaluate its reliability.

RESULTS
the ga group included four geldings and two mares ; the gaa group included three geldings and three mares ; the gc group comprised of six male horses  and gca also included six male horses . surgery and anaesthesia lasted approximately 45 minutes in all cases. complete data were obtained from twenty horses. four horses had missing data points; one horse  at t <dig> and t <dig> and one horse  at t <dig> due to abdominal discomfort, which recovered after clinical treatment, one horse  at t <dig>  due to technical problems with the camera and one horse  at t <dig>  due to postoperative haemorrhage.

content validity of the items included in the scale are shown in table  <dig>  the score for each item, the relevance, specificity and item-total correlation are shown in table  <dig>  a refined pain scale was produced after exclusion of the categories that did not show at least one item with adequate relevance and specificity. heart rate was the only physiological variable retained in the pain scale, as it was the only one that differed over time . comparison of the total scores between groups and at the different assessment time points was performed to confirm construct validity. at t <dig>  pain scores were greater in gc than in the other groups, and greater in gca than in gaa. even after the administration of analgesics at t <dig>  gc scores were still greater than ga and gaa, and gca scores were greater than in gaa. at the 24-hour time point  the scores of gc and gca were still greater than those horses in gaa. there were no differences with time in scores for ga and gaa. in gc the scores at t <dig> were greater than at t <dig> and both were greater than tc  and t <dig>  the scores of gca were greater in t <dig> than tc and t <dig> table  <dig>

1the specificity of each item was evaluated by investigating if that particular behaviour was present or not at tc, moment without pain, in all observations from all evaluators, in all animals from all groups. specificity was classified as excellent , good , moderate , or nonspecific .


2relevance was tested based on the possibility of distinguishing the behaviour in t <dig> in gc compared to the other groups. the item was considered relevant when that item differentiated gc from the other three groups, or when gc was different from animals without pain . the item was considered irrelevant when there were no differences between gc and the other groups. asterisks  indicate differences between groups.

results of the criterion validation of the scores assigned to each item of the scale , showed moderate to excellent variability for “positioning in the stall”, “appetite for hay” and “response to palpation of the groin”. with the exception of one evaluator, reliability for the item “locomotion” ranged from moderate to excellent. the horses’ response to opening the door and head movements showed moderate variability. “appetite for concentrate/pelleted feed,” “looking at the flank”, “raising the hind limbs” and “tail movements” showed poor to moderate variability. variability was also poor for the remaining items or otherwise the number of observations was low and therefore it was not possible to perform statistical analysis.

results of the criterion validation investigated by item-total correlation are presented in table  <dig>  the convergent validity was confirmed by positive correlation between the refined scale and the numerical , visual analogue  and simple descriptive scales ,  which were also assessed  <cit> .figure  <dig>

the reproducibility of each item, defined by the ability to obtain the same results in repeated assessments by different evaluators  <cit> , was evaluated by measurement of inter-observer reliability and data are shown in table  <dig> 

the repeatability of each item, investigated by intra-observer reliability, was moderate to excellent for “positioning in the stall” and “kicking at the abdomen”, but ranged from poor to moderate for interactive behaviour, “lifting of hind limbs” and “penis protrusion”. it was also moderate for “locomotion when the horse was led by the evaluator”, “response to palpation” of the painful area , “response to an auditory stimulus”, “pawing at the floor” and “moving the tail”.

there was no difference between groups in physiological parameters, except at time point t <dig> when heart rate was lower in ga than in gca . heart rate was higher in gc and gca at t <dig> and t <dig> compared to the other assessment time points. item-total correlation was moderate for all physiological data.

discussion
the pain scale demonstrated construct and content validity; however intra- and inter-observer reliability for the items were only satisfactory, suggesting that refinement and readjustment of the items was required.

construct validity was demonstrated by the observed differences in scores between the groups at t <dig>  <cit> . the differences between gc, ga and gaa show that the scale is able to differentiate between horses with and without pain. furthermore, in view of the fact that pain scores were different between gc and gca, the scale was also able to identify different pain intensities. the ability of the scale to measure pain was confirmed by its responsiveness, seen in the change in gc scores between t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  <cit> , and by the percentage change in pain scores after surgery and in response to analgesic administration  <cit> .

in both groups that did not undergo surgery  male and female horses were included, which may have been a limitation of the study; since the scale was based on assessment of behaviour, sex differences in behaviour may produce differences in scores between groups at tc. however, this did not occur and scores in the different sexes were similar. the absence of a difference between groups before surgery and/or anaesthesia provides an alternative means to confirm construct validity of the pain scale. response to stress may mimic pain behaviour, and since it might be predicted that stallions would be more agitated prior to surgery, the lack of a difference between treatment groups in baseline scores shows that the construct validity of the scale was not compromised  <cit> .

another aspect that may have confused the interpretation of pain behaviours, especially in relation to assessments requiring the evaluator to interact with the horse, was the time allowed for each horse to acclimatise to the stable, and to the investigator who interacted with the horses. variability in the degree of this initial interaction between each horse and the investigator was expected. however, in order to limit this, one of the inclusion criteria for the study was that the horse must be halter trained and used to interacting with people.

another limitation of the study is that the pain model used here  probably results in only mild to moderate pain. therefore the scale should also be tested under conditions considered to cause more severe pain and be validated under these circumstances as well.

to date there are no validated pain scales that measure mild to moderate soft tissue pain in horses and so criterion validity was evaluated by the contrast in variability between the standard evaluator and the other evaluators  <cit> . the total scores from the pain scale were correlated with three other classical scales used to measure clinical pain in animals and a strong positive correlation was evident  <cit> . although these scales are also not validated, they are frequently used to evaluate pain  <cit>  and lameness in horses  <cit> . correlation with such classical scales has also been used previously to validate pain scales in horses for measurement of visceral pain  <cit> .

the discrepancy in variability between the evaluators and the standard evaluator for each item of the scale suggests poor criterion validity. however, another possible explanation would be the limited training of the evaluators, combined with the complexity and large number of items that comprise the scale. the blinded evaluators were chosen because of their experience in pain-related studies in numerous other species, including horses. furthermore, the item-total correlation, which denotes the importance of each item, showed that most provided moderate correlation. hence the very large number of items evaluated within the initial scale is likely to have reduced the overall criterion validity.

the variation in intra and inter-observer reliability for each item on the scale may suggest a low reliability of the proposed instrument under study. however, the process of pain scale validation does not occur in one step but is iterative, so after excluding items showing no specificity and relevance, the instrument should be re-evaluated using the same validity criteria  <cit> . the poor reproducibility for some items, such as “response to approach” and “presence of the observer”, may be related to failure of observation, due to the difficulty in observing the videos, a fact that might be resolved when observations are performed in situ. otherwise the presence of the observer may also modify the animals’ behaviour.

the scale items that gave the best relevance, specificity and total-item correlation results were retained in the scale after the refinement. however, despite the lack of relevance and low inter-observer reliability, the behaviour “kicking the abdomen” was retained in the scale as this is considered to be a classical abdominal pain related behaviour  <cit> . although the inclusion of physiological parameters is questioned by some authors  <cit> , these items are usually included in tools to assess acute pain in horses  <cit> , as well as in other species  <cit>  and provide a multidimensional character to the scale. heart rate was retained after refinement as this was the only parameter that varied with time, it is easy to evaluate and has historical importance in the assessment of pain  <cit> . in view of the fact that heart rate increased above 25% of pre-operative values  in animals undergoing surgery  at t <dig> and t <dig>  overall changes in heart rate above 25% were considered relevant as an indicator of post-operative pain and were therefore included.

as noted in a study that described the behaviours of horses undergoing arthroscopic surgery and laparotomy  <cit> , horses without pain were more likely to position themselves at the front of the stable compared to other positions in the box. behaviours such as “head position” and “response to auditory stimuli” were excluded due to their variability and since they might be unduly influenced by environmental stimuli.

behaviours related to the interaction with the observer showed similar relevance and specificity to those reported when using an orthopaedic pain scale  <cit>  and similar item-total correlation to animals undergoing laparotomy  <cit> . however this behaviour may also be influenced by the type of management with which the animal is familiar  <cit> . in our study, locomotion was also useful to detect pain after soft tissue surgery, as animals in pain tend to be reluctant to move, reflecting the findings of altered locomotion in horses after orthopaedic surgery  <cit> . however this contrasts with results from other studies in which increased locomotion was associated with pain  <cit> , indicating that it is the change in locomotion that is a useful characteristic to evaluate during pain assessment in horses.

although palpation of the surgical site showed low item-total correlation in this study, specificity ranged from moderate to good and this item was relevant. in a previous study, horses undergoing laparotomy showed a high incidence of avoidance responses  <cit> . in our study, the reaction response was probably related to the inflammation caused by surgical incision. however, it is common for horses not to tolerate palpation of the inguinal area. furthermore, in those cases where this behaviour was evaluated on the video, there may have been misinterpretation. although the two cameras were placed in diagonally opposite positions in the stable to try to avoid blind spots, it was difficult to observe the animal when it was positioned close to the wall directly beneath one of the cameras. under some of these circumstances it was not possible to visualize the pelvic limbs during palpation of the groin.

this is the first study to identify the behaviour of lifting the pelvic limb as a pain-related behaviour in the horse, indicated by the relevance and moderate specificity and item-total correlation. this item was included in the scale after validation of content and before construct validation because it was a behaviour observed by the evaluator in situ during assessment of the gc group.

since there is now a considerable body of work describing the development of tools for pain assessment, it was possible to evaluate the relevance, specificity and reliability of various pain behaviours previously described as relevant in horses. the low repeatability and reproducibility of some behaviours may indicate that their interpretation is influenced by the experience of the evaluator, and therefore they are imprecise. although the reliability of the total score of the refined scale was not investigated, the sensitive and specific items of the behaviours and categories may be used to compose a refined scale for future validation, ideally under clinical conditions.

it should also be noted that during the initial part of the scale, the observer was not present in the box. i it is therefore difficult to accurately ascertain how much the evaluator's presence might interfere with the pain assessment. consequently, whenever possible horses should be observed using a remote monitoring system. although the time necessary for pain assessment has not been determined, after 700 hours of video analysis, we empirically suggest a time frame of 5 minutes would be sufficient for observation of pain-related relevant behaviours in the horse.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this is, to our knowledge, the first study to refine and validate a pain scale for assessing acute, mild clinical pain in horses undergoing castration. the proposed new scale showed construct validity and responsiveness, and differentiated between horses with and without pain as reported previously in horses undergoing moderate and severe pain intensity, like orthopaedic and abdominal pain. reliability of the initial items included in the scale was variable, suggesting the need for refinement of the scale; this led to selection of items that showed relevance, specificity, and item-total correlation. refinement of the scale, and exclusion of items that did not meet the predefined validity requirements, provided a simple version for evaluation of postoperative pain after soft tissue surgery in horses that may be further tested under clinical and experimental conditions.
