BACKGROUND
vibrio parahaemolyticus is a human pathogen that has been associated with gastroenteritis worldwide , and outbreaks have been reported in many countries such as the usa, france, and new zealand . moreover, in recent years, v. parahaemolyticus has been reported as a significant cause of foodborne bacterial poisoning in china  <cit> .

v. parahaemolyticus has been isolated from samples of a variety of aquatic products, including fish, shrimp, oyster, and clam  <cit> , and it is among the most common causative agents of aquatic product-associated gastroenteritis in the world . with the vigorous development of the chinese economy, there has been a rapid increase in aquatic product consumption, not only along the coast of china, but also in mainland china. v. parahaemolyticus distribution in shellfish from the eastern coast of china has been reported previously  <cit> . our previous studies have also shown that shrimp in chinese retail markets are contaminated with v. parahaemolyticus  <cit> . however, to date, the presence of v. parahaemolyticus in retail aquatic products in north china has received less attention, and little information is available on the prevalence and contamination levels of v. parahaemolyticus in such aquatic products. although v. parahaemolyticus is frequently present in aquatic products, most strains of this species are nonpathogenic to humans  <cit> ; however, virulent v. parahaemolyticus strains are clearly a concern for aquatic product safety.

detection of pathogenic v. parahaemolyticus isolates is typically based on molecular biological analysis that amplify tdh and trh sequences  <cit> . these  <dig> genes, encoding the thermostable direct hemolysin  and the homologous thermostable direct hemolysin-related hemolysin , respectively, have been implicated in v. parahaemolyticus virulence . however, a recent study showed that pathogenesis of v. parahaemolyticus does not appear to rely solely on a given virulence function; rather, virulence is a complex trait and different strains may employ somewhat different strategies  <cit> .

to date, on the basis of somatic  and capsular  antigens, v. parahaemolyticus is classified into  <dig> o-serogroups and 71 k-serogroups  <cit> . serotyping has been widely used for identifying isolates in epidemiological studies. furthermore, certain v. parahaemolyticus serotypes have been considered to be more virulent than others  <cit> . a multiplex pcr-based o-antigen serotyping method for v. parahaemolyticus has been successfully developed  <cit> . therefore, pcr-based serotyping is considered a convenient method for the rapid and accurate identification of a wide array of v. parahaemolyticus isolates. however, serotyping offers limited information about the genetic relatedness of strains.

in addition to serotyping, a variety of molecular typing methods have been applied to characterization of v. parahaemolyticus. molecular typing of v. parahaemolyticus was shown to be a useful tool for providing information about the genetic relatedness of strains and for detection of virulent strains  <cit> . in recent years, a number of typing methods such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis   <cit> , ribotyping  <cit> , random amplified polymorphic dna  analysis  <cit> , multi-locus sequence typing   <cit> , and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction   <cit>  have been applied in the typing of v. parahaemolyticus. eric-pcr has previously proven useful for subtyping v. parahaemolyticus  <cit> , and has been successfully used for genotyping different bacterial pathogens in previous studies .

antimicrobials are commonly used in the treatment of infectious diseases in the aquaculture industry; however, the extensive use of antimicrobials has led to the development of antimicrobial resistance among pathogens in aquatic products and has rendered many known antimicrobials ineffective. v. parahaemolyticus has been reported to have resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin . antimicrobial resistance, particularly multi-drug resistance, is among the most important public health concerns because it is directly related to disease management and control  <cit> . therefore, it is necessary to establish a monitoring system for the objective evaluation of the antimicrobial-resistance profile.

therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the seasonal prevalence and levels of v. parahaemolyticus in retail aquatic products in north china. the virulence, serological types, and eric types were focused on, and the antibiotic resistance patterns of the isolated strains were determined.

antimicrobial susceptibility
isolates of v. parahaemolyticus were tested for different levels of antibiotic resistance. the isolates were most resistant to streptomycin, with resistance and intermediate rates of  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively. in addition, the isolates exhibited relatively high resistance rates, of  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  %, for ampicillin, cefazolin, cephalothin, and kanamycin, respectively. however, it was surprising to note that strain  <dig>  isolated from a fish sample, was a multi-drug-resistant strain, which showed resistance to  <dig> antibiotics: streptomycin, cephalothin, ampicillin, tetracycline, kanamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and cefazolin. all of the examined isolates were susceptible to azithromycin and chloramphenicol. among the remaining tested antibiotics, the next-highest susceptibility rates were observed for nalidixic acid , ciprofloxacin , tetracycline , trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole , and gentamicin . the susceptibility, intermediate resistance, and resistance rates of the  <dig> examined v. parahaemolyticus isolates with respect to  <dig> antibiotics are shown in table  <dig> and additional file 4: table s <dig> table  <dig> antimicrobial resistance profiles of  <dig> vibrio parahaemolyticus isolates from north china

discussion
in this study, we analyzed  <dig> aquatic product samples and detected v. parahaemolyticus contamination in  <dig> samples. thus, the overall prevalence of v. parahaemolyticus in aquatic product samples was determined to be  <dig>  %, which was in accordance with the results reported in a study from france  <cit>  and in our previous study  <cit> . notably, the prevalence of v. parahaemolyticus in summer  was higher than that in winter , and the levels of v. parahaemolyticus in the summer were significantly different from those in the winter. these results may be related to the differences in the average temperature of the two seasons. these observations were in agreement with the results of previous studies that showed a seasonal variation in the occurrence of this pathogen . these results, which also confirm the conclusions of the who risk assessment for v. parahaemolyticus  <cit> , can be useful for defining efficient monitoring programs in harvesting areas, based on temperature values for control of v. parahaemolyticus.

as the presence of tdh- and/or trh-positive v. parahaemolyticus strains in aquatic products represents a public health risk, their detection would be of paramount importance. in the present study, tdh- and/or trh-positive v. parahaemolyticus strains were not detected in any of the aquatic product samples. this finding is consistent with the findings of a previous study reported in india  <cit> . however, it is in contrast to the findings of other previous studies  <cit> . the occurrence rate of these genes in pathogenic v. parahaemolyticus isolates is high, as has been proven for clinical isolates. isolates obtained from the environment and food contain much less tdh or trh than clinical isolates  <cit> . however, it has also been shown recently that some clinical v. parahaemolyticus isolates do not possess tdh and trh. even in the absence of these two hemolysins, v. parahaemolyticus remains pathogenic, indicating the existence of other virulence factors  <cit> .

as mentioned above,  <dig> o-serogroups and 71 k-serogroups have been identified in v. parahaemolyticus. the pathogenicity of v. parahaemolyticus strains varies and is associated with the serotype. recently, a multiplex pcr-based o-antigen serotyping method was developed for detection and identification of v. parahaemolyticus  <cit> . this assay can effectively distinguish all v. parahaemolyticus o-serogroups, except o <dig> and o <dig>  in the present study, nine o-serogroups were detected among the isolates. our data indicated that serovar o <dig> was the predominant serotype among the strains isolated from the aquatic product samples, a finding that was in agreement with that of a study previously conducted by our group  <cit> . however, our findings were in disagreement with those of a previous study that identified the o <dig> serotype as the predominant serotype from shellfish from the eastern coast of china  <cit> . previous study demonstrated that most v. parahaemolyticus outbreaks were caused by multiserovars of strains, mainly including o3:k <dig>  o1:kut, and o4:k <dig>  <cit> . o3:k <dig>  o1:kut, o4:k <dig>  and o2:k <dig> were also the dominant serovars of v. parahaemolyticus, that caused outbreaks in china  <cit> . the relationship of serotype between the food poisoning isolates and the aquatic food isolates are of concern.

recently, highly discriminatory molecular typing methods such as pfge and eric-pcr have been developed for differentiation of pathogenic bacteria. eric-pcr is a relatively simple, cost-effective method. it is easier to perform than pfge and is very useful for the analysis of large numbers of strains  <cit> . using this approach in this study, the isolates were classified into  <dig> clusters, at 66 % similarity. this result is similar to those of other studies, confirming the genetic diversity within v. parahaemolyticus strains . some v. parahaemolyticus isolates were of the same types as the clinical strains and a reference strain, which may indicate that these strains are genetically related.

susceptibility tests revealed that the isolates were resistant to some antibiotics. the highest resistance rate  was observed for streptomycin, followed by ampicillin , cefazolin , cephalothin , and kanamycin . similarly, previous studies have shown that the occurrence of streptomycin- and ampicillin-resistance in v. parahaemolyticus isolates is common  <cit> . in the present study, a small number of isolates showed resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, and tetracycline, while none of the isolates demonstrated resistance to azithromycin, indicating that these antimicrobials were still highly effective against v. parahaemolyticus isolates. based on our findings, these antibiotics could be prescribed by doctors for the treatments of v. parahaemolyticus. in our study, half of the isolates were resistant to more than three antibiotics. increasingly, resistant strains are being reported  <cit> , which may be explained as follow: on one hand, along with the steady expansion of the asian aquaculture industry, aquaculture farmers use many different antibiotics to prevent  and treat  pathogenic bacterial infections in aquatic produce  <cit> . on the other hand, a wide range of antibiotics used in humans contaminate water, leading to resistance in pathogenic bacteria. in general, infection emergence of microbial resistance to multiple drugs is a serious clinical problem and can lead to an increase in fatality rates  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that the levels of v. parahaemolyticus in retail aquatic products were relatively low and that none of the isolates possessed tdh and trh. furthermore, serotype o <dig> was found to be the most prevalent; the isolates showed genetic diversity, as determined by eric-pcr typing, and the antimicrobial-resistance patterns showed that most of the isolates were resistant to streptomycin . the findings provided in this study may be useful in defining appropriate monitoring programs, understanding of the dissemination of antibiotic-resistant strains, and providing information for the assessment of exposure to this microorganism at the consumption level.
