BACKGROUND
alternative splicing  is crucial for proteome diversity and functional complexity in higher organisms  <cit> . as events can be detected by aligning mrna sequences to the genome sequence, and expressed sequence tags  have been widely used in as detection. for example, using ests, the as ratio has been estimated to be 53% of the multiexonic genes in humans and mice and 19% in fruit flies  <cit> . the application of high-throughput sequencing technologies to whole transcriptome sequencing  prompts our understanding of as. for example, rna-seq revealed that the ratio of multiexonic genes undergoing as is over 95% in humans  <cit> ,  <dig> % in rice  <cit> , and 61% in arabidopsis  <cit> .

compared with higher organisms, a much lower as ratio has been observed in fungi. based on ests, the as ratio was estimated to be  <dig> % in magnaporth grisea  <cit> ,  <dig> % in ustilago maydis  <cit>  and  <dig> % in cryptococcus neoformans  <cit> . an rna-seq study based on the illumina solexa platform discovered that  <dig> % of the total genes  are alternatively spliced in the fungus aspergillus oryzae  <cit> . there are several comparative studies of as events in multiple species  <cit> . a recent study of  <dig> fungal species observed that a greater fraction of fungal genes than previously estimated were affected by as  <cit> . they estimated that an average of  <dig> % annotated genes are affected by as, and c. neoformans has an extraordinary rate of 18%  <cit> . however, compared with higher organisms, our understanding of as events in fungi is very limited.

trichoderma spp. are free-living fungi that are highly interactive in root, soil, and foliar environments  <cit> . they produce a wide range of antibiotic substances, including cell wall degrading enzymes and peptaibols, and parasitize other fungi. some trichoderma species, e.g., trichoderma atroviride  and trichoderma virens , are used as biocontrol reagents  <cit> . trichoderma reesei  is the main industrial source of cellulases and hemicellulases  <cit> . the genomes of tr, ta, and tv have been sequenced, providing invaluable resources for the study of trichoderma metabolism. comparative transcriptomic studies have been performed to gain insights into the metabolism and mycoparasitism of trichoderma spp.  <cit> . however, splice junctions and alternative splicing events in trichoderma have not been studied.

recently, we sequenced the genome of trichoderma longibrachiatum , which has the smallest genome  among the sequenced trichoderma species  <cit> . in this study, the tl transcriptome was deep sequenced using illumina solexa technology. comparative transcriptomics for two growth media were performed, and the transcription levels for carbohydrate-active enzymes and other genes were evaluated and compared to gain insights into transcriptional regulation. furthermore, comprehensive analyses of splice junctions  and as events were conducted. this study revealed an unexpectedly high ratio of as in tl, which is much higher than that observed in the fungus a. oryzae and is comparable with those observed in humans and plants. this study provides new insights into the as landscape in fungi as well as trichoderma physiology.

RESULTS
t. longibrachiatum transcriptome sequencing
efforts have been undertaken to discover additional transcribed genes and thus to discover additional sjs and as events. initially, tl was cultured in two growth media, the nutrition-rich potato dextrose broth  and the nutrition-scarce mineral salt medium . in addition to the mineral salts included in msm, fungal cell wall, laminarin, cellobiose, and xylan were also included to induce carbohydrate-active enzymes. the fungal cell wall contains chitin and β- <dig>  and β- <dig> -glucan  <cit>  and therefore can induce the expression of chitinases, β- <dig> -glucanases, and β- <dig> -glucanases. laminarin, composed of β- <dig> - and β- <dig> -glucan, can also induce the production of β- <dig> -glucanases and β- <dig> -glucanases. cellobiose can induce the expression of cellulases. xylan can induce the expression of hemicellulases. secondly, for each medium, the fungal mycelia were collected at 40 hours and at 72 hours, and equal amounts of the 40-hour rna sample and the 72-hour rna sample were mixed to prepare a 200-bp paired-end library. lastly, each 200-bp library was deeply sequenced. the pdb library produced ~ <dig> mbp of clean data , and the msm library produced ~ <dig> mbp of clean data . collectively, the two libraries produced a total of ~ <dig>  gbp of clean data, representing ~80-fold of the tl genome .

rna-seq reads were mapped to the tl genome using tophat  <cit> . as a result,  <dig> % of the pdb reads and  <dig> % of the msm reads could be mapped to the tl genome  with a proper interval between the paired-end reads. the mapped pdb reads were assembled into  <dig> pdb transcript units . the mapped msm reads were assembled into  <dig> msm transcript units . by pooling the pdb reads and msm reads, we obtained a total of  <dig> pdb + msm transcript units, which account for over half  of the total tl genome .figure  <dig>

new gene models based on rna-seq
in a previous study, a total of  <dig> gene models  were predicted based on a combination of gene predictors  <cit> . comparison of pdb + msm transcript units with the fggw models revealed  <dig> pdb + msm transcript units that were not included in the fggw models and most likely represent new genes . all the mapped rna-seq reads were assembled into  <dig> rnaseq models . comparison of the models revealed  <dig> protein-coding rnaseq models that did not overlap with the fggw models, trna models or rrna models. the length of these gene models was relatively short . blastp searches revealed that only  <dig> proteins have close relatives  in the swissprot database and  <dig> proteins have close relatives  in the ncbi nr database , suggesting that the majority of these newly found rna-seq-based gene models represent possible new genes for trichoderma. a previous study revealed that the tl genome encodes  <dig> glycoside hydrolases,  <dig> glycosyltransferases,  <dig> carbohydrate esterases, and four polysaccharide lyases  <cit> . in this study, annotation of these new rna-seq genes revealed two additional glycoside hydrolases, including smf2rna_ <dig>  and smf2rna_ <dig> .

comparison of gene transcription levels in two growth media
the expression level of each gene, measured as the numbers of fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped, fpkm, was calculated using cufflinks  <cit> . comparative analyses revealed large differences in global gene transcription for the two growth media . in pdb,  <dig> genes  were transcribed . fewer genes  were transcribed in msm . a total of  <dig> genes  were transcribed in both media. among these genes,  <dig> genes  had transcription levels increased by  <dig> to 400-fold in msm compared with pdb. additionally, among these genes,  <dig> genes  had transcription levels that were decreased by  <dig> to  <dig> -fold in msm compared with pdb.figure  <dig>

carbohydrate-active enzymes are important in the degradation of biomass and attack of plant fungal pathogens by trichoderma spp. in this study, two growth media were used, and the transcription of all carbohydrate-active enzymes was also analyzed. as shown in figure 2b, more glycoside hydrolase genes were transcribed in msm  versus pdb . combining both media,  <dig> glycoside hydrolase genes were transcribed in one or two media . for those  transcribed in both media,  <dig> increased their transcription over two fold, and  <dig> decreased their transcription over two fold in msm compared with pdb . for glycosyltransferases, fewer genes  were transcribed in msm than pdb . combining both media,  <dig> glycosyltransferase genes were transcribed in one or two media . for the  <dig> glycosyltransferase genes transcribed in both media, only two increased their transcription over two fold, but  <dig> decreased their transcription over two fold . for carbohydrate esterases, ten genes were transcribed in pdb and eleven were transcribed in msm . among the four predicted polysaccharide lyase genes, only two were transcribed in msm .figure  <dig>

of the  <dig> chitinase genes  in the tl genome, ten were transcribed in pdb and nine were transcribed in msm . transcription levels varied over a large range . transcription of the predominant chitinase, smf2fggw_ <dig>  was increased by  <dig> -fold . for another six chitinases transcribed in both media, the transcription levels of five  were up-regulated  in msm .

for the nine β- <dig> -glucanases, five were transcribed in pdb, and one additional enzyme was transcribed in msm at  <dig>  fpkm . the predominant β- <dig> -glucanase, smf2fggw_ <dig>  has a  <dig> -fold increase in the transcription level . for another four β- <dig> -glucanases transcribed in both media, two had elevated transcription levels in msm . the tl genome encodes four β- <dig> -glucanases; however, none of these β- <dig> -glucanases were transcribed in pdb. smf2fggw_ <dig> and smf2fggw_ <dig> were transcribed in msm .

among the  <dig> cellulolytic enzymes in the tr genome, only six were transcribed in pdb and nine were transcribed in msm . the predominant enzyme is smf2fggw_ <dig> . it has almost the same transcription level in the two media , suggesting that this enzyme is not induced by cellobiose. among the four enzymes that were transcribed in both media , only one enzyme had elevated transcription in msm .

the tr genome encodes ten hemicellulolytic enzymes. only two were transcribed in pdb . in the induction medium msm, the transcription of these two enzymes was remained almost unchanged ; however, an additional three enzymes were transcribed .

the transcription of most enzymes related to starch metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, citrate cycle, and glyoxylate cycle were altered in msm compared with pdb . in msm, the transcription of genes related to starch metabolism was down-regulated , which is in agreement with the lack of starch in msm. the transcription of most genes involved in glycolysis was down-regulated, and the transcription of the gluconeogenesis-related enzyme, fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase , was up-regulated . the majority of genes related to the citrate cycle and glyoxylate cycle were up-regulated , suggesting that energy generation in msm was up-regulated at the transcriptional level. the genome annotation revealed six genes encoding catalases . further analysis revealed that the transcription of two catalases  was decreased , which also indicates low metabolism and energy levels in the nutrient-scarce msm.

for the  <dig> annotated nrps-pks genes in the genome,  <dig> were transcribed in pdb and eleven were transcribed in msm . however, for the eleven genes transcribed in both media, the transcription of four genes was up-regulated over two fold, while no genes had down-regulated transcription over two fold . the up-regulated genes include the longest gene in the genome , which is responsible for the synthesis of 20-aa peptaibols, and a conidial yellow pigment biosynthesis polyketide synthase . the transcription of the second longest gene in the genome , which is responsible for the synthesis of 12-aa peptaibols, was also increased , although by a slightly lower amount.

splice junctions
sjs were predicted using tophat  <cit> , with a subsequent filtering and correction process . by examining the read alignment file  reported by tophat, we obtained a set of  <dig> sjs that were supported by at least two uniquely mapped paired-end reads from pooled pdb and msm reads. by searching the intron sequence using curay  as the primary motif, uuray as the secondary motif, and a modified yuray as the third motif , we located the branch site for almost all of the sjs . the distance from the branch point a to 3’ss was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  bp . we only included  <dig> sjs that had a branch point a that was within 60 bp of 3’ss in the following analysis. in addition, we performed an sj correction by excluding  <dig> sjs that partially overlapped neighboring sjs  of the same sj length. we also excluded one sj that had a sequence that contained an ‘n’. the obtained  <dig> sjs were referred to as the tophat_rev version and were used for the following analyses . further analysis of the pdb and msm samples suggested that only  <dig> sjs  were included in both the pdb and msm samples . the fggw set models included a total of  <dig> introns. comparison of rna-seq sjs with the introns in fggw models revealed that the rna-seq uncovered  <dig> new sjs that were not included in the fggw models .figure  <dig>

among the  <dig> sjs,  <dig>  had the canonical splice site pair gt-ag,  <dig>  had the noncanonical splice site pair gc-ag, and  <dig>  had the noncanonical splice site pair at-ac. the 5’ss sequences and 3’ss sequences are shown in figure 4c . the length of rna-seq introns was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  bp  . the branch site sequence is shown in figure 4c . the offset of branch point a from 3’ss was approximately  <dig>  ±  <dig>  bp , which is similar to schizosaccharomyces pombe , aspergillus nidulans , neurospora crassa , and c. neoformans  and shorter than saccharomyces cerevisiae   <cit> . the offset from the 5’ss was correlated with intron length . the alignment of 3’ss sequences did not reveal the polypyrimidine tract . a search for six consecutive nonadenine nucleotides containing at least three uridines in the intron sequence revealed that  <dig> introns  have polypyrimidine tracts. different from humans and plants, most introns  had their polypyrimidine tract between the 5’ss and branch site. similarly, a large ratio of the majority of introns in s. cerevisiae , s. pombe , a. nidulans , n. crassa , and c. neoformans  have polypyrimidine tracts in the region between the 5’ ss and branch site  <cit> .

high frequency of alternative splicing events in trichoderma
we performed a computational analysis of the most common as events, including intron retention , alternative 5’ splice site , alternative 3’ splice site , and exon skipping, in tl . by comparing the coordinates of all the rna-seq sjs , we obtained  <dig> clusters that were used for the identification of as events. a total of  <dig> as events were obtained using our procedure. the major types of as events detected in tl are shown in figure  <dig>  the details of all sj clusters are presented in additional file 1: table s <dig> figure  <dig> 
schematic diagrams of major types of alternative splicing events detected in

transcriptome.




for the  <dig> clusters that each contained only one sj,  <dig> were identified as ir and  <dig> were identified as constitutive introns . for the  <dig> clusters that each contained two sjs,  <dig> were identified as a5ss and  <dig> as a3ss. in addition to a5ss and a3ss, we also identified two other types of as events. as shown in figure  <dig>  the two sjs share a portion of intronic regions but do not share a 5’ splicing site  or a 3’ splice site . following marquez et al.  <cit> , we denoted them as “a5ss and a3ss” events  and “a5ss or a3ss” events .

in addition to clusters containing one or two sjs, we also identified  <dig> clusters that each contained three or more sjs. no exon-skipping events were identified in these clusters. these clusters can be regarded as different combinations of the above basic as events. a simple example is that all sjs in the cluster share the same 5’ss or 3’ss and these events were denoted as a multiple-alternative 5’ splicing site  and a multiple-alternative 3’ splicing site , respectively. as shown in figure  <dig>   <dig> ma3ss, including  <dig> ma3ss and  <dig> ma3ss, and  <dig> ma5ss, including  <dig> ma5ss and  <dig> ma5ss, were observed, where the numbers in parentheses indicate the total number of sjs in the cluster. in addition to ma5ss and ma3ss, there were a total of  <dig> complicated as events that are difficult to classify. we encoded these clusters by combining the total number of sjs in the cluster and the numbers of a5ss, a3ss, “a5ss and a3ss”, and “a5ss or a3ss” identified by a pairwise comparison of all sjs in the cluster.

therefore, the above analysis revealed an unexpected high ratio of as  in tl. compared with those observed in a. oryzae  <cit> , the number of total as events , ir , a5ss , and a3ss  are approximately  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> -fold higher. mapping sjs to the fggw models revealed that the alternatively spliced sjs could be mapped to  <dig> fggw models , among which  <dig> were multiexonic genes and  <dig> were monoexonic genes. therefore, approximately  <dig> % of genes  in tl are alternatively spliced. this ratio of alternatively spliced genes was much higher than what has been observed in other fungi, including  <dig> %  in m. grisea  <cit> ,  <dig> %  in u. maydis  <cit> , and  <dig> %  in a. oryzae  <cit> .

to validate the predicted as events,  <dig> ir, three a5ss, and five a3ss events were randomly selected and verified using rt-pcr . for each selected as event, a pair of exclusive pcr primers were designed and the pcr products were sequenced. as a result,  <dig> ir , two a5ss , and five a3ss  events were validated. these results suggested that the predicted as events represent true as events.

length, gc content, and splice site scores of alternatively spliced introns
all of the types of introns were carefully studied and compared . we compared the length of different types of introns and observed that the length of retained introns  was longer than constitutive introns  and the length of alternatively spliced introns except retained introns  is longer than retained introns . this result suggests that intron length can be used as a parameter to distinguish constitutive introns, retained introns, and alternatively spliced introns except retained introns. similarly, gc content can also be used as a parameter to distinguish constitutive introns, retained introns, and alternatively spliced introns except retained introns. the comparison of gc content revealed that constitutive introns have the lowest gc content , retained introns  have a higher gc content , and alternatively spliced introns except retained introns  have the highest gc content . further analysis of the 5’ss scores demonstrated that retained introns had lower 5’ss scores than constitutive introns  and alternatively spliced introns except retained introns had lower 5’ss scores than retained introns . therefore, alternatively spliced introns had weaker 5’ss signals than constitutive introns, and the 5’ss signals of retained introns are between those of constitutive introns and alternatively spliced introns except retained introns. the order of 3’ss scores and branch site scores were different from 5’ss scores. constitutive introns had similar 3’ss scores to retained introns  and lower branch site scores than retained introns , while retained introns had both higher 3’ss scores and higher branch site scores than alternatively spliced introns except retained introns .figure  <dig>

we calculated the intron retention ratio  of each retained intron and grouped retained introns into bins based on irr. the results of this analysis determined that a large number  of retained introns had an irr lower than  <dig> , among which  <dig>  retained introns had an irr lower than  <dig>  . further comparison of constitutive introns with different bins of retained introns determined that all of the bins of retained introns had longer lengths than constitutive introns  and a higher gc content than constitutive introns . this result further supported the above result that retained introns have longer lengths and higher gc contents than constitutive introns. in addition, retained intron bins with a higher irr generally had longer lengths  and higher gc contents . similarly, retained intron bins with a higher irr had lower 5’ss scores, 3’ss scores, and branch site scores . unexpectedly, the scores of constitutive introns were not higher than all of the retained intron bins, rather, they were nearer to the retained intron bin [ <dig> ,  <dig> ) or between bins [ <dig> ,  <dig> ) and [ <dig> , 1) .

in summary, retained introns, alternatively spliced introns except retained introns, and constitutive introns have different lengths, gc contents, and splice site scores. retained introns are between constitutive introns and alternatively spliced introns except retained introns. retained introns with a low irr are more similar to constitutive introns than those with high irrs.

the relative frequencies of a5ss and a3ss isoforms
we analyzed the isoform frequencies of a5ss and a3ss in pdb and msm and observed that the relative frequencies of isoforms in pdb were similar to msm . this result suggests that the relative frequencies of a5ss and a3ss isoforms are not determined by the external factors from culture media. the major difference between the isoforms was that they had different 5’ss sequences in a5ss or different 3’ss sequences in a3ss. therefore, the relative frequency of isoforms may be affected by the 5’ss and 3’ss sequences. we examined the relationship between the 5’ss/3’ss sequence and the relative frequency of the isoforms. as shown in figure 7b, the difference in isoform 5’ss scores was correlated with the logarithm of the isoform frequency ratio . the difference in isoform 3’ss scores for a3ss was also correlated with the logarithm of the isoform frequency ratio, although the correlation coefficient was low . in addition, we also examined the isoforms of “a5ss and a3ss” and “a5ss or a3ss” and observed that the difference in the sum of 5’ss scores and 3’ss scores was well correlated with logarithm of the isoform frequency ratio . these results suggest that 5’ss and 3’ss sequences affect the relative frequencies of a5ss and a3ss isoforms.figure  <dig>

discussion
the comparative transcriptomics of tl cultured in control medium, pdb, and induction medium, msm, revealed an abundance of chitinases, β- <dig> / <dig> -glucanses, cellulolytic enzymes, and hemicellulolytic enzymes that are most likely transcriptionally regulated in response to extracellular polysaccharides. however, although enzymes of different classes may hydrolyze different substrates or different types of linkages in complex substrates, cross talk between the transcriptional regulation of different enzymes cannot be excluded, i.e., the transcription level of one enzyme may also be affected by the other.

in control medium pdb, dextrose and starch are the main carbon sources. in induction medium msm, polysaccharides, including chitin, β- <dig> / <dig> -glucan, cellobiose, and xylan, are the main carbon sources for tl. compared with dextrose and starch, these polysaccharides are more difficult to utilize; therefore, it is expected that tl suffers starvation when grown in msm. the transcriptional down-regulation of glycolysis-related genes and up-regulation of gluconeogenesis-related genes are inconsistent with the low concentration of glucose in msm. therefore, the transcriptional up-regulation of citrate cycle and glyoxylate cycle-related genes may be used to compensate the low energy level of tl cells.

the observed frequency of as varies among kingdoms. compared with higher organisms, fungi exhibit less frequent as events. early studies based on ests determined that  <dig> % of genes in m. grisea  <cit> ,  <dig> % of genes in u. maydis  <cit>  and  <dig> % of genes in c. neoformans  <cit>  are alternatively spliced. a comparative study based on ests also indicated a low as frequency  for fungi s. cerevisiae, s. pombe, encephalitozoon cuniculi, and c. neoformans  <cit> . as more est data became available, more as events were observed in fungi. in a recent study examining  <dig> fungi, the as ratio was estimated at  <dig> % for m. grisea and 18% for c. neoformans  <cit> . the extraordinary as rate  for c. neoformans represents the highest as rate reported for fungi.

in addition to ests, rna-seq has also been used in as analyses. an rna-seq study based on the illumina solexa platform revealed that  <dig> % of genes  produce two or more as isoforms in the fungus a. oryzae  <cit> . this as ratio is similar to the ratio reported for a. nidulans  and a. niger  in a comparative study of  <dig> fungi  <cit> . in this study, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing of tl using the illumina solexa platform. a comprehensive analysis revealed that  <dig> % of genes are alternatively spliced. this ratio is not only much higher than fungus a. oryzae   <cit>  and closely related t. reesei   <cit> , but is also comparable to that in rice   <cit>  and arabidopsis   <cit> . the as ratio difference observed between tl and a. oryzae is likely a result of transcriptome differences because both studies performed the whole transcriptome sequencing using the illumina solexa platform.

splice recognition appears to be different in different kingdoms. a cross-kingdom analysis suggested that the exon definition mechanism is most common in multicellular animals, while the intron definition mechanism predominates in fungi and most protists  <cit> . intron retention is the major type  of as events in tl. this high ratio of intron retention suggests that the intron definition mechanism most likely also predominates in tl. although this ratio is similar to the fungus a. oryzae   <cit> , the number of retained introns  is  <dig> -fold higher than the fungus a. oryzae   <cit> . the number of retained introns may be overestimated because of possible dna contamination and the presence of  pre-mrna. in this study, dna contamination can be excluded by using selective rna isolation. irr analysis determined that  <dig> % of total retained introns have lower irrs . it is unclear whether these rare ir events  have effects in cells. if these retained introns  were excluded from our dataset, the number of retained introns would be  <dig>  and the total number of as events would be  <dig>  both still exceeding those in a. oryzae   <cit> . in this case, the ratio of alternatively spliced introns would also be very high .

compared with constitutive introns, retained introns have longer lengths, higher gc contents, and lower splice site scores. in contrast, there is no significant difference in intron length between retained introns and constitutive introns in arabidopsis  <cit> . in addition, the difference in intron length and gc content between retained introns and constitutive introns implies that the predicted retained introns in this study are most likely valid, rather than from genomic dna contamination or  pre-mrna. analyses determined that the splice site sequences of alternatively spliced introns  tend to have lower scores and be less conserved than constitutive introns . it is possible that the low conservation of splice site sequences  prompts the emergence of as, while the resultant as subsequently reduces the conservation of the splice site sequence.

the criteria for identification affect the number of predicted as. in this study, an intron was classified as an ir when it had at least one intronic site supported by one or more reads. we also applied a more stringent criterion to define an ir, that is, an intron was classified as an ir when all the intronic sites were supported by at least two independent reads. of the  <dig> predicted ir,  <dig> met this stringent criterion and were referred to as ir , and the other ir were referred to as ir . the sequence features for both ir  and ir  are presented in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  when only these ir  were considered, the total number of as are  <dig> and the as ratio is  <dig> % . this ratio is much lower than  <dig> %, but is still similar to the highest reported as ratio for fungi . in addition, the length, gc content, splice site scores were also analyzed for each irr bin of ir . it was observed that all irr bins of ir  have a longer length and higher gc content compared with ic, and high irr bins have lower 5’ss scores, 3’ss scores and branch site scores compared with ic , suggesting that these ir  may represent true ir.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study deep sequenced the transcriptome of filamentous fungus t. longibrachiatum. a comprehensive analysis of as events revealed that  <dig> % of splicing sites were alternatively spliced. the ratio of alternatively spliced genes in t. longibrachiatum is up to  <dig> %, much higher than reported for aspergillus oryzae , suggesting that as may be important for transcriptome diversity in t. longibrachiatum. alternatively spliced introns have different sequence features, including longer intron lengths, higher gc contents, and lower-scored splice site sequences. our analysis demonstrated a correlation between these factors and as, although it is uncertain to what extent these factors affect as. in addition, our analysis also indicated a correlation between splice site sequence and the relative frequencies of the isoforms in a5ss and a3ss, suggesting that splice site sequence affects the relative frequencies of isoforms in a5ss and a3ss. collectively, this study provides new insights into the as landscape in fungi.
