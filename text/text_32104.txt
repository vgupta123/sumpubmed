BACKGROUND
cholesterol oxidase  or 3ß-hydroxysteroid oxidase is a fad -dependent enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, which is capable of catalyzing two reactions, oxidation and isomerization of cholesterol to give rise ketones  using molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor to form cholest-4-en-3-one and hydrogen peroxide  <cit> .

now cholesterol oxidase has considered as one of the most widely used enzymes in clinical laboratories as it participates in bile acid biosynthesis. the cholesterol oxidase enzyme exhibit many distinct properties; it is simple, specific and highly sensitive; its clinical applications has become widespread in the determination of serum cholesterol for the assessment of atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease and other lipid disorders and for determining the risk of heart attack and thrombosis. this enzyme shows biological insecticidal activity and it has been developed as a pest control in the agricultural industry especially in transgenic crops and as a potent parricide  <cit> . cholesterol oxidases can also be used to produce a precursor for chemical synthesis of steroid hormones  <cit>  and to degrade of dietary cholesterol in foods  <cit> .

the cholesterol oxidases are classified into two types  on the basis of the nature of the fad linkages to the enzyme protein molecules. the type i and ii involve non-covalent and covalent linkage of the fad cofactors to the protein molecules, respectively  <cit> . the type i enzyme belongs to the glucose/methanol/choline  oxidoreductase family, while the type ii enzyme belongs to the vanillyl alcohol oxidase  family  <cit> . type i enzymes have been identified mostly in actinomycetes such as, streptomyces sp. sa-coo, rhodococcus equi, mycobacterium tuberculosis, corynebacterium urealyticum  <cit> . although cholesterol oxidases of both classes share the same catalytic activity, they show significant differences in their redox and kinetic properties. in general, to exhibit a broad range of steroid specificities and capability of oxidizing a number of hydroxysterols, the presence of a 3β-hydroxyl group is an important requirement for their activity in all cases  <cit> .

cholesterol oxidases have been purified and characterized from several microorganisms belongs to diverse environments and their action is strongly influenced by the environment of its substrate  <cit> . according to whitaker  <cit>  the purified enzyme was characterized by determining the optimum ph and temperature for both activity and stability. the molecular weights of the cholesterol oxidases have been reported in the range of 36–61 kda. microbial cholesterol oxidases generally have neutral ph optima and possess stability over a wide range  <cit> .

the objective of this study is to purify and characterize the cholesterol oxidase produced in the fermentation medium of streptomyces aegyptia neae  <dig>

physico-chemical characteristics of cholesterol oxidase
cholesterol oxidases from several microorganisms from various species have been isolated, purified and characterized. the activity of cholesterol oxidase of streptomyces aegyptia neae  <dig> was evaluated at various levels of temperature, ph, effect of substrate concentration and incubation time.

effect of incubation time on cholesterol oxidase activity
the cholesterol oxidase activity  increased as the incubation time increased up to 105 min . time beyond 105 min has slight decrease the activity of the enzyme .fig.  <dig> effect of different incubation periods on cholesterol oxidase




effect of temperature on cholesterol oxidase activity
the temperature optimum of cholesterol oxidase from streptomyces aegyptia neae  <dig> is shown in fig.  <dig>  it showed marked activity with range of temperatures between  <dig> and 45 °c. the maximum cholesterol oxidase activity of  <dig>  u/ml was obtained at 37 °c and at higher temperature the activity was declined. at temperature of 45 °c, the enzyme retained its  <dig> % relative activity to the optimal activity. the enzyme retains  <dig> % of its activity at 50 °c. the temperature ranges of notably cholesterol oxidase activity reported from different sources were 30–70 °c  <cit> . most cholesterol oxidases exhibit optimum temperatures for enzyme activity in the range of 50–60 °c  <cit> . the optimum temperature of cholesterol oxidase activity from rhodococcus sp. gki was found to be around 30 °c. at temperature of 45 °c, the enzyme retained its 92% relative activity to the optimal activity  <cit> . praveen et al.  <cit>  reported that the optimum temperature of cholesterol oxidase from streptomyces parvus at ph  <dig>  was 50 °c. the cholesterol oxidase from streptomyces fradiae is the most thermo-tolerant reported so far with optimum temperature of 70 °c  <cit> . optimum temperature for cholesterol oxidase activity produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa was determined by jasim and diwan  <cit>  and the results showed that the optimum temperature for enzyme activity was 35 °c when the enzyme was added to cholesterol solution and incubated at different temperatures ranged between  <dig> and 65 °c for 10 min. at this temperature, the activity was  <dig>  u/ml, and represents the optimum for enzyme activity because of the high effect on the reaction energy for both enzyme and substrate which leads to formation of enzyme–substrate complex and this will result in increasing the reaction speed as it was mentioned by urban et al.  <cit> , hence enzyme activity was decreased above and below this temperature. most enzymes are often highly sensitive to high temperatures, while others which contain disulfide bonds are more stable in high temperatures than complex enzymes with high molecular weights as it was described by segel  <cit> .fig.  <dig> effect of the temperature on cholesterol oxidase activity




other studies reported that the temperature of  <dig>   <dig> and 40 °c were optimal for cholesterol oxidase activity from brevibacterium sp.  <cit> , rhodoccocus equi and corynebacterium cholesterolicum  <cit> ; respectively. while yazdi and zahraei  <cit>  reported optimum temperature at around 50 °c and plateau between  <dig> and 60 °c for the purified enzyme from streptomyces violascens. whereas, other authors reported that the optimum temperature for cholesterol oxidase from bacillus sp., arthrobacter simplex and streptomyces violascens was found to range between  <dig> and 60 °c and obvious enzyme thermostability  <cit> . the optimum temperature for cholesterol oxidase was found to be 50 °c and it retained more than 70% activity at 50 °c after 60 min of heat treatment  <cit> . the optimal reaction temperature for cholesterol oxidase was 45 °c; it retained more than 80% activity in the temperature range 35–48 °c  <cit> . comparing the effect of different temperatures on enzyme activity under a standard condition, cholesterol oxidase showed a marked activity between  <dig> and 50 °c with maximum activity at 35 °c  <cit> . varma and nene  <cit>  found that cholesterol oxidase in the clarified fermentation broth have almost full activity at 45 °c for 1 h; at 50 °c with retained activity of 50%.

effect of ph on cholesterol oxidase activity
cholesterol oxidase activity was studied as a function of ph in range between  <dig> and  <dig> . the maximum enzyme activity at ph  <dig> is  <dig>  u/ml . at lower and higher ph’s, enzyme activity was decreased. the enzyme retains  <dig> % of its activity at ph  <dig> . however, the enzyme retains  <dig>  and  <dig> % of its activity at ph  <dig> and ph  <dig>  respectively. cholesterol oxidases from various microbial sources generally characterized to have neutral ph optima around ph  <dig>  to  <dig>  with stability over a wide ph range  <cit> . the cholesterol oxidase from streptomyces parvus exhibited maximum activity at ph  <dig>   <cit> , while ph  <dig>  was optimum for the enzyme from brevibacterium sp.  <cit> , that slightly decreased to 80% at ph range of  <dig> – <dig> . jasim and diwan  <cit>  reported that the optimum ph for cholesterol oxidase activity was ph  <dig> , when the purified enzyme was added to cholesterol solution incubated previously at a range of ph between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for 10 min at 32 °c. at this ph, enzyme activity was  <dig>  u/ml, and the activity was decreased at the acidic and basic ph values because of the conformational changes in enzyme configuration due to the changes in the ionizable groups located in the active sites of the enzyme as it was mentioned by whitaker  <cit> . similar result was reported for the cholesterol oxidase from streptomyces sp. which was most active at ph  <dig>   <cit> . the optimum ph of cholesterol oxidase reported from different sources were ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . the optimal ph for cholesterol oxidase was  <dig>  and retained more than 80% activity in the ph range of  <dig> – <dig>   <cit> . the best ph for cellular cholesterol oxidase enzyme produced by rhodococcus sp. was ph  <dig>   <cit> . cholesterol oxidase is ph dependent with maximum activity at ph around  <dig> . enzyme activity was found to be stable for at least 60 min at ph  <dig>  by exhibiting more than 80% activity  <cit> .fig.  <dig> activity of cholesterol oxidase as a function of the ph of the reaction




effect of substrate concentration on the activity of cholesterol oxidase
the influence of substrate concentration on cholesterol oxidase activity was examined at different concentrations of substrate ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm to determine the optimum concentration required to give the highest cholesterol oxidase activity. the results in fig.  <dig> showed a gradual increase in the enzyme activity with the increase in substrate concentration from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm. however, further increase in substrate concentration  lead to decrease in enzyme activity to  <dig> % with  <dig>  mm substrate. the optimum substrate concentration for maximum cholesterol oxidase activity was observed at  <dig>  mm .fig.  <dig> effect of the substrate concentration of the reaction on cholesterol oxidase activity




the typical michaelis-menten relationship was obtained between the substrate concentrations and the initial velocity of the reaction. michaelis-menten plot showed in fig.  <dig> illustrated the km and vmax values for cholesterol oxidase enzyme. the plot gave km value of  <dig>  mm and vmax of  <dig>  u/ml for the hydrolysis of cholesterol. km value is defined as the concentrations of substrate that permits the enzyme to achieve half of the maximum reaction rate  which implies that half of the enzyme active sites in the sample are filled  by substrate molecules in the steady state. km provides useful information regarding the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate  <cit> . the enzyme with a low km has strong binding affinity between the enzyme and substrate. vmax is expressed the maximum velocity of the reaction that reveals the turn over number of an enzyme which is the number of molecules of substrate converted into product by one enzyme site per second. if the molar concentration of enzyme is known, vmax be expressed as moles of product formed per second per mole of enzyme sites  <cit> . however, there are many factors that affect on kinetic parameters of the enzymes  such as; type of enzyme, different forms of enzyme , changes in enzyme conditions , source of the enzyme , type of used substrates and the assay procedures  <cit> .fig.  <dig> michaelis-menten plot for cholesterol oxidase produced by streptomyces aegyptia neae 102




doukyu et al.  <cit>  determined the km and vmax values of cholesterol oxidases from various bacterial origins. the km values were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> and 315 μm from chromobacterium sp. ds- <dig>  nocardia sp., n. erythropolis, b. cepacia, p. fluorescens and streptomyces sp., respectively. thus, the km values of cholesterol oxidase from streptomyces aegyptia neae  <dig> is relatively lower than those of b. cepacia, p. fluorescens and streptomyces sp.

athe number of calculated amino acid based on: if the mw of the purified enzyme is 46000 da and average mw of the  <dig> most common aa is 110 da, the no. of aa will be approximately 46000/110 = 418aa. trp-residues cannot be determined, based on the methodology used. pro residues were also not detectable. because of the deletion of  <dig> of the  <dig> amino acids in the calculation: w, p , we have taken away 10% of aa

CONCLUSIONS
different actinomycete strains were screened for their cholesterol oxidase activity using plate method. the promising isolate, streptomyces aegyptia neae  <dig> was selected for further studies. the crude enzyme extract was purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, dialysis and ion exchange chromatography using deae sepharose cl-6b. the enzyme was purified  <dig> -fold and showed a final specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg protein. the molecular weight of the purified cholesterol oxidase was determined as  <dig> kda. glutamic acid was the most represented amino acid in the quantified cholesterol oxidase .
