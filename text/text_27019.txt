BACKGROUND
west nile virus  is the etiological agent of west nile fever , an important mosquito-borne disease widely prevalent in africa, europe, russia, the middle east, india, australia and also in north america since  <dig>  <cit> . wnv has expanded its geographic range since the first identification of wnv cases in the united states in  <dig>  and only in  <dig>   <dig> human cases of wnf were reported in the united states  <cit> . wnv is serologically classified into the japanese encephalitis virus  serocomplex, including jev, saint-louis encephalitis virus , murray valley fever virus  and kunjin virus, all of which are responsible for severe encephalitis in humans and related animals  <cit> .

the  <dig> -kilobase genome of wnv encodes a single polyprotein, which is cleaved into three structural proteins  and seven nonstructural proteins  by both virus- and host-encoded proteases. the seven nonstructural proteins  associate with viral rna to form the replication complex  <cit> . ns <dig> is a 48-kd glycoprotein containing  <dig> invariant cysteine residues. the antigenic variability of the ns <dig> provides a useful mechanism to differentiate closely related flaviviruses  <cit> . ns <dig> is also inserted into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum via a signal peptide that is cleaved cotranslationally by a cellular signalase to generate the mature n terminus of the protein  <cit> . within infected cells, ns <dig> is believed to function as a cofactor in viral rna replication, and specific amino acids substitutions in ns <dig> can attenuate viral rna accumulation  <cit> .in vivo, highly circulating levels of the dengue virus  ns <dig> early in dengue illness correlated with the development of dengue hemorrhagic fever and other severely associated diseases  <cit> .

the diagnosis of wnv and associated diseases has long been a challenge, especially in the field of differential diagnosis. assays employing reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  are able to differentiate closely related viruses, but these assays can only be applied to specimens containing circulating virus or viral rna. serological tests for wnv infections mainly include the neutralization test, the hemagglutination-inhibiting test, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  and the immunofluorescence assay   <cit> . among these tests, the neutralization test is recognized as the "gold standard" and provides the highest specificity. however, neutralization assay requires paired acute- and convalescent-phase serum specimens, and involves manipulation of live virus which requires a high level of biocontainment. the use of the ifa as a diagnostic tool is also limited by practical issues related to biosafety. the elisa has also been used to detect immunoglobulin m  antibodies that specifically react with wnv antigens. however, these tests may be confounded by the potential cross-reactivity of antibodies with other members of the jev serocomplex or other flaviviruses  <cit> , especially in regions where several flaviviruses coexist  <cit> . in  <dig>  hall et al developed an assay in which antibodies against immunodominant epitopes in ns <dig> of mvev and kunjin viruses were used to define targets for a blocking elisa. this assay was used to detect virus-specific antibodies in sentinel animal sera, and confirmed that ns <dig> could be used as a target protein to differentiate viruses in the jev serocomplex  <cit> . in a recent study, an epitope-blocking elisa based on a wnv ns1-specific mab was established and used to differentiate wnv from jev infections in horses and to detect natural infections among vaccinated populations  <cit> .

phage display describes an in vitro selection technique in which a peptide or protein is genetically fused to a coat protein of a bacteriophage, resulting in displaying of the fused peptide or protein on the exterior of the phage virion. phage display library can consist of either a random peptide library or a gene-targeted library, and thus provides a powerful and economic technique for epitope identification. this technology can identify amino acids in protein antigens which are critical for antibody binding and, further, the definition of peptide motifs that are both structural and functional mimotopes of both protein and non-protein antigens  <cit> . several studies have reported the usefulness of phage-display applications for mapping epitopes of flaviviruses  <cit> .

the aim of our study was to identify wnv-specific and/or jev serocomplex-specific b-cell epitopes in ns <dig> using phage display technology. the information provided by this study will facilitate the development of diagnostic tools for the specific serological diagnosis of wnv infection, and will contribute to the rational design of vaccines by furthering understanding of the antigenic structure of ns <dig> 

RESULTS
production of recombinant ns1
recombinant wnv ns <dig> was successfully expressed in e. coli tb <dig> cells, predominantly as soluble protein, after induction with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside . the recombinant protein was recognized by wnv-positive equine serum in western blot  .

production and characterization of ns1-specific mabs
purified protein was used to immunize balb/c mice. after cell fusion and screening, several hybridoma cell lines were obtained which produced ns1-specific mabs. among them two cell lines were selected for their strongest reactivity against recombinant ns <dig> using indirect elisa , wb , and against native ns <dig> in ifa using wnv antigen slides . further characterization of the specificity of the two mabs by ifa, demonstrated that the mab 3c <dig> reacted with wnv, but did not react with jev, denv1- <dig>  yellow fever virus  and tick-borne encephalitis virus , whereas mab 4d <dig> reacted with both wnv and jev, but did not react with other non-jev serocomplex flaviviruses .

the subtypes of the two mabs were determined using the mouse monoab-id kit  according to the manufacturer's instructions. it was shown that the heavy chain of 3c <dig> and 4d <dig> was igg <dig> and the light chain was λ type. antibody titers of culture supernatants of the two hybridoma cell lines and the ascites prepared with them were measured by indirect elisa. antibody titers of the culture supernatants of mabs 3c <dig> and 4d <dig> were 1: <dig> and 1: <dig>  respectively; and those of the ascites were 1: <dig>  and 1: <dig> , <dig>  respectively.

phage enrichment by biopanning
preparations of mabs 3c <dig> and 4d <dig> were purified to >90%  and used to define peptide binding motifs by screening a phage-displayed 12-mer peptide library. a dramatic enrichment of 3c <dig> and 4d <dig> antibody-reactive phages was achieved with three sequential rounds of biopanning. as a measure of enrichment, we calculated output-to-input ratios following each round of selection with each mab. the output-to-input ratio is defined as the percentage of plaque-forming phages remaining after elution from the mabs. the output-to-input ratios of the three rounds of biopanning were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the mab 3c <dig>  and  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the mab 4d <dig>  indicating significant enrichment of antibody reactive phage clones.

epitope prediction
phage elisa results showed that the selected ten phage clones for every mab  demonstrated specific reactivity  in comparison to a negative control of irrelevant specific mab, the anti-porcine interferon-γ  . by sequencing to determine the insert sequences, alignment indicated that six 3c7-reactive clones  displayed a consensus sequence of ltattek. similarly, four 4d1-reactive clones  revealed another consensus sequence of vvdgpetkec. these consensus sequence motifs are identical to wnv ns <dig> sequences 895ltattek <dig> and 925vvdgpetkec <dig>  respectively .

identification of the displayed epitopes by wb using expressed polypeptides
for further epitope determination, a series of wild-type and truncated peptides deriving from ltattek  and vvdgpetkec  were produced and subjected to wb. results were shown that mbp-cp- <dig>  and mbp-cp- <dig>  were recognized by mab 3c <dig>  and only mbp-dp- <dig>  was recognized by mab 4d <dig>  whereas all other peptides were unable to react with the respective mab . these data define tattek and vvdgpetkec as the linear epitopes recognized by 3c <dig> and 4d <dig>  respectively.

reactivity of wnv/jev-positive sera with the identified ns <dig> epitopes
recombinant proteins containing the two epitopes were recognized by wnv-positive equine serum in wb , whereas they were not recognized by wnv-negative control equine serum . further cross-reaction detection showed the polypeptide dp- <dig>  could react with six jev-positive equine sera , but cp- <dig>  was not recognized by any jev-positive equine serum . this was further confirmed by elisa . these data indicate that the two peptides are antigenic in horses.

sequence similarity and prediction of cross-reactivity
to assess the degree of conservation of the linear epitopes recognized by the 3c <dig> and 4d <dig> mabs, we analyzed the ns <dig> amino acid sequences from wnv isolates including kunjin virus strains, and other members of the family flaviviridae. analysis of ns <dig> sequences from  <dig> different wnv isolates indicated that the 3c <dig> epitope, tattek is highly conserved among wnv lineage  <dig> strains including kunjin virus strains and wnv lineage  <dig> strains . limited amino acid mutations were present in wnv lineage  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> strains . notably, the sequence motif is not conserved among other members of the family flaviviridae, including other viruses of the jev serocomplex . we also performed sequence alignments for the minimal linear epitope recognized by the 4d <dig> mab. the motif vvdgpetkec was a common epitope of jev serocomplex members, including wnv, jev, mvev and slev, but was absent of non-jev serocomplex members of the family .

discussion
ns <dig> is an important non-structural protein of flaviviruses. the impact of ns <dig> activity on flavivirus rna replication, host recognition of virus-associated molecular patterns and anti-viral protective immunity has been well documented  <cit> , as it has the importance of antibodies generated against ns <dig>  studies have demonstrated that the passive administration of ns1-specific mabs or active immunization with the ns <dig> gene or protein confers protection from lethal flavivirus challenge  <cit> . such protective effect could even be observed when using ns <dig> produced by e. coli  <cit> . these results demonstrate that immune responses specifically directed against ns <dig> play important roles in conferring immune protection during infection with flaviviruses.

mabs with well-defined epitopes provide an experimental platform for studying antigen structure, and developing diagnostic reagents and therapeutics for pathogen control  <cit> . precise analysis of the epitopes in ns <dig> is important for understanding the mechanism of ns1-mediated protection. in recent years, epitope-based marker vaccine has increasingly received attentions. by inserting confirmed epitopes into a target protein to immunize animals, diagnostic methods based on the detection of antibodies generated against the inserted epitopes could be developed to investigate whether the generation of detected antibody was a result of vaccination or natural infection. ns <dig> is antigenic and elicits the generation of protective antibodies. identifying linear epitopes in ns <dig> would contribute to developing epitope markers and epitope-based marker vaccines. there are a few reports of mapping epitopes in ns <dig> of denv  <cit> , tbev  <cit>  and jev  <cit> . in the case of wnv, epitope mapping has been exclusively focused on the viral envelope  glycoprotein  <cit> . to our knowledge, there has been no report mapping epitopes in the wnv ns <dig> 

in our current study, a panel of ns1-specific mabs was produced using soluble recombinant ns <dig> expressed in e. coli. two of the strongest reactive mabs were selected for further characterization based on ifa results. the mab 3c <dig> only reacted with wnv while the mab 4d <dig> reacted with both wnv and jev, but not other non-jev serocomplex flaviviruses, such as denv1- <dig>  yfv and tbev.

the epitopes recognized by the two mabs were determined using phage display technology, which has been demonstrated to be a powerful and high-throughput tool for the rapid mapping of epitopes  <cit> . two consensus peptide sequences corresponding to896tattek <dig> and925vvdgpetkec <dig> were identified. these peptides were also recognized by wnv-positive equine serum, but not wnv-negative equine serum, indicating that the identified epitopes are antigenic in the context of bona fide wnv infection. although, our laboratory only has one wnv-positive equine serum sample from csiro australian animal health laboratory, we tested six jev-positive equine sera for reactivity against the identified linear epitopes. none of the jev-positive equine sera reacted with the 3c <dig> epitope, whereas the 4d <dig> epitope reacted with all jev-positive equine sera by wb. importantly, sequence alignment confirmed our experimental data, as the epitope recognized by 3c <dig> was completely conserved among wnv lineages  <dig>  and  <dig>  moderately conserved in wnv lineages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  but not conserved in jev. the potential cross-reactivity of 3c <dig> with wnv lineages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  where the first position of the peptide was mutated, needs to be determined. the 4d <dig> epitope is conserved in jev serocomplex members with the exception of one amino acid . however, further evaluation revealed that the v→i mutation does not affect the reactivity of 4d <dig> mab .

the high degree of antibody cross-reactivity generated among animals infected with flaviviruses has been a diagnostic challenge, and this limitation is apparent for members of jev serocomplex when using the gold standard neutralization test  <cit> . this is largely due to the presence of highly conserved and immunodominant epitopes in the viral e glycoprotein that are responsible for eliciting cross-reactive serum antibodies after infection  <cit> . thus, it is remarkable that we have identified a wnv-specific epitope in ns <dig> since such an epitope has great potential to improve wnv serological diagnostic tests and contribute to the development of epitope-based marker vaccines.

CONCLUSIONS
the tattek and vvdgpetkec are wnv ns <dig> specific linear b-cell epitopes recognized by the mabs 3c <dig> and 4d <dig>  respectively. the knowledge and reagents generated in this study may have applications in the differential diagnosis of viral infection and in the development of epitope-based marker vaccines against wnv and other viruses of jev serocomplex.
