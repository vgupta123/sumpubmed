BACKGROUND
several population-based studies have shown that low uv exposure or low plasma vitamin d metabolite levels increase prostate cancer risk  <cit> . the hormonal form of vitamin d, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> 2d) or its analogs have anti-cancer effects in cancer cells or animal tumor models that may be mediated through multiple mechanisms including inducing growth arrest, promoting cell differentiation, lowering apoptotic thresholds, and suppressing angiogenesis or metastasis . in prostate cancer cells, the growth inhibitory actions of  <dig> d require the presence of the vitamin d receptor , a ligand-inducible transcription factor  <cit> . however, it is not clear whether the chemopreventative effect of high vitamin d status in the normal, healthy prostate is mediated by the same mechanisms.

many vitamin d target genes have been identified and characterized in the context of vitamin d's traditional actions in the control of calcium metabolism  <cit> . in contrast, very few  <dig> d-regulated gene targets have been definitively identified in the context of prostate cancer, much less normal prostate biology. for example,  <dig> d directly induces transcription of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor gene p <dig> in u <dig> leukemia cells  <cit> . however, in lncap human prostate carcinoma cells  <dig> d mediated accumulation of p <dig> mrna appears to be indirect  <cit>  through induction of igf binding protein  <dig>  gene expression and suppression of igf- <dig> signaling  <cit> . a number of candidate vitamin d target genes have been identified in other cell systems but it is not clear if they are relevant to prostate cancer prevention. for example, in breast cancer cells the  <dig> d analog eb <dig> up-regulates expression of tgfβ <dig> and β <dig> mrna  <cit>  and down regulates the anti-apoptotic protein bcl- <dig>  <cit> , while in breast, ovarian, and neuroblastoma cells, c-myc has been identified as a target of  <dig> d-mediated transcriptional repression  <cit> . in addition, gene expression profiling of eb <dig> action in squamous carcinoma cells  <cit>  shows that  <dig> d modulates expression of transcripts encoding extracellular matrix proteins, cell adhesion proteins, dna repair enzymes, and factors controlling oxidative stress. these data suggest that the cancer preventive impact of  <dig> d may utilize unique mechanisms in different tissues or that  <dig> d impacts multiple pathways involved in carcinogenesis.

cdna microarray analysis has been used on both human primary prostate epithelial cells and prostate cancer cells to identify potential target genes of  <dig> d  <cit> . however, these earlier studies have limitations that prevent their results from being applied more generally, e.g. they lack the sample replication that permits statistical analysis with sufficient power. in this study we examined  <dig> d induced changes in the transcriptome of the phenotypically normal, immortalized human prostate epithelial cell line rwpe <dig>  these findings provide new insight into the mechanisms that may be used by vitamin d to prevent the development of human prostate cancer.

RESULTS
time course analysis of  <dig> d induced genes
using a 5% fdr cut-off, we identified  <dig> transcripts as significantly differentially expressed in at least one time point . following treatment with  <dig> d the number of differentially expressed transcripts was increased over time from  <dig> at  <dig> h to  <dig> at  <dig> h. at  <dig> and  <dig> h, the transcripts were predominantly up-regulated  while at the  <dig> h time point the transcripts were predominantly down-regulated .  <dig> d treatment significantly altered the expression of  <dig> transcripts at all three time points;  <dig> of these changed in the same direction and  <dig> % were up-regulated. although many of our transcript-level changes were greater than  <dig> -fold, our use of sample replicates, quality controls, and careful statistical analysis allowed us to see more subtle changes that may have biological relevance. a detailed list of all significantly differentially expressed transcripts is available in additional file  <dig>  the entire list of  <dig>  transcripts analyzed and their fdr value is available upon request.

*"any time point" indicates transcripts that were regulated in at least one time point. "all time points" indicates transcripts that were differentially expressed in the same direction at all three time points.

rt-pcr and chip confirmation of  <dig> d regulation
eleven transcripts identified in the microarray analysis as  <dig> d induced were selected for pcr validation. these were selected based upon three criterion: they are classic vitamin d target genes , they had been identified in other studies , and they spanned a wide range of expression levels .

data are expressed as mean fold change +sem of gapdh-normalized expression .

* p <  <dig>   or fdr<5% , # absent

with the exception of cyp <dig> and cd <dig>  which were higher in the array data, and trpv <dig>  which was "absent" in the array data, the expression of transcripts was similar between the array and rt-pcr analysis in vitamin d-treated rwpe <dig> cells . we also examined the  <dig> d-mediated expression of these in other prostate cell lines to determine if their regulation was a generalizable response. a similar effect of  <dig> d on these transcripts was observed cultures of primary human prostate epithelial cells, but a blunted response to  <dig> d treatment was seen in lncap cells .

potential vdr binding sites were identified in the genes for nine  <dig> d-induced transcripts using a bioinformatic approach. the binding of vdr to the promoter areas of five of these genes was demonstrated by chip analysis in  <dig> d-treated rwpe <dig> cells  and the extent of their enrichment was consistent with the  <dig> d-induced accumulation of their transcripts. this demonstrates that differential regulation of transcript levels can be both direct  and indirect .

cluster analysis for identification of groups with similar patterns of expression
patterns of  <dig> d-regulated expression were determined using self organizing maps  . across the  <dig> clusters, there were five major expression patterns: group  <dig> contained transcripts up-regulated early . group  <dig> contained transcripts down-regulated early . group  <dig> contained transcripts that were up-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> h . group  <dig> contained transcripts that were suppressed at  <dig> and  <dig> h . group  <dig> contained transcripts whose normal up-regulation over time was prevented by vitamin d .

functional analysis of differentially regulated transcripts
gene set analysis 
between  <dig> and  <dig> h the total number of significantly enriched genesets  was increased and the proportion of motif and curated genesets that were up-regulated fell . in contrast, at  <dig> h none of the cancer computational genesets were up-regulated but  <dig> of these genesets were induced at later time points. the lists of the curated, motif, and cancer computational genesets significantly regulated in the gsa analysis are available in additional files  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

* c2: curated; c3: motif; c4: cancer computational

genesets that were significantly changed at each time point were grouped according to related function . as expected, the motif genesets representing genes containing the classic dr3-type vdre were significantly enriched by  <dig> d at all three time points. two other genesets were induced at all three time points: "induced during differentiation"  and "suppressed by jnk". genesets suppressed at all time points were for vegf target genes  and cytokine pathways . genesets altered by  <dig> d treatment at  <dig> h only include one induced for "p <dig> and brca <dig> target genes", suggesting an early pro-apoptosis programming, and suppression of genesets containing wnt-, notch-, and igf1- target genes, suggesting the disruption of signals that promote cell proliferation. the shift to a less proliferative, more differentiated cell was supported by the suppression of genesets at  <dig> and  <dig> h that contain transcripts whose protein products promote proliferation and suppress differentiation .

genmapp and metacore analysis
the total number of local maps, go terms, or metacore maps influenced by  <dig> d treatment was increased over time, due to an increase in the number of suppressed maps. the detailed results from our genmapp analysis of local maps and go terms are available in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, while the metacore results are summarized in additional file  <dig>  a summary of these analyses are provided for local maps and for go terms in table  <dig> and for metacore in table  <dig> 

1% = percent in map changed; 2z = z score; 3p = permuted p value

an additional genmapp analysis was conducted to determine the functional characteristics of each of the five groups from the cluster analysis . group  <dig>  included transcripts for signal transduction, cell differentiation, response to oxidative stress, and lipid metabolism. group  <dig>  contained transcripts for cell proliferation, wnt and notch signaling, cell-cell signaling , angiogenesis, and the immune/inflammatory response. group  <dig>  included transcripts for cellular metabolism, transition metal binding, and cell redox homeostasis. group  <dig>  contains the largest number of functional groups related to cell proliferation and also contained maps for the egfr signaling pathway and sphingolipid metabolism. group  <dig>  reflects transcripts regulating a defense/inflammatory response and anti-apoptotic signaling.

we also looked at the functional categories that were regulated by  <dig> d treatment at each time point. the most prominent functional groups/maps induced at  <dig> h were for cell differentiation, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and markers of the response to oxidative stress. the go process for lipid metabolism, the local map for tissue-muscle, fat, and connective , and maps for oxidative stress  were induced at  <dig> h and at later time points. similarly, metacore maps related to apoptosis, keratins, and "cell adhesion through extracellular modeling" were up-regulated when all time points were evaluated together.

the primary suppressed function that is consistent with a hypothesized role for vitamin d in cancer prevention was cell proliferation. at the later time points a clear reduction in specific functional groups and maps related to "cell cycle regulation" was observed. consistent with this, the local map and metacore maps for wnt signaling were suppressed at  <dig> h and in the metacore analysis, notch signaling maps were significantly suppressed at  <dig> h and for all time points combined. several other interesting processes that were down-regulated significantly at later time points include: angiogenesis , androgen receptor signaling, and various aspects of the cytokine signaling .

discussion
optimal vitamin d status been proposed to prevent prostate carcinogenesis  <cit>  and this anticancer activity is most likely mediated through vdr-dependent changes in the prostate transcriptome  <cit> . by applying microarray technology to the immortalized but non-tumorigenic human prostate epithelial cell line rwpe <dig>  we have identified a number of mechanisms by which vitamin d may influence the early stages of prostate carcinogenesis. our data show that  <dig> d influences many pathways relevant to prostate carcinogenesis and they underscore the critical role of this molecule in the maintenance of prostate epithelial development, function, and turnover.

several studies have shown that  <dig> d treatment causes cell cycle arrest and growth suppression of primary prostate epithelial cell lines or prostate cancer cell lines. while this has been viewed as the major anticancer effect for  <dig> d, the mechanism accounting for this effect is not known with certainty. liu et al. showed that the cyclin-dependent kinase  inhibitor p <dig> was strongly induced by  <dig> d treatment in the monocytic cell line hl- <dig> and they identified a functional vitamin d response element  in the p <dig> promoter  <cit> . however,  <dig> d does not increase p <dig> transcript level in lncap cells  <cit>  and our data show that the impact of  <dig> d on p <dig> mrna level is modest . another cdk inhibitor, wee <dig>  is induced by  <dig> d in cultured keratinocytes leading to g2/m arrest  <cit>  and this is also modestly induced by  <dig> d in rwpe <dig> cells . we examined other transcripts related to cell cycle control in our study but most of these were suppressed only at the later time points: e.g. gas <dig>  ets <dig>  cdk <dig>  cyclin b <dig>  cyclin a, cdc25c, and cdc <dig>  this suggests that they are not primary effects of  <dig> d action.

in contrast, our microarray data suggest that disruption of wnt-signaling may be an alternative mechanism for  <dig> d-mediated growth arrest. a number of wnt pathways and genesets were reduced by  <dig> d treatment by  <dig> h, e.g. the geneset containing genes with lef1/tcf <dig> binding motifs in their promoters that includes classical wnt target genes like c-myc, cyclin d, pparδ . this is consistent with a model developed for colonocytes where vdr directly interacts with β-catenin to disrupt transcriptional events that normally increase cell proliferation  <cit> .  <dig> d treatment also induced e-cadherin mrna  <dig> -fold in rwpe <dig> cells at  <dig> h. e-cadherin antagonizes wnt signaling by inducing translocation of β-catenin to the plasma membrane . disruption of wnt/β catenin signaling could be a means whereby vitamin d treatment amplifies its impact on biology. in support of this model, network analysis in metacore identified a gene network with the β catenin/tcf gene target c-myc at its center. this network connects the suppression of c-myc expression to a large number of other transcripts that were differentially expressed by  <dig> d treatment . however, while our data shows a consistent, early suppression of wnt/β-catenin signaling, careful experimental evaluation of this hypothesis in prostate epithelial cells is needed.

our data also show that transcripts for the notch ligands, jag <dig>  jag <dig>  and dll <dig> were suppressed by  <dig> d treatment in rwpe <dig> cells . notch <dig> and jag <dig> are proposed as markers of normal prostate stem cells and they are necessary for fate determination of the proliferating stem cell  <cit> . in addition, expression of jag <dig> protein is increased in metastatic prostate cancer  <cit>  and prostate cancer cells suggesting notch <dig> and jag <dig> mediated signaling may enhance carcinogenesis  <cit> . collectively, these observations suggest that suppression of notch or its ligands by  <dig> d could be associated with cancer protection.

in addition to modulating cell grown, vitamin d has been proposed to inhibit the development of the tumor vasculature that is required for the progression of solid tumors  <cit>  by suppressing expression of vascular endothelial growth factor  family members, the major pro-angiogenic cytokines in normal prostate epithelial cells  <cit> . the impact of  <dig> d on vegf gene regulation has been confusing. in mouse embryo fibroblasts and human vascular smooth muscle cells  <dig> d induces vegfa expression through a vdre in its promoter  <cit> , yet  <dig> d can also suppress vegf-induced vasculogenesis in cultured endothelial cells and in nude mice implanted with mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells  <cit> . we found that  <dig> d treatment suppressed vegfc mrna levels at all time points . higher expression of vegfc occurs after nkx <dig>  loss in prostate cancer and is correlated with lymph node metastasis of prostate cancer  <cit> . vegf promotes angiogenesis by binding to and activating the receptors kdr, flt <dig>  and nrp <dig> and we found that  <dig> d significantly suppressed kdr and nrp <dig> expression. suppressing the activation of these receptors reduces tumor angiogenesis and promotion in the dunning cell carcinoma model  <cit> . finally, vegf signaling can be suppressed by competitive binding of semaphorins to nrp <dig>  semaphorins induce apoptosis, inhibit growth of lung and breast tumor cells  <cit> , and modulate invasion and adhesion of prostate cancer cells  <cit> . in our study,  <dig> d induced expression of several semaphorin isoforms including sema3b, 3f, and 6d . collectively our array data show that  <dig> d induces an anti-angiogenic transcript profile in rwpe <dig> cells.

while our discussion has focused on the modulation of classical anti-cancer effects, our array analysis also revealed other potential mechanisms for vitamin d mediated cancer prevention. for example, oxidative stress-induced damage of dna and other cellular components are implicated in cancer  <cit> . these effects can be prevented by induction of antioxidant defense or dna repair mechanisms that subsequently reduce the biological impact of reactive oxygen species. in our study  <dig> d influenced the expression of genes related to these events  and our observations are consistent with a previous microarray study in scc <dig> cells that showed eb1089-regulated induction of transcripts whose gene products are involved in antioxidant  and dna repair processes   <cit> . there is some evidence that  <dig> d directly regulates transcripts controlling these functions. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase  is an enzyme involved in maintaining cellular glutathione levels and its mrna was significantly induced at all time points following  <dig> d treatment in rwpe <dig> cells . recently, bao et al.  <cit>  showed that g6pd expression is controlled by  <dig> d in prostate epithelial cells through a vdre located in the first intron of the gene and that the induction of g6pd by  <dig> d protected rwpe <dig> cells against h2o2-induced apoptosis. it is also possible that vitamin d-mediated protection from pro-oxidant stress is indirect due to the induction of nuclear factor -like  <dig> , a transcription factor that controls expression of genes for many antioxidant enzyme systems  <cit> . nfe2l <dig> expression is down-regulated in prostate cancer and suppression of nfe2l <dig> promotes prostate tumor development in tramp mice  <cit> . consistent with a role for nfe2l <dig> in vitamin d-mediated cancer prevention, a number of nfe2l <dig> target genes were increased in rwpe <dig> cells after  <dig> d treatment, e.g. gpx <dig>  hmox <dig>  akr1c <dig>  and txnrd <dig> 

several studies have shown that vitamin d is anti-inflammatory and our data are consistent with these findings. in the immune system  <dig> d promotes immunotolerance and immunosuppression by altering the differentiation and function of tolerogenic dendritic cells  <cit> , suppressing nfkb signaling necessary for t helper cell activation  <cit> , and increasing the activity of regulatory t cells necessary for immunosuppression  <cit> . these actions would be expected to protect tissues from pro-inflammatory stresses that cause prostatitis  <cit>  and promote prostate carcinogenesis  <cit> . however, many cells outside of the traditional immune system have the capacity to respond to and produce immuno-modulatory factors and we found that in rwpe <dig> cells vitamin d-treatment regulated a large number of transcripts for proteins controlling immune function. in fact, induction of cd <dig> was one of the most strongly  <dig> d up-regulated transcripts in rwpe <dig> cells. prostate epithelial cells are thought to be early sensors of infection and cd <dig> and toll-like receptor  <dig>  production in these cells contributes to protection from chlamydia infection  <cit> . while a role for vitamin d-induced cd <dig> or tlr <dig> induction in the regulation of prostate infection/inflammation has not been studied directly, others have identified cd <dig> as crucial factor for vitamin d induced expression of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin in human keratinocytes  <cit> .

another point where vitamin d may inhibit inflammatory processes is through suppression of cytokine signaling and production. consistent with this, we found that  <dig> d suppressed several components of jak-stat signaling in rwpe <dig> cells including jak <dig>  stat <dig>  n-myc and stat interactor , stat <dig>  and stat <dig>  jak-stat signaling is required for the pro-proliferative effects of many cytokines including the pro-inflammatory cytokines il <dig>  il <dig> and ifnγ  <cit> . in addition, transcripts for many cytokine receptor transcripts  and cytokines  were suppressed by  <dig> d-treatment . disruption of jak-stat signaling could be a means whereby vitamin d treatment amplifies its impact on the prostate epithelial cells. in support of this model, network analysis of the data from the  <dig> h timepoint identified a gene network with stat <dig>  stat <dig>  and the transcription factor pu. <dig> at three interacting centers. this network connects the suppression of stat <dig> and stat <dig> expression to a large number of other transcripts related to immunoregulation that were differentially expressed by  <dig> d treatment . many changes in immune or cytokine signaling pathways occur only at or after  <dig> h of treatment but this reflects a clear anti-inflammatory role for  <dig> d in prostate epithelial cells that is consistent with findings by others in jurkat t cells  <cit>  and th <dig> immune cells  <cit> . in addition, nonn et al. had previously shown that in normal prostate epithelial cells,  <dig> d inhibits tnfα-induced il- <dig> production through a mechanism that requires direct transcriptional regulation of the mapk phosphatase  <dig> gene   <cit> . finally, our data suggest that nfkb signaling is modulated by  <dig> d treatment; i.e. upregulation of ikb  expression and suppression of relb mrna levels. these observations are consistent with data showing that  <dig> d suppressed secretion of il- <dig> by interfering with nfκb signaling in rwpe <dig> cells  <cit>  and that it enhanced radiosensitivity of prostate cancer cells by selectively suppressing radiation-mediated relb activation in prostate cancer cell lines  <cit> .

prostaglandin signaling is a final pro-inflammatory pathway that has been identified as vitamin d regulated by others. krishnan et al.  <cit>  found that the message for the prostaglandin inactivating enzyme 15-pgdh was significantly increased and the mrna levels for cox <dig>  an enzyme that drives production of pge <dig> levels, was significantly reduced by  <dig> d in lncap cells. moreno et al.  <cit>  subsequently showed that  <dig> d reduced the mrna levels for two prostaglandin receptors  in prostate cancer cells. since the prostanoid pathway is a critical component in acute inflammation that may contribute to the development of prostate cancer  <cit> , this suggested that vitamin d-mediated chemoprevention involves disruption of prostaglandin signaling. however, our rwpe <dig> data is not consistent with this hypothesis. in contrast to the earlier studies in lncap cells, we observed induction of cox <dig> by  <dig> d in rwpe <dig> cells  and neither 15-pgdh nor prostaglandin receptor mrna levels were altered.

the functional analysis of transcript-levels changes induced by  <dig> d reveals how the biology of prostate epithelial cells is changed by the hormone but microarray studies cannot differentiate between transcripts that are differentially regulated due to direct, vdr-mediated transcriptional activation and those that are secondary effects following the primary transcriptional events. as such, we can only infer the direct vdr gene targets based upon our data and their relationship to other studies. unfortunately, there is very little information regarding the effect of  <dig> d on the prostate epithelial cell transcriptome to draw upon from earlier studies. using a spotted cdna microarray with no sample replicates, peehl et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> transcripts as  <dig> d regulated in primary normal prostate epithelial cells and  <dig> transcripts in primary cultures of prostate cancer cells. twenty-one of the differentially regulated transcripts from the normal prostate epithelial cells and  <dig> of the transcripts from the primary prostate cancer cells were also differentially regulated by  <dig> d in rwpe <dig> cells. still, the only overlap between the three lists was cyp <dig>  dusp <dig>  akap <dig>  p2ry <dig>  bmp <dig>  tgfb <dig>  and txnrd <dig>  in contrast, of the  <dig> transcripts identified by krishnan et al.  <cit>  as differentially regulated in  <dig> d-treated lncap cells only igfbp <dig>  abca <dig> and fkbp <dig> were regulated in the same direction in rwpe <dig> cells. this suggests that the response of rwpe <dig> cells is more similar to that of primary cultures of human prostate epithelial cells.

of the genes identified in the three different prostate array studies only cyp <dig> has been identified as a direct target for  <dig> d. our chip examination of the akap <dig> and cyp26b <dig> promoters revealed significant vdr binding to putative vdres in those promoters too, but given the large number of transcript level changes we observed, we expect that many more primary vdr target genes exist in the prostate epithelial cells. before our analysis, the most comprehensive array-based analysis of  <dig> d action and putative vdr target genes was conducted by wang et al.  <cit> . using a bioinformatics approach they identified putative vdres in the promoters of genes whose transcripts were differentially regulated by treatment with eb <dig> in ssc <dig> cells . we compared their list of differentially expressed transcripts to our list of transcripts regulated by  <dig> d at  <dig> h in rwpe <dig> cells based on the assumption that the early time point is less likely to contain transcripts that are regulated as a secondary consequence of primary vitamin d-mediated transcription events. this analysis identified  <dig> transcripts that were vitamin d regulated in both cell lines.  <dig> of these had a putative vdre , including  <dig> of the  <dig> transcripts regulated by  <dig> d in both rwpe <dig> and primary prostate epithelial cells  <cit> . this suggests there may be a much larger number of direct vdr target genes than has been suggested by earlier research. future studies using either chip-chip or chip-sequencing  <cit>  will be necessary to validate whether these  <dig> transcripts are truly direct vitamin d target genes.

CONCLUSIONS
this study is the most comprehensive functional analysis of  <dig> d-induced changes in the transcript profile of non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cells. as such, it provides new insight into the mechanisms used by  <dig> d to prevent the early stages of prostate cancer. by using several independent procedures we identified multiple  <dig> d-regulated pathways and mechanisms that may disrupt the promotion of carcinogenesis in vivo. this includes anticancer mechanisms that have been traditionally attributed to  <dig> d action, e.g. suppression of cell proliferation and angiogenesis, as well as several potential new mechanisms including gene-protective and immunosuppressive effects. further research is necessary to determine whether the genes identified in our array study are direct vdr target genes as well as to determine whether these transcripts are regulated by vitamin d signaling in vivo.
