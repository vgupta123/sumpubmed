BACKGROUND
sirt <dig> is the mammalian homologue closest to yeast nad+-dependent deacetylase sir <dig> . it was originally identified as a lifespan-extending gene when over-expressed in budding yeast, caenorhabditis elegans, and drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . there are seven homologues of sirt  in mammals, and sirt <dig> is the homologue closest to sir <dig>  post-translational modification of proteins, like acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation, plays a pivotal role in the biological functions  <cit> . recently, several lines of evidence have indicated that sirt <dig> regulates various functions such as cellular survival, differentiation, and metabolism by modulating key targets via deacetylation. these targets include foxo, ku <dig>  p <dig>  nf-κb, pgc-1α  and pparγ .  <cit> . the knockout of sirt <dig> is not embryonic lethal however most null mice die in the perinatal period, exhibiting growth retardation and developmental defects in various tissues including eye, lung, pancreas, heart, and reproductive system <cit> . this indicates that sirt <dig> plays a pivotal role in the development of multiple organ systems. furthermore, sirt <dig> protects neuron from neurodegeneration in cell-based models of alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , and wallerian degeneration  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanism by which sirt <dig> functions in the central nervous system  or in the development remains unclear. in this study, to identify interacting partners for sirt <dig>  we performed yeast two-hybrid screening on human fetal brain cdna library. we found that zyxin is one of binding partners for sirt <dig> 

zyxin is primarily localized at the focal adhesion plaque complex as an adaptor protein  <cit> . zyxin contains a proline-rich domain at the n-terminus and three lim domains at the c-terminus that are cysteine-rich motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. zyxin interacts with cytoskeleton-related proteins, including α-actinin, mena/vasp, crp, and h-warts/lats <dig>  <cit> , and signaling molecules, including vav, casl, and p130cas  <cit> . focal adhesion plaques, where cells interact with the extracellular matrix , form a structure where multiple interactions and signal transduction networks crosstalk. this not only regulates cell adhesion, spreading, and motility but also transduces signals into the nucleus to regulate gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis  <cit> . lim domain proteins, including two related subfamily prototypes zyxin and paxillin, have been implicated in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and signal transduction to convey signals from the ecm to the nucleus at the focal adhesion plaques  <cit> . it was recently reported that zyxin can shuttle between the cytosol and the nucleus, where it could affect transcriptional activity  <cit> . furthermore, nuclear-accumulated zyxin executes anti-apoptotic function in cooperation with akt in myocardiac cells  <cit> .

RESULTS
identification of new binding partner for sirt1
human sirt <dig> encodes  <dig> amino acids protein with a nuclear localization signal  at the n-terminus  and a sirtuin homology domain at the center ; this domain is a conserved catalytic domain for deacetylation . we performed yeast two-hybrid screening on human fetal brain cdna library. sirt <dig> is reported to perform functions by modulating various targets via deacetylation. we used the human sirt <dig> aa 185– <dig> region, including the conserved sirtuin catalytic domain, as bait. through this screening, we found several possible interacting partners for sirt <dig> . among them, five clones were identical to human zyxin. recent studies have shown that zyxin can shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus  <cit>  and that it performs anti-apoptotic function in the nucleus  <cit> ; these are characteristic features that zyxin shares with sirt <dig>  therefore, we decided to perform a functional analysis to study the interaction between sirt <dig> and zyxin.

human zyxin encodes  <dig> amino acids protein with two major domains: the n-terminal half domain including the proline-rich region and nuclear export signal or nuclear exclusive signal  and three consecutive c-terminal lim domains  . previous reports have shown the binding regions for α-actinin, ena/vasp, crp, and h-warts/lats <dig>  <cit> , as described in figure 1b. since all identified zyxin clones in our screening contained a c-terminal region and since the lim domain was implicated in protein-protein interaction, we conducted mapping assays concentrating on the lim domain of zyxin. to map the precise region for zyxin to bind to sirt <dig>  a yeast two-hybrid assay was performed using the sirt <dig> catalytic domain  as bait and various shorter zyxin fragments as prey. as shown in figure 1c, colonies appeared only when the yeast reporter line  containing the sirt <dig> catalytic domain was transformed with the plasmid encoding the zyxin aa 176– <dig> region on a 4-do  medium lacking adenine, histidine, leucin, and tryptophan. furthermore, these colonies exhibit lacz+ phenotype on β-gal assay, indicating that the lim <dig> domain  is required for binding to the sirt <dig> catalytic domain. interestingly, we could not detect any colonies where the yeast reporter line  containing the sirt <dig> catalytic domain was transformed with plasmid encoding full-length zyxin on a 4-do medium. a previous study showed that full-length zyxin interacts with h-warts/lats <dig> in vivo but not in vitro, raising the possibility that lim1/ <dig> domains are masked in full-length zyxin and some modification might be critical for their interaction  <cit> . based on these data, the lim <dig> domain is essential for the interaction between sirt <dig> and zyxin in yeast; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that some modification might play a pivotal role for the interaction in physiological conditions.

to further confirm the region of binding of zyxin to sirt <dig>  we performed a pull-down assay using bacterially expressed recombinant gst-sirt <dig> and various fragments of ha-tagged zyxin expressed in hek293t cells . the same amount of gst-sirt <dig> fusion proteins bound to glutathione sepharose beads was incubated with various ha-tagged shorter zyxin fragments in vitro, and the retained proteins were immunoblotted with anti-ha antibody. as shown in the top panel in figure 2b, we could detect weak signals in lane  <dig> and strong signals in lane  <dig>  suggesting that gst-sirt <dig> binds to hzyx 375– <dig> aa  weakly and 444– <dig> aa  strongly in vitro. we found strong signals in lane  <dig> in the top panel in figure 2b, indicating nonspecific binding for hzyx 375– <dig> aa  to gst and/or glutathione-sepharose beads. therefore, we could not assess the interaction between hzyx 375– <dig> aa  and gst-sirt <dig>  we also could not assess the interaction between sirt <dig> and hzyx 444– <dig> , since we could detect no signals in lanes  <dig> and  <dig> in the middle panel of figure 2b. this suggested that hzyx 444– <dig>  protein might be unstable in hek293t cells. in addition, we found nonspecific binding of full-length zyxin to gst and/or glutathione-sepharose beads and no signals for the product of hzyx 1– <dig> aa  , therefore we could not assess the interactions for these proteins. taken together, these results suggest that zyxin interacts with sirt <dig> directly in vitro and that the lim2- <dig> region of zyxin might be critical for binding to sirt <dig> in vitro, which is consistent with the result that the lim <dig> domain of zyxin is essential for binding to sirt <dig> in yeast.

sub-cellular localization of sirt <dig> and zyxin in cos- <dig> cells
next, we examined the sub-cellular localization of sirt <dig> and zyxin in mammalian cells by an immunocytochemistry assay. cos- <dig> cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing myc-tagged sirt <dig> and gfp-zyxin. as shown in figure 3a, sirt <dig> is primarily localized in the nucleus with a diffused pattern. gfp-zyxin, diffusedly localized in the cytosol with some puncta, accumulates in the nucleus after treatment with leptomycin b , an inhibitor of crm1-mediated nuclear exportation . the treatment with lmb induced the accumulation of gfp-zyxin in the nucleus, where it is co-localized with sirt <dig> . to further confirm the co-localization between sirt <dig> and gfp-zyxin, we examined the co-localization using zx and zy sections taken by scanning confocal microscopy. as in figure 3b, myc-tagged sirt <dig> and gfp-zyxin are clearly co-localized in the nucleus. we then quantified the lmb-induced nuclear accumulation of zyxin. lmb treatment remarkably increases the number of cos- <dig> cells exhibiting nuclear-accumulated gfp-zyxin . taken together, these results suggest that zyxin, basically localized in the cytosol, translocates into the nucleus, where it is co-localized with sirt <dig> in cos- <dig> cells.

interaction between sirt <dig> and zyxin in mammalian cells
to confirm the interaction between sirt <dig> and zyxin in mammalian cells, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay using hek293t cells. hek293t cells were transiently co-transfected with expression vectors for ha-tagged sirt <dig> and gfp-zyxin individually or in combination, in the presence or absence of lmb. cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-gfp or anti-ha antibody, followed by western blot analysis with a reciprocal antibody. ha-tagged sirt <dig> was detected in the immunoprecipitates with anti-gfp antibody only in the presence of lmb, but not in the absence of lmb . furthermore, gfp-zyxin was also detected in the immunoprecipitates with anti-ha antibody only in the presence of lmb, but not in the absence of lmb . these data suggest that lmb induces the accumulation of gfp-zyxin in the nucleus, leading to the interaction between ha-tagged sirt <dig> and gfp-zyxin probably in the nucleus. this is consistent with our morphological data that indicate sirt <dig> and zyxin are co-localized in the nucleus with lmb treatment.

next, to confirm the interaction between endogenous sirt <dig> and gfp-zyxin, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay using hek292t cells expressing sirt <dig> endogenously. hek293t cells were transfected with gfp-zyxin expressing plasmid, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-sirt <dig> antibody or control igg, followed by western blot analysis with anti-gfp antibody . gfp-zyxin was detected in the immunoprecipitates with anti-sirt <dig> antibody, but not in those with control igg, indicating the interaction between endogenous sirt <dig> and exogenously overexpressed gfp-zyxin. taken together, these results suggest that sirt <dig> and zyxin, both shuttling between cytosol and nucleus, could interact primarily in the nucleus in hek293t cells.

expression profiles of sirt <dig> and zyxin
to examine the expression profiles of sirt <dig> and zyxin transcript, we performed real-time pcr assay using total rnas derived from various adult mouse tissues. as shown in figure 5a, the expression pattern of zyxin transcript is similar to that of sirt <dig>  with preferential expression in the lung, spleen, and testis.

then, to investigate the expression profile of sirt <dig> and zyxin transcript in the developmental brain, we performed real-time pcr assay using total rnas derived from mouse brains at various developmental stages. the expression pattern of zyxin transcript in the developmental brain is also similar to that of sirt <dig>  with preferential expression at the e13-p <dig> stage .

sirt <dig> deacetylates zyxin in vitro and in vivo
sirt <dig> is an nad+-dependent protein deacetylase that targets a wide variety of proteins to modulate their functions through deacetylation. since we used the catalytic domain of sirt <dig> as bait in our screening, we sought to investigate whether sirt <dig> deacetylates zyxin. we first performed in vitro deacetylation assay using bacterially expressed recombinant gst-sirt <dig> and gfp-zyxin expressed in hek293t cells. immunoprecipitated gfp-zyxin with anti-gfp antibody was incubated in the reaction buffer containing bacterially expressed gst-sirt <dig>  in the presence of nad+ or sirt <dig> inhibitor, nicotinamide . the samples were resolved on a sds-page, and the acetylation status was monitored by immunoblotting with anti-ac-lys antibody, a specific antibody for acetylated lysine. as shown in figure 6a, the signals for acetylated gfp-zyxin decreased in an nad+-dependent manner; this was abolished in the presence of nam. these results indicate that sirt <dig> can deacetylate zyxin directly in an nad+-dependent manner in vitro.

we next examined whether sirt <dig> mediates the deacetylation of zyxin in vivo. cos- <dig> cells were co-transfected with expressing plasmids encoding myc-tagged sirt <dig> and gfp-zyxin in the presence or absence of lmb, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-gfp antibody followed by western blot analysis using anti-ac-lys antibody to monitor acetylation levels. as shown in figure 6b, the signals for acetylated gfp-zyxin were remarkably reduced in the presence of myc-tagged sirt  as compared with the control , suggesting that sirt <dig> can deacetylate zyxin in vivo. the signals for acetylated gfp-zyxin without lmb treatment are stronger as compared to those with lmb treatment , while the amounts of total gfp-zyxin protein in immunoprecipitates are comparable . this suggests that sirt <dig> could deacetylate nuclear-accumulated zyxin. to confirm the specificity of deacetylation by sirt <dig>  we performed an in vivo deacetylation assay using sirt <dig> h363y, a loss-of-function mutant  <cit> . the signals for acetylated gfp-zyxin were remarkably enhanced by sirt <dig> h363y overexpression , indicating the specificity for deacetylation by sirt <dig>  to strengthen this result, we then examined the effect of sirt <dig> inhibitor, nicotinamide , in an in vivo deacetylation assay. hek293t cells were transfected with plasmids expressing gfp-zyxin, with or without nam treatment for  <dig> h, and gfp-zyxin was immunoprecipitated with anti-gfp antibody. the deacetylation levels were monitored by a western blot analysis with anti-ac-lys antibody. the signals for acetylated gfp-zyxin were remarkably enhanced in the presence of nam , indicating the specificity of deacetylation by sirt <dig>  taken together, these results clearly show that in mammalian cells, sirt <dig> can modulate the deacetylation levels of zyxin, most likely in the nucleus.

discussion
the present study shows that zyxin is a novel interacting partner for sirt <dig>  sirt <dig> and zyxin are co-localized in the nucleus after lmb treatment, suggesting that nuclear-accumulated zyxin interacts with sirt <dig>  sirt <dig> and zyxin transcript are both preferentially expressed in developing mouse brain and various adult tissues, including lungs, spleen, and testis. furthermore, sirt <dig> deacetylates zyxin, especially after lmb treatment, raising the possibility that sirt <dig> could modulate zyxin's functions in the nucleus via deacetylation. zyxin-null mice exhibit almost no abnormal phenotype, probably due to genetic redundancy  <cit> . on the other hand, sirt1-null mice show growth retardation and developmental defects in various tissues  <cit> , which suggests a critical role of sirt <dig> in the developmental stage. based on these reports, our data could raise the possibility that zyxin is one of the downstream effectors necessary for sirt <dig> to execute some biological functions in the developing brain and various adult tissues.

there is an apparent contradiction between the yeast and mammalian results. apparently sirt <dig> does not bind to full length zyxin in yeast because of some hypothesized masking of the lim <dig>  however, the mammalian cell experiments do show apparent association between full-length zyxin and sirt <dig>  as mentioned above, a previous study showed that full-length zyxin interacts with h-warts/lats <dig> in vivo but not in vitro, raising the possibility that lim1/ <dig> domains are masked in full-length zyxin and some modification might be critical for their interaction  <cit> . therefore we also hypothesize some modification would be required for full-length zyxin to bind to sirt <dig> in mammalian cells.

then what is the biological function of the interaction between sirt <dig> and zyxin? cell survival effect is one of the features shared by these proteins. sirt <dig> can protect neurons from oxidative stress in mammalian cells  <cit> , neurotoxicity in cell-based models for ad/tauopathies, als  <cit> , and wallerian degeneration  <cit> . sirt <dig> expression levels are induced in mouse models of neurodegeneration  <cit> , and moderate heart-specific overexpression of sirt <dig> in mice delays aging of the heart by conferring resistance to oxidative stress  <cit> . on the other hand, nuclear-accumulated zyxin can protect cardiomyctes from oxidative stress  <cit> . these reports raise the possibility that the interaction of these proteins could be implicated in cellular survival, especially in the brain and heart, during physiological senescence. since zyxin could affect transcriptional activity  <cit>  and since nuclear-accumulated zyxin executes anti-apoptotic function cooperating with akt in the nucleus  <cit> , it is possible sirt <dig> could modulate these functions of zyxin via deacetylation. considering that sirt1-null mice exhibit developmental defects with frequent exencephaly and retinal phenotype with abnormal proliferation  <cit> , it is possible that the interaction of these proteins could be implicated in cellular survival pathways in the developmental stage.

in addition, shuttling between the cytosol and the nucleus is a characteristic feature shared by sirt <dig> and zyxin. in this study, it was not determined whether the acetylation status of zyxin affects its cellular localization or whether deacetylated zyxin is retained in the nucleus. recently, it was reported that nuclear zyxin, phosphorylated by akt, interacts with acinus-s to prevent apoptosis and 14-3-3γ plays a pivotal role in the nuclear translocation of zyxin  <cit> . the morphological studies in the present study show that zyxin is localized primarily in the cytosol with puncta and it accumulates in the nucleus only with the lmb treatment, but not with insulin-like growth factor  or ly <dig> treatment, an inhibitor of pi 3-kinase, in cos- <dig> cells . this suggests that some unknown stimuli other than the igf-1-akt-related pathway could play a critical role for zyxin to translocate into the nucleus. the nuclear accumulation of zyxin is not induced by co-expression with sirt <dig>  suggesting that it is unlikely sirt <dig> enhances the accumulation and/or translocation of zyxin into the nucleus. since the sub-cellular localization of sirt <dig> differs based on cell type and differentiation  <cit> , it is possible that sirt <dig> could interact with zyxin in the cytosol depending on the cell type and differentiation.

ecm, beyond scaffolding functions, is responsible for transmitting environmental signals into cells, thereby essentially affecting all aspects of cell life, including its proliferation, differentiation, and death  <cit> . since zyxin is considered to convey signals from ecm into the nucleus at the focal adhesion plaques, we now assume that sirt <dig> could regulate the signal transmission from ecm into the nucleus by modulating zyxin's functions via deacetylation, thereby reflecting its biological functions.

finally as described in above, several functional significances could be assumed for the interaction, including the cell survival effect especially in development and/or regulation of signal transmission from ecm into the nucleus. actually we had performed experiments to investigate whether the interaction of these proteins could affect the apoptosis under stress condition or the transcriptional activity of zyxin in luciferase reporter gene assay . thus far, we could not obtain the result to indicate the biological significance of the interaction in such simple systems. additional experiments are required to clarify the functional significance of the interaction in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, zyxin could be a novel interacting partner of sirt <dig>  zyxin is an adaptor protein at focal adhesion plaque, regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and signal transduction to convey signal from the ecm  to the nucleus. our results raise the possibility that sirt <dig> regulates signal transmission from ecm to the nucleus by modulating the functions of zyxin via deacetylation.
