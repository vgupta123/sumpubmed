BACKGROUND
rna expression levels indicate the overall effect of a combination of genetic and environmental factors  <cit> , which may result in distinct phenotypic differences, including disease susceptibility  <cit> . attempts to unravel these genetic and environmental roles have met with only limited success for some complex diseases  <cit> . the emergence of new profiling technologies, including genome-wide expression arrays, has increased hope that these factors can soon be disentangled.

our current study measured rna expression in the largest genome-wide analysis of human skeletal muscle tissue of which we are aware  <cit> . in process of analyzing this data, we noticed that the expression levels for some genes showed a distinct bimodal distribution. this pattern was quite intriguing , and led us to ascertain how often such patterns occurred, and whether such were associated with diabetes-related phenotypes. we also sought to determine the relative role that genetic factors had in the influence of these bimodal patterns.

limited reports of bimodal expression patterns in other studies have also been made  <cit> , particularly when heterogeneous tissues are being contrasted  <cit>  such as between healthy and diseased tissue . however, in homogeneous tissue of apparently healthy individuals, such bimodality may be surprising, and hints at unrecognized heterogeneity which may involve precipitating factors of future disease development. previous reports of bimodality  <cit>  have suggested that 10-30% of transcripts show bimodal expression, yet with an apparent lack of replication of such findings  <cit> . as part of our analysis, we also observed that batch effects could potentially cause the artifactual detection of bimodality, inflating the prevalence estimate, but that after proper control, the prevalence of genuine bimodality in muscle tissue was in fact quite rare.

while this discrepancy in the estimated prevalence of bimodality is large and invites further investigation, the ability to distinguish genuine bimodals can lead to the more accurate evaluation of their biological role. bimodality is an important biological phenomenon as it implies the existence of discrete populations  or discrete genetic or environmental influences on a trait. as such, bimodality has historically been sought in genetic research, yet few reproducible bimodal patterns have ever been observed in this field. one might, therefore, hope that genuine bimodally expressed genes will have significant genetic importance. hence, it is most intriguing that many of the bimodal genes we identify herein have reported associations with a variety of human diseases and phenotypes. this elicits a multitude of hypotheses regarding the role of bimodal expression and human characteristics, including disease development. our analysis also evaluates the role of bimodality in one such disease - type  <dig> diabetes, by assessing the association of the identified bimodal transcripts with pre-diabetic phenotypes in this population of non-diabetic pima indians who are at high risk for developing diabetes in their lifetime.

RESULTS
prevalence of bimodal expression
the prevalence of bimodal expression was estimated from skeletal muscle biopsies taken from  <dig> non-diabetic, healthy pima indians. these tissue samples were scanned on affymetrix human exon  <dig>  st microarray chips which provide on average  <dig> expression level measurements per gene. subject characteristics are shown in table  <dig>  to assess bimodality of rna expression, we fit unimodal and bimodal distributions to the gene-level expression data coming from each of the  <dig>  core genes. we identified four clusters of chips by scan date which exhibited batch-type effects, two of which could be identified for lot numbers and fluidics station sets used in processing . these batch effects were found to potentially cause spurious detection of bimodality, and hence the analyses were performed separately in two groups of identifiable chips of size  <dig> and  <dig>  the full set of size  <dig> was also assessed for bimodality when such was observed in either of these independent groups .

the total number of bimodally expressed genes estimated in each of the chip groups using different requirements for genuine bimodality is shown in table  <dig>  this analysis by group found only a small number of genes to be bimodally expressed with little overlap between the two components of the distribution,  <dig> in group a and  <dig> in group b, comprising a total of  <dig> unique genes . of these,  <dig> genes  were found to meet the stringent bimodal criterion in group a, group b, and the total study of  <dig> samples. figure  <dig> shows the log <dig> expression level distributions for each of these confirmed bimodal genes. an additional  <dig> genes identified as bimodal had significant association with gender, of which  <dig> were located on the y chromosome .


columns represent the two groups of microarrays from which the bimodal genes were determined: group a -  <dig> microarray chips all from the same lot, time span, and fluidics station; group b -  <dig> microarray chips from two consecutive lots and from the same time span and fluidics station. the final row represents the total number of interesting bimodal genes for muscle expression in this population as estimated by the various chip groupings. a total of  <dig>  genes were analyzed for potential bimodality.

as bimodal expression may reflect either two distinct levels of transcript abundance or a single transcript abundance level with the lower mode reflecting no expression, we compared the median levels of the lower mode of the confirmed bimodal genes to the median expression levels of all other genes . the levels of the lower mode were indicative of background  for half of these confirmed bimodals - having median expression levels at the 25th or lower percentile of all genes, while four of them  appeared to have rna expression at two distinct abundance levels, each with lower modes corresponding to levels near or above the median of the high mode of erap <dig> .

many genes initially classified as bimodal in group a had very few data points  lying to the left or right of the intersection of the two component normal distributions. as discussed in methods, genuine bimodality should not reflect the potential influence of a small number of outliers. for a robust reassessment of bimodality, we deleted the lowest 5% and highest 5% of expression values by chip group for each gene. bimodality was again assessed in these trimmed data sets , with similar bimodal prevalence estimates found to the estimate which required a minimum of 10% of data points to be in each component . a combined fisher analysis of these trimmed data sets found the same set of  <dig> confirmed bimodals plus an additional  <dig> genes  to have a false discovery rate  <  <dig> . the p-values for bimodality of all  <dig>  genes in both independent batch groups are plotted in figure  <dig> 

diabetes related phenotypes and mode of expression
we assessed the association of the mode of expression with pre-diabetic traits , in the eight confirmed bimodal genes . we found insulin sensitivity as measured by a hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp to be higher in those in the low mode of actn <dig> expression  and percent body fat to be higher in those in the high mode of maoa expression . body mass index and acute insulin response to an intravenous glucose tolerance test were not found to be associated with any of the bimodal genes in this analysis.

the number of individuals measured for each phenotype varied .

a adjusted for age, gender, sibship, and heritage; bmi = body mass index , %fat = percent body fat 

b adjusted for age, gender, sibship, heritage, and % body fat; mlow = insulin sensitivity 

c adjusted for age, gender, sibship, heritage, % body fat, and mlow; air = acute insulin response 

association of bimodal expression and cis determinants
to investigate the potential cause of such bimodal expression, a subset of  <dig> individuals who were also genotyped  were analyzed for association with muscle expression levels. cis-acting snps  were sought in this population. nearly all of the confirmed bimodally expressed genes and half of the entire bimodal set had highly significant  associations between muscle tissue expression and snp genotype , and were hence expression quantitative trait loci . using the intersection of the two underlying normal distributions as the threshold for assigning individuals to either component of the bimodal distribution, the coefficient of agreement between expression component and snp genotype was high  for the majority of the confirmed bimodal genes . still, some genes had little or less than expected agreement for the density of coverage of the snp chip. for example, nr4a <dig> had no agreement at all . we further investigated this gene for any trans-determinant cause across the entire genome, but no snp approached a genome wide significance level. we also noted that while gstm <dig> had the clearest separation of expression modes, it had the lowest kappa coefficient of the seven cis-associated bimodals, possibly indicating influences other than nearby snps on the expression levels, such as environmental exposure or more complex genetic models.

prevalence of copy number variation in bimodal genes
as polymorphic deletions may greatly affect expression levels, we sought to determine the frequency with which such copy number variation  may be responsible for producing the bimodal expression patterns. the genes listed in table  <dig> were assessed from the ucsc genome browser for structural variation  that involved segments of dna larger than  <dig> kb. of the  <dig> confirmed bimodally expressed genes, copy number variation is known to be present in  <dig>  while  <dig> of the total  <dig> possible bimodal genes have currently identified copy number variation. as a comparison, we also assessed a random sample of  <dig> genes with normally distributed gene expression, and found the same number of genes - eighteen, with reported cnv in this database, indicating no difference in the prevalence of cnv in bimodal as compared to unimodally expressed genes. hence while cnv may well cause bimodal expression for some genes , for the majority of confirmed bimodals, known cnv is likely not the explanation for such a distribution.

validation in other populations
we further assessed bimodal rna expression in two publically available data sets containing expression data from healthy muscle biopsies . we found the prevalence of bimodal rna expression in these populations to be  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. these estimates were similar to the prevalence we observed, providing further validation that bimodal rna expression in healthy muscle tissue is a rare event. we also re-assessed bimodal rna expression in healthy lymphoblastoid cells  which had previously been estimated to have high bimodal prevalence  <cit> . we found the prevalence of bimodality in the restricted genes of that analysis to be only  <dig> % by our criteria, the difference largely reflecting a previously used statistical threshold which is associated with a much higher false discovery rate than that used in other bimodal expression studies. of great interest, we found that many of the bimodal genes of our analysis were also highly significant for bimodality in these other three populations . these additional validations are most compelling as clear bimodality was also rare in these other populations, with p < 10- <dig> of chance concordance of the bimodal gene sets in each of these populations with the pima bimodals . we also note that while the most clearly bimodal gene replicating in our analysis  did not show strict bimodality in these other populations, related genes were highly bimodal in these other data sets .

discussion
our detection of bimodal gene expression in skeletal muscle tissue reveals an apparently rare , yet potentially new predictor of human disease and phenotypes. of the eight confirmed bimodal genes, we found that seven were expression quantitative trait loci, as they were strongly to completely associated with possibly causal snps occurring within a 200-kb cis region of the gene. this finding suggests that the majority of bimodal genes which may be found in healthy human tissue may be the result of polymorphisms within such gene regulatory regions. in the remaining potential bimodal genes, highly significant snp associations were less common , though still more frequent than occurs genome-wide. hence in healthy individuals, eqtl are prime  locations for finding bimodally expressed genes. we also found that known copy number variation - while a potential explanation for some bimodal expression, was not found in higher abundance than across the genome, and is hence likely not the main source of such distributions.

the current study also assessed the relationship of rna expression mode with known predictors of diabetes. we observed a likely association of insulin sensitivity with mode of actn <dig> expression, with  <dig> % of the individuals falling in the higher expressed mode which was associated with insulin resistance. while not meeting strict correction for multiple testing, this gene has previously been associated with slow- and fast-twitch muscle fiber, with correlation to athletic performance  <cit> . the bimodal expression of actn <dig> could reflect a bimodal distribution in the proportion of type  <dig> fibers present in the subjects, though we are not able to assess this directly. as insulin resistance is a known predictor of diabetes  <cit> , the role of actn <dig> expression deserves further investigation.

many of the other bimodal genes identified have previously been reported to be associated with other diseases and characteristics ranging from cancer to arthritis  <cit> , some of these also reporting marked dichotomies in expression levels  <cit> . perhaps the most intriguing disease-related bimodal genes are the hla loci, as the hla system is known not only to convey risk for a variety of immune-related diseases, but contains the main genetic risk factors for type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . that three of the hla genes  were found to have bimodal distributions - as well as erap <dig> which plays a final role in producing hla peptides  <cit> , is of great interest, and we are currently further investigating the role of these genes in relation to diabetes and various metabolic phenotypes in the pima population.

the prevalence of bimodal gene expression we have observed in a healthy single tissue is approximately 100-times lower than what has been reported in mixed-tissue studies  <cit> . since these studies assessed distinct expression differences across heterogeneous tissues, a larger number of bimodally expressed genes would be expected. our consistently low estimate gives confidence that at least in healthy muscle tissue, unambiguous bimodal expression is not common - providing a new reference prevalence for bimodality in healthy tissue to which studies of bimodality in diseased and mixed tissues may be compared.

our estimate also differs greatly from the only other prevalence reported for bimodal expression in a population comprised solely of healthy persons - 28% in lymphoblastoid cells  <cit> . as the threshold for assessing bimodality in that study was much more liberal, we re-analyzed the data from this population and found only  <dig> % of genes of the limited gene set previously analyzed to show bimodality consistent with the thresholds used in our analysis . we also assessed two other publically available data sets containing muscle biopsies, finding estimates of clear bimodality in these populations to be  <dig> % and  <dig> %, and again with < <dig> % prevalence with replication of bimodality across these two data sets . these validation sets used chips which had on average  <dig> or  <dig> probes per gene, whereas our present study is the first to assess bimodality in expression data from exon arrays which contained on average  <dig> probes per gene. hence, the bimodality we observed represents a strong replicated signal which could be missed by a single probe, yet could also miss uniquely bimodal probes when averaged at the gene level. the additional validation of our confirmed bimodal genes in these other populations with low bimodal prevalence  provides even more convincing evidence of their authenticity.

we highlight two technical issues for future studies to be aware of: use of a model that allows for unequal variances in the bimodal distribution and the determining of batch effects. we observed that a model that allows for unequal variances was clearly more appropriate than a constant variance model for approximately 20% of the genuine bimodal genes identified in our data, and hence the failure to allow for such as well as differences in data scaling may contribute to some variability in prevalence estimates. even more important is the potential of batch effects to cause artifactual bimodal expression. such confounding can occur when any set of experimental factors is not uniform - causing the expression levels to be uniformly over- or under-estimated for a given transcript for a portion of the samples. we noted that these batch effects were associated more frequently with genes of higher transcript abundance levels. we also identified that chips which had distinct lot number differences and which had been processed on distinctly different fluidics station sets gave rise to such artifactual bimodality, though it was not possible to determine which of these factors had a more primary role in this study. however, because this grouped source of heterogeneity was identified for most arrays, bimodality could be analyzed in homogeneous groups, eliminating not only the unwanted bias, but also providing distinct replication sets in which tests for bimodality could be confirmed.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the prevalence of bimodal rna expression in homogeneous tissue is quite low, and hence has been unrecognized in most expression analyses. the few prior genome-wide studies which have reported bimodality may have over-estimated its prevalence, possibly due to the presence of batch effects and/or overly lenient statistical thresholds. differences in cell type, microarrays, and populations may also be responsible for some of the large difference in estimated prevalence. an additional novel insight from this analysis is that the majority of genes with bimodal rna expression apparently exhibited this pattern due to cis-polymorphisms, being expression quantitative trait loci. future investigations of bimodality in homogeneous tissues from healthy persons will be of great interest in assessing similarities and differences across other tissues and populations, as well as their association with other human characteristics and diseases. in the pimas, the association of a bimodal gene with insulin resistance and the presence of bimodality in genes from the hla locus which carries the greatest risk for type  <dig> diabetes underscore the need to further investigate and understand this interesting phenomenon.
