BACKGROUND
mesophiles, thermophiles, and hyperthermophiles
     organisms that thrive at very high temperatures have been actively studied since the discovery of thermus aquaticus in the hot springs of yellowstone in the 1960’s  <cit> . heat tolerant organisms are often separated into two classes: thermophiles, which have optimum growth temperatures  in the range 45- <dig> °c, and hyperthermophiles with ogts above  <dig> °c. mesophilic organisms are defined as those with ogt’s between  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c, while psychrophiles, which we do not address here, have ogt’s no greater than  <dig> °c. sometimes the break points between these classes are assigned slightly differently. hyperthermophiles come mostly from the kingdom archea, but there are two genera of hyperthermophilic eubacteria, namely thermotogales and aquifex. thermophiles are more phylogenetically diverse and include eubacteria, archea, and some fungi.

     in addition to providing insights into the principles of protein folding and stability, understanding what makes some proteins more thermostable than others is of practical interest. thermophilic proteins are more resistant to proteolysis and chemical denaturation, hence there is interest in engineering hyperstable biocatalysts relying on the same mechanisms that nature uses  <cit> . thermophilic polymerases, proteases, and xylanases already have industrial applications  <cit> .

the physical basis of thermophilic protein stability
     the search for the physical basis of thermostability in proteins goes back  <dig> years to the work of perutz  <cit> .  since then, a great many papers have been written on the subject. some of the proposed mechanisms/indicators of increased thermostability include: a more highly hydrophobic core  <cit> , tighter packing or compactness  <cit> , deleted or shortened loops  <cit> , greater rigidity  <cit>  , higher secondary structure content  <cit> , greater polar surface area  <cit> , fewer and/or smaller voids  <cit> , smaller surface area to volume ratio  <cit> , fewer thermolabile residues  <cit> , increased hydrogen bonding  <cit> , higher isoelectric point  <cit> , and more salt bridges/ion pairs and networks of salt bridges  <cit> .   

     statistically significant changes in sequence composition between mesophilic and thermophilic proteins have been reported. the amino acids asn, gln, met, and cys are thermolabile—they are not stable at high temperatures and tend to undergo deamidation  or oxidation   <cit> . these amino acids are less common in thermophilic proteins and the thermolabile residues that do occur are usually buried  <cit> . ile is preferred to leu in hydrophobic regions of the structure because the side chain carbons can exist in all three χ rotameric states compared to only two for leu which can result in tighter side chain packing  <cit> . farias and bonato  <cit>  have reported that gly, lys, tyr, and ile are preferred in thermophilic organisms while gln, his, ala, and cys are preferred in mesophiles. camillau and claverie  <cit>  have reported that thermophilic proteins have less gln, ala, and his on their surfaces than mesophilic proteins do and more charged residues on their surfaces, particularly lys and glu. haney et al.  <cit>  have compared  <dig> proteins from methanococcus jannaschii to mesophilic proteins from other methanococcus species and found that the frequencies of ile, glu, arg, lys, pro, and tyr are significantly greater in the thermophile and the frequencies of gly, met, gln, thr, asn, and ser are smaller.

     more ion pairs have been strongly and consistently linked with thermostability in the literature. water has a dielectric constant of about  <dig> at 0°c, which drops to  <dig> at 100°c and is lower still at the extreme pressures near hydrothermal vents in the deep sea where some hyperthermophilic organisms live. a lower dielectric constant makes electrostatic interactions stronger and therefore ion pairs should have a greater stabilizing effect at high temperatures and pressures  <cit> .

     evidence for some of these proposed mechanisms/indicators is equivocal. for instance, karshikoff and ladenstein found no significant difference in packing between thermophilic and mesophilic proteins  <cit>  and salt bridges in a protein core have been reported to be destabilizing  <cit> . das and gerstein  <cit>  have reported that the lengths of proteins from the eubacterium aquifex aeolicus are greater than those of archeal hyperthermophilic orthologs and therefore hyperthermophilic proteins may be shorter than their mesophilic counterparts simply because most hyperthermophiles are archeal, not necessarily because shorter loops promote enhanced thermostability. querol et al.  <cit>  surveyed  <dig> references for  <dig> single point mutants which have been unambiguously linked to greater thermostability and found that greater rigidity, as measured by crystallographic b-factors, is not a good indicator of thermostability.

     the overall view one comes away with from this body of work is that increased thermostability is due to relatively subtle differences in sequence and structure so that thermophilic and mesophilic orthologs are quite similar proteins . they share the same catalytic mechanisms  <cit> , although activity is typically lower at low temperatures for thermophilic enzymes  <cit> . the structures are similar, and sequence identity is usually, but not always, reasonably high.

discrimination of thermophiles and mesophiles
     liang et al. have studied the proteomes of  <dig> thermophiles and  <dig> mesophiles using the tendencies of residue pairs separated by no more than  <dig> in primary sequence to occur together to discriminate mesophilic from thermophilic proteomes  <cit> . farias and bonato  <cit>  have devised a sequence composition based index capable of correctly classifying organisms. the index ri is characteristic of a single protein and is defined as ri=/ where e, k, q, and h are the percent compositions of these amino acid types in protein i. those authors took the average of ri over all the proteins in an organism to give an average r that, without exception, fell in different ranges for the mesophiles , thermophiles , and hyperthermophiles  in their test set. further, they showed that r is high in chaperonins  in both mesophiles and thermophiles  <cit>  thereby concluding that the sequence signal is indicative of thermostability and not a phylogenetic artifact. similarly, claverie and colleagues  <cit>  have devised the cvp bias , defined as -, the sum of amino acid compositions, that they have also used to classify an organism as mesophilic, thermophilic, or hyperthermophilic by computing the average cvp for all the proteins from that organism. zeldovich et al.  <cit>  have reported a sequence composition based index defined as i+v+y+w+r+e+l  that was an extremely good predictor of thermostability when averaged over whole proteomes, and even for just the membrane proteins from these proteomes. ivywrel, again when averaged over proteomes, also correlates very well with ogt. none of these authors claim that their indices work well at discriminating individual pairs of thermophilic and mesophilic orthologs, however it is natural to ask if they can, and we will test this question here. glyakina et al. have done one of the few large scale structure based discrimination studies  <cit> .

delaunay tessellation of protein structures and quantities derived from it
     we will refer to some delaunay tessellation based descriptors of protein structure, so a brief introduction is in order. delaunay tessellation, a technique for decomposing a point set into non-overlapping tetrahedral subsets, has proven very versatile in the analysis of protein structures  <cit> . with this technique, the protein is abstracted to a set of points, here the α-carbons.  these points are joined by edges in a unique way to form a set of non-overlapping, irregular, space-filling tetrahedra also known as delaunay simplices   <cit> . residues joined by a delaunay simplex edge are natural nearest neighbors in a well defined sense  <cit> . the analysis of statistical characteristics of the tessellation of proteins has been used in fold recognition  <cit> , for structure alignment and comparison  <cit> , as a way to identify cavities in the surface of a protein that could be potential binding pockets  <cit> , to predict the stability and activity effects of point mutations  <cit> , to define structural motifs  <cit> , and to assign secondary structure  <cit> . 

     a delaunay tessellation derived four body statistical contact pseudo-potential has been reported previously  <cit>  which has been shown to contain more information than pairwise contact potentials  <cit> . under this pseudo-potential, the score of some particular amino acid quadruplet , which corresponds to the residues at the vertices of a delaunay simplex, is defined as:                     

                           

where: fijkl is the observed frequency of simplices with amino acid types i, j, k, and l at their vertices in a large non-redundant training set s; ai, aj, ak, and al are the observed frequencies of the individual amino acid types in s; and c is a combinatorial factor. variations of this potential have been successfully applied to fold recognition  <cit>  and the analysis of protein stability  <cit>  and activity  <cit> . we will denote by q the sum of the log-likelihoods qijkl from the residue quadruplets corresponding to all delaunay simplices in the tessellation of a protein structure.

     the radius of the sphere circumscribing a delaunay tetrahedron gives a measure of its eccentricity. the small, nearly equilateral tetrahedra in the interior of the tessellation have small circumsphere radii, on the order of the size of the simplices. radically skewed, nearly coplanar tetrahedra on the surface of the tessellated protein, on the other hand, can have circumsphere radii orders of magnitude larger than the diameter of the molecule. the tetrahedrality t is another measure of simplex eccentricity. denote the length of the six edges of a simplex as l <dig> - l <dig> . the tetrahedrality is then defined by:

        

protein contact graphs
     a few protein structure descriptors we will use are based on molecule contact graphs, so a brief introduction to this is also in order. the residues in contact with one another in a protein can be thought of as a graph or network  and analyzed using techniques from elementary graph theory and the theory of complex networks. in the literature, residues are typically defined to be in contact by a simple proximity cutoff, but in this work, graph nodes correspond to residues and graph edges join nodes when the corresponding residues are joined by a delaunay simplex, shorter than some fixed cutoff, in the tessellation of the protein structure.

     several contact network derived quantities have been used before to analyze protein structures  <cit> . the degree k of a node in an undirected graph is the number of edges impinging on it. the average degree over all nodes in the contact graph will be referred to as the coordination number. a minimum path between nodes i and j is one for which the sum of weights of the edges along the path is smallest from among all possible paths. the minimum path length lij between nodes i and j is the sum of the weights along a minimum path. in our case here, edges have weight one, and a minimum path is one for which the fewest edges are traversed. the characteristic path length l of a network is the average of the minimum paths between all node pairs i, j where i ≠ j. in general, there will be many paths between distinct nodes i and j that have the minimum path length. some classes of networks have the clustering property, which means that two nodes which are both joined by edges to a third, are more likely to also be joined to each other than are two nodes picked at random  <cit> . in such networks, there are well defined neighborhoods with subsets of nodes tending to be connected to each other and tending not to be connected to nodes in other neighborhoods. the clustering property is measured by the clustering coefficient of a node cn is the number of actual edges en between neighbors of node n divided by the number of possible connections between those neighbors: cn = 2en/), where k is the degree of node n. the clustering coefficient c for the entire network is the average of all the cn.

RESULTS
sequences differences
     linear least square best fit lines of number of residues in hyperthermophilic  or thermophilic proteins  to the number of residues in their mesophilic counterparts  are: nh= <dig>  nm +  <dig>  and nt= <dig>  nm +  <dig>  where there are  <dig> pairs in the hyperthermophile pairs and  <dig> in thermophile pairs . our data show that thermophilic proteins are usually somewhat shorter than their mesophilic counterparts, and hyperthermophilic proteins are shorter still. this observation is in line with the results of eisenberg  <cit> .

     tables  <dig> and  <dig> show the amino acid composition for a large nonredundant set of thermophilic, hyperthermophilic, and mesophilic proteins. t-tests were conducted to see if the average composition was different for the hyperthermophiles, thermophiles, and a control set of mesophiles. table  <dig> is in broad agreement with previously published results: there are more charged residues in thermophilic proteins and fewer polar and thermolabile residues. arg is preferred in thermophilic proteins but lys is preferred in hyperthermophilic proteins  <cit> .

t-tests of sequence percent compositions of mesophilc, thermophilic, and hyperthermophilic proteins amino acids significantly over-represented in hyperthermophiles with respect to mesophiles are: glu, ile, lys, arg, and val. amino acids significantly under-represented in hyperthermophiles with respect to mesophiles are: ala, cys, asp, his, asn, pro, gln, ser, thr, and trp. amino acids significantly over-represented in thermophiles with respect to mesophiles are: ala, glu, gly, leu, pro, arg, and val. amino acids significantly under-represented in thermophiles with respect to mesophiles are: cys, asp, lys, met, asn, gln, ser, and thr. amino acids significantly over-represented in hyperthermophiles with respect to thermophiles are: glu, ile, and lys. amino acids significantly under-represented in hyperthermophiles with respect to thermophiles are: ala, gly, his, leu, pro, gln, arg, and thr. these statistics were tabulated from nonredundant sets of  <dig> hyperthermophilic structures ,  <dig> thermophilic structures , and  <dig> mesophilic structures .

statistical significance of the fractions in table  <dig> given by a two-sided binomial test.  fractions below ~ <dig> - <dig>  should not be considered signficant.

results of discrimination experiment
     from table  <dig> it can be seen that simplex geometry based indices are generally poor discriminators as are contact network based indices. some compactness-based indices are good discriminators, for example delaunay area/volume, a measure of general compactness, and van der waals volume/delaunay volume, a measure of void space. secondary structure content, rigidity as measured by the mean b-factor, and sequence length are not very good discriminators. sequence composition based indices, particularly ivywrel and cvp are very good discriminators. delaunay derived combined sequence-structure indices are very good discriminators as well, for example the 4-body potentials and the counts of over-represented residue quadruplets. interestingly, even though the 4-body delaunay threading potential works well as a discriminator, this is apparently not true for threading potentials in general. we have tested the prosaii potential of sippl et al  <cit> , and found it to be a poor discriminator .

a table showing the discriminatory power of sequence and structure based indices-the fraction of thermophile/mesophile pairs for which the quantity was systematically higher or lower by any amount. the contact network quantities are described in the introduction. the four body threading contact potentials are described in  <cit> . the cutoff indicates that simplices with at least one edge longer than the cutoff were omitted when frequencies are tallied during the calculation of the potential. "hyper only" indicates that the potential was trained only on chains from  hyperthermophilic organisms. the delaunay simplex geometry indices are discussed in the introduction.  the volume and surface area criteria are fairly self-explanatory except, perhaps, for packing density that is defined here as the ratio of the van der waals volume of the protein divided by the all atom voronoi volume. the sequence composition based indices cvp, /, and ivywrel are described in the introduction.

     the best discriminatory indices we tested were: one version of the 4-body delaunay threading potential; the count of over-represented quadruplets; the ratio of delaunay surface area to volume ; the standard deviation of kyte-doolittle hydrophobicity ; delaunay area/volume=and van der waals volume/delaunay volume, particularly for hyperthermophiles; the cvp bias, and ivywrel. few of the tested indices  correlate even moderately well with ogt. those for which the correlation is strongest are the 4-body potentials, overrep <dig>  cvp, ivywrel, and e+k/q+h which all have r~ <dig> - <dig> .

     the delaunay simplex-based descriptors  that work best for discrimination use large simplex edge length cutoffs . this implies that there are important residue contacts on the surface of the proteins because that is invariably where simplices with very long edge lengths reside. this combined with threading potential data presented later leads us to believe that the presence of more charged residues on the protein surface is at least one of the things these descriptors pick up.

      since increased hydrophobicity of the protein core has been proposed as a mechanism for thermostability, one might expect the sum skd of the kyte-doolittle hydrophobicities of all residues would be a good discriminator. skd is not, but the variance of the kyte-doolittle hydrophobicities is . apparently, then, the increase in core hydrophobicity is accompanied by an increase in hydrophilic residues.

why the delaunay threading potential a good discriminator
     we have studied the mean contribution to the 4-body potential score q under a 7-letter reduced alphabet to each structure in the mesophilic, thermophilic, and hyperthermophilic subsets of 521nonredundant. the reduced alphabet was used to simplify the analysis by bringing down the possible number of residue quadruplets that can reside at the vertices of a delaunay tetrahedron from  <dig> for a  <dig> amino acid alphabet to  <dig>  the reduced alphabet is d, e, k, r, i=, a=, n= attributable to quadruplets with at least two hydrophobic residues is + <dig> , for quadruplets with at least two charged residues it is + <dig> , and for quadruplets with at least two polar residues it is – <dig> . for thermophilic quadruplets the Δq figures are: at least two hydrophobic residues + <dig> , at least two charged residues + <dig> , and at least two polar residues – <dig> . we see ,therefore, that the 4-body potential goes up for thermophiles both due to associations between charged residues but also due to quadruplets of more highly hydrophobic residues. the increase in charged residues produces a larger change than the stronger hydrophobics with hyperthermophiles, but the situation is reversed in thermophiles.

CONCLUSIONS
     it is possible to accurately discriminate  thermophilic proteins from their mesophilic counterparts based on sequence and structural properties. sequence based indices used to discriminate entire proteomes also work well on individual thermophile/mesophile ortholog pairs. purely structure-based indices are, generally speaking, poor discriminators. combined sequence structure indices like the threading potential are somewhat better than sequence alone.

     the primary factors differentiating thermophilic from mesophilic proteins according to our analysis are surface ion pairs and more strongly hydrophobic core residues. the conclusion of previous authors that the basis for the thermostability of thermophiles and hyper-thermophiles is somewhat different is also borne out here .

     extensions of this work currently underway include compiling larger test sets and breaking them down by kingdom of origin as well as ogt. heat shock proteins should be compared to regular proteins from the same organism and non-thermophilic archeal proteins should be compared to orthologs from thermophiles. proteins from psychrophiles should be analyzed too. it would be a small step to use more sophisticated pattern recognition methods to discriminate or classify based on multiple indices.

     finally, it may be possible to design a thermostable protein from a non-thermostable one by an adaptive walk in sequence space, threading the altered sequences onto the structure of the non-thermostable protein, such that one or more of the good discriminators described here always increases.
