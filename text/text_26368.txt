BACKGROUND
lepidoptera sex pheromones are primarily c10-c <dig> long straight chain unsaturated alcohols, aldehydes or acetate esters  <cit> , biosynthesised and released mainly from pheromone glands located between the 8th and 9th abdominal segments of the female moths. usually the females use a mixture of compounds in a unique ratio to attract conspecific males  <cit> . the extremely high specificity and sensitivity of species-specific pheromones make them potential biological control agents for population monitoring, mass trapping and reducing pesticide use in integrated pest management  programs  <cit> . further use of pheromones in such strategies would be aided by an understanding of the pathways involved in pheromone biosynthesis and transport.

most sex pheromone blends of lepidoptera insects are synthesised de novo via modified fatty acid biosynthesis pathways  <cit>  and gland-specific enzymes are involved in desaturation, chain shortening, reduction and acetylation  <cit> . different species use different combinations of these reactions to produce unique species-specific pheromone blends. the first step is the synthesis of saturated fatty acid precursors malonyl-coa from acetyl-coa by acetyl-coa carboxylase  and fatty acid synthetase   <cit> . labeling studies conducted with acetate indicated that malonyl-coa and nadph are used by fas to produce mainly saturated stearic acid  and palmitic acid  with  <dig> and  <dig> carbon atoms and no double bonds, respectively, as precursors  <cit> . modification of the fatty acid chain includes the introduction of a double bond by desaturases specific to pheromone biosynthesis followed by chain shortening using specific β–oxidation enzymes  <cit> . so far, several types of desaturases have been extensively studied through gene characterization and expression analysis, including Δ <dig>  <cit> , Δ <dig>  <cit> , Δ <dig>  <cit> , Δ <dig>  <cit> , and Δ <dig>  <cit>  desaturases. once unsaturated pheromone precursor with a specific chain-length is produced, the carboxyl carbon is modified to form one of functional groups . these modifications require the enzymes fatty acid reductase to produce the alcohols from the fatty acyl precursor  <cit> , which in some species may be oxidized to aldehydes serving as pheromone components  <cit> , and to acetate esters  by acetyltransferase  <cit> . recently, a few members of the reductase gene family have been discovered and functionally characterized in several lepidoptera species, including ostrinia scapulalis <cit> , heliothis virescens, heliothis subflexa, helicoverpa armigera, helicoverpa assulta <cit> , ostrinia nubilalis <cit> , yponomeuta evonymellus , yponomeuta padellus  and yponomeuta rorellus   <cit> . a number of pheromone gland-specific enzymes have been identified and their essential functions in pheromone production demonstrated in vitro as well as in vivo. for example, using rna interference, matsumoto and colleagues showed that two pheromone gland-specific enzymes  are responsible for pheromone production in the silk moth bombyx mori <cit> .

after production and release of the sex pheromone components by female moths the males detect the pheromone and respond for mating. it is commonly accepted that pheromone molecules are captured and transported to the pheromone receptors on the dendrites of pheromone-sensitive neurons by olfactory binding proteins, including odorant binding proteins  and chemosensory proteins   <cit> . pheromone binding proteins  bind to sex pheromone components and classified into a subclass of obps  <cit> . after activation of the pheromone receptors the olfactory signals must be degraded rapidly to prevent from prolonged neuronal excitation  <cit> . this may involve pheromone degrading enzymes  capable of degrading the pheromone molecules  <cit> .

the black cutworm agrotis ipsilon is a destructive polyphagous insect pest of many crops and for a strain from china the female sex pheromone blend comprises five main acetate components: -11-hexadecenyl acetate , -9-tetradecenyl acetate , -7-dodecenyl acetate , -8-dodecenyl acetate  and -5-decenyl acetate   <cit> . these components indicate the involvement of different desaturases and ß-oxidases during the sex pheromone biosynthesis. however, the genes/proteins and their specific function in mediating a. ipsilon pheromone production, transport and degradation have not been characterized. over the last few years, the next generation sequencing such as  <dig> pyrosequencing technique provides an easy and effective method for the discovery of novel genes. in present study, using the roche gs flx titanium sequencing platform, we report a genetic database of the genes expressed in the pheromone glands of a. ipsilon and the identification of genes with putative roles in pheromone biosynthesis, degradation and transport as well as their tissue expression profiles.

RESULTS
 <dig> sequencing and unigene assembly
sequencing of a cdna library prepared from mrnas of the pheromone glands of a. ipsilon gave a total of  <dig>  raw reads with an average length of  <dig> base pairs . after trimming adaptor sequences and removing low quality sequences,  <dig>  clean reads remained with an average length of  <dig> bp. the size distribution of the clean reads is shown in additional file  <dig>  the sequences of all reads have been deposited in the ncbi sra database with the accession number srx <dig> 

the  <dig>  clean reads were assembled into  <dig>  unigenes, including  <dig>  contigs  and  <dig>  singletons , the largest transcriptome dataset so far from moth sex pheromone glands. an overview of the sequencing and assembly results is presented in table  <dig>  the length of the assembled unigenes ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp with an average length of  <dig> bp. among the unigenes,  <dig>   are between  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp long with an average length of  <dig> bp. these unigenes are in fact transcripts in the a. ipsilon pheromone gland cdna library. therefore we refer them as transcripts. all sequences of the unigenes used in the current study are provided in additional file  <dig> 

analysis of the transcripts from the a. ipsilon pheromone gland
blastx and blastn were used to compare each a. ipsilon transcript with a cut-off e-value of  <dig> e- <dig> against genebank entries.  <dig>  transcripts  had blastx hits in the non-redundant protein  databases and  <dig>   had blastn hits in the non-redundant nucleotide sequence  databases. this is consistent with a previous report of h. virescens pheromone gland ests  <cit> . some of the a. ipsilon transcripts were homologous to those from more than one species but in general most were homologous to other lepidoptera species taking up  <dig>  in the  <dig>  blastn hits, including  <dig>   to b. mori entries. the second highest hits were to dipteran species with  <dig> hits to d. melanogaster and  <dig> and  <dig> hits to the mosquitoes anopheles gambiae and aedes aegypti, respectively. the lowest hits were to the wasp nasonia vitripennis , the beetle tribolium castaneum  and the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum . the top  <dig> insect species that have significant blastn hits are shown in figure  <dig> 

gene ontology of the genes expressed in the a. ipsilon pheromone gland
the  <dig>  assembled transcripts were annotated into different functional groups according to gene ontology  analysis. some transcripts were annotated into more than one go category. of the  <dig>  transcripts,  <dig>   could be assigned to a go category . the “cellular process” and “metabolic process” go categories were most abundantly represented with  <dig>   and  <dig>   transcripts, respectively, within the biological process go ontology. in the “cellular components” go ontology the transcripts were mainly distributed in cell   and cell part  . the go analysis also showed that in the molecular function ontology  <dig>  transcripts  were annotated as having binding functions and  <dig>   to have catalytic activity.

comparative analysis of transcripts in lepidoptera pheromone glands
in order to compare the a. ipsilon pheromone gland transcriptome with those from other lepidoptera and to identify a. ipsilon transcripts with potential involvement in sex pheromone production and transport we downloaded the pheromone gland ests of three other lepidoptera a. segetum, b. mori and h. virescens from the dbest database of ncbi and previously published pheromone gland transcriptome of h. virescens <cit> . after assembling these ests we obtained  <dig> unigenes from a. segetum,  <dig> from b. mori and  <dig> from h. virescens with an average length of  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively. these are much lower numbers than that obtained by the current study through the  <dig> sequencing of the a. ipisilon pheromone gland, demonstrating that our pheromone gland transcriptome is currently the largest transcriptome resource for an insect pheromone gland.

when comparing the pheromone gland transcripts pairwise using best bidirectional hits, we found that there were  <dig> homologous transcripts between a. ipsilon and a. segetum,  <dig> homologous transcripts between a. ipsilon and b. mori, and  <dig> homologous transcripts between a. ipsilon and h. virescens . a large portion of a. ipsilon transcripts   had no homologous ests in the available pheromone gland est libraries of the other  <dig> species. this may be due to the larger dataset  for a. ipsilon and lower coverage in the other studies. nevertheless, it was shown that  <dig> transcripts,  <dig>  transcripts and  <dig>  transcripts are only found in a. segetum, h. virescen and b. mori, respectively, in our comparison .

transcript abundance in the a. ipsilon pheromone gland
the pheromone gland mrna samples used for constructing the cdna library were non-normalized and non-amplified by pcr, so the reads in the sequencing dataset most likely represent the relative abundance of each assembled transcript in the pheromone gland as summarized in table  <dig>  the most abundant transcripts include vitellogenin, a major reproductive protein in insects ;  <dig> % reads), the precursor of egg yolk proteins for insect egg production  <cit>  and genes involved in pban stimulated pheromone production such as lipase  <dig>  <cit>   and in sex pheromone biosynthesis such as acyl-coa desaturase  and in lipid transport such as apolipophorin iii . another highly abundant transcript  with  <dig>  rpkm encodes a csp with a 76% protein identity to the h. virescens csp  and 41% to the ejaculatory bulb-specific protein  <dig> of d. melanogaster .

candidate genes in the a. ipsilon pheromone gland with putative functions in pheromone production, transport and degradation
the overall enzymatic steps during pheromone biosynthesis in a. ipsilon are likely to be similar to those in other moth species, which include fatty acid synthesis, desaturation, chain shortening, reduction and acetylation  <cit> . by homologous searches we identified members of gene subfamilies in the a. ipsilon pheromone gland transcriptome putatively involved in these biosynthetic processes and pheromone production, including transcripts putatively encoding  <dig> synthases ,  <dig> desaturases,  <dig> acyl-coa reductases,  <dig> alcohol oxidases and  <dig> acetyltransferases as well as  <dig> aldehyde reductases ;  <dig> transcripts encoding putative pheromone degradation enzymes ;  <dig> transcripts encoding putative csps and  <dig> transcripts encoding putative obps . their abundances in the pheromone gland transcriptome are shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  we further validated and characterized the expression level and the tissue distribution of these genes by rt-pcr and qrt-pcr and summarised below. there is a clear agreement between the transcript abundance estimated by the transcriptome sequencing and transcript expression level in the pheromone gland as measured by rt-pcr and qrt-pcr.

receptor for the pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide 
pban is released from the suboesophagal ganglion in the brain and goes to the hemolymph, where it binds to the pban receptor in the membrane of the pheromone gland and triggers the pheromone production  <cit> . although there was no pban receptor found in the pheromone gland transcriptome of h. virescens <cit>  we found one transcript  encoding a protein highly homologous to pban receptor isoform b. it has very low abundance in the a. ipsilon transcriptome  but high amino acid identity of 97% to h. virescens pban receptor in genbank   <cit> .

acetyl-coa carboxylase 
saturated long chain fatty acids are the precursors of sex pheromones in most moth species. their biosynthesis is started by acc catalysing the production of malonyl-coa from acetyl-coa in the first committed biosynthesis step  <cit> . in the a. ipsilon pheromone gland we found two transcripts  encoding accs. acc-jx <dig> with an open reading frame  of  <dig> bp encodes for a acc with 67% amino acid identity with the acc of t. castaneum  and acc-jx <dig> encodes a protein with 56% amino acid identity with the acc of h. virescens  . the rt-pcr and qrt-pcr revealed that both acc-jx <dig> and acc-jx <dig> are highly expressed in the pheromone gland as compared to the body . however, they have very low abundance  in the transcriptome .

fatty acid synthase 
fas has been shown to catalyse the conversion of malonyl-coa and nadph to produce saturated fatty acids  <cit> . we identified one putative fas transcript  in the a. ipsilon pheromone gland , containing an orf of  <dig> bp and encoding a fas with 57% amino acid identity to the fas of t. castaneum . the rt-pcr and qrt-pcr revealed that fas-jx <dig> is highly expressed in the pheromone gland  and also has a high abundance  in the transcriptome .

desaturase 
pheromone-specific desaturases introduce double bond into the fatty acids at specific positions along the chain. five putative sex pheromone components extracted from a. ipsilon sex pheromone gland are unsaturated fatty acids with acetate as the functional group and  <dig> or less carbons  <cit> . at least three active pheromone components  have been identified in a. ipsilon strains from china  <cit> , north america  <cit> , france  <cit>  and japan  <cit> . it is reasonable to propose that the saturated fatty acid precursor of a. ipsilon sex pheromones would be palmitic acid  which is desaturated by ∆11-desaturase to form the precursor z11-16:acyl-coa for the production of two major  and two minor  pheromone components . it is not clear how the minor pheromone component  is synthesized in a. ipsilon, which should involve a ∆12-desaturase. other studies in lepidoptera species support a ∆11-desaturase acting on palmitic acid and leading to the production of the sex pheromone components  <cit> . in the a. ipsilon pheromone gland transctiptome  <dig> transcripts have high homology to genes encoding desaturases . des-jx <dig> is homologous to a gene encoding an acyl-coa ∆9-desaturase in m. brassicae  with an amino acid identity of 96%. ∆9-desaturase makes oleic acid from stearic acid  and possibly palmitoleic acid from palmitic acid  <cit> . it would not participate in the biosynthesis of a. ipsilon sex pheromones. des-jx <dig> encodes a protein with 87% amino acid identity with the acyl-coa ∆ <dig> desaturase of m. brassicae . des-jx <dig>  des-jx <dig> and des-jx <dig> encode proteins, respectively, with 94% amino acid identity to the acyl-coa desaturase from h. assulta , 64% amino acid identity to a s. littoralis desaturase  and 93% amino acid identity to an acyl-coa desaturase of s. exigua . these transcripts could possibly encode ∆12-desaturases in a. ipsilon in formation of the minor pheromone component z8-12:oac from the precursor z12-16:acyl-coa. however, they could also function as ∆9-desaturase. further study on their enzyme activity could confirm their role in the sex pheromone biosynthesis. the rt-pcr and qrt-pcr results indicated that des-jx <dig> and des-jx <dig> are highly expressed in the a. ipsilon pheromone gland compared with the body  . one of the transcripts  is also highly abundant  in the pheromone gland transcriptome , suggesting a possible role in a. ipsilon sex pheromone biosynthesis.

fatty acyl-coa reductase 
once a specific Δ <dig> and possibly Δ <dig> double bond is introduced into fatty acid precursors to form a fatty acyl-coa precursor, the chain of the precursors is then shortened sequentially by ß–oxidation to form different shorter chain fatty acyl-coa precursors  <cit> . these precursors are further reduced individually by fatty acyl reductase  to form corresponding fatty alcohols  <cit> . in the a. ipsilon pheromone gland transcriptome there are  <dig> transcripts homologous to putative far genes . among them,  <dig> transcripts encode proteins with 59%-80% amino acid identity to the fatty-acyl coa reductases of ostrinia nubilalis . other far transcripts are homologous to the fatty acyl-coa reductase from a wide range of insect species including h. virescens, n. vitripennis, danaus plexippus, bombus terrestris and apis mellifera with amino acid identities of about 60% . the rt-pcr and qrt-pcr results indicated that three transcripts  are highly expressed in the pheromone gland . the other ten transcripts seem equally expressed in the pheromone gland and the body or highly expressed in the body. all far transcripts except two  have low abundance  in the pheromone gland transcriptome .

alcohol oxidase/dehydrogenase 
fatty alcohols can be used as pheromone components in many moth species, and they are also pheromone intermediates to produce aldehyde pheromones by the alcohol oxidases  <cit> . in the a. ipsilon pg  <dig> homologous genes of alcohol oxidase/dehydrogenase were identified, the blastx results revealed three unigenes  are with the amino acid identity of 43%, 55% and 64%, respectively, to a putative alcohol dehydrogenase of d. plexippus , and one unigene  are homologous to another putative alcohol dehydrogenase of d. plexippus  with the amino acid identity of 68%. aox-kc <dig> showed 78% amino acid identity with the alcohol dehydrogenase of h. virescens . the rt-pcr and qrt-pcr results indicated that aox-kc <dig> and aox-kc <dig> showed a higher expressed level in the pg than in the body .

aldehyde reductase 
aldehyde reductases are members of the aldo-ketoreductase superfamily and could be used to reduce long-chain acyl-coa to form alcohol intermediates  <cit> . in the a. ipsilon pheromone gland we identified  <dig> transcripts with homology to the aldo-ketoreductases of papilio dardanus, b. mori, h. armigera, d. plexippus, culex quinquefasciatus, h. virescens and papilio xuthus . the derived protein sequences of these  <dig> transcripts show 53%-88% amino acid identity with their homologs in other insects. the rt-pcr and qrt-pcr results indicated that ar-kc <dig> and ar-kc <dig> are mainly expressed in the pheromone gland, while the other  <dig> putative aldehyde reductase transcripts have equal expression levels between the pheromone gland and the body or a higher expression level in the body . all aldehyde reductase transcripts are present at low abundance  in the pheromone gland transcriptome . the involvement of aldehyde reductase in sex pheromone biosynthesis has not been demonstrated in moth species.

acetyltransferase 
the fatty acid alcohols are used as pheromone components in many moth species. in a. ipsilon whose sex pheromone blends comprise only acetates, they are intermediates and acetylated to pheromone components as acetate esters by actyltransferases  <cit> . in the a. ipsilon pheromone gland transcriptome  <dig> acetyltransferase homologous transcripts were identified ,  <dig> of them  encode proteins that are homologous to the acetyltransferase of d. plexippus  with relatively high amino acid identities , one  encodes a protein with 90% amino acid identity to h. virescens acetyltransferase  and one  encodes a protein with 86% amino acid identity with the acetyltransferase of b. mori . the rt-pcr and qrt-pcr revealed that three transcripts  are mainly expressed in the pheromone gland  and have a relative high abundance of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> rpkm, respectively in the pheromone gland transcriptome .

genes encoding candidate pheromone degrading enzymes in the a. ipsilon pheromone gland
it would be potentially harmful to insects if pheromone molecules and other odorants remained on the olfactory receptors after they had stimulated the olfactory receptor neurons . it is therefore thought that there are mechanisms to protect the orns by odorant degrading enzymes   <cit>  including esterases  <cit> , aldehyde oxidases  <cit> , cytochromes p <dig>  <cit> , carboxyl esterase  <cit> , and glutathione s-transferase   <cit> . in this study, we identified  <dig> transcripts predicted to encode esterases in the a. ipsilon pheromone gland, and the blastx results showed that all have very high amino acid identities with the antennal esterases of s. littoralis , we named them as aipscxe1-aipscxe <dig> and aipscxe <dig> following the nomenclature in s. littoralis. our qrt-pcr results revealed that  <dig> of the transcripts  are antennal-enriched,  <dig>  are both antennal- and pheromone gland-enriched and the remaining  <dig>  have similar expression levels in antennae, body and pheromone gland, suggesting they are not pheromone specific .

genes encoding candidate pheromone carrier proteins in the a. ipsilon pheromone gland
moth sex pheromones are synthesised and protected from degradation until being released from the female pheromone gland and it has been proposed that obps and csps could participate in this process. in this study we have identified transcripts of  <dig> obps and  <dig> csps from the a. ipsilon pheromone gland , all of these have the typical insect obp sequence motif c1-x15-39-c2-x3-c3-x21-44-c4-x7-12-c5-x8-c <dig>  <cit>  or csp sequence motif c1-x6-8-c2-x16-21-c3-x2-c <dig> <cit> . one csp transcript, aipscsp <dig> seems to be gland-specific and has an extremely high expression level  in the pheromone glands compared with the antennae and body and a relative high abundance in the pheromone gland transcriptome. aipscsp <dig> shows a higher expression level in the pheromone gland   and is extremely abundant with  <dig>  rpkm in the pheromone gland transcriptome .

there is one obp transcript  which is highly expressed in the pheromone gland , and  <dig> obps  are highly expressed in the antennae . this high expression of obps and csps in the pheromone gland is interesting because it suggests a possible involvement in carrying and releasing sex pheromones as demonstrated for the antennal obps and csps. however, the molecular mechanisms that connect these proteins with the involvement of pheromone production needs further investigation. no ors, irs and snmps are identified in the a. ipsilon pheromone gland.

CONCLUSIONS
the black cutworm a. ipsilon is a destructive pest of many crops  <cit>  and mainly controlled by chemical pesticides, which has led to the development of resistance to various compounds  <cit> . our study provides information and resource to identify and facilitate functional studies of genes responsible for pheromone production, transport and degradation at the molecular level both in vivo and in vitro.

by deep sequencing of the a. ipsilon sex pheromone gland transcriptome, we have identified  <dig> transcripts encoding enzymes putative involved in pheromone production. this is the first study reporting the key enzyme ∆11-desaturase involved in a. ipsilon sex pheromone biosynthesis. one new transcript  encoding a desaturase is highly abundant in the transcriptome and highly expressed in the pheromone gland, suggesting this desaturase encoded by des-jx <dig> or other newly identified transcripts  may play important roles in a. ipsilon sex pheromone biosynthesis. they may contribute in the introducing a double bond at c <dig> and c <dig> positions of the saturated fatty acid precursor palmitic acid for the production of pheromone precursors. further studies are needed to confirm the substrates and the products thus the involvement of these desaturases and other newly identified genes such as those encoding for aldehyde reductases and acetyltransferases in a. ipsilon sex pheromone biosynthesis. two of the csps are highly abundant transcripts  with 100- and 10-fold higher transcription level, respectively than in the body. furthermore aipscsp <dig> and aipsobp <dig> are pheromone gland-specific and –enriched, respectively . this suggests a functional role of the pg-enriched csps and obps in sex pheromone transport and release. it is clear that during perireceptor event after pheromones and odorants enter the sensillun lymph that the antennae-specific odorant binding proteins  capture these hydrophobic pheromone and odorant and deliver them to the membrane-bound olfactory receptors   <cit> . further study of these pg-expressed obps, especially their binding to sex pheromone components is needed to confirm its function.
