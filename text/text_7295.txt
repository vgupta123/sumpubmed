BACKGROUND
the core promoter is defined as the genomic region required for recruitment of the transcription apparatus and can be considered as the priming stage for transcription initiation  <cit> . recruitment of rna polymerase ii requires the assembly of a preinitiation complex, including the basal transcription factors tfiia, b, d, e, f and h near the transcriptional start site  <cit> . in addition, transcriptional regulation often involves tafs , mediator complex, and positive or negative cofactors, which associate with cis-acting dna sequences often located further upstream or sometimes downstream of the start site  <cit> . only 10â€“20% of the promoters in mammals, drosophila and arabidopsis contain a tata box, a conserved at-rich sequence motif approximately  <dig> bp upstream from the first transcribed nucleotide  <cit> . in mammals, this minority of promoters is often associated with tissue-specific genes and high conservation across species  <cit> . the tata box associates with tbp, the tata box binding protein, which as an element of the tfiid factor also binds to many tata-less promoters  <cit> . genomic screening approaches in yeast suggest that the presence of tbp in the chromatin near a promoter does not necessarily correspond to transcriptional activity  <cit> . the adenovirus major late promoter  is a classical example for a tata box promoter. it contains immediately upstream and downstream of the box additional protein binding sequences, the g-rich tfiib recognition elements , which were also found in tata-less promoters  <cit> .

a tbp-like factor, tbpl <dig>  has no affinity to the tata box, but binds to other promoter elements, probably with a tbp-like function  <cit> . it was found in association with several promoters, e.g. of the pcna, the wee <dig>  the neurofibromytosis type  <dig> , the histone h <dig>  and several ribosomal protein genes  <cit> . however, no common binding motif could so far be delineated in mammals or drosophila.

geminin is a cell cycle regulatory protein, which functions through an interaction with the replication licensing factor cdt <dig>  <cit> . in addition, it was identified as a binding partner of developmental control proteins. it represses hox functions during embryogenesis by direct association with polycomb members on hox regulatory chromatin elements, and by impairing hox protein action on target genes through direct binding to the homeodomain  <cit> . in a similar way, geminin directly interacts and antagonizes the role of another homeobox protein, six <dig>  <cit> . it represses the activator function of pro-neural basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors neurogenin  <dig> and neurod on their target neuron-specific genes by sequestering brg <dig>  the catalytic subunit of the chromatin remodeling complex swi/snf  <cit> . alternatively, geminin represses neuronal gene transcription in non-neural cells through its association with the ap <dig> transcription factor, by recruiting the co-repressor smrt and histone deacetylase hdac <dig> to neuronal gene promoters  <cit> .

here, we describe the function of tipt <dig>  a protein we identified through its interaction with geminin. both geminin and tipt <dig> bind to the basic transcriptional machinery, and can activate transcription synergistically. they were found, alone or together, associated with the chromatin of specific promoters.

RESULTS
we previously identified the polycomb factor scmh <dig> and the homeodomain proteins hoxd <dig> and hoxa <dig> as geminin binding partners in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a day  <dig>  mouse embryo cdna library  <cit> . in the same screen, a strongly interacting protein was identified, encoded by a  <dig> bp, poly-tailed cdna, corresponding to the riken cdna clone 5133400g <dig> . a database entry identified the protein as isoform  <dig> of "tipt" , more recently named trf <dig> interacting protein in testis   <cit> . tipt is encoded by three differentially spliced variants, tipt isoform  <dig>  , tipt isoform  <dig>   and tipt isoform  <dig> . mammalian tipts are strongly conserved, often represented by several isoforms, but related proteins were not found in other vertebrates or drosophila. there are no similarities to other known proteins, and no conserved domain was obvious. two coiled-coil regions , known to be protein-protein interaction sites, were predicted by the simple modular architecture research tool program .

tipt <dig> expression
rna from murine tissues was analyzed by northern blotting. a transcript corresponding in length to isoform  <dig> of tipt was found in all studied tissues , with particular abundance in testis . rna from younger embryonic stages was checked for the presence of tipt <dig> mrna by rt-pcr. significant transcript levels were detected in day  <dig>  and  <dig>  embryos, and even more abundant levels in day  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  embryos . a polyclonal antibody was generated for further descriptive and functional analysis using for immunization the full-length mouse protein, cleaved from the purified e.coli recombinant gst-tipt <dig> protein with thrombin, sds-page gel-purified, and verified by mass spectroscopy . immuno-purified antibodies detected the affinity-purified tagged and untagged bacterially expressed proteins , and also the endogenous tipt <dig> from hela or u2os whole cell extract . the detection of tipt <dig> on western blots could be blocked by gst-tipt <dig> . the major protein band detected by anti-tipt <dig> antibodies in unfractionated extracts from hela, u2os and other cells, and in organ extracts from newborn mice migrated slightly slower than the calculated size of  <dig>  da . the anti-tipt <dig> antibody detected a larger sized protein band on some western blots of gel purified tipt <dig>  and of protein extracts generated from mouse organs . after transfection of plasmids encoding tagged versions of tipt <dig> the same bands were detected by anti-tipt <dig> or anti-tag antibodies . after immunoprecipitation of ha-tipt <dig> with ha antibodies the same pattern was detected by either anti-ha or anti-tipt <dig> antibodies, and mass spectroscopy indicated ha-tipt <dig> as the major precipitated protein .

in mouse embryonic stem cells, snl and nih 3t <dig> mouse fibroblasts, monkey cos- <dig>  rd rat rabdomyosarcoma, hela human cervical cancer, and u2os human osteosarcoma cells tipt <dig> was localized both in cytoplasm and nucleus, with particular enrichment in nucleoli . there, it co-localized with nucleolar markers, such as the basal transcription factor tbpl <dig>  nucleophosmin , and the  <dig>  k protein   <cit> . ha-tagged tipt <dig> co-localized in nucleoli and nucleoplasma with gfp-tbp after co-transfection of expression vectors .

tipt <dig> interacting proteins
the identification of tipt <dig> in a yeast two-hybrid screen using geminin as bait prompted the investigation of an interaction with several candidates found in the chromatin or near promoters. in vitro pull-down assays were used to ensure that tipt <dig> interacts directly with geminin . to better characterize this interaction, the geminin binding site for tipt <dig> was delineated by peptide array mapping. binding of his-geminin to tipt <dig> peptides revealed a basic amino acid rich region, close to the c-terminus of protein . indeed, a mutated gst-tipt <dig> protein  did not bind in vitro translated geminin . since geminin interacts with polycomb proteins, we checked also tipt <dig> for a potential interaction. in vitro pull-down assays indicated the binding of scmh <dig>  mph <dig>  and ring1b, but not of mel <dig> . in addition, the interaction of tipt <dig> with itself was demonstrated in vitro. the nucleolar localization of tipt <dig> and tbpl <dig>  and the above mentioned database entry prompted us to analyze a possible interaction of tipt <dig> with factors of the basal transcription machinery. in vitro, tipt <dig> interacted directly with both tbp and tbpl <dig>  and with tfiib . because geminin binds tipt <dig> and the latter binds basal transcription factors, geminin's interaction with tbp and tbpl <dig> was explored. the pull-down assay showed binding to both tbp family members, but not to tfiib . further assays were performed in order to demonstrate the interaction of bacterially synthesized gst fusion proteins with endogenous proteins of cell lysates. ponceau staining indicated equal inputs of gst proteins . from an adult testis extract, both tbp and geminin could be pulled-down with gst-tipt <dig> , and endogenous tbp could also be bound by gst-geminin. however, endogenous tipt <dig> could not be pulled-down by gst-geminin, possibly because of an inhibitory effect of the gst tag. tbp in cell lysates prepared from human u2os cells was pulled-down by both gst-tipt <dig> and gst-geminin . in order to study the in vivo interaction of tipt <dig> and tbp transfected cells were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation. anti-ha antibodies precipitated ha-tipt <dig> together with endogenous tbp from a stable, ha-tipt <dig> expressing cell line . in summary, we provide evidence that both tipt <dig> and geminin bind members of the polycomb complex as well as basal transcription factors.

tipt <dig> and tbp bind to separate dna elements
next, we analyzed whether tipt <dig> interacts with promoter sequences. in a gel shift assay, tipt <dig> bound strongly to the tata box-containing admlp . the interaction was highly specific and could be competed by cold admlp oligonucleotides, but not by high amounts of non-specific competitors . multiple bands were detected in the gel shift assay, suggesting that tipt <dig> may not only interact with dna as a monomer, but in addition more than one tipt <dig> monomer or a multimer may bind to the admlp oligonucleotide. the migration of tbp or gst-tipt <dig> bound proteins to admlp was retarded when anti-tbp, respectively anti-gst monoclonal antibodies were added to the binding reactions . an admlp oligonucleotide with a mutated tata box  was still recognized by tipt <dig>  but not by human tbp . tipt <dig> did not bind to an oligonucleotide representing the ade <dig> promoter   <cit> , to which tbp bound strongly . these data indicate that tipt <dig> does not interact with tata box sequences, and tbp requires a bona fide tata box. the admlp contains g-rich bre elements flanking the tata box  <cit> . to reveal the location of the tipt <dig> binding site, sequential mutations were introduced into the bre elements of admlp . the binding was impaired only for admlpm <dig>  where the central gg sequence of the bre upstream  element was substituted by tt . in contrary, the mutations admlpm <dig> and m4â€“m <dig> still bound directly to tipt <dig> . the binding of tipt <dig> to admlp was competed with the cold oligonucleotides admlpm2â€“m <dig>  mutants of the breu element  did not compete for admlp binding , whereas mutations in the tata box  or in the bred element  competed well for admlp binding . together, these findings emphasized the importance of the breu element, in particular its center position, for the binding of tipt <dig>  in this context potential interaction partners of tfiib were explored. in a pull-down assay we observed that tipt <dig>  but not geminin associated with tfiib .

tbp retarded significantly admlp oligonucleotides, which were clearly separated from tipt2/admlp bands . the tbp/admlp band completely disappeared when both tbp and tipt <dig> were present in the binding reaction, while the tipt2/admlp complex was maintained . more retarded oligonucleotides were observed above the tipt2/admlp dna complex, which may indicate the formation of a ternary tipt2/tbp/dna complex, but could not be defined in a clear band. when anti-tbp antibodies were added to this binding reaction, the tipt2/dna complex was still present, and even more retarded oligonucleotides were observed , possibly indicating that tipt <dig> and tbp bind independently of each other to the admlp.

tipt <dig>  tbp and geminin synergize to activate the tata box-containing promoters
we next performed transient luciferase reporter assays testing the influence of tipt <dig>  tbp and/or geminin on the adml promoter. vector encoded proteins were present in amounts similar to endogenous proteins, as demonstrated by western blots for transiently transfected gfp-tipt <dig> and fhm-tipt <dig> . transfecting in addition to tbp also tipt <dig>  tipt2m  or geminin enhanced the activation of the reporter only marginally . in comparison, the co-transfection of geminin with tipt <dig>  but not tipt2m , was much more effective . an optimal activation level  was observed in triple transfections, when tbp, tipt <dig> and geminin were introduced together. this effect was attenuated when tipt2m instead of tipt <dig> , or tbpl <dig> instead of tbp  were applied in triple transfections . replacing geminin by a mutant lacking the coiled-coil domain  did not change the synergistic effect in triple transfections, indicating that it did not result from a perturbation of the cell cycle or of dna replication. transfection of a geminin mutant lacking the binding domain for brg- <dig>  did not reduce the activity, but resulted in a slight enhancement .

similar transfection experiments were performed comparing the non-mutated adml promoter with mutants in the binding sites for either tbp  or tipt <dig> . the background level achieved with single or double transfections was slightly elevated when tipt <dig> and geminin vectors were transfected together . here, differences between the wild-type admlp reporter and reporters with a mutation in either the tipt2-binding bre element, or the tbp-binding tata box were not recognizable. double transfections did not produce a significant difference between the luciferase activities of breu mutant or tata box mutant and wild type adml promoter . maximal luciferase activities were obtained in triple transfections using the wild-type form. both the tata box and breu mutated promoters gave lower activation levels compared to the wild-type promoter .

to investigate if tipt <dig>  tbp and geminin also activated a different tata-containing promoter, the herpes virus thymidine kinase  promoter was assayed, which does not contain a bre element upstream of its tata box. still, the transfection results were quite similar to the admlp data. single transfection of tbp, tipt <dig> or geminin, as well as double transfections of tbp/tipt <dig> or tbp/geminin activated expression only marginally . triple transfections of tbp, tipt <dig>  and geminin activated the reporter very strongly  and synergistically. this effect was tbp-specific, because it could not be obtained by adding tbpl <dig> .

the indicated reporter assays were realized in the presence of endogenous tipt <dig>  geminin and tbp, all three proteins being present in the u2os cell line. we tried to knock-down endogenous tipt <dig> using various small interfering  rnas and short hairpin constructs. while tipt <dig> rna levels could be decreased more than 80%, the protein levels were not significantly affected even after several days and repeated sirna transfection . however, endogenous geminin levels could be knocked-down efficiently with specific sirna molecules . the experiments indicated that both single  and double overexpressions  were reduced in the absence of geminin . together, these results suggest that tipt <dig> synergizes with geminin and tbp in order to activate tata-containing promoters, both in the presence or absence of a tipt <dig> binding dna sequence element. we see significant, logic changes in the activation of tata promoters in response to different protein combinations. it is however apparent, that we did not necessarily observe a complete abrogation, if one factor was missing, mutated, or its binding site was removed.

association of tipt <dig> and tbpl1-tfiia with the neurofibromin promoter
recently, the binding of tbpl <dig> to a  <dig> bp fragment of the nf <dig> promoter was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . it was shown that tbpl <dig> binds to this promoter on two different sites and that tbpl <dig> shifts dna in complex with tfiia. we purified the tbpl1-tfiia complex from cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of a hela cell line stably overexpressing flag tagged tbpl <dig>  <cit> . the nf <dig> oligonucleotide was retarded significantly by this protein fraction , while geminin did not bind to it , and tipt <dig> produced bands, which however were not completely competed for by cold oligonucleotides . incubation of increasing amounts of tipt <dig> with the nf <dig> oligonucleotide in the presence of tbpl1-tfiia resulted in the appearance of a novel, slower migrating band, suggesting the binding of tipt <dig> and tbpl1-tfiia on the same oligonucleotide . an influence of geminin on the tipt2/tbpl1-tfiia/nf <dig> complex could not be demonstrated clearly by an electrophoretic mobility shift. together, these data indicate that tipt <dig> associates with tbpl1-tfiia on the tata-less nf <dig> promoter.

tipt <dig>  tbpl <dig> and geminin synergize to activate the tata-less nf <dig> promoter
we next analyzed whether tipt <dig> was able to contribute to the activation of the nf <dig> promoter by employing luciferase reporter constructs with the nf <dig> promoter, containing multiple tbpl <dig> binding sites  <cit> . tbpl <dig>  tipt <dig> or geminin alone were not capable of activating the reporter significantly . tipt <dig> and geminin together produced already a significant increase , and the additional inclusion of tbpl <dig> led to a very strong, synergistic activation . replacing tbpl <dig> by tbp revealed that the triple combination tbp/tipt2/geminin was not more active than just tipt2/geminin , indicating that nf <dig> activation was tbpl1-specific . a knock-down of endogenous geminin decreased the activity of the nf <dig> reporter in the presence of exogenous tbpl <dig> or tipt2/tbpl <dig> to levels significantly below the control background in the absence of any sirna transfected, by a factor of about  <dig>  . this result suggests that medium levels of activation in the absence of transfected geminin benefited from the presence of endogenous geminin. in summary, we show that tipt <dig>  tbpl <dig> and geminin activate the tata-less nf <dig> promoter construct synergistically.

the presence of tipt <dig> and/or geminin in specific chromatin
the chromatin of tbp or tbpl <dig> dependent genes, possessing either tata box or tata-less promoters, was assayed by chromatin immunoprecipitation  using in vivo dual-cross-linking  <cit> . for this purpose the stable u2os line generated, which produced ha-tipt <dig> at levels similar to the endogenous protein  was used. the tata box-containing regions of the investigated promoters were positive for tbp and acetylated histone h <dig> . on the hsp <dig> promoter neither tipt <dig> nor geminin were found. on the c-fos promoter geminin, but not tipt <dig>  was present in the chromatin. however, on the gapdh promoter both tipt <dig> and geminin were found. the tata-less nf <dig> promoter region that includes two tbpl <dig> binding sites was positive for acetylated h3k9k <dig>  geminin and tipt <dig>  the pcr band indicating the presence of tbp had the same intensity as for the other tata-containing promoters, but was not enriched in comparison with mouse igg. thus, it had to remain inconclusive, if tbp is present in the chromatin of the nf <dig> promoter. these results indicate that tipt <dig> and geminin are present alone or together, on the chromatin of some, but not all tested promoters.

discussion
recently, information on a second isoform of tipt  was independently reported  <cit> . these authors describe expression in male germ cells, interaction with tbpl <dig> , dna binding and association with chromatin, in line with our findings on isoform  <dig>  however, they did not detect the widespread expression we saw on the rna and protein level for isoform  <dig>  although probe and antibodies would be expected to crossreact.

in our study, we describe the synergistic function of two interacting factors, tipt <dig> and geminin, in the activation of transcription. tipt <dig> and geminin have in common that they can interact with polycomb group members , which are known for their function in the maintenance of gene repression  <cit> . therefore, it came unexpected that pcgs were found together with the basal transcriptional machinery on repressed promoters  <cit> . it lead to the hypothesis that pcg proteins maintain silencing by inhibiting general transcription factor-mediated activation of transcription by interfering with the formation of the preinitiation complex  <cit> . our findings suggest that tipt <dig> and geminin could be involved in the transition from inactive to active transcription via association with basal transcription as well as polycomb factors. we found both geminin and tipt <dig> in the chromatin of transcribed genes. tipt <dig> was significantly enriched in nucleoli, a subcellular localization shared by the bhlh transcription factor hand <dig>  the basal transcription factor tbpl <dig>  by drosophila testis-specific taf homologs and, albeit as an exception, by some pcgs  <cit> . for the nuclear geminin, on the other hand, a nucleolar localization was not specifically described. if we observe a cooperation of these proteins in pol ii-dependent transcription, their functional interactions must occur in the nucleoplasm. nucleoli might represent a site to keep transcription factors unavailable for gene regulatory functions, a hypothesis which may also apply to tipt <dig>  however, we have preliminary evidence that the nucleolar localization of tipt <dig> also reflects a role in the activation of ribosomal rna by polymerase i. in addition, our unpublished data indicate that tipt <dig> nucleolar localization is regulated by phosphorylation.

sequences flanking the core tata box can influence the assembly of complexes, affect the basal level of transcription and the response to activators  <cit> . our results show that tipt <dig> contacts the admlp on a bre site immediately upstream of the tata box, without a need for tfiib or tbp. in band-shift assays tipt2/admlp complexes run in two or more bands . the faster migrating band represents tipt <dig> associated with the breu site of the oligonucleotide. the slower band could represent more than one tipt <dig> protein per oligonucleotide, with only one monomer engaged in dna interactions. the slower migrating complex becomes more prominent than the faster complex after addition of cold oligonucleotides with breu mutations . this might be indicative of a second dna binding site on the tipt <dig> protein interacting with the competitor.

the binding of tipt <dig> to the bre site interfered significantly with the binding of tbp to the tata box. both proteins on one oligonucleotide providing both binding sites were not clearly demonstratable. but some material of lower electrophoretic mobility may indicate the formation of a triple complex, containing admlp, tipt <dig> and tbp. this disappeared upon addition of anti-tbp antibodies. chip experiments indicated that tbp and tipt <dig> could be associated in vivo with chromatin in the tata box containing promoter region of the gapdh gene. while this finding does not formally prove the simultaneous presence, it appears very unlikely that the active gapdh promoter exists in two different configurations, being occupied with either tbp or tipt <dig> 

our data suggest that transcriptional activation by tipt <dig> is optimal in the presence of a breu element , but occurs also with a mutated  breu element or in its absence . dna binding of tipt <dig> appears not to be essential, and association just by protein-protein contact seems to be sufficient. a recent bioinformatic study revealed that  <dig> % of core promoters from the epd , and  <dig> % from the dbtss , respectively contain a breu  <cit> . more precisely,  <dig> % of tata-less promoters and  <dig> % of tata-containing promoters present a breu. it is therefore conceivable that tipt <dig> plays a role in the activation of transcription from many promoters.

the tipt <dig> binding protein, geminin, activated transcription in several reporter assays. the simultaneous transfection of geminin and tipt <dig> expression vectors boosted the activation of tata-containing promoters. a mutant of tipt <dig> that could not interact with geminin was clearly less active, again underlining the importance of the geminin/tipt <dig> interaction in transcriptional activation. our results concerning adml promoter mutations analysis extends the previous findings that disruption of breu decreased activated transcription  <cit> . our data indicate that a similar mechanism for transcriptional activation could hold true in the case of the tata-less nf <dig> promoter  <cit> . mammalian tbpl <dig> does not stimulate transcription in vitro from tata box-containing e <dig>  adml and hsp <dig> promoters  <cit> . we showed here that tipt <dig>  tbpl <dig> and nf <dig> promoter form a complex in vitro. the synergistic transcriptional activation of the nf <dig> promoter by tbpl <dig>  tipt <dig> and geminin is similar to the synergistic activation we observed for the tata box-containing promoters  by tbp, tipt <dig> and geminin. it may, however, be too simplistic to correlate exclusively the tata box promoters with tbp, and the tata-less promoters with tbpl <dig>  <cit> .

down-regulation of geminin levels in human u2os cells decreased the activity obtained from activated tk and nf <dig> promoters, indicating that already the endogenous geminin plays a significant role in our transcriptional assays. geminin was reported to be involved in different, transcription-related complexes as a negative regulator of transcription, either directly or indirectly. in this study we show geminin's function as transcriptional co-activator. other studies have shown that another chromatin remodeler, the swi/snf complex, is able to act in a gene-dependent manner either as activator or repressor  <cit> . our results suggest that geminin may interact with distinct protein complexes that exhibit cell-type or gene-specific functions. these interactions may decide if geminin affects transcription as a transcriptional repressor or activator.

in agreement with in vitro and reporter assay data, the chromatin analysis revealed geminin and tipt <dig> on tata-containing and tata-less, active gene promoters. on the active endogenous chromatin, tipt <dig> and geminin were present near the tata box of the gapdh gene, but not of the c-fos or the hsp- <dig> gene on a distance of two-three nucleosomes. the active tata-less nf <dig> promoter is associated with geminin and tipt <dig> in the region where tbpl <dig> was shown to bind. our own chip evidence does not allow to conclude for the presence of tbp in the chromatin of the nf <dig> promoter in u2os cells. however, recently the presence of tbp was described in the chromatin of the nf <dig> promoter in hela cells  <cit> .

a genome-wide analysis of trf <dig> recognition sites in drosophila indicates that trf <dig>  a protein closely related to vertebrate tbpl <dig>  plays a more general role than previously thought, being required for the expression of more than  <dig>  genes, some involved in regulation of chromatin organization and cell growth   <cit> . this may suggest also that in mammals tbpl <dig> plays an important role regulating essential cell functions not only in testis, but also in other tissues. in this new perspective, our study might indicate new factors binding to both tbp and tbpl <dig>  which might constitute co-regulatory proteins common for both core promoter corresponding complexes.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we suggest that the two interacting proteins tipt <dig> and geminin function as synergistic transcriptional regulators in contact with both the basal transcriptional machinery and chromatin factors, including members of the polycomb complex.
