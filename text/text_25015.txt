BACKGROUND
honey bee, apis mellifera, provides a key model for understanding the diverse and widespread group of social insects. thanks, in part, to resources generated during the initial honey bee genome sequencing effort  <cit> , honey bees are now widely used for elucidating the molecular basis of behavior  <cit> , development  <cit> , disease transmission  <cit> , epigenomics  <cit>  and gene regulation  <cit> . honey bees are also a vital pollinator of many of the world’s crops  <cit> , and genomic tools are being used to address recent serious and unexplained declines in some honeybee populations  <cit> . in light of the current interest in honey bee genetics, improved genomic tools for this species are required.

because fewer than  <dig>  genes were predicted, one of the major questions coming out of the initial honey bee genome sequencing effort was, “where are the missing genes?” were there issues with the genome sequence that meant that the genes were filled with gaps and therefore not annotated? or were the genes located in islands of repetitive sequence and therefore not identified? were the gene prediction methods poorly adapted to a genome with a bimodal distribution in gc content? or was the tuning of gene prediction algorithms to an average gc content failing to represent genes in regions of more extreme gc content? was there insufficient mrna evidence? were the genes different enough from known genes that the prediction tools failed to find the genes due to lack of protein evidence? or might the honey bee have thousands fewer genes than the few insects with sequenced genomes at the time?

all early genome sequencing projects used sanger data and either a bac-based hierarchical-sequencing model  <cit>  or a whole-genome-shotgun model  <cit> . in either case, a completed draft genome has contiguous sequence pieces  spaced by paired clone end sequences, forming scaffolds. missing sequences between consecutive contigs are represented by segments of ambiguous bases, denoted as ns, the lengths of estimated gap sizes. few metazoan genomes have been improved to finished quality by filling in the missing sequence  <cit> . the genome scaffolds, with islands of sequence information and lack of information , are annotated with gene features using gene prediction methods. when gene signals such as splice sites, start codons and termination codons are missing from the assembly, a computational gene prediction tool may miss an exon or even an entire gene. thus, gaps within genic regions of an assembly can hinder annotation and lead to an incomplete gene list.

the first a. mellifera genome sequencing project  <cit>  revealed genome characteristics with potential missing assembly information that could impact the gene list. the genome assembly had the lowest mean gc content  and the most heterogeneous gc content of any sequenced metazoan genome at that time, with gc content ranging from 10% to 70% across the published genome assembly   <cit> . analyses of initial assemblies showed that regions with low gc content were under-represented in libraries, so additional shotgun libraries were generated after fractionating dna with cscl-bisbenzimide density gradient centrifugation, and approximately  <dig>  reads of <30% gc content were added to the data that lead to amel_ <dig>   <cit> .

in addition to potentially missing assembly information, other factors including limited est data and the large evolutionary distance between honey bee and other insects with sequenced genomes were thought to have contributed to difficulty in gene prediction. the  <dig>  a. mellifera ests that were available at the time provided only  <dig>  unique consensus sequence alignments to the genome  <cit> . the closest organisms with available protein sets were the dipterans, drosophila melanogaster and anopheles gambiae, with an estimated divergence time from honey bee  of  <dig> million years.

honey bee researchers suspected that the first official gene set , generated by creating a consensus gene set with glean  <cit> , was incomplete, as it comprised only  <dig>  genes, far fewer than expected based on the estimate of ~ <dig>  genes in d. melanogaster at the time. recently sequenced hymenoptera genomes , predicted to contain ~ <dig> - <dig>  protein-coding genes  <cit> , further support the suspicion that a large number of a. mellifera genes had not yet been detected. whole genome tiling arrays provided experimental evidence for missing genes, with the detection of signals “intergenic” to ogsv <dig>  genes  <cit> . finally, evaluation of the genome-wide distribution of ogsv <dig>  genes revealed another potential factor in computational gene prediction, which relied on algorithms optimized for gene and genome characteristics known at that time. unlike any previously sequenced metazoan genome, ogsv <dig>  genes occurred in gene regions that were more gc-poor  than the mean genome gc content , and were located in regions with gc content as low as 11%  <cit> .

genome sequencing and assembly methods have changed with the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies. newer technologies typically produce shorter reads at greatly reduced cost and allow the completion of projects with much deeper sequence coverage using many more reads than a sanger-based project. while contiguous sequence may suffer from these shorter reads that cannot span repetitive sequences, scaffolding can benefit from the increased mate-pair information. furthermore, different sequencing technologies have different biases related to nucleotide composition, so combining technologies provides the potential for one technology to fill in gaps produced by another.

a bigger impact of the reduced sequencing cost of second-generation sequencing methods is the ability to generate much more transcript sequence than ever before. these transcript data are very useful as evidence supporting gene model prediction. as will be discussed below, the alignment of new transcriptome data provided evidence for most of the previously un-annotated genes in the honey bee genome.

this paper presents a de novo annotation of the a. mellifera genome based on an upgraded genome assembly and new transcript data. we generated additional genome sequence data using abi solid and roche  <dig> paired-end sequencing technologies to superscaffold and fill gaps in the amel_ <dig>  assembly using the atlas-link software, creating the improved assembly . we also deep-sequenced the transcriptome of seven a. mellifera tissues and sequenced the genomes of two closely related species, the dwarf honey bee  and buff-tailed bumble bee  .

to avoid perpetuating errors in ogsv <dig>  and avert difficulties in tracking genes between assemblies , we chose not to track and update the previous annotation on the amel_ <dig>  assembly. instead we decided to annotate the amel_ <dig>  assembly de novo and generate a new official gene set  and a new list of repetitive elements based on the most current evidence and methodologies. to learn which factors were most important in identifying previously unknown genes, and to inform potential strategies for future genome projects, we compared both gene sets and characterized genes that were missing from ogsv <dig> .

RESULTS
improvements to the genome assembly
additional sequence coverage generated using the abi solid  <cit>  technology  and roche  <dig>  <cit>  technology  from small insert fragments  was incorporated into amel_ <dig> . the sequence data are summarized in table  <dig> and table s <dig> in additional file  <dig> and are available from the ncbi sequence read archive . we compared assembly statistics for amel_ <dig>  with the previous assembly, amel_ <dig> , which is described in  <cit>  and is the assembly used by the research community since  <dig>  the genome assembly improvements increased the contig n <dig> from 40 kb to 46 kb and the scaffold n <dig> from 359 kb to 997 kb, with an additional  <dig> % of the sequence anchored to linkage groups .

a
afor amel_ <dig>  anchored scaffolds, n <dig> was calculated separately for  <dig> oriented and  <dig> non-oriented scaffolds.

the completeness  of the new amel_ <dig>  and the earlier, amel_ <dig> , assemblies were measured by blastn comparison to available de novo assembled  <dig> contigs from seven libraries. amel_ <dig>  showed slightly more complete coverage than amel_ <dig>  .

note: blat alignments of the assembled transcripts to the genome assemblies using default parameters and counting matches of any length at 95% identity.

as hoped, the new sequence data had a large impact on the regions of the genome that were of low starting quality. while the new sequence did not specifically target the gc-poor regions of the genome that were underrepresented in the initial sanger libraries, the sequence reads were more evenly distributed across the regions of different gc contents . a segmentation analysis of amel_ <dig>  to identify gc compositional domains that are homogenous in gc content within domains, but different in gc content across domain boundaries, showed that the genomic proportion of compositional domains low in gc content increased in amel_ <dig>  . as a consequence, many newly discovered genes were annotated in gc poor regions .

generating and assessing a new official gene set

testing combined gene set approaches

we tested two approaches, maker <dig>  <cit>  and glean  <cit> , for combining outputs from multiple gene prediction tools to create an official gene set . each approach has advantages and disadvantages. an advantage of maker <dig> is that given sufficient transcript data, it can predict multiple alternative splice forms per locus, while glean computes only one gene model per locus. maker <dig> provides both a conservative biological sequence  alignment-based set of gene models that best agree with transcript and protein homolog alignments, and a set of ab initio gene predictions that do not overlap the biological sequence alignment-based set.

the final set of maker <dig> biological sequence alignment-based gene set contained  <dig>  genes, encoding  <dig>  transcripts, with an additional set of  <dig>  ab initio gene predictions that did not have support from transcript or protein alignments. without filtering the ab initio set for likely false positives, the choices of final gene sets generated with maker <dig> would have been 1) a conservative set of only  <dig>  genes, still much lower than gene numbers found in other sequenced insect genomes or 2) a set of  <dig>  genes that included ab initio gene models. other hymenoptera genome projects using maker have selected ab initio gene models with matches to interpro domains  <cit>  to include in the final predicted gene set  <cit> . this approach would allow us to add  <dig>  maker <dig> ab initio genes to the final predicted gene set, for a total of  <dig>  genes. however, since only  <dig>  of the  <dig>  maker <dig> biological sequence alignment-based genes had interpro matches, we were concerned that the interpro approach to boost ab initio genes to the final gene set would miss some rapidly diverging genes.

an important difference between glean and maker <dig> is the way ab initio predictions without biological sequence evidence are handled. glean collects evidence for genes , generates maximum likelihood estimates of accuracy and error rates for these signals for each gene prediction set, constructs consensus gene models that maximize the scores for the signal sites in each gene model, and labels each model with a probabilistic confidence score reflecting the underlying support for that gene model  <cit> . in addition to identifying consensus models supported by transcript and protein alignments, glean identifies ab initio predictions with high computed probabilities, filtering out likely false positive ab initio predictions. this approach would not require filtering ab initio predictions using an interpro search, and would potentially include high confidence ab initio predictions that are true, rapidly diverging genes without significant interpro domain matches.

since glean weighs different sources of gene prediction evidence based on agreement among sources, without a priori information on the quality of individual input gene prediction sets, the choice of input datasets impacts the results. evaluating glean runs with different combinations of input sets allowed us to determine the optimum selection of datasets. we ran glean  <dig> times with different combinations of input sets, and resulting glean sets ranged in size from in  <dig>   to  <dig>  genes , . in some cases, glean predicted a larger number of genes than the maker <dig> set supported by either biological sequence alignment or interpro. although glean generates only one transcript per gene locus, we decided to use glean to create the ogs, because we prioritized glean’s potential identification of a more comprehensive set of gene loci over maker2’s identification of  <dig> alternative transcripts. since with glean we did not need to filter ab initio genes based on interpro, it might allow the genome-conservation-based n-scan dataset to provide support for other ab initio predictions even without detectable conservation with known interpro domains. another consideration was that assembly methods for illumina rnaseq were not well established. we were concerned about the possibility of merging genes or missing introns due to potential genomic contamination in rnaseq experiments. glean uses transcript alignments to support splice predictions, but does not merge or split genes based on transcript alignments, while maker <dig> creates gene models that best agree with transcript alignments, and works best with highly reliable transcript assemblies.


selecting an official gene set

we evaluated the  <dig> glean sets based on several criteria, including overlap with a conservative evidence-based set , transcript sequences, peptides and the cegma  <cit>  conserved core set . no single gene set was optimal with respect to all criteria. we chose to rank sets based on number of peptide matches, which would prioritize completeness of a protein-coding gene set rather than correctness of gene structure.


assessing the new official gene set

the selected glean set, ogsv <dig>  , represented a significant improvement because it included  <dig>  protein-coding genes, which is  <dig>  more genes than the first official gene set, ogsv <dig> . the proportion of genes on placed scaffolds as well as those with expressed sequence coverage also increased over ogsv <dig>  . since glean predicts only coding exons, but not untranslated regions , we used maker <dig>  <cit>  to add utr to the final glean gene predictions. out of a total of  <dig>  ogsv <dig>  genes, utr were added to  <dig>  genes .

many split and merged gene models were noted when comparing the  <dig> glean sets, including ogsv <dig> , to the conservative refseq gene set . since it is difficult to computationally resolve disagreements among gene sets, the ogsv <dig>  genes in question are provided as a separate track on the beebase amel_ <dig>  genome browser  <cit> . web apollo  <cit>  annotation tools allow registered beebase users to modify gene models, and can be used to manually correct split or merged genes  <cit> .

to address the question of whether the increased gene number was due to splitting genes, we looked at the total number of coding nucleotides  and the distribution of coding sequence lengths in ogsv <dig>  and ogsv <dig> . the ranges in coding sequence lengths were 24- <dig>  and 75- <dig>  nt for ogsv <dig>  and ogsv <dig> , respectively. note that the gene prediction parameters did not allow coding sequences less than  <dig> nt for ogsv <dig> , but a minimum coding sequence parameter was not applied in the generation of ogsv <dig> ; however there were only  <dig> ogsv <dig>  genes less than  <dig> nt. the ogsv <dig>  gene with the largest coding sequence overlapped a single refseq gene prediction , and was found to be homologous to genes predicted to code for titin. the total number of coding nucleotides increased from  <dig> , <dig> in ogsv <dig>  to  <dig> , <dig> in ogsv <dig> . the increase in coding nucleotides by only  <dig> , <dig>  compared to a  <dig> % increase in the number of genes suggested that new genes were shorter and possibly a result of splitting ogsv <dig>  gene models. however, the distribution of coding sequence length in the two gene sets suggested that splitting genes was not the major source of the increased gene number . although ogsv <dig>  possessed a large number of short coding sequences  compared to ogsv <dig> , the larger genes did not appear to be missing. furthermore, analyzing overlapping gene alignments , showed that  <dig>  of the ogsv <dig>  genes did not overlap with genes in ogsv <dig> , and thus were not likely to be a result of splitting ogsv <dig>  genes.


biological evidence for the new official gene set

in assessing the gene set, we define biological evidence to include biological sequence alignments used in gene prediction pipelines  as well as matches to interpro domains and alignment to other bee genomes. we define biological gene evidence as all of the datasets considered as biological evidence, except alignment to other bee genomes, since we did not use information about genes or expression for the other bee genomes. some form of biological gene evidence supported the majority  of the ogsv <dig>  genes. an additional  <dig>  ogsv <dig>  genes aligned to either the apis florea or bombus terrestris genome for a total of  <dig>   of the ogsv <dig>  genes with biological support. requiring that transcripts be spliced reduces the number of supported genes to  <dig>   or  <dig>   if alignment of the gene to another bee genome is considered as support.

identification and characterization of new genes

identifying new genes due to improved assembly or improved gene prediction

in order to compare the old and new ogs , we mapped ogsv <dig>  coding sequences to the amel_ <dig>  assembly because it was the assembly used to predict ogsv <dig>  genes  <cit> , which were later mapped to amel_ <dig> . we chose to use amel_ <dig>  in this step, because generation of amel_ <dig>  and intermediate assemblies had involved rearranging and splitting scaffolds and incorporating unscaffolded contigs using an updated genetic map  <cit> . we wished to minimize mapping errors in our comparison of gene sets by using amel_ <dig>  to determine which ogsv <dig>  genes correspond to ogsv <dig>  genes.

we performed the mapping twice using different alignment criteria, stringent  and relaxed . we will report results only for the stringent criteria  unless otherwise specified, but have provided the relaxed mapping results in table s <dig> in additional file  <dig>  on the basis of mapping to amel_ <dig>  and overlap between the ogsv <dig>  coding sequence alignments with ogsv <dig>  gene models, we divided the  <dig>  ogsv <dig>  genes into three sub-sets . any ogsv <dig>  gene that did not align to the amel_ <dig>  assembly we deemed a “type i new” gene. any ogsv <dig>  gene that aligned to the amel_ <dig>  assembly, but whose coordinates did not overlap an ogsv <dig>  gene by a single coding base pair on the same strand, we deemed a “type ii new” gene. finally, any ogsv <dig>  gene that both aligned to the amel_ <dig>  assembly and overlapped an ogsv <dig>  gene we deemed a “previously known” gene.

genes were mapped to amel_ <dig>  assembly with stringent mapping criteria of 80% gene coverage and 95% identity. biological evidence includes transcript overlap , peptide hit, protein homolog alignment overlap, or interpro domain presence.

of the  <dig>  additional genes in ogsv <dig>  compared to ogsv <dig> ,  <dig>  genes did not overlap ogsv <dig>  genes. the other  <dig> additional genes in ogsv <dig>  were due to either splitting ogsv <dig>  genes  or to the annotation of additional recent paralogs in ogsv <dig> , and are included in the total count of  <dig> previously known genes. the  <dig> genes that did not overlap with ogsv <dig>  genes could be classified as  <dig> genes discovered due to the additional sequencing and reassembly of the bee genome for the amel_ <dig>  assembly  and  <dig>  genes detected by improved gene prediction, either through the use of new expressed sequence and protein data or improved gene prediction algorithms . we could map  <dig> additional type i new genes to the amel_ <dig>  assembly if we required only 50% of the gene to be covered , rather than the more stringent 80% gene coverage reported in table  <dig>  consistent with the amel_ <dig>  assembly being less continuous than amel_ <dig> . this lack of contiguity and resulting fragmentation of genes in the amel_ <dig>  assembly likely impaired the initial gene prediction efforts. while the frequency of genes with some form of biological support  was highest for previously known genes , most of the type i new genes  and type ii new genes  were also supported .


characteristics of new genes

we analyzed the data that went into the annotation of ogsv <dig>  and evaluated which pieces of evidence contributed to the prediction of the genes to understand why they were missed in ogsv <dig> . to determine whether genes that were not detected in ogsv <dig>  have common characteristics that make them more challenging to predict, we compared them to the previously known genes. we evaluated features such as tissue expression specificity, coding feature length, gc content, overlap of protein homolog alignments on amel_ <dig>  and the proportion of non-canonical splice sites. additional file  <dig> provides sources of evidence for each ogsv <dig>  gene.

the mean coding sequence lengths of type i new  and type ii new genes  were shorter than that of previously known genes   . this difference may be due to a higher fraction of single coding exon genes among new genes. thirteen percent of type i new genes and 31% of type ii new genes contained one coding exon, while only  <dig> % of previously known genes contained one coding exon  . the number of canonical versus non-canonical splice sites was not significantly different between the previously known and type ii new genes .

type i new genes were found to reside in gc compositional domains with mean  <dig> % gc, significantly lower than that of previously known genes  , supporting improvement in the assembly of the high-at-content regions. on the other hand, type ii new genes were found in gc compositional domains with a mean gc content of  <dig> %, higher than that of than previously known genes , but still slightly lower than the mean gc content of the genome 

the effective number of codons is an estimate of the deviation from equality of synonymous codon usage of all codons of a gene, and ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . type i new genes had a significantly lower mean effective number of codons than previously known genes,  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  respectively  . this is consistent with the idea that the more extreme the deviation from equal proportions of g + c and a + t nucleotides in coding sequences, the lower the potential diversity of synonymous codons. consistent with their locations in less extreme gc compositional domains, type ii new genes had a significantly higher mean enc than the previously known genes,  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  respectively  .


expression evidence for new genes

the majority of ogsv <dig>  genes were supported by transcript evidence. when combined, the spliced and un-spliced transcript alignments overlapped  <dig>   of ogsv <dig>  genes. an analysis of ogsv <dig>  gene coverage by transcript dataset  showed that the fraction of genes represented in a transcript dataset ranged from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  . both type i new  and type ii new  genes were less likely to overlap a spliced transcript alignment than previously known genes   .

compared to previously known genes both type i new and type ii new genes were more likely to be narrowly expressed or overlap transcript alignments from only one tissue   <dig> % of previously known,  <dig> % of type i new and  <dig> % of type ii new were narrowly expressed . conversely, previously known genes  were more likely to be broadly expressed or overlap transcript alignments from all tissues than either type i new or type ii new genes .  <dig> % of previously known,  <dig> % of type i new and  <dig> % of type ii new genes overlapped transcript alignments from all tissues. however, the fractions of narrowly expressed  and broadly expressed  genes were similar to each other for previously known genes.


homolog alignment evidence for new genes

results suggested that the use of dipteran proteins as the main source of protein homolog evidence for ogsv <dig>  may have been a contributing factor to an incomplete gene set;  <dig> % of the ogsv <dig>  genes overlapped at least one protein homolog alignment, but only  <dig> % overlapped an alignment of a d. melanogaster protein . differences among gene sets further supports the limited value of dipteran proteins as a primary source of homolog evidence for a. mellifera gene prediction. both type i new and type ii new genes were less likely than previously known genes to overlap a d. melanogaster homolog alignment . the effect was more drastic for type ii new genes; only  <dig> % of type ii new genes overlapped a d. melanogaster homolog alignment, while the proportions were  <dig> % and  <dig> % for type i new and previously known genes, respectively.

both type i new and type ii new genes were less likely than previously known genes to overlap any homolog alignment from another sequenced genome , but the difference was more extreme for type ii new genes, potentially implying that a greater number of the type ii new genes are specific to either a. mellifera, bees, or hymenoptera than the previously known genes .  <dig> % of previously known genes overlapped a homolog alignment, while only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of type i and type ii new genes, respectively, overlapped a homolog alignment .


genome alignment evidence for new genes

over 80% of the ogsv <dig>  genes aligned to both the aflo_ <dig>  and bter_ <dig>  genome assemblies . a notable difference between type ii new genes and the other gene sets was the proportion of genes that were supported by genome conservation, but not other sources of evidence. of the  <dig>  type ii new genes supported by any evidence,  <dig> % were not supported by other sources. on the other hand, only  <dig> % of supported type i new genes and 1% of supported previously known genes were supported by only genome conservation.

the remaining 20% of the ogsv <dig>  genes have the potential to be apis-specific  or a. mellifera specific  .

peptide analysis

use of peptide evidence

peptide data were used in four ways. first, peptide data were used in gene prediction by augustus, the only program used in this study that accepts this source of gene evidence. second, peptides were compared to all consensus gene prediction sets to identify the set with the highest representation of peptides . third, peptide support was used in characterizing previously known, type i and type ii new genes. fourth, venom peptides were used to manually annotate venom genes associated with the sting of the honey bee.


gene set comparison with all peptides

peptide sequences aligned to a greater number of previously known genes than to type i or type ii new genes . peptides aligned to 32% of the previously known genes, but to only 17% of type i and 2% of type ii new genes .


venom peptide analysis

despite the lower proportion of new genes compared to previously known genes with peptide matches, analysis of venom peptides  showed that the amel_ <dig>  assembly provides a significant contribution to venom proteome research.  <dig> unique venom peptides provided biological evidence for  <dig> genes . searching the venom mass spectra against ogsv <dig>  and ogsv <dig>  showed that the improved assembly allowed detection of  <dig> additional peptides supporting  <dig> new venom protein identifications in ogsv <dig>  . additional tryptic peptides were discovered for  <dig> venom proteins as a result of improved gene predictions .

manual annotation of genes supported by the venom peptides  using apollo  <cit>  showed that most honey bee venom genes are fully  or partially  covered by transcriptome evidence. the putative biological functions of these genes are described elsewhere  <cit> . we discovered that one of the annotated genes  codes for tertiapin. while the tertiapin peptide was already found in bee venom  <cit> , no genomic or transcriptomic evidence had been described, an issue which is now solved as the genome improvement project supplies both a gene prediction  and est evidence . the gene is positioned on linkage group  <dig>  next to the apamin and mast cell degranulating peptide venom genes. the three genes are tandemly arranged which suggest their origin by gene duplication via unequal crossing over, and may also point to a joint control of transcription  <cit> .

orthology assessment
analysis of two different a. mellifera gene sets in comparison to genes from other insects allowed us to investigate the impact of the new genome and gene annotations on the numbers of a. mellifera genes in near-universal orthologous groups. although true gene losses can and do occur, these near-universal insect orthologous groups highlight possible missed gene annotations in each species.

numbers of orthologs were counted for each of the two sets, v <dig>  and ogsv <dig> . figure  <dig> and table s <dig> in additional file  <dig> show the near-universal orthologs missing in each genome. the pea aphid  was found to be missing more orthologous groups than the other insects. the a. mellifera v <dig> annotation was average for the genomes analyzed , but the ogsv <dig>  annotation was much more complete, missing fewer orthologs  than the other genomes. thus, the new gene set ogsv <dig>  reduced the total number of potentially missing orthologs in a. mellifera by 57%, demonstrating the annotation improvement that recovered more “universal” insect orthologs than the previous one did.

predicted gene functions

gene ontology analysis

gene ontology analysis  showed enrichment of some specific functions in new genes. type i new genes were enriched for the biological processes “apoptosis” , “neurotransmitter release” , and “secondary active organic cation transmembrane transporter” . the detection of these type i new genes due to new assembly data is likely due to their location in low gc content regions, which were underrepresented in the older assembly; this is in agreement with the lower mean gc content of gc compositional domains containing type i new genes. type ii new genes were enriched for the molecular function “nuclease activity” . rapidly evolving and single exon genes are more difficult to annotate automatically, so it is perhaps not surprising that we found significant differences in some activities.


interpro analysis

comparison of interpro protein domains found in ogsv <dig>  and ogsv <dig>  proteins showed that  <dig> of the interpro domains present in ogsv <dig>  were not present in ogsv <dig>  . there were also significant differences in the fraction of genes with the domains ipr <dig>  and ipr <dig> . there were  <dig> and  <dig> genes with olfactory receptor domains in ogsv <dig>  and ogsv <dig> , respectively. olfactory receptor genes contain a single olfactory receptor domain, so the domain count corresponds to the gene count. the additional olfactory receptor genes were found among both the type i and type ii new genes. the family of olfactory receptor genes is expanded in hymenopteran insects, with rapidly diverging family members that are often arranged in tandem arrays  <cit> . many of the  <dig> known a. mellifera olfactory receptor genes were identified by manual annotation of the previous assembly, because they were not found in ogsv <dig>   <cit> . improved computational prediction of olfactory receptors in the new assembly was likely due to increased assembly continuity which would improve identification of tandemly repeated genes, and new sources of biological sequence alignment evidence  which improve identification of rapidly diverging genes.

there were  <dig> and  <dig> genes with transposase type  <dig> domains in ogsv <dig>  and ogsv <dig> , respectively. thirteen of the additional transposase type 1domains were in type  <dig> new genes. transposases are associated with transposable elements, which are a class of interspersed repeats. since the new assembly information filled in gaps, and gaps in de novo assemblies are found where the assembly process fails to find an unambiguous path , we were not surprised to identify interpro domains associated with repetitive sequences among the type i new genes. predicted genes with matches to transposable element domains are often removed from gene sets. we further investigated ogsv <dig>  for presence of interspersed repeats, and decided not to remove the small number of genes associated with transposable element domains, because evidence suggested that some were real host genes .

genome-wide repeat analysis
processing the amel_ <dig>  assembly with the repet pipeline yielded  <dig>  de novo predicted repetitive elements, of which  <dig>  were validated by annotation of at least one complete copy. in total  <dig> %  of the genome appears to be repetitive . non-interspersed repeats  accounted for  <dig> % , whereas interspersed repeats represented  <dig> %  of the amel_ <dig>  assembly. the latter estimate for transposable elements is similar to a previous estimate of 3%  <cit> , whereby only mariner and r <dig> elements were reported. thus the honey bee remains a species with an unusually low amount of repetitive dna.

dpotential host genes were predicted by software using dna characteristics, not by overlap analysis with gene predictions. an example of a potential host gene element is a coding sequence for a repeated protein domain or motif.

most of the groups of retrotransposable elements were detected in the genome of the honey bee. in comparison to many other organisms, the most striking difference is the extremely low diversity and abundance of these elements. ltr retrotransposons accounted for only  <dig> % of the genome  and included examples from only one copia and a putative, unclassified element. only fragments of elements from the belpao and gypsy superfamily were found. the dirs group was represented by two incomplete elements and accounted for  <dig> % of the genome . lines accounted for only  <dig> % of the genome , and were represented by only two r <dig> elements, one i  element, and a few fragments, potentially belonging to i  and jockey . of the sine elements detected,  <dig> could not be classified and five had similarities to sines of the 5s type, all representing  <dig> % of the genome . together with another unclassified element, all class i retroelements summed up to only 224 kb  of the genome, among the lowest in the animal kingdom. trims   <cit>  and lards   <cit>  are derivatives of retroelements and were detected in larger number occupying  <dig>  mb  of the genome .

class ii dna transposons were more frequent and accounted for  <dig> % of the genome . the vast majority of the elements were tir  transposons of the mariner superfamily . otherwise only two elements of the piggybac superfamily  and five unclassified tir elements could be detected. other types of dna transposons, crypton, maverick and helitron could not be found. the dna transposon derivatives, mites , were found only once and accounted for less than  <dig> % of the genome  .

besides the well-classified sequences, many repetitive elements could not be assigned to a superfamily or even class. the latter includes a larger number of elements , which could represent novel types, but need further investigation. we separately annotated and excluded from the transposable element counts elements that could not be categorized and elements without typical transposable element features that contained profiles from protein coding genes. both together comprise  <dig> %  of the genome .

the detected elements of the r <dig> and the majority of those of the mariner type belonged to or were very similar to previously described elements from a. mellifera or other insects . a few other mariner and the piggybac elements showed similarities to elements known from distant animal species. this indicates a potential horizontal gene transfer as previously suggested  <cit> .

most of the elements appeared to be fragmented and incomplete. although some contained sequences of typical transposable element protein domains, they seemed to be inactive due to stop codons and frameshift mutations. we detected only four retrotransposons and  <dig> dna transposons with rt  or tase  domains, respectively. none of the retrotransposons appeared to possess an active orf containing an entire rt domain, so we classified them as inactive. among the dna transposons, six of the mariners appeared to be complete and two were potentially active. five additional mariner elements possessed an intact orf spanning at least parts of a tase domain, so they might have limited activity. the higher abundance and higher number of chimeric inserts of mariners  suggests that transposons were more recently active than retrotransposons.

repeats associated with the official gene set
since gene annotation had been performed on an assembly that was masked for repeats early in the project, prior to the availability of results from the genome-wide repeat analysis, we expected some ogs genes to overlap newly-detected repeats due to incomplete masking. coding sequences of  <dig>  genes overlapped interspersed repeats detected by repet. these genes were further investigated for characteristics that would support their annotation as host genes, including whether the gene was previously known, had multiple coding exons, overlapped a spliced transcript alignment, and had interpro domain matches . of these  <dig>  repet-overlapping genes,  <dig> were classified as previously known,  <dig> as type i new genes, and  <dig> as type ii new genes.  <dig>  of the repet-overlapping genes had multiple exons and  <dig> overlapped spliced transcript alignments.

inspecting interpro results to identify protein domains known to be associated with transposable elements, but not host genes, resulted in the following list of domains: dde superfamily endonuclease; integrase, catalytic core; reverse transcriptase, rna-dependent dna polymerase; retrotransposon, pao; ribonuclease h domain; ribonuclease h-like domain; transposase, tc1-like; transposase, type 1; transposase, synechocystis pcc  <dig>  of the  <dig> repet-overlapping genes that had interpro matches, only  <dig> matched one of these transposable element domains. some protein domains, such as zinc fingers, peptidases and helicases, are similar between host genes and transposable elements, so cannot be used to classify genes as transposable elements. among the genes that matched non-transposable element domains were some known to be members of large gene families, such as olfactory receptors, and genes with repetitive domains, such as ankyrin repeat-containing domains. we were not surprised that these would be included in a set of de novo detected repeats.

of the  <dig> genes with transposable element domain matches,  <dig> had other domains suggesting they could be host genes, and  <dig> overlapped spliced transcript alignments. only four genes with either transposable element or unknown/uncharacterized domain family matches lacked evidence of being a host gene. that is these four genes had a single coding exon, lacked spliced transcript overlap and had no other interpro domain match. we chose not to remove from the ogs genes that overlapped repeats detected by repet or genes that matched interpro transposable element domains, because of evidence supporting a large number of them as host genes, and the possibility that transposable elements may have contributed to the evolution of some host genes .

discussion
in the approximately seven years that have elapsed between generation of ogsv <dig>  and ogsv <dig> , new sequence was added to the assembly; new sequencing technologies, genome assembly methods and gene prediction methods were applied; and new sources of gene prediction evidence became available. several lines of evidence indicate that the new assembly is more complete. these include improved continuity of scaffolds, increased coverage of low gc content regions of the genome, identification of  <dig> new genes that do not align to the older assembly, and increased number of detectable repetitive elements. the upgraded assembly allowed us to conduct a comprehensive analysis of repetitive elements in the genome, create an improved gene set and confirm previous findings related to gc composition. it also allowed us to confirm that low amounts of transposable elements and repetitive dna are bona fide features of the honey bee genome, and not artifacts of incomplete assembly and annotation.

transposable elements can be a major factor in genome and gene evolution. previous analyses found a low number of transposons and retrotransposons in the assembled genome compared to other sequenced insect genomes  <cit> , but researchers questioned whether additional elements were present in unassembled portions of the genome. the upgraded assembly allowed us to better characterize repetitive elements in the genome. despite a more comprehensive repetitive element annotation, the genomic coverage of transposable elements was extremely low, most striking for the retrotransposons, in agreement with the previous analyses. the most apparent difference between a. mellifera and other hymenopteran insects is the relative lack of retrotransposable elements; genomes of other bee, wasp, ant and insect species all contain higher proportions  <cit> . although comparisons across studies are difficult due to methodological differences, our results show that the total fraction of repetitive dna in the a. mellifera genome  is lower than that of most other sequenced hymenoptera genomes. some of the ant genomes have more than twice as much repetitive dna  and the genome of the parasitoid wasp, nasonia vitripennis, contains more than three times the amount   <cit> . the ants camponotus floridanus and pogonomyrmex barbatus are more similar to a. mellifera, with estimates of 15% and 9%, respectively  <cit> . however, those analyses did not include lard, trim and mite elements, which make up a considerable fraction of the repetitive elements in a. mellifera . without these derivative elements, a. mellifera would possess well less than 1% transposable elements. this extraordinarily low proportion of mobile elements suggests that evolutionary processes molding the a. mellifera genome differ from processes working on other hymenopteran genomes, even though many of the species listed above are also insects with eusocial lifestyles.

combined with new biological evidence for gene predictions, the upgraded assembly allowed for significant improvement to the a. mellifera gene set, with >50% more genes. the identification of  <dig> additional interpro domains and the 57% reduction in number of missing universal insect orthologs indicate a more comprehensive catalog of protein functions. the presence of nine new venom protein genes, the detection of new tryptic peptides in existing venom protein genes, and the 53% increase in the number of computationally identified olfactory receptor domains are examples of more comprehensive annotation of specific gene families important to bee biology enabled by the improved genome.

the previously described a. mellifera genome characteristics of low and heterogeneous gc content  <cit>  remain after the addition of new sequence to the assembly. expansion and improvement of the low gc content regions in the new amel_ <dig>  assembly was supported by the identification of type i new genes, which were found in regions of lower gc content than that of previously known genes. while it is impossible to know whether new gene prediction evidence  affected the ability to predict the type i new genes, the identification of type ii new genes in regions with slightly higher gc content than previously known genes suggested that the addition of new gene evidence had a greater impact on gene prediction in higher gc regions. although any single evidence type was less frequent in the type ii new genes, the total number of type ii new genes supported by the evidence  was higher than that of type i new genes . higher recombination rates  <cit>  and rates of molecular evolution in high gc content regions of the a. mellifera genome  <cit>  may have contributed to sequence divergence that made type ii new genes difficult to detect when generating ogsv <dig> . high gc content regions have been shown to be enriched in genes associated with behavioral traits  <cit> , suggesting that some type ii new genes may be associated with important bee-specific traits.

despite the higher mean gc content of regions containing type ii new genes, the strong bias for a. mellifera genes to reside in low gc content regions relative to the genome  <cit>  remains. among the wide range of insect genomes we have examined thus far, only the hymenopterans a. mellifera and h. saltator show a strong bias for genes to occur in compositional domains with low gc content, although s. invicta, p. barbatus, l. humile and n. vitripennis show a slight bias  <cit> . the biological meaning of this, and whether this is related to the lifestyles of these hymenopterans, is still unclear.

comparisons of the old and new gene sets suggested that short and single coding exon genes, with spatially- or temporally-restricted expression patterns and low protein homology remain difficult genes to predict. compared with previously known genes, type ii new genes were more rarely and narrowly expressed, had shorter coding sequences, were more likely to be single coding exon genes, and were less likely to have detectable homologs. the characteristics of type ii new genes were consistent with those of new genes identified in the modencode effort to reannotate the developmental transcriptome of drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . their “new transcribed regions”  in drosophila also had low expression levels with temporally restricted patterns. in addition more than half of these ntrs were single-exon genes, and the multi-exon ntrs were shorter and less conserved than previously annotated genes  <cit> . while difficulty in computational identification of functional small open-reading frames  has led to their low representation in genome annotations, increasing evidence supports functional smorfs in eukaryotes  <cit> .

efficient and effective annotation methods for non-model organisms has become critical in a time when initiatives such as i5k  and g10k  motivate scientists to investigate genomes of diverse organisms, many of which will be evolutionarily distant from existing model organisms. our results suggest that investigators wishing to comprehensively annotate protein-coding genes in genomes of non-model organisms should invest in transcriptome sequencing that is both deep and broad, similar to findings in re-annotation of the green anole lizard  genome  <cit> . type ii new genes were more likely to be narrowly expressed, so transcript evidence from only a single tissue may have missed a high proportion of the expressed genes. transcriptome sequence from multiple tissues, life stages and conditions may be more useful than protein homolog evidence; the number of type ii new genes with transcript evidence exceeded the number of those with protein homolog evidence, despite the relatively close evolutionary distance between a. mellifera and some of the reference species, which included six species within the order hymenoptera. even with sampling many transcriptomes, rarely expressed genes can be missed, and genomic sequence from closely related species can aid gene prediction by leveraging nucleotide sequence conservation; our analysis showed that  <dig> of the ogsv <dig>  genes were supported by genome conservation as their only source of biological evidence. as more genomes are sequenced and annotated, gene prediction should become easier. when expression and homolog evidence are lacking, it is important to train ab initio prediction algorithms using genes representing the true distribution of gene features such as coding sequence and exon length, codon usage and gc content. our analysis of type i and type ii new genes suggests that the bimodal distribution of genome gc content in a. mellifera results in at least two classes of genes distinguished by different distributions of gc content and codon usage. ab initio gene predictors may benefit by training with coding sequences from each class separately.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that next generation sequencing followed by de novo annotation can substantially improve an unfinished first generation genome sequence assembly and annotation. the upgraded assembly and annotation allowed us to confirm that the honey bee genome contains a typical number of genes relative to other insects. the improved honey bee gene set will be invaluable to the honey bee research community in efforts to elucidate the mechanisms behind fundamental biological processes, such as evolution of insect eusociality, as well as agricultural issues, such as pollinator health and immunity. furthermore, understanding the reasons genes were not predicted in ogsv <dig>  will lead to more effective gene prediction strategies for new genome projects.
