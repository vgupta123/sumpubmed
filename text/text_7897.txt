BACKGROUND
grain hardness is an important factor of cereal quality influencing the end use of common wheat  <cit> . it has a strong effect on milling properties, flour granularity and starch granule integrity. soft wheat contains high levels of both puroindoline proteins, puroindoline a  and puroindoline b , which form friabilin  <cit> . these small proteins are unique among plant proteins, having a cysteine-rich backbone and tryptophan-rich domain  <cit> . their lipid-binding properties influence dough quality  <cit>  as well as plant resistance to pathogens  <cit> . puroindoline-like proteins  <cit>  in triticale are named secaloindoline a and secaloindoline b  <cit> . the function of sin genes coding secaloindoline proteins is not well characterized.

hexaploid triticale  is a synthetic crop developed from hybridization of durum wheat , reproducing very hard type grains with very soft type grains rye . it exhibits a high level of variation for grain hardness  <cit> . thus this species is very interesting to investigate the mechanism of grain hardness. as a hybrid of wheat and rye, it combines the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance  conditions of rye. it is grown mostly for forage or fodder, although some triticale cultivars are grown for bread or are components of health food products.

sina and sinb genes in triticale  are orthologs of pina and pinb in wheat . both species are allohexaploids containing the a, b and r or a, b and d genomes, respectively. the sin genes are located in the hardness locus of 5r  <cit>  and the pin genes in the hardness locus of 5d  <cit> . the well-documented, main role of pin genes in wheat is to control grain hardness . specific mutation or rnai silencing of both pin genes decreased the level of puroindolines and increased grain hardness up to the level of hard t. turgidum var. durum cultivar  <cit> . the function of their orthologs, sin genes in triticale, is expected to be similar; however, a few papers on the subject have reported contradictory data  <cit> . the first report on the conservation of pina and sina sequences reported that the homology is more than 99%, but sina sequences were not found  <cit> . no pcr product was amplified with pina specific primers in rye and triticale, but the authors documented discrete allelic variation at the secaloindoline loci in rye. ramirez et al.  <cit>  demonstrated the occurrence of a product of sin genes, friabilin, but there was no correlation between the content of the starch-granule associated friabilin-like protein and grain hardness . li et al.  <cit>  detected genes orthologous to puroindoline b and found that the level of starch granule-associated friabilin, which is the final product of the genes, was high in soft triticale lines and very low in hard lines. however, two newly found alleles containing substituted amino acids did not influence the phenotype. no relationship between grain hardness and secaloindoline alleles have been reported in rye, since all tested genotypes displayed a soft phenotype  <cit> .

rnai  technology is a great tool for silencing of native gene expression as well as for analysis of gene function and obtaining modified plants. the technology is especially useful in the case of polyploid cereals, such as wheat  <cit>  or triticale, for which all homologous genes and their copies might be silenced. application of rnai technology is possible with the well-established genetic transformation method. we have already proved that for silencing of developmentally regulated genes agrobacterium-mediated transformation is the method of choice, compared with the biolistic one  <cit> . based on conclusions from our research and earlier documented preferences for cereal transformation  <cit> , agrobacterium-mediated transformation of triticale, first established by us  <cit> , was applied in the present research.

as previously documented, the rna-mediated silencing of one of the pin genes in wheat simultaneously decreased the expression of the other, which resulted in a significant increase of grain hardness  <cit> . this is the first report on the rnai silencing of their orthologs, sin genes in triticale, with the aim of explaining their function. we proved the possibility of using rnai technology in another hexaploid cereal species. opposite to wheat, no negative correlation between very low expression level and increase of grain hardness was documented. the silencing was transmitted to the t <dig> kernel generation.

RESULTS
sequence comparison of novel sina and sinb alleles from cv. wanad to other known sin and to pina and pinb of wheat and their expression profiles
full coding sequences of sin genes of the wild plants of cv. wanad were amplified with specific primers and sequenced. comparison of sina from cv. wanad  with two known sina sequences from secale cereale revealed  <dig> nucleotide substitutions and  <dig> nt insertions in one allele   <cit>  and only  <dig> nt substitutions in the second one   <cit> . the sinb sequence from cv. wanad was deposited in genbank under accession number kc <dig>  two other accessions, ay <dig>  and ay <dig>   <cit> , differ to sinb in one codon deletion and three or four nucleotide substitutions. the accession dq <dig>   <cit>  revealed four nucleotide substitutions .

alignment/homology matrix with wheat pina-d1a  and pinb-d1a  alleles showed 95% and 93% homology to sina  and sinb  coding sequences of the tested triticale cultivar. each ortholog contained at least  <dig> long fragments showing 100% homology:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> nucleotides for sina and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides for sinb. deduced amino acid sequences showed  <dig> % and 90% homology with pina  and pinb  respectively. dna sequence alignment of pina-d1a  and pina-d1a sequenced from wheat cvs. kontesa and torka with sina of cv. wanad revealed  <dig> substitutions and  <dig> deletions. it corresponds with  <dig> amino acid substitutions and one amino acid deletion. dna sequence alignment of pinb-d1a , pinb-d1c sequenced from cv. kontesa and torka with sina of cv. wanad showed  <dig> substitutions and one insertion of three nucleotides .

expression profiles of sin genes in developing spikes from  <dig> dap to  <dig> dap of wild type plants of cv. wanad were determined . the relative level of sina transcript was growing up to  <dig> dap and the peak was  <dig> times higher compared to  <dig> dap. the transcript of sinb started to accumulate from  <dig> dap up to  <dig> dap, reaching  <dig> times higher expression compared to  <dig> dap. there was a respective decline of profiles of both genes from  <dig> dap to  <dig> dap. the profiles were parallel to each other, with a 20% to 30% lower transcript level of sinb compared with sina.

silencing of sin genes in transgenic lines through generations
the decrease of transcript level in silenced plants was determined in  <dig> dap spikes by quantified rt-pcr. it was measured in  <dig> plants of each of 8 t <dig> lines transformed with the  cassette and 2 t <dig> lines transformed with the  cassette. relative level of expression was related to non-silenced, control plants , which were transformed with the empty pmcg <dig> vector. the transcript level for sina ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and for sinb from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the highest level of silencing, reaching about 80% decrease of transcript, was observed in the individual plants of segregating t <dig> lines: 6a, 12a, 29a, 30a, and 31a. the lowest mean rate of both sin transcripts was about  <dig>  in line 29a. the levels of silencing for both sin genes were similar and independent of the silencing cassette used.

individual t <dig> plants showing in most cases the lowest transcript levels were selected to test the segregation and the level of silencing in the t <dig> generation. there were  <dig> lines silenced with  and four silenced with  . the range of silencing for the sina gene was from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and for sinb from  <dig>  to  <dig> . most of the individual t <dig> plants were silenced and the transcript was reduced up to 99%. the level of silencing of both genes was similar, independent of the silencing cassette used. the highest differences in the levels of expression among individual plants were observed in 2e <dig> and 6a <dig> lines. similar levels of expression were observed among plants of 2j <dig>  7f <dig> and 37a <dig> lines. in most t <dig> lines  the mean level of transcript was lower than in the parent t <dig> plant.

as expected, individuals from lines of the t <dig> generation showed very low transcript levels for both sin genes, similar among the plants of the lines . it was below  <dig>  in most of the tested lines as well as their t <dig> parents. only in the case of 2e1- <dig> parents did the levels of sin expression differ significantly from the levels of sin for their progeny.

data of mean relative transcript level of sina and sinb for all tested individuals calculated for t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> generations  showed a significant decrease up to  <dig> . independent of the silencing cassette  or , the level of silencing of sina was similar to the level of silencing of sinb. transcripts of both silenced genes were lower by about 40% in t <dig> generations, about 70% to 80% in t <dig> generations, and about 90% in t <dig>

the protein contents of secaloindoline bands  was identified by mass spectrometry and compared with a protein sequence database using mascot search engine    <cit> . the highest scores of protein identity and number of significant matches > <dig> were obtained for deposited by us in genbank sina from triticale cv. wanad ; three others were pina from aegilops sharonensis , pina from pseudoroegneria spicata  and pinb from secale cereale . two more puroindoline-like b with lower scores and significant matches were from dasypyrum villosum and aegilops umbellulata. the rest of proteins were dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitors from different species of triticum and aegilops speltoides. according to genebank regions 36– <dig> of sina and 39– <dig> sinb are named as aai_ss: alpha-amylase inhibitors  and seed storage  protein subfamily. they are composed of cereal-type aais and ss proteins  <cit> . additionally both proteins contain two more sites: polypeptide binding for dimer interface order and alpha-amylase binding site order. tryptophan-rich domain of sina is fpvtwqwwkwwkg and differ from wild-type of pina-d1a allele protein of t. aestivum by one amino acid . the same domain of pinb is fpvtwptrwwkg and differ from wild-type pina by one amino acid .

the hardness index and related traits
the grain hardness index and other characteristics, such as weight, moisture, and seed diameter, were determined using the single kernel characterization system in two experiments. in the first one, 6 t <dig> plants transformed with  and 6 t1/t <dig> plants transformed with  were compared with control plants . the hardness index ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in silenced plants and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in controls. correlation coefficient between hardness and transcript level for sina was  <dig>  and for sinb was  <dig> . hardness index was positively correlated with transcript level of sin genes.

in the second one,  <dig> progeny plants from  <dig> silenced with  t2/t <dig> lines and  <dig> progeny plants from  <dig> silenced with  t2/t <dig> lines were tested. means for these data including total seed protein content are shown in table  <dig>  the hardness index ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in silenced plants and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in controls. the mean values of the hardness index were lower in two groups of transgenic lines showing significantly decreased transcript levels. the hardness index in control, not silenced lines was  <dig> , in lines silenced with  it was  <dig> , and in lines silenced with  it was  <dig> . the mean relative transcript levels of sina and sinb in the same group of lines were  <dig>  and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. additionally, the total seed protein content of silenced lines was significantly lower compared with control lines. it was  <dig> % for control and  <dig> % or lower for silenced lines. there were no differences in weight or diameter of the seeds between the silenced lines and controls. the correlation coefficient between hardness and transcript level in the second group of plants for sina was  <dig>  and for sinb was  <dig> . hardness index was weakly positively correlated with transcript level of sin genes.

discussion
alignment of newly isolated sina and sinb from cv. wanad with the few known from genbank sin alleles of s. cereale revealed a few differences including single nucleotide substitutions and codon deletion or insertion. this comparison also showed that sin alleles are more variable among themselves than pin alleles, which frequently differ in only one nucleotide  <cit> . in wheat even single point mutation leading to a small differences in amino acid sequence might have an immense impact on wheat hardness  <cit> . it might change structure of the protein including conformation of tryptophan-rich domain, what have an impact on lipid-binding properties and wheat kernel hardness [reviewed in  <cit> . otherwise, until now no relationship between polymorphism of sin genes and grain hardness in rye or triticale has been reported  <cit> . however discrimination of soft and hard genotypes of triticale, which correlated with the level of starch granule-associated friabilin was presented  <cit> . experimental, wild-type wanad cultivar was classified as soft/medium-soft phenotype, accumulating high levels of sin proteins.

wheat pina-d1a  and pinb-d1a  alleles showed 95% and 93% homology with sina and sinb coding sequences of the tested triticale cultivar. each ortholog contained several long, exceeding  <dig> nt 100% homologous fragments. this feature allowed us to apply the same, hprna type of silencing cassette, which has already been successfully used for silencing of pin genes in wheat  <cit>  to silence sin genes in triticale.  contained the whole coding sequence of pina-d1a in sense and antisense orientation;  contained the respective pinb-d1a sequences, both 447 bp long. according to the process of rnai silencing by hprna constructs, short interfering rna , which could repress the expression of the target genes, are  <dig>   <dig> or 24 bp long . the degradation of the expressed silencing construct might lead to the formation of several different sirna, which could repress expression of the target genes.

high coding sequence homology of sin with their orthologous pin genes was coupled with high, more than 90% amino acid homology. products of pin, puroindoline a and puroindoline b  <cit> , and products of sin alleles, secaloindoline a and secaloindoline b, were abundant in wild type cultivars, which gave a good opportunity to test silencing of the genes by rnai.

temporal expression patterns of both sin genes in wild type plants of triticale cv wanad during kernel development were parallel, with slightly lower relative values of the transcript for sinb and with the peak at  <dig> dap for both genes. this peak of transcript accumulation indicated the best phase of kernel development to measure the level of gene silencing in silenced lines. the highest relative values of sina was about  <dig> times higher and for sinb  <dig> times higher compared with the first measurement at  <dig> dap. similar expression profiles were observed for pina and pinb in two wheat cultivars  <cit> . these data are also consistent with starch and gluten accumulation patterns  <cit>  as it was presented by pauly et al.  <cit> .

fourteen transgenic lines transformed with the silencing cassette for sina silencing and two for sinb were selected after agrobacterium-mediated transformation. as was already documented in the case of gene silencing  <cit>  as well as transgene expression  <cit> , this method should be the method of choice. segregation of silencing was observed among progeny of all tested t <dig> lines documenting high efficiency of the rnai silencing process. similar to silencing of pin genes in wheat  <cit> , both sin genes were silenced at a similar level independent of the silencing cassette used. this feature is not explained by long rnai trigger size and high homology of sina and sinb. the putative hairpin precursors  from both silencing cassettes did not form short interfering rna  21– <dig> nt long, which could repress the expression of both genes.

selection of silent siblings up to the fourth generation resulted in a uniform level of silencing among t <dig> progeny of most of the sublines. the level of silencing of sin genes measured by qrt-pcr was up to 99%, and was even several percent lower than in the case of pin genes in wheat  <cit> . the reported expression of other silent genes in wheat relative to the control ranged from 10% to 80%  <cit> . comparison of expression to other alleles/mutants of sin in rye, secale cereale or triticale genotypes was impossible because of the lack of such studies. this high level of silencing of sin and pin genes might be the result of the main advantage of rnai technology, which is the possibility to silence all homologous or orthologous genes as well as additional copies of the genes  <cit> . as reported by wilkinson et al.  <cit> , additional variants of pinb existed in part as a homologous series on the long arm of chromosome 7a. these variants, renamed as pinb- <dig> series as well as novel variants found were mapped on chromosomes 7d, 7b and 7a  <cit> . expression of these variants and their impact on grain texture was also reported  <cit> . triticale shares with wheat two of three genomes, a and b, where all the orthologs to sina and sinb might be silenced. simultaneous silencing of orthologs or homologs of sin might determine that the level of rnai silencing would always exceed the decrease of transcript in mutant or even in lack-of-function genotypes.

silencing of sin genes resulted in low or almost lack of products, secaloindoline a and secaloindoline b. the most unexpected result of sin silencing was the lack of correlation between low expression level of silent genes and increased grain hardness as was observed in wheat  <cit> . moreover, correlation coefficients indicated a weak positive relationship between decrease of the transcripts and decrease of the hardness. taking into account that generally there is no grain hardness variation in rye, our results may suggest that grain hardness in triticale is not related to sin genes and other factors might control this trait in both mentioned species. however, without knowledge about allelic variations of sin genes in both rye and triticale we cannot draw clear conclusions. the hardness index was measured by the skcs method, which is the current reference method for determination of kernel texture for wheat  <cit> . the same method was used for grain hardness measurement and classification in  <dig> triticale lines  <cit> . good correlation was also been found between skcs and psi  method of hardness measurement in barley  <cit> . the values ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> in the silent triticale lines and from  <dig> to  <dig> in the control, and the mean values were lower in the silent ones, proving increase of softness. smaller sample sizes used in our experiment might give some skewed results, however the skcs data indicate general trend of hardness. decrease of expression of sin genes was correlated with lower secaloindoline a and secaloindoline b content, influencing the total seed protein content, which was significantly lower compared with control lines. opposite to triticale, the total seed protein content in silenced lines of wheat was the same as in controls . this might indicate that the lack of puroindolines in wheat was offset by other proteins and in triticale not. the range of grain hardness measured using skcs for  <dig> hexaploid triticale lines ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . opposite to our results, the authors reported that all soft lines contained a high level of friabilin. consistent with the function of grain hardness pin genes in wheat was also the role of hin genes in barley. the mutation in these genes resulted in an increase in grain hardness  <cit> . however, in another report low variation in grain hardness of a broad range of barley breeding lines and commercial varieties was documented  <cit> .

the identities of secaloindoline a and secaloindoline b bands on the gel were proved by mass spectrometry and comparison with a protein sequence database using mascot search engine. both sina and sinb from triticale cv. wanad showed the highest percent of identity with sina and sinb from soft grain cultivars of s. cereale, what might suggest their functionality. the rest of identified puroindolines belong to different species of triticeae or were identified as cereal-type aais and ss protein subfamily – regions existing in the sin proteins. they are described as mainly present in the seeds of a variety of plants. aais play an important role in the natural defenses of plants  <cit> . both sin proteins contain in these regions tryptophan-rich domains, which are highly similar  to regions coded by wild-type of pina-d1a  and pinb-d1a . the 13-mer of puroa constitutes the antimicrobial active center of puroindoline a  <cit> . the corresponding, 12-mer tryptophan-rich domain in puroindoline b was relatively antimicrobially inactive compared to puroa  <cit> . it is probable that these highly conserved regions of sin proteins express the same properties. these data are also consistent with the hypothesis, that positive selection at the pina region of the hardness locus in the tribe triticeae was congruent with its role as plant defense gene  <cit> . besides the effect of puroindolines on the grain hardness determining technological end-uses and their role in plant defense some new biological functions are suggested  <cit> . the results of proteome analysis of soft and hard near-isogenic wheat lines revealed their possible involvement in the storage protein folding machinery affecting the development of wheat endosperm and the formation of the protein matrix  <cit> .

one of the important advantages of rnai type of silent lines obtained in the process of stable transformation is inheritance of the traits. the t <dig> kernels from the t <dig> generation of triticale plants, which showed an almost equal level of silencing among progeny, might be treated as homozygotes. these selected lines gave a good opportunity for further research concerning other possible functions of sin genes including their influence on the quality, their role in biotic stresses, polar lipids and in the storage protein folding machinery.

CONCLUSIONS
the general effect of rnai-based silencing of sin genes in hexaploid triticale concerning significant decrease of their transcripts and very low level of both secaloindoline proteins were consistent with that obtained for silencing of pin genes in hexaploid wheat. the unexpected differences occurred on phenotypic level. silencing of sina and sinb did not determine grain hardness contrary to their orthologs pina and pinb in wheat. another difference was the total seed protein content in silent lines, which was significantly lower in triticale and similar to control lines in wheat. since both secaloindoline proteins are present in wild-type, medium-soft phenotype of cv. wanad and grain hardness remains unchanged in silenced lines with strongly decreased level of both sin proteins we propose that their biological function does not affect grain texture. selected lines of triticale and wheat showing sirna-mediated allele-specific silencing of both sin and pin genes might be useful in further research.
