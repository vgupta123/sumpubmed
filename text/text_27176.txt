BACKGROUND
leaf rust, caused by puccinia hordei, is one of the most destructive foliar diseases of barley, and has caused significant yield losses in many regions where barley is grown  <cit> . yield reductions of up to 32% have been reported in certain susceptible barley cultivars in both australia and north america  <cit> . due to potentially adverse environmental effects of fungicides, the most preferable and cost-effective means of controlling barley leaf rust is through the development and deployment of durable host resistance  <cit> .

in cereals, two major types of resistance have been described for rust pathogens, seedling resistance and adult plant resistance . seedling resistance genes are effective at all stages of crop development and are often characterized by a hypersensitive response. numerous genes conferring seedling resistance to p. hordei  have been identified , however, virulence matching most of these genes has been detected  <cit> . in some regions, including south australia, the presence of the alternate host ornithogalum umbellatum  can permit sexual recombination and increase the likelihood of new virulent pathotypes developing  <cit> . new sources of seedling resistance are required for use in breeding programs in combination with apr for durable protection against p. hordei. furthermore, for effective deployment within breeding programs, it is equally important to understand the mechanisms of inheritance and pathotype specificity of newly identified resistance genes.

previous studies on the inheritance of seedling resistance to p. hordei have determined that many of the known rph loci are complex. from a total of  <dig> catalogued rph genes, three have been previously reported to be alleles of other genes. rph <dig> is allelic to rph <dig>  <cit> , rph <dig> is allelic to rph <dig>  <cit>  and rph <dig> is allelic to rph <dig>  <cit> . in the case of rph <dig> and rph <dig>  a large f <dig> population of  <dig>  progeny derived from ‘hor 2596’  x ‘triumph’  was evaluated and no recombinants were detected, suggesting that both are alleles of the same gene  <cit> . rph <dig> and rph <dig> also mapped to the same locus on chromosome 5h and were linked to a common molecular marker, abc <dig>  previous studies have determined that the australian cultivar ‘cantala’ carries an uncharacterised seedling gene for resistance to p. hordei that was temporarily designated rphcantala   <cit> . recent evidence suggests the rphc is present in several australian and european barley cultivars and was originally derived from european descent. although virulence for rphc is common among australian populations of p. hordei, such resistance may be useful in combination with other resistance sources. this study reports on the characterization and genetic mapping of the rphc resistance. data on both the physical location and possible candidate genes for the rphc resistance locus are presented and discussed.

sowing, inoculation and disease assessment procedures
sowing and inoculations were performed as described by sandhu et al.  <cit> . disease response was assessed 12 days after inoculation using a modified “0” – “4” scale as described by mcintosh et al.  <cit> . variations of the infection types were indicated by the use of “-” , ‘+’ , ‘c’ , ‘n’  and “x” which denotes a mesothetic infection type with a mixture of infection types on the same leaf. a comma separating different infection types was used to indicate heterogeneity within a given test host genotype. when two different infection types were observed on a single leaf, they were written together without a comma.

genetic mapping of rphc in the ci 9214/stirling dh population
genomic dna was extracted from the leaf tissues of a single plant from a subset of  <dig> from the  <dig> original ci 9214/stirling dh lines using ctab essentially as described by fulton et al.  <cit> . the dna of each dh line was diluted to  <dig> ngμl− <dig> and subjected to genotypic analysis using the dart-seq platform essentially as described by curtois et al.  <cit> , except that the marker curation involved removing the markers with low minor allelic frequency   and > 50% missing data.

genetic linkage maps were constructed using mstmap software  <cit> . the following specific parameters of mstmap were used viz. name for the mapping population: dh; the distance function: kosambi; the threshold to be used for clustering the markers into lgs:  <dig> ; the objective function: count. in addition, any group of markers less than two and with a distance of  <dig> centimorgans  away from the rest of the markers was placed in a separate linkage group. this linkage map of the ci 9214/stirling dh population was specifically constructed for genetic mapping of rphc, for this the phenotypic data of p. hordei pathotype 253p- was converted to binary data [ and was then included as an additional marker. the map positions  of all closely linked dart-seq markers to rphc on the ci 9214/stirling genetic map were compared with the bowman consensus map and the hordeum vulgare l. cv. ‘bowman’ genome assembly  <cit> .

marker-trait and bioinformatic analysis of closely linked dart markers at the rphc locus
marker-trait analysis of each dart marker with the rphc phenotype was conducted by computing fisher’s exact test on  <dig> x  <dig> count tables using r statistical software . the null hypothesis was that the dart marker genotypes were not associated with resistance to p. hordei; hence a random distribution of genotypes in the resistant and susceptible phenotypic groups. the –log <dig> of p values were plotted against the positions on the physical bowman genome assembly  <cit>  by means of chromosome-wise and genome-wide ‘manhattan’ plots.

linkage disequilibrium  r <dig> was measured between the binary scores of the rphc phenotype  with each dart-seq marker genotype using gold  <cit> . the correlation coefficient of each marker with rphc binary phenotypic score was plotted against the bowman genome assembly by means of a genome-wide ‘manhattan’ plot. the sequences of dart-seq markers with r2 >  <dig>  were individually blasted  against the ‘morex’ barley genome sequence browser  to identify the physical scaffold of genes in the region between markers flanking rphc based on relationships between the ci 9214/stirling dh population genetic map and the 'bowman' consensus genetic maps. the physical positions and annotations of all genes located between dart-seq marker dart <dig>  and dart <dig>  were tabulated to identify possible candidates for rphc. further pfam protein annotations were also assigned to the dart-seq markers that were located within predicted genes in the ‘morex’ genome. the haplotype blocks in the significant region were constructed using haploview  <cit>  to examine the ld in the region and among significant dart-seq markers.

RESULTS
multipathotype tests
the barley cultivar ‘cantala’ contained an uncharacterised seedling resistance gene  to p. hordei that was identified through phenotypic assessment of the australian barley differential lines  with a range of p. hordei pathotypes . multi-pathotyping tests on other barley cultivars suggested that that in addition to ‘cantala’ , ‘bandulla’ , ‘bussell’ , ‘chebec’ , ‘hamelin’ , ‘lara’ , ‘milby’ , ‘moondyne’ , ‘noyep’ , ‘parwan’ , ‘research’ , ‘resibee’ , ‘tilga’  and ‘stirling’ also carry rphc. none of these cultivars carried rph <dig> .

genetic analyses of dh population ci 9214/stirling
the parental genotypes of the ci 9214/stirling dh population were postulated to carry rph <dig> and rphc based on the observed infection types  in response to p. hordei pathotypes 200p-  and 253p- , respectively . pathotype 200p- was avirulent on ‘ci 9214’  and ‘triumph’  and virulent on ‘cantala’ . conversely, pathotype 253p- was virulent on ‘ci 9214’  and avirulent on ‘stirling’ , ‘cantala’  and ‘triumph’ . both pathotypes were virulent on the universal susceptible line ‘gus’ . the ci 9214/stirling population of  <dig> dh lines was phenotyped using pathotype 253p- and in response the resistant parent ‘stirling’ gave the same it “;12 = cn” as observed in the barley variety ‘cantala’ with the same pathotype, whilst the susceptible parent ‘ci 9214’ gave it “3+” to this pathotype. the observed segregation within the ci 9214/stirling population fitted with a predicted single gene inheritance model 1: <dig> ratio using chi squared analysis ).figure  <dig>

genetic mapping of rphc
a total of  <dig> representative genotypes of the ci 9214/stirling dh population from both resistant and susceptible phenotypic classes were selected for genetic mapping of rphc and subsequently genotyped using  <dig>  dart-seq marker loci. a genetic map was constructed and contained nine linkage groups spanning  <dig>  cm using over  <dig>  dart-seq markers, which include the rphc binary phenotype as a marker. based on the known positions of flanking markers on the consensus ‘bowman’ , ‘morex’ and ‘barke’ genetic maps, rphc was mapped to chromosome 5hl between 129–134 cm . rphc co-segregated with two dart markers  and was  <dig>  cm distal to the flanking markers dart <dig>  dart <dig> and dart <dig> and  <dig>  cm proximal to dart <dig> and dart <dig> . further genome-wide marker-trait association demonstrated that dart sequences only on 5hl were associated with rphc phenotypic scores indicated by two significant peaks , across the entire genome, at approximately 506 mb on 5hl  and correlated with ld mapping results of rphc . further linkage disequilibrium analysis identified that the 2nd peak at 430 mb was due to incorrect map position of a single dart marker .figure  <dig>

tests of allelism
tests of allelism between rphc and two previously identified rph seedling genes on chromosome 5hl  indicated that rphc is independent of rph <dig> but completely linked with rph <dig>  a two-gene segregation  was observed in f <dig> families involving crosses of rphc with rph <dig> when tested with pathotype 253p- . on other hand, there was no segregation among f <dig> families of cross involving rphc and rph <dig> when tested with pathotype 253p- . this suggests that rphc is an allele of rph <dig>  with distinct specificity and can therefore be given the allele designation rph <dig> am. two additional populations derived from ‘estate’ /‘cantala’ and ‘cebada capa’ /‘cantala’ were also tested with pathotype 253p- and both populations conformed to expected two gene segregation model .table  <dig> chi squared analysis of barley populations for tests for allelism with rphcantala

pedigree analysis for rphc resistance
pedigree analysis was performed on all  <dig> australian barley cultivars postulated to carry rphc including: ‘bandulla’ , ‘bussell’ , ‘cantala’ , ‘chebec’ , ‘hamelin’ , ‘lara’ , ‘milby’ , ‘moondyne’ , ‘noyep’ , ‘parwan’ , ‘research’ , ‘resibee’ , ‘tilga’  and ‘stirling’ using the online barley pedigree resource http://genbank.vurv.cz/barley/pedigree/. on this basis, cultivars ‘gull’ and ‘binder’ were predicted to be the sources of the rphc resistance in ‘stirling’ , ‘bandulla’ , ‘noyep’ , ‘lara’ , ‘stirling’ , ‘research’ , ‘chebec’ , ‘moondyne’ , ‘bussell’ and ‘cantala’. pedigree analysis suggests that ‘maja’  share common ancestry of ‘binder’ and ‘gull’ . both ‘gull’ and ‘binder’ were derived from landraces from sweden  and ‘czechoslovakia’ , respectively . the donor sources of seedling resistance in ‘hannan’ , ‘milby’ and ‘tilga’ could not be explained based on available pedigree information.figure  <dig>

discussion
here we report on the discovery and mapping  of a new seedling resistance allele to p. hordei, previously temporarily designated as rphc. a previous genetic study using a large f <dig> population determined that the rph <dig> resistance locus in ‘triumph’ was an allele of rph <dig>  <cit>  and was therefore re-designated as rph <dig> z based on nomenclature described in franckowiak et al.  <cit> . our studies demonstrated that rphc is an allele of rph <dig>  found in ‘triumph’ based on tests of allelism, chromosomal location and pathotype specificity. tests of allelism were performed in this study by intercrossing ‘cantala’ with barley differential lines carrying rph <dig>  rph <dig>  rph <dig>  rph <dig> and rph <dig>  rphc was independent from rph <dig>  rph <dig>  rph <dig> and rph <dig> based on observed segregation ratios conforming to two-gene prediction models. further genetic analysis of f <dig> populations demonstrated that there was no segregation for resistance to p. hordei pathotype 253p- between ‘cantala’ and ‘triumph’ , suggesting that rphc and rph <dig> are likely allelic and therefore rphc should be designated rph <dig> am.

both multipathotype analysis and observed its between ‘cantala’ , ‘stirling’ and  <dig> other australian barley cultivars postulated to carry rph <dig> am suggest that the resistance mapped in this study is the same gene. rph <dig> am had different specificity than rph <dig> . p. hordei pathotype 253p- was avirulent on rph <dig> am and rph <dig>  however pathotypes 210p+ and 200p- were avirulent on rph <dig> yet virulent on rph <dig> am. genetic analysis of the ci 9214/stirling dh population using the 253p- pathotype conformed to a single gene inheritance contributed by the ‘stirling’ parent. further assessment of this population with p. hordei pts 243p+  and 4610p+  ruled out the involvement of these genes for the resistance observed in the ci 9214/stirling population.

rph <dig>  rph <dig> and rph <dig> am all map to the long arm of chromosome 5h . marker-trait analysis performed in this study using  <dig>  dart markers assigned rph <dig> am to chromosome 5hl in a similar region to both rph <dig> and rph <dig> although there were no comparable markers between genetic maps to accurately assess comparative positions. comparative genetic analysis between the ‘bowman’ and ci 9214/stirling genetic maps identified six markers in common within a 15 cm region of rph <dig> am and this region co-located to qtl for barley leaf rust resistance in barley on 5hl located in between  <dig> and 140 cm from cultivar ‘scarlett’  <cit> . discrepancies were observed between the order and distance of dart markers between the parental genetic map  and the consensus 'bowman' genetic maps. this is likely to be attributed to the limited number of lines used for genetic map construction and mapping the rph <dig> am phenotype. additional file  <dig> gives the marker haplotype data for each closely linked dart to rph <dig> am. a small proportion of markers had missing data and this may further explain the inaccuracy of the marker order and distance observed in the ci 9214/stirling genetic map. bioinformatic analysis on sequence reads derived from dart markers closely linked to rph <dig> am  suggests that there are four likely gene candidates for the rph <dig> am/rph12/rph <dig> locus within a 5 mb gene rich region including an nb-arc, nbs-lrr and two serine/threonine receptor kinases. variation was observed between the ‘bowman’ and ‘morex’ genome assemblies for the physical location of two dart markers , both of which showed highest similarity to the same serine/threonine receptor kinase transcript. such discrepancies are likely to be either due to errors in assembly between the ‘bowman’ and ‘morex’ genomes given their recent release or the absence of mloc_ <dig> within ‘bowman’ , which is seedling susceptible to p. hordei and lacks any of the characterised rph genes and rph <dig> am .

high ld among the significant dart-seq markers in this region, as indicated by haplotype block analysis, suggests that rph <dig> am could be located to a broad region on chromosome 5hl spanning at least 5 mb. given the population size of the f <dig> families used for tests of allelism, it is possible that rph <dig> and rph <dig> am could be independent closely linked resistance genes separated by a very small physical distance. bioinformatic analysis of the genes within the physical region believed to carry rph <dig> am based on ld and the ‘bowman’ consensus map suggest the presence of two nbs genes. the role of nbs-lrr genes and their involvement in race specific resistance to rusts and other plant pathogens is well documented  <cit>  as is their tendency to cluster within grass genomes due to selection for duplication events in response to evolutionary pressure  <cit> . alternatively, there is a possibility that the same one of the serine/threonine receptor kinase genes is responsible for resistance to multiple pathotypes of p. hordei based on previously reported broad spectrum resistance conferred by both rpg <dig> and rpg <dig> to stem rust in barley. both rpg <dig> and rpg <dig> encode serine/threonine receptor kinases and are believed to show marked homology. rpg <dig> maps approximately 20 mb away from the predicted rph <dig> am locus, however, a recent study screening australian barley cultivars with the rpg <dig> marker identified only  <dig> out of the  <dig> lines postulated to carry rph <dig> am also carried rpg <dig> suggesting they are not the same gene  <cit> .

the australian barley cultivars postulated to carry rph <dig> am were all closely related based on available pedigree information. multipathotype testing performed in this study using five p. hordei pathotypes suggests that rph <dig> am is likely to be present in  <dig> australian cultivars. further pedigree analysis of all australian cultivars postulated to carry rph <dig> am demonstrated strong relatedness and shared ancestral pedigrees through ‘gull’ and ‘binder’, which trace the source of the rph <dig> am resistance to a landrace from either sweden or the former czechoslovakia. both ‘cantala’ and ‘stirling’ share a common pedigree in ‘maja’ that was produced from an intercross between ‘gull’ and ‘binder’  <cit> . a previous study reporting on the genealogical analysis and diversity of spring barleys released from the former czechoslovakia and the czech republic determined that three ancestral landraces, including ‘lv-gotland’ , contributed significantly to feed barley cultivars. these cultivars were enriched in germplasm of more productive genotypes and were donors of biotic stress resistance at the sacrifice of malting qualities during breeding  <cit> . previous research has also found however that ‘gull’ is susceptible to australian p. hordei pathotypes and only carried the rph <dig> d allele at the rph <dig> locus. this evidence suggests that 'binder' not 'gull' is the more probable source of the rph <dig> am resistance from ‘cantala’.

CONCLUSIONS
consolidating both previous and present studies, at least three alleles contributing to leaf rust resistance , each with distinct race specificity, map to chromosome 5hl at potentially the same locus. of these three alleles, rph <dig> and rph <dig> am appear to be most common in australian germplasm. genetic mapping and ld analysis in this study determined that rph <dig> am is likely to be located in a physical region spanning 5 mb on chromosome 5hl. furthermore, this region contained three potential gene candidates which will inform future gene cloning efforts of the rph12/rph <dig> am locus for diagnostic marker development.
