BACKGROUND
transcription in eubacteria is mediated by the rna polymerase holoenzyme , which has five constant subunits  and a variable subunit . the constant subunits constitute the rna polymerase core , which has the polymerization activity; the σ subunit determines promoter recognition and functions in the eσ-promoter transition from closed complex to open complex . the primary σ factor in a bacterium, such as σ <dig> in escherichia coli, controls transcription of most housekeeping genes in the cell; alternative sigma factors have specialized regulons that function in the response to environmental stressors or morphological changes, or in developmental systems . in many bacteria the alternative σ factor σ <dig>  has unusually diverse regulons, with genes that function in a variety of cellular processes, including flagellar biogenesis, response to nitrogen starvation, transport and metabolism of carbon substrates, and tolerance to heavy metals  <cit> .

multiple features, including protein structure, promoter consensus sequence, and mode of activation, distinguish σ <dig> from all other primary and secondary sigma factors, which constitute the σ <dig> family . although both σ54- and σ70-type sigma factors associate with the β and β’ subunits of rnap and mediate the binding of eσ to specific promoter sequences, σ <dig> differs extensively from σ70-type sigma factors in primary amino acid sequence and domain organization . the essential promoter features for eσ <dig> recognition and binding center around conserved gg and tgc elements at - <dig> and - <dig>  respectively, relative to the transcription start site   <cit> , while holoenzymes with the various σ70-type sigma factors generally recognize and bind promoter elements at - <dig> and - <dig> with the consensus sequences ttgaca and tataat, respectively . perhaps the most important feature of eσ <dig> that differs from eσ <dig> is the isomerization process . for eσ <dig> the transition from closed complex to open complex is usually spontaneous and rapid, so regulation of transcription initiation frequently occurs at the level of closed complex formation. initiation of transcription by eσ <dig> more closely resembles eukaryotic pol ii systems in that eσ <dig> forms a stable closed complex that requires a bacterial enhancer-binding protein  and atp hydrolysis for isomerization to open complex . the bebps add an additional level of complexity to the σ <dig> regulon.

bebps have a modular structure that is generally conserved: an n-terminal regulatory domain, a central aaa+ atpase domain, and a c-terminal dna binding domain . these proteins activate transcription from σ54-dependent promoters in three basic steps . first, the bebp receives an environmental stimulus through phosphorylation, ligand binding, or protein-protein interactions with the n-terminal regulatory domain that stimulates the bebp to multimerize through the aaa+ atpase domain and bind to an upstream activator sequence  via the c-terminal dna binding domain. the bebp-uas complex is then brought into contact with the eσ54-promoter closed complex via a dna looping event and interactions between highly conserved regions of the aaa+ atpase domain of bebp and σ <dig>  finally, atp hydrolysis drives isomerization, allowing the initiation of transcription.

the requirement for bebp-mediated activation of σ54-dependent transcription presents two problems for global analysis of a σ <dig> regulon. the first is the need for the proper environmental stimulus to activate bebps. since the eσ <dig> closed complex requires an activated bebp, σ54-dependent promoters are usually transcriptionally silent in the absence of the specific stimulus for the bebp  <cit> . analysis of transcription from σ54-dependent promoters under any single growth condition would miss operons whose bebps are not activated under the condition tested. secondly, the requirement for the uas or enhancer by most bebps presents a challenge for predicting whether a eσ <dig> binding site is functioning as a promoter or not. there is no common consensus sequence for the enhancer and their position relative to the promoter can be quite variable. for many σ54-dependent promoters the uas sequence lies ~70-150 bp upstream of the promoter, but other configurations have been characterized, such as enhancers located  <dig>  kb downstream of the rocg promoter in bacillus subtilis <cit>  and up to 3 kb upstream of the promoter in artificial constructs of the glna operon from e. coli <cit> . if a σ <dig> binding site is examined for promoter activity in isolation, such as in a promoter-reporter vector, it is difficult to discern whether a site is inactive because it is not a promoter or because the enhancer was not included in the cloned sequence.

previous studies to define the σ <dig> regulons of escherichia coli <cit> , vibrio cholerae <cit>  and geobacter sulfurreducens <cit>  have recognized the limitations presented by the requirement for activated bebps in the characterization of the full σ <dig> regulon, even when σ <dig> is overexpressed from a heterologous promoter. our approach to overcoming these problems in the global characterization of σ <dig> regulons in bacteria is the utilization of a constitutively-active, promiscuous bebp, the aaa+ atpase domain of sinorhizobium meliloti dctd  <cit> . we chose to assess the efficacy of this approach in salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium lt <dig> , a widely-used laboratory strain, because it has a moderately-sized σ <dig> regulon with  <dig> known or predicted bebps  <cit> , providing sufficient diversity in bebps to test our hypothesis.

we report here that use of this constitutively-active, promiscuous bebp in dna microarrays and promoter function assays permitted detection of nearly all known and predicted σ54-dependent operons. these studies also revealed a new σ54-dependent promoter expressing a putative cas <dig> gene in s. typhimurium lt <dig> . in addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation-microarray  analysis combined with bioinformatics identified  <dig> eσ <dig> or σ <dig> binding sites, of which  <dig> appear to be within open reading frames . this surprising number of intragenic sites suggests regulatory roles for σ <dig> or eσ <dig> that may involve repression, transcriptional interference, or expression of cis- or trans-acting small rna   <cit> .

RESULTS
utility of a promiscuous, constitutive bebp in characterizing the σ <dig> regulon
since all known σ54-dependent promoters require an activated bebp for transcription initiation, it is a challenge to find a condition under which all promoters can be detected within the σ <dig> regulon of a bacterium. in the recent mapping of the s. typhimurium sl <dig> transcriptome using early stationary phase cultures in rich media , only one of the known or predicted σ54-dependent gene transcripts was detected, pspa <cit> . the currently favored approach is over-expression of σ <dig> to facilitate detection of σ54-dependent promoters, which assumes a reasonable basal level of activation of the bebps. using relatively low cutoffs for the fold-change  in transcript levels between the σ54-overexpression strain and wild type or Δrpon strains, a considerable portion of the σ54-dependent transcriptome was defined in escherichia coli <cit> , vibrio cholerae <cit>  and geobacter sulfurreducens <cit> . however, not all previously-identified σ54-dependent operons were detected for e. coli and g. sulfurreducens, and evidence from the v. cholera and g. sulfurreducens studies suggests that overexpression of σ <dig> may repress expression from some σ54-dependent promoters and alter expression of σ54-independent promoters  <cit> . we hypothesize that a promiscuous and constitutive variant of the bebp dctd from s. meliloti can activate transcription from all σ54-dependent promoters in s. typhimurium lt <dig> at wild-type levels of σ <dig> under a single growth condition, thereby facilitating global characterization of the σ <dig> regulon without overexpression of σ <dig>  this promiscuous and constitutive dctd variant is missing the n-terminal response regulator and c-terminal dna binding domains, leaving only the central aaa+ atpase domain, residues  <dig> to  <dig> of dctd and referred to hereafter as dctd <dig>  <cit> . previous work showed that dctd <dig> was able to interact with eσ <dig> in e. coli to drive transcription from the chromosomal glna promoter and from the s. meliloti dcta promoter in the absence of native dctd and without an enhancer sequence  <cit> .

the σ54-dependent promoters of s. typhimurium lt <dig> are normally responsive to one or more of thirteen known and predicted bebps under various growth conditions  <cit> , so to initially assess dctd <dig> activation of transcription from σ54-dependent promoters that respond to different bebps in salmonella, the σ54-dependent promoters for the glnkamtb  and rtcba  operons were introduced upstream of a promoter-less lacz gene and the reporter plasmids were transformed into a derivative of s. typhimurium lt <dig>  and wt containing the dctd <dig> expression plasmid  to perform β-galactosidase assays. the glnkamtb and rtcba promoters were chosen because neither has predicted σ70-dependent promoters within the cloned promoter region and each is responsive to a different bebp: ntrc for glnkamtb <cit>  and rtcr for rtcba <cit> . in the wt strain, the glnkamtb and rtcba operon promoters expressed lacz at very low levels; but in the presence of dctd <dig>  lacz was expressed at 150- and 16-fold higher levels, respectively . to compare the level of expression stimulated by dctd <dig> to the level that is seen under physiological conditions that activate the promoter-associated bebp, lacz expression from the glnkamtb promoter was assayed in the wt strain in nitrogen-limiting medium, which activates ntrc. under nitrogen-starvation conditions ntrc multimerizes, binds the enhancer in the cloned promoter region, and hydrolyzes atp to stimulate transcription by eσ <dig> at the glnkamtb promoter . in the presence of activated ntrc, the glnkamtb promoter expresses lacz at a nearly 10-fold higher level than in the presence of dctd <dig>  this reduced level of activation by dctd <dig> relative to the cognate bebp under activation conditions is consistent with previous studies comparing the activity of truncated versions of bebps, which must interact with eσ <dig> from solution, to that of the wild type bebps, which are directed to the target σ <dig> promoter via binding to the enhancer sequence  <cit> . the control reporter plasmids pdv <dig>  which has the σ70-dependent, circle junction promoter from is <dig> <cit> , and the promoter-less pds <dig> expressed lacz at approximately the same level in wt as wt + dctd <dig> . based on these results, dctd <dig> activates transcription from σ54-dependent promoters that are normally responsive to different bebps under different growth conditions. therefore, we performed dna microarray and promoter-reporter analyses in the presence of the promiscuous, constitutive activator dctd <dig> to assess the efficacy of this approach in defining the σ <dig> regulon of s. typhimurium lt <dig> 

apromoters assayed in lacz-reporter plasmids pds <dig> and pds12: intergenic promoters are predicted promoters for the glnalg, glnkamtb and rtcba operons; intragenic promoters were identified in the chip-chip assay . controls are the σ70-dependent, circle-junction promoter from is <dig> and the empty vector, pds <dig> 

bβ-galactosidase assays were performed in mops minimal medium  or in nitrogen-limiting mops .

microarray analysis of σ54-dependent transcripts in salmonella expressing dctd250
to determine the genes whose transcription is controlled by σ <dig> in s. typhimurium lt <dig> we performed a microarray analysis comparing wt+dctd <dig> to an isogenic strain with a deletion of rpon . rna collected during mid-log phase growth in nutrient medium was reverse transcribed and cdnas from each strain were differentially labeled and applied to a complete orf array containing all annotated open reading frames for s. typhimurium lt <dig>  <cit> . open reading frames that were transcribed in wt at a level > 3-fold higher than in the Δrpon strain, with a p-value < <dig> , were considered up-regulated and, for the purpose of the initial categorization of these results, an operon was considered up-regulated if at least one gene met these criteria. in three biological replicates, the same  <dig> operons were up-regulated in the presence of σ <dig>  the microarray results for s. typhimurium lt <dig> genes within operons that meet the criteria for up-regulation, or that are known or predicted to be σ54-dependent, are shown in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  only  <dig> genes, stm <dig>  stm <dig>  stm <dig>  and stm <dig>  which are part of  <dig> operons in the fels- <dig> prophage, were down-regulated >3-fold with a p-value < <dig>  in the wt strain as compared to the Δrpon strain.

alocus tags for genes within operons or srna genes are grouped by those previously shown to be σ54-dependent in salmonella, previously predicted to be σ54-dependent, or identified in this study as encoded in a novel σ54-dependent transcript. locus tags for operons that are not up-regulated are in bold type.

fthe first gene in the operon was <3-fold up-regulated, but other genes in the operon were >3-fold up-regulated.

known σ54-dependent operons and srna
if our hypothesis is correct, then in the presence of dctd <dig> we should observe up-regulation of operons  and srna genes that are known to have σ54-dependent promoters, even though they are normally activated by different bebps. previously, four salmonella operons have been experimentally shown to be regulated by σ54: prpbcde <cit> , glnhpq <cit> , argt <cit> , and glnalg <cit> . additionally, two srna genes, glmy and glmz, have also been shown to have σ54-dependent promoters  <cit> . table  <dig> summarizes the genes, functions, bebps, and microarray results for the known σ54-dependent operons and srna genes of salmonella.

the dna microarrays showed up-regulation of all four known σ54-dependent operons in salmonella, prpbcde, glnhpq, argt, and glnalg . the two srna genes with known σ54-dependent promoters did not appear up-regulated by σ <dig>  this result was not surprising since in s. typhimurium both glmy and glmz possess σ70-dependent promoters that fully overlap the σ54-dependent promoters, such that the eσ <dig> and eσ <dig> compete for binding to their respective promoters  <cit> . gopel et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the level of glmy transcription was similar in wild type and Δrpon cells and that transcription of glmz actually increased in the rpon mutant, reflecting that the σ70-dependent promoter for glmz is stronger than the σ70-dependent promoter for glmy. the presence of a σ <dig> promoter does not necessarily preclude detection of a σ54-dependent promoter controlling expression of a gene or operon in these microarray assays, though; the promoter region of glna has non-overlapping σ70- and σ54-dependent promoters  <cit> , yet was up-regulated 48-fold. taken together, these results for the known σ54-dependent promoters are consistent with our hypothesis that dctd <dig> can promiscuously and constitutively activate σ54-holoenzyme at a variety of σ54-dependent promoters.

confirmation of predicted σ54-dependent operons
there are  <dig> operons that we define as ‘predicted’ σ54-dependent operons in salmonella. these predictions are based on in silico analyses indicating either homology to known σ54-dependent operons in e. coli and other enteric bacteria or promoter sequence homology along with genetic proximity to predicted bebp genes  <cit> . however, σ54-dependent transcription of these operons has not previously been experimentally demonstrated in salmonella. in the dna microarrays,  <dig> of the  <dig> operons that have been predicted to have σ54-dependent promoters in salmonella were up-regulated in wt+dctd <dig> as compared to Δrpon+dctd <dig> , providing experimental evidence that these genes are, in fact, regulated by σ <dig> in s. typhimurium lt <dig> 

for these  <dig> up-regulated σ54-dependent operons there are  <dig> different bebps that either are known or predicted to activate expression from their σ54-dependent promoters . five of the up-regulated operons, stm0577- <dig>  stm <dig> s- <dig>  stm2360- <dig>  stm3772- <dig>  and stm4535- <dig> s, were predicted to be σ54-dependent based on linkage to a predicted bebp and an upstream sequence with the essential - <dig> and - <dig> elements of a σ54-dependent promoter  <cit> . there are no orthologs in e. coli for the predicted bebps associated with these operons; three of these predicted bebps, stm <dig>  stm <dig> and stm <dig>  are similar to the levr-type ebps found in gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . in addition to the microarray evidence presented here for σ <dig> regulation of these operons, we know that stm <dig> is the bebp controlling expression of stm3772- <dig> and that this operon encodes the components of a phosphotransferase system permease for d-glucosaminic acid and enzymes required for catabolism of this acid sugar  <cit> . these results show that dctd <dig> can activate expression at σ54-dependent promoters that are normally regulated by the levr-type bebps.

of the four predicted σ54-dependent operons that did not fulfill our criteria for upregulation in the microarray, at least two have additional σ54-independent promoters, which may have masked the effect of σ <dig> on transcription levels. the heat shock sigma factor gene rpoh has been shown to be under the control of additional promoters and other regulatory proteins in e. coli <cit> . the conservation of this promoter region for rpoh in s. typhimurium lt <dig> suggests that a similar complex regulatory scheme may be involved  <cit> , thereby reducing the effects of the Δrpon mutation. the yeagh operon, which was just below the 3-fold cutoff for up-regulation in the microarray analysis, has previously been shown to be under control of σs in salmonella <cit> ; however, our assays utilized s. typhimurium lt <dig>  which has a defective rpos gene due to a transversion mutation in the start codon  <cit> . the promoter-reporter assay with the yeagh promoter region, described below, suggests there is a σ54- and σs-independent promoter expressing the yeagh operon in both the wt+dctd <dig> and Δrpon+dctd <dig> strains.

the frequency of alternate promoters seen for the σ54-dependent operons in salmonella  is not unique. zhao et al.  <cit>  estimate that 14% of σ54-dependent genes in e. coli are transcribed by σ70-associated rna polymerase and suggest that expression of σ54–dependent genes from alternate promoters allows for differential expression under various environmental conditions.

new potential σ54-dependent genes
in addition to the σ54-dependent expression of known or predicted genes and operons, the dna microarray analysis revealed up-regulation of a gene, stm <dig>  which has not previously been reported or predicted to be σ54-dependent. stm <dig> is the penultimate gene in a nine-gene operon that is annotated as a group of crispr-associated  genes. although none of the other genes in this operon seem to be controlled by σ <dig>  further evidence is presented below that supports the presence of a σ54-dependent promoter within the gene upstream of stm <dig>  crispr  and cas genes constitute an adaptive immune system in bacteria and archaea that protects against invading mobile dna, such as phage and plasmids  <cit> . the response to phage infection, which is referred to as phage shock, is regulated by σ <dig> and the bebp pspf in e. coli <cit> ; thus, it would not be surprising for essential components of the bacterial immune response in phage infection to be regulated similarly. the potential σ54-dependent gene stm <dig> is a homologue of the cas <dig> gene, which is an endonuclease that is associated with all crispr loci and is most likely involved in the adaptation phase of the crispr-cas immune system  <cit> . the regulation of this cas1-like gene by pspf in salmonella is currently under investigation.

there were  <dig> additional orfs that met the 3-fold cutoff for up-regulation by σ <dig> in the microarray assay, including genes for pilin biosynthesis , histidine ammonia lyase , bebps , propanediol utilization , siderophore production , and cell invasion . the whole genome chromatin immunoprecipitation assays described below did not reveal σ <dig> binding sites associated with these orfs; thus the expression of these genes may be indirectly affected by the absence of σ <dig> in the Δrpon mutant, or constitute false positives .

chip-chip analysis of genome-wide σ <dig> binding sites in salmonella
in the characterization of the σ <dig> regulon of salmonella, determination of the genomic binding sites for the eσ <dig> allows confirmation of primary transcripts indicated by microarray analysis and recognition of potential σ54-regulated genes that might not have been detected due to instability of the transcripts. to assess the binding of eσ <dig> in the s. typhimurium lt <dig> genome, we isolated σ54-dna complexes from wt and Δrpon strains that did not contain the dctd <dig> expression plasmid. since bebps do not activate transcription by recruiting eσ <dig> to promoter sequences  <cit> , inclusion of dctd <dig> should not be necessary to detect binding of holoenzyme to promoter sequences in the chip-chip assay. protein-dna complexes containing either eσ <dig> or σ <dig> are pulled down in the chip with α-σ <dig>  the σ <dig> subunit is most likely to interact with the genome in the context of the rna polymerase holoenzyme; however, σ <dig> has been shown to specifically bind in the absence of the core rna polymerase at σ54-dependent promoters that have a t-tract upstream of the gc in the - <dig> promoter element  <cit> . dna fragments from the α-σ <dig> chip were labeled and applied to the same complete open reading frame arrays as used in the microarray analysis.

since the use of the orf arrays did not allow direct mapping of the binding sites, we combined the chip-chip data with in silico analysis to determine the potential σ <dig> dna binding sites. a position-specific score matrix  was created using  <dig> known or previously predicted σ54-dependent promoters from s. typhimurium lt <dig> ; the extent of each promoter sequence used for the pssm  was based on the consensus sequence for σ54-dependent promoters defined by barrios et al.  <cit>  and comparison analysis of the known salmonella σ54-dependent promoters. this pssm was applied with the motif locator program  <cit>  to the enriched orf sequence and 1000 bp of flanking sequence on both sides of the orf to identify potential σ <dig> dna binding sites. the size range of dna fragments that were pulled down via chip and amplified by ligation-mediated pcr was 200–1000 bp long, as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis, suggesting that intergenic binding sites up to 1000 bp from the enriched orf might be detected in the chip-chip assays.

σ <dig> binding to promoters for known, predicted, and novel σ54-dependent operons
in the chip-chip assays with the wt and Δrpon strains, the promoter-proximal gene for all the  <dig> known and predicted σ54-dependent operons and the  <dig> srna genes  were enriched, as defined by a stringent cut-off, i.e. signal ratio ≥ <dig> and p-value < <dig>  . the associated promoter sequences, as determined by the in silico analysis, had pssm scores ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and were within  <dig> to 154 bp of the enriched orf. in the dna microarrays, six of the known or predicted σ54-dependent operons did not appear up-regulated; but in the chip-chip assays the promoter regions for all six operons gave signal ratios ranging from  <dig> - to 39-fold greater in wt than in Δrpon cells. the detection of the σ54-dependent promoters for all the other known and predicted σ54-dependent operons supports the efficacy of our approach to mapping potential σ54-binding sites.

^the predicted binding site is a potential promoter for a neighboring gene based on its orientation and location within  <dig> bp of the 5’ end of a neighboring gene or a long intergenic region  that may encode a srna.

the chip-chip analyses also showed that only one  of the  <dig> newly-identified, potential σ54-dependent operons from the dna microarray assays has a σ <dig> dna binding site associated with it , suggesting that the other  <dig> operons may be indirectly regulated by σ <dig>  the σ <dig> dna binding site associated with stm <dig>  the cas1-like gene, is within the upstream gene, stm <dig> . further characterization of this potential σ <dig> promoter is described below in the promoter-reporter analysis.

σ <dig> binding to newly identified potential promoter and regulatory sites
in total,  <dig> orfs were each found to be enriched in  <dig> replicate samples for the wt cells as compared to the Δrpon cells in the chip-chip assays . the potential σ <dig> binding site with the highest pssm score within each enriched orf or up to 1000 bp of flanking intergenic sequence was identified by motif locator and is reported in table  <dig>  for the  <dig> enriched orfs,  <dig> of the associated binding sites mapped to intergenic regions and  <dig> of the potential σ <dig> binding sites were located within the enriched orf . in determining the most likely binding site for an enriched orf, sequence within an adjacent non-enriched orf was not considered for potential σ <dig> binding sites, since the orf containing the binding site should be enriched; therefore, even if a site with a higher pssm score was located in an immediately adjacent non-enriched orf, the next highest scoring site found in either the enriched orf or adjacent intergenic sequence was reported as the potential binding site in table  <dig>  this reflects a limitation of the in silico prediction of σ <dig> binding sites based on a pssm that was created with known and predicted intergenic promoter sequences; the sequences for intragenic promoters or for σ <dig> binding sites that are regulatory sites, but not promoters, may differ enough to appreciably affect pssm scores.

consensus sequences were generated using weblogo  <cit>  for the intergenic and intragenic potential σ <dig> binding sequences and for the promoter sequences used to generate the pssm . noteworthy differences in the consensus sequence for the intragenic σ <dig> binding sites, as compared to the consensus sequences for the intergenic σ <dig> binding sites and pssm promoters, are at the − <dig> and − <dig> positions, which each contribute in different ways to σ54-promoter dna interactions. the − <dig> a-t base pair is important in promoter recognition by σ54; the winged helix-turn-helix dna binding motif of σ <dig> makes base-specific contacts with the top strand gg at positions − <dig> and − <dig> and with the bottom strand t at position − <dig>  <cit> . the base pairs immediately adjacent to the conserved gc element in the - <dig> region of the promoter are involved in eσ <dig> binding to form the stable closed complex; the bases on the bottom strand of the promoter at the - <dig> and - <dig> positions interact with σ <dig> in a short region of ‘early melting’ that stabilizes closed complex until the bebp binds σ <dig> and activates the holoenzyme to transition to open complex  <cit> . the reduced conservation of nucleotide sequence at the − <dig> and − <dig> positions for the potential intragenic σ <dig> binding sites may reflect varied functionality of these intragenic sites, or a level of inaccuracy inherent to in silico prediction of the binding sites associated with enriched orfs in the chip-chip assays.

the position and orientation for each potential σ <dig> binding site are indicated in table  <dig> and summarized for all the binding sites in figure  <dig>  this information is useful in considering possible functions for the binding sites. for example, the  <dig> intragenic σ <dig> binding sites oriented in the opposing direction of the gene might regulate by transcription interference and/or anti-sense rna  <cit> . four intragenic σ <dig> binding sites are within 250 bp of the 5’ end of a downstream gene, or a large intergenic region , and oriented in the direction such that they might act as promoters for the downstream gene or a srna  <cit> . binding sites located near a functional σ <dig> promoter may serve to accelerate the search for the promoter by eσ <dig> sliding from the secondary sites  <cit> ; while binding sites adjacent to, or overlapping, a σ70- or σ54-promoter may bind eσ <dig> or σ <dig> and repress or activate transcription from the other promoter  <cit> . the possible functions of the σ <dig> binding sites are quite varied and many are dependent on whether the binding site can function as a promoter.

it is likely that our initial approach to defining the global binding sites of σ <dig> in s. typhimurium lt <dig> resulted in an underestimation of the number of binding sites. multiple sites within ~ <dig>  bp of an orf would enrich one or two adjacent orfs and, in our analysis, would have been counted as one site. in addition, since eσ54-promoter closed complexes are reversible  <cit> , some complexes might have not been detected due to high disassociation rates; detection of these sites may be improved in the presence of dctd <dig>  which stimulates conversion of closed complex to the more stable open complex, and rifampicin, which prevents extension of rna past the second or third nucleotide  <cit> , thus improving the chances of cross-linking eσ <dig> at the promoter sequence  <cit> .

promoter-reporter analysis to determine activity for predicted promoter sequences
to assess the functionality of σ <dig> binding sites defined by the chip-chip and pssm analyses, promoter-lacz fusion assays were performed using several of these sequences. we had two goals in performing these assays. first, we wanted to further confirm the σ54-dependent promoter activity for some of the predicted σ54-dependent promoters that were up-regulated in the dna microarrays and enriched in the chip-chip assays. secondly, we wanted to test the σ <dig> binding site predictions from the chip-chip combined with pssm analyses; i.e. does a potential σ <dig> binding site equate to a σ54-dependent promoter? this promoter function assay is the initial exploration of the roles for σ <dig> binding sites located within intragenic regions.

potential promoters were introduced upstream of a promoter-less lacz gene in a reporter vector, either pds <dig> or pds <dig> . these promoter-reporter plasmids were co-transformed along with the dctd <dig> expression plasmid into either wt or Δrpon cells. after induction of dctd <dig> expression, standard β-galactosidase assays were performed. the results from wt were compared to those from the Δrpon mutant to determine whether activity seen was σ54-dependent . for intergenic sequences that were known or predicted to be σ54-dependent promoters, the results matched those observed in the dna microarray assays . the glna, glnk, and stm <dig>  promoters showed strong σ54-dependent activity. for the glmy, glmz, rpoh, and yeag promoters, transcription in the Δrpon mutant was either as high as or higher than in wild type cells. this is likely due to the presence of σ70-type promoters in the cloned sequence. in addition to the σ <dig> dependent promoters, other promoters have been reported upstream of glmy, glmz, rpoh, and yeag <cit> .

a total of eight intragenic sites identified in the chip-chip assay were selected for functional analysis . all of these predicted sites had pssm scores > <dig>  as shown in figure 4c, the sites chosen represent a variety of configurations with regard to their position and orientation within the orf as well as the position and orientation of downstream orfs. given the possible functions for an intragenic promoter sequence , results of our analysis allow us to determine which, if any, of these roles may be attributable to any of these promoters.

comparing the levels of lacz expression in wild type cells to those in Δrpon mutants, we found that four of the eight intragenic sites were able to function as σ54-dependent promoters. for these sites, the difference observed between wt and Δrpon cells varied from  <dig> -fold for the sequence located in stm <dig> to  <dig> -fold for the sequence within stm <dig>  overall, the level of transcription from these promoters was relatively low, with miller units ranging from ~30- <dig>  the low activity levels may indicate that eσ <dig> has a low affinity for these sequences or that the dctd <dig> is inefficient in productively engaging closed complexes formed at these sites. a subset of the promoter-reporter plasmids with intragenic sites that exhibited σ54-dependent transcription were also assayed in wt cells versus wt-dctd <dig> to determine the dependence of transcription on the promiscuous, constitutive bebp . all three intragenic promoters assayed, stm <dig>  stm <dig>  and stm <dig>  gave low levels of β-galactosidase activity in the absence of dctd <dig> and from  <dig> - to 34-fold higher levels of β-galactosidase activity in the presence of dctd <dig>  the σ54-dependent transcription from intragenic binding sites suggests previously unrecognized regulatory functions for σ <dig> in salmonella; however, it will be critical to characterize transcription from their chromosomal loci before biological functions can be ascribed.

some of the potential promoter sequences that were assayed failed to show any transcriptional activity. there are a number of possible reasons for the lack of promoter activity for these sites. two likely explanations are: 1) the wrong sequence was chosen as the binding site based on the pssm score and proximity to the enriched orf in the chip-chip assays, i.e. a lower scoring sequence near the enriched orf was the actual σ <dig> binding site; or 2) the σ <dig> binding site does not function as a promoter but serves another regulatory role, such as an operator site for regulating promoter activity, a site for transient binding in facilitated diffusion, or a site for sequestering eσ <dig> in order to increase local concentration .

summary of s. typhimurium lt <dig> σ <dig> regulon and comparison to σ <dig> regulons of other bacteria
figure  <dig> summarizes the results from the dna microarray and promoter-fusion assays performed in the presence of dctd <dig> and chip-chip in the absence of dctd <dig> to characterize the σ <dig> regulon of s. typhimurium lt <dig>  based on dna microarray, there are  <dig> up-regulated operons ; global chip-chip combined with in silico analysis revealed at least  <dig> σ <dig> binding sites , of which  <dig> were associated with up-regulated operons from the dna microarrays. the promoter-lacz fusions with seven of the  <dig> intergenic σ <dig> binding sites and eight of the  <dig> intragenic σ <dig> binding sites showed dctd250- and σ54-dependent expression for three intergenic sites  and four intragenic σ <dig> binding sites . the cellular functions impacted by genes in the σ <dig> regulon of s. typhimurium lt <dig> are quite diverse, ranging from carbon-source and amino acid metabolism to response to stressors, such as nitric oxide and toxic levels of zinc . our results suggest that a new cellular process may be added to this extensive list—cell immunity through the crispr system; the role of σ <dig> in regulating a cas1-related gene within an operon of crispr-associated genes is presently being investigated.

the σ <dig> global regulon of s. typhimurium lt <dig> may differ from that of virulent s. typhimurium isolates due to accumulated mutations in this extensively-used, laboratory strain, particularly the rpos mutation that contributes to attenuation of the lt <dig> strain  <cit> . changes in the level of expression of one sigma factor can alter the expression of genes that are expressed by different sigma factors  <cit> ; for example, it has been shown that deletion of rpon alters expression of σs-dependent promoters in e. coli <cit> . we are currently characterizing the σ <dig> global regulon of the virulent strain s. typhimurium 14028s.

the σ <dig> regulons in other δ/γ-proteobacteria have been characterized experimentally to varying extents  <cit> . only in vibrio cholera  <dig> strain v <dig> have both global transcripts and binding sites been characterized experimentally  <cit> . in e. coli mg <dig> and geobacter sulfurreducens, the global σ <dig> transcriptomes were determined and local σ <dig> binding sites associated with up-regulated genes were assessed by computational analysis and selected promoters were assessed experimentally  <cit> . the number and diversity of the operons that are directly controlled by σ54-promoters in these δ/γ-proteobacteria are comparable to that of s. typhimurim lt <dig>  the greatest variability in the σ <dig> regulons of the γ-proteobacteria appears to be the location of σ <dig> binding sites. zhao et al.  <cit>  estimated  <dig> σ <dig> promoters in e. coli mg <dig>  of which  <dig>  were intragenic or located between convergently transcribed genes. in v. cholera, dong and mekalanos  <cit>  identified a total  <dig> σ <dig> binding sites, of which  <dig>  were intragenic and, similarly, we found  <dig> potential σ <dig> binding sites of which  <dig>  appear to be located in intragenic regions.

does the success with dctd <dig> in characterizing the s. typhimurium σ <dig> regulon predict utility of this constitutive, promiscuous activator in defining σ <dig> global regulons in bacteria from other classes in the proteobacteria phylum, or from other phyla? the key to activation of eσ <dig> by dctd <dig> in diverse bacteria is the ability of the activator to make the appropriate interactions with σ <dig> in the context of the eσ54-promoter closed complex; thus, comparison of interacting regions of σ <dig> and bebps between s. typhimurium and phylogenetically diverse bacteria is a good predictor of success. extensive characterization of bebp activation of eσ <dig> in closed complex has shown that the gaftga motif of the aaa+ atpase domain plays a primary and essential role for productive interactions with eσ <dig>  which lead to transcriptional activation ; the gaftga motif is very highly conserved among bebps in all bacteria that encode σ <dig>  which includes bacteria from a majority of the eubacterial phyla  <cit> . it has not yet been determined which specific residues of σ <dig> are contacted by loop  <dig> of the bebp aaa+ atpase domain, but it has been clearly demonstrated that multiple residues within the amino-terminal  <dig> amino acids of σ <dig>  are key determinants for activator interaction  <cit>  and there is extensive conservation of amino acid sequence in region i for σ <dig> from phylogenetically diverse bacteria  <cit> . thus, the comparison of interacting regions of σ <dig> and the aaa+ atpase domain among diverse bacteria predicts that dctd <dig> will be a valuable tool in characterizing the σ <dig> regulons in many bacteria.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of dna microarray and promoter-lacz fusion analyses of the σ <dig> regulon of s. typhimurium lt <dig> in the presence of dctd <dig> support our initial hypothesis: the aaa+ atpase activation domain of dctd can stimulate transcription from σ54-dependent promoters in a constitutive and promiscuous manner, thereby facilitating the global characterization of σ <dig> regulons. sixteen previously predicted σ54-dependent operons were confirmed, and a new σ54-dependent gene, cas <dig>  was identified by the dna microarray and chip-chip analyses. in addition, the chip-chip analyses indicate an excess of σ <dig> binding sites compared to the number of σ54-dependent transcripts and a high percentage of intragenic binding sites, suggesting that eσ <dig> and σ <dig> may have more regulatory functions than transcription initiation at the start of an operon or srna. the number of functional promoters located inside genes suggests a need to consider such promoters in bioinformatic analyses of transcription factor binding sites.
