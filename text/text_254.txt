BACKGROUND
hydrogen and formate are electron donors frequently used by anaerobic microorganisms. metabolism of hydrogen and formate is often highly interlinked in many bacteria that can oxidize both compounds. this is exemplified in the fermentative metabolism of the enterobacterium escherichia coli where up to one third of the carbon from glucose is converted to formate; formate is then disproportionated to h <dig> and co <dig>  <cit> . formate can be metabolized by three membrane-associated, molybdo-seleno formate dehydrogenases , termed fdh-h , fdh-n  and fdh-o . fdh-h is encoded by the fdhf gene and together with one of the four -hydrogenases  of e. coli, hyd- <dig>  forms the hydrogen-evolving formate hydrogenlyase  enzyme complex.

fdh-n  and fdh-o  are highly related enzymes at both the amino acid sequence and functional levels  <cit> . they are multi-subunit oxidoreductases each comprising a large catalytic subunit , an electron-transfer subunit  and a membrane-anchoring subunit ; the latter has a quinone-binding site that allows transfer of electrons derived from formate oxidation into the respiratory chain  <cit> . both enzymes have their respective active site located on the periplasmic face of the cytoplasmic membrane and they couple formate oxidation to energy conservation. a key feature of all three fdh enzymes is the presence of selenocysteine, a bis-molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide  cofactor and a  cluster in their respective catalytic subunit  <cit> . although the synthesis of the fdh-n enzyme is induced to maximal levels during growth in the presence of nitrate, the enzyme is also present at lower levels during fermentative growth  <cit> . fdh-o is synthesized constitutively and is present at low levels aerobically, during fermentative growth and nitrate respiration  <cit> .

e. coli has also the coding capacity to synthesize four membrane-associated, multi-subunit hyd enzymes, which are termed hyd- <dig> through hyd- <dig>  <cit> . hyd- <dig>  hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> have been characterized in detail. like fdh-n and fdh-o, hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> have their active sites located facing the periplasm  <cit> . both enzymes oxidize hydrogen and contribute to energy conservation. due to the fact that hydrogenases catalyze the reversible oxidation of dihydrogen in vitro, the activities of all three characterized -hydrogenases of e. coli can be determined simultaneously in a single reaction using hydrogen as electron donor and the artificial electron acceptor benzyl viologen   <cit> . moreover, the hydrogen-oxidizing activities of hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> can also be visualized after electrophoretic separation under non-denaturing conditions in the presence of detergent  <cit> . because of its apparent labile nature the activity of hyd- <dig> cannot be visualized after gel electrophoresis.

it was noted many years ago  <cit>  that in non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels a slowly-migrating protein complex with a hydrogen: bv oxidoreductase enzyme activity, apparently unrelated to either hyd- <dig> or hyd- <dig>  could be visualized after electrophoretic separation of membrane fractions derived from e. coli grown under anaerobic conditions. in this study, this hydrogenase-independent enzyme activity could be identified as being catalyzed by the highly related fdh-n and fdh-o enzymes.

RESULTS
hydrogenase-independent hydrogen: bv oxidoreductase activity in e. coli membranes
membrane fractions derived from anaerobically cultured wild-type e. coli k- <dig> strains such as p4x  <cit>  and mc <dig>  <cit>  exhibit a slowly migrating hydrogen: benzyl viologen  oxidoreductase activity that cannot be assigned to either hyd- <dig> or hyd- <dig>  previous findings based on non-denaturing page  <cit>  estimated a size of approximately  <dig> kda for this complex. to demonstrate the hydrogenase-independent nature of this enzyme activity, extracts derived from a hypf mutant, which lacks the central hydrogenase maturase hypf and consequently is unable to synthesize active -hydrogenases  <cit> , retained this single slowly migrating species exhibiting hydrogen:bv oxidoreductase activity, while the activity bands corresponding to hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> were no longer visible . this result demonstrates that the activity of this slowly migrating band is completely unrelated to the -hydrogenases hyd- <dig>  hyd- <dig>  hyd- <dig> or hyd- <dig>  note that no active, stained bands were observed when this experiment was performed with a nitrogen gas atmosphere .

formate dehydrogenases n and o catalyze hydrogen:bv oxidoreduction
in order to identify the enzyme responsible for this new hydrogen: bv oxidoreductase activity, the hypf deletion mutant was grown anaerobically and the membrane fraction was prepared . the hydrogen: bv oxidoreductase activity could be released from the membrane in soluble form by treatment with the detergent triton x- <dig>  enrichment of the activity was achieved by separation from contaminating membrane proteins using q-sepharose anion exchange, phenyl sepharose hydrophobic interaction chromatography and finally gel filtration on a superdex- <dig> size exclusion column . fractions with enzyme activity were monitored during the enrichment procedure using activity-staining after non-denaturing page. a representative elution profile from the superdex- <dig> chromatography step, together with the corresponding activity gel identifying the active enzyme, are shown in figure  <dig>  two distinct peaks that absorbed at  <dig> nm could be separated  and the hydrogen: bv oxidoreductase activity was found to be exclusively associated with the higher molecular mass symmetric peak labelled p <dig> . this peak eluted after  <dig> ml  and was estimated to have a mass of between 500- <dig> kda .

the band showing hydrogen: bv oxidoreductase activity in figure 2b was carefully excised and the polypeptides within the fraction were analyzed by mass spectrometry. both fdh-o and fdh-n enzymes were unambiguously identified: the polypeptides fdog, fdoh, fdoi, fdng, and fdnh were identified. the catalytic subunits of fdh-o and fdh-n share 74% amino acid identity and both enzymes are synthesized at low levels during fermentative growth. fdh-n is a trimer of trimers  with molecular mass of  <dig> kda  <cit>  and this correlates well with the estimated size of the protein complex showing h2: bv oxidoreductase activity as revealed by non-denaturing page and size exclusion chromatography.

both fdh-n and fdh-o can catalyze the formate-dependent reduction of either bv or dcpip   <cit> , whereby fdh-n transfers electrons much more readily to dcpip than to bv  <cit> . analysis of fraction p <dig> from the gel filtration experiment revealed a formate: bv oxidoreductase activity of  <dig> mu mg protein- <dig> and a formate: dcpip oxidoreductase activity of  <dig>  u mg protein- <dig> . in comparison, the h2: bv oxidoreductase activity of fraction p <dig> was  <dig> mu mg protein- <dig>  while no enzyme activity could be detected when hydrogen gas was replaced with nitrogen gas.

a the buffer used was  <dig> mm sodium phosphate ph  <dig> ; bv was used at a final concentration of  <dig> mm; formate was added to a final concentration of  <dig> mm; and pms/dcpip were added at final concentrations of  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm, respectively.

b the mean and standard deviation  of at least three independent experiments are shown.

all three fdh enzymes in e. coli are selenocysteine-containing proteins  <cit> . therefore, a mutant unable to incorporate selenocysteine co-translationally into the polypeptides should lack this slow-migrating enzyme h2-oxidizing activity. analysis of crude extracts derived from the selc mutant fm <dig>  which is unable to synthesize the selenocysteine-inserting trnasec  <cit> , lacked the hydrogenase-independent activity band observed in the wild-type , consistent with the activity being selenium-dependent. notably hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> both retained activity in the selc mutant.

fdh-n and fdh-o can also transfer the electrons from hydrogen to other redox dyes
the catalytic subunits of fdh-n and fdh-o are encoded by the fdng and fdog genes, respectively  <cit> . to analyse the extent to which fdh-n and fdh-o contributed to hydrogen: bv oxidoreductase activity after fermentative growth the activity in mutants with a deletion mutation either in fdng or in fdog was analyzed. introduction of a deletion mutation in the fdng gene resulted in a slight reduction in intensity of the h2: bv oxidoreductase activity band . the fdog mutation also resulted in a similar phenotype . introduction of the fdng or fdog genes on plasmids into the respective mutants restored full activity. an activity band associated with hyd- <dig> was used as a loading control for these experiments. strain ftd <dig>  which has mutations in the genes encoding the catalytic subunits of hyd- <dig>  hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig>  <cit> , and thus cannot synthesize active -hydrogenases, lacked the hyd- <dig> activity band but retained the fdh-n/o hydrogen-oxidizing activity . note that the isogenic wild type bw <dig> of the jw series of strains had an identical phenoytype to that of mc <dig> . these experiments demonstrate that under fermentative growth conditions fdh-n and fdh-o both contribute to the h2: bv oxidoreductase enzyme activity.

fdh-n and fdh-o catalyze the formate-dependent reduction of phenazine methosulphate/nitroblue tetrazolium , which can be used to visualize fdh enzyme activity after non-denaturing page  <cit> . staining for formate: pms/nbt oxidoreductase enzyme activity  revealed that after growth under fermentative conditions, fdh-o had a stronger contribution to the overall intensity of the activity band than fdh-n, because while extracts derived from the fdng mutant had similar activity to the wild type, the activity in an extract from the fdog mutant was considerably reduced. introduction of the fdog gene on a plasmid, however, restored the activity to the mutant . notably, replacing formate with hydrogen as electron donor revealed that both enzymes also catalyzed the hydrogen-dependent reduction of pms/nbt . a similar pattern for h2: pms/nbt oxidoreductase activity was observed as was seen for formate: pms/nbt oxidoreductase activity . taken together, these findings suggest that fdh-n is the more effective enzyme at transferring the electrons from h <dig> to bv/ttc than to pms/nbt. that fdh-o is nevertheless effective at catalyzing h2-dependent bv reduction is shown in the lane containing an extract derived from cp <dig>  in which an fnr mutation was introduced into the hydrogenase-negative strain ftd <dig> . synthesis of fdh-n is absolutely dependent on the redox regulator fnr  <cit>  and thus is absent in an fnr mutant. in contrast, fdh-o activity is apparently up-regulated in the fnr mutant .

fdh-n/o show h2: bv and h2: pms/nbt oxidoreductase activities in extracts after respiratory growth with nitrate
biosynthesis of fdh-n is enhanced when e. coli is grown anaerobically in the presence of nitrate  <cit> , while synthesis of fdh-o is essentially constitutive  <cit> . the same strains analyzed in figure 4a were grown anaerobically in the presence of nitrate and aliquots of crude extracts were separated by non-denaturing page followed by staining for h2: bv oxidoreductase, h2: pms/nbt oxidoreductase and formate: pms/nbt oxidoreductase activities. the gel presented in the top panel of figure 4b shows clearly a h2: bv oxidoreductase activity in extracts of strains ftd <dig>  cp <dig> , as well as in the fdog mutant. the activity in extracts of mc <dig> shown in this experiment was only weakly discernable . as anticipated  <cit> , synthesis of hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> was strongly reduced in mc <dig> after growth in the presence of nitrate . the mutant with a deletion in the fdng gene essentially lacked h2: bv oxidoreductase activity but this could be recovered by introduction of the fdng gene on plasmid pca24n-fdng+ .

aliquots of the same extracts specifically stained to visualize h2: pms/nbt oxidoreductase and formate: pms/nbt oxidoreductase activities showed a strong fdh-n-dependent h2: pms/nbt oxidoreductase activity . substituting hydrogen with formate as electron donor delivered a similar staining pattern .

hydrogen oxidation by fdh-n and fdh-o is dependent on the accessory proteins fdhd and fdhe
the fdoghi operon encoding fdh-o is flanked by fdhd and fdhe, both of which encode accessory enzymes required for the synthesis of active fdh enzymes  <cit> . to demonstrate the dependence of the h2-oxidizing activities of both fdhs on fdhd and fdhe, individual mutants lacking either the fdhd or the fdhe gene were analyzed under the same conditions as described above for the wild type and fdog and fdng mutants. all three activities were absolutely dependent on both fdhd and fdhe . complementation experiments revealed that while fdhd on a plasmid fully complemented the fdhd mutation, plasmid-encoded fdhe only partially complemented the fdhe mutation.

discussion
we demonstrate here that both of the respiratory formate dehydrogenases fdh-n and fdh-o have hydrogen-oxidizing enzyme activity. together with the three characterized -hydrogenases, these are the only two enzymes in e. coli crude extracts that had this activity. these results suggest that the fdh-n and fdh-o enzymes show a degree of non-specificity with regard to the electron donor they can use. notably, formate and dihydrogen  and  are both strong reductants.

previous studies have demonstrated that e. coli can couple hydrogen oxidation to nitrate reduction and hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> participate in this process  <cit> . however, attempts to demonstrate significant hydrogen-dependent nitrate reduction in the absence of hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> did not deliver reproducible levels of hydrogen oxidation, presumably due to the limited hydrogen-oxidizing activity of fdh-n and fdh-o. nevertheless, the findings reported here might have physiological relevance in other microorganisms. for example, enzymes with subunits orthologous to fdng are found in the obligate dehalorespiring and hydrogen-oxidizing dehalococcoides spp., e.g. strain cbdb <dig>  and have an associated subunit with similarity to hydrogenase membrane-anchoring subunits  <cit> . rather than having a selenocysteinyl residue in their presumptive active site they have a seryl residue. it is established that in e. coli replacement of selenocysteine with serine abolishes the formate-oxidizing activity of fdh-h  <cit> . moreover, it is also clear that dehalococcoides strain cbdb <dig> cannot use formate as a substrate, suggesting that this formate dehydrogenase-like enzyme might have another function. one possibility based on the findings presented here might be that it accepts h <dig> as substrate.

as both fdh enzymes are selenium-dependent, impaired co-translational insertion of selenocysteine prevented synthesis of either enzyme and concomitantly abolished the -hydrogenase-independent h2: bv oxidoreductase activity. moreover, because both fdh-n and fdh-o are absolutely dependent on the fdhe and fdhd proteins for activity of the enzyme  <cit> , deletion of fdhe and fdhd also abolished specifically this h2: bv oxidoreductase activity. the precise functions of fdhd and fdhe in formate dehydrogenase biosynthesis remain to be established; however, it is likely that they perform a function in post-translational maturation of the enzymes  <cit> .

while it is established that the iron-molybdenum cofactor in nitrogenase catalyzes unidirectional proton reduction as an inevitable consequence of nitrogen reduction  <cit> , the studies here present the first report of a seleno-molybdenum enzyme catalyzing dihydrogen activation. recent studies have shown that high-valence  oxo-molybdenum model complexes can activate dihydrogen at high temperature and h <dig> pressure  <cit> . the crystal structure of fdh-n  <cit>  also reveals a similar geometry of the molybdenum atom to these model complexes; however, along with the four cis thiolate groups, which are derived from the two mgd cofactors, a hydroxyl from a water molecule and the selenate group from selenocysteine coordinate the mo atom. the coordination geometry might play an important role in conferring hydrogen activation capability, as the molybdoenzyme nitrate reductase from e. coli  <cit>  cannot oxidize dihydrogen. instead of the selenate ligand, nitrate reductase has an oxo ligand to the mo, which is contributed by an aspartate residue. in this regard, however, it should be noted that although the third formate dehydrogenase fdh-h also has similar active site geometry to fdh-n  <cit> , we could not detect a dihydrogen-activating activity associated with this enzyme in our gel system. in contrast to other molybdopterin-containing molybdoenzymes catalyzing oxo-transfer of the oxygen from h2o to the substrate, fdh-h, and presumably also fdh-n and fdh-o, catalyze the direct release of co <dig> and not bicarbonate from formate  <cit> . the transfer of the proton from formate to a histidine and concomitant reduction of mo to mo facilitates direct release of co <dig> with the cofactor returning to the oxidized mo state after electron transfer to the iron-sulfur cluster  <cit> . such a dehydrogenation reaction could explain the inefficient oxidation of h <dig> by fdh-n/o demonstrated here. future studies will focus on testing this hypothesis to characterize the mechanism of dihydrogen activation.

CONCLUSIONS
the energy-conserving formate dehydrogenases of e. coli can use dihydrogen as an enzyme substrate. apart from the -hydrogenases, these enzymes were the only ones in extracts of anaerobically grown e. coli that could oxidize hydrogen and transfer the electrons to benzyl viologen or phenazine methosulfate/nitroblue tetrazolium. while the possible significance of this activity to the general anaerobic physiology of e. coli remains to be established, this finding has potentially important implications for our understanding of the hydrogen metabolism of other anaerobic microorganisms.
