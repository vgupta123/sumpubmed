BACKGROUND
the adrenal gland is known as a key organ playing an important role in the blood pressure regulation and hypertension development. the adrenal gland produces corticosteroid hormones and catecholamines that regulate a complex set of vital organismic functions including the stress control, water and sodium balance, cardiovascular system and the blood pressure  level  <cit> . that’s why the adrenal gland is an object of choice in a number of studies directed to elucidate the complex nature of hypertensive disease development or neuroendocrine profile related to stress response .

different animal models of arterial hypertension help to analyze the transcriptome of the adrenal glands and to uncover common genetic mechanisms of hypertension across mammalian species that might, therefore, be pertinent to human hypertension too  <cit> .

the isiah rat strain is a model of stress-sensitive arterial hypertension with predominant involvement of the neuroendocrine hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical  and sympathetic adrenal systems  in pathogenesis of hypertension . the peripheral plasma aldosterone concentration and secretion rates of corticosterone, 11-dehydrocorticosterone and deoxycorticosterone measured by the adrenal vein cannulation were significantly higher in the isiah rats as compared to control wag rats  <cit> . the sympathetic adrenal medullary function assessed by measurement of the adrenal catecholamine content showed decreased concentrations of dopamine and norepinephrine, but significantly enhanced level of epinephrine in the adrenals of isiah rats  <cit> . it was suggested that the genetically determined enhanced stress responsiveness and hypertension development in isiah rats may be a result of the specificity of its adrenal gland function  <cit> .

the differences in the transcription activity of several genes measured in the adrenal glands of hypertensive isiah and control wag rats  <cit>  demonstrated that the selection of the isiah rat strain for the enhanced responsiveness to mild emotional stress could lead to accumulation of the genetic changes which may affect the hypertension development.

the goal of the current study was to compare the full transcriptome profiles of the adrenal glands from hypertensive isiah and normotensive wag rats in order to identify the main pathways involved in the differences of their adrenal gland functions, and to define the differentially expressed genes  which could make the largest contribution to the stress-sensitive hypertension development.

the current study of the comparative transcriptome profiling of the adrenal glands in hypertensive isiah and control wag rats resulted in the detection of multiple degs related to different biological processes and metabolic pathways. the use of the partial-least squares discriminant analysis  helped to reveal the top  <dig> degs associated with hypertension and making the most significant contribution to the inter-strain differences. several of these degs may be considered as potential candidates for further studies directed to better understanding the mechanisms of hypertension development in the isiah rats.

RESULTS
altogether,  <dig> genes were defined as expressed in adrenal glands of isiah and wag rats and were used in comparative expression analysis, which revealed  <dig> degs. the complete listing of degs is given in additional file  <dig>  the hierarchical clustering based on euclidean distance is shown in additional file  <dig>  more than half of the degs  were upregulated in isiah rats.

the expression of  <dig> genes was detected in adrenal gland of only one rat strain . three of these genes ) are known as related to hypertension development. their expression was detected in adrenal gland of isiah rats but not in the wag.

altogether, the study revealed  <dig> degs annotated in rat genome database  as related to hypertension . most of these genes  were upregulated in hypertensive adrenal glands. twenty three genes of those listed in table  <dig> are known as associated with insulin resistance. almost all of them  were upregulated in adrenals from isiah rats.table  <dig> genes differentially expressed in isiah and wag adrenal glands and referred to in rat genome database as associated with hypertension

the most abundant group described by go term ‘response to stimulus’ consisted of groups related to response to different stimuli - external stimulus, endogenous  stimulus, and stress, which were found to be among the most significantly enriched go terms. the group of degs labelled ‘response to hormone stimulus’, consisted of subgroups of degs related to response to steroid hormone stimulus , response to growth hormone, and insulin stimuli. the response to stress was specified by the group of genes related to response to oxygen levels. almost all genes  in this group were related to response to hypoxia.

several groups of degs related to bp control were found. these were: regulation of body fluid levels, blood circulation, blood coagulation, regulation of bp, regulation of angiogenesis and blood vessel size, regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation and contraction.

several other processes, which may play an important role in stress-sensitive hypertension development in isiah rats were: regulation of catecholamine secretion, glucose homeostasis, regulation of insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling pathway, oxidation reduction, calcium ion homeostasis, regulation of neurological system process .

multiple degs were related to transport  and regulation of transport. the differences of adrenal gland functioning in hypertensive isiah and normotensive wag rats were also found to be under control of many genes involved in homeostatic process, lipid metabolic process, intracellular signaling cascade, cell adhesion and extracellular matrix organization, endocytosis, apoptosis, and the regulation of these biological processes.

the immune system process and its regulation were also among the most abundant and significantly enriched groups. multiple degs were associated with inflammatory and adaptive, innate, and humoral immune responses.

among the  <dig> significantly enriched  kegg  pathways identified in the current study, there were several associated with the function of immune system . the other were related to complement and the blood coagulation cascades, ppar signaling pathway, ecm-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, chemokine signaling pathway, glutathione metabolism. all of these pathways contained genes associated with hypertension and metabolic diseases.

the partial-least squares discriminant analysis  was performed to identify the genes making the greatest impact to inter-strain differences. the constructed pls-da axes maximized the distances between rats from two strains , and the pearson correlation calculated between gene expression and pls-da axis  <dig> helped to determine the distribution of the genes along the axis representing the correlation between gene expression and pls-da axis  <dig> . the degs are shown in red in fig.  <dig>  and their polar position in the histogram assumes their contribution to the inter-strain differences. the  <dig> degs at the most polar position, which are known as associated with hypertension and showing greater than  <dig> fold differences in their level of transcription in the adrenal glands of isiah and wag rats, were considered as the degs contributing the most to the inter-strain variations . the differential transcription of these top  <dig> degs was validated by qpcr . the comparison of the relative mrna abundance between the rna-seq and qpcr measurements is represented in additional file  <dig>  the results obtained from the two methods were highly similar, with a calculated correlation coefficient of  <dig> .fig.  <dig> axes maximizing the distances between isiah and wag rats

discussion
the transcriptome profiling of the adrenal glands from isiah and wag rats let to identify multiple degs and several pathways contributing to differences between the adrenal gland functions in isiah rats with stress-sensitive hypertension and normotensive controls.

the study revealed several genes with detected transcription in adrenal gland of only one rat strain. three of them , known as associated with hypertension, were expressed only in adrenal glands from hypertensive rats. however, the low levels of expression of these genes were reported in adrenals from normotensive fischer  <dig> male rats, too  <cit> . so, the inter-strain differences in transcriptional activity of these genes shouldn’t be essential for hypertension development in isiah rats.

the specificity of the stress-sensitive hypertension may be seen from the functional annotation of degs performed in database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery . the analysis showed that the group of degs described by go term ‘response to stimulus’ was one of the most abundant. this could be a priori expected for the stress-induced models of hypertension, as the adrenal gland is a component of the hpa and sympathetic-adrenal medullary axes, which are both involved in neuroendocrine response to stress  <cit> . however, in the current experiment, the rats were studied at rest condition. so, we may suggest that among the degs related to response to stimulus there should be those particular ones which define the predominant activation of the hpa and the sympathetic adrenal medullary axes in the pathogenesis of the hypertensive state in isiah rats selected for the enhanced bp in response to the mild emotional stress   <cit> .

earlier in the study of the adrenal medulla transcriptome in sprague-dawley rats it was reported that multiple transcription factors were upregulated in response to the acute immobilization stress  <cit> . in the current experiment, the group of degs, associated with the go term ‘response to stimulus’ in isiah rats, also contained multiple transcription factor genes most of which  were upregulated. in the experiment with gene transcriptional profiling after acute immobilization stress in the adrenal medulla from the sprague-dawley rats  <cit>  and in the current study we found  <dig> common transcription factor genes , with nr4a <dig> and ppard being upregulated in both experiments. the orphan nuclear receptor, nor- <dig>  was reported as a target of beta-adrenergic signaling in skeletal muscles  <cit> . taking all the information together, we may hypothesize that the enhanced transcriptional activity of nr4a <dig> may be related to the predominant activation of the sympathetic-adrenal medullary axis in isiah rats. to our knowledge, the role of the sympathetic nervous system in activation of ppard has not been described up to date, however, its important role may be expected from the study of the acute immobilization stress response of the adrenal glands in sprague-dawley rats  <cit> .

the adrenal medullary tissue contributes to maintain body homeostasis in stressful environment via the release of catecholamines into circulatory system in response to splanchnic nerve activation  <cit> . the acetylcholine released by the sympathetic splanchnic nerves activates neuronal-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors  on the membrane of chromaffin cells which liberate catecholamines into the bloodstream in preparation for the fight and flight reactions  <cit> . in the current study several degs involved in the regulation of catecholamine secretion were found , including chrna <dig> . however, chrna <dig> was downregulated in isiah adrenals. besides, one more gene in this group, cartpt  known as activating sympathoadrenal outflow  <cit> , was also decreased. these findings suggest the involvement of the chrna <dig> and cartpt genes in compensatory mechanism directed to attenuate the catecholamine release by the adrenals of isiah rats.

the predominantly increased effectiveness of the hpa axis in the isiah rats may be related to the degs participating in response to hormonal stimuli. most of the degs in this group  were upregulated in the adrenal glands from isiah rats , and about half of them are known as associated with hypertension. three of these degs  were reckoned among the top  <dig> degs making the most significant contribution to the inter-strain differences .

v1a receptor  plays an important role in the basal arterial bp maintenance by regulation of circulating blood volume and baroreflex sensitivity  <cit> . vasopressin is a potent autocrine/paracrine regulator of mammal adrenal functions. v1a receptor is expressed both in adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla. in the adrenal cortex v1a receptor triggers both steroid secretion and cortical growth  <cit> . besides, v1a receptor is present in vascular smooth muscles and is responsible for the classical vasopressor action of vasopressin  <cit> . the avpr1a upregulation in the isiah adrenal glands may indicate the exaggerated effects on multiple adrenal functions in isiah rats.

our previous studies confirmed the reduced activity of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type  <dig>  in adrenal glands of isiah rats  <cit>  and in peripheral blood plasma  <cit> . it was shown that the loss-of-function mutations or inhibition of 11β-hsd <dig> results in overstimulation of the mineralocorticoid receptor by glucocorticoids and causes salt-sensitive hypertension  <cit> . taking into account the decreased level of hsd11b <dig> transcription and its protein activity in adrenal glands and other tissues of isiah rats, which resulted in decrease of 11-dehydrocorticosterone/corticosterone ratio in peripheral blood plasma, we may suggest the importance of this mechanism in stress-sensitive hypertension development, too.

the decreased transcription of igf <dig> in isiah adrenals is in a good agreement with the observation that igf <dig> expression may be significantly decreased in the presence of hypertension  <cit> . an increase in the igf <dig> production was reported in rats undergoing the compensatory growth of the adrenal gland following the unilateral adrenalectomy  <cit> . as the weight of the adrenal glands is significantly higher in isiah rats as compared to wag rats  <cit> , we suggest that the decreased transcription of igf <dig> in isiah adrenals may be adaptive.

the data of the current study revealed also many other degs associated with hypertension and metabolic diseases, the main feature of which is insulin resistance. adrenocortical dysregulation is considered as a major player in insulin resistance and onset of obesity  <cit> . it is believed that insulin resistance is directly correlated with the severity of hypertension  <cit>  and may account for the etiology of essential hypertension in as many as half of the patients with the disease  <cit> . in the current study, three degs associated with both hypertension and insulin resistance , member 1) were put on the list of the top  <dig> degs making the most significant contribution to the inter-strain differences .

angiotensinogen is the substrate of renin and the precursor of the angiotensin peptides having the powerful vasoconstrictive properties. the activation of renin-angiotensin system  is considered not only as a main hypertensive system, but also as a key factor triggering reactive oxygen species production, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and hypertension development  <cit> . the elevated transcription of the agt gene in isiah adrenal glands points out the involvement of the adrenal tissue ras in the development of stress-sensitive hypertension. however, our data differ from those previously reported for spontaneously hypertensive rats . it was shown that adrenal angiotensinogen mrnas were lower in shr than in control wky rats at 14 weeks of age  <cit> . this discrepancy is probably one of the features distinguishing the mechanism of hypertension development in isiah rats from that in shrs.


ephx <dig> encodes the soluble epoxide hydrolase  that metabolizes the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, which produce vasorelaxation and exert anti-inflammatory and pro-fibrinolytic effects  <cit> . seh was linked to hypertension in the studies on different animal models of the disease: spontaneous  <cit> , angiotensin ii-induced  <cit> , and programmed hypertension  <cit> . soluble epoxide hydrolase deficiency improves glucose homeostasis in a model of insulin resistance  <cit> . taking into account the above information, we may suggest that ephx <dig> activation may contribute to disease development in isiah rats.

the plasminogen activator inhibitor  <dig> , known as coagulation marker, has been found to correlate with all components of the insulin resistance syndrome, and can be considered as a true component of the metabolic syndrome  <cit> . increased plasma pai <dig> may be involved in the occurrence of micro-vascular complications and increased risk of atherosclerosis  <cit> . the inhibition of pai <dig> results in reduction of cell adhesion and cellular proliferation, particularly in reduction of angiogenesis  <cit> . so, decreased transcription of the serpine <dig> in isiah adrenals may work against the excessive development of angiogenesis and micro-vascular complications in stress-sensitive hypertension.

as long as the pls regression method is commonly used for biomarker selection in metabolomic  <cit>  and gene expression  <cit>  studies, the other degs listed in the table  <dig>  may also be indicated as deserving a high priority in future investigations of molecular mechanisms of the stress-sensitive hypertension. their possible contribution to the disease development in isiah rats is discussed below.

metabotropic gabab receptors  abundantly expressed at inhibitory and excitatory synapses are mostly studied in the brain, where they play an important role in modulating synaptic transmission by their presynaptic inhibitory effects on calcium channels and postsynaptic activating effects on potassium channels  <cit> . it was also shown that activation of gababrs protects neurons from apoptosis via igf <dig> receptor transactivation  <cit> . however, gamma-aminobutyric acid  is produced not only in the brain, but also in endocrine cells including rat adrenal medullary chromaffin cells. since there are no gabaergic nerve fibers in the adrenal medulla, gaba may function as a para/autocrine factor  <cit> . the functional role of the elevated transcription of gabbr <dig> in adrenal glands is not known and has to be studied, as it might be essential for stress-sensitive hypertension development in isiah rats.

myeloperoxidase  delays neutrophil apoptosis and prolongs inflammation  <cit> . the activation of mpo may contribute to the development of obesity and obesity-associated insulin resistance  <cit> . so, it may be expected that the elevated mpo transcription found in isiah adrenals in the current study may contribute to insulin resistance and inflammation in isiah rats, too.


s100b expression is studied mostly in the central nervous system, where the role of s <dig> beta is related to the development and maintenance of neuronal function  <cit> . s <dig> beta may influence the cell survival in a concentration-dependent manner  <cit> . recently, it was reported that the decreased expression of s <dig> beta may be associated with the neuroprotective mechanism against acute stress  <cit> . so, the role of the s100b decreased transcription in adrenal glands of isiah rats may be associated with the sympathetic nervous system regulation of the stress-sensitivity in isiah rats.


serpine <dig> encodes serine  proteinase inhibitor, clade e, member  <dig>  which is associated with the negative regulation of blood coagulation  <cit> .

as it is seen from the above discussion, the top  <dig> degs making the most significant contribution to the inter-strain differences  possess different functional properties and may contribute to many physiological mechanisms possibly related to hypertension development in isiah rats. four of these degs  were related to go term group 'regulation of bp'. among the other members of this group there was the transcription factor pparg.

the pathway enrichment analysis in kegg database showed that the ppar  signaling pathway was among the most significantly enriched in the current study. the degs related to this pathway were mostly upregulated in isiah adrenal glands . among the upregulated degs there were  <dig> genes associated with hypertension, including the adipoq and lpl genes encoding adiponectin and lipoprotein lipase, which are recognized as an indicators for ppar-gamma activation . in the current study two genes  encoding the members of the ppar subfamily of nuclear receptors were upregulated.

the physiological role of ppars is related to lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis  <cit> . ppar-gamma has been implicated in the pathology of numerous diseases including insulin resistance, diabetes, atherosclerosis and hypertension  <cit> . ppar-gamma activation attenuates insulin resistance and inflammation  <cit> . ppar-delta activation ameliorates obesity and insulin resistance  <cit> , and has been considered as a potential therapeutic target in treatment of lipid-related disorders, including dyslipidemia and diabetes  <cit> .

earlier it was shown that the hypertension development in isiah rats is accompanied by dislipidemia, increased glucose content, increased body weight, and enhanced dna-binding activity of several transcription factors including ppars in liver. these data suggested the development of metabolic syndrome in isiah rats  <cit> . probably, the elevated transcription of pparg and ppard in the adrenal gland of isiah rats plays adaptive role and is directed to the attenuation of the processes leading to the metabolic syndrome development.

both go and kegg analyses indicated the high impact of the immune system processes on the formation of the interstrain differences in isiah and wag rats . multiple degs associated with go term ‘immune system process’ are annotated in rgd as associated with hypertension. the important role of inflammation and immunity in development of the stress-sensitive hypertension was already highlighted in our previous comparative studies of genome-wide transcriptome analyses of hypothalamus and renal cortex from isiah and wag rats  <cit> . a growing body of research supporting a role of inflammation and immunity in hypertension was recently summarized in multiple reviews . many of the authors reviewing the problem consider that cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system contribute to end-organ damage and dysfunction in hypertension, and the molecular determinants of the immune cells activation may be a putative therapeutic targets to reduce end-organ damage and prevent pathological consequences of hypertension  <cit> . the results of our study are in a good agreement with these opinions and may be useful to define the common molecular determinants, which may be recognized as potential targets for therapy and prevention of hypertensive disease.

CONCLUSIONS
recently, the molecular studies of the pathogenesis of genetic hypertension strongly highlighted the complex nature of the disease. the current study of the comparative transcriptional profiling of the adrenal glands in isiah rats with the stress-sensitive arterial hypertension and control wag rats resulted in detection of multiple degs related to different endocrine, inflammatory, neural, and metabolic processes and pathways. the discussion of the results helped to prioritize the following genes.

two transcription factor genes  were found to be common and upregulated both in adrenal of isiah rats and in the adrenal medulla from the sprague-dawley rats after acute immobilization stress. we suggest that the upregulation of these genes may be related to the predominant activation of the sympathetic-adrenal medullary axis in isiah rats; however, their real contribution to the hypertensive phenotype remains to be demonstrated.

the use of the pls-da helped to reveal a number of degs making the most significant contribution to the inter-strain differences. the discussion of ten of them known as associated with hypertension demonstrated that four of these genes  may provoke the hypertension development, and mpo may contribute to insulin resistance and inflammation in isiah rats. these degs may be considered as the most promising candidates for further studies of the mechanisms underlying the stress-sensitive hypertension development.

it was not possible to discuss the functional roles for all the degs found in the current study. the differential expression of the genes not necessary must be related to hypertensive phenotype. so, the attention was mostly paid to the discussion of the degs already known as associated with hypertension, which could be considered as the most potentially interesting candidates for further studies of the mechanisms underlying the stress-sensitive hypertension development. however, the list of genes associated with hypertension is permanently expanding. thus, we can’t exclude that the other genes found to be differentially expressed in isiah and wag adrenal glands may also influence the development of hypertensive phenotype.

the results of the current study may be useful to identify the common molecular determinants in different animal models of arterial hypertension and to define the potential targets for therapy and prevention of hypertensive disease.
