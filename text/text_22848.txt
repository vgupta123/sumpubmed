BACKGROUND
in recent years, rice genomics has progressed substantially and generated considerable valuable resources, including availability of two independent genome sequences  <cit>  and a composite physical map  <cit> . these resources provide a foundation for understanding the tremendous genetic diversity that exists in rice. among organisms for which a high-quality genome sequence from at least one individual is available, such as human, mouse, and arabidopsis, genome-wide surveys of single nucleotide polymorphisms  have captured significant proportions of within-species variation  <cit> . similarly, the rice research community has migrated to snps as the main measure of genetic variation in rice, with initiation of the oryzasnp project , and subsequently ~ <dig>  nonredundant snps distributed across the entire genome of the oryzasnpset have been discovered  <cit> . the abundant snps can be used to design more targeted snp assays for immediate use in rice genetics and molecular breeding  <cit> , particularly in genome-wide association study   <cit> .

however, genomics research has revealed other forms of genetic variations, such as copy number variation  in human  <cit> , chimpanzee  <cit> , dog  <cit> , chicken  <cit> , cattle  <cit> , pig  <cit> , rat  <cit> , mouse  <cit> , drosophila <cit> , caenorhabditis elegans <cit> , yeast  <cit> , escherichia coli <cit> , maize  <cit> , and arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . cnv is defined as a segment of dna ≥ <dig> kb that is variable in copy number in comparison with a reference genome  <cit> . cnv covers more base-pairs  <cit>  and has a higher per-locus mutation rate than snps  <cit> . previous studies indicated that cnvs are in variable linkage disequilibrium  with flanking snps  <cit> .

high levels of cnv have been found throughout the rice genome  <cit> , and recent study provided insight into the extent of genome-wide structural variations in the important representative restorer lines  <cit> . herein we describe a more detailed survey undertaken to detect candidate cnvs in a panel of  <dig> asian cultivated rice comprising six indica, three aus, two rayada, two aromatic, three tropical japonica, and four temperate japonica , and examine the genome-wide characteristics of cnvs in subspecies and groups. these resources allowed us to analyze genetic diversity as indicated by cnvs, to evaluate the biological roles of cnvs, and to identify candidate cnvs that are likely to occur independently in subspecies and contribute to the genetic differences among groups.

RESULTS
detection of cnvs in asian cultivated rice
we performed array-comparative genomic hybridization  covering the entire rice reference genome sequence of ssp. japonica nipponbare . dna samples from nipponbare, as the reference sample, were fixed in all hybridization experiments. genomic dna from  <dig> accessions of asian cultivated rice was tested against the nipponbare reference sample. we used an updated version of a previously described method to identify changes in log <dig> signal intensity corresponding to copy number gains and losses  <cit> . under our conservative calling criteria, self-to-self hybridization showed no detectable false-positives. figure  <dig> compares the linearized whole-genome karyogram of ir  <dig> to that of a self–self , and shows the whole chromosome  <dig> in greater detail. using a set of stringent criteria, a total of  <dig>  cnvs in the  <dig> cultivars were identified, with an average of  <dig>  per cultivar, ranging from  <dig> cnvs in geumobyeo to  <dig> cnvs in dv  <dig> . a higher number of cnv events were detected in ssp. indica  than in ssp. japonica  . however, among ssp. japonica cultivars, more cnv events were detected in tropical japonica  than in temperate japonica  . analysis of variance  indicated that cnv length did not vary significantly among the cultivars , with  <dig> % of the cnv lengths within  <dig> kb.

identification and distribution of copy number variable regions
by merging overlapping cnvs identified in all cultivars across the acgh  <cit> ,  <dig> high-confidence copy number variable regions  were identified, which covered  <dig>  mb of the rice genome . the cnvrs consisted of  <dig> losses and  <dig> gains in copy number, and  <dig> with both events. furthermore,  <dig> cnvrs  were detected in only one cultivar , whereas the remaining cnvrs  were detected in two or more cultivars . however, more cnvrs were predicted to be present in ssp. japonica than in ssp. indica , which was inconsistent with the analysis of cnvs. the discrepancy may be attributable to the higher density of cnvs and fewer ssp. indica cultivars sampled.

the cnvrs were distributed throughout all  <dig> rice chromosomes . the length of cnvrs differed significantly among different chromosomes, and the percentage of entire chromosomes susceptible to cnvrs ranged from  <dig> % on chromosome  <dig> to  <dig> % on chromosome  <dig>  although chromosome  <dig> spanned only  <dig> % of the probes on the whole genome microarray, it included  <dig> % of the cnvrs identified and thus showed the greatest enrichment for cnvs with ~ <dig> -fold the average variable content of the genome. there was little correlation between cnv occurrence and chromosome length , which is consistent with previous studies on the heterogeneous distribution of cnvs throughout the genome  <cit> .

overlap of cnvs with segmental duplications  and other repeat contents
when we intersected the  <dig> cnvrs with rice sd regions,  <dig> %  of the cnvrs directly overlapped with sds. a reason is that only a unique sequence is spotted in the oligonucleotide array. this selectively omits or reduces the probe density in sds. the regions identified as deletions relative to the reference sample were analyzed for repeat content  for each chromosome . the most common classes of tes  and other repetitive sequences, such as simple repeat sequences and other unclassified repeats, were identified in the majority of regions  . of these regions,  <dig> contained ltr retrotransposons and  <dig> contained no dna tes. although differences in the number within each te class at specific locations varied widely, ltr retrotransposons were the predominant class  followed by dna tes . in addition, sines and lines were identified on all chromosomes and only in  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively, of all deleted regions. the largest sequence length within the line signatures was  <dig> bp. chromosome  <dig> contained only five lines.

differentiation of subspecies by cnvs
hierarchical clustering was performed to explore relationships among the  <dig> asian cultivated rice based on the cnvs . unsupervised clustering of the acgh log <dig> ratio of all probes in the  <dig> cnvrs supported known rice relationships and partially clustered samples consistent with previous studies  <cit> , which indicated that those cnvs shared among samples may be indicators of a common evolutionary history and genetic relationship. however, the two rice subspecies, indica and japonica, did not form separate clusters. this result might be an artifact of the measurements being based on a common reference sample , or the cnvs may be less phylogenetically reliable than neutral markers by reason of stronger selective constraints  <cit> .

the approximate number of alleles was estimated using powermarker v <dig>  software. nei’s genetic diversity index  value for ssp. indica and ssp. japonica at every polymorphic cnvr was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. this was expected on the basis of previous findings that ssp. indica contains higher genetic diversity than ssp. japonica <cit> . to better understand how cnv contributes to intra-subspecies diversity, we searched for cnvrs that exhibited high levels of heterozygosity and identified  <dig> cnvrs with higher diversity in one or both subspecies . for example, one cnvr  was identified to be polymorphic in both subspecies. we queried the gene content of this region; interestingly, it contained no known gene. the distribution of fst across all cnvrs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  , with an average fst value of  <dig> , which was slightly lower than estimates reported in previous studies in which global germplasm collections were used in combination with snp or ssr data  <cit> .

by further assessing the frequency of events separately observed in ssp. indica and ssp. japonica,  <dig> %  of the variants were observed only in ssp. indica or ssp. japonica, but many of these were unique to one cultivar of ssp. indica or ssp. japonica . only one cnvr  was observed in all ssp. indica cultivars and no cnvr was observed in all ssp. japonica cultivars . this cnvr also overlapped in a previous acgh analysis of guangluai  <dig> and nipponbare  <cit>  and contained a subtilase gene os01g <dig>  a member of the superfamily of subtilisin-like serine proteases  <cit> .

to visualize the distribution of both deletions and amplifications within the six groups of cultivars, event frequencies were analyzed by hierarchical clustering . the clustering identified variants that were restricted to certain groups and those that were present in multiple groups. of  <dig> cnvrs with high frequency differences among groups ,  <dig> % corresponded to  <dig> annotated genes or gene families, of which some are important in rice adaptation, including a nb-arc domain-containing protein. on the basis of differences in cnv frequency among the groups, we hypothesize that some cnvs arose independently within different groups and contribute to group differences, and therefore are associated with group formation and adaptation.

gene content of cnvs
a total of  <dig> genes were identified as entirely affected by cnvs, which included  <dig> genes that were completely duplicated and  <dig> that were completely deleted. five gene-loss events among the  <dig> asian cultivated rice were chosen at random for pcr validation, namely os01g <dig> , os10g <dig> , os11g <dig> , os07g <dig> , and os12g <dig>  . given that the breakpoint definition of cnvrs can be equivocal, some of the gene sequences might partially overlap rather than be encompassed by cnvrs. nevertheless,  <dig> annotated genes wholly or partially spanned  <dig> %  of the  <dig> cnvrs , of which  <dig>  were non-protein-coding transcripts. overall we found that  <dig> %  of the genes identified were gene family members in the rice reference genome.

gene ontology  analysis of the  <dig> overlapping annotated genes indicated that the functional classes of genes that were enriched within the  <dig> cnvrs were cell death, protein phosphorylation, and defense response genes. we also identified orthologous genes of maize and arabidopsis based on homolog clustering . the  <dig> rice-specific genes affected by cnv included  <dig> for which no additional homologs were found within rice and  <dig> that were in multigene families. the remaining  <dig> genes were conserved in maize and/or arabidopsis.

discussion
characterization of cnvs in asian cultivated rice
several factors affected estimation of the number of cnvs detected between different rice cultivars against nipponbare. first, the array designs target only the sequences present in the nipponbare genome, and therefore we could not detect the sequences present in other rice cultivars but absent from nipponbare. second, a portion of the significant differences in hybridization signals may be due to the presence of multiple polymorphisms within the probe sequence between the reference and test sample genome. to reduce errors in cnv detection because of snps, we used a secondary manual method to examine all aberrant segments and to remove presumptive false-positives caused by single outlier probes and ensured all probes of each aberrant segment met a log <dig> ratio cut-off. as a consequence of this approach, our method for detection of cnvs was biased toward detection of small cnvs. finally, self–self hybridization showed appreciable variability, but a set of conservative calling criteria for the final set of high-confidence cnvs showed no false-positives for self–self control hybridizations. nonetheless, it is desirable to map the locations of the breakpoints with as high a degree of accuracy as possible.

we compared the  <dig> cnvrs detected with  <dig> candidate cnvs reported previously using re–sequencing results from  <dig> accessions of cultivated and wild rice  <cit> . the majority of the variants identified in these two studies do not overlap. in addition to the differences in detection technology, we suspect that the main reasons for this discordance are  differences in the accessions analyzed in the two studies, and  genome coverage biases—only unique sequences were spotted in our oligonucleotide array. this approach selectively omits or reduces probe density in cnv-enriched regions, such as sds and diverse repetitive sequences  <cit> . in addition, it may also indicate that the cnvs detected using different technological and analytical platforms show large variation in cnv resolution, which may affect cnv sizes.

previous studies have reported a strong association between cnvs and sds in human  <cit> , chimpanzee  <cit> , mouse  <cit> , and cattle  <cit> . in contrast, when we compared the  <dig> cnvrs derived from acgh data with rice sd regions, only  <dig> %  of the events overlapped with rice sds. we suspect that the probe specificity in our arrays might severely interfere with cnv discovery. in the future, cgh arrays with unbiased genome coverage combined with improved cnv calling algorithms could remedy this imperfection.

a notable feature of the rice genome is that ltr retrotransposons were identified in  <dig> % of the rice genome  <cit> , which suggests that ltr retrotransposons may be an important source of cnvs in rice. indeed, we performed a cursory analysis for te/repeat contents in regions that were identified as being deletions relative to the reference sample. we identified  <dig> regions that contained ltr retrotransposons, which comprised over  <dig> % of the total tes identified in the deleted regions. although these results are preliminary and require further analysis, they suggest that tes and repeats may have played a role in shaping the genomic architecture of cnvs in rice.

evidence for ancient whole-genome duplications in rice is reported  <cit> . the most recent segmental duplication event in rice occurred between chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> after differentiation of grasses  <cit> . this fact may explain why cnvr length differed significantly among different chromosomes, with larger cnvrs detected on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in the present study. more surprisingly, previous work shows that chromosome  <dig> is enriched with disease resistance genes  <cit> , which may be attributable to the higher number of cnvs on chromosome  <dig>  higher recombination rates and the presence of homologous gene clusters are probably predispositions for non-allelic homologous recombination  events, which tend to generate cnvs  <cit> .

differentiation of cnvs between ssp. indica and ssp. japonica
rice is traditionally classified into two subspecies, ssp. indica and ssp. japonica, on the basis of morphological characteristics, ecological adaptation, crossing ability and geographic origin  <cit> . in addition, evidence suggests that ssp. indica and ssp. japonica are the products of separate domestication events from the ancestral species, o. rufipogon <cit> . we investigated whether any cnvs are associated with ssp. indica–ssp. japonica differentiation. in our study,  <dig> %  of variants were observed only in ssp. indica or ssp. japonica. however, many of these ssp. indica- and ssp. japonica-specific events were observed in only one cultivar . therefore, the subspecies-specific variants are enriched for rare alleles and may represent relatively new events that have arisen within breeding populations. this is also consistent with the low proportion of long cnvs identified in our study. we hypothesize that these cnvs are associated with phenotypic diversity among rice cultivars, and further research is important to assess how these variants affect phenotype. we also searched for cnvs potentially associated with ssp. indica–ssp. japonica differentiation on the basis of high frequencies within ssp. indica and ssp. japonica. no variants were present in all ssp. japonica cultivars and not in any ssp. indica cultivar. only one variant was observed in all ssp. indica cultivars and not in any ssp. japonica cultivar. thus there was no evidence for strong effects of subspecies differentiation on structural variation. it should be noted that cnvs were documented based on comparison to a reference ssp. japonica genome, and therefore sequences present in the ssp. indica genome but not in the ssp. japonica genome were not detected. thus, we speculate that subspecies differentiation-associated cnvs would be expected to be present in most ssp. indica cultivars, but in few or no ssp. japonica cultivars.

insights into asian cultivated rice relationships based on high-density cnv data
generally, the population structure of domesticated species is influenced by the evolutionary history of the predomesticated ancestors, as well as by the complexity of breeding practices  <cit> . strong selective pressure during the process of rice domestication has led to the formation of population substructure  <cit> . in some studies, the two subspecies have been further divided into five major groups  on the basis of snp and indel data  <cit> . in the present study, hierarchical clustering of cnvs indicated that the variation segregating with major rice groups was present in the samples of a rice group. however, smaller groups are adapted to specific ecosystems, which may be recognized as upland, deep water, or floating cultivars  <cit> . evidence suggests that rayada is less amenable to ex situ conservation because of their adaptation to deep water. this may be one reason why the two rayada cultivars did not cluster together in the present study.

we conservatively queried cnvrs that have high-confidence frequency differences among groups. the allele frequencies that we observed for structural variants suggested that some variants have been removed entirely from certain groups. the specific regions may be related to diversification within specific rice groups. further screening is necessary to confirm that these cnvs are truly group-specific. this finding also implies that those loss events detected exclusively in one group will limit the potential for genetic improvement through selection within that group only.

implications for biological roles for cnvs
it is generally assumed that individuals of the same species have very similar genome contents. rice is autogamous and has relatively low nucleotide polymorphism rates compared to other crop species. however, the acgh indicates that considerable genomic variation exists in asian cultivated rice. moreover, this variation may include substantial differences in gene content and gene structure, as was observed in the gene deletion analysis of the pcr data in the present study. in addition to  <dig> genes entirely encompassed by a cnv, some additional genes partially overlapped. this result could be explained by biological and technical factors. in addition to changes in gene dosage, the main mechanisms responsible for the potential effects of cnvs include reshaping of the gene structure and modification of the elements that regulate gene expression  <cit> . in addition, probe space and stringent criteria for cnv calling may limit coverage of the full length of genes. notably, the array design is based on the older reference genome , so additional variant genes would not be identifiable if they reside in regions that were additions to the most recent version of the genome sequence. collectively, these data suggest that the true number of genes may be substantially larger than the  <dig> genes we identified in this study.

high levels of structural variation in plant genomes is related to important quantitative variation  <cit> . for example, fine mapping, complementation testing, and association analysis of a recently identified quantitative trait locus, qsw <dig>  indicated that a deletion in qsw <dig> resulted in a significant increase in sink size owing to an increase in cell number in the outer glume of the rice flower  <cit> . as was demonstrated in maize, cnvs are also important in plant disease responses by directly affecting causative genes  <cit> . similarly, it is important to evaluate the effect of such structural variation on phenotypic plasticity in rice cultivars, groups and subspecies. although there was no obvious phenotypic implication in the present study, a marked enrichment of genes for cell death, protein phosphorylation, and defense response may reflect the importance of cnvs in biological processes. we identified many disease resistance genes within the cnvrs. this is expected because, first, gene families with functions in regulatory processes and signal recognition, such as disease resistance, have higher nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution ratios  <cit> . this result, as for the over-represented set of disease resistance genes, might indicate a relaxation of constraints because of the redundancy expected from the variable number of gene copies  <cit> . specifically, sequences encoding leucine-rich repeat and nb-arc domains are common in plant disease resistance proteins, which are particularly diverse because of pathogen pressure  <cit> . second, the loss of a single member of a gene family may result in a relatively minor loss of the total function of the gene family, because other family members may genetically cushion the impact. thus, cnv is likely to contribute to quantitative variation rather than qualitative defects in the complex and highly duplicated plant genome  <cit> . in addition, the gene content in cnvs is speculated to have contributed to heterosis during domestication  <cit> . indeed, high levels of variability in gene content among genotypes will result in hybrids that contain a higher number of genes than either parent. we observed in the present study that many of the rice cultivars were missing unequal numbers of genes relative to nipponbare. it may be possible to identify a series of recombination events in order to combine all superior alleles for heterosis, which would be valuable in breeding programs.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides insights into the mutational mechanisms and functional effects of cnvs in the rice genome. our results suggest that many cnvs are generated by nahr events from higher recombination rates and the presence of homologous gene clusters, which is consistent with previous work that chromosome  <dig> is enriched with disease resistance genes. we also identify candidate cnvs for involvement in group-specific characteristics. this comprehensive catalogue of cnvs will be useful for future studies to uncover the genetic basis of complex traits in rice.
