BACKGROUND
neuroinflammation has been reported in many progressive neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric brain illnesses, such as alzheimer’s disease, parkinson’s disease, hiv- <dig> dementia and bipolar disorder  <cit> . low-grade neuroinflammation can induce slow progressive cellular and tissue damage, whereas high-grade inflammation is associated with robust cytokine release. despite its pathophysiologic significance, molecular mechanisms underlying effects of low-grade and high-grade neuroinflammation are not fully understood.

six or 30 days of intracerebroventricular  low-dose bacterial lipopolysaccharide   infusion in rats produces behavioral deficits, induces amyloid deposits, and activates microglia and astrocytes  <cit> . low-dose lps infusion in rats increases arachidonic acid  turnover in brain phospholipids, brain activities of aa-selective cytosolic ca2+-dependent phospholipase a <dig>  type iva and of secretory phospholipase a <dig>  type ii, and concentrations of prostaglandin  e <dig>  pgd <dig> and thromboxane b <dig> metabolites  <cit> . however, net brain cyclooxygenase  activity, cox- <dig> and cox- <dig> protein levels, and calcium-independent phospholipase a <dig>  activity are unchanged with low-dose lps infusion  <cit> . depending on the infusion rate and duration, lps infusion has been reported to activate rat brain microglia and astrocytes, increase expression of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa b  and inflammatory cytokines, stimulate microglial inducible nitric oxide synthase activity  to produce nitric oxide, and increase brain glutamate  <cit> .

a 6-day icv infusion of high-dose lps  has been shown to increase activated microglia in the rat thalamus  <cit> , activities of cpla2-iva and spla2-iia, and unesterified aa and pge <dig> concentrations in rat brain  <cit> . the same high-dose lps infusion for 28 days increased mrna levels of interleukin- <dig> beta  and of tumor necrosis factor-alpha , reduced pyramidal cells in layers ii and iii of the entorhinal cortex, attenuated long-term potentiation , and impaired spatial memory in adult rats  <cit> .

synaptic proteins such as synaptophysin, drebrin and post-synaptic density- <dig>  play important roles in synaptic plasticity. drebrin is an actin-binding neuron-specific protein  <cit> , abundant within dendritic spines at postsynaptic excitatory synapses  <cit> . suppressing drebrin expression reduces spine density and results in the formation of thin immature dendritic spines  <cit> . thus, the drebrin-actin complex plays a crucial role in the regulation of dendritic spine morphology. synaptophysin is a 38-kd glycoprotein localized in presynaptic vesicle membranes. functions of synaptophysin include docking, fusion, and endocytosis, otherwise known as membrane trafficking  <cit> . psd- <dig> is a neuronal protein that associates with receptors and cytoskeletal elements at synapses, and is involved in regulating the number and size of dendritic spines and developing glutamatergic synapses  <cit> . changes in these synaptic markers have been used to evaluate neuronal damage  <cit> .

the impact of low- and high-dose lps infusion on brain aa cascade, neuroinflammatory and synaptic markers has not been examined consistently. therefore, we thought of interest to measure effects of the two doses of lps on aa, neuroinflammatory and synaptic markers in rat brain after a six-day lps infusion, compared to infusion of artificial cerebrospinal fluid . based on reported upregulated brain aa metabolism in the lps-infused rat brain, we hypothesized that 6-day icv infusion of low- and high-dose lps would increase expression of aa cascade and neuroinflammatory markers, and reduce pre- and post-synaptic markers such as synaptophysin and drebrin, in a dose-dependent manner. an abstract of some of this work has been presented  <cit> .

methods
animals
the study was conducted in accordance with the national institutes of health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals , and was approved by the animal care and use committee of the eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development. three-month-old male fischer f <dig> rats   were housed in a facility with controlled temperature, humidity, and 12-hour light/dark cycle. food  and water were provided ad libitum. the diet contained   <dig> % saturated,  <dig> % monounsaturated,  <dig> % linoleic,  <dig> % α-linolenic,  <dig> % aa,  <dig> % eicosapentaenoic, and  <dig> % docosahexaenoic acid  <cit> .

lps infusion
low-dose  or high-dose  of lps was infused icv in rats for 6 days as described previously  <cit> . the rationale for choosing the 6-day infusion period is based on a pilot study performed when measuring aa incorporation into brain at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 10 days of low-dose lps infusion. the study found no increase in total aa incorporation over control values until day  <dig>  of infusion. incorporation of aa reached a maximum at day  <dig> and remained elevated until day  <dig>  <cit> . we chose to infuse lps into the fourth ventricle based on earlier studies that showed activation of microglial cells by such lps infusion  <cit>  and of unregulated brain aa cascade markers  <cit> . briefly, the prefilled pump was placed in sterile  <dig> % nacl at 37°c overnight before surgery to start immediate pumping. acsf  or lps from escherichia coli  at a low or high dose was infused into the fourth ventricle through the cannula via an osmotic pump . postoperative care included triple antibiotic ointment applied to the wound; 5 ml of sterile  <dig> % nacl was injected subcutaneously to prevent dehydration during recovery. following 6 days of lps or acsf infusion, a rat was anesthetized with an overdose of co <dig>  and decapitated. the brain was rapidly excised, frozen in 2-methylbutane at −50°c, and stored at −80°c until use. the whole brain was cut into two hemispheres. one half of the brain was used for preparing cytosolic and nuclear extracts and the other half was used for extracting total rna. protein homogenates were prepared from the cerebrum and cerebellum without including the brainstem.

preparation of cytosolic and nuclear fractions
cytosolic and nuclear extracts were prepared from control , low- and high-dose lps-infused rats, as previously described  <cit> . briefly, brains were homogenized in 10 mm hepes, ph  <dig> ,  <dig>  mm edta,  <dig>  mm egta, 1 mm dithiothreitol , 10 mm kcl, and a protease inhibitor cocktail , using a teflon-glass homogenizer. after adding  <dig> % tergitol type np- <dig>  five additional strokes of homogenization were performed. the suspension was incubated for 30 min on ice, and then centrifuged in a microcentrifuge . the resulting supernatant was used as the cytosolic fraction. to the nuclear pellet, solution b  and a protease inhibitor cocktail  were added. the samples were mixed and placed on a small rotatory shaker for 30 min, then centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 3 min at 4°c. the supernatant containing the proteins from the nuclear extracts was transferred to a fresh tube. protein concentrations of cytosolic fractions and nuclear extracts were determined using bio-rad protein reagent .

western blot analysis
proteins from the cytosolic and nuclear fractions  were separated on 4-20% sds-polyacrylamide gels   and then electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane . cytosolic protein blots were incubated overnight in tbs containing 5% nonfat dried milk and  <dig> % tween- <dig>  with specific primary antibodies for il-1β , tnfα , glial fibrillary protein  , cd11b , ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1iba- <dig>  , inos , phosphorylated p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase   , cpla2-iva, spla2-iia, spla2-v, ipla2-via, cox- <dig> , cox- <dig> , cytochrome p <dig> epoxygenase , 5-, 12-, and 15-lipoxygenase  , psd- <dig> , drebrin  , synaptophysin, , and β-actin  . nuclear blots were incubated overnight in tbs containing 5% nonfat dried milk and  <dig> % tween- <dig>  with specific primary antibodies for specificity protein  <dig>   and nuclear export factor   . cytosolic blots were incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase -conjugated secondary antibodies  and were visualized using a chemiluminescence reaction  on x-ray film . optical densities of immunoblot bands were measured using alpha innotech software  and were normalized to β-actin  to correct for unequal loading. all experiments were carried out with  <dig> independent samples. values are expressed as percent of control.

total rna isolation and real time rt-pcr
total rna was isolated from half-brains using an rneasy lipid tissue mini kit . briefly, tissue was homogenized in qiagen lysis solution and total rna was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction. complementary dna was prepared from total rna using a high-capacity cdna archive kit . mrna levels  were measured by quantitative rt-pcr, using an abi prism  <dig> sequence detection system . specific primers and probes for these markers, purchased from taqmanr gene expression assays , consisting of a 20x mix of unlabeled pcr primers and taqman minor groove binder  probe . the fold-change in gene expression was determined by the ΔΔct method  <cit> . data are expressed as the relative level of the target gene in the lps-infused rat normalized to the endogenous control  and relative to the control . all experiments were carried out in duplicate with  <dig> control and  <dig> brain samples from lps-infused rats and data are expressed as relative expression.

transcription factor nf-κb p <dig> and nf-κb p <dig> activity
nuclear extracts were assayed for brain nf-κbp <dig> and nf-κbp <dig> activities according to the manufacturer’s instructions . briefly, 10 μg of nuclear extract was preincubated with biotin-labeled nf-κb p50/p <dig> for 60 min in a microfuge tube. the labeled oligonucleotide-nuclear protein complexes were transferred to immobilized streptavidin-coated 96-well plates. the bound oligonucleotide protein complex was detected by using a specific primary antibody directed against either nf-κb p <dig> or p <dig>  followed by addition of hrp-conjugated secondary antibody. color was developed by adding tetramethylbenzidine substrate, and optical densities were measured at 450 nm. values  are expressed as percent of control.

statistics
data are presented as mean ± sem. when three groups were compared , statistical significance was determined using a one-way anova with newman-keuls multiple comparison post-hoc test for multiple comparisons between the groups. statistical significance was set at p ≤  <dig> .

RESULTS
body weight
body weight  was significantly reduced by 9% and 19% in low-  and high-  dose lps-infused rats, respectively, compared to control , as previously reported  <cit> .

brain microglia, astrocyte markers and proinflammatory cytokines
six days of high-dose but not low-dose lps infusion significantly elevated the brain protein level  of the microglia/macrophage marker cd11b  <cit> , compared to control . consistent with that, a significant increase in the protein level of microglia marker iba- <dig> was found in high-dose but not low-dose lps infused rats . the astroglial marker gfap protein level was unchanged in rats infused with either lps dose compared to control . proinflammatory cytokine tnfα protein levels were significantly increased independently of the dose of lps  , whereas the il-1β protein level was unaltered . the protein level of inos, a major free radical-generating enzyme in activated microglia  <cit> , was increased significantly by 180% and 155%, with the low- and high-lps doses, respectively . these significant protein changes in cd11b, tnfα and inos did not correspond to significant changes in their respective mrna levels . further, there was no significant difference between low and high-dose lps infused rats in any neuroinflammatory marker.

brain arachidonic acid cascade markers
high-dose lps significantly increased phosphorylated cpla2-iva  as did low-dose lps   compared to control . the protein and mrna levels of cpla2-iva were significantly elevated by 178% and 2-fold, respectively, in rats infused with high-dose lps . high-dose lps significantly increased phospho-cpla <dig> and cpla <dig> levels compared to low-dose lps . spla2-v protein levels were significantly increased by 34% and 24% in low- and high-dose lps-infused rats respectively, compared to control , but without a significant change in spla2-v mrna . spla2-iia and ipla2-via protein levels were unaltered.

cox- <dig> protein  and mrna  levels were significantly elevated in rats infused with high- but not low-dose lps compared to controls , whereas cox-1protein was unchanged compared to control . high-dose lps significantly increased both cox- <dig> protein and mrna levels compared to low-dose lps infused rats . protein  and mrna levels of 5-lox  were significantly increased only with the high-dose lps infusion . protein levels of 12-lox, 15-lox and cytochrome p <dig> epoxygenase were unaltered by either lps infusion .

nf-κb activity and phosphorylated p <dig> mapk
dna-binding activity of nf-κbp <dig> was significantly increased  in the high-dose lps-infusion compared to control rats  , whereas nf-κbp <dig> dna-binding activity was unaltered . high-dose lps significantly increased nf-κbp <dig> activity compared to low-dose lps infused rats . active phosphorylated p <dig> mapk was significantly increased by 108% and 109% with low- and high-dose lps infusion, respectively, compared to control .

synaptic markers
protein levels of the presynaptic marker synaptophysin were significantly decreased by high-dose  and low-dose  lps, compared to control  . however, the mrna level of synaptophysin was significantly reduced  only by high-dose lps . postsynaptic marker drebrin protein  and mrna  levels were significantly reduced in high- but not low-dose lps infused rats compared to control . high-dose lps significantly decreased protein and mrna levels of synaptophysin and drebrin compared to low-dose lps infused rats . further, another marker of post-synaptic marker psd- <dig> was significantly decreased by high-dose lps but not low-dose lps . the protein levels of nxf, a transcription factor of drebrin  <cit> , and of sp- <dig>  a constitutive transcription factor of synaptophysin  <cit> , were unaltered .

discussion
the present study demonstrates that a 6-day icv infusion of low- or high-dose lps in unanesthetized rats, compared with acsf infusion, significantly increased brain levels of aa cascade and neuroinflammatory markers in a dose-dependent manner . these changes were associated with decreased levels of pre-and post-synaptic markers in a dose dependent manner as well. similar changes have been demonstrated in postmortem brain tissue from patients with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, aids and alzheimer’s disease  <cit> , suggesting that lps infusion at different rates in rats are reasonable models for understanding interactions of brain aa metabolism, neuroinflammation and synaptic integrity in these progressive human brain diseases, and perhaps for designing treatments for them  <cit> .

il-1β, gfap, ipla2-vi, spla2-iia, cox- <dig>  12- and 15-lox, cytochrome p <dig> epoxygenase, mpges, nf-κbp <dig>  nfx, and sp- <dig> were unchanged.

previously, we reported that a 6-day icv infusion of either lps dose increased cpla2-iv activity, but that the low-dose infusion did not alter the cpla2-iv protein level  <cit> . in the present study, although both lps doses increased phosphorylated cpla2-iva and phosphorylated p <dig> mapk , only the high-dose induced mrna and protein increases of cpla2-iva. these new data demonstrate that high-dose but not low-dose lps infusion induced transcriptional level activation. both doses also increased brain spla <dig> activity  <cit> , which can be ascribed to upregulated protein levels of spla2-v  <cit>  since spla2-iia protein was unchanged. in contrast, ca2+-independent docosahexaenoic acid -selective ipla2-via protein and mrna levels were not significantly altered by either dose of lps. this is consistent with evidence that neither lps infusion dose changed the brain unesterified dha concentration, dha turnover in brain phospholipids or ipla2-vi activity  <cit> .

the brain pge <dig> concentration was elevated in rats infused with both lps doses, consistent with increased concentration of unesterified aa released by cpla2-iva and spla2-v  <cit> . protein and mrna levels of cox- <dig>  the rate-limiting enzyme in pge <dig> biosynthesis, were upregulated with only the higher dose of lps, showing a dose-dependent effect. in line with a previous observation, low-dose lps infusion did not alter the brain cox- <dig> protein level  <cit> .

lox and cytochrome p <dig> epoxygenase convert aa to 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid /leukotrienes/lipoxins and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, respectively. the high-dose lps infusion increased 5-lox protein and mrna levels, without altering 12- or 15-lox levels. concentrations of 12-hete and 15-hete remain unchanged with both doses  <cit> . in this regard, lps has been reported to induce expression of 5-lox  <cit>  and the 5-lox-activating protein  via nf-κb-mediated transcriptional mechanisms in mononuclear phagocytes, which is critical for leukotriene synthesis  <cit> . another aa cascade marker, cytochrome p <dig> epoxygenase, remained unchanged after lps infusion.

cell culture studies have shown that two major cytokines, il-1β and tnfα, can induce transcription of cpla <dig>  spla <dig>  cox- <dig>  and inos genes through an nf-κb-mediated mechanism  <cit> , as nf-κb binding sites are present on the promoter regions of these genes  <cit> . our study suggesting that increases of cpla2-iva, cox- <dig>  and inos in high-dose lps-infused rats were due to elevated levels of tnfα following increased nf-κb p <dig> activity, was recently supported by in vitro studies  <cit> . the response was not observed in low-dose lps infusion. nf-κb p <dig> also is known to regulate transcription of many proinflammatory genes  <cit> . since p <dig> mapk can activate nf-κb mediated cell signaling  <cit> , the increases found in phosphorylated p <dig> mapk   <cit>  may be involved in lps-mediated nf-κb activation. these changes my induce tnfα and cox- <dig>  <cit> . nf-κb also can be activated by other cellular signal transduction factors, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase  or c-jun n-terminal kinase   <cit> .

consistent with the increased tnfα level, a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by microglia  <cit> , high-dose but not low-dose lps increased the microglia/macrophage marker cd11b, without altering the astroglial marker gfap. microglia but not astrocytes express the lps cd14/toll-like receptor  <dig>   <cit> , but we cannot rule out localized regional changes in brain gfap. indeed, we reported that low-dose lps increased lectin-reactive microglia in the cerebral ventricular surround, pia mater, and glial membrane of the cortex, and produced morphological changes of gfap-positive astrocytes in the cortical mantel and areas surrounding the cerebral ventricles  <cit> . an increase of cd11b with nf-κb-induced activation of cox- <dig> by high-dose lps infusion is consistent with the observation that cd11b plays a significant role in the optimal production of cox- <dig> via nf-κb  <cit> . since cd11b integrins originally were identified as lps receptors  <cit> , our data suggest that high-dose but not low-dose lps modifies the cd11b receptor. further, the microglial specific marker  <cit> , iba- <dig> was significantly increased in high-dose compared to low-dose lps infused rats, suggesting the presence of activated microglia in high-dose lps infused rats.

increases in tnfα and inos levels and in aa cascade enzyme expression have been implicated in neuronal damage  <cit>  and cognitive-behavioral impairments in rats infused with high doses of lps  <cit> . the latter impairments might be due to reduced expression of the postsynaptic dendritic spine actin-regulatory protein drebrin, which is involved in spinogenesis and synaptogenesis  <cit> . lps reduced the presynaptic vesicle marker synaptophysin in a dose-dependent manner. the molecular mechanisms by which neuroinflammation downregulate drebrin in rat brain are not clear. several studies reported that inhibition of p <dig> mapk activity prevented cytokine-induced loss of synaptophysin in rat primary cortical neuronal cultures and in an animal model of alzheimer’s disease  <cit> . similarly, drebrin loss was attributed to p <dig> mapk activity in hippocampal cultures  <cit> . apart from cytokines, pge <dig> is known to activate p <dig> mapk in rat primary astrocytes  <cit> . both lps doses increase the pge <dig> concentration in rat brain  <cit>  and may be involved in activating p <dig> mapk. increased p <dig> mapk activity observed in this study may explain the loss of synaptophysin following low- and high-dose lps infusion. interestingly, the increased p <dig> mapk may not be solely responsible for synaptic loss, because low-dose lps increased p <dig> mapk activity without changing the synaptic proteins. this suggests that other mechanisms are involved regulating the synaptic proteins. further specific in vitro studies are required to understand synaptic regulation by lps. both lps doses also did not change protein levels of nxf or sp- <dig>  transcription factors for drebrin and synaptophysin, respectively  <cit> . the changes in the synaptic markers might be related to post-transcriptional regulation or changes of other transcription factors/kinases  <cit> . consistent with loss of post-synaptic drebrin, the protein level of another postsynaptic marker psd- <dig> was decreased in high-dose lps infused rats compared to controls and low-dose infused rats.

a limitation of current study is that one time point  was taken to study the effects lps infusion based on the aa cascade metabolism. this choice was based on a prior study showing that aa incorporation in rat brain with low-dose lps infusion did not increase until day  <dig>  of infusion, reached a maximum at day  <dig> and remained elevated until day 10; no difference was evident at day  <dig>  <cit> . however, at earlier time points toll receptors and other pathways are activated  <cit> . future studies should aim at earlier and perhaps later time points.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that 6-day icv lps infusion dose-dependently increased neuroinflammatory and aa cascade markers associated with an increase in phosphorylated p <dig> mapk, and decreased synaptic markers . low-dose lps increased tnfα, inos, spla2-v, cpla2-iva and p <dig> mapk phosphorylation, and reduced presynaptic synaptophysin. high-dose lps upregulated gene expression of aa cascade enzymes via nf-κb, cd11b, and downregulated postsynaptic drebrin. targeting these disturbed pathways by specific anti-inflammatory drugs and/or cpla <dig> inhibitors could lead to therapeutic treatments of neuronal damage and behavioral changes associated with neuroinflammation  <cit> .
