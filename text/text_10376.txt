BACKGROUND
infection of the gastric mucosa with h. pylori results in a number of disease outcomes including gastritis, which precedes the development of peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer and lymphomas of the malt  <cit> . these diseases caused by h. pylori and their prevalence rates differ in different geographic countries and only a subset   <cit>  of infected patients develop one of them. this raises the question as to why h. pylori causes disease in a few individuals, but not in the great majority  <cit> .

many studies have demonstrated the involvement of bacterial virulence factors, host genetics and environmental factors in contributing to the development of disease. bacterial virulence factors include proteins mediating establishment/colonization, persistence of infection and finally long-term damage to the host  <cit> . the cag pathogenicity-island  is the most noteworthy among these factors. pcr analyses have suggested that this island is not intact in many strains across the world  <cit>  and the presence of an intact pai although not always  <cit>  is indicative of a more severe outcome  <cit> . the expression of various products encoded in the cag pai is known to be involved in inducing inflammation, ulceration and carcinogenesis  <cit> . however, the caga is expressed by the majority of h. pylori strains, irrespective of the geographic origin and clinical diagnosis  <cit> .

the vacuolating cytotoxin antigen  is another virulence factor that is considered to constitute an increased risk for development of peptic ulcers and gastric cancer  <cit> . allelic variations in the vaca gene are found in the signal  and the middle region  and the s <dig> type is associated with ulcer disease  <cit> .

more pronounced inflammation is associated with strains, which express the outer membrane protein oipa. oipa induces il- <dig> secretion by epithelial cells. active oipa protein production may be 'on' or 'off' depending on the number of ct repeats in the signal sequence of the oipa gene . h. pylori strains may also be grouped geographically based on oipa sequence pattern  <cit> . specific adhesins viz., baba and babb mediate the adherence of the bacterium to specific human blood group lewis antigens and are associated with various disease outcomes  <cit> . similarly, a putative e. coli restriction enzyme nlaiii homologue, the icea gene in h. pylori, which is activated on contact with the epithelium, is also shown to induce high levels of il- <dig>  <cit> .

accordingly, strains with oipa 'on' status, active forms of icea and baba  <cit>  and particularly strains which are caga+ and vaca s <dig> have been shown to cause a more severe outcome  <cit> , though not in all cases  <cit> .

many studies have pointed out a bio-geographical variation in virulence factors; for example, the sequences of vaca and caga differ in strains from the united states and europe from those in china and japan  <cit> . also, the prevalence and type of h. pylori infection varies with a very high rate of occurrence  in asia and the middle east  <cit> , in contrast to only 30–50% in europe and the united states  <cit> . further, the infection is minimal in children in the west while in the rest of the world it affects both young and the old. active infection with h. pylori was seen in about  <dig>  million people in the general population of england and wales. this although varied from one region to the other with the highest rates recorded in london  <cit> . thus h. pylori remains an important infection in the uk.

h. pylori population has been described as highly recombining, and therefore exhibits enormous strain diversity, part of it may be due to the presence of the plasticity zones  <cit> . since this organism has also been shown to be transmitted within families, a greater number of epidemiological studies reveal that these strains not only show similar genotypic profiles when obtained from related patients but also show common profiles within isolates from specific countries  <cit> . phylogeographic affinities were pronounced in case of european strains based on the multi locus sequence typing of seven housekeeping genes where the european strains and the asian strains shared an ancestral relationship  <cit> . this observation was also recorded in other studies based on the evolutionarily conserved eric sequences that indicated close associations between the irish, spanish and the european strains and also clustering of the english strains with a few asian strains  <cit> . however, the number of english strains used in that study was very small. it is noteworthy in this respect that comprehensive phylogenetic analyses in case of english strains have been rarely performed.

in this study, we aimed at a comprehensive assessment of the prevalent genetic structure of h. pylori strains infecting the english population in nottingham, which is centrally located in the united kingdom. the strains were analyzed to study a total of  <dig> different parameters pertaining to  <dig> informative loci including the virulence factors caga, oipa, icea and vaca in addition to other genes of the cag pai and the motifs downstream to it. composition of the plasticity region cluster including the putative gastritis  and gastric cancer  associated markers were also studied  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses were performed using faflp markers, nucleotide sequences of the caga, babb and the glmm genes and the repetitive sequences interspersed in the h. pylori genome . according to our observations, phylogenetic placement of english strains shows affinities with east asian and amerindian strains.

RESULTS
details of all the genotyping and phylogenetic analyses have been depicted in figures  <dig> and  <dig> and are summarized in additional file  <dig> 

macroscale analysis of the cag-pai and the downstream motifs
the status of cag a gene was assessed by using primers specific to sequences at both the 5' end and the 3' ends. pcrs for the 5' end were positive in  <dig> strains , whereas only  <dig> strains  were pcr positive for the cag 3' end. twenty-one strains  had both the ends detected by pcr indicating therefore the possible presence of a complete gene.

of the ten strains pcr negative for both caga ends, the oipa gene frame status was "on" for  <dig> of them. hence we showed no association between the presence of the caga gene and the frame status of oipa. only two strains out of the  <dig> completely pcr negative for caga did not have any motif type on the right end of the gene pcr amplified.

the most frequently detected gene by pcr in uk strains was cagt  followed by cage .

upon analysis of the extreme right junction of the cag pai ,  <dig> strains out of  <dig> had either the type iiia motif  or the type i  motif . the type iiib motif was observed in a single isolate , while  <dig> % strains displayed the type ii motif. the type iv motif was amplified in only 9% of the strains and among the three strains recovered from patients of indo – pakistani origin, n <dig> showed a type i a signature, while n <dig> showed type ii motif. the type iii motif was also observed for strains from patients of chinese  and russian  ethnicities settled in uk.

the frame status of the oipa gene was 'off' in  <dig> of the  <dig> strains that did not have successful amplification of any motif types on the right end of the cag pai and between the 3' end of the glr gene.

the sequence of the  <dig> bp product amplified from the 3' end of the caga gene was determined for  <dig> english strains. phylogenetic analyses of these sequences in comparison with others from holland , east asia , india , bangladesh , south america , south africa  and gambia )  revealed that the asian strains carried a unique caga gene sequence and formed a segregated cluster. strains from africa clustered close to the indian ones whereas english strains showed no specific clustering.

vaca and icea statuses of the isolates
 <dig>  % of the strains possessed the toxigenic type s <dig> vaca allele while the less toxigenic s <dig> allele was detected in ~ 6% strains. the vaca m <dig> genotype was present in  <dig> % strains and only  <dig>  % strains had the m1a genotype. the m1c subtype found in strains from india  <cit>  was observed in  <dig> strains and none of the strains had a type m1b vaca allele. therefore, the s1m <dig> type of vaca was most commonly  found in these english strains. only  <dig> of the  <dig> strains  with vaca s <dig> allelic subtype had the oipa gene in frame.

the icea <dig> allele was present in  <dig> strains  whereas the icea <dig> allele was found in  <dig> strains . only two strains were positive for both the alleles . the likely explanation is that these "strains" were in fact mixture of two strains.

status of the proinflammatory protein oipa gene 
strains from uk mostly had the oipa frame status 'on'  with the ct dinucleotides repeated  <dig> times in  <dig> % strains. this was followed by the repeat number of  <dig> observed in  <dig> % strains and  <dig> in  <dig> % strains.  <dig> ct repeats were found in a single isolate  and a single repeat was shown in three strains. these results and those for other loci studied are shown in the bar diagram .

inventory of the plasticity region orfs in english strains
the orf hp <dig>   <cit>  was pcr amplified in  <dig> strains , while the gastric cancer associated orf jhp <dig>  <cit> , was amplified in only  <dig> strains . other orfs from this region that were amplified included jhp <dig>  which was seen in  <dig> % strains. the orf jhp <dig> was amplified in  <dig>  % of the strains while a j <dig> specific orf jhp <dig> thought to be involved in dna replication  <cit>  was found in  <dig> % strains. orfs jhp <dig> and jhp <dig> were amplified in 13% and 40% strains respectively. none of the strains showed any specific pattern of orfs within the plasticity region.

phylogenetic placement and affinities with other genogroups
the housekeeping gene, glmm, was present in all the strains  and the adhesin babb was amplified in  <dig> strains . the babb gene has been a marker of choice for tracing lineage in h. pylori and recent studies employing this gene have postulated h. pylori 's association with its human host to be approximately  <dig>  years old  <cit> . hence phylogenies  were generated based on the sequences of these genes in representative strains. these phylogenies revealed that strains from england clustered with other european strains , while some affinities between them and peruvian strains could also be noticed. individual branches representing geographically specific glmm sequences were observed for india , japan , and africa .

faflp patterns of english strains revealed about  <dig> fragments in the size range of 50– <dig> bp when the genomic dna was digested with enzymes msei+0/ecori+a. a binary table indicating the presence or absence of a particular amplicon in each strain was scored and these values were used to assess the genetic relatedness within english  and with other european strains including those from sardinia , spain  and ireland . these strains clustered in one group labeled in the figure as the european cluster. another cluster obtained was the one which represented contribution from asian- european gene pool and included strains from india , japan , africa  and others from europe  .

a similar trend was observed with other fingerprinting techniques employing the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequences  and the repetitive extragenic palindrome  sequences. based on the amplification patterns of genomic dna between the rep sequences, the english strains grouped with the irish ones in a european cluster and a segregated cluster constituting all indian strains from ladakh and a single strain from england  was obtained . eric phylogeny for this set of strains in comparison with other strains from different world populations as reported earlier  <cit>  indicated that these strains clustered closely with either the spanish and irish strains and more distantly with the indian and african strains.

discussion
evolution of infectious microorganisms is a consequence of the genetic polymorphisms they accumulate, which in turn is the result of the long term selection pressure exerted by the host immune system in case of chronic infection as well as the environment  <cit> . this is more pronounced in case of bacteria like h. pylori that cause multi decade long infections, wherein an acquiescent requirement to constantly keep their genomic content recasting is crucial. in h. pylori this concern is resolved by the use of restriction – modification systems and regulation at gene level by nucleotide substitution, insertion and deletion events  <cit> . further, the presence of insertion elements, plasticity regions and the pathogenicity islands contribute considerably to its genetic diversity.

we attempted to analyze genetic variation and structure of h. pylori populations infecting the native people of england. the uk today is more culturally diverse than ever before with the majority of the uk population being ethnic europeans . the remaining  <dig>  million  people represent other ethnic groups. south asians are the largest of these groups, followed by caribbean and black africans  <cit> . such a multiethnic presence creates an interesting genetic conundrum when we attempt to analyze incidence and healthcare-impact of any pathogen that biases itself with respect to the host genetic makeup. also, associations of the disease outcome with the virulence factors has thus far been enigmatic and since there were no comprehensive studies involving multiple loci for genotype-phenotype assessments, the current study was envisaged in combination to generate base line data relevant in molecular epidemiology of virulent strains in england.

the cag pai is a major virulence determinant in h. pylori and strains lacking this island are akin to commensals rather than pathogens  <cit> . reports suggest that the presence of a complete set of genes within the cag pai ensures a 5-fold increased severity of disease outcome than the intermediate pai  <cit> . we have earlier showed that a higher number of strains from japan had an intact cag pai  <cit> , hence it may be thought as an important factor influencing the outcome of the infection as a higher rate of gastric cancers was observed in the japanese patients. the possible role of caga in oncogenic mechanisms is being worked upon  <cit> . most english strains in our case retained the cagt and the cage genes. studies showed that strains lacking the cagt gene had a defective 'molecular syringe' that is encoded by the pai  <cit>  reflecting thus on inability of the type iv system to eject out the caga protein. the cage gene on the other hand is known to induce nfkb activation and il <dig> secretion  <cit>  in addition to mediating host-cell cytokine rearrangements in infected epithelial cells. about  <dig> % of the strains carried the type iiia motif on the right end of the caga gene. this observation also supports the hypothesis that some of the european strains share some features typical of the asian genogroups. this is also supportive of an earlier observation  <cit>  that a very small number of strains from the european countries also show the type iii motif.

english strains mainly showed a higher number of the toxigenic s <dig> type of vaca allele. interestingly, the s1m <dig> combination was observed in less percentage in contrast to the s1m <dig> genotype that was seen in  <dig> % of the cases. earlier studies in a subset of european population  by rflp of the mid-region of the vaca gene in strains originating from dyspeptic patients demonstrated that 46% of these strains had the s1m <dig> genotype while 40% strains had the more toxigenic s1m <dig> combination  <cit> . the s1m <dig> genotype was also common in strains from north wales among clarithromycin sensitive and resistant h. pylori  <cit> . it was interesting to find the m1c allele  <cit> , which is known to be prominent in the east asians, in uk strains. none of the strains had multiple vaca genotypes, which are common in china and other east asian countries  <cit> . it has been reported earlier that the s <dig> allele was most frequently observed in the european population with the s1a allele predominant in northern and eastern europe. also, s1a and s1b alleles were observed in france and italy while the spanish and portuguese strains had the s1b subtype  <cit> .

the virulence spectrum of the english strains was also exemplified by the observation that 70% of these strains had the oipa gene in frame. greater than  <dig> ct repeats in the upstream homopolymeric tail of the oipa gene is characteristic of european strains  <cit> . our results indicate that english strains most commonly displayed  <dig> ct repeats. strains with  <dig> ct repeats were reported to have the gene out of frame owing to the deletion of the ctaa sequence present immediately upstream of the ct repeats  <cit> . similar results were found with english strains with 9ct repeats. from our analyses, the icea <dig> allele was more common than the icea <dig> allele. although no association between icea subtypes and clinical outcome has been reported, strains carrying icea <dig> produce higher levels of il- <dig> in the gastric mucosa and are more often associated with du in the north america and dutch people than strains carrying icea <dig>  <cit> . the plasticity region genes are speculated to provide the strains with survival benefits in some hosts  <cit> . this region extends from the orfs jhp <dig> to jhp <dig> in the sequenced strain j <dig> and is shown to be unstable since some genes within the zone are lost during subsequent infections or laboratory passages  <cit> . it is now evident from partial sequencing of a peruvian isolate that this plasticity region might encode yet another type iv secretion system  <cit>  and that the  <dig> sequenced genomes carry incomplete sets of genes corresponding to this cluster. all the english strains we looked at were similar to either strains  <dig> and j <dig> in that none of them harbored a complete plasticity region cluster as shown recently for a peruvian strain  <cit>  . however, any role of such a putative secretory system is still enigmatic due to lack of correlation of its intactness or abrogation with disease, although, some of the orfs in the plasticity region have been shown to be associated with a particular disease outcome  <cit> . for english strains, we analyzed seven orfs from the plasticity region cluster, of which hp <dig> was strain  <dig> specific, while others excluding hp <dig> were j <dig> specific. the orf hp <dig>  the predicted cell division protein/septum formation protein  was pcr amplified in  <dig>  % strains. jhp <dig>  a predicted dna topoisomerase i was amplified in 51%. none of the strains had the same regions of the plasticity zone deleted.

our phylogenetic analyses based on the faflp markers showed a star like distribution on an unrooted neighbor-joining network. four clusters were evident and the largest cluster was populated mainly by english isolates. further, affinity to irish and indo-european genogroups was also observed. these observations were also substantiated by other slow evolving markers such as eric and rep sequences. this denotes stable associations among the genogroups. similarly, cluster analysis of babb and glmm genes also revealed close associations within the european strains and with the indian strains. however, homologies with east asian and amerindian strains were most noteworthy and were comparable to those shown by irish strains  <cit> . this reflects ancient genetic events and possible oriental influences on the evolution of h. pylori in the english population. such kinds of non-random genetic links of h. pylori may be helpful in understanding evolution of this organism and its clinical consequences in different parts of the world. these findings are in accordance with a recent study that demonstrated that indian and european h. pylori isolates grouped in the same subpopulation and that east asian and a subset of european isolates share an ancestral relationship and diverged from each other recently  <cit> . the asian strains, however, were distinctly separated from the european and western strains based on the caga gene sequences except for a few strains that show remote similarity to the east asian gene pool. we found only a single english strain  that diverged significantly towards the asian cluster and was recovered from a patient of indo-pakistani origin and thereby denotes contribution from the asian gene pool.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our study demonstrated certain distinctive genetic features of the h. pylori gene pool in england based on genotypes of virulence genes and neutral markers. important among these features is the genetic affinity towards east asian strains. this is also probably the first comprehensive study on detailed, multilocus and multi method genotyping of h. pylori from england or elsewhere. the genomic profiles generated in this study may be useful for electronic archiving and retrieval for inter-laboratory comparison and are suitable for storage in epidemiological databases for comparative analyses. however, it will be necessary to analyze additional representative strains, especially from other european populations. also, our study has largely been an examination of a specific  group of patient isolates and may not be reflective of other patient isolates from different disease stages in england. future studies are therefore clearly needed to involve other disease specific strain groups. further characterization of associations of such informative loci as we examined, in the gene pool of diverse strain groups and with varied disease spectrum may lead to newer insights into the mechanisms of h. pylori colonization, and virulence in different hosts.
