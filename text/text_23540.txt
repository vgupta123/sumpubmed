BACKGROUND
microbial lipases  belong to the α/β-hydrolase family of enzymes  <cit>  and catalyze the hydrolysis of triglycerides to glycerol and fatty acids  <cit> . furthermore, lipases are the most frequently used biocatalysts in organic chemistry due to its ready availability and low cost production, lack of cofactors, broad substrate specificity and high enantioselectivity as well as high stability in non-aqueous media such as ionic liquids, supercritical fluids and organic solvents  <cit> . under non-aqueous reaction conditions lipases catalyze the synthesis of esters by esterification, inter-esterification, and transesterification  <cit> .

lipase catalyzed transesterifications of alcohols with esters are equilibrium reactions that need to be shifted toward the product site. therefore, several activated esters including enol- and ethoxyvinyl esters have been tested as substrates  <cit>  with enol esters such as isopropenyl acetate or vinyl acetate being the most useful acyl donors  <cit> . after cleavage, the enol tautomerizes to a carbonyl compound  which can no longer serve as a substrate for the back reaction, thus rendering the system fast and irreversible and also facilitating downstream processing due to the volatility of the carbonyl product  <cit> . furthermore, the stoichiometrically generated acetaldehyde can be used in a high-throughput assay to detect transesterification activities of lipases and esterases directly in the organic phase  <cit> . despite of these advantages, aldehydes are generally known to act as alkylating reagents by forming schiff-bases in a maillard-type reaction, in particular with enzyme lysine ε-amino groups. although schiff-base formation as such is a reversible reaction, several follow-up reactions finally render this modification irreversible  <cit> . hence, acetaldehyde affects various enzymatic properties as shown for different enzymes of biotechnological significance such as lipases, 2-deoxy-d-ribose 5-phosphate aldolase , and thiamine-diphosphate dependent enzymes, respectively  <cit> . acetaldehyde treatment of commercial lipase preparations from candida rugosa and galactomyces geotrichum  resulted in reduced activity and enantioselectivity, whereas only moderate effects were observed with lipases from pseudomonas sp. or rhizopus oryzae  <cit> . c. rugosa lipase was stabilized by immobilization, either covalently on an epoxy-activated carrier resin or by adsorption on celite  <dig>  <cit> . aldehyde-based deactivation also represents a problem in several lipase-based industrial biotransformations, e.g. in the formation of trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol and 3- glycidic acid  <cit> . only recently, the activity of c. rugosa lipase was significantly increased by immobilisation of the enzyme in crosslinked-enzyme aggregates  together with bsa as a "proteic feeder"  <cit> . further, activity has been improved by "ph-tuning" of lipases prior to their use in organic solvents, meaning that the enzyme was lyophilized from a buffer with optimal ph for biocatalysis  <cit> .

current hypotheses infer that the sensitivity of lipases toward acetaldehyde depends on:  the microbial source from which the lipase originates;  its molecular weight;  the number of lysine residues;  their solvent accessibility;  a covalent modification of lid-domain residues ; and  the pka-values of the lysine ε-amino groups  <cit> . the latter hypothesis assumed that the nucleophilicity of lysine ε-amino groups would define their contribution to the deactivation reaction and calculated pka-values were used to predict schiff-base formations with lysine ε-amino groups of higher pka-values and thus increasing acetaldehyde sensitivity of the respective lipase  <cit> . comprehensive mutagenesis studies of 2-deoxy-d-ribose 5-phosphate aldolase  <cit>  and prolipase from r. oryzae  <cit>  failed to achieve complete stabilisation against aldehyde deactivation and furthermore indicated the involvement of several different sites in these enzymes.

in this study, we demonstrate that the protonation state of lysine ε-amino groups in microbial lipases has a significant impact on their sensitivity against acetaldehyde. we also show that α,β-unsaturated polyenals derived from aldol condensation of acetaldehyde in the presence of primary amino compounds or naoh have a major impact on the deactivation process, most probably by forming stable michael-adducts with lysine and other side chains.

RESULTS
the protonation state determines the sensitivity of lipases toward acetaldehyde
schiff-base formation depends on the protonation state of primary amino groups, as only a deprotonated amino group  can nucleophilically attack the acetaldehyde carbonyl group. thus, it can be predicted that enzyme deactivation caused by schiff-base formation should depend on the ph of the respective reaction buffer. if biotransformations are performed in organic solvents with lyophilized or immobilized enzymes, their protonation state is affected by the so-called "ph-memory effect" meaning that lyophilization traps the protonation state of a protein in solution  <cit> . different commercial enzyme preparations presumably exhibit different protonation states and additionally, stabilizing additives and/or protein impurities are commonly found resulting in heterogeneities which clearly can influence the deactivation behavior of the respective biocatalyst  <cit> . therefore, we have adjusted the protonation states of lipases from candida rugosa , rhizopus oryzae , pseudomonas fluorescens , and bacillus subtilis lipases  by lyophilizing them from buffers of ph  <dig> and ph  <dig>  respectively, being far below or equal to the average pka of the lysine ε-amino groups. the freeze-dried enzymes were then treated with acetaldehyde in toluene and the residual activity was determined. we employed toluene as the solvent for our investigation because it is of significant technical importance and is frequently used in technical lipase processes  <cit> . it is worth to mention that acetaldehyde-treated lipases were not treated with reducing agents such as sodium cyanoborohydride to stabilize schiff-bases by converting them into stable secondary amines. hence, the obtained results can be attributed solely to the formation of stable acetaldehyde-protein adducts resulting from schiff-bases as precursors.

three of the studied lipases, namely crl, rol, and pfl, were previously investigated, with regard to their acetaldehyde sensitivity  <cit> . crl was deactivated strongly , rol moderately , and pfl remained nearly unaffected  upon overnight incubation with acetaldehyde  in toluene  <cit> . all enzymes tested showed a significant decrease in activity with increasing acetaldehyde concentrations after lyophilization at ph  <dig>  whereas no  or only a moderate  deactivation occurred in preparations lyophilized at ph  <dig> . these results demonstrate that even crl, which was previously classified as highly sensitive against acetaldehyde  <cit> , can be stabilized by lyophilization at a ph far below the average pka of its lysine ε-amino groups. these results support findings of majumder and gupta  <cit> , who achieved stabilization of crl. on the other hand, lipases previously described as moderately  or completely  stable against acetaldehyde  <cit>  can be rendered sensitive by lyophilization at a ph equal to the pka of their lysine ε-amino groups . the uniform deactivation behaviour of rol, crl, and pfl identifies the lipase protonation state including the ratio of nh2- to nh3+- groups as key parameters for acetaldehyde sensitivity. previous findings suggested a modification of the lid-domain covering the active site as a putative cause of deactivation in g. geotrichum and c. rugosa lipases  <cit> . thus, we compared the deactivation behaviour of bsl-a and bsl-b which share a compact minimal α/β-hydrolase fold lacking a lid  <cit> . these lipases  show the same deactivation kinetics as crl, rol, and pfl  indicating that the modification of the lipase core structure dominates the deactivation behaviour. additionally, isoelectric focusing experiments revealed a significant shift of the isoelectric point  from about ph  <dig>  for the untreated lipase sample toward ph  <dig> for the acetaldehyde treated sample . this result suggests that an initial schiff-base modification may be followed by the formation of stable acetaldehyde-protein adducts. furthermore, a prediction of the pka-values  <cit>  of solvent accessible lysine residues for all lipases whose structures are solved and deposited in the protein data base  revealed similar pka-values in all cases, including four of five lipases studied in this work . thus, it can be concluded that acetaldehyde will affect other lipases in a similar manner.

acetaldehyde induces cross-links
formaldehyde-induced modifications of model peptides and insulin demonstrated that a schiff-base modified lysine residue can form stable intra- and intermolecular cross-links with the side chains of arginine, asparagine, glutamine, histidine, tryptophan, and tyrosine  <cit> . further, intramolecular cross-links may result from the reaction of lysine-bound schiff-bases with neighbouring peptide bonds forming 4-imidazolidinone rings  <cit> . investigation of possible cross-linked products was performed using bsl-b as a model enzyme. the enzyme was incubated with different concentrations of acetaldehyde  in aqueous solution at ph  <dig> where bsl-b shows maximum activity and stability  <cit> . analysis by sds-page revealed additional bands with higher molecular weight  appearing at an acetaldehyde concentration of  <dig>  m . the intensity of these bands increased with increasing acetaldehyde concentrations indicating the formation of bslb-dimers  and trimers  respectively, presumably caused by intermolecular cross-link formation. parallel determination of the hydrolytic lipase activity and the soluble protein concentration revealed deactivation already at an acetaldehyde concentration of  <dig>  m . increasing the acetaldehyde concentration to  <dig>  m led to a complete deactivation of bsl-b, whereas considerable protein aggregation could be detected only at concentrations above  <dig>  m . furthermore, a shift toward higher molecular weight was observed for the monomeric form of bsl-b  which might be explained by a shift of the isoelectric point  due to acetaldehyde-induced modifications. alves et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the electrophoretic mobility of a highly acidic protein could be increased by modifying acidic amino acid residues, resulting in an increased pi. this change of the pi increases the ability of the protein to bind sds  <cit> . for bsl-b, acetaldehyde induced modification results in a decrease of the pi , which in turn probably decreases its ability to bind sds and thus, explains the observed mobility shift   <cit> . intramolecular cross-links, which most probably also occur, will potentially not give rise to a defined shift of the electrophoretic mobility, because there a several modification sites present on the protein surface, which prevents the formation of specific crossed-linked products. separate substitution of each lysine residue in bsl-b against arginine and alanine, respectively, did not result in decreased lipase activity . thus, acetaldehyde-induced deactivation is not the consequence of modification of a single "hot-spot" lysine residue as previously suggested for g. geotrichum and c. rugosa lipases  <cit> .

acetaldehyde sensitivity of bsl-b depends on enzyme concentration
bsl-b samples  were incubated for  <dig> h in the presence of  <dig> mm acetaldehyde resulting in a molar excess of at least  <dig> acetaldehyde molecules per bsl-b molecule. at higher lipase concentrations no  or only moderate deactivation  was observed whereas at lower concentrations  the residual specific lipase activity linearly decreased with decreasing enzyme concentrations .

the deactivation behaviour of bsl-b may be explained by spontaneous aggregate formation, a phenomenon that has already been described for lipases of c. rugosa  <cit> , p. fluorescens  <cit> , p. aeruginosa  <cit> , staphylococcus aureus  <cit> , and bsl-a  <cit> , which is 74% identical to bsl-b  <cit> .

the formation of active and soluble bsl-b aggregates was analyzed by dynamic light scattering over a time range of  <dig> h . aggregate formation could be detected only at bsl-b concentrations exceeding  <dig>  mg/ml. these results indicate that concentration dependent formation of higher molecular lipase aggregates lead to a decelerated deactivation process, probably due to a decreased accessibility of modifiable amino acid side chains within the aggregates.

acetaldehyde forms α,β-unsaturated polyenals which modify bsl-b
incubation of bsl-b with acetaldehyde in aqueous or non-aqueous solvents  resulted in the formation of a yellow to brownish colour . the influence of different buffer components on colour formation was analyzed by incubating  <dig> mm acetaldehyde dissolved in water in the presence of glycine, naoh and glycine/naoh, respectively. in all cases, the incubation of acetaldehyde with glycine and/or naoh led to a yellow to reddish-brown coloured solution . the influence of a protein on colour formation was tested with a highly purified preparation of bovine serum albumin . upon addition of acetaldehyde, the initially yellow-orange colour shifted to red-brown and finally to black after further addition of glycine and/or naoh . after precipitation with tca, the protein pellets also were coloured orange to brown . thus, we concluded that  in the presence of a base  and/or a primary amino compounds  acetaldehyde forms coloured compounds;  colour formation is intensified by combining a base with primary amino compounds; and  the coloured compounds can bind to a protein.

in order to further analyze the coloured reaction products formed in an aqueous solution containing  <dig> mm acetaldehyde and  <dig> mm glycine/naoh-buffer or  <dig> mm naoh, respectively, they were extracted from the aqueous solution and subjected to gc/ms analysis, which clearly revealed the presence of α,β-unsaturated polyenals in aqueous acetaldehyde/naoh-samples with  <dig> -hexadienal  and  <dig> ,6-octatrienal  being the most prominent compounds in the yellow coloured acetaldehyde/naoh sample . our results are supported by earlier findings reported in the literature, which also demonstrated the formation of α,β-unsaturated polyenals from acetaldehyde in the presence of bases and primary amino compounds in aqueous solution  <cit> . specifically,  <dig> mm glycine in an aqueous  <dig> mm acetaldehyde solution was shown to catalyze the formation  <dig> -hexadienal,  <dig> ,6-octatrienal,  <dig> , <dig> -decatetraenal, and longer chained polyenals, which leads to a reddish-brown to black colour  <cit> . hence, we assume that the colour formation we have observed is caused by the formation of α,β-unsaturated polyenals and the colour differences result from the different sizes of the respective conjugated π-electron systems formed.

α,β-unsaturated polyenals bind to bsl-b by michael addition
in comparison to acetaldehyde, α,β-unsaturated polyenals cannot only induce the formation of unstable schiff-bases with primary amino groups, but are also capable of forming stable michael-adducts by reaction of their double bond in α,β-position with the nucleophilic side chains of arginine, histidine, lysine and serine  <cit> . we analyzed differently composed samples , bsl-b , glycine , naoh , and acetaldehyde  in different combinations) to detect protein-bound carbonyl groups which are formed only by michael-addition of α,β-unsaturated polyenals. the  <dig> -dinitrophenylhydrazine -assay revealed the formation of protein-carbonyl compounds only in the presence of naoh and/or primary amino compounds . in the presence of glycine, a three- to five-fold higher number of carbonyl groups was detected indicating a high catalytic efficiency of glycine as aldol condensation catalyst. the lower values determined for bsl-b as compared to bsa can be attributed to a lower number of modifiable amino acid residues . a more precise localization of the modification sites was attempted by analysis of acetaldehyde-treated bsl-b with maldi-tof-ms. ms-spectra showed considerable heterogeneity and sufficient material for analyses was difficult to obtain due to the modification of predominantly lysine residues which hampered trypsin digestion during sample preparation. nevertheless, we succeeded to identify a modified peptide fragment with mw =  <dig>  dalton consisting of amino acids asn26-lys <dig>  michael-addition of crotonaldehyde to the native asn26-lys <dig> fragment  would result in a theoretical molecular mass shift of  <dig>  da to give  <dig>  da. this result is the first indication that α,β-unsaturated polyenals can interact with bsl-b and form stable michael-adducts with surface exposed amino acid residues. further indications were obtained by studying the direct inactivation of bsl-b with  <dig> -hexadienal , which was among the major α,β-unsaturated polyenals identified in our samples.

 <dig> -hexadienal inactivates bsl-b not only by modification of lysine residues
in order to investigate the direct effect of α,β-unsaturated polyenals, we tested the ability of  <dig> -hexadienal to inactivate bsl-b at concentrations of  <dig> mm,  <dig> mm,  <dig> mm, and  <dig> mm. as expected, bsl-b activity decreased with increasing  <dig> -hexadienal concentrations. it is interesting to note that incubation of bsl-b with  <dig> mm  <dig> -hexadienal reduced the hydrolytic activity to 19% after  <dig> h whereas no activity decrease was detected after incubation with the same concentration of acetaldehyde .

to identify the influence of primary amino groups  on the acetaldehyde induced deactivation, we analyzed differently treated bsl-b samples by sds-page and ief, determined their residual hydrolytic activity, and also documented the colour after incubation with  <dig> mm acetaldehyde . comprehensive modification of primary amino groups with methylacetimidate  abolished the formation of intermolecular cross-links and also a decrease of the pi . these results clearly indicate that both reactions are caused by schiff-base modified lysine side chains. subsequently, methylacetimidate was removed and acetaldehyde  and fresh glycine/naoh-buffer was added . the addition of fresh glycine/naoh buffer introduced unmodified glycine into the sample and its free amino groups can initiate the formation of α,β-unsaturated polyenals, which was additionally proven by the formation of coloured compounds in samples  <dig> und  <dig> . determination of the hydrolytic activity of samples  <dig> and  <dig> demonstrated that the activity of sample  <dig>  which contained α,β-unsaturated polyenals, decreased by ~ 40% relative to sample  <dig> . as all solvent accessible amino groups in bsl-b were modified by methylacetimidate, this effect can only be explained by modification of amino acid side chains other than those of lysine  with α,β-unsaturated polyenals, as has earlier been demonstrated  <cit> . in summary, about 40% of the acetaldehyde induced deactivation of bsl-b can be traced back to michael-adduct formation at arginine, histidine, and serine side chains  and about 60% to the michael-addition of α,β-unsaturated polyenals to lysine ε-amino groups.

CONCLUSIONS
lipase-catalyzed transesterification reactions of vinyl esters result in the formation of acetaldehyde which is known to deactivate microbial lipases. until now, deactivation was thought to be caused by structural changes resulting from initial schiff-base formation at solvent accessible lysine residues of the enzymes  <cit> . using bsl-b as a model enzyme we demonstrate that acetaldehyde induced modifications lead to an increase of the enzymes' molecular mass presumably caused by intermolecular cross-linking and a decrease of the isoelectric point, respectively. these stable modifications of the enzyme can be explained by michael-addition of α,β-unsaturated polyenals, formed by aldol condensation of acetaldehyde in the presence of bases and/or amino acids  <cit> . moreover, we found indications that these polyenals act as non-competitive inhibitors of the enzyme.

our results further demonstrated that acetaldehyde-induced inactivation of microbial lipases can be avoided by adjusting the protonation state of the enzymes. thus, "ph-tuning" of lipases cannot only preserve activity but also stability of the enzymes by effectively shielding surface exposed amino groups through protonation. this pre-treatment can avoid the formation of α,β-unsaturated polyenals  and protonates primary amino groups which are, besides other nucleophilic side chains, most accessible to michael-addition. as ph-changes may affect the activity and stability of the enzymes, a prerequisite of ph-tuning is sufficient stability and activity at weak acidic to neutral ph. besides, free amino acids such as glycine, which is frequently used as a buffer component for lipase preparations, should be avoided for lipase preparations used in transesterification reactions with vinyl esters as they amplify the inactivation process.

our findings also explain the higher stability of several immobilized lipase preparations which is caused by the minimization of solvent-accessible amino groups and other nucleophilic groups. in summary, our results allow us to propose a refined mechanism for acetaldehyde-induced deactivation of microbial lipases as summarized in figure  <dig>
