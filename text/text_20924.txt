BACKGROUND
one characteristic of many proteins is the presence of tandem repeats in their sequence. it has been estimated that approximately 14% of all known proteins contain significant internal repeats, most of them in eukaryotic organisms
 <cit> .

different categories of tandem repeats can be defined
 <cit> .  repeats of short oligopeptides  that are unlikely to form structural or functional units by themselves and become a single functional entity when interactions among repeats take place.  repeats that range in length from  <dig> to  <dig> residues, which form structurally independent units but may not function independently
 <cit> . within this group there are proteins with a well-established three-dimensional structure that are often involved in mediating protein-protein interactions.  longer repeats in the order of  <dig> amino acids that constitute structurally and functionally independent units
 <cit> .

structural cell wall proteins as well as arabinogalactan proteins  are included in the first category described above. there are three main classes of structural proteins in plant cell walls; the division is based on their amino acid composition and their repeating sequences: hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins or extensins , proline-rich proteins , and glycine-rich proteins 
 <cit> . hrgps contain ser-hyp <dig> pentapeptide repeats, which are glycosylated by galactose and arabinose side chains
 <cit>  and whose role is to strengthen the cell wall
 <cit> . prps have been classified in five classes
 <cit>  on the basis of their motifs, domains and biochemical characteristics, and they were first identified as proteins that accumulate in the cell wall in response to physical damage
 <cit> . they have also been implicated in cell wall integrity
 <cit>  and in plant defence
 <cit> . grps are characterized by a high content  and repetitive sequences of glycine residues based on n motifs. cell wall grps are often associated with the vascular system of plants, and their synthesis appears to be regulated during development
 <cit> .

agps are proteoglycans whose carbohydrate part accounts for more than 90% of the molecule on a weight basis
 <cit> . in many agps the protein core contains relatively high amounts of hydroxyproline, serine, threonine and alanine
 <cit> . agps have been classified as classical agps, which contain a glycosylphophatidylinositol  anchor signal sequence for plasma membrane attachment
 <cit> ; non-classical agps, which do not contain a gpi signal, ag-peptides of 10- to  <dig> amino acid residues, and fasciclin-like agps. agps have been implicated in various plant growth and developmental processes , such as somatic embryogenesis, pollen tube growth, cell proliferation, cell expansion, and cell differentiation.

the second category of tandem repeat proteins, those with repeats of between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, are classified attending to the consensus sequence of the repeat. some well characterized repeats are ankyrin
 <cit> , heat
 <cit> , a leucine-rich repeat 
 <cit> , armadillo
 <cit> , kelch
 <cit> , wd-40
 <cit> , tetratricopeptide repeat 
 <cit> , pentatricopeptide repeat 
 <cit> , α-coiled coil heptad repeats
 <cit>  and an eicosapentapeptide repeat 
 <cit> . most of these repeats have a significant preference for binding proteins and other ligands; this capacity is determined by the tertiary structure. thus, wd- <dig> and kelch repeats fold in ß-propellers
 <cit> . these structures have a binding “supersite” along the propeller axis with a preference for small ligands. instead tprs form a right-handed super-helix with a groove of large surface area available for ligand binding and they do not appear to possess a single supersite. heat proteins form antiparallel α helices stacked in a consecutive array resembling a hook
 <cit> , and lrrs adopt a curved shape with α helices and ß strands and their repeats also participate in protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions . nevertheless, many tandem repeats seem to exhibit only a slight tendency to form a single, well-defined structure. most cannot be crystallized; if the parent protein is crystallized, the tandem repeat region has weak electron density and appears disordered. many repeats are, or consist of, intrinsically unstructured proteins 
 <cit> ; in turn many iup’s consist of tandem repeats. however, there are many exceptions both ways.

tandem repeats confer important structural features and special functions to these proteins but they usually occur in association with other domains with specific biological roles, and consequently proteins in the same family may perform dissimilar functions. as an a example, in plants many proteins with different roles have lrr domains, such as transport inhibitor response  <dig> , the auxin receptor involved in the auxin signalling pathway
 <cit> ; the protein encoded by tomato cf9
 <cit> , which is an r protein and participates in plant disease resistance, and clavata  <dig>  a ser/thr kinase receptor, necessary for the maintenance of the shoot apical meristem
 <cit> .

the aim of the present work was to analyze shoot specific  proteins, a class of proteins with tandem repeats from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. st mrnas were first found in leguminosae
 <cit> , but at that time no similar transcripts had been found in other species. nevertheless, the present increase in genome sequencing projects and expressed sequence tags  databases in recent years has allowed the search for new similar st dna and/or st protein sequences. we analyzed the presence of the st gene/protein family in living organisms with a view to finding clues about the structure and role of such proteins. we also studied their possible similarities to other proteins of tandem repeats including cell wall proteins in order to determine whether they belong to any of these groups.

the first st cdna  was found in pisum sativum <cit> . it was described as shoot-/stem-specific, having as its main characteristics  <dig> tandem repeats of  <dig> amino acids and a putative signal peptide, as well as several putative n-glycosylation sites. in  <dig>  using c <dig> as a probe williams et al.
 <cit>  found  <dig> genes in the pea genome, one of them highly expressed in stem  and the other one expressed in pea pod tissues, but not in stem . those authors also pointed out the existence of a third related gene. the proteins encoded by these genes were described as organ-specific and differed in the number of repeats.

later, two st-related clones of cicer arietinum canst <dig> and canst <dig> , from a 5-day old epicotyl cdna library were isolated after a differential screening to select clones whose expression increases with epicotyl growth
 <cit> . the possible existence of at least one more gene in chickpea was also noted. the chickpea carst <dig> deduced protein presents the highest homology with pea sequences except that it has  <dig> repeats. carst <dig> is slightly different, mainly because there are  <dig> amino acids in each of its  <dig> tandem repeat sequences and no putative n-glycosylation sites are present
 <cit> . as in peas, chickpea sts are also organ-specific, and transcript accumulation is limited to organs that perform elongation in a way not related to auxin or to brassinolides
 <cit> , and appear just when the epicotyl starts to elongate after germination
 <cit> . the role of these proteins in plant development remains unknown, although a putative role in cell elongation has been suggested
 <cit> .

RESULTS
sts are specific to several plant families and form a multigenic family
all st sequences found in the different searches conducted in this work belonged to dicot plants  and no similar sequences were found in kingdoms other than the plant kingdom. according to ncbi taxonomic classification, the phylogenetic distribution of all species having st proteins as well as a few representative species without st proteins  showed that no st genes were found in green algae , moss  and lycophyte  genomes. also no st-encoding sequences or st proteins were found in gymnosperms or monocots . since several monocot genomes, such as rice or maize, are now fully sequenced it may be concluded that this kind of protein is not present in these plants.

taking into account genes, ests, and protein searches, sequences encoding proteins similar to st  were found in  <dig> plant genera and  <dig> species  belonging to magnoliophyta  mainly in asteridae  and rosidae . two taxonomic families, the fabaceae family  and the asteraceae family , grouped 43% of the genera found. it is worth noting that no sequences encoding st proteins were found in dicot species such as the brassicales arabidopsis thaliana and carica papaya, among others, and linum usitatissimum whose genomes have been fully sequenced. nonetheless, it is possible that more species, both with and without st genes, could appear as the genome sequencing projects progressed. up to date the plant species that do not appear in the phylogenetic tree  are not known to encode st proteins.

after the usda plants databases taxonomic classification , all species are included in five subclasses among the  <dig> described in the class magnoliopsida: asteridae , rosidae , dilleniidae , hamamelididae  and magnoliidae .

among the  <dig> genomes found on the phytozome v <dig>  web page  there are st genes in only  <dig> plant species : manihot esculenta, ricinus communis, populus trichocarpa, medicago truncatula, glycine max, cucumis sativus, prunus persica, eucalyptus grandis, vitis vinifera, mimulus guttatus and aquilegia caerulea. although searches to find st genes retrieve many low-similarity sequences in most genomes, several matches do not have an associated orf or the peptides do not show st characteristics, as described below.

genes that did not encode a canonical st as determined by studying the protein sequences are indicated by *. some of the genes were also found in embl genebank, as can be seen in additional file
 <dig>  numbers indicate the order in which the sequences were found.

among type-ii tandem repeat proteins
 <cit> , proteins with epr repeats have also only been described in angiosperms
 <cit> , although unlike sts they have also been found in  <dig> monocot species such as rice, and in  <dig> dicots such as arabidopsis, indicating a further specialization of st proteins.

in light of these data, it seems clear that st proteins are limited to several taxonomic families, which indicates that their function could be related to differential characteristics of the families in which they are present. however, the fact that they are not ubiquitous proteins in the plant kingdom does not indicate a minor role in plant development.

as initially reported for pea
 <cit>  and chickpea
 <cit> , analyses of the genomes of plant species having st indicated that they have at least two st genes , except for a. caerulea and m. guttatus. the largest family was found in m. truncatula, with six members, followed by v. vinifera, with  <dig> genes, and m. esculenta with  <dig> . analysis of est fragments also pointed to the existence of a family of st genes in several species. five different est-encoding st proteins were found in p. sativum and  <dig> in helianthus ciliaris, as summarized in additional file
 <dig>  furthermore, it is possible that not all the members of each species have yet been isolated.

most genes studied , or at least canonical st genes, have one intron starting  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides from the initial methionine codon, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides in length . the presence of such an intron makes it difficult the characterization of full-length open reading frames  in genome analyses, owing to the occurrence of several methionine-encoding codons downstream from the intron. thus, in c. sativus st <dig> and st <dig> , p. persica st <dig>  and m. esculenta st <dig>  genes no intron has been defined, and in r. communis st <dig> , v. vinifera st <dig>  and a. caerulea st <dig>  the intron starts at nucleotides  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. finally in vvist <dig>  messt <dig> and e. grandis st <dig>  two introns were determined. the full-length orf in st genes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> nucleotides . finally, full-length est sequences clearly establish the presence of the intron upon comparing genomic and cdna sequences.

st proteins present a signal peptide, a duf <dig> domain and tandem repeat oligopeptides and could be grouped in three main types
after the search performed here, we studied a large number of deduced st proteins in order to look for common features. since no purified st protein has ever been isolated, our data come from the gene or cdna deduced proteins and some characteristics remain to be confirmed empirically.

since most cdna deduced proteins came from studies of massive est characterization, an analysis of the proteins was performed in order to determine whether each est fragment encoded a full-length protein and the number of different st proteins in each species. to date,  <dig> different st proteins have been found . analysis of these proteins revealed that  <dig> were full-length proteins;  <dig> had at least the n-terminal sequence; in  <dig> it seemed that the c-terminal end was complete, and finally  <dig> sequences represented only internal fragments of the protein.

st proteins vary in size. after the analysis of  <dig> st full-length sequences, a variation between  <dig>  and  <dig>  amino acids in length was found, and hence the predicted molecular mass varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda, in most cases being a characteristic of the plant species in question. thus, the v. vinifera family ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids and the m. truncatula family from  <dig> to  <dig>  thirty-six percent of the st sequences had fewer than  <dig> amino acids; 41% ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  and 23% had more than  <dig> amino acids. this latter group included the members of the barrel medic st family,  <dig> st proteins of the fabaceae family, including chickpea,  <dig> sequences of asteraceae belonging to the genus helianthus as well as jcust <dig>  messt <dig> and stust <dig>  the predominance of smaller st proteins could have been due to the way in which the sequences were found; analysis of est fragments usually gives the smallest one in higher proportions. thus, analysis of the sequences that were not full-length showed that 62% had more than  <dig> amino acids, of which 56% had more than  <dig> amino acids.

as stated in the background section, previously described deduced st proteins
 <cit>  are characterized by the presence of a signal peptide, a mature n-terminal end before repeats, and tandem repeats of 25/ <dig> amino acids . according to katti et al.
 <cit> , st proteins belong to category ii of proteins having repeats in tandem; that is, those with the repeats ranging in length from  <dig> to  <dig> residues. thus, several st protein characteristics will be discussed in comparison with previously described proteins of that group.

all st mature proteins are highly hydrophilic, except saest <dig>  which is hydrophobic at its c-terminal. because it was the only exception, we consider that there was probably a sequencing mistake at the end of the coding sequence.

the charged amino acids  varied from  <dig> to 49%, 87% of the sequences ranging from  <dig> to 45%, and the percentage of acidic amino acids usually being higher than basic ones.

st proteins display several patterns with high occurrence as n-glycosilation, several different phosphorylation, n-myristoylation and amidation sites. furthermore, ccast <dig> and messt <dig> showed a cell attachment consensus sequence, gmast <dig> and vunst <dig> a lys-rich consensus pattern, and tvest <dig> a peptidase pattern as analyzed by the scanprosite tool.

there is a sequence, ctest <dig>  which did not fulfil the general pattern, although it exhibited a similar structure and hence will be considered as st-like and no properly as st.

st proteins enter the secretory pathway owing to the presence of a signal peptide
the subcellular location of a protein is an important goal in determining its function. analysis of the  <dig> sequences having the n-terminal ends with the signalp  <dig>  server
 <cit>  revealed that all deduced st proteins had a signal peptide , which indicates that these proteins enter the secretory pathway. fifty-five of the sequences analyzed had the predicted cleavage site between positions  <dig> and  <dig> as determined using the signalp  <dig>  logarithm
 <cit> , cleavage sites 23/ <dig>  and 21/ <dig>  being well represented. the signal peptide ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids in length. it should be noted that 72% of the sequences had a score above  <dig>  
 <cit> , the highest being  <dig>   and the lowest  <dig>  , probably due to an incorrect deduced intron splicing. once the cleavage site had been determined, we observed that the mature protein started with an arg in all  <dig> sequences except in 2: bpest <dig> and mtrst <dig> 

the presence of that clear signal peptide in each sequence analyzed indicates that they enter the secretory pathway and could be targeted extracellularly, although the final destination must be studied further. thus, a bioinformatic analysis of protein targeting was carried out with  <dig> full-length st proteins on three servers: wolf psort
 <cit> , psort
 <cit>  and the targetp  <dig>  server
 <cit> .

as expected, targetp  <dig>  clearly revealed that the proteins enter the secretory pathway  but not chloroplasts, vacuoles or other locations, whose scores never reached  <dig> , usually being lower than  <dig> . the analysis of sequences by psort was more complex because the scores for vacuole were slightly higher than for outside the cell in 65% of the sequences  and in 26% the score for the outside prediction was higher . in two sequences  we obtained a high score for the outside localization and no score for the vacuole; in another two sequences the score was much higher for the vacuole and, finally, two more sequences  gave a predicted location in the er membrane, with a score of  <dig>  and no targeting either to the vacuole or outside the cell. in all cases, low scores of around  <dig>  were found for several other locations such as the lumen of the er, the er membrane, peroxisome, the mitochondrial outer membrane, the golgi apparatus, the plasma membrane, and the nucleus. finally, according to the wolf psort prediction, 46% of st proteins were clearly targeted to the extracellular compartment; 13% were not targeted to the outside, and 23% were targeted mainly to compartments other than the cell wall, such as the vacuole, chloroplast, er and even the nucleus. the location of the remaining st proteins could not be established since several locations had the same scores. it is noteworthy that in some cases the triple analysis gave different results for the same protein. also, a multiple location of a given st cannot be excluded.

members of the st family in a given plant species have different locations, which indicates different putative roles in plant physiology. for instance, the targeting prediction for the six sts of barrel medic was to chloroplasts for mtrst <dig>  er for mtrst <dig> and  <dig>  extracellular for mtrst <dig> and  <dig>  and extracellular, vacuole and er locations with the same score for mtrst <dig> 

a unique location is not a common characteristic for proteins bearing tandem repeats. in proteins with  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid repeats, locations in nucleosomes 
 <cit> , chloroplasts 
 <cit>  and mitochondria 
 <cit> , among others, have been suggested.

from our data it is clear that st proteins enter the secretory pathway and that several proteins will end up in the cell wall, although individual proteins could have different final targets, such as the vacuole. it should be noted that since the predicted isoelectric point  of st proteins is clearly acidic , 71% ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , if they were located in the cell wall  the ionic interactions would be very weak and unless they interacted by covalent bonds no strong binding to the cell wall would be expected.

the mature n-terminal end has conserved characteristics
the n-terminal end before the repeats of st proteins is defined as the area that extends from the end of the signal peptide to the start of the tandem repeat region. its length varied considerably, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, except for hcist <dig>  and afpst <dig> , the most frequent being from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids  . this region starts with an arg, which is the first amino acid of the mature protein, as previously indicated, followed in most cases by lys . six amino acids  away from the first arg, tyr-trp were found in highly conserved positions seven and eight in 83% of the sequences analyzed, this trp being the only one in the mature protein, except in  <dig> sequences . in this region the only cys of the mature sequence appeared. 16% of st sequences lacked such cys, and no other cys was found in any part of the mature protein. exceptions were found in cmost <dig>  mtrst <dig> and qrost <dig>  where a cys appeared instead of a conserved tyr in the tandem repeats. this exception could be explained in terms of a putative mistake in sequencing because only one base differed between the cys codon and the tyr codon. only mtrst <dig> lacked tyr, trp and cys. no conserved distances were found between tyr-trp and cys  and  <dig> to  <dig> ) or between cys and the start of the first repeat oligopeptide ). it seems that these distances, strongly associated with phylogenetic closeness, are not very important in the role of st proteins.

mature st proteins have tandem repeat oligopeptides that share a hexapeptide followed by  <dig> partially conserved amino acids and a fully conserved tyrosine at position 11
the second region  in the mature protein is the tandem repeat oligopeptide area . this region may start with  <dig> or  <dig> imperfect repeats that sometimes have different lengths or lack the characteristic of the canonical repeats. finally, this region usually ends with a truncated repeat of  <dig> amino acids.

the repeats start with a common hexapeptide feprp , variable in the first amino acid, which may be glu or asp. four amino acids, designated x <dig>  and a fully conserved tyr follow the hexapeptide
 <cit> . thus, after translation the sequences with at least one sequence similar to feprpx4y were considered st proteins. furthermore, each time this sequence was found, we decided that a new repeat had started, including the last truncated one.

analysis of the putative  <dig> st full-length sequences revealed considerable variability in the number of repeats, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . in fact, those having only two repeats had a canonical repeat and a truncated one, giving the smallest st proteins, with fewer than  <dig> amino acids. thus, the number of repeats would be responsible for the different sizes of st proteins. this variability has also been found in other  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid tandem repeat proteins, such as tpr proteins
 <cit>  and epr proteins
 <cit> , indicating that along evolution the loss and gain of these units has occurred frequently
 <cit> . the origin of tandem peptide repeats can be attributed to intragenic duplication and recombination
 <cit> , which could explain the differences in number but also the similarity in the repeats within a protein and within a genus and family, as discussed below.

the length of the repeats also varied, ranging from  <dig> amino acids  to  <dig> amino acids . the repeats having  <dig> ,  <dig>  or alternating repeats of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids  were clearly predominant . in fact, 89% of the sequences analyzed had repeats ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. most of the st proteins  had each regular repeat of the same size ; 13% had alternating repeats of different size, and in three of them  each repeat was of a different size.

to detect common characteristics within the repeats, a comparison was made using only two repeats of each protein  represented with the weblogo application
 <cit> . it was clear that the consensus sequence of  <dig> analyzed proteins  , provided the same result observed previously; that is dfeprpx4y. however, sometimes certain differences were observed in a given species, most frequently the substitution of asp by glu in the hexamer. each repeat had one tyr at position  <dig>  except for a few sequences that had two tyr in each repeat  separated by  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, while others had  <dig> or  <dig>  depending on the repeat . in several tandem repeat proteins, such as tpr and ppr, a conserved tyr is involved in maintaining the tertiary structure of these proteins  by hydrophobic interactions
 <cit> . in structural cell wall proteins, tyr is able to form isodityrosine links, both inter- and intra-molecular, making a structural protein net
 <cit> . conserved tyr could play a similar role in st proteins.

the x <dig> in the consensus sequence could determine a putative n-glycosylation signal , as we will discuss later on.

the establishment of a consensus pattern in the repeat from tyr at position  <dig> is difficult due to the different lengths of the repeats. therefore, only  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid repeats were used in that analysis. thus, the general consensus sequence for each repeat was dfeprpx4yx6-7kxkkxfxk , which shows a less conserved lys at position  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  or  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . apart from the x <dig> positions, amino acids x6- <dig> in the consensus pattern are phylogenetically conserved, being rich in asp and asn.

the existence of highly conserved patterns in the repeats is infrequent among tandem repeat oligopeptide proteins, most of them having degenerated repeats with occasional conserved amino acids at fixed positions, probably involved in the three-dimensional structure
 <cit> . there is one exception: epr proteins
 <cit>  with a repeat of  <dig> amino acids and a x2cx4cx10cx2hggg consensus sequence, which is clearly different from the st proteins consensus sequence. the presence of perfect, or nearly perfect, tandem repeats could indicate the structural and functional importance of each residue or recent evolutionary events
 <cit> . the degree of perfection of tandem repeats can be determined by means of a parameter, called psim, that can be calculated with the t-reks program
 <cit> . psim values equal to or higher than  <dig>  indicates that the proteins have perfect  or nearly perfect tandem repeats
 <cit> . analysis of the  <dig> st full-length proteins by t-reks indicated that 72% had a psim value higher than  <dig> , 33% being higher than  <dig>  and 1%  higher than  <dig> . jorda et al.
 <cit>  found that the level of repeat perfection was correlated with their tendency to be unstructured.

although to date no studies on st tertiary structure have been performed, the presence of many conserved tandem repeats seems to point to a slight tendency to form a single, well-defined structure. by contrast, others defined proteins with tandem repeats of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids are proteins with a well-established three-dimensional structure, often involved in mediating protein-protein interactions, as indicated in the background section.

st proteins are characterized by a duf <dig> domain
most of the st deduced proteins studied,  <dig> out of  <dig>  have one or several complete and/or partial domains of unknown function, duf2775
 <cit> , pfam family 10950
 <cit> , that do not extend to the signal peptide present in those proteins, as will be discussed below. duf <dig> was defined in the basis of  <dig> st sequences acting as a core . the multiple sequence alignment shows a highly conserved motif of  <dig> amino acids. this motif comprises approximately  <dig> amino acids from the non-repeating area of the peptide,  <dig> tandem repeats and  <dig> truncated tandem repeat. duf <dig> appeared in all proteins, even though they were not full-length ones. rhist <dig> and fanst <dig> sequences, from two genera of the rosaceae family were the only exceptions, with a slightly different structure, although it is not clear whether there might be a phase shift in the translated sequence. this duf <dig> domain is a specific characteristic of st proteins and it has not been described in other type-ii tandem repeat proteins
 <cit> . all st proteins have at least one duf <dig> domain and they may also have other truncated duf <dig> domains ranging in number. as duf <dig> contain  <dig> tandem repeats, they can be overlapped in the same protein.

according to blast, 47% of the full-length sequences had only one duf <dig> domain while 30% had one complete domain and one or several  truncated duf <dig> domains. the highest number of complete duf <dig> domains in one sequence was  <dig>  found in mtrst <dig>  bpest <dig> and carst <dig>  this latter also having a truncated domain. several sequences had overlapping duf <dig> domains, such as saest <dig>  tprst <dig>  ljast <dig>  amast <dig> and aglst <dig>  and others had only truncated duf <dig> domains , as in harst <dig>  hcust <dig>  hcist <dig> and tofst <dig> 

three main types of st proteins can be defined according to their putative glycosylation pattern
as stated above, the x <dig> in the consensus sequence repeats was conserved among phylogenetically close species. the analysis of x <dig> in all  <dig> sequences  showed that 84%  predominantly had one kind of consensus pattern, while 16% had a mixture of different patterns, the mixture of nxsx and dxt/sx  being predominant.

the x <dig> sequence determines the presence or absence of one n-glycosylation site per repeat and could indicate different types in the st protein family. thus, the x <dig> pattern could be used to identify three main st types :

type i. this type represents 21% of st proteins and are characterized by sequences with ser at position  <dig> in most repeats . these repeats do not have any n-glycosylation site between the hexapeptide and the tyr at position  <dig>  in each species, only one type i st was found, and this sequence was designated st <dig> in each species. sequences with an x <dig> pattern other than sxtx were designated st <dig> , even when only one sequence was found in the species in question.

type ii. characterized by sequences with asn at position  <dig> in most repeats. this type includes two subtypes: iia, where the x <dig> sequence is nxsx  with an n-glycosylation site in all or almost all repeats, and iib, where x <dig> is nxx , without an n-glycosylation pattern. subtype iia was the most abundant  and several members of this subtype could be found within one species, such as psast <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in p. sativum, or mtrst <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in m. truncatula. only three st proteins, representing 2% of the sts, belonged to subtype iib: mtrst <dig>  tprst <dig> and ppest <dig>  whether the type iia sequences might be subject to a true n-glycosylation and the role of such post-translation modifications in the function of the protein remain to be determined empirically.

type iii. characterized by sequences having asp or thr at position  <dig> in most repeats. this type represents 13% of st sequences, x <dig> being often dxt/sx. as in type i and iib, these repeats do not have any n-glycosylation site between the hexapeptide and tyr at position  <dig> 

there are also st proteins with a mixture of x <dig> patterns in the different repeats that usually cluster in one of these types, depending on the predominant pattern.

the differences between the more abundant protein types, i and iia, can be visualized by two sample logo
 <cit>  . it was observed that the main difference was the x <dig> sequence in both,  <dig>  and  <dig>  amino acids repeat comparison. also, in some type i st a second tyr can be found. the repeats of  <dig> amino acids showed higher variations , probably due to the higher sequence number analyzed. a preference for asp in type iia at several positions, including the first amino acid in the hexamer could be noted . in contrast some positions are fully conserved in type i and iia sts, pro in position  <dig> and tyr in position  <dig> . furthermore  <dig> amino acid comparison showed an extra fully conserved pro at position  <dig> .

to check whether these different types could indeed group sequences with common characteristics, a phylogenetic tree was generated using the  <dig> mature full-length sequences . it was observed that the sequences claded according to taxonomic subclass, and even families, which indicates that several characteristics  are related to the taxonomic group. st proteins from the fabaceae family split into two groups, and a clear separation among the above types was observed. however, it is clear that not only the x <dig> pattern contributed to the grouping of the proteins, since the taxonomic characteristics in the less conserved part of the repeat were also important to determine phylogenetic tree clades.

st proteins are neither known cell wall structural proteins nor arabinogalactan proteins
as mentioned above, all st proteins had a signal peptide that targets them to the secretory pathway and, perhaps, to cell walls. additionally, several cell wall proteins have repeats of short oligopeptides in which amino acids with important functions, such as pro, tyr and glu, are present. taking this into account, a comparison between st proteins and structural and arabinogalactan cell wall proteins was made in order to determine whether st proteins might be a previously characterized cell wall protein type.

in this comparative analysis, the grp protein group was ruled out directly, since the content of gly in grp was higher than 28%, usually around 40-75%, while in st proteins the gly percentage was below 11%. additionally, pro was not found within the repeat sequences in grps, unlike sts.

structural proteins such as hrgps and prps are more similar to sts and present conserved regions with repeat sequences rich in amino acids such as pro, ser, val, tyr and lys
 <cit> .

comparison of the different prp types and st proteins led to the conclusion that st is not a new type of prp protein, as clearly shown in the phylogenetic tree represented in figure
6a, in which sts appear as a separated cluster. there is one common characteristic among them: the content of tyr  and its conserved position. in prps, tyr residues allow the formation of linkages by peroxidase-mediated oxidative coupling between tyrs, tyr and lignin, and/or tyr and pectic polymers. these linkages are able to interconnect structural cell wall elements
 <cit> . the presence of conserved tyr in st proteins suggests a possible structural role in the cell wall. however, theoretically st proteins cannot form intramolecular isodityrosine or diisodityrosine linkages, since their formation requires consecutive tyr
 <cit> . we cannot discard the possible formation of intermolecular bridges, although st proteins do not present the characteristic motifs described for this: vyk, ysy, yyy or ykyk. furthermore, several differences were observed between prp and st proteins. one fundamental difference was seen in the way that the repeats are arranged in the total protein sequence in prps and sts. prps had different repeats of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids along the protein sequence, depending on the prp type: ppxx  ; ppyv; pptprps; ppv, pyk, kkpcpp; pepk; pkpe, pppk. these small repeat peptides could be comparable to the characteristic hexapeptide of sts. however, the prp repeats are not included in a larger conserved domain, as happens in sts, but dispersed or arranged in tandem or in clusters in the protein sequence. another discrepancy is the pi, which was much higher in prps  as a consequence of the lower percentages  of acidic amino acids, while in the sts this percentage sometimes reached 26%, and the pi, with the above-mentioned exceptions, was acidic . a notable difference was also found in the pro content, between  <dig> and 36% in prps, while in sts it was lower than 11%.
 <dig>  a. phylogenetic tree constructed with different prp types and st protein sequences. b. phylogenetic tree constructed with different hrgp and st protein sequences. c. phylogenetic tree constructed with different agps types and st sequences. in all cases, sts appear as a clearly separate cluster. prps accession numbers : arabidopsis thaliana athprp <dig> , athprp <dig>  athprp <dig>  and athprp <dig> ; brassica napus bnaprp <dig> ; daucus carota dcaprp <dig> ; glycine max gmaprp <dig>  and gmaprp <dig> ; medicago truncatula mtrprp <dig> ; oryza sativa osaprp <dig> , osaprp <dig> , osaprp <dig>  and osaprp <dig> ; solanum licopersicum sliprp <dig> ; zea mays zmaprp <dig>  and zmaprp <dig> . hrgps accession numbers : a. thaliana athhrgp <dig>  and athhrgp <dig> ; b. napus bnahrgp <dig> ; catharanthus roseus crohrgp <dig>  and crohrgp <dig> ; g. max gmahrgp <dig> ; nicotiana plumbaginifolia nplhrgp <dig> ; nicotiana sylvestris nsyhrgp <dig> ; nicotiana tabacum ntahrgp <dig>  and ntahrgp <dig> ; o. sativa osahrgp <dig> ; phaseolus vulgaris pvuhrgp <dig> ; pisum sativum psahrgp <dig> ; prunus dulcis pduhrgp <dig> ; s. licopersicum slihrgp <dig>  and slihrgp <dig> ; solanum tuberosum stuhrgp <dig> ; vigna unguiculata vunhrgp <dig> . agps accession numbers : a. thaliana athagp <dig> , athagp <dig> , athagp <dig> , athagp <dig> , athagp <dig> , athagp <dig> , athagp <dig> , athagp <dig> , athagp <dig> , athagp <dig> , athagp <dig> , athagp <dig> , athagp <dig> , athagp <dig> , athagp <dig> , athagp <dig> , athfla <dig> , athfla <dig> , athfla <dig> , athfla <dig>  and athfla <dig> ; m. truncatula mtragp <dig>  and mtragp <dig> .

the phylogenetic tree constructed with hrgp and st sequences indicated that both proteins were also very different  and, as in the case of prp, we found several different characteristics in protein composition, pi , the content in acidic amino acids  and the percentage of pro  and tyr , which are two important amino acids in the structure of these proteins.

the above differences found among sts and both prp and hrgp indicate that sts cannot be included in these structural protein groups and the bootstrap analysis also indicated that sts are evolutionarily even more distant from hrgps than from prps.

the phylogenetic tree constructed with agps and sts confirms the separation of both types of protein. evolutionarily, agps are more separated from st than prps and hrgps . several differences were also observed in amino acid composition, excluding fasciclin-like agps . the content in acidic amino acids  and the percentage of tyr  were the clearest differences. moreover, classic agps and non-gpi agps had high pro percentages  in comparison with st , and ag peptides  had a fairly low molecular weight . the fasciclin-like type was the agp class most similar to sts upon taking into account the molecular weight, the pi and the amino acid composition, with similar percentages of pro ; the content of tyr  and acidic amino acids  was lower than in st proteins but higher than for other agps.

furthermore, the conserved regions of agp are mainly formed by glycomodules, repeats of ala-pro, ser-pro and/or thr-pro, where most of the pro  is hydroxylated and ala-pro and ser-pro are almost always hydroxylated and o-glycosylated
 <cit> . no such glycomodules were found in st proteins, pointing to a significant difference with agp.

in conclusion, if located extracellularly st proteins are a class of cell wall proteins different from any known structural cell wall proteins and from arabinogalactan proteins. furthermore, st proteins belong to tandem repeat proteins of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, unlike all other cell wall protein types that belong to proteins with repeats from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids.

st mrnas accumulate mainly in roots and under biotic interactions
study of the sequences appearing in est databases provides information about the organs and the growth conditions of the plants from which the cdna library was constructed. analysis of such information allows us to know where an st mrna is accumulating or is predominant, although the fact that the gene could also be expressed in other organs or under other growth conditions cannot be discarded.

st mrnas accumulation in plant organs
forty-nine percent of the st sequences  were found in cdna libraries made from mrna isolated from the roots or radicles of  <dig> different species, most of them in c. arietinum  and m. truncatula  . this percentage could be even higher, since 20% of the sequences  were isolated from mrna obtained from a mixture of organs or whole plants. the sequences obtained in seeds , leaves  and elongating organs such as epicotyls, hypocotyls and stems  were also significant. st mrnas have also been found in other organs, such as flowers, fruits, haustoria, buds, etc., with percentages lower than  <dig> % .

the table indicates the plant organ or tissue used to extract the mrna used to construct the cdna library where the sts were found. data were obtained from additional file
 <dig> . mixture: different combinations of organs, tissues and/or whole plants/seedlings.

analysis of the largest st family, the barrel medic family, revealed that  <dig> of the six sts  were present in roots. mtrst <dig> was also found in immature seeds and mtrst <dig> and  <dig> also in leaves. mtrst <dig> was not found in any cdna library.

apart from the origin of the mrna used to make the libraries, little is known about st location. most st est findings come from massive est analyses, but without further analysis
 <cit> . as an exception, in watermelon clast <dig> transcript accumulation  is several times higher in green fruit as compared to leaves, decreasing as maturation progresses
 <cit> . waters et al.
 <cit>  and fernández et al.
 <cit>  reported a similar transcript accumulation pattern for grape berry vvist <dig>  with a maximum in the green stage, proposing a role of st proteins in morphogenesis. vvist <dig> transcripts were also found in roots and, to a lesser extent, in stems and leaves.

the accumulation of st transcripts in different organs determined by northern blot analyses has been studied in depth in p. sativum <cit>  and c. arietinum <cit> . st transcripts were detected in epicotyls and stems, either specifically  or not . in chickpea, transcript accumulation was higher in radicles than in epicotyls, whereas in garden pea mrnas were not detected in roots. in fact, in the chickpea transcriptome database  developed by garg et al.
 <cit>  the expression profile of carst <dig>  and carst <dig>  indicated a higher transcript accumulation of both genes in roots than in shoots . in chickpea, no expression was found in mature leaves, flowers, young pods or immature seeds
 <cit> . a pod-specific st  was described in garden pea
 <cit> , in which no other st transcripts were found in cotyledons, leaves and roots. however, psast <dig> and psast <dig> mrnas were isolated in cdna-specific libraries from leaves , indicating that their mrnas were present, although probably at such low levels that they could not be detected by northern blot analyses
 <cit> .

st mrnas accumulation in plants under biotic and abiotic stress conditions
regarding plant growth conditions, while  <dig> sequences  came from plants growing under optimal conditions of light, temperature and humidity and in  <dig> the mrna origin was unknown,  <dig> sequences  came from plants growing under stress conditions or under chemical treatment, most of them under biotic interactions  with pathogenic and mycorrhizal fungi , pathogenic and n2-fixing bacteria , nematodes , parasitic plants , insect  or viruses  . they have also been found in plants under abiotic stresses  such as salinity/drought stress , pi or n <dig> starvation , n <dig> fertilization , high pi , cold acclimation  and hypoxia  .

the table indicates the growth conditions of the plant used to extract the mrna from which the cdna library, containing st sequences, was constructed.  abiotic stress;  biotic interactions;  chemical treatment. data were obtained from additional file
 <dig> .

although the isolation of st sequences in cdna libraries does not necessarily mean that st genes are expressed as a consequence of biotic or abiotic interactions, the high percentage   of st sequences found in plants under such stresses indicates that st mrnas are abundant in these growth conditions.

it is possible that stress could up- or down-regulate the expression of st genes, without complete induction or repression. for instance, as can be seen in additional file
1vvist <dig> was isolated from both ga3-treated and -untreated fruits, casuarina glauca st <dig>  from inoculated and uninoculated frankia roots, phaseolus vulgaris st <dig>  in roots growing at high and low pi, g. max  with and without several stresses, and gmast <dig> after heterodera infection, but also in uninfected roots.

moreover, the possibility that different st genes might be expressed in different growth conditions, even under different biotic interactions, cannot not be ruled out. focusing again on the barrel medic family , mtrst <dig> and  <dig> were the only two found under optimal growth conditions; mtrst <dig> was the only one in leaves under insect  attack, and mtrst <dig> was only found in a nematode  interaction. furthermore, mtrst <dig> was only found in cdna libraries constructed from mrna extracted from roots under arbuscular mycorrhizal interaction and its transcripts do not appear under other microbe interactions
 <cit> . in fact, mtrst <dig> does not undergo changes in its expression pattern during systemic defence response although it does when establishing symbiosis
 <cit> , its transcript being strongly reduced when the formation of arbuscular mycorrhiza-induced apocarotenoids was inhibited
 <cit> , and increased when myc factors were added to the medium
 <cit> . mtrst <dig> has been considered an early marker of mycorrhization
 <cit> , being up-regulated in both arbuscule-containing and non arbuscule-containing cells of mycorrhizal roots, although at a higher level in the former
 <cit> . mtrst <dig> transcripts are more abundant in uninfected roots than in roots with mature nodules
 <cit> , although they have never been found in cdna libraries from optimal growth conditions. it is important to note that a. thaliana, one of the few species that are non-mycorrhizal, does not have st genes.

six different medicago truncatula st sequences  were found. numbers indicate the number of times a specific sequence was found in each growth condition. the specific interaction can be found in additional file
 <dig> 

thus, it is possible that proteins encoded by st genes, called st proteins, have specific roles in a given interaction but also that some of them could act in several biotic stresses in different tissues, such as mtrst <dig> and mtrst <dig> for example . bearing in mind that some genes expressed in pathogen infection can also be expressed in the initial process of symbiosis
 <cit> , and since both processes activate defence mechanisms in plants involving molecular interactions between two organisms, it can be proposed that several st proteins might act in both processes. also, it has been reported that some genes are essential for the development of symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi and with n2-fixation bacteria
 <cit> . in this sense, we found st mrna sequences in n2-fixing initial phases in symbiosis with rhizobia, such as in lotus japonicus with mesorhizobium loti, m. truncatula with shinorrizobium meliloti and g. max with bradyrhizobium japonicua and with mycorrhizal fungi, as in the interaction of m. truncatula and glomus versiforme.

a special kind of biotic relationship is parasitism. in this sense, st mrnas have been isolated from the parasitic plants striga asiatica and tryphysaria versicolor when they were forming haustoria
 <cit> . this points to a possible function in the interaction between a parasitic plant and its host and strengthens the notion of a general role in interactions between organisms.

some function in abiotic stress could also be played by st proteins. in fact, as well as in optimal growth conditions
 <cit>  chickpea st mrnas have been found in the roots of drought- and salinity-stressed plants
 <cit> . however, carst <dig> and carst <dig> transcript accumulation decreases under abiotic stress, the strongest effect being under salinity and low-temperature treatment
 <cit> .

few reports can be found concerning the involvement of st proteins in physiological processes other than biotic or abiotic stress responses and the previously discussed role in morphogenesis and growth. as an example, in p. persica ppest <dig> has been reported to be the most up-regulated gene in the late adaptation to bud dormancy induced by short days, while no transcript increase was observed in a mutant without dormancy
 <cit> .

many more studies must be done to determine the actual role of st proteins in plant physiology. the analysis of mrna accumulation points to two possibilities: one, that these proteins play a common role in several processes, and two, that different members have specific roles in different processes.

CONCLUSIONS
we have described a new family of proteins called st with, at least to date,  <dig> members. their presence is limited to the plant kingdom, specifically to a few families of dicotyledonous plants. a high percentage of the sequences similar to st found in databases come from libraries of cdna from radicles and roots of plants growing under biotic and abiotic stress. they have  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid tandem repeat sequences with differential characteristics from the reported group of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid tandem repeat proteins  and also from known cell wall proteins with repeat sequences such as prp, hrgp, grp and agp.

the data obtained by our est analyses, as well as empirically
 <cit> , relate st proteins to biotic interactions as their possible involvement in symbiosis and abiotic stress. a member of the st family has been related to early fruit morphogenesis both in grape berry
 <cit>  and in watermelon
 <cit> , although its exact role in such processes remains elusive. the first studies by de vries et al.
 <cit>  and muñoz et al.
 <cit>  suggested a role in plant cell elongation in organ growth not related to light, the action of auxin and/or brassinolides, or to germination
 <cit> . the similarity to seed storage proteins has been discarded for psast <dig>  although these proteins present a certain homology
 <cit> . different sts could play different roles in plant development.

st proteins are not a shoot/stem-specific proteins nor tissue-specific, as their name initially indicated, being more related to roots, although different family members could have different locations within the whole plant and could play different roles in development. in fact the original name  is confusing for the identification of the family members.
