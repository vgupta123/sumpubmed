BACKGROUND
the human genome includes a substantial amount of interspersed repetitive dna  which is divided into several groups   <cit> . the alu family of dna repeats, which belongs to sine group, is one of the most abundant and well characterized repetitive elements. the total number of annotated alu sequences in the database of human genome is more than  <dig> million copies and their fraction in genome is about 10%  <cit> .

alu repetitive elements were first described about  <dig> years ago and were named after conserved alui restriction site , which is present in the most of studied members of the family  <cit> . the alu repeat sequence is about  <dig> bp in length and probably originated from the 7sl rna  <cit> . the details of alu repeats retroposition in human genome are still unclear and it is difficult to explain alu repeats abundance in genomic sequence  <cit> .

based on the primary structure alu repeats were divided into at least  <dig> subfamilies  <cit> . the main branches of alu subfamilies are designated by one of three possible capital letters, which indicate an age of the repeat group . additional lowercase letter and occasional numerical symbols define subfamily name. the most representative alu subfamilies are alujb, alujo, alusq, alusx, alusg and aluy  <cit> . similarity of alu nucleotide sequences within each subfamily varies from 80% to 99%  <cit>  and a data base of alu repeats includes the consensus sequences for some subfamilies  <cit> . however, quite a big difference in dna structures between all subfamilies makes difficult a presentation of general alu repeats consensus sequence covering all subfamilies and there is no such a sequence in alu repeats database  <cit> .

earlier we have proposed a simple method to carry out the restriction enzymes analysis of mammalian dna in silico based on the known dna sequences of eukaryotic genomes  <cit> . this method allows to calculate lengths of all dna fragments, which are formed after a whole genome digestion at recognition sites of restriction enzyme, and to construct the distribution diagrams of the calculated dna fragments. these distribution diagrams display distinct peaks of dna fragments of the definite lengths due to a presence of dna repeats in eukaryotic genomes. comparison of the obtained peaks in distribution diagrams and results of rat, mouse and human dna cleavage by several restriction enzymes has shown a good correspondence of theoretical and experimental data  <cit> . a detailed study of rat dna cleavage with restriction enzymes has shown a very good coincidence of dna digestion patterns in vitro and in silico for more than  <dig> restriction enzymes  <cit> . the obtained patterns of chromosomal dna cleavage exactly correspond to the theoretical patterns of the proposed consensus rat line <dig> repeat cleavage  <cit> . a similar study of human chromosomal dna digestion  <cit>  has revealed another situation, where an obtained theoretical pattern of dna cleavage is formed as a mix of alu and line <dig> repeats digestion patterns. most of small dna fragments are produced from alu repeats, whereas dna fragments of length more than  <dig> bp are formed from line <dig> repeats. in this work we have studied in details alu repeats digestion in silico. we have described an approach to analyze a big family of human alu repeats from the data base, which comprises of more than  <dig> million of homologous short nucleotide sequences. the calculated data have been compared with digestion of subfamilies' alu repeats and with experimental results of human dna cleavage by restriction endonucleases, which have been obtained earlier  <cit> .

a goal of this work is to 1) develop a software for analysis of a big number of alu repeats, 2) compare the calculation data on cleavage of the whole human genome and a set of alu repeats, 3) carry out a comparative analysis of experimental results of dna hydrolysis and theoretical data on various alu repeats families' digestion and 4) present a physical map of alu repeats cleavage with  <dig> restriction enzymes.

RESULTS
comparison of distribution diagrams for the whole human genome and the set of alu repeats
earlier we have shown that mammalian dnas hydrolysis with restriction enzymes and subsequent dna products separation in gel-electrophoresis produce cleavage patterns, which mainly correlate to the dna fragment peaks in distribution diagrams obtained by computer analysis of published genomes  <cit> . the only exception is α-satellite dna digestion products, which give clearly visible dna fragments whereas they have no corresponding peaks in diagrams  <cit> . unfortunately, the calculation of α-satellite dna cleavage patterns is impossible because of absence of multisatellite dnas nucleotide sequences in the informational databases.

the existence of peaks in diagrams is explained by the presence of a large amount of repetitive dna in eukaryotic genomes. indeed, we have shown that almost all peaks in diagrams of rat genomic dna digestion in silico correspond to the peaks of rat line <dig> consensus sequence cleavage  <cit> . the human genome differs from rat genome by a larger proportion of rather short sine repeats . as a result 30– <dig> bp dna fragments in digestion diagrams are formed from alu repeats and we have provided two distribution diagrams of alu repeats digestion in our previous work  <cit> . in this work we have developed software and carried out a detailed analysis of alu repeats cleavage with restriction endonucleases.

as indicated in "methods" each nucleotide sequence from more than  <dig> , <dig> annotated alu repeats sequences has been searched for a presence of recognition sequence of restriction enzymes, a number and positions of these sites in alu repeat sequences have been determined. then, alu repeats digestion diagram, a diagram of the obtained dna fragments number versus the length of these fragments has been plotted for each recognition sequence.

earlier we have observed a similarity between distribution diagrams of whole genome and alu repeats digestion in the case of alui and bst2ui recognition sequences  <cit> . fig.  <dig> shows a comparison of distribution diagrams of a whole genome and alu repeats digestion for recognition sites of  <dig> restriction enzymes. as it is clearly seen from the figure all peaks of  <dig> bp and less are present both in diagrams of the whole human genome digestion and in diagrams of the annotated alu repeats cleavage in silico. thus, indeed, the corresponding fragments of genomic dna are formed due to a cleavage of alu repeats. a cleavage of remaining dna forms a background curve of a whole genomic dna digestion. a structure of this background fragments curve depends mainly on gc-content of genomic dna, enzymes recognition site and has been discussed earlier  <cit> . on fig.  <dig> there are some smaller peaks in whole genome cleavage diagrams. our analysis has shown that these peaks are formed mainly due to a cleavage of human line <dig> repeat .

alignment and analysis of alu repeats
preliminary analysis has shown that alu repeat sequences differ in length. on fig.  <dig> we have presented a diagram of alu repeats number versus a length of alu repeats sequences, which are presented in data base. fig.  <dig> shows that a big number of alu repeats shorter than  <dig> bp are listed in data base. we have made some additions to 5'-truncated short alu repeats sequences to unify them for a subsequent analysis. as indicated in "methods" we have aligned all dna sequences, which originally were 5'-truncated, by adding extra nucleotides at 5'-end of alu repeats. a total number of all obtained human alu repeat sequences, which has been considered in a further analysis, is  <dig> , <dig>  these aligned alu repeats are presented at sibenzyme data base  <cit> .

at the first step we have plotted a distribution diagram of restriction enzymes recognition sites at every position of alu repeat for all aligned alu repeat sequences. fig.  <dig> shows these distribution diagrams for restriction enzymes alui and asuhpi. as we can see from fig.  <dig> there are distinct peaks of re sites in alu repeats sequences for alui and asuhpi restriction endonucleases as well as for all other enzymes, which we have studied here . for a further analysis locations of the maximal peak's value were chosen as these sites positions. it should be noted that some peaks are very close each to other  due to a common  <dig> bp deletion in positions 65– <dig>  <cit> . we have observed twin peaks in positions 99/ <dig> , 79/ <dig> and 110/ <dig> , 87/ <dig> . table  <dig> shows positions of recognition sites in aligned alu repeats sequences and a number of sites at these positions in all alu repeats . because of short deletions and/or insertions in many alu repeats sequences we have applied an approach of each site number determination as follows. every particular recognition sequence has been searched in the interval ±  <dig> bp of the position indicated in column  <dig>  in column  <dig> of table  <dig> we have presented a total number of these sites. for the further consideration we have chosen only those sites, which are present at every particular position in more than  <dig>  alu repeats sequences. in table  <dig> we have also indicated the percentage of alu repeats, which contain a given site, and this site distribution within main subfamilies .

data are given for all analyzed sequences and for six main subfamilies.

* – positions and numbers of sites which present in more than 30% of alu repeats are shown in bold.

** – because of possible overlapping the following regions were considered: 168– <dig> and 178– <dig> 

*** – because of possible overlapping the following regions were considered: 265– <dig> and 275– <dig> 

according to table  <dig> data a maximal number of restriction enzymes' recognition sites in one position is  <dig>  –  <dig> . we have got such number of alui sites at position  <dig> and bstdei sites at position  <dig>  another set of sites in a range of  <dig>  –  <dig>  includes bpu10i recognition sequence at position  <dig>  two sites of bsseci at positions  <dig> and  <dig> and two sites of bst2ui at positions 87/ <dig> and  <dig>  so, 63–64% of all aligned alu repeats sequences contain alui site at position  <dig> and bstdei site at position  <dig>  this value corresponds to a general estimation of alui sites presence in the set of alu repeats  <cit> .

at the second step we have calculated a number of all dna fragments produced in the course of alu repeats digestion at the recognition sites of the enzymes indicated in table  <dig>  in "methods" we have described a special approach to take into account the heterogeneity of alu repeats because of short deletions and insertions. in calculations of dna fragments length we have considered an accuracy ±  <dig> bp for dna fragments less than  <dig> bp, ±  <dig> bp for dna fragments 100– <dig> bp and ±  <dig> bp for dna fragments more than  <dig> bp. due to clustering effect in experiment  <cit>  the intensities of the bands, which correspond to dna fragments of similar sizes, are summarized on the gel pictures. the bigger fragments are resolved in gel-electrophoresis less effective than smaller fragments. thus, such an approximation allows us to take into account alu repeats with possible small deletions or insertions. in table  <dig> we have summarized the obtained data. for each fragment a total number of bp in corresponding peak in diagram has been determined . earlier we have shown  <cit>  that visualization of dna fragments in gel electrophoresis experiments is possible if a total number of bp in peaks in dna fragments distribution diagrams is about  <dig>  million bp and higher. dna fragments of such size are selected in column  <dig> of table  <dig> 

data for dna fragments with total bp numbers exceeding  <dig>  mln bp are shown in bold.

* if there are two positions of the site, an average value is indicated .

comparison of theoretical and experimental data
on fig.  <dig> we provide a physical map of alu repeats cleavage by various restriction endonucleases. this map has been constructed based on the data given in table  <dig>  experimental data on chromosomal dna cleavage  <cit>  are given on a left side of fig.  <dig>  there is a good correspondence of the experimental results and the theoretical data, which is discussed in details below.

alu repeats digestion at recognition sequence agct produces  <dig> dna fragment:  <dig> bp, which is produced by cleavage at positions  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> bp – at positions  <dig> and  <dig> and a small fragment  <dig> bp – at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  so, we have a common site  <dig> for all obtained dna fragments and a different location of the second alui site. surprisingly, alui site at position  <dig> is present mostly in aluy subfamily. aluy subfamily contains  <dig>  sequences and this value is higher than  <dig>  thousand of  <dig> bp fragments given in table  <dig>  this difference is, probably, because a great part of aluy sequences have only one alui site .

restriction enzyme asuhpi has three sites on alu repeats at  <dig>  99/ <dig> and  <dig>  however, human dna cleavage with asuhpi produces only one band, which corresponds to 158/ <dig> bp dna fragment  and there is  <dig> bp fragment of satellite dna cleavage  <cit> . asuhpi site at position  <dig> is present mostly in alusx and alusq subfamilies and the quantities of 61– <dig> and 61– <dig> dna fragments are less than  <dig>  million bp and are not visible in gel-electrophoresis experiments  <cit> . it's interesting to note that asuhpi site at position 99/ <dig> occurs in alujo subfamily in minimal quantities .

bpu10i cleaves human dna with formation of one visible band, which corresponds to  <dig> bp dna fragments .

as we showed earlier in our calculations  <cit>  a human chromosomal dna digestion with bsseci produced more than  <dig> thousand of  <dig> bp dna fragment and this is the highest fragments number among all studied distribution diagrams. as indicated in table  <dig> a number of  <dig> bp dna fragments in alu repeats digestion at site ccnngg is  <dig>  thousand and this value closely correlates to the data on a whole genome cleavage. in accordance with table  <dig> we see good bands, which correspond to  <dig> bp  and  <dig> bp  dna fragments and a couple of weak bands corresponding to  <dig> bp  and  <dig> bp  dna fragments. so, experimental and theoretical data on alu repeats digestion with bsseci show a good correlation. the position  <dig> occurs mainly in "old" alujo and alujb repeats.

distribution of bstdei sites in alu repeats is similar to distribution of alui sites: there is a main bstdei cleavage position at  <dig>  which is a part of bpu10i site at  <dig>  and smaller portions of alu repeats have bstdei sites at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  surprisingly, more than  <dig>  alu repeats contain dna sequence ctnag  at position  <dig>  whereas more than  <dig>  alu repeats contain site ccnngg  at the same position. these data show a presence of t and c in position  <dig> of more than  <dig> thousand and more than  <dig> thousand of alu repeat sequences, respectively. as a result we observe weak bands  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp, which correspond to dna fragments 182– <dig>  65– <dig>  65– <dig> and 47– <dig>  and  <dig> bp fragment of satellite dna cleavage  <cit> . it should be noted that alusg and aluy subfamilies practically have no bstdei site at position  <dig> 

distribution of all bstmai sites on alu repeats is more uniform and these sites are located at positions 79/ <dig>  110/ <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in all subfamilies. in accordance with a table  <dig> data and a map of alu repeats cleavage  we see all possible dna fragments  on the gel photo.

alu repeats cleavage with hinfi produced one dna fragment  <dig> bp , which may be observed on the gel photo along with  <dig> and  <dig> bp dna fragments, which are the products of satellite dna cleavage. analysis of hinfi site distribution has shown that gantc sequence at position  <dig> is presented mostly in alusq, alusx and alusg, whereas gantc sequence at  <dig> occurs mainly in alusx, alusg and aluy subfamilies.

digestion of alu repeats with bst2ui and bstsci mostly takes place at six positions:  <dig>   <dig>  87/ <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  due to a high level of methylated cg sites in human genome bstsci cleaves mainly ccwgg sites, which are bst2ui recognition sequence. thus, both enzymes have the same patterns of dna cleavage and the same band intensities on the gel photo. a shift of bstsci dna cleavage pattern was discussed earlier  <cit>  and in a further work we have studied a map of bst2ui cleavage only. three bst2ui recognition sites  coincide with locations of bsteci sites in alu repeats. sites at positions 87/ <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are presented in the most of alu repeats and we can see the same dna fragments  <dig> bp , 115– <dig> bp  and 166– <dig> bp  for dna cleavage with enzymes bstsci, bst2ui and bsteci on gel photos. quite a large portion of alu repeats have bst2ui site at position  <dig>  a corresponding dna fragment 84/ <dig> bp  we can see on the gel photo. some alu repeats have additional bst2ui sites at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  in accordance with a map of alu repeats digestion on the photo we see the additional bands, which correspond to dna fragments  <dig> bp ,  <dig> bp  and  <dig> bp . so, alu repeats digestion with bst2ui provides three couples of overlapping dna fragments:  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp,  <dig> and  <dig> bp. a good picture of the gel photo with bright bands of human dna hydrolysis with bstsci and bst2ui enzymes  may be explained by presence of alu repeats digestion fragments in doubles. alusq, alusg and aluy subfamilies contain minimal quantities of bst2ui site at position  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
a method of theoretical analysis of alu repeats sequences from the database has been proposed in this work. it includes a) a search for restriction enzymes recognition sites in all au repeats sequences, b) additional alignment of annotated alu repeats sequences with formation a new set of alu repeats sequences, c) determination of location of the restriction enzymes recognition sites in a new set of alu repeats and calculation of a number of these sites in each positions, d) calculation of a number of dna fragments, which are produced in the course of alu repeats cleavage at these sites. we also have compared data on sites' distribution among main alu repeats subfamilies. there is a definite preference in distribution of some restriction enzymes recognition sequences among different families of alu repeats, for example, alui site at position  <dig> is characteristic for "young" aluy sequences. thus, such preference may be used to characterize alu subfamilies by restriction enzymes analysis. finally, we have constructed a physical map of alu repeats cleavage by restriction endonucleases and have shown a good correspondence of theoretical and experimental data.

the suggested method of alu repeats analysis allows to simplify a study of human dna digestion with restriction endonucleases considering set of alu repeats sequences instead of the whole human genomes. thus, time and efforts, which are necessary for such calculations, may be significantly reduced.
