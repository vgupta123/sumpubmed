BACKGROUND
development of the adaptive immune system relies on the coordinated assembly of the genes encoding immunoglobulin and t cell receptor subunits in a process known as vj recombination  <cit> . in this process, one of each type of component variable , diversity  and joining  gene segments are combined to form the coding sequence of the antigen binding regions. due in part to the array of potential gene segment combinations, vj recombination events lead to the vast sequence diversity in the antigen receptor repertoire. the site-specific dna cleavage reactions in vj recombination are catalyzed by the lymphoid specific proteins rag <dig> and rag <dig> in a cell lineage and stage specific manner. the recombination signal sequence  that flanks each gene segment directs the rag proteins to the appropriate dna cleavage sites. the rss consists of both a conserved heptamer and a nonamer sequence separated by a poorly conserved spacer of either  <dig> or  <dig> base pairs. appropriate recombination only occurs between gene segments flanked by rsss of dissimilar spacer lengths, a requirement referred to as the 12/ <dig> rule.

vj recombination occurs in two distinct phases, the first of which relies largely on the rag proteins. during the first phase of recombination, the rag proteins assemble on the rsss of the two gene segments to be recombined, forming a pre-cleavage synaptic  complex. the proteins first generate a single-strand nick 5' of the heptamer sequence of the rss, producing a free 3' hydroxyl group on the coding gene segment. this hydroxyl group subsequently attacks the opposing strand in a direct transesterification reaction, generating a double-strand break at the coding gene:rss border  <cit> . under physiological conditions, hairpin formation requires that the rag proteins bind to both a 12-rss and 23-rss in a paired complex  <cit> . the generation of double-strand breaks is therefore coordinated at the two rsss undergoing recombination, assuring that double-strand breaks are not made at isolated rsss. the products of this first phase of recombination are blunt-ended rsss and covalently sealed coding gene segments. the second phase of recombination involves the opening, processing, and subsequent joining of the covalently sealed hairpin structures and the rss signal ends to form coding and signal joints, respectively. this phase relies on the action of the ubiquitously expressed proteins of the non-homologous end-joining  dna repair pathway  <cit> , although the rag proteins may function in this phase by ensuring proper dna repair through the nhej machinery  <cit> .

early studies of the rag proteins identified the minimal regions of the proteins required for catalysis  <cit> . these regions, referred to as the core proteins, demonstrated improved solubility over their full-length counterparts and have therefore served as the basis for most biochemical studies of the rag proteins  <cit> . murine core rag <dig> consists of residues 384- <dig> from the  <dig> residue full length protein, and murine core rag <dig> includes residues 1- <dig> from the  <dig> residue full length protein. core rag <dig> consists of multiple structural domains, termed the nonamer binding domain   <cit> , and the central  and c-terminal  domains  <cit> . besides the ability to recognize the rss nonamer and heptamer through the nbd  <cit>  and the central domain  <cit> , respectively, core rag <dig> contains the essential acidic active site residues  <cit> . core rag <dig> is predicted to adopt a six-bladed propeller structure  <cit>  and functions to enhance sequence-specific interactions of rag <dig> to the rss  <cit> , and possibly induce conformational changes in rag <dig> to activate dna cleavage activity  <cit> .

the non-core regions of both rag proteins, though considered "dispensable" for recombination, are well-conserved, suggesting that these regions have a functional role. notably, a number of studies have shown that core rag <dig> and core rag <dig> were significantly less efficient in the recombination of both exogenous plasmid substrates and endogenous genetic loci when compared to their full-length counterparts  <cit> . the impact of this decreased recombination efficiency was shown in experiments using core rag <dig> or core rag <dig> knock-in mice. mice expressing either core rag protein in place of its full-length counterpart demonstrated impaired b and t cell development  <cit> , with a reduction in rss cleavage and limited specific recombination events at both igh and tcrβ loci  <cit> . furthermore, recombination products showed an increased frequency of aberrant signal and coding joints, indicating that the non-core regions of the rag proteins are critical for appropriate recombination at endogenous genetic loci  <cit> .

multiple previous studies have shown that non-core rag <dig> contains a phd module  <cit> , which binds to histone h <dig> di- or trimethylated on lys  <dig>   <cit> . the interaction with the methylated histone h <dig> is required for efficient recombination on chromatinized substrate  <cit> , and also functions to stimulate the catalytic nicking and hairpin formation steps  <cit> . in a separate role, phosphorylation of thr  <dig> is a prerequisite for ubiquitination and degradation of rag <dig> at the g1-s transition of the cell cycle  <cit> .

the role of the n-terminal non-core region of rag <dig> has been more elusive. there are three separate lines of study that indicate important roles of the non-core region in the function of the rag <dig> protein. first, previous mutagenesis studies revealed regions in non-core rag <dig> that significantly impacted recombination of exogenous plasmid substrates  <cit> , including a conserved basic region   <cit>  and conserved cysteine residues within the n-terminal  <dig> residues  <cit> . second, although most of the non-core region of rag <dig> remains structurally undefined, the crystal structure of a conserved zinc dimerization domain  between residues 265- <dig> has been solved  <cit> . further, the ring finger within this domain exhibits e <dig> ubiquitin ligase activity, demonstrating autoubiquitination, as well as ubiquitination of an artificial substrate in in vitro assays  <cit> . the rag <dig> ring finger has also been shown to facilitate ubiquitination of the nuclear transport protein karyopherin alpha  <dig>  <cit>  and histone h <dig>  <cit> . how the e <dig> ligase activity on either of these latter targets affects the vj recombination process has yet to be established. third, regions n-terminal to the zdd in full length rag <dig> have been shown to mediate protein-protein interactions. for example, full-length rag <dig> co-purifies with the ku70/ku <dig> heterodimer under low stringency conditions, and this association requires the presence of non-core rag <dig> residues 211- <dig>  <cit> . in a separate study, a yeast two-hybrid approach demonstrated that a region of non-core rag <dig>  encompassed by residues 173- <dig>  mediated interactions with the transcription factor gmeb <dig> and the splicing factor sf3a <dig>  <cit> . although the full implications of these protein-protein interactions are not yet clear, these studies indicate that non-core rag <dig>  like non-core rag <dig>  plays multiple roles in the recombination reaction and its regulation.

to further our understanding of rag <dig>  we have utilized biochemical, bioinformatic, and biophysical approaches to identify the domain composition of the n-terminal non-core region of the protein. in this context, a domain is defined as an independently folded unit that can retain biological activity even if excised from the full length protein. since domains can participate in key functions of the intact protein, such as providing binding surfaces for macromolecular interactions, it will be critical to determine the domain architecture of non-core rag <dig> to obtain a detailed understanding of its function. here, we have identified domain boundaries that yielded isolation of a structurally independent domain, termed the central non-core domain , which consists of residues 87- <dig>  we show that this domain interacts strongly with zinc ions, preferentially binds double-stranded dna, and in conjunction with a neighboring non-core region contributes to nuclear localization of the full length rag <dig> protein.

RESULTS
identification of domain boundaries in non-core rag1
to characterize the non-core region of rag <dig>  residues 1- <dig> of murine rag <dig> were expressed as a maltose-binding protein  fusion construct in e. coli. expression of the non-core region in its entirety resulted in extensive proteolysis and aggregation of the protein. we therefore took a domain approach to characterize the non-core region of rag <dig>  with the goal that identification and characterization of independent structural domains would provide important insights into the function of non-core rag <dig>  in this study, we identified a structural domain in the n-terminal non-core region of rag <dig>  which we term the central non-core domain . our strategy is outlined in figure  <dig> 

noting that proteolysis frequently occurs at domain boundaries  <cit> , we first identified the proteolytic product generated during the expression of mbp-rag <dig>  using maldi-tof mass spectrometry, the size of the cleavage product generated during purification was found to be consistent with cleavage of the fusion construct occurring c-terminal to residue  <dig> . a fragment consisting of murine rag <dig> residues 1- <dig> was then expressed as an mbp fusion ). the resultant fusion protein formed a discrete monomeric species during size exclusion chromatography  .

next, we expressed the remaining region of non-core rag <dig> as an mbp fusion construct ) . though a small portion of this construct remained full-length throughout purification , this protein also underwent extensive proteolysis. analysis of the primary species observed by sec  by mass spectrometry of mbp-rag <dig> indicated that the molecular weight of the cleavage products was consistent with cleavage occurring c-terminal to residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . subcloning and expression of fusion constructs terminating at either residue  <dig> or  <dig> resulted in further proteolysis during purification . in addition, termination at residue  <dig> or  <dig> disrupts the previously described basic regions within non-core rag <dig>  <cit> . thus, we characterized the fragment consisting of residues 87- <dig> . this region contains the conserved cysteine residues previously described  <cit> . mbp fused to rag <dig> residues 87- <dig> was markedly well behaved, with no detectable proteolysis or aggregation occurring during purification .

earlier studies of non-core rag <dig> identified and characterized the zdd, which is located between residues 265- <dig>  and is at the n-terminal border to the core region of the protein  <cit> . a previous study showed that the non-core rag <dig> fragment consisting of residues 218- <dig> catalyzes autoubiquitination at residue  <dig>  <cit> . to characterize the biophysical properties of this region, we generated a fusion construct between mbp and residues 218- <dig> of rag <dig> ). we refer to this fragment as the basic-zinc dimerization domain , as it contains both the conserved basic region and the zdd. expression of this construct in e. coli resulted in fusion protein that eluted from sec in two peaks, with the peak eluting at vo likely containing aggregated protein and the second peak containing more well-behaved protein .

bioinformatic analysis of non-core rag1
next, we used bioinformatics methods to analyze the non-core region of rag <dig> in order to obtain additional corroboration as to the multi-domain architecture of this region of the protein. first, phylogenetic analysis of the n-terminal non-core region was performed using intrepid  <cit>  and conseq  <cit> , with both methods giving similar results. figure 3a illustrates the results from intrepid. there is a strikingly higher level of conservation for the region encompassing residues 100- <dig> as opposed to its flanking sequences. specifically, the mean z-score  for residues 100- <dig> is  <dig> , whereas the  <dig> residues n-terminal and c-terminal to this region have z-scores of - <dig>  and - <dig> , respectively. the region corresponding to the zdd is  <dig> , also indicating a more highly conserved domain.

multi-domain proteins can be altered through evolution by the acquisition of domains, which render additional functionalities to the protein  <cit> . the jawed vertebrate rag <dig> proteins have retained the n-terminal non-core region, including that corresponding to the cnd, the basic region, and the zdd. within the last decade, rag1-like sequences have also been found in invertebrate species  <cit> . the purple sea urchin rag1-like sequence contains an extended n-terminal non-core region  <cit> . the alignment of sea urchin rag1-like protein and murine rag <dig> has been shown in detail in a previous study  <cit> . notably, only the region corresponding to residues 100- <dig> in murine rag <dig> is present in the non-core region of the sea urchin rag1-like sequence. in contrast, the zdd is replaced with an unrelated sequence consisting of  <dig> repeats of an 8-residue sequence  <cit> . thus, the region corresponding to residues 100- <dig> likely plays an early role in the evolutionary history of the protein  <cit> .

aside from the zinc binding motifs in the zdd  of non-core rag <dig>  there is no sequence homology to known protein domains. difficulties remain in ab initio prediction of domain boundaries  <cit> . however, structural domains are often embedded within disordered or unstructured regions in multi-domain proteins, and methods to predict disordered regions in proteins are proving to be reasonably accurate  <cit> . here, we used multiple algorithms to predict disordered regions in the non-core rag <dig> sequence, with good agreement between separate methods . specifically, the regions predicted to be highly disordered immediately flank either side of residues 100- <dig>  this latter region, which closely corresponds to the cnd, and the zdd are predicted to be highly ordered, consistent with these regions folding into compact structural domains.

it is well acknowledged that the full length rag <dig> protein is problematic to work with; and as such it has not been feasible to show that the non-core domains are proteolytically resistant in the mammalian expressed full length protein. however, these bioinformatic results combined with the experimental studies on the bacterially-expressed non-core region  strongly indicate that the domain architecture of the n-terminal non-core region within the full length protein consists of two major structural domains .

it is possible that the first  <dig> residues of full length rag <dig> also fold into an independent domain; however, the low sequence conservation of this region suggests it does not play a central role in rag <dig> functions. moreover, the basic region, which links the cnd and zdd, is predicted to be disordered, consistent with our findings of multiple cleavage sites in this region .

biophysical analysis of the rag <dig> cnd in self-association, zinc binding, and protein stability
full length rag <dig> likely functions as a dimer, or higher oligomer  <cit> . both the core region and the zdd dimerize when expressed separately and when included in the same fragment   <cit> . to determine if other regions in the n-terminal non-core region of rag <dig> besides the zdd contributes to dimer formation, sec coupled with multi-angled laser light scattering  was performed. malls-sec analysis of mbp-rag <dig> and the predominant mbp-cnd species  show that both fusion proteins are monomeric . the minor form of mbp-cnd  does not appear to represent a functional form of the domain, as the aggregate did not dissociate upon reapplication to sec , and as the concentrated monomeric mbp-cnd did not form the aggregated species . malls-sec analysis of a tagless form of the cnd  confirmed that this domain does not self associate, and that mbp did not interfere with cnd oligomerization in the fusion protein . as expected, mbp-bzdd eluted as a predominantly dimeric species, although with some polydispersity . the polydispersity of this fragment is likely due to the basic region, as mbp-zdd was previously shown to be a monodisperse dimer  <cit> . based on these results, we conclude that the zdd is the only domain in non-core rag <dig> that can self-associate and contribute to oligomerization of the full-length protein.

the cnd contains multiple conserved cysteine and histidine residues, and it was previously suggested that this region of non-core rag <dig> may coordinate zinc ions  <cit> . however, the spacing of these conserved residues is not consistent with any previously described zinc binding motif. to determine if the cnd participates in zinc binding, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry  and flame atomic absorption spectroscopy  methods were used. the two methods show that the cnd  binds two zinc ions . as a control the zinc content of mbp-bzdd was also determined, and measured at four zinc ions per mbp-bzdd monomer, consistent with the known zinc-binding stoichiometry for the zdd   <cit> . treatment of cnd with the chelator dtpa was sufficient to remove the majority of zinc from the protein . subsequently, the zinc-free form of cnd, referred to as apocnd, failed to re-bind zinc ions, indicating that the removal of zinc from cnd may cause an irreversible structural change in the domain under the conditions used here. potential zinc-coordinated residues were mutated in three separate mutants, c <dig> a, c <dig> a, and c <dig> a, which were expressed and purified as mbp fusions from e. coli bl <dig> cells. although the mutants were expressed in lon-deficient e. coli bl <dig> cells, each cnd mutant underwent significant proteolysis during purification, consistent with the importance of these residues in the structural integrity of the cnd .

a the zinc content of each construct was determined using icp-ms and faas.

b data presented represent the average of two or more independent experiments.

c zinc binding results for mbp-cnd and tagless cnd were comparable. the results presented for cnd represent the average from both data sets.

d zinc binding for bzdd was evaluated for the mbp-tagged construct only.

to characterize the secondary structure of the cnd, the mbp portion of the fusion construct was removed and tagless cnd purified. investigation of cnd by far uv circular dichroism  spectroscopy  demonstrated that the domain was structured, containing  <dig> ± 4% alpha helical and  <dig> ± 2% beta sheet content . changes in signal intensity at  <dig> nm were monitored during thermal denaturation. a representative denaturation profile is shown in figure 5b. the tm values from five separate experiments ranged between 55°c to 62°c yielding an average tm value of  <dig> ±  <dig> °c. the changes in cd spectra observed during thermal denaturation of cnd were not reversible under the conditions used here. to determine the impact of zinc on the secondary structure of cnd, apocnd was also monitored using cd spectroscopy under conditions identical to those used for the zinc-bound domain. the cd spectrum of apocnd at 20°c showed a significant loss of signal at  <dig> nm indicating a decrease in alpha helical content . the cd spectra of apocnd remained unchanged after titration and incubation with zinc , consistent with our finding that apocnd did not rebind zinc after dialysis into zinc-containing buffer . significantly, the changes in cd spectra observed for apocnd closely resembled those observed for thermally denatured cnd , indicating that removal of zinc ions disrupted folding of the cnd to a similar extent as heating to 90°c.

cellular localization and mobility of rag <dig> non-core cnd and bzdd domains
previously, immunofluorescence studies showed the cellular localization pattern of full length rag <dig>  as well as various n-terminal non-core fragments  <cit> . the non-core fragments localized to varying degrees to the overall nucleus, as well as to nuclear subcompartments, such as nucleoli and nuclear speckles. although the previous study used non-core rag <dig> fragments  <cit> , the fragments did not precisely coincide with the structural non-core domains identified in the present study.

to analyze cellular localization properties of different rag <dig> regions, we generated gfp fusion constructs of the cnd, bzdd, and a combination of both domains . in addition, constructs of gfp fused to both full length and core rag <dig> were produced. each gfp fusion construct was transfected into hela cells and cellular localization of the expressed protein in fixed cells was visualized by fluorescence microscopy.

gfp-full length rag <dig> was localized primarily to nucleoli, consistent with previous results   <cit> . in contrast, the localization pattern of gfp-core rag <dig> was somewhat more variable, with the majority of cells  containing approximately half  of the gfp fluorescence signal diffusely localized in the nucleus . in the remaining gfp-core rag <dig> expressing cells, the protein was more uniformly distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm . lastly, there is a slight but apparent enrichment of gfp-core rag <dig> in nucleoli that is observed in some cells, with bright nuclear spots evident above the fluorescence intensity of protein diffusely distributed throughout the cell .

in cells expressing gfp-cnd, the localization pattern was similar in all cells analyzed with the majority of the protein localized to the nucleus in each cell  . the gfp-bzdd fusion protein was predominantly localized to nucleoli, with no protein evident in the cytoplasm . the combined non-core domains fused to gfp  also localized primarily to nucleoli . these data show that while the cnd could help direct nuclear localization of full length rag <dig>  the strong nucleolar localization of the full length protein is likely due to the basic region of the bzdd.

the relative mobilities of gfp fused to full length and non-core rag <dig> domains in live hela cells were evaluated using fluorescence photobleaching experiments . in fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  experiments, a small region of the cell was photobleached with a brief laser pulse. we monitored fluorescence recovery within the photobleached region over time by collecting a frame every  <dig> sec following application of the laser pulse. for each gfp fusion protein, fluorescence recovery was essentially complete within approximately  <dig> sec regardless of whether the protein was diffusely localized in the nucleus  or predominantly in the nucleoli ). a representative frap experiment using a hela cell expressing gfp- is shown in figure 7a. in this example 80% of the fluorescence recovered at  <dig> sec after photobleaching.

to determine the extent that nucleoli-localized gfp fusion proteins could diffuse from these nuclear subcompartments, fluorescence loss induced by photobleaching  experiments were performed with hela cells expressing gfp- . the cell nuclei were repeatedly photobleached with  <dig> s pulses, with images acquired between pulses. using this method, the diffusion of fluorophore from all nuclear regions into the path of the laser beam was determined. the loss of gfp fluorescence signals occurred throughout the entire nucleus within the timeframe of the experiment , indicating that the fusion protein could readily exchange between nucleoli and nucleoplasm subcompartments. together these frap and flip results indicate diffusion of the entire population of labeled rag <dig> construct, with a mobility comparable to that of other nuclear proteins  <cit> .

assessing sequence-specific and structure-specific dna interactions by non-core rag <dig> domains
although non-core rag <dig> is not essential for dna cleavage and binding activity, it may enhance sequence-specific interactions with the rss. we tested the ability of non-core rag <dig> domains to interact with the rss using electrophoretic mobility shift assays . increasing concentrations of the isolated domains  were incubated with a radiolabeled 12-rss and the extent of complex formation analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. first, we determined that the cnd bound to a ds dna substrate containing the wild type  12-rss . the ability of cnd to bind this dna substrate  was confirmed using fluorescence anisotropy experiments . the two independent means of analyzing protein:dna interactions yielded a dissociation constant  in the range of  <dig> - <dig>  μm. furthermore, tagless cnd demonstrated a binding affinity for the dna substrate comparable to that observed for the mbp-fusion construct , confirming that the mbp portion of the fusion construct did not contribute or interfere with cnd:dna complex formation. second, emsa results showed that the bzdd bound with relatively low affinity  to the wt 12-rss substrate . although the isolated zdd does not associate with dna  <cit> , the basic region between residues 218- <dig>  gives the entire bzdd fragment a positive charge , which appears to facilitate dna binding, as previously suggested  <cit> . lastly, mbp-rag <dig> only showed negligible interactions with dna .

even though both the cnd and bzdd could bind to the rss substrate, neither domain could form sequence-specific interactions with the rss. emsa assays using nonlabeled wt or mutant rss substrates as competitors demonstrated that the cnd did not show significant specificity for the rss nonamer  or rss heptamer  of the rss. similarly, the bzdd:rss interaction was not specific for either element of the rss as judged by competition assays .

the observed dissociation constants of the isolated cnd and bzdd domains for the rss are only of moderate affinity. if either domain recognized an as yet unidentified dna sequence, it is likely the binding affinities would be measurably higher to this dna sequence. to determine this possibility, a systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment  method was used  <cit> . in this method, non-core rag <dig> proteins  were bound to an oligonucleotide duplex containing an internal  <dig> base pairs  of randomized sequence. the protein-dna complexes were immobilized on amylose resin, washed extensively, the bound dna eluted with high salt and temperature, and subsequently amplified by pcr. however, multiple rounds of binding, elution, and amplification failed to increase the binding affinity of either fusion protein to the amplified dna, indicating that a sequence-specific interaction was not detectable under the conditions used here .

recent evidence suggests that full-length versus core rag <dig> can more effectively retain the coding end hairpin  in the post-cleavage paired complex containing both 12- and 23-rss signal ends  <cit> . it is possible that in the context of the full-length protein, the non-core domains will be juxtaposed close to the coding flanks. thus, next we asked if the cnd or cnd+bzdd showed structural specificity for different dna substrates, including ds, single stranded , or fully complementary hp structures . emsa analysis revealed that both mbp-cnd  and mbp-cnd+bzdd  bound to the ds and hp substrates with similar affinity, and to ss dna with significantly lower affinity. lastly, binding of cnd to the dna substrates was zinc-dependent, as dtpa-treated mbp-cnd showed significantly weaker complex formation with the dna substrates .

discussion
though most studies of rag <dig> have focused on the truncated, core region, the non-core region represents nearly a third of the full-length protein, is well conserved, and has been shown to influence the efficiency and fidelity of recombination  <cit> . nevertheless, its structural topology is poorly defined, in large part due to difficulties in characterizing the poorly soluble full-length protein  <cit> . to address this issue, we undertook the strategy where discrete structural domains of proteins are defined by their resistance to proteolysis  <cit> , an approach we previously used to identify two separate structural and functional domains in the core region of rag <dig>  <cit> . in the present study, we identified a previously unknown structural domain  within non-core rag <dig>  which is capable of folding autonomously. in combination with the zdd, these domains represent two-thirds of the n-terminal non-core region of rag <dig>  notably, regions within the rag <dig> gene encoding for residues at/near the cnd boundaries do not contain codons rarely found in e. coli . thus, the formation of the c-terminally truncated mbp-rag <dig> and mbp-rag <dig> fusion proteins during protein purification  were not due to premature translational termination, but are instead likely due to increased proteolytic susceptibility at the domain boundaries by endogeneous e. coli proteases during cell disruption and protein purification. further, the ability of the cnd to form a discrete monomeric species, as opposed to an extensively aggregated form, is further evidence that bona fide domain boundaries have been identified. lastly, the bioinformatic analysis is fully consistent with the cnd as a conserved, structured domain flanked by less conserved and highly disordered regions. the cnd in relation to other known motifs in the n-terminal non-core region of rag <dig> is shown schematically in figure  <dig> 

significantly, this study expands the zinc-binding capability of full length rag <dig>  it has been suggested that the non-core region that includes the cnd may bind zinc ions  <cit> . however, this had not been shown directly. we show here that the cnd coordinates two zinc ions, which are essential for the folding, stability, and dna binding functions of this domain. along with the four zinc ions bound in the bzdd, and at least three zinc ions bound in the core region of rag <dig>  <cit> , the full length protein coordinates at least nine zinc ions. these zinc ions are coordinated in distinct zinc-binding motifs, including c2h <dig> zinc fingers, a ring domain, a binuclear zinc cluster, and as yet undefined zinc motifs in both the cnd and core regions. along with the phd zinc-coordinating domain in the non-core region of rag <dig>  <cit> , the rag1:rag <dig> vj recombinase is dependent on zinc-coordination in nearly every functional role carried out by the enzyme complex during the recombination reaction, including dna cleavage  <cit> , macromolecular associations  <cit> , and regulatory functions  <cit> .

here, cellular localization and mobility properties of full length versus non-core and core regions of rag <dig> were examined. full length rag <dig>  strongly localized to nucleoli, with some protein present in the nucleoplasm, but absent the cytoplasm, consistent with previous reports  <cit> . the nucleoli-localized gfp-rag <dig> proteins showed relatively fast mobility between the nucleoli and nucleoplasm. thus, even in the absence of rag <dig>  full length rag <dig> may gain access to antigen receptor loci, as was indicated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays  <cit> . association of full length rag <dig> with nucleoli may be mediated by interactions with rna  <cit> .

within the library of rag <dig> constructs tested, the core region demonstrated the weakest nuclear localization pattern, with nearly equal distribution between the nucleus and cytoplasm in the majority of cells. these results correspond to previous findings with a rag <dig> n-terminal deletion, termed Δ, which diffusely localized throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm  <cit> .

nucleolar localization was observed with both the bzdd and core regions, with the bzdd showing the strongest ability to localize to nucleoli. the bzdd and core regions each contain clusters of basic residues, which were previously shown to contribute to nucleolar localization  <cit> . the bzdd contains the basic motif biii . the core region contains the basic motifs biv  and bv , which may both influence nuclear and nucleolar localization, albeit to weaker extent than biii  <cit> . the cnd, which contains bi, another basic motif , is predominantly nuclear with no obvious enrichment in nucleoli. this finding differs somewhat from the mutagenesis studies of spanopoulou et al.  <cit> , in which bi was reported to function as a major contributor to nucleolar localization. even with this latter discrepancy, our results and others show that the predominant nuclear localization signals of full length rag <dig> lie in the n-terminal non-core region.

full length rag <dig> appears to alter the localization pattern of full length rag <dig>  for example, transfection of the rag constructs into fibroblast cell lines resulted in co-localization of both proteins to nucleoplasm, but spared the nucleoli  <cit> . interestingly, spanopoulou et al.  <cit>  showed localization of both rag proteins at the nuclear periphery in primary thymocytes, as visualized by α-rag <dig> immunofluorescence experiments. in a fraction of cells, rag <dig> also localized within the nuclear interior in a speckled pattern. however, localization to the nuclear periphery has not been consistently observed in all lymphoid cells tested. for example, following induction of rag <dig> and rag <dig> expression in abelson-transformed pre-b cells, α-rag <dig> immunofluorescence showed diffuse localization of rag <dig> throughout the nucleoplasm, rather than at the nuclear periphery  <cit> . additional studies will be important to elucidate factors that may influence localization properties of the rag proteins.

the observation that cnd forms complexes with dna, albeit with moderate affinity, indicates that non-core rag <dig> may participate in maintaining pre- and/or post-cleavage complexes with the rss and coding flanks during vj recombination. although the cnd and cnd+bzdd did not show specific recognition of hairpin ends, the non-core rag <dig> region may interact with ds regions of the coding end. such an interaction could function to properly orient the coding ends within the post-cleavage paired complex, which may be necessary in directing the dna ends to the nhej dna repair pathway. notably, ku was recently shown to co-purify with non-core regions of rag <dig> under low stringency conditions  <cit> . although the ku:rag <dig> interaction may be indirect, it may be critical for the proper processing of dna ends. alternatively, the cnd+bzdd region of non-core rag <dig> may associate with dna within the 12- and 23-rss spacer regions or at the 3' ends of the rss , which could help to lock the vj recombinase on the dna. a recent study has shown that full length rag <dig>  in comparison to core rag <dig>  enhances contacts with the rss spacer regions, as well as influences the structure of the intervening dna between the 12/ <dig> rsss, in a paired complex  <cit> . given our results, it is feasible that the cnd is at least partially responsible for increased contacts of the full length protein with dna in the paired complex. further investigations into the contribution of the non-core regions of rag <dig> to the assembly of the rag-dna complexes formed during vj recombination will be important to elucidate the configuration of the fully intact vj recombinase on the rsss in the pre- and post-cleavage complexes.

CONCLUSIONS
all together, these results provide a clearer picture of the architecture of the non-core region of rag <dig>  as well as the ability of the non-core domains to coordinate metal ions, influence nuclear localization, and interact with dna. how these domains function together, and with rag <dig>  to coordinate their activities in the catalytic activity and regulation of vj recombination will provide a significant advancement in our understanding of this intriguing enzyme complex.
