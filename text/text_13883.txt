BACKGROUND
fluoroquinolones such as enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin are widely used in the treatment of animal disease caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . the bactericidal activity of fluoroquinolones is concentration-dependent, thus the peak level  and the amount of drug, as reflected by the area under the concentration-versus-time curve  in serum, are important predictors of the efficacy of fluoroquinolones  <cit> . enrofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone carboxylic derivative, is food and drug administration -approved for treatment of individual pets and domestic animals in the united states. enrofloxacin can be de-ethylated in vivo to its metabolite ciprofloxacin with a rate that is species-specific  <cit> . aeromonas hydrophila  is a ubiquitous gram-negative bacterium causing fatal hemorrhagic septicemia and dropsy in many commercially important freshwater fish worldwide  <cit> .

a. hydrophila is also considered one of the major pathogens threatening the freshwater fish cultivation industry including grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella, the top aquaculture species of china  <cit> . despite the severe economic loss, no vaccination against a. hydrophila infection has been commercially applied in china  <cit> . the main reason for the lack of commercial vaccines might be the existence of antigenic heterogeneity of various a. hydrophila strains in the field. until now, antibacterial drugs through oral delivery are the popular and effective choice for the control of pandemics causing by a. hydrophila. in china, enrofloxacin is one of the effective antimicrobials in grass carp farms and has been widely applied in fish ponds nationwide for over  <dig> years  <cit> .

antibiotic resistance has become a serious global problem and is steadily increasing worldwide in almost every bacterial species treated with antibiotics  <cit> . in aquaculture, the therapeutic options for the treatment of a. hydrophila infection were only limited to several antibiotics, which contributed for the fast-speed emergence of drug tolerance  <cit> . traditional one-for-all dosing guideline of enrofloxacin is not applicable any more. the failure to control bacterial disease in fish with antibiotics was most likely to result from sub-optimal therapy, irrespective of the degree of resistance. enrofloxacin oral formulations have been commercialized in china. farmers can use it to feed fish to treat bacterial infection. in fact, more and more pandemic a. hydrophila strains isolated from the diseased fish were with reduced susceptibility to enrofloxacin  <cit> . given this, there is an urgent need to develop a medication regimen that prevents the formation of drug resistant bacteria.

recently, new approaches were tested with an aim to increase efficacy of antibacterial drugs and to reduce resistance selection. it is well established that serum cmax/mic  > <dig> and auc/mic  > <dig> are required for efficient and optimal pharmacotherapy of enrofloxacin  <cit> . the mutant prevention concentration  is a new concept meant to face the increased prevalence of antibiotic resistance by using antibiotic concentrations able to prevent the selection of resistant bacteria populations  <cit> . since t>mpc, exposure time of drug concentration above mpc, served as a more important factor in preventing drug resistance, auc/mic, cmax/mic and t>mpc were important integrated pk/pd parameters.

the aim of the present study was to develop a medication regimen against a disease caused by a. hydrophila strain  in grass carp by integrating pharmacodynamic  and pharmacokinetic parameters for enrofloxacin. although enrofloxacin is widely used as antimicrobial agent, its pk or pd parameters in grass carp are lacking. 10 ~  <dig> μg/g is the dose of recommended in the industry  <cit> . to clarify the pk indices, oral dosing of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> μg/g body weight were individually examined in the study. the results of this study paved the way for establishing dosing guidelines to avoid selecting resistant mutants of specific fish bacterial pathogen with uncertain drug-susceptibility.

RESULTS
the median lethal dose  of a. hydrophila  on grass carp
a. hydrophila was the most destructive bacterial pathogen of farmed grass carp. ah <dig> strain was isolated and identified according to the method of roxana et al.  <cit>  from diseased grass carp in  <dig> . the pathogen was stored in national aquatic pathogen collection center . grass carp was susceptible to laboratory infection with isolate ah <dig>  external clinical signs of the infection included haemorrhaging and erratic swimming behavior. the seven day ld <dig> for grass carp by intraperitoneal route was  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml , which was analyzed from the data in table  <dig> by spss  <dig>  software. based on the clinical symptom and values of ld <dig>  isolate ah <dig> should be regarded as a virulent strain.

activities of enrofloxacin on a. hydrophila  in vitro
the in vitro activities of enrofloxacin on isolate ah <dig> were subsequently investigated. the mic value of enrofloxacin on isolate ah <dig> was  <dig>  μg/ml, and that of quality control strain a. hydrophila atcc  <dig> was  <dig>  μg/ml. the isolate ah <dig> was less sensitive to enrofloxacin than control strain atcc <dig>  mpc values should be considered in drawing dosing strategies since traditional mic-based dosing level might give rise to treatment failure due to the selection of drug-resistant mutant. the mpc of enrofloxacin on isolate ah <dig> was determined to be  <dig> mic , which was above the resistance breakpoint for enrofloxacin . the msw of enrofloxacin on isolate ah <dig> was determined to be  <dig>  –  <dig>  μg/ml, which reflected the difference between the measured mic and mpc values. existence of the msw allowed us to predict the likelihood for resistance selection or prevention based on achievable and therapeutic drug concentrations  <cit> . selective amplification of the non-susceptible ah <dig> population was expected to occur in the identified msw of enrofloxacin. as far as we knew, this was the first study trying to apply mpc principles to optimize therapy and reduce resistance selection of fish bacterial pathogen.

the post antibiotic effect  may contribute to the in vivo efficacy of enrofloxacin  <cit> . it was well known that enrofloxacin prevented the synthesis of bacterial dna by gyrase, the pae might represent the time for it to dissociate from the receptor binding sites and to diffuse out of the bacterium. it was generally believed that pae was concentration dependent and directly related to the exposure time  <cit> . in this study, pae of enrofloxacin was evaluated by exposure of isolate ah <dig> to it at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> times mic for  <dig> h . the pae of enrofloxacin was  <dig>  ±  <dig> h,  <dig>  ±  <dig> h,  <dig>  ±  <dig> h, respectively. the data predicted that the dosing interval deduced from the time-concentration pk curve could be  <dig> –  <dig> h longer due to the existence of pae. although the in vivo pae of enrofloxacin was still awaiting further investigation, our data at least suggested that the t>mpc seemed to be the dominant factor in drawing dose intervals since pae of enrofloxacin was comparably short.

pharmacokinetics of enrofloxacin in grass carp
hplc presents a simple, rapid, and reliable analytical method for detection and quantification of enrofloxacin and its metabolite ciprofloxacin. in our hplc system, the limit of detection  for enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin was  <dig>  μg/ml and  <dig>  μg/ml, respectively. the sample concentration was calculated by comparison of its peak area with the peak area of a nominal concentration of an external standard. the chromatography area and the concentration of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin showed a linear relationship. the standard curve equation of enrofloxacin is y =  <dig> × -  <dig>  , and the standard curve equation of ciprofloxacin is y =  <dig> × –  <dig>  . the standard was routinely corrected by the concentration factor and the recovery rate  <cit> . the linearity of our method was confirmed using the classical tests by analysis of variance.

the concentration-time profiles of serum and tissue after an oral dose of  <dig> μg/g,  <dig> μg/g, and  <dig> μg/g were separately shown in figure  <dig>  in general, high dose  resulted in a shorter time  to peak level than lower dose , and the time to reach the peak level in muscle  was much longer than serum & other tissues for all the three doses.  <dig> h post drug delivery, serum concentration of enrofloxacin was  <dig>  μg/ml,  <dig>  μg/ml, and  <dig>  μg/ml, respectively. the low elimination rate generally predicted a positive clinical result and correlated with the extensive application of enrofloxacin in controlling bacterial disease in grass carp. peak levels  of liver  was the highest, followed by kidney , serum , and muscle . these data were basically in consistence with pk parameters of enrofloxacin in other fish species  <cit> .

all the data were analysed by kinetica <dig> , the results showed that it was a two-compartment model with zero absorption in serum, liver and kidney, a two-compartment model with first-order absorption in muscle . the correlation coefficient exceeded  <dig>  and high model criteria  were obtained. listed pk parameters were demonstrated in table  <dig>  it was worth to note that model-independent parameters such as elimination half-life , area under the curve , and clearance  were calculated for each of the five fish and averaged in the table.

the serum concentration was the key factor for drug effectivity. at the tested oral dose of  <dig> μg/g,  <dig> μg/g and  <dig> μg/g in three independent experiments, the distribution half life  of enrofloxacin in serum was  <dig>  h,  <dig>  h, and  <dig>  h, respectively. auc of enrofloxacin in serum was  <dig>  μg/ml·h,  <dig>  μg/ml·h, and  <dig>  μg/ml·h, respectively. these data suggested that higher dose resulted in significant higher auc value or clinical result than lower dose, but with a similar absorption rate. the muscle concentration might be important in deciding the withdrawal time. the terminal  half life  of enrofloxacin in muscle was  <dig>  h,  <dig>  h, and  <dig>  h, respectively. the auc value of enrofloxacin in muscle was  <dig>  μg/ml·h,  <dig>  μg/ml·h, and  <dig>  μg/ml·h, respectively. these results implied that the elimination rate in muscle was low and seemed independent of the dose level at higher dose , and the similar auc value of the two dosal levels further suggested that the withdrawal time might be similar, which was ideal for disease and drug-residual control since better clinical result might be achieved by increasing the dose level while keeping a similar withdrawal time.

pharmacokinetics of metabolite ciprofloxacin in grass carp
although this study was aimed to examining potential dosage regimens for enrofloxacin against a specific bacterial pathogen, the pk parameters of its major metabolite ciprofloxacin was investigated in parallel with the analysis of enrofloxacin. it was well accepted that the rate of transformation of enrofloxacin to ciprofloxacin in aquatic animals was significantly less than that in terrestrial animals  <cit> , which suggested that enrofloxacin was mainly responsible for clinical efficacy in fish. however, the marker residue for tissues after oral dose of enrofloxacin was the sum of the enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin residues. although ciprofloxacin itself was forbidden to be used in aquatic species, the permitted residue level of ciprofloxacin in fish was  <dig> - <dig>  μg/g in most countries. thus, pk parameters of ciprofloxacin would be helpful in determining a suitable withdrawal time for enrofloxacin in grass carp.

figure  <dig> depicted the time course of metabolite ciprofloxacin concentrations in serum, liver, kidney, and muscle from grass carp after oral gavage of enrofloxacin at a dose of  <dig> μg/g,  <dig> μg/g, and  <dig> μg/g, respectively. in general, ciprofloxacin was detectable  <dig>  h after drug delivery and high dose resulted a shorter time to reach cmax. as expected, only a small portion of enrofloxacin was transmitted to ciprofloxacin. at the dose of  <dig> μg/g of enrofloxacin, the cmax of ciprofloxacin in serum, liver, muscle, and kidney was only  <dig>  μg/ml,  <dig>  μg/g,  <dig>  μg/g, and  <dig>  μg/g, respectively. similar to enrofloxacin, the time to cmax in muscle for ciprofloxacin was significantly longer than in serum and other tissues. for example, the tmax for serum, liver, kidney, and muscle at the dose of  <dig> μg/g was  <dig>  h,  <dig>  h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively.

analyzed by kinetica <dig> , the concentration-time profiles of ciprofloxacin could be described by a one-compartment model . the correlation coefficient exceeded  <dig>  and high model criteria  were obtained.

listed pk parameters were demonstrated in table  <dig>  by comparison of the auc of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin at different dosage , the transformation rate of enrofloxacin to ciprofloxacin in serum was determined to be  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. in liver, the rate was  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively; in kidney, the rate was  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively; in muscle, the rate was  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. although ciprofloxacin demonstrated a similar residue time  than enrofloxacin, the cls of ciprofloxacin was higher than enrofloxacin at all the three doses, which suggested that the withdrawal time could be decided according to the time to reach zero residue level of enrofloxacin since the elimination rate of ciprofloxacin was faster.

dosing guidelines of enrofloxacin based on integrated pk/pd parameters
overuse and misuse of antimicrobial drugs had favoured the growth of resistant organisms. inappropriate dosage regments included misuses in dose, dosage interval, duration of treatment, route and conditions of administration. in this study, we focused on dose and dosage interval selection. traditional pk/pd indices  have been proposed to predict the success or failure of therapy, which only considered one pd biomarker, mic. although positive clinical outcome might be achieved by a dosage regimen based on these indices, it didn’t rule out the possibility of selecting drug-resistant mutant. challenged by the emergence and spread of various resistance strains worldwide, the concepts of msw and mpc provided new conceptual basis for pk/pd approaches in deciding dosing guidelines: treatments should maximize the time during which enrofloxacin cocentrations at the site of infection were above the mpc, and minimize the time during which these concentrations were in the msw. thus t>pc, instead of of t>mic, was considered the most important factor in deciding dose regimens for the prevention of mutant selection. although tissue drug concentration demonstrated difference with serum, serum concentration was more relevant in predicting antibiotic efficacy. thus, serum pk/pd parameters were the major data that was based to draw a dosing guideline here .

in general, auc24/mic >  <dig> and cmax/mic >  <dig> predicted a clinical outcome of enrofloxacin  <cit> . in our analysis, auc24/mic and cmax/mic of enrofloxacin in serum were  <dig>  and  <dig>  at the dosage of  <dig> μg/g, respectively;  <dig>  and  <dig>  at the dosage of  <dig> μg/g, respectively;  <dig>  and  <dig>  at the dosage of  <dig> μg/g, respectively . the data suggested that a dosage more than  <dig> μg/g might achieve good enough therapeutic result. however, the t>mpc for the  <dig> μg/g dosage was only  <dig> h, while t>mpc for the  <dig> μg/g dosage could reach  <dig> h. to prevent selection of resistant mutant, the dosage interval for the level of  <dig> μg/g was  <dig> h, which suggested a twice-daily dose. in contrast to it, once-daily dose of  <dig> μg/g was adequate for the maximum time of enrofloxacin concentration above mpc. apparently, dosage level of  <dig> μg/g was more cost-effective. pae of enrofloxacin at both these two dosages were 1– <dig> h in our assay, thus pae wouldn’t significantly affect the choice of dosage interval for enrofloxacin in grass carp.

elisa r et al.  <cit>  suggested that the efficacy of administering enrofloxacin at  <dig> mg/kg in medicated water to turkeys was evaluated by applying a pk/pd approach to the kinetic parameters obtained after oral pulsed administration and to the mic values of avian pathogenic escherichia coli  strains isolated from commercial turkey flocks. the results were different from ours because of different tested animal species and pathogens, more importantly due to the different mic values. study on pk-pd indices of enrofloxacin in escherichia coli o78/h <dig> infected chickens  <cit>  also showed that pk-pd studies should include not only auc/mic and cmax/mic estimation but also determination of mpc values, which could describe better response of bacterial strain to the used fluoroquinolones. the high dose  of enrofloxacin was better than low dose  for efficient eradication of bacteria.

reasonable dosage regimen should be based on pk/pd studies and determined by practical application of the test animals. the size of the dose and dosing interval were the key indices to meet the requirement of positive clinical outcome of fish: enough time of in vivo therapeutic concentrations, no adverse effects on the body, and acceptable withdrawal period. usually concentration-dependent antibacterial drugs, like enrofloxacin, should be delivered through once-daily dosing approach, which was crucial for higher cmax or cmax/mic ratio to maximize the opportunity to get the best bactericidal action and clinical effect. the fact that gram-negative bacteria became temporarily and reversibly adaptive resistant  <dig> h after administration of antimicrobial drugs also suggested that longer dosing interval could reduce the risk for development of adaptive resistance by microorganisms  <cit> . thus, once-daily drug delivery also contributed to maximize the bacterialcidal effect of enrofloxacin by avoiding adaptive resistance.

recommended withdrawal time based on the elimination rate of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin
many countries protected consumer health from possible drug residues in fish by setting tolerable concentrations of drug residues, and surveillance agencies had been checking for compliance with the relevant directives. to ensure delivery of safe fish products to consumers, the withdrawal time of drugs must be respected  <cit> . it was worth to mention that the elimination rate of both enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin was slowest in muscle. thus, the muscle residue levels apparently represented the length of withdrawal period. from the concentration-time equations of both enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin at a dosage of  <dig> μg/g in muscle , it would take at least  <dig> d for enrofloxacin  and ciprofloxacin  to be depleted to a permitted residue level of  <dig> μg/kg. according to the present data, the proposed withdrawal period in grass carp should not be less than  <dig> d. both enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin levels reached to the detection limit of our hplc system at  <dig> d after the dosage of  <dig> μg/g, and became undetectable at  <dig> d post drug delivery. this result partially validated our pk/pd parameters. however, the present study didn’t consider the effect of continuous drug delivery  on the elimination rate of enrofloxacin or ciprofloxacin, a withdrawal period of more than  <dig> d might be expected.

CONCLUSIONS
the pd parameters  of a. hydrophila ah <dig>  isolated from grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella, were characterized. the pk parameters in serum and tissues  of enrofloxacin following a single oral treatment in grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella at three different dosage levels  were investigated. integrated pk/pd parameters  suggested that once-daily dosage of  <dig> μg/g predicted a positive clinical outcome and minimize the selection of drug-resistant ah <dig> mutant. our approach in combining pk data with pd parameters  was the new effort in aquaculture to face the challenge of drug resistance by drawing a specific dosage guideline of antibiotics.
