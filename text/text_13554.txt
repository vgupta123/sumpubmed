BACKGROUND
pd is heterogeneous. despite the great strides made recently, we still do not have a clear picture of the genetic architecture of pd, partly because not all the genes have been identified, and partly because we do not know if a given gene is associated with all or a subtype of pd. an important outcome of gwas will be to use the vast information content that has been gained  <cit>  to define disease subtypes based on their genetic associations. as a starting point, we posit that using surrogates for the underlying heterogeneity may help define the disease subtypes that each gene is associated with and may also reveal genes that were previously masked by this heterogeneity. here, we use family history as a surrogate. the majority of pd  is non-familial . the remaining 15%-30% of pd patients have a positive family history , but rarely do their kindreds display a mendelian inheritance pattern . mendelian-pd has been linked to pathogenic mutations in snca, lrrk <dig>  park <dig>  pink <dig>  dj <dig>  atp13a <dig> and vps <dig>  <cit> . the vast majority of familial-pd remains idiopathic. the genetic distinction between idiopathic familial-pd and sporadic-pd, if any exists, is unknown.

idiopathic pd involves complex interactions between the genome and environmental exposures  <cit> . it is operationally assumed that the same set of susceptibility genes predispose to familial and sporadic-pd. in fact, gwas have successfully uncovered numerous susceptibility loci without separating the subtypes  <cit> . we hypothesized that familial-pd and sporadic-pd have different genetic structures. we acknowledge that since genetic disease can manifest without a family history due to incomplete penetrance , and environmentally-induced disease can cluster in families due to common exposure, there must exist an invisible overlap between sporadic and familial-pd. however, they might differ in the relative burden of incompletely penetrant mendelian genes vs. genes that confer susceptibility to environmental causes. there is evidence in the literature that supports this notion: consider three well-established pd-associated genes: gba, lrrk <dig>  and hla. gba mutations are significantly more common in familial than in sporadic-pd  <cit> . lrrk <dig> g2019s is also significantly more common in familial than in sporadic-pd  <cit> . hla, on the other hand, is more strongly associated with sporadic-pd than with familial-pd  <cit> . there are often no overt phenotypic differences between these genetic subtypes. subtle clinical differences were only detected after the genes were identified and subtypes were defined genetically. this in itself underscores the importance of finding the genes.

here we report the first gwas stratified by sporadic and familial-pd which identified a previously unknown pd susceptibility gene in sporadic-pd. we also present evidence for distinct patterns of associations for several well-established pd susceptibility loci with familial and sporadic subtypes.

methods
this study was approved by institutional review boards at the participating institutions: albany medical center, emory university, kaiser permanente northwest division, new york state department of health, oregon health & sciences university  and the department of veterans affairs va puget sound health care system . all study participants gave informed consent. all patients and most control subjects gave written signed consent; a portion of control subjects, recruited at ohsu and vapshcs, who wished to remain anonymous read the written informed consent and gave verbal consent as approved by the institutional review boards at ohsu and vapshcs respectively. all participants were adults and gave consent on their own behalf. no parents or guardians were asked to consent for the subjects. subjects were from ngrc and included  <dig> persons with pd  and  <dig> controls . pd was diagnosed by movement disorder specialists using uk/ninds diagnostic criteria  <cit> . controls were free of neurodegenerative disease,  <dig> of them were examined by a neurologist. all  <dig> subjects were confirmed as genetically unrelated . familial-pd was designated for cases with one or more first or second-degree relatives with pd; sporadic-pd was all other cases. there was no significant difference between familial and sporadic cases in age at recruitment, age at onset, gender, percentage of ashkenazi jews, and the inverse association of smoking and coffee with pd .

the genome-wide genotype data were generated by our group and are publically available on dbgap . standardized subject selection criteria, protocols and subject characteristics were used which are published  <cit>  and are also available online  with complete genotype and phenotype data on the entire ngrc cohort . genome-wide genotyping was performed on dna from whole blood using the illumina humanomni1-quad_v1-0_b array  <cit> .  <dig>  snps passed quality-control . an additional  <dig>  million snps with frequency ≥ <dig>  were imputed with high fidelity  using the  <dig> genomes phase i integrated variant set release v <dig> and the impute v. <dig> . <dig> software  <cit> . the analyses were conducted on the total of  <dig>  million snps. for rs <dig> , the call rate for individuals with imputed genotype probability ≥90% was  <dig>  in cases and  <dig>  in controls. genotype frequencies in controls for rs <dig> were in hardy weinberg equilibrium .

for replication, we used cases and controls from the ninds human genetics dna and cell line repository . we obtained the ninds gwas data  <cit>  from dbgap . we used only white non-hispanic subjects. the sample size was  <dig> cases  and  <dig> controls. we imputed the two snps of interest on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> with high confidence . in addition, we had purchased  <dig> pd dna samples  from the ninds repository. we directly genotyped the dna samples using taqman. the gwas dataset and our dna samples had only  <dig> cases in common. this allowed us to combine the non-overlapping segments of the two datasets to attain a larger sample size, as well as an opportunity to validate imputation vs. genotyping results using the overlapping  <dig> cases. the genotypes, taqman vs. imputation, for the top signal at chromosome  <dig> matched 100% for these  <dig> individuals. call rates were  <dig>  for genotyped cases,  <dig>  for imputed cases with genotype probability ≥90%, and  <dig>  for imputed controls with genotype probability ≥90%. controls were in hardy-weinberg proportions . the final sample size for replication was  <dig> cases  and  <dig> controls, all from the ninds repository.

statistical analyses for gwas were performed using probabel v. <dig> -9d  <cit>  adjusting for age at blood draw, sex and two principal components; and using r version  <dig> . <dig>  for replication adjusting for sex and study. differences in allele frequencies of sporadic vs. familial cases were tested using logistic regression. conditional analysis was conducted using logistic regression. p values shown for replication of chromosome  <dig> signal are one-sided, due to the directionality of the hypotheses being tested  <cit> . linkage disequilibrium  was assessed using haploview v- <dig>   <cit>  and locuszoom  <cit> .

we checked the  <dig> snps in the chromosome  <dig> peak  for evidence of association with gene expression in expression quantitative trait loci  databases  and in published eqtl studies for variants associating with gene expression in the brain  <cit> .

RESULTS
known loci
when gwas data were analyzed without stratification , we recovered snca as the strongest signal; hla, which also reached genome-wide significance; and mapt, which had a clear peak but fell below the significance threshold . it is well established that polymorphisms in snca, mapt, and hla are associated with pd; it is not known however if their effects are ubiquitous across all pd or stronger in sporadic or familial subtype.

the top hit for snca region was rs <dig> at the 3′ of the gene . this variant was also the most significant marker in both sporadic-pd  and familial-pd . there was no difference in the snca rs <dig> allele frequencies in familial and sporadic-pd .

the top hit for hla was rs <dig> in intron  <dig> of hla-dra . this association was strong in sporadic-pd  but weak and statistically non-significant in familial-pd . the difference between sporadic and familial-pd in the frequency of hla-dra rs <dig> alleles was significant .

within the mapt region, defined from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  and including plekhm <dig>  mapt, nsf and wnt <dig> genes,  <dig>  snps gave evidence for association with pd . the effect sizes for the  <dig>  snps were always greater in familial-pd  than for sporadic-pd . moreover, nearly every snp  achieved higher statistical significance in familial-pd  than in sporadic-pd . the gwas signal for the mapt region peaked at p = 8×10- <dig> in familial-pd vs. p = 2×10- <dig> in sporadic-pd. the sample size for sporadic-pd was 3-times larger than familial-pd and therefore power was not a limiting factor in this case because the association was strong in familial-pd despite the smaller sample size.

new locus
the gwas on sporadic-pd  revealed two signals, , one on the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  and another on chromosome  <dig> . the gwas on familial-pd  did not reveal any statistically significant signals .

we tested the new sporadic-pd signals in an additional  <dig> sporadic-pd cases,  <dig> familial-pd cases and  <dig> controls from the ninds repository . the signal on chromosome  <dig> replicated. in sporadic-pd, the top chromosome  <dig> snp, rs <dig>  gave preplication = 6×10- <dig> with or =  <dig>  which was in the same direction as ngrc and therefore boosted the significance of the combined data to ppooled = 4×10- <dig>  the chromosome  <dig> signal did not replicate .

the confirmed signal maps to the short arm of chromosome  <dig> at p <dig>  the signal is a strong peak with  <dig> snps that achieved 4×10-8 ≤ p < 10- <dig> for association with sporadic-pd in the ngrc dataset. we defined the new locus based on the location of these  <dig> snps as a  <dig> kilo base-pair  region from base-pair   <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> 

we performed sensitivity analysis testing association of the top snp, rs <dig>  within subgroups of sporadic-pd classified by sex, age at onset, genotype , exposure , recruitment site, european countries of ancestral origin, and ashkenazi jewish heritage. association of rs <dig> with sporadic-pd was robust in every stratum with no evidence of heterogeneity across strata .

four pd loci have been mapped to chromosome 1p, namely, park6/pink <dig>  park7/dj <dig>  park9/atp13a <dig>  and park <dig> . the new locus is more than  <dig> mega base-pairs  away from the closest known pd locus, which is park <dig>  we tested ld between the snps that reached p < 10- <dig> for association with sporadic-pd  and snps that were in or within ±10 kb of dj <dig> , pink <dig> , atp13a <dig>  and park <dig> . there was no correlation between the new locus and the known loci . we therefore conclude that the signal identified here represents a previously unknown pd susceptibility locus.

the associated region maps onto a poorly-annotated gene, huseyo . huseyo is transcribed  <cit>  but little is known about the putative protein. rs <dig>  which gave or =  <dig>  with p = 1×10- <dig> for association with sporadic-pd is predicted to cause a non-synonymous substitution  in the putative protein. however, when we conditioned on the strongest signal , the signal for the amino-acid changing snp was lost . the top snp, rs <dig>  also dropped in significance but was not abolished when conditioned on the amino-acid changing snp . these results suggest neither of these snps can explain the association signal entirely, rather they are probably tagging an as yet unknown disease-associated factor in the region.

there are several genes in the region  including vcam <dig>  slc30a <dig>  s1pr <dig> and olfm <dig> that could be considered plausible candidate genes for pd based on their known functions . to explore the possibility that the new signal is tagging a linked gene, we examined the pattern of ld in the region . using rs <dig> as the anchor we found that strong ld  extended only 8 kb telomeric and 16 kb centromeric; moderate ld  extended 8 kb and 100 kb and marginal ld  extended 30 kb and 157 kb. therefore, even the closest genes to this signal  were outside the region of marginal ld with it. to be specific, there was no ld between the  <dig> snps of the new signal and snps in or within ±10 kb of olfm <dig>  or s1pr <dig> .

the block of snps that showed the strongest association with sporadic-pd  overlaps with a dna sequence that contains strongly marked regulatory regions in the encode database  <cit>  . we searched five eqtl databases and published expression data on human brain  and did not find evidence for any of the snps being an eqtl.

discussion
although pd is recognized as a complex and heterogeneous disease, it has been treated as a single entity in most prior gwas. while gwas have been enormously successful, the discoveries to date are only a fraction of the information content that these large and expensive datasets encompass. in this paper, we show that accounting for aspects of disease heterogeneity, in this case family history, could give new insights into the genetic architecture of disease. stratifying by family history, we discovered and replicated a new locus for sporadic-pd which had escaped detection in un-stratified gwas. we also detected distinct patterns of disease associations for some of the previously established pd susceptibility genes. we did not detect any new signals for familial-pd, which is not surprising because the sample size was small. in order for this approach to work, the power gained by reducing heterogeneity must outweigh the power lost to decreased sample size.

this is the fifth pd locus to be mapped to chromosome 1p, which including dj <dig>  atp13a <dig>  pink <dig>  and park <dig>  was already coined as a pd hot spot. a multiple sclerosis  susceptibility locus  <cit>  also maps to chromosome 1p, only ~200 kb away from the signal for pd. the gene for ms has not been identified. there are several plausible candidate genes for pd in the region . s1pr <dig>  encodes a lipid g protein-coupled receptor involved in cell-cell adhesion, which affects differentiation of endothelial cells and has a crucial role in immune response  <cit> . vcam <dig>  mediates leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion and signal transduction, and is critical for adult neurogenesis by maintaining the structure and function of the adult forebrain subventricular zone where neuronal stem cells give rise to neurons  <cit> . slc30a <dig>  encodes the zinc transporter  <dig> protein   <cit> . zinc is required for synaptic neurotransmission and can also act as an antioxidant  <cit> . zinc accumulates selectively in the substantia nigra of pd brains  <cit> , and in rodents, is shown to both enhance and reduce excitability of dopaminergic neurons  <cit> . encode data  <cit>  show strong markings within the most significant region of pd association that are predicted to be transcription factor binding sites, dnase hypersensitivity clusters, and h3k27ac histone marks, which indicate active enhancers of gene expression  <cit> . we did not find compelling evidence for the pd-associated snps being eqtl. the expression data and in-silico methods for combining disease-association and expression data are evolving rapidly. studies agree that eqtl patterns vary across tissues and by cell type  <cit> . thus future studies will require not only more enriched eqtl datasets  but also a larger variety of tissues and specific cell types.

prior gwas have identified over  <dig> susceptibility loci for pd , of which snca, mapt and hla have the strongest signals in our data. there is compelling evidence to suggest that association of pd with snca and hla involves variations in gene expression  <cit> . in contrast, there is little information on the underlying mechanism of the association of pd with mapt. here, we detected distinct patterns in sporadic and familial subtypes. snca was associated with all-pd, mapt was associated primarily with familial-pd, and hla was associated only with sporadic-pd. we also explored differential associations with familial vs. sporadic-pd for all genome-wide significant signals from published studies . these distinct patterns can help to generate new hypotheses and to select subtypes of pd for specific research questions. the result for snca would suggest an important and central role for this gene in all forms of pd, which is not a novel thought, considering that α-synuclein is a major component of lewy-bodies and a ubiquitous diagnostic hallmark of pd. we hypothesize that the stronger association of mapt with familial-pd is indicative of an incompletely penetrant genetic factor, and that pedigrees may be more informative in studies of mapt and pd. whereas the seemingly exclusive association of hla with sporadic-pd suggests that that risk allele is not a cause of disease, rather it might be a genetic susceptibility to an environmental agent. thus, we suggest that consideration of pd-relevant hla markers may be particularly relevant to studies of epidemiology, exposures and infectious origins of pd.

CONCLUSIONS
we discovered and replicated a new locus for sporadic-pd which had escaped detection in un-stratified gwas. this demonstrates that by stratifying on a key variable the power gained due to diminished heterogeneity can sometimes outweigh the power lost to reduced sample size. we also detected distinct patterns of disease associations for previously established pd susceptibility genes, which gives an insight to the genetic architecture of the disease and could aid in the selection of appropriate study population for future studies.
