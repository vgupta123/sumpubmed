BACKGROUND
visualising nucleic acids in situ may provide highly significant biological information at a cellular level. detecting nucleic acid in a single cell routinely employs fluorescence in situ hybridization . traditionally, fish requires the use of single probes labelled with multiple fluorophores  <cit>  or multiple probes labelled with a single fluorophore  <cit>  to allow visualization . recent advances in the use of rolling circle amplification from padlock probes  <cit>  and branched dna probes  <cit>  have significantly improved signal to noise ratios as well as sensitivity during fish detection. however, the requirement for relatively large target sequences makes these approaches unsuitable for visualizing small size rnas, such as mirnas. alternative approaches include molecular beacons  <cit> , ms2-gfp  <cit> , quantum dots  <cit>  or sub-diffraction microscopy, however, have inherent technical and instrumentation constraints, making them impractical for mainstream use to answer biological questions.

to improve the limitations of nucleic acid detection, we modified a commercially available proximity ligation assay  to detect individual copies of nucleic acids. pla was originally designed for detecting co-localization of proteins within a 40 nm distance  <cit> . the intended detection of co-localized proteins via pla relies on the use of primary antibodies to the proteins of interest and two species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to short dna sequences, which can interact with two short dna oligonucleotides to form a circularized sequence. this sequence is then ligated, amplified via rolling circle dna polymerization, and the amplified sequences are hybridized with fluorescent oligonucleotide probes, resulting in an approximate two hundred-fold amplification of the original signal.

here we have modified the pla technology to visualise nucleic acids in fixed cells. the method incorporates probing target nucleic acid sequences with a modified fish protocol combined with detection of probe binding with a commercially available pla based kit . initially, target-specific oligonucleotides coupled with biotin are hybridised to the gene of interest. subsequently an anti-biotin primary antibody is used to bind to the biotin labelled probe, and finally the pla method detects the conjugated target complex to generate an o-fish signal . in this study we have used o-fish to visualize mir146a in both mammalian and avian cells, demonstrating its capacity to detect mirnas. in addition, we used a hiv- <dig> model system to illustrate the sensitivity of o-fish detection, which may reach as little as 1– <dig> copies of nucleic acids in a single cell. in this model we were able to detect both hiv- <dig> genomic rna and newly synthesized viral cdna allowing visualisation of nucleic acids at various stages of the viral reverse transcription process. unexpectedly, we also observed that certain hiv rna sequences are only transiently available for o-fish detection, implying o-fish can potentially be used for in situ probing of temporal nucleic acid structures.

RESULTS
to test the o-fish technology we used a hiv- <dig> virus system since the viral genome has a well-defined copy number within each hiv- <dig> virion. for retroviruses, such as hiv- <dig>  two near identical copies of the rna genome are packaged into the virion  <cit> , which makes hiv-1-infected cells excellent reference samples to assess the sensitivity and specificity of this novel nucleic acid detection system. a biotinylated 26-nucleotide probe targeting the hiv- <dig> pol region  was used to detect the presence of hiv- <dig> rna genomes in hiv- <dig> infected lymphoid cells. o-fish signals were detected in the hiv- <dig> infected cells , at levels clearly discernible from minimal background signals observed in the mock-infected control . the data demonstrates that o-fish pol rna detection is highly specific and is able to distinguish hiv- <dig> nucleic acids from host cellular rna. in addition we have shown that fluorescently labelled hiv- <dig> virions do not co-localise during infection, , therefore the observed o-fish signals are derived from independent viral rna genomes . these data indicate that the o-fish procedure may detect as few as  <dig> copies of nucleic acid.

in order to probe for cdna viral replicative products in hiv- <dig> infected cells we used two additional biotinylated 26-nucleotide probes. early viral cdna products were detected using a negative sense probe targeting strong stop cdna and intermediate viral cdna products using a probe targeting gag cdna . the time course experiments show the detection of increasing viral cdna products over time by quantitative pcr  . when o-fish was targeted to strong stop cdna and gag cdna in mt <dig> cells there was an increase in o-fish signals at 4–6 hours post-infection relative to the mock-infected control . the o-fish signals detected using the strong stop and gag probes throughout the infection time course are consistent with the observations of strong stop cdna and gag cdna identified by qpcr , suggesting that the strong stop cdna and gag cdna detection by the o-fish method reflects the biology of the hiv- <dig> replication-cycle. furthermore, as it is generally accepted that only one copy of viral cdna is derived from the reverse transcription complex, these data suggest that our o-fish probes may detect as little as one copy of viral nucleic acid, although, this is somewhat complicated by background levels. to ensure the reproducibility of these observations, a parallel hiv- <dig> infection was carried out with an alternative lymphoid cell line, jurkat cells, resulting in similar strong stop cdna and gag cdna o-fish signals . these data further support the reliability and reproducibility of our o-fish method. to further confirm the reliability of the o-fish method we designed experiments to test the specificity of the o-fish protocol. due to the small size of the target nucleic acid sequences used for detection, the addition of rnase/dnase enzymatic treatments for background reduction proved impractical due to the difficulty in achieving the complete nucleic acid digestion required to abrogate detection. as an alternative, a reverse transcription inhibitor azt was used to block synthesis of hiv- <dig> cdna and evaluate the specificity of our strong stop cdna and gag cdna o-fish signal. samples were treated with azt then analysed at 12 hours post-infection, to allow maximal hiv- <dig> replication and thus o-fish signals. as expected, there was a dose-dependent reduction of detected hiv- <dig> viral cdna in the presence of azt , which additionally demonstrates the specificity of the strong stop cdna and gag cdna o-fish method.

the o-fish method was also used to examine structural rearrangements of nucleic acid targets. we again used hiv- <dig> as a model since hiv- <dig> rna may undergo structural rearrangements in the early steps of the replication cycle  <cit>  and thus may limit the o-fish probe binding to its target due to the initial occupancy of the primer binding site by trna and the absence of newly transcribed viral cdna. moreover, there is a lack of direct evidence examining the structural rearrangement hypothesis from hiv- <dig> infected cells  <cit>  thus prompting the use of ofish to examine structural conformational changes. to examine the hiv- <dig> structural conformations, a biotinylated  <dig> nucleotide probe was targeted towards the 5’utr region of the hiv- <dig> rna genome to assess the accessibility of hiv- <dig> 5’ u5/primer binding site  sequence during the early phase of infection . we have found that the 5’ r-pbs sequence was transiently available for our 5’ u5/pbs o-fish detection at 2 hours post-infection with reduced levels of detection at  <dig> and 4 hours post-infection as seen in both mt <dig>  and jurkat  hiv- <dig> infected cells. whilst the reduction of 5’ u5/pbs sequences between  <dig> and 4 hours post-infection is as expected and can be explained by rnaseh mediated degradation of hiv- <dig> rna genome, the increase in detected 5’ u5/pbs sequences between  <dig> and 2 hours post-infection was an unexpected observation.

as the hiv- <dig> rna genome is not replicated in infected cells until later time-points this increase is not due to an increase in the number of rna genomes in the cell. instead, we suggest that the increase in detected signals results from either the differential occupancy of primer trna on the pbs and/or structural rearrangements of viral rna genomes during the early steps of hiv infection. rna rearrangement is likely to be a critical regulator of hiv- <dig> biology  <cit>  and is therefore an area of much research. the o-fish method has the potential to provide a means to interrogate the conformational rearrangement of hiv rna during replication or rna structural rearrangements in general and thus may provide supporting data for speculated rna structures.

to validate whether o-fish can detect small size rnas that are as small as mirna, we used a 19-nucleotide o-fish probe to detect mir146a expression levels in both chicken df <dig> and human hela cells. mir146a levels are linked to the control of type  <dig> interferon  <cit> , and are altered upon stimulation during virus infection  <cit>  or virus mimics such as dsrna polyinosinic: polycytidylic   <cit> . upon pic treatment, significant differential patterns of mir146a distribution were seen in both df <dig>  and hela  cells. the contrasting changes in mir146a levels induced by pic treatment in the cell types tested  were in agreement with qrt-pcr analysis . minimal background signal was detected when the biotinylated mir146a probe was not used in the o-fish reaction , illustrating o-fish can be used to detect small rna sequences that are ~ <dig> nucleotides in length, such as mir146a.

the data shown here not only provide a proof of concept for the o-fish protocol but also demonstrates specific detection of both the hiv- <dig> positive sense rna genome of infecting virions and viral cdna generated from reverse transcription in the natural target cells of hiv- <dig>  the use of very short oligo probes combined with a novel signal amplification method provide the flexibility for this method to be used to detect very short nucleic acid target sequences in cells. here we have established that this allows both the detection of specific cdna products, which are often both short and scarce in nature, during the hiv- <dig> reverse transcription process and native cellular mirnas. in addition, we have observed data that suggests this method can also be applied to probing rna structure and binding events. this method has the potential to be expanded to detection of viral nucleic acids in additional virus models providing an important tool for biologists to unravel complex viral transcriptional processes. furthermore, the ability of this method to detect short cellular nucleic acid sequences, such as mirnas, shows that o-fish can be easily adapted for use outside the field of virology, and may prove to be a useful tool for examining more general processes in cell biology.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our data show that o-fish can detect low copy numbers of nucleic acids that are as little as 20-nucleotides in length. additionally, o-fish provides a new method to identify the subcellular distribution of nucleic acids and mirnas during biological processes. furthermore, by taking advantage of certain newly synthesized viral nucleic acids that are unique to infectious viral particles, o-fish could also be used to discern and track the low percentage of functional viruses during infection. moreover, o-fish may provide data to support hypothesised rna structural rearrangements as we have observed in the context of hiv- <dig>
