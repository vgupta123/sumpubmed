BACKGROUND
influenza virus infections are considered a significant public health problem given that they cause seasonal epidemics and recurring pandemics  <cit> . there were more than  <dig>  cases of infections, and  <dig>  human deaths attributed to the  <dig> global h1n <dig> influenza pandemic  <cit> . because of the high mutation rates of the viral genome, vaccines and drugs initially directed against the virus often become ineffective  <cit> . therefore, measures are urgently needed to prevent and treat influenza virus infections, especially for high-risk groups and in the event of another pandemic. certain host cell factors involved in the viral infection cycle have attracted interest as therapeutic targets because these are crucial for viral infections. targeting these factors might inhibit infection, and there is the added advantage that they are less prone to mutations  <cit> .

sialic acid  molecules, found at the non-reducing terminal position of glycoproteins or glycolipids on the surface of cells, are binding targets for influenza a virus  hemagglutinin   <cit> . the has of human iavs preferentially bind to α- <dig>  linked sa, which is abundantly expressed in the human respiratory tract. the ha proteins of avian iavs prefer α- <dig>  linked sa as a receptor, as it is predominant in the avian enteric tract  <cit> . the binding of ha to its appropriate receptor is crucial for the initiation of infection and therefore serves as a potential therapeutic target. the novel sialidase fusion protein, das <dig> , enzymatically removes sas from the respiratory epithelium and exhibits potent antiviral activity against influenza a and b viruses  <cit> . sialyltransferases are key enzymes that regulate the biosynthesis of sialylated oligosaccharide sequences  <cit> . weinstein et al. concluded that one enzyme, βgalactoside α <dig> sialyltransferase i , encoded by st6gal <dig>  was responsible for the addition of α- <dig>  sas to the galβ1-4glcnac disaccharide found on the glycans of n-linked and some o-linked glycoproteins  <cit> . lin et al. found that antisense-oligodeoxynucleotides targeting st6gal <dig> mrnas could inhibit the enzymatic activity of st6gal i, and reduced  <dig> -sialylation at the cell surface  <cit> .

numerous studies involving small interfering rnas  in the treatment of viral infections have been conducted  <cit> , including our successful application of sirnas to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome -infected rhesus macaques  <cit> . qe et al. used sirnas specific for conserved regions of the influenza virus genome; these proved to be potent inhibitors of influenza virus replication in vitro and in vivo <cit> . however, sirnas solely targeting the genes of influenza viruses are unlikely to be sufficient in eliminating infection because there is a high possibility of generating resistant mutants. therefore sirnas targeting host cellular determinants crucial for viral entry and/or replication could be a more efficacious antiviral therapy.

our study was designed to evaluate sirnas targeting st6gal <dig> in airway epithelial cells. we designed four sirna duplexes and screened their ability to down-regulate st6gal <dig> expression and affect the biosynthesis of α- <dig> -linked sa in human respiratory tract epithelium. the antiviral effects of selected sirna duplexes were demonstrated using viral binding assays, and by determining cytoplasmic viral genome copy numbers and virus titers in culture supernatants.

RESULTS
st6gal Ι expression in sirna-transfected a <dig>  hbe, and hep- <dig> respiratory epithelial cells
using qpcr assays, we determined there was an 80–90% reduction in st6gal <dig> mrna expression levels up to 48 h post-transfection . both st6gal1-sirna <dig> and − <dig> were more potent than the other sirna candidates. their effects were verified using western blot assays. in cells transfected with the selected st6gal <dig> sirnas, st6gal Ι expression was substantially lower than in those transfected with control sirnas and untransfected cells . this roughly corresponds to the reduction in mrna levels as observed by qpcr.

transduced epithelial cells showed normal levels of viability
the concentration of st6gal <dig> sirnas we used  did not adversely affect the number of viable cells, nor affect cell morphology  of a <dig>  hbe, and hep- <dig> cells . when we used sirnas at  <dig> nm some cytotoxicity was observed. based on these results, we used sirnas at  <dig> nm in the remainder of our experiments.

down-regulation of influenza virus receptors saα <dig> gal
expression of saα <dig> gal receptors was observed on the surface of cultured human a <dig> cells . treatment with st6gal <dig> sirnas significantly reduced the number of saα <dig> gal receptors at the cell surface  compared with control sirnas  and untransfected cells . similar results were seen for hbe and hep- <dig> cells . our facs analysis of a <dig> cells revealed that st6gal <dig> sirna-transduced cells had an 89% decrease in saα <dig> gal expression. cells treated with control sirnas and untreated cells displayed normal levels of saα <dig> gal expression .

receptor specificity of viruses
all virus strains tested bound to crbcs, which expressed both α <dig> - and α <dig> -linked sa. the h9n <dig> virus preferentially bound to saα <dig> gal-resialylated crbcs, whereas the human h1n <dig> and seasonal human h3n <dig> influenza virus preferentially bound to the saα <dig> gal-resialylated crbcs .

sirna-transduced respiratory cells were resistant to viral challenge
a reduction in viral yield was seen in st6gal <dig> sirna-transduced a <dig> cells challenged with the h3n <dig> and pdmh1n <dig> strains as compared with control cells . similar results were observed for hbe and hep- <dig> cells . no differences were observed when cells were infected with the avian h9n <dig> virus .

inhibition of st6gal <dig> expression affects virus binding and internalization
virus particles were abundant on the surface of a <dig> cells transfected with control sirnas, and those infected with viruses . however, there was a reduction in the number of bound virus particles for cells treated with st6gal <dig> sirnas . the genome copy number of viruses was reduced following transfection of the various cell lines  with st6gal <dig> sirnas  prior to viral infection.

the tested sirnas did not induce an interferon response
the expression of ifn-β in supernatants of sirna-transfected cell lines  was not detected. as a positive control, a long double-stranded rna that is known to induce the expression of ifn-β was included .

discussion
in our study, we were able to demonstrate that down-regulation of the major influenza receptor, saα <dig> gal, in respiratory epithelial cells was a promising approach to prevent viral entry and establishment of an infection. most human influenza infections are caused by virus strains transmitted via an airborne route from the human respiratory tract, although there are some reports of avian influenza viruses directly infecting humans  <cit> . we designed sirnas targeting st6gal <dig>  in an attempt to inhibit pdmh1n <dig> and h3n <dig> virus infection in hep- <dig>  hbe, and a <dig> cells, which are representative of the upper, middle and lower respiratory tract epithelial cells, respectively, without inducing an interferon response.

treatment with sirnas is not dependent upon a functional immune system. therefore sirna therapies could be as effective in elderly or immunocompromised individuals as in immunocompetent individuals  <cit> . the sirnas targeting st6gal <dig> that we used in this current study could be ideal in preventing influenza infection in patient groups with low immunity. our results pertaining to virus binding indicate that st6gal1-specific sirnas reduce the number of iav virions that attach to epithelial cells, because of reduced expression of saα  <dig> gal on the cell surface.

recent studies have suggested that some sirnas could have side effects  <cit>  that adversely affect cell viability. we demonstrated that the effective dose  of sirnas, under the conditions tested, was not toxic to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. however, we did notice that expression levels of receptors were substantially diminished as a result of sirna targeting. influenza viruses naturally infect epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract and the lungs of humans. thus, sirnas can be administered by inhalation. this would result in much higher local sirna concentrations than could be achieved by parenteral injection, without adversely affecting epithelial cells  <cit> . studies focusing on these aspects are currently underway in our laboratories.

in other studies, investigators found that human influenza viruses can still infect st6gal <dig> knock-out mice, achieving similar titers in the lung and trachea as compared with wild-type animals  <cit> . a possible explanation for this is that there was greater efficiency of infection as a result of a deficient systemic influenza-specific humoral response in these st6gal <dig> knock-out mice  <cit> . there are two major types of saα <dig> gal, which differ in their penultimate bond  and these are synthesized by different enzymes  <cit> . some human influenza virus strains propagated in allantoic cavities are able to bind to both saα <dig> gal and saα <dig> gal  <cit> . when recombinant rat α <dig> -sialyltransferase was used to reconstitute sialic acids, only one type of galactose was linked to other glycans through β- <dig>  but not β- <dig>  linkages  <cit> ; however, it is possible that other strains maintain the ability to bind to neu5acα2-3galβ1-4glcnac. thus, saα <dig> gal  present in these mice can compensate for the loss of saα <dig> gal  <cit> . monteerarat et al. <cit>  reported that suppression of saα <dig> gal expression by sirnas against another sialyltransferase, β-galactoside α- <dig> -sialyltransferase  <dig>  could inhibit h5n <dig> avian influenza virus infection. the findings from our current study support the conclusions of monteerarat et al., and we have further extended these to airway epithelial targets of human iav infection. a combination of these two types of sirnas might result in broader spectrum synergistic activities, depending upon their targets.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated the in vitro efficacy of sirnas targeting st6gal <dig> in respiratory epithelial cells for the prevention of iav infections at the virus entry stage. further in vivo preclinical testing is required to determine the suitability of these sirnas for use in humans.
