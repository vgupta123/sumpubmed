BACKGROUND
histone modifying enzymes are key catalytic components of the transcriptional control systems that programme multicellular development. many different histone modifying enzymes contribute to the dynamic regulation of chromatin structure and function, with concomitant impacts on gene transcription. for example, the balance of histone acetyltransferase  and histone deacetylase  activities that are associated with any given gene determines the distribution of histone acetylation marks in the chromatin domain encompassing that gene. histone acetylation is a hallmark of transcriptionally active chromatin, whereas transcriptionally silent chromatin lacks this modification  <cit> . mechanistic analysis of protein complexes that establish and maintain transcriptional repression has revealed the presence of hdacs in these complexes  <cit> . whilst there is much evidence in support of functions for hdacs in transcription silencing, the roles of hdacs in facilitating transcription have been less well appreciated. nevertheless, some genome-wide studies in yeast have demonstrated that hdacs are associated with transcriptionally active genes and that they promote gene transcription  <cit> . more recently, mammalian hdacs have been shown to be specifically enriched in chromatin encompassing the transcriptional start sites of transcriptionally active genes, as well as at transcriptionally silent genes that are poised for activation  <cit> . moreover, hdac-containing protein complexes such as rest/corest have been demonstrated to poise transcriptionally silent genes in a specific configuration in neural progenitors, which facilitates their robust transcriptional activation when these cells are induced to differentiate into neurons  <cit> .

in zebrafish, the class i hdac, hdac <dig>  is required for specification of neurones and glia during embryonic development  <cit> . in addition, prominent roles are known for this gene in the development of the gastrointestinal system and neural crest derivatives  <cit> . in the mouse, there are two murine orthologues of zebrafish hdac <dig>  hdac <dig> and hdac <dig>  which together promote the transformation of embryonic neural progenitors into neurones and glia  <cit> . in both zebrafish and mouse, hdac <dig> regulates neural progenitor differentiation by facilitating the integration of hedgehog, notch and wnt signalling pathway activities into the mechanisms governing neuronal and glial specification. however, precisely how hdac <dig> accomplishes this role is still not well understood.

the establishment of proneural gene expression patterns in early embryonic ectoderm delineates zones of active neurogenesis within the neural plate . proneural gene expression is repressed by the notch pathway as a result of negative feedback from delta-expressing neuronal precursors, which activates notch in proliferating neural progenitors, thus limiting the rate at which these cells are transformed into neuronal precursors . whilst this negative feedback mechanism has been well-characterised, the mechanisms that positively regulate expansion and diversification of differentiated cell types within the nervous system are less well understood. our previous studies demonstrated that hdac <dig> promotes expression of proneural genes, represses notch target gene expression and enables neural fate-determining responses to hedgehog pathway activity  <cit> . in view of the well-documented roles of hdacs as components of transcriptional repressor complexes, these observations suggested a role for hdac <dig> as a potential direct repressor of her <dig> transcription, and thus as an indirect activator of proneural genes. here, we describe the results of our recent work to elucidate further the role of hdac <dig> in neurogenesis, using global gene expression profiling tools to define the hdac1-regulated transcriptome in an unbiased way and to identify direct targets of hdac <dig> using chromatin immunoprecipitation.

RESULTS
identification of hdac1-regulated genes by transcriptome analysis of hdac <dig> mutant zebrafish embryos
previous studies of the hdac <dig> mutant embryonic cns revealed extensive defects of neuronal specification and patterning, along with an absence of differentiated oligodendrocytes  <cit> . when the levels of hdac <dig> protein, histone acetylation and histone methylation were compared in hdac <dig> mutant and wild-type sibling embryos between  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf, hdac <dig> mutants exhibited consistently reduced levels of hdac <dig> protein, together with a large, persistent increase in global histone acetylation and a stable reduction in h3k <dig> methylation, in comparison to wild-type siblings . by contrast, levels of h3k <dig> methylation were mostly unaffected by loss of hdac <dig> function. the major differences in the abundance of acetylated histones and methylated h3k <dig>  that were detected between hdac <dig> mutant and wild-type sibling embryos, demonstrated that hdac <dig> plays a key role in the epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure, and implied that there would be major impacts of hdac <dig> function on transcriptome composition. therefore, to develop a systems-level understanding of hdac <dig> function during embryonic development, we used a global gene expression profiling platform to identify the hdac1-regulated transcriptome in developing zebrafish embryos. by defining temporal changes in the composition of the hdac1-regulated transcriptome from the beginning of neurogenesis onwards, we sought to identify genes whose normal transcript levels exhibited a continuous dependence on hdac <dig> function throughout neurogenesis, and which could thus be important direct effectors of hdac <dig> function in the developing cns.

as a starting point,  <dig> hpf hdac <dig> mutant and wild-type sibling embryos were sorted into morphologically distinct groups. rna was extracted from sorted embryos, labelled and hybridised to agilent arrays comprising  <dig> oligonucleotide probes, which corresponded to  <dig> unique unigene clusters and approximately  <dig> additional ensembl-annotated genes  <cit> . using a p-value threshold of <10- <dig> to define statistically significant expression differences between hdac <dig> mutant and wild-type sibling samples, we observed that  <dig> probes exhibited increased expression in the  <dig> hpf hdac <dig> mutant samples, whereas  <dig> probes exhibited decreased expression in these samples .  <dig> of these hdac1-regulated probes exhibited a 2-fold or greater increase or decrease in transcript abundance as a result of the hdac <dig> mutation.

hdac1-targeted morpholinos closely phenocopy the transcriptional defects exhibited by hdac <dig> mutant embryos
comparison of hdac <dig> mutant and wild-type transcriptomes at  <dig> hpf identified large numbers of hdac1-regulated genes, many of which were likely to be indirect, downstream effectors of the primary target genes for hdac <dig>  to identify candidate hdac <dig> direct target genes, we sought to identify genes whose expression was regulated by hdac <dig> during early developmental stages that preceded the emergence of a morphologically recognisable hdac <dig> mutant phenotype. since morpholinos can be used to create defined batches of embryos that are all deficient in a specific gene function, we compared the phenotypes of embryos microinjected with a translation-blocking morpholino, hdac1atg <dig>  <cit>  or a splice-blocking morpholino hdac1spl <dig>  with the phenotype of hdac <dig> mutant embryos. microinjection of either hdac1atg <dig> or hdac1spl <dig> morpholinos into embryos caused morphological abnormalities that closely resembled the hdac <dig> mutant phenotype , and which were first detectable at ~ <dig> hpf. moreover, both the hdac1atg <dig> and hdac1spl <dig> morpholinos significantly reduced hdac <dig> protein levels in the embryo, although the hdac1atg <dig> morpholino induced a larger reduction in hdac <dig> protein levels than did the hdac1spl <dig> morpholino . by contrast, neither an hdac <dig> mismatch control morpholino , nor a standard control morpholino, exhibited any appreciable effect on embryo morphology, or on levels of hdac <dig> protein .

in order to begin to elucidate the effects of hdac1atg <dig> and hdac1spl1morpholinos on embryonic transcription, the transcriptomes of these morphant embryos were analysed at  <dig> hpf. both the hdac1atg <dig> and hdac1spl <dig> morpholinos elicited major effects on the embryonic transcriptome . a set of  <dig> probes was identified, from within the group of probes whose expression is affected in the hdac1mutant, that also exhibited statistically significant  hdac1-regulated gene expression in  <dig> hpf morphant samples. this set of  <dig> probes was further analysed with the explore gene ontology  software, to identify gene ontology  categories that were significantly enriched in the hdac1-regulated probe set . the biological process category was found to be considerably over-represented in the annotations of hdac1-regulated genes, within which the sub-categories of go terms related to transcriptional regulation  or developmental processes occurred particularly frequently. other prominent go terms that are enriched in the hdac1-regulated probe set include nervous system development, neuronal differentiation and photoreceptor differentiation . thus, both hdac <dig> mutant and morphant transcriptomes exhibit similar alterations to the expression of genes that encode transcription factors and developmental regulators, with an emphasis on development of the nervous system. these results implied that hdac <dig> performs a central role in regulating expression of these classes of genes and further validated the morpholinos as tools for perturbing hdac <dig> function during nervous system development.

in order to determine which of the two hdac <dig> morpholinos most closely phenocopied the hdac <dig> mutation, hierarchical cluster analysis  <cit>  was used to order the transcriptome datasets obtained from  <dig> hpf hdac <dig> mutant, hdac1atg <dig> and hdac1spl <dig> morphant embryos, according to the similarities in the patterns of gene expression changes observed in each of the three different manipulations . this analysis showed that overall, the set of hdac1-regulated genes that was identified using the hdac1atg <dig> morpholino, more closely resembled the group of genes identified by analysis of  <dig> hpf hdac <dig> mutant embryos than did those identified using the hdac1spl <dig> morpholino. the hdac1atg <dig> morpholino was therefore chosen to investigate hdac <dig> function during early stages of cns development before a morphologically distinct phenotype can be recognised. as a first step in this analysis, we determined whether this morpholino could reduce hdac <dig> protein levels from early stages of cns development onwards. hdac1atg <dig> morphant embryos and individually genotyped wild-type and hdac <dig> mutant embryos, aged  <dig> hpf,  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf  were immunostained with an anti-hdac <dig> antibody and analysed by confocal imaging . whilst hdac <dig> protein was abundant in all cell nuclei of wild-type embryos at each of the stages analysed, both hdac <dig> mutant and hdac1atg <dig> morphant embryos exhibited a substantially lower level of hdac <dig> protein, which was more pronounced at later developmental stages . the results of the transcriptomic analysis, together with the experiments to compare the distribution of hdac <dig> protein in hdac <dig> mutant and morphant embryos, revealed a close correspondence between the  <dig> hpf hdac <dig> mutant and morphant phenotypes and validated the hdac1atg <dig> morpholino as a precision tool with which to investigate hdac <dig> function in the embryo between  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf.

hdac <dig> promotes expression of a core set of neurogenic regulatory genes throughout the developing cns
to identify genes whose expression was regulated by hdac <dig> during early stages of neurogenesis, pools of embryos were prepared that were injected with either the hdac1atg <dig> morpholino or the standard control morpholino, and samples were collected at  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf for rna extraction and analysis. at  <dig> hpf, neurogenesis has just begun, by  <dig> hpf it is well underway, and by  <dig> hpf this process is widespread throughout the nervous system. transcriptomes were analysed and the hdac1-regulated gene datasets were compared to those obtained from analysis of  <dig> hpf hdac1atg <dig> morphants . the results of this cluster analysis revealed that considerably more differential gene expression was detectable between the transcriptomes of hdac1atg <dig> and standard control morphant embryos at  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf, than was detectable at  <dig> hpf, even though there are no appreciable morphological abnormalities in hdac1atg <dig> morphant embryos before  <dig> hpf.

the cluster analysis identified several discrete gene classes with temporally distinct, differential expression profiles in hdac1atg <dig> and control morphant embryos, including a small subset of genes that exhibited consistent, statistically significant transcriptional sensitivity to loss of hdac <dig> at all three stages analysed . thus, in hdac1atg <dig> morphant embryos,  <dig> probes were up-regulated at  <dig> hpf,  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf, whereas  <dig> probes were down-regulated at all three time points, in comparison to their expression levels in standard control morphants. in order to identify the genes exhibiting the greatest degree of sustained, differential gene expression at all three time points, probes exhibiting a >2-fold change in expression level at all three time points were selected.  <dig> of these probes exhibited a >2-fold change in expression in hdac1atg <dig> morphants at all three time points analysed . however, in view of the fact that morpholinos can sometimes elicit off-target effects that are not recapitulated by a corresponding mutant, we applied an additional exclusion criterion to eliminate probes that exhibited less than a  <dig> -fold change in expression  in  <dig> hpf hdac <dig> mutants, as compared to wild-type embryos . applying this criterion removed  <dig> of the  <dig> probes that exhibited differential expression in hdac1atg <dig> and standard control morphants, thus reducing the number of probes in this group to  <dig>  of these hdac1-regulated probes,  <dig> exhibited decreased transcript abundance in hdac <dig> mutant and hdac1atg <dig> morphant embryos at each of the time points analysed, whereas  <dig> of the  <dig> probes exhibited consistent increases in transcript abundance . the  <dig> down-regulated probes correspond to  <dig> distinct down-regulated genes, of which  <dig> are specifically expressed in the cns or have a known cns-oriented function. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> encode transcription factors with known or likely roles in programming of cns development: dbx <dig>  bhlhe <dig>  neurod <dig>  ascl1a, ascl1b, crx, gsx <dig>  foxn <dig>  lbx1b, pou <dig>  rx <dig>  fezf <dig>  neurod, mab21l <dig>  hoxb6b, lhx <dig>  hoxa3a, and nr4a <dig>  in addition, the dlb gene, encoding the nervous system-specific notch ligand, deltab, is another robustly hdac1-dependent gene. other genes implicated in cns development that were down-regulated in hdac1-deficient embryos include genes encoding the retinoic acid-metabolising enzyme cyp26b <dig>  gfap, fads <dig> and atp1a1a. <dig>  the two genes exhibiting the greatest fold reduction in transcript abundance in hdac1atg <dig> morphants across the three time points analysed are nsun <dig>  which encodes a protein of unknown, potentially nuclearly-localised function, with a putative methyltransferase-encoding nol1/nop2/sun domain, and a novel gene with no significant sequence similarity to known genes . of the  <dig> up-regulated probes,  <dig> are specifically expressed in the cns or have a known cns-oriented function, such as trim <dig> and fjx <dig>  but none encode known transcription factors. taken together, these results demonstrate that hdac <dig> promotes the co-ordinated expression of a core set of neurogenic transcriptional regulators, which we define here as the hdac <dig> neurogenic programme, from early stages of neurogenesis onwards. these results are fully consistent with the gene ontology analysis of the hdac <dig> mutant , which identified genes involved in transcriptional control and developmental mechanisms, including nervous system development, as the principal targets of hdac1-mediated transcriptional regulation.

to document the spatial extent of hdac <dig> function in the neural plate during neurogenesis, the expression patterns of a subset of components of the hdac <dig> neurogenic programme, neurod <dig>  ascl1b, neurod, lhx <dig> and dlb, were characterised by whole-mount in situ hybridisation of  <dig> somite-stage  and  <dig> hpf hdac1atg <dig> morphant and control morphant embryos . we observed that hdac1atg <dig> morphants exhibited considerably reduced expression of these genes throughout the developing cns at both  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf. coinjection of a p53-targeted morpholino, which eliminates off-target effects caused by morpholino injection, had no observable effects on any of the gene expression patterns analysed . by contrast, the expression pattern of sox <dig>  which is expressed widely in the developing nervous system, was unaffected by loss of hdac <dig> function at  <dig> hpf . consistent with the observations in hdac1atg <dig> morphant embryos, the expression pattern of ascl1b was also appreciably reduced in individually genotyped hdac <dig> mutant embryos at  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf, in comparison to its expression level in wild-type sibling embryos . when the expression patterns of neurod <dig>  ascl1b, neurod, lhx <dig> and dlb were then compared in  <dig> hpf hdac <dig> mutant embryos, expression of all five genes was dramatically reduced throughout the cns, as was observed in  <dig> hpf hdac1atg <dig> morphant embryos . taken together, these results suggest that, from early stages of neurogenesis onwards, hdac <dig> promotes the co-ordinated transcription of developmental regulatory genes, at the core of which lies a set of transcription factors that play key roles in regulating neuronal specification and patterning throughout the cns.

previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that hdac <dig> antagonises notch signalling and attenuates expression of the notch target gene her <dig> during cns development  <cit> . moreover, the time-resolved microarray analysis confirmed that statistically significant increases in her <dig> expression could be detected in hdac <dig> mutants and hdac1atg <dig> morphants at  <dig> hpf, but by contrast, statistically significant changes in her <dig> expression were not detected in  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf hdac <dig> morphant embryos, which excluded it from the group of robustly hdac1-regulated genes defined by the microarray analysis . however, when her <dig> expression was analysed by in situ hybridisation, increased expression was observed in the caudal hindbrain and developing optic vesicles of  <dig> hpf hdac1atg <dig> morphants, and the increased her <dig> expression persisted in the morphant hindbrain at  <dig> hpf . thus, although these changes were too small to be reliably detected by the whole-embryo microarray analysis, our in situ data show that in discrete regions of the cns, hdac <dig> represses her <dig> transcription from early stages of neurogenesis onwards, which is consistent with previous observations in older embryos  <cit> .

pharmacological inhibition of hdac function during early neurogenesis closely phenocopies the hdac1atg <dig> morphant phenotype
to determine whether hdac activity is required for correct expression of hdac1-regulated genes specifically during early neurogenesis, wild-type embryos were incubated with the hdac inhibitor trichostatin a  between  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf, then fixed and analysed for gene expression by in situ hybridisation. these experiments revealed that expression of neurod <dig>  ascl1b, neurod, dlb and lhx <dig> in the embryonic cns was almost completely extinguished after incubation in tsa for  <dig> hours . moreover, tsa treatment of embryos from 10- <dig> hpf caused increased expression of her <dig> in the caudal hindbrain and optic vesicles, as was observed in  <dig> hpf hdac1atg <dig> morphants . thus, we conclude that hdacs promote transcription of neurod <dig>  ascl1b, neurod, dlb and lhx <dig> throughout the cns, and attenuate expression of her <dig> in the hindbrain and optic vesicles, during early stages of neurogenesis. in view of the fact that all of these genes are specifically regulated by hdac <dig>  it seems likely that the effects of tsa during early neurogenesis are mediated via direct inhibition of hdac <dig> 

hdac <dig> binds directly to the promoter of the proneural gene ascl1b in  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf zebrafish embryos
genome-wide studies of hdac binding in mammalian t cells have revealed a strong, discrete peak of hdac <dig> binding within the chromatin encompassing the transcription start site of many transcriptionally active genes as well as a smaller number of inactive genes, suggesting a direct role for this chromatin modifying enzyme in local control of chromatin structure at both transcribed and silent target gene promoters  <cit> . the specific enrichment of hdac <dig> at the promoters of active genes enables chromatin structure to be reset for subsequent re-acetylation of histones during transcription elongation  <cit> . our transcriptomic analysis revealed key roles for hdac <dig> in promoting expression of proneural genes and other neural fate-determining factors in the developing cns, as well as in limiting expression of other genes such as her <dig>  within the cns. furthermore, we found that pharmacological inhibition of hdac function caused a rapid shut-down of the neurogenic programme throughout the cns of  <dig> hpf embryos, as well as increasing her <dig> expression in restricted regions of the cns at this stage. we therefore wondered whether hdac <dig> might directly bind to the promoter elements of neural fate-determining genes during neurogenesis, in order to directly regulate their transcription. to investigate this possibility,  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf wild-type embryos were subjected to chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis with the anti-hdac <dig> antibody, which was validated to specifically and efficiently immunoprecipitate hdac <dig> from embryonic chromatin . immunoprecipitated dna samples were then analysed for the presence of specific sequences within the proximal promoter region, the first exon and the first intron of ascl1b, neurod <dig>  deltab and her <dig> . these four genes were chosen for this analysis because their expression patterns in the developing cns were consistently hdac1-regulated between  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf. surprisingly, robust and specific binding of hdac <dig> was detected throughout the region between -785bp and -85bp upstream of the ascl1b transcription start site in both  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf wild-type embryos . in  <dig> hpf embryos, hdac <dig> binding was also detected in chromatin fragments spanning + <dig> bp to +  <dig> bp and + <dig> bp to + <dig> bp downstream of the ascl1b transcription start site. in striking contrast, no specific binding of hdac <dig> to promoter-proximal sequences of neurod <dig>  dlb or her <dig> was detectable. comparative analysis of hdac <dig> binding to the ascl1b promoter region in  <dig> hpf hdac <dig> mutant and wild-type siblings further revealed that all of the statistically significant hdac <dig> binding to the ascl1b promoter, in the region between -785bp and -85bp upstream of the ascl1b transcription start site, was lost in hdac <dig> mutant embryos . our results demonstrate that hdac <dig> specifically binds to a region of the ascl1b promoter between - <dig> and - <dig> bp upstream of the transcription start site and promotes ascl1b expression likely in response to neural signals. these results also indicate that no binding of hdac <dig> to dna sequences close to the corresponding transcription start sites of dlb, neurod <dig> or her <dig>  could be detected.

discussion
hdac <dig> promotes sustained expression of a small subset of developmental regulatory genes from the beginning of neurogenesis onwards
in zebrafish and mouse embryos, hdac <dig> promotes the transformation of neural progenitors into differentiated neurons and glia. the experiments reported here further elucidate the mechanism of hdac <dig> function in zebrafish cns development. we initially sought to identify all of the genes whose expression levels were robustly hdac1-regulated in  <dig> hpf embryos. we found that approximately 20% of all the probes on the microarrays exhibited statistically significant differences in transcript abundance in  <dig> hpf hdac <dig> mutant and wild-type sibling embryos, although only 7% of these hdac1-regulated probes exhibited more than a two-fold change in transcript abundance. however, as this comparative analysis was performed on morphologically distinct  <dig> hpf hdac <dig> mutants and wild-type siblings, it seemed likely that many of the genes identified in this way as being hdac1-regulated are indirect downstream effectors of a smaller programme of gene expression that is directly regulated by hdac <dig> from earlier stages of neurogenesis. therefore, to identify transcriptional changes that were likely to be more direct consequences of loss of hdac <dig> function, we used the hdac1atg <dig> morpholino to generate defined batches of hdac1-deficient embryos, whose transcriptomes were then analysed well before any morphological differences appeared in these embryos. gene ontology analysis of hdac1-regulated genes, in both hdac <dig> mutant and hdac1atg <dig> morphant embryos, revealed a consistent and robust enrichment of genes with known functions in both transcriptional control and cns development. we then discovered within this group a set of  <dig> genes that exhibited consistently increased or decreased changes in transcript abundance in hdac1-deficient embryos at  <dig> hpf,  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf. more than half of these genes are implicated in cns development and down-regulated in hdac1-deficient embryos. within this set of co-regulated genes, we identified a core subset of  <dig> genes encoding sequence-specific dna binding transcription factors, whose down-regulation could readily account for many of the neural specification defects that characterise the hdac1-deficient cns. interestingly, the gene that exhibited the greatest-fold decrease in gene expression in hdac1-deficient embryos encodes a novel member of the methyltransferase-encoding nol1/nop2/sun domain family of proteins, nsun <dig>  but nothing currently is known about the function of this protein.

many of the  <dig> hdac1-regulated cns-specific transcription factor genes that were identified in our experiments play important roles in the specification of neuronal subtype identities in the spinal cord, brain and retina. thus, dbx <dig>  lhx <dig>  lbx1b, gsx <dig>  bhlhe <dig>  ascl1a, ascl1b or their vertebrate orthologues have been implicated in neuronal specification within the spinal cord  <cit> . in the brain, neurod, neurod <dig> and bhlhe <dig> are are required for the production of cortical projection neurones  <cit> , whilst upper motoneurones of the corticospinal tract depend on fezf <dig>  <cit>  and specification of branchiomotor neurones of the mouse hindbrain requires the combined activities of ascl <dig> and neurod <dig> orthologues  <cit> . in the vertebrate retina, formation of amacrine cells is positively regulated by orthologues of ascl1a/b, neurod, neurod <dig>  foxn <dig>  bhlhe <dig> and nr4a <dig>  <cit> . moreover, mammalian photoreceptor specification also requires neurod, crx and rx functions  <cit> . taken together with these observations, our genome-wide expression analysis indicates that hdac <dig> is deployed widely throughout the developing cns to specify a wide variety of neuronal subtypes, by promoting the transcription of this core group of developmental regulatory genes. this conclusion was confirmed by our in situ hybridisation analysis of the expression patterns of proneural/bhlh genes ascl1b, neurod <dig>  and neurod, along with lhx <dig> and the notch ligand gene dlb. transcription of these genes was considerably reduced throughout the hdac1-deficient cns, both at  <dig> hpf and at  <dig> hpf, and transient incubation of embryos in the hdac inhibitor tsa between  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf almost completely extinguished their expression. by contrast, widespread expression of the neural transcription factor gene sox <dig> was not appreciably altered at  <dig> hpf, demonstrating that at this early stage, the reduced expression of ascl1b, neurod <dig>  neurod, dlb and lhx <dig> in hdac1-deficient embryos is not due to reduction in the pool of neural precursors, but rather the result of a failure to specify particular neuronal identities. intriguingly, forced co-expression of the murine proneural gene ascl <dig>  with a small set of neuronal transcription factors in cultured murine fibroblasts, was recently shown to directly re-programme these cells to differentiate into distinct neuronal subtypes  <cit> . remarkably, this group of collaborating murine transcription factors, defined by vierbuchen et al., includes close relatives of brn <dig> , neurod , lhx <dig>  and nr4a <dig> , all of which we have found to exhibit stringent hdac1-dependent co-expression throughout zebrafish neurogenesis. interestingly, the murine ascl <dig> and brn <dig> proteins co-regulate a neurogenic programme by co-operative binding to a conserved dna sequence motif in the cis-regulatory regions of delta genes  <cit> . thus, loss of brn <dig> and ascl1b expression in hdac <dig> mutant cns could be responsible for the reduced expression of dlb that was also observed in hdac <dig> mutant zebrafish embryos. overall, our analysis has uncovered a group of co-regulated neurogenic transcription factors that may function as a regulatory network driving neuronal patterning and differentiation in the cns. it will now be of interest to investigate whether expressing particular combinations of these transcription factors in hdac <dig> mutant embryos can rescue defects of neuronal specification that are caused by loss of hdac <dig> function.

somewhat surprisingly, relatively few genes were identified in the time-resolved transcriptome analysis whose expression was robustly repressed by hdac <dig> between  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf. overall,  <dig> genes were identified, of mostly unknown functions, which exhibited a consistent, two-fold or greater increase in expression in hdac1-deficient embryos across this period of development. of these genes,  <dig> have been implicated previously in aspects of cns development, raising the possibility that their increased transcription could contribute to the defects of neural development in hdac1-deficient embryos. trim <dig>  for example, encodes a brain-specific e <dig> ubiquitin ligase  <cit>  and fjx <dig> encodes a notch-regulated inhibitor of neuronal dendrite branching that is expressed in both the central and peripheral nervous systems  <cit> . our previous work demonstrated that hdac <dig> repressed the notch target her <dig> at 26hpf and 33hpf  <cit> , but her <dig> was not initially identified as an hdac1-regulated gene in the time-resolved transcriptome analysis because its transcript abundance was not statistically significantly changed in  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf morphant embryos. nevertheless, whole mount in situ hybridisation to hdac1atg <dig> morphant embryos revealed that her <dig> expression was appreciably increased in the hindbrain and optic vesicles at  <dig> hpf, which was confirmed in tsa-treated embryos, and that the increased her <dig> expression in the hindbrain persisted in  <dig> hpf hdac <dig> morphants. thus, we conclude that hdac <dig> attenuates her <dig> expression in restricted regions of the cns from early stages of neurogenesis onwards.

the role of hdac <dig> in promoting transcription of genes required for cns development
a recent microarray-based study of hdac function in the differentiation of mouse retinal explants revealed that transcription of genes involved in promoting photoreceptor specification, such as crx, neurod <dig> and neurod, as well as otx <dig> and nrl was rapidly suppressed within  <dig> hours of administering tsa to retinal explants  <cit> . moreover, attenuation of crx and nrl expression by tsa was independent of a requirement for protein synthesis, implying a direct role for hdac enzymes in promoting the transcription of these genes. we observed a similarly rapid and near complete extinction of ascl1b, neurod <dig>  dlb, neurod and lhx <dig> expression, when  <dig> hpf embryos were incubated in tsa. interestingly, many hdacs, including hdac <dig>  are abundant at the promoters of active genes in mammalian t lymphocytes, and closely associated with both hats and phosphorylated rna polymerase ii in the transcribed regions of these genes  <cit> . in yeast, hdacs biochemically oppose hat functions by removing acetylation marks from chromatin at active genes, which facilitates their hat-mediated re-acetylation in subsequent cycles of re-transcription. accordingly, in yeast hdac mutants, genes that are embedded within hyperacetylated chromatin are transcriptionally impaired  <cit> , and moreover, similar observations have been made in mammalian t-cells  <cit> . thus, it seems possible that some of the hyperacetylated histones we observed in hdac <dig> mutant zebrafish embryos are associated with genes whose transcription has been impaired by loss of hdac <dig> function. the finding that hdac <dig> is stably and specifically associated with sequences within the promoter region and first exon of ascl1b in  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf zebrafish embryos, transcription of which is hdac1-dependent throughout this period, identifies ascl1b as a novel in vivo direct target of hdac <dig>  to our knowledge, this is the first such direct in vivo target to be defined for hdac <dig> in vertebrate embryos. taken together, our results suggest that hdac <dig> could promote transcription of this proneural gene directly, by removing acetyl modifications from transcription unit-associated histones to enable their transcription-coupled re-acetylation, and/or by maintaining the ascl1b promoter in a deacetylated, h3k <dig> methylated, transcriptionally poised state. indeed, the fact that global h3k <dig> methylation levels were unchanged by loss of hdac <dig> function  suggests that hdac <dig> may bind to promoters within h3k <dig> methylated chromatin of zebrafish embryos, thus poising them for activation  <cit> . in view of the fact that our experiments were performed on whole embryos, it is possible that hdac <dig> also binds to the ascl1b promoter in non-neuronal cells, although the significance of such possible interactions is unclear, as no ectopic expression of ascl1b was observed in hdac1-deficient embryos. future studies will aim to identify the dna sequences within the ascl1b promoter, and the cognate dna binding proteins, which recruit hdac <dig> to this target gene, and determine whether these interactions are specific for the neuronal lineage in the developing cns. we also intend to investigate how the distribution of epigenetic modifications across the genome is regulated by hdac <dig> 

our in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation studies detected no interactions between hdac <dig> and the dna sequences immediately upstream and downstream of the transcription start sites of neurod <dig>  neurod, deltab and her <dig>  whilst it is possible that these genes are regulated by hdac <dig> indirectly, it is also conceivable that hdac <dig> binds directly to other cis-regulatory elements that are located further away from the transcription start sites of these genes. another possibility is that the level of hdac <dig> binding to these promoters in vivo may be below the threshold for detection in the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. despite the lack of hdac <dig> binding to her <dig> promoter sequences, this gene remains a candidate direct target for direct repression by hdac <dig>  as hdac <dig> repressed her <dig> expression in restricted regions of the cns from  <dig> hpf onwards. indeed, it remains possible that hdac1-mediated repression of her <dig> facilitates the transcription of proneural genes such as ascl1b independently of the physical interaction between hdac <dig> protein and the ascl1b promoter that we describe here. more extensive studies of hdac <dig> binding to the chromatin in which these and other genes are embedded, and identification of proteins that recruit hdac <dig> to its direct target genes, will allow the hdac1-regulated genes identified by our transcriptome analysis to be evaluated further as candidate direct targets for hdac <dig> binding. this information will help to define better the functional interrelationships between components of the hdac1-regulated genetic network that promotes neurogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that hdac <dig> is an epigenetic regulator that governs the global levels of histone acetylation and h3k <dig> methylation during zebrafish development. using a sensitive, in-depth, time-resolved transcriptome analysis of the in vivo function of hdac <dig> during embryogenesis, we defined a principal requirement for hdac <dig> to positively regulate the co-ordinated expression of  <dig> sequence-specific dna binding transcription factor genes with known roles in neural specification and patterning, including several proneural bhlh genes. chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of candidate hdac <dig> direct target genes in developing zebrafish embryos identified stable and specific binding of hdac <dig> protein to the promoter of the proneural gene ascl1b. although it is possible that this binding of hdac <dig> to ascl1b occurs in non-neuronal cells, our results show that transcription of ascl1b is exquisitely sensitive to loss of hdac <dig> function, implying a role for hdac <dig> in promoting ascl <dig> transcription in the neuronal lineage. taken together, our results suggest that in addition to its well-documented functions in transcriptional repression, hdac <dig> may also facilitate the direct transcriptional activation of target genes during vertebrate embryogenesis. in the developing cns, this role could underpin the transcriptional poising of hdac <dig> target genes encoding neuronal fate determinants, where these genes are silent but competent for transcriptional activation in response to neural specification and patterning signals.
