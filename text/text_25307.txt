BACKGROUND
g protein-coupled receptors  are seven-transmembrane receptor proteins that sense external signals and activate a variety of intercellular pathways. binding of signal molecules causes the activation of the heterotrimeric g protein complex. gpcrs are members of the largest membrane receptor family, and the members of this family are present in almost all the eukaryotes  <cit> . genome annotation efforts identified about  <dig> gpcrs in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> ,  <dig> gpcrs in anopheles gambiae  <cit> , and  <dig> gpcrs in bombyx mori  <cit> . interestingly, a large number of gpcrs belong to olfactory and gustatory receptor classes  <cit> . so far about  <dig> olfactory receptors and  <dig> gustatory receptors were identified in d. melanogaster  <cit> . in the honey bee, apis mellifera, genes coding for  <dig> neuropeptide receptors and  <dig> biogenic amine receptors were identified  <cit> . right after the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum genome sequences published in  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> neurohormone gpcrs were identified from tribolium genome, which includes  <dig> biogenic amine receptors,  <dig> neuropeptide receptors and four protein hormone receptors  <cit> . since most of the identified tribolium gpcrs in the above study belong to class a rhodopsin-like gpcr, a comprehensive annotation is required for a genome-wide functional analysis.

the large number and structural diversity among the members of gpcr gene family made it difficult to systematically study their biological functions. however, their diverse functions, such as the regulation of sense of vision, smell and taste, behavioral and mood regulation, immune system and autonomic nervous system, draw most attention in the pharmaceutical industry  <cit> . about 40% of therapeutic drugs target human gpcrs  <cit> . insect development, reproduction, and various behaviors such as host finding and ecdysis, are also under the control of gpcrs  <cit> . for example, several gpcrs are known to participate in the regulation of insect ecdysis behavior. these include ecdysis triggering hormone receptor , crustacean cardioactive peptide receptor  and bursicon receptor   <cit> . many of these gpcrs belong to biogenic amine and neuropeptide receptor families. relatively few efforts have been made to apply the knowledge of insect gpcrs to the development of novel pest control methods such as the disruption of neuropeptide signaling systems using neuropeptide mimics  <cit> . based on mode of action classification issued by insecticide resistance action committee , there are no commercial synthetic pesticides available that use insect gpcr as targets http://www.irac-online.org. to discover gpcr pesticide targets, we identified  <dig> non-sensory gpcrs using blast search in the genome of the red flour beetle, t. castaneum. thirty-nine of them are newly identified in this study. we then performed a large-scale rnai screen to determine the function of all  <dig> identified t. castaneum gpcrs. rnai for  <dig> gpcrs resulted in more than 30% mortality, including eight gpcrs with more than 90% mortality. knockdown in the expression of the genes coding for these gpcrs severely affected larval growth, wing development and ecdysis. finally, rnai for one of the gpcrs, dopamine- <dig> like receptor , resulted in high lethality of early larval growth suggesting tc <dig> may play an essential role in larval growth and development.

RESULTS
identification of non-sensory gpcr genes in t. castaneum
because olfactory and gustatory receptor families contain large number of receptors and are highly diverse multigene families, we excluded both chemo-sensory gpcrs as well as opsins in this study to reduce the amount of screen work. to identify non-sensory gpcrs in t. castaneum genome, amino acid sequences of known non-sensory gpcrs belonging to four different classes were retrieved from the gpcr database, gpcrdb http://www.gpcr.org/7tm/ <cit>  and used as queries to perform blastp searches against t. castaneum protein database  downloaded from beetlebase http://beetlebase.org/ . about  <dig> putative t. castaneum gpcrs with relative high homology to gpcrs of other species  were selected for the next round of search. ncbi conserved domain search program http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/structure/cdd/cdd.shtml was used to verify the presence of seven transmembrane domains  in all putative gpcrs.  <dig> gpcrs out of  <dig> hits were confirmed and classified into four different families: class a, rhodopsin-like receptor; class b, secretin receptor-like; class c, metabotropic glutamate receptor-like and class d, atypical gpcrs . out of these  <dig> gpcrs,  <dig> of them were previously identified as biogenic amine and neuropeptide gpcrs  <cit> . we have classified them into above four classes based on conserved domain prediction program. the deduced amino acid sequences of the newly identified t. castaneum gpcrs were compared with that of d. melanogaster gpcrs. the closest homologues were identified based on the phylogenetic analysis and sequence homology search .

as shown in table  <dig>  there are  <dig> rhodopsin-like gpcrs,  <dig> secretin receptor-like gpcrs,  <dig> metabotropic glutamate receptor-like gpcrs, and  <dig> atypical gpcrs. in rhodopsin-like gpcr class, there are  <dig> biogenic amine receptors ,  <dig> peptide receptors , four glycoprotein hormone receptors , one purine receptor  were identified in t. castaneum. a comprehensive review on neurohormone gpcrs in t. castaneum by hauser et al  <cit>  is recommended for further reading. recently, grhr-like receptors tc <dig> and tc <dig> had been identified as adipokinetic hormone receptor   <cit>  and akh/corazonin-related peptide  receptor  <cit> , respectively. methuselah receptors belong to class b gpcr and are involved in modulation of life span and stress response in d. melanogaster  <cit> . only three methuselah receptors were identified in t. castaneum compared to  <dig> in d. melanogaster . in class c, three metabotropic gabab receptors  and three metabotropic glutamate receptors  were identified in t. castaneum . the frizzled-like receptor belongs to class d atypical gpcrs. this group of receptors share less sequence conservation with the other gpcr families. in t. castaneum there are three frizzled-like receptor genes , no ortholog for d. melanogaster frizzled  <dig> was found in t. castaneum genome .

data for t. castaneum are from this study and  <cit> . data for b. mori are from  <cit> and d. melanogaster are from  <cit>  with modification.

rnai screen to identify gpcrs involved in larval and pupal development in t. castaneum
to study the role of each gpcr in regulating larval development in t. castaneum, dsrna for  <dig> t. castaneum gpcrs were synthesized and injected into one-day-old final instar larvae. mortality and development defects of dsrna injected insects were recorded every 2- <dig> days until all adults eclosed. escherichia coli male gene that encodes maltose-binding protein has been used as an rnai control in our lab for many years. it has been proved to be a reliable control since injection of dsrna for male gene doesn't affect tribolium larval development, molting, growth and female reproduction. in the first rnai screen, we found that out of  <dig> gpcr rnai, knockdown in the expression of  <dig> gpcrs in class a, five in class b and two in class d caused more than 30% of total mortality . no severe mortality was observed in insects injected with dsrna for class c gpcrs. to confirm this result, we repeated rnai experiment by injecting dsrna targeting identified  <dig> gpcrs. as shown in table  <dig>  we found that most of mortality results are repeatable, although there is some variation in stage-specific mortality. this variation may be due to synchronization issue of final instar larvae that were used for dsrna injection, since it may be critical for some gpcrs to knock down their expression at the early stage of final instar larva. among  <dig> gpcrs tested, there are genes coding for biogenic amine receptor , peptide receptors , and protein hormone receptors . silencing of genes coding for four gpcrs  in class b and two gpcrs  in class d also caused severe mortality .

asterisk indicates that rnai for two gpcrs  were not carried out at the second trial.

we observed that there is a clear stage-specific mortality pattern among different gpcr rnai insects. rnai for five gpcrs results in most lethality occurred during the larval stage , while rnai for  <dig> gpcrs caused relatively more pupal mortality than the larval mortality . this result suggests that each of the identified gpcr may play critical roles at different developmental stages.

four genes were selected to check rnai knockdown efficiency . they are associated with a range of mortality phenotype, e.g. tc <dig> , tc <dig> , tc <dig> , tc <dig> . about 50% or more knockdown efficiency was observed in dsrna injected insects when compared to insects injected with control male dsrna for all four gpcrs tested. we also notice that knockdown efficiency is not reflecting how strong the phenotype is. for example, about 4-fold reduction on tc <dig> transcripts caused by tc <dig> rnai results in  <dig> % total mortality, while 2-fold reduction on tc <dig> transcripts caused by rnai results in 95% total mortality. due to large amount of screen work, we didn't check rnai knockdown efficiency for all gpcrs. therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that the absence of mortality phenotype is due to insufficient silencing of target gpcrs. in our studies where the expression of more than  <dig> genes was knocked down in t. castaneum, the lack of phenotype is rarely due to insufficient silencing  <cit> . rnai works efficiently in t. castaneum and we observed more than 50% of silencing for more than 95% of the genes tested.

eight gpcrs are required for larval and pupal development
the phenotypes caused by silencing genes coding for six gpcrs, tc007490/d2r, tc001872/cirl, tc012521/stan, tc009370/mthl, tc014055/fz and tc005545/smo were further investigated, since rnai for these gpcrs results in more than 90% of total mortality. we recently reported characterization of tc008163/bursicon receptor rnai phenotypes  <cit>  and the study on tc013945/ccapr had been published previously  <cit> . therefore, the roles of tc <dig> and tc <dig> on development are not included in the current study. the majority of insects injected with tc007490/d2r dsrna died during the larval stage and was not able to molt to the pupal stage . only a few larvae injected with tc007490/d2r dsrna were able to reach quiescent stage , suggesting that this gene may play an important role during larval growth and development rather than molting and metamorphosis. in contrast, most of the insects injected with tc001872/cirl dsrna entered the quiescent stage and died during this stage . about 40% of the insects injected tc001872/cirl dsrna were able to molt to the pupal stage and eventually died during the early pupal stage. as shown in figure 2f, the eyes continued to develop and accumulate the ommatidia during the quiescent stage in tc001872/cirl rnai insects, suggesting a premature eye development is triggered by tc001872/cirl silencing.

the majority of insects injected with tc012521/stan dsrna was not able to complete adult eclosion and died during pharate adult stage. the majority of tc012521/stan rnai insects died from early eclosion arrest as their wings were not able to invert to the dorsal side as in control insects . these data suggest that the pupal-adult ecdysis behavior was initiated but not completed in tc012521/stan rnai insects.

interestingly, tc014055/fz rnai caused an arrest in both larval-pupal and pupal-adult ecdysis, suggesting that tc014055/fz may play important roles in the regulation of ecdysis behavior. as shown in figure 2h, a split in the dorsal thoracic region was seen in the pharate pupae from tc014055/fz rnai insects, indicating that larval-pupal ecdysis began, but the shedding of the larval cuticle was not completed. during the pupal-adult ecdysis, the phenotypes of tc014055/fz rnai insects are similar to that of tc012521/stan rnai with the wings still attached to the ventral side of the abdomen. the majority of insects injected with tc005545/smo dsrna died during the early pupal stages without showing any ecdysis defects. however, unlike in the control insects injected with male dsrna , the pupal wings were not fully extended in tc005545/smo rnai insects . insects injected with tc009370/mthl dsrna were arrested at the late phase of larval-pupal and pupal-adult ecdysis. most of the body parts of tc009370/mthl rnai insects were able to escape from the old cuticle, however, the wings were not able to fold properly and the exuviae was still attached to the abdomen .

expression pattern of gpcrs during the larval and pupal stages
real-time qrt-pcr was used to study the stage-specific expression pattern of six identified gpcrs that are involved in larval development and metamorphosis. the mrna levels of tc012521/stan showed two peaks during larval and pupal stages, one small peak at three-day after ecdysis to the final instar larvae stage and one large peak around one-day after ecdysis to the pupal stage . the mrna levels of tc001872/cirl were the highest among seven gpcrs tested and the mrna levels during the pupal stage were higher relative to that in the larval stage . the mrna levels of tc007490/d2r were extremely lower in the middle of final instar larval stage when compared to early and late final instar larval stages. the mrna levels of tc007490/d2r remained high during the pupal stage . the mrna levels of tc014055/fz were the lowest among the  <dig> gpcrs tested . interestingly, tc005545/smo showed higher mrna levels during the larval-pupal transition with a peak at one-day after ecdysis to the pupal stage . the mrna levels of tc009370/mthl were also relatively low and two small peaks were detected at one-day and three-day after ecdysis to the pupal stage . thus, the stage-specific expression pattern of these gpcrs may suggest that they play specific roles in the regulation of larval growth as well as larval-pupal and pupal-adult transition.

discussion
because of their diverse biological functions activated by a wide range of ligands, gpcrs have been the targets for a majority of therapeutic drugs. however, to date, no commercial insecticides have been developed that target insect gpcrs http://www.irac-online.org. our large-scale rnai screen for  <dig> annotated gpcrs in t. castaneum identified  <dig> genes in class a, five genes in class b and two genes in class d whose rnai resulted in more than 30% larvae and pupae mortality, suggesting they may play important roles in larval growth, development and metamorphosis. among these genes, silencing of six of them  caused more than 90% mortality during the final instar larval and pupal stages. a majority of the insects injected with dsrna for tc007490/d2r died as larvae. these data suggest that tc007490/d2r is one of the essential gpcrs for normal larval growth and development. therefore, tc007490/d2r is one of the potential targets for the development of novel pesticides for controlling the red flour beetle and related insect pests.

unlike the dopamine 1-like receptor, d2r transduces second-messenger signaling via inhibitory g proteins , which leads to inhibition of adenylate cyclase and modulation of ion channels  <cit> . d2r rnai flies showed decreased locomotor activity  <cit> . in d. melanogaster, d2r is one of the highly expressed genes in the head and brain http://www.flyatlas.org/ and d2r rnai in a primary neuron culture caused an excessive branching phenotype , suggesting its important role in early neuronal development and central nerve system function. since tc007490/d2r rnai beetles died during the larval stage, tc007490/d2r might be playing a critical role in the growth and development of larvae perhaps by modulating neuronal development and locomotor activity as reported in d. melanogaster. however, further research is needed to determine the precise mechanism of tc007490/d2r function in the regulation of growth and development of t. castaneum larvae. the biological function for cirl, the other gpcr identified in our rnai screen as that required for larval growth and development, is not known. however, in vertebrates this receptor is activated by a neurotoxin found in the venom of the black widow spider  <cit> . tc001872/cirl could be another interesting target for development of novel pesticides.

in contrast to tc007490/d2r rnai, three other gpcr rnai results significant pupal lethality, rather than larval lethality. they are tc008163/bursicon receptor, tc006805/ccha2r and tc003150/snpf-r. recently, the role of bursicon receptor  in larval development was identified in d. melanogaster  <cit> . when d. melanogaster rk expression was down-regulated by transgenic rnai, the majority of progeny died at pupal stage. similar to our previous study  <cit> , rk expression is required in developing epidermal tissue and imaginal discs in d. melanogaster  <cit> . early this year, two drosophila gpcrs code for novel receptors for cchamide- <dig> and - <dig> were deorphanized  <cit> . in b. mori, one of the cchamide receptor genes is expressed in central nervous system and gut, however, the biological function for this neuropeptide receptor is unknown  <cit> . in the present study, we found knockdown of one of the putative cchamide receptors  in t. castaneum results in relative high mortality in pupal stage, indicating that this novel neuropeptide receptor may play a role during the metamorphosis. further studies are needed to investigate the specific function of the cchamide receptor during larval or pupal development. in drosophila, short neuropeptide f  and its receptor snpfr <dig> regulate expression of insulin-like peptide in brain ipc neurons  <cit> . therefore the biological function of snpf has been linked to growth, metabolism and aging. although we didn't find a huge mortality by knocking down tc003150/snpf-r, rnai for tc <dig> caused higher pupal lethality than larval lethality, suggesting its critical role in pupal development, probably imaginal disc growth.

among eight gpcr rnai that result severe mortality, insects injected with tcccapr <dig> dsrna were not able to complete adult eclosion and died during the pharate adult stage. our data showed that the pupal-adult ecdysis behavior was initiated but not completed in tcccapr <dig> rnai insects. in d. melanogaster, ccap-cell ablation resulted in deficiencies in both pupal and adult ecdysis  <cit> . similarly, a recent study on ccap and its receptors in t. castaneum showed that ccap and ccapr <dig> rnai caused the ecdysis deficiency associated with weak reverse-bending, wing air-filling and anterior-posterior  contractions  <cit> . in addition, tc012521/stan, a cadherin-related gpcr involved in tissue polarity, was also found to play a role in pupal-adult ecdysis. the d. melanogaster tissue polarity gene stan  possesses a huge protocadherin domain containing nine cadherin motifs, four egf-like motifs, and two laminin g motifs. flies with stan mutant in the wing show cell autonomous wing hair polarity defects  <cit> , while stan mutant in the eye show the tissue polarity defects in the ommatidia  <cit> . the dependence of proper stan localization on frizzled  activity suggests that stan functions downstream of fz in controlling planar polarity  <cit> . interestingly, rnai for frizzled in t. castaneum caused the arrest in both larval-pupal and pupal-adult ecdysis. a split in the dorsal thoracic region was seen in the pharate pupae, indicating larval-pupal ecdysis began but pupae were not able to come out of the larval cuticle. frizzled is a wingless receptor and a tissue polarity gene. in d. melanogaster, frizzled mutants show strong wing-hair disorientation, negligible segment-polarity of homozygous embryos, altered polarity of bristles and hairs on the adult abdomen and thorax  <cit> . silencing of another tissue polarity gene, tc005545/smo, did not result in any arrest of ecdysis, but caused defects in wing expansion. smoothened  is thought to be a component of the hedgehog receptor. smo mutation caused embryonic lethality. in smo mutants, all denticles in abdominal segments point posterior. smo is also required for decapentaplegic  expression in wing discs during the metamorphosis  <cit> . taken together, these data suggest that smo regulates wing development during the postembryonic stages in a conserved manner across insect species. these results also indicate that the tissue polarity-regulating gpcrs play critical roles during molting and metamorphosis in t. castaneum.

interestingly, one of the aging-related gpcrs, tc009370/mthl, was found to be involved in both larval-pupal and pupal-adult ecdysis. the methuselah-like receptors  play an important role in aging and reproduction. mutation of mthl resulted from a p-element insertion in d. melanogaster extended the life span and enhanced the resistance to free radicals and starvation  <cit> . flies homozygous for the mthl mutation showed pre-adult lethality. however, there is no phenotypic data for the methuselah-like  <dig> receptor  mutant fly. in this study, we found that out of three methuselah-like receptors, only tc009370/mthl regulates larval-pupal and pupal-adult ecdysis. this is similar to the pre-adult lethality observed in d. melanogaster mthl mutants.

here we hope to identify gpcrs that could be served as potential pesticide targets, which can be used in small molecule screen, or the development of rnai-based pesticides. among the identified gpcrs, many of them belong to classic gpcrs, e.g. biogenic amine receptors  and neuropeptide receptors . these gpcrs can be used as potential targets for novel pesticide development. on the other hand, it may not be possible to apply small molecule ligands for pest management through targeting identified atypical gpcrs , however, it is possible to develop a rnai-based pest control strategy through ingestion of specific dsrna targeting atypical gpcrs as well as classical gpcrs  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
large-scale rnai screen has been successfully used in dissecting signal transduction networks in vitro  <cit> , or biological processes in vivo  <cit> . in this study, we performed a non-sensory gpcr screen and identified at least six gpcrs that are required for either larval development or ecdysis behavior. our study provides a systematic functional analysis on gpcrs in t. castaneum and increases our understanding on the function of insect gpcr in the regulation of post-embryonic development. in addition the identified gpcr genes could be potential pesticide targets for development of novel insecticides. insecticide resistance has become a serious problem in controlling many insect pests that damage crops and transmit diseases. in africa, the malaria vector, a. gambiae shows increasing levels of resistance to pyrethroid insecticides resulting from knock-down resistance  mutation  <cit>  and overexpressed cytochrome p <dig>  <cit> , which has significant impact on malaria prevention and control. alternative control agents have to be developed to manage populations of insecticide-resistant pest insects. since the gpcr receptor family has been successfully used as targets of many therapeutic drugs, it may be possible to develop pesticides that target gpcrs. the identified gpcrs in our study could be used as targets for development of novel pesticides.
