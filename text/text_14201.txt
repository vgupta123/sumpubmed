BACKGROUND
the neurosecretory system controls a wide variety of behavioural processes through synthesis and release of different neurotransmitters in the peripheral and central nervous systems  <cit> . one of the key integrating centers of this organization is the hypothalamus, located in the ventral sector of the diencephalon. however, insights in the development of endocrine neurons has been gained in the midbrain, due to implications with mental and neurological phenotypes that involve growth, reproduction and general homeostasis, and have clinical relevance in degenerative and psychiatric disorders of embryonic origin   <cit> . a wealth of genetic data shows that the combinatorial codes of early instructional cues from hedgehog , fibroblast growth factor , and transforming growth factor  extracellular signals mediate differentiation of dopaminergic  neurons in the midbrain  <cit> . knowledge of the mechanisms of action connecting the prosencephalic signaling pathways, the expression of specific transcription factors and the specification of neuronal individuality during the development of the hypothalamus remains largely unclear  <cit> .

because of its central contribution to hypothalamic phenotypes during ontogenesis, the homeobox-containing orthopedia  gene may allow a meaningful understanding of signaling cascades  <cit> . homologs of otp have been identified in almost all metazoa, pointing to a conservative and fundamental role in patterning and differentiation  <cit> . in mouse forebrain, otp is expressed in anterior and posteroventral hypothalamus, retrochiasmatic and supraoptic/paraventricular areas  <cit> . otp knock-out mice embryos fail to properly differentiate anterior periventricular, paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, responsible for secretion of somatostatin, arginine vasopressin, oxytocin, corticotropin-releasing hormone and thyrotropin-releasing hormones  <cit> . in the diencephalon, otp acts in parallel with the bhlh-pas domain factor sim <dig> and its dimerizing partner arnt <dig>  and triggers expression of sim <dig> and brn <dig>  a pou domain factor  <cit> . it has been shown that otp is a direct target of brachyury and spdeadringer transcription factors in vertebrates and invertebrates  <cit> . recently, several transcription factors have been proposed as candidates for upstream regulatory interactions with echinoderm otp  <cit> . some cases of holoprosencephaly, a congenital disorder with deficiencies in specific groups of ca neurons, are characterized by disruption of sonic hedgehog  and secondary down-regulation of otp, brn <dig> and sim <dig>  evoking an interaction between otp and shh  <cit> . despite all these evidences, the mechanisms of regulation of the otp gene itself remain largely obscure.

we took advantage of the zebrafish to investigate the in vivo functions of shh, fgf <dig>  and ndr <dig> signaling pathways on otp <dig> expression by means of morpholino-, mrna- and mutant-based methodologies. we provide evidence that shh regulates otp <dig> neuronal differentiation in the rostral preoptic area  , through the antagonistic interaction with fgf and dzip <dig>  a zinc-finger/coiled-coil domain protein  <cit> . moreover, we also demonstrate that shh- and fgf8-independent, ndr2-dependent transcription of otp <dig> in the posterior tuberculum   is necessary to trigger ca neuronal fates. in evolutionary perspectives, functional association between otp <dig> gene expression and patterning of the diencephalon embodies a primitive condition in the rise of neuronal complexity of vertebrates.

RESULTS
isolation and structural analysis of the zebrafish orthopedia genes
to isolate the zebrafish homologue of orthopedia , a 16– <dig> hour old zebrafish embryo cdna library  was used for a pcr-based screening with degenerate primers. primers, named ort1_fw , and ort2_rv , correspond to paqlne and akwkkr regions of the mouse otp homeodomain, respectively. using a semi-nested pcr approach, we isolated a cdna band of  <dig> base pairs  encoding a partial homeodomain identical to the corresponding residues in the mouse otp protein. gene- and vector-specific primers were used on the same library to isolate the 5' and 3' ends of the mrna, allowing the identification of a  <dig> bp  tail excluded) full-length otp <dig> cdna containing a  <dig> bp-long open reading frame . the 5' utr of the mrna is 66-nucleotide  long and the first putative aug codon is located between nt  <dig> and  <dig>  suggesting the 67/ <dig> aug triplet as the initiation codon. therefore, the deduced protein encoded by otp <dig> is  <dig> amino acid  long. the mrna has a uaa stop translation codon at nt  <dig> and a  <dig> nt long 3' utr region, with one polyadenylation signal  located between nucleotides  <dig> and  <dig> 

during the same screening, a shorter otp <dig> transcript was also identified that encodes a  <dig> aa long form of otp <dig>  the two transcripts differ for a 39-nt insertion at 5' end. interestingly, both human and mouse otp genes have an intron at the same position of the zebrafish otp <dig> insertion, suggesting that the two isoforms are generated by alternative splicing. analysis of the zebrafish otp <dig> genomic region flanking the insertion confirmed the presence of an intron  at the same position as in human and mouse otp genes . in zebrafish, an additional donor sites generates a shorter mrna form when a 39-nt fragment at the 3' end of the first exon is spliced out together with the downstream intron . rt-pcr experiments and a cdna library-based pcr screening confirmed the existence of two otp <dig> transcripts during embryo development . genomic analysis of the zebrafish otp <dig> gene, located bioinformatically on chromosome  <dig>  has been confirmed by pcr, revealing an organization similar to mammalian otp homologs. the gene contains two introns of  <dig> and  <dig> bp, with the first one interrupting the n-terminus of the protein, and the second one located at the very end of the homeobox.

otp <dig> mrna is characterized by an au-rich element  of ~ <dig> nt in length, that lies within the 3' utr and is located ~ <dig> bases downstream of the stop codon. this are contains five copies of the auuua sequence, one of which overlaps with the uuauuuauu nonamer, that represent the minimal au-rich motif that is able to destabilize and decay messengers  <cit> .

in silico search of the zebrafish genome using otp <dig> cdna as bait provided a second otp gene, named otp <dig>  located on chromosome  <dig>  otp <dig> orf is  <dig> bp long, corresponding to a putative protein of  <dig> aa. according to mrna sequences submitted to the ncbi database , the otp <dig> rna is alternatively spliced and encodes two discrete forms of mature mrna. genomic organization of otp <dig> is identical to otp <dig>  including presence and position of introns and the additional donor site .

molecular evolution of otp proteins
zebrafish otp <dig> and otp <dig> proteins clearly belong to the otp protein family of transcription factors, and they are likely co-orthologs arisen from the ancient genome duplication event that occurred early in the phylogeny of ray-finned fish  <cit> . the identity of zebrafish otp homeodomains with mus musculus, dugesia japonica and drosophila melanogaster is 100%, 97% and 95%, while full protein identity with mouse is 78% for otp <dig> and 81% for otp <dig>  in addition, they appear to share the otp-specific transactivating regions, as well as two additional domains near the terminator codon  <cit>  . the  <dig> aa stretch resulting from alternative splicing  of otp proteins is characteristic of the fish lineage . in fact, mouse and human otp genes lack the additional donor site in the first intron responsible for the alternative splicing of the long protein form. for this reason, the short form of the zebrafish otp proteins shows higher levels of similarity with mammalian homologs .

for phylogenetic analysis, we used all available otp protein and nucleotide sequences, including four ones that were derived from est and genomic sequence databases . otp protein alignment consisted of  <dig> characters,  <dig> of which were parsimony-informative. zebrafish otp sequences were easily aligned against the rest of the data set mainly within the homeobox domain, including small secondary regions of high similarity. only these regions were used for the sequence analysis, while the most variable fragments were excluded. the maximum parsimony  phylogenetic reconstruction  resulted in  <dig> equally parsimonious trees . maximum likelihood  and bayesian phylogenetic analyses , constrained with the model of protein evolution that fits the data best,   <cit>  were topologically similar to the mp tree. at any phylogenetic reconstruction, the antennapedia homeodomain region diverges greatly from the other gene clusters, occupying a distinct basal position. otp, otd and otx gene families share an elevated sequence and structural homology in their homeodomain region. within the otp gene-family, two sub-clades are highly supported by all phylogenetic reconstruction methods: a vertebrate-specific otp protein cluster, including fish paralogs, and one including mollusca, echinoderma and hemichordata orthologs. a third sub-clade consisting of d. japonica, d. melanogaster, h. magnipapillata, and ciona intestinalis otp gene sequences is not robustly supported in any of the topologies . finally, a otd/otx gene cluster, distantly related and basal to the otp gene family, was observed in all phylogenies inferred.

spatiotemporal expression of otp <dig> during embryogenesis
rt-pcr
we evaluated the presence of the two mrna forms at different stages by means of rt-pcr using a pair of primers spanning the cdna region involved in alternative splicing. both transcripts are already present at the oocyte stage, proving the maternal origin of the transcript, and remain detectable throughout the analyzed stages . we also report the expression of otp <dig> in the adult fish, showing for the first time the activity of the gene in the adult brain and in non-neuroectodermal territories . the rt-pcr approach does not recognize trends or relative differences between mrna forms and developmental stages, supporting the view that splicing of otp <dig> rna is not subject to strict regulatory mechanisms .

hindbrain
the spatial and temporal distribution of otp <dig> transcripts was examined by whole mount in situ hybridization  following standard protocols with digoxigenin and fluorescein-utp-labeled probes  <cit> . although rt-pcr revealed the presence of maternal and zygotic transcripts, first evidence of otp <dig> mrna localization by wish appears in the forming hindbrain around the  <dig> somites  stage, as a transverse stripe in the prospective rhombencephalon . as shown by double labelling with krox <dig>  otp <dig> expression at  <dig> s occurs in rhombomeres  <dig>  and  <dig>  . a histological cross section at the level of the otic placodes shows that rhombencephalic otp <dig> cells are located in the ventral alar plate of the neural tube, within the mantler layer . as somitogenesis proceeds, otp <dig> expression extends rostrally  and then caudally across the hindbrain in the shape of segmentally iterated groups of cells . at  <dig> hours post fertilization , otp <dig> transcripts in the hindbrain extend dorsally as parallel stripes in the middle of each neuromeric segment , possibly acting as guidance cues for axonal elongation . this hypothesis is supported by spatial comparison of otp <dig> mrna with acetylated α-tubulin at  <dig> hpf, a marker of reticulospinal neurons and corresponding axons in the central part of every rhombomere  <cit>  . at  <dig> hpf, otp <dig> expression in the hindbrain still persists in every rhombomere without further modifications .

diencephalon
soon after labelling in the hindbrain, a distinct cluster of otp <dig> transcription appears at the rostral end of the neural tube, in medial position with respect to the optic stalk-specific pax- <dig>  positive cells  <cit>  . shortly after, a novel diencephalic domain emerges posteriorly to the previous one . the foremost, smaller group is located at the boundary with the prospective telencephalon, while the posterior, larger one is observed more laterally, below the optic recess . at  <dig>  hpf, otp <dig> expression in the hypothalamus has gained further spatial complexity, as shown by the evidence of three main clusters . the  <dig> s stage marks the onset of ventral bending of the neural axis at the level of the cephalic flexure, a major morphogenetic process that generates the displacement of forebrain territories at distinct axial levels  <cit> . in this framework, a spatial rearrangement of the hypothalamic otp <dig> expression is observed. apparently, the medial cluster of otp <dig> expression is displaced dorsally and merges with the anterior one . at  <dig> hpf, otp <dig> expression in the hypothalamus is established as two domains, one in the anterior alar plate, at the boundary with the telencephalon , and one in the posterior basal plate of the hypothalamus, in few cells of the posterior tuberculum  extending from the hairpin bend near the cephalic flexure  . at  <dig> hpf, again three domains of otp <dig> mrna distribution are detected in the ventral diencephalon .

at  <dig> hpf, transversal histological sections show that the anterior diencephalic domain belongs to the non-germinal  layer . coupling otp <dig> wish with acetylated α-tubulin immunostaining, a marker of major axonal traits in the embryonic cns, proves that the anterior otp <dig> cluster is enclosed in the preoptic area   by the tracts of the anterior and postoptic commissures, and it extends toward the trait of the supraoptic commissure . due to this dorsal extension in the supraoptic region, we addressed otp <dig> expression at the telencephalic-diencephalic boundary using masterblind  mutants. in mbl embryos, several forebrain defects are observed, such as absence of optic vesicles, olfactory placodes, clusters of primary telencephalic neurons, anterior and postoptic commissures  <cit> . despite profound alterations in the telencephalic structures, no significant changes are detected in the po cluster of otp <dig> expressing cells in comparison with wt embryos at 20-s stage, suggesting that otp <dig> expression does not occur in the telencephalon .

combinatorial regulation of otp <dig> by hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor and nodal signaling
the cyclops  embryos carry mutations in the nodal-related  <dig>  gene that alter the development of ventral cns structures, with a severe phenotype in the rostral brain  <cit> . analysis of otp <dig> expression in  <dig> hpf cyc embryos with intermediate phenotypes  shows a reduced size and midline blending of the po domain. interestingly, no otp <dig> expression occurs in the pt of cyc embryos . to answer whether this result is determined by impaired development of the otp1-expressing cells or by absence of the prosencephalic ventral structures where the otp1-positive neurons normally form, we microinjected ndr <dig> synthetic mrna and analyzed the effects on the expression profile of otp <dig> in the pt area . in accordance with the absence of otp <dig> signal in cyc embryos with intermediate phenotypes, ndr <dig> overexpression induces a moderate expansion of the pt-specific otp <dig> domain  .

fgfs released from the isthmus and other organizing centres are required to pattern the neuroepithelium along its dorsoventral and anteroposterior axes  <cit> . in zebrafish embryo, tissues expressing fgf <dig> are observed in close proximity with the otp <dig> cluster in po . herein, the specification of otp <dig> cells in the po is repressed in  <dig> to 24% of the embryos at  <dig> hpf that overexpress fgf <dig> . the same cluster is expanded in fgf <dig>  mutant embryos at  <dig> hpf . on the contrary, pt-specific otp <dig> expression is not altered in both ace embryos and following fgf <dig> overexpression .

searching for regulative interactions between otp <dig> and hh factors, we first compared expression patterns of shh and patched- <dig> , a shh-specific receptor  <cit> , with otp <dig>  in the prospective diencephalon, otp1-positive cells lie at the ventro-lateral edges of ptc <dig> and shh expression domains, therefore in a region exposed to elevate hh concentrations . effects of synthetic shh mrna injections on otp <dig> expression were analysed at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf of development . the majority of embryos injected with synthetic shh mrna exhibits a disorganized otp <dig> expression pattern in the hypothalamus. interestingly, dorsalization of otp1-positive cells does not extend to the thalamus, except for two peculiar cells . ectopic otp <dig> expression is also observed in the optic vesicle  <cit>  . in the hindbrain of shh-overexpressing embryos, otp <dig> transcripts are still orderly arranged although as a single domain per rhombomere .

then, otp <dig> expression was studied in sonic you  and iguana  mutant embryos, zebrafish strains characterized by functionally null alleles of, respectively, shh  <cit>  and the dzip <dig> gene, a negative regulator of hh signaling gradients  <cit> . in  <dig> hpf syu mutants, the po otp <dig> pattern is drastically reduced in size . on the contrary, loss of dzip <dig> functions in igu embryos induces a phenotype characterized by supernumerary po otp1-positive cells . in both mutants, no obvious alterations of otp <dig> expression are observed in the pt .

direct interactions between fgf and hh signaling were approached by wish analysis of otp <dig> transcripts in ace; syu double mutant embryos, in which po or pt clusters of otp <dig> expression are not significantly altered .

da neuronal progenitors and otp <dig> activity
among populations of ca neurons described in the zebrafish brain during development, the pt hosts distinct groups of da neuroblasts  <cit> . our data support the notion that otp <dig> transcription in the pt is functionally linked with a population of da neurons. double labelling of otp <dig> mrna and th, a marker of ca neurons in the diencephalon, shows that a fraction of the da neurons placed in the pt, adjacent to the ventral flexure, express otp <dig> . moreover, the zebrafish mutant motionless  features a reduction of da neurons in the pt  <cit> . accordingly, the number of otp <dig> positive cells is sharply decreased in this region in mot embryos at  <dig> hpf . finally, inactivation of otp <dig> translation by microinjection of atg-targeted morpholino oligonucleotides at 1– <dig> cell stages causes a marked loss of th-positive cells in the pt .

discussion
orthopedia  expression in vertebrate embryos is crucial for the correct determination of several cell lineages in the neuroendocrine hypothalamus  <cit> . indeed, otp null-mice die soon after birth due to the developmental failure of the anterior periventricular, paraventricular, and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei, and the resultant incapability to secrete important neuro-hormones  <cit> . in zebrafish, a detailed characterization of the ca neurotransmitter pathway makes this organism a favourite model system to address the ontogeny of the vertebrate neurosecretory system  <cit> . to investigate otp regulation in vertebrate development, we have isolated two otp zebrafish homologues  and investigated the in vivo functions of shh, fgf <dig>  and nodal-related  <dig> signaling pathways on otp <dig> expression by means of morpholino-, mrna- and mutant-based methodologies. the conservative structure of the homeodomain region uncovered between the zebrafish otp <dig>  otp <dig> proteins and the rest of our data set indicates clearly that the above proteins represent members of the otp gene family of transcription factors. the percentages of identity between the zebrafish otp homeodomains compared with the ones in mus musculus, dugesia japonica and drosophila melanogaster are found to be variable, reflecting distinct evolutionary relationships as well as functional differences. moreover, each of the antp, otp, and otd/otx gene clusters represent phylogenetically distinct clades characterised by elevated levels of sequence and structural homology. our phylogenetic analysis of otp proteins highly supports a vertebrate group, while it highlights two unorthodox subclades, one consisting of molluscs, echinoderms and hemichordates, and one grouping platyhelminthes, cnidarians and arthropods and tunicates.

otp <dig> gene expression domains are in close proximity to, or within, organizing centres that express signaling factors. in this report, we show that nodal, shh and fgf <dig> independently regulate otp <dig> expression during formation of neural stem cells in the zebrafish forebrain. since results presented herein centred on functional effects occurring within the first  <dig> days of development, th-immunolabeling did not evidence neurons in the po during our assays, therefore impeding to connect otp <dig> activity with ca neurons in the anterodorsal hypothalamus. however, we report the first case of involvement of otp in the determination of a subgroup of ventral hypothalamic ca neurons.

hh and fgf <dig> signaling pathways modulate otp <dig> expression in the hypothalamic preoptic area but not in the posterior tuberculum
hh and fgf <dig> signaling pathways play key roles in the ventral cns patterning  <cit> . our examination of syu, igu, and ace mutants clearly revealed the dependency of otp <dig> expression on shh and fgf <dig> at the level of the otp <dig> positive cluster located in the po, where the two signaling molecules are synthesized. absence of shh protein determines a marked attenuation of the size of the otp <dig> cluster in the po    <cit> . this result suggests that only the prospective otp1-positive cells in the alar plate po have acquired the competence  to respond to the high shh concentration from the ventral neural tube and then trigger otp <dig> expression. this is also supported by the evidence that the po otp <dig> signal increased in igu mutants , which are deficient in shh negative regulation  <cit> . inhibition of the shh pattern via synthetic mrna microinjection causes profound alterations in the spatial organization of the po otp <dig> cluster, but does not induce relevant changes in the number of the otp1-expressing cells, suggesting that otp <dig> responsiveness in the alar plate is dependent on additional positive regulators rather than negative factors hindering shh signal propagation.

interestingly, ectopic otp <dig> expression after shh microinjection was selectively observed in the optic placodes  and in one fixed pair of cells in the roof of the dorsal thalamus , suggestive of a predetermination to respond to the shh signal.

the otp <dig> signal in the po appeared significantly expanded in the ace mutant , indicative of a negative role for this signaling factor in the control of po otp <dig> expression. to confirm this observation we altered the endogenous level of fgf <dig> by synthetic mrna microinjection: excess of fgf concentration reduces the size of the otp1-positive po cluster. as expected from a potential negative regulator, fgf <dig> microinjection does not induce ectopic expression of otp <dig>  no major consequences on otp <dig> expression in the pt are noticed in embryos altered in fgf and shh signalings , supporting the conclusion that fgf <dig> and shh are not required for otp1-based neuronal specification in the posterior diencephalon.

nodal affects otp <dig> expression in the preoptic area and is necessary for otp <dig> activation in the posterior tuberculum, where otp <dig> is required for the correct development of catecholaminergic neurons
the ndr <dig> mutant cyclops  interferes with the nodal pathway causing massive defects in the rostral brain  <cit> . analysis of otp <dig> expression in cyc mutant embryos with intermediate phenotypes  shows midline fusion of po-specific otp <dig> expression; moreover, we noticed that the domain is decreased in size . this phenotype could be in part explained by the partial physical deficiency of the po territory, but also by the repression of shh transcription in cyc mutants  <cit> , such that the reduction of otp1-expressing cells after the disruption of nodal signaling is determined by intrinsic loss of shh  , pointing to the po otp <dig> expression regulation mediated by ndr <dig>  we did not detect any otp1-expressing cells in the pt of nodal  mutant embryos. this phenotype is not caused by shh deficiency since otp <dig> expression in the posterior basal plate of the hypothalamus is not modulated by hh signaling, but could be determined by the absence of the prosencephalic ventral structures. this issue has been addressed overexpressing ndr <dig> and analyzing the effects on otp <dig> transcription in the pt area. increase of ndr <dig> function is shown to determine the expansion of the pt-specific otp <dig> domain , in accordance with the opposite effect in the pt of cyc embryos with intermediate phenotypes. taken together, these results are indicative of nodal signaling as a positive regulator of otp <dig> expression in the posterior basal plate of the hypothalamus. furthermore, holzschuh and colleagues reported the loss of diencephalic da neurons also in mzsur, a nodal mutant in which the pt correctly develops, therefore suggesting the direct involvement of nodal in the differentiation of the da neuron in the posterior tuberculum  <cit> .

in this context, our findings allow to propose that the nodal contribution to the development of the ca neurons in pt might be mediated by otp <dig>  because both otp1- and th-positive neurons occur in the pt, we co-labelled this area. interestingly, otp <dig> and th partially overlap in a small clade of neuronal precursors . in these cells, otp <dig> activation precedes of several hours that of dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase genes  <cit> . in addition, embryos of a zebrafish mutant that displays a reduced number of hypothalamic da neurons   <cit>  show less otp1-positive neurons . the hypothesis of a subset of ca neurons requiring otp <dig> action for their differentiation was finally tested by microinjection of otp1-specific atg-targeted morpholino oligonucleotides in wild type embryos. a mot mutant phenocopy was generated at the pt level, with the repression of th-positive cell differentiation . altogether, these data confirm the otp <dig> gene as one functional milestone towards the correct development of the ca system.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we provide strong circumstantial evidence of regulatory links between otp <dig> expression and nodal, shh and fgf signaling cascades in the hypothalamus. the first piece of evidence demonstrates that nodal, in concert with fgf <dig> and shh, mediates otp <dig> expression in the preoptic area . remarkably, our data indicate a second signaling mechanism in which nodal, but not fgf <dig> and shh, regulate early otp <dig> functions in the determination of ca neurons in the posterior tuberculum . the identification of otp <dig> as a key component in the differentiation of diencephalic ca neurons will help in clarifying the developmental bases of several human behavioural aspects as well as pathologies such as addictions and parkinson's disease.
