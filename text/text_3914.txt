BACKGROUND
salmonella serotypes are estimated to cause  <dig>  million cases, more than  <dig> deaths, and cause severe economic losses which approach from $ <dig>  to  <dig>  billion per year in the united states  <cit> . salmonella enterica serotype enteritidis  emerged during the last three decades, currently ranking 2nd most common serotypes in the united states. furthermore, s. enteritidis is the most common serotype in europe and other parts of the worlds  <cit> .

ecologically, s. enteritidis is a zoonotic pathogen that is harbored by many reservoirs and is transmissible to humans largely through contaminated foods. several epidemiologic studies indicated the important role of eggs and poultry meat as major vehicles in the transmission of the organisms to human consumers  <cit> . s. enteritidis can contaminate eggs through transovarian transmission during egg development in the infected chickens  <cit> .

genetically, s. enteritidis probably originated from an ancestral clone that led to the evolution of several minor clones based on a phylogenetic analyses of a large groups of isolates  <cit> . however, little is known about the molecular relatedness among s. enteritidis isolates from different reservoirs . while some reports described the existence of specific molecular attributes among s. enteritidis associated with outbreak cases, the homogeneity of the s. enteritidis genome renders typing tools such as pfge insufficient for molecular characterization to establish relatedness among isolates from cases and probable sources for infection  <cit> .

pfge and phage typing have been combined to characterize s. enteritidis isolates from different sources  <cit> . although phage typing is still commonly used for the epidemiologic investigation of s. enteritidis infections worldwide, this method has several shortcomings including the occurrence of non-typeable strains and the possible phage conversion among s. enteritidis isolates  <cit> . therefore, more efficient subtyping methods may be needed to relate disease-causing pathogens to their probable sources.

we have recently described an optimized mlva technique using a single multiplex pcr followed by multicolor capillary gel electrophoresis and demonstrated that it has a higher discriminatory power than pfge and phage typing in limited samples  <cit> . in that report, we suggested that mlva subtyping together with pfge would enhance the effectiveness of epidemiologic investigation of s. enteritidis infections. the utility of vntr analysis in characterizing salmonella typhimurium isolates from human, pig, and poultry was reported. the most frequent alleles at each locus were compared and it was concluded that the vntr analysis might be potentially used for source attribution.  <cit> .

in the present report we have updated the mlva system using two panels of multiplex pcr and analyzed larger number of s. enteritidis from different sources, including humans, chickens, and eggs. the objective of this study was to characterize s. enteritidis isolates from human and non-human sources by 1) comparing the allele distribution of vntr loci, 2) comparing genetic diversity of vntr loci, and 3) describing the relationship between vntr profiles and sources of isolates.

RESULTS
distribution of mlva types by phage types among s. enteritidis from different sources
the  <dig> s. enteritidis isolates from different sources included  <dig> different phage types and  <dig> different mlva types . there were  <dig> distinct mlva types identified from human isolates,  <dig> distinct mlva types from chicken isolates,  <dig> from egg isolates, and  <dig> from other sources the most common mlva type among isolates from humans was "a0". it was found in  <dig>  of  <dig> human isolates. mlva type "a9" was the most common  among  <dig> distinct mlva types found in  <dig> chicken isolates. mlva type a <dig> was the most common  among  <dig> different mlva types found in  <dig> egg isolates.

characterization of the most common s. enteritidis phage types including pt <dig> , pt13a , pt <dig> , and pt <dig>  by specific mlva types resulted in the following subgroups: out of  <dig> s. enteritidis isolates belonging to pt <dig>   <dig> isolates  were mlva type "a0"  and <dig> isolates  were mlva type "a4" .

the isolates with type "a0" and pt <dig> were significantly associated with humans  whereas isolates with type "a4" and pt <dig> was significantly associated with egg source .

no significant associations were found between pt13a and specific mlva types. among  <dig> isolates of pt <dig>   <dig> belonged to mlva type "a9", and  <dig> belonged to mlva type "am" . the isolates with type "a9" and pt <dig> were significantly associated with chickens  whereas isolates with type "am" and pt <dig> were significantly associated with eggs. . among  <dig> isolates of pt <dig>   <dig> belonged to mlva type "a6" .

tandem repeats and allele distribution of vntr loci among s. enteritidis isolates from different sources
most of the vntr loci markers had different allele distribution among isolates from human chicken, and egg sources . significant differences in allele frequency at vntr locus se <dig> were found in isolates from chickens and eggs compared to isolates from humans . significant differences in allele distribution were observed at the following vntr loci: locus se <dig> from the isolates , locus se <dig> , locus se <dig> , locus se <dig> , locus se <dig> , and locus se <dig> .

genetic diversity of vntr loci markers among isolates from different sources
the genetic diversity based on nei's index of diversity  for nine vntr loci ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . vntr loci se <dig> and se <dig> were identified to be the most polymorphic loci  while loci se <dig> and se <dig> were less polymorphic with indices of less than  <dig> .

the genetic diversity ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>   for human isolates,  <dig> to  <dig>   for chicken isolates,  <dig> to  <dig>   for egg isolates, and  <dig> to  <dig>   for others . there were significant differences in the means of the diversity values  for seven polymorphic loci between isolates from human and egg sources  and for eight polymorphic loci between isolates from chicken and egg sources  while differences in the means for nine polymorphic loci between human and chicken isolates were not significant .

genetic diversity for each locus was compared between isolates from different sources . diversity for loci se <dig>  se <dig>  se <dig>  se <dig>  and se <dig> was significantly higher in human isolates than in chicken isolates  while the diversity for loci se <dig> and se <dig> was significantly higher in chicken isolates than in human isolates . the genetic diversity values  for loci se <dig>  se <dig>  se <dig>  se <dig>  se <dig>  and se <dig> were significantly higher in human isolates than in egg isolates . the genetic diversity values  for loci se <dig>  se <dig>  se <dig>  se <dig>  and se <dig> were significantly higher in chicken isolates than in egg isolates .

overall genotype diversity  was significantly higher in mlva  compared to phage typing . the mlva genotype diversity was significantly higher in isolates from humans  and isolates from chickens , compared to isolates from eggs .

mlva clusters by minimum-spanning tree 
minimum-spanning tree  was created based on  <dig> distinct mlva types of  <dig> isolates from four different sources as described in figure  <dig>  the mst yielded a major cluster, a minor cluster, and four clonal expansions from the clusters. many source-specific clones were identified. in the major cluster, clone a <dig> primarily consisted of isolates from eggs  and clone a <dig> comprised only isolates from chickens . a big clone a <dig> in the major cluster includes isolates from all four sources. a small cluster, which is genetically distant from the major cluster, consisted mostly of isolates from humans.

source-specific mlva type is defined as a single mlva type of s. enteritidis isolate from a specific source. of  <dig> mlva types,  <dig>  were source-specific and the other  <dig> mlva types  were associated with isolates from multiple sources. among a total of  <dig> isolates from human, chicken, and egg sources,  <dig> isolates were classified into  <dig> source-specific mlva types . twenty-four  of  <dig> human s. enteritidis isolates belonged to  <dig> source-specific mlva types. the other  <dig> human isolates belonged to  <dig> mlva types that were identified among isolates from non-human sources. however, there was no significant difference in the proportion of isolates belonging to specific mlva types from humans compared to chickens and eggs . among the  <dig> chicken s. enteritidis isolates,  <dig>  isolates were classified into  <dig> source-specific mlva types. these specific mlva types were significantly associated with isolates from chickens compared to isolates from humans and eggs . six  of  <dig> egg isolates belonged to one egg-specific mlva type. therefore, these findings suggest that specific mlva types are more commonly associated with isolates from humans and chickens than isolates from eggs.

discussion
salmonella enteritidis circulates among several animal reservoirs particularly poultry, other animals and the environment. human infections are frequently acquired from consumption of contaminated eggs and poultry meat as well as foods contaminated with the organism.

prevention and control of the disease caused by s. enteritidis in human and animal populations require sensitive and specific molecular epidemiologic tools. however, molecular relatedness among s. enteritidis isolates from different reservoirs is not well studied.

liebana et al  <cit>  used genetic fingerprinting methods  for the assessment of diversity within s. enteritidis isolates from poultry farms. they concluded that a single typing method was not sufficient for discrimination and that a more sensitive method is needed to discriminate between strains from the different geographical and animal origins  <cit> .

multi-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis , which has been recently developed for subtyping of s. enteritidis isolates from human sporadic cases, showed high epidemiological concordance in outbreak strains  <cit> .

we have recently optimized and evaluated mlva using a multiplex pcr and demonstrated sufficient allelic variation that subdivided the s. enteritidis strains from human and non-human sources into numerous multilocus genotypes that constituted major clonal groups. therefore, mlva with high discriminatory power may be used to enhance the effectiveness of molecular epidemiologic investigation of s. enteritidis infections  <cit> .

in this study, we identified different allele distribution at most vntr loci among s. enteritidis isolates from different sources which suggests that patterns of allele distribution at some of the loci might be unique to isolates from specific sources. therefore, the vntr loci of unique allele distribution pattern can be used as potential markers for source tracking in the investigation of sporadic or outbreak cases.

among the nine loci, se <dig> and se <dig> had a wide range of alleles per locus  and their genetic diversity values  were also higher than other loci, resolving more frequent variation of these loci among isolates from humans and chickens than isolates from eggs . since these two loci may be hyper-mutatable, these findings are in support of the possible role of reservoir on the mutational rate or genetic variation of the s. enteritidis isolates.

variation in the number of repeat sequences at a given locus or sequence heterogeneity among individual units may be due to slipped-strand mispairing  which can occur in combination with inadequate dna mismatch repair pathways during replication  <cit> . this instability can occur at a frequency of 10- <dig> event per bacterial cell division and allows for a high frequency of genetic switching. bacteria can use this random event to adapt their genetic repertoire in response to selective environmental pressure  <cit> .

in this study, bacterial-host interaction could have contributed to broad genetic diversity of s. enteritidis isolates from humans and chickens as compared to isolates from eggs that had significantly lesser genetic diversity. this may be explained in part by the fact that egg isolates represent lineage of specific clones of s. enteritidis that are capable of causing transovarian transmission in the laying hens. a recent study suggested that single-nucleotide polymorphisms  occurring in the genomic fragment of s. enterica was linked to genetic drift within s. enteritidis that is associated with egg contamination  <cit> . furthermore, a differentially regulated gene that is responsible for persistence or survival of the s. enteritidis in egg albumin was identified  <cit> . whether snps variations or the differentially regulated genes have a modulating effect on the vntr diversity in isolates from eggs, more focused investigation including virulence profiling and vntr analyses of isolates from different sources may be needed. additionally, it is conceivable that humans may be more likely exposed to multiple strains of s. enteritidis due perhaps to frequent travel or consumption of contaminated foods that may be originated from diverse locations or sources  <cit> . therefore, it is conceivable that multiple infection sources and the high multiplication rate of s. enteritidis in humans and chickens could have resulted in higher genetic diversity of these isolates compared to egg isolates in which the lower genetic diversity may be due to their clonal selection as invasive strains and their low multiplication inside eggs.

stability of vntr markers for s. enteritidis has been previously reported  <cit>  and in another study, vntr markers for s. typhimurium  were found to be stable during the course of outbreak  <cit> . additionally, we have demonstrated the stability of vntr loci in s. enteritidis before and during experimental infection of a group of egg laying hens. vntr profiles were studied on isolates from internal organs from a subgroup of the infected birds at two week-intervals during the one months experiment . therefore, the stability of the vntr markers in this study has been well documented.

we have included in this study, groups of isolates from human and nonhuman sources within the same time frame  for comparison using mlva. application of the same mlva protocol on recent isolates from  <dig> human clinical cases of salmonella enteritidis that took place  produced similar useful mlva-based groups .

in comparing isolates from different sources for genetic diversity for each locus, different allelic diversity for certain loci was identified in isolates from different sources; human isolates showed significantly higher diversity in se <dig>  se <dig>  and se <dig> loci than both chicken and egg isolates. chicken isolates at loci se <dig> and se <dig> loci had significantly higher diversity than both human and egg isolates. these data may suggest an important role for the host in the genetic variation that can be encountered among s. enteritidis isolates from different sources.

in this study, mlva application enabled the mst cluster analysis of the s. enteritidis isolates by source allowing a great insight into the possible flow of these organisms between different reservoirs and humans as the most important accidental host. the clusters show a close relatedness among egg isolates. the isolates in the minor cluster appeared to be genetically far distant from isolates in the major cluster. a minor cluster consists mostly of pt4-like isolates  whereas most pt8-like isolates  belonged to the major cluster. most of the pt <dig> isolates from humans clustered together in the upper part of the dendrogram . these results are consistent with previous studies in which two separate lineages of serotype enteritidis phage types were suggested based on difference in the lps  <cit>  and based on presence of a subset of phage regions  <cit> .

for epidemiologic purposes, mlva subtyping can be promising in that it is of high discriminatory power, reproducibility, is less labor-intensive than pfge analysis, more easy to interpret and enables comparison of data between laboratories  <cit> .

one of the advantages of mlva over pfge is that the variation that is resolved can be interpreted as allelic variation at specific chromosomal loci, thus opening the door for population genetic analyses and phylogenetic inference. moreover, from a foodborne surveillance perspective, mlva is more discriminatory than pfge for s. enteritidis strains and provides better epidemiological concordance  <cit> . due to the ease and practical comparison of the profiles, mlva can be used as a powerful subtyping tool for s. enteritidis isolates in addition to current methods used to report molecular types of foodborne pathogens to central laboratories.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that there are differences in allele distribution and genetic diversity of vntr loci in s. enteritidis isolates from different sources. polymorphism in most of the vntr loci was more frequent among human s. enteritidis isolates than isolates from chickens or eggs. multiple infection sources and rate of multiplication of s. enteritidis in humans and chickens may lead to a higher genetic diversity whereas isolates from contaminated eggs have lower genetic diversity due to the fact that they may represent a select invasive clones of the organisms associated with a low multiplication inside the eggs. therefore, vntr profiles of s. enteritidis isolates from a specific source should be further evaluated as potential markers for epidemiologic studies for tracing s. enteritidis to their probable source.
