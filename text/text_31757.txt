BACKGROUND
fruit can be divided into two different ripening behaviours, climacteric and non-climacteric types. climacteric fruit such as banana and tomato generally exhibit ethylene and respiration surges during ripening but non-climacteric fruit such as grapes and capsicum do not  <cit> . the ethylene hormone also regulates the ripening rate of climacteric fruit but its function during non-climacteric ripening is still inadequately understood  <cit> . ethylene is produced from the 1-aminocyclopropane 1-carboxylate  precursor by the action of the acc oxidase  enzyme  <cit> . acc is synthesised by acc synthase  from s-adenosyl methionine  which originates from the amino acid methionine  <cit> . differences between the capability of climacteric and non-climacteric fruit to produce ethylene probably lie with the presence of two systems of ethylene production exclusively in climacteric fruit  <cit> .

during fruit development, ethylene is produced at a basal level in climacteric and non-climacteric fruit alike, a process known as system  <dig>  <cit> . when climacteric fruit reach maturity, another process called system  <dig> is initiated to produce a burst in ethylene production to promote ripening while non-climacteric fruit are thought to remain in system  <dig>  <cit> . the regulation of these two systems has been associated with the differential expression of aco and acs isoforms, especially when first characterised during tomato ripening  <cit> . there are at least six aco isoforms in tomato and nine known acs isoforms but only some of them are expressed during ripening to regulate the two systems  <cit> . for example, leacs1a and leacs <dig> were expressed during system  <dig> ethylene production and subsequently, leacs <dig> and leacs <dig> as well as leaco <dig> were highly induced during system  <dig> ethylene production. furthermore, system  <dig> is also known to be an auto-inhibitory system whereas system  <dig> is an auto-stimulatory system  <cit> . in climacteric tomato, system 1-associated isoforms  are negatively regulated by high ethylene whereas system 2-associated isoforms  are positively regulated  <cit> . given that these aco and acs isoforms were regulated by the presence of ethylene, its perception also appears integral to climacteric ripening. indeed, ethylene receptors  have been shown to be differentially regulated during ripening and upon ethylene treatment  <cit> . the six tomato etr isoforms can also be classified into two subfamilies, subfamily i  and subfamily ii , with possible differences between these groups explained by their affinity towards the downstream protein, constitutive triple response  <dig>   <cit> . however, the regulation of these isoforms and the two ethylene production systems during non-climacteric ripening is still inadequately documented and hence further research is needed.

given that capsicum belongs to the solanaceae family and shares genetic similarity with tomato, the characterisation of the same ethylene pathway in non-climacteric capsicum will enhance our understanding of differences in ethylene production in the two ripening types. earlier microarray studies have reported that transcripts associated with ethylene signalling were up-regulated in both capsicum and tomato ripening  <cit> . our recent proteomic analysis also revealed that during capsicum ripening, an aco protein isoform  <dig>  was increased , suggesting a conserved ethylene pathway may be involved in the ripening of this non-climacteric fruit  <cit> . however, further components of this pathway such as other aco isoforms, acs and etr isoforms and their regulation in capsicum are still not well described. additionally, capsicum exhibits a unique ripening behaviour when harvested off the plant; only ripening properly when harvested at breaker or later but not when harvested during the green stage  <cit> . this suggests ripening regulators may be present exclusively during breaker stage onwards to induce ripening in non-climacteric capsicum, possibly in an ethylene independent pathway . therefore, further post-harvest studies employing ethylene or 1-methylcyclopropene  treatment of both green and breaker stages are necessary to characterise the ethylene pathway and/or the possible involvement of ethylene independent pathways in the non-climacteric ripening of capsicum.

in this study we have investigated the expression of aco, acs and etr isoforms during capsicum  ripening using quantitative real-time pcr  at six different ripening stages . acs activity and acc content during the ripening stages were also examined to contrast their levels with climacteric fruit. furthermore, capsicum was treated with ethylene or 1-mcp at two different stages of ripening  and their effect on ripening, aco and acs activity, and acc content was analysed during post-harvest storage. the expression of caaco, caacs and caetr isoforms directly after treatment was also studied.

RESULTS
caaco, caacs and caetr isoforms were differentially expressed during capsicum ripening
throughout capsicum ripening, the transcript expression of most aco isoforms was limited except caaco <dig> . caaco <dig> relative expression  was significantly greater during ripening onset  with minimal expression during the full red stages . even though caaco <dig> and caaco <dig> transcripts were significantly increased at the dr stage and caaco <dig> was increased at the g stage, their relative expression levels throughout capsicum ripening stages were still very low compared to caaco <dig>  the relative transcript expression of caaco <dig> and caaco <dig> was also extremely low but constant during ripening.

both caacs <dig> and caacs <dig> were not highly expressed during ripening relative to cagapdh . the gene expression of both isoforms was also not significantly different during ripening but caacs <dig> was expressed more constantly throughout the six stages compared to caacs <dig> 

no significant change in the gene expression of any etr isoforms was measured during ripening . comparing their levels, caetr <dig> was the main isoform expressed during capsicum ripening. caetr <dig> appeared to slightly increase from g  to the br <dig>  and dr stages , but this was not statistically significant. in comparison, the expression of caetr <dig>  caetr <dig> and caetr <dig> was consistently low  in all stages of ripening.

acs activity and acc content were limited during capsicum ripening
the mean level of acs activity  was not significantly different among any of the stages between g and lr but increased significantly at the dr stage by approximately two-fold. acs activity in capsicum was approximately two to four times lower than the two positive climacteric controls . the level of acc content  only increased significantly from the g stage to the lr and dr stages. the amount of acc in ripe banana and tomato was approximately seven times higher than the average acc level throughout capsicum ripening. furthermore, the levels of acs activity and acc content reported here for banana and tomato as well as capsicum, correspond to other previous reports  <cit> .

the effects of ethylene or 1-mcp treatment
untreated b-harvested fruit ripened normally and developed to dr after 28 days in storage but untreated g-harvested fruit ripened incompletely . regardless of sampling time during storage, ethylene or 1-mcp treatment did not significantly affect the ripening behaviour  and colour development  of g-harvested capsicum. the extractable colour of g-harvested capsicum in all treatments and the control was slightly increased at 28 days after treatment  compared to earlier sampling times  but was still lower than the fully red coloured capsicum of untreated b-harvested control fruit . this amount of extractable colour was also achieved by others  <cit> , confirming our present result. in contrast, the ripening behaviour of 1-mcp treated b-harvested fruit was shown to be delayed compared to those treated with ethylene or the control especially from  <dig> to  <dig> dat . the extractable colour of both control and ethylene treated fruit reached  <dig> asta units at  <dig> dat whereas the 1-mcp treated fruit did not do so until  <dig> dat . regardless of sampling time, the ethylene treatment of b fruit did not significantly affect extractable colour but 1-mcp treatment significantly reduced it at  <dig> and  <dig> dat . in terms of percentage weight loss, there were no significant differences regardless of treatment or when fruit was harvested but there was an obvious increase in the percentage weight loss throughout sampling  indicating that the fruit were dehydrated over time .

in our previous report, the aco activity of capsicum increased significantly at b-br <dig> stages compared to the other ripening stages  <cit> . indeed, the aco activity reported here was also significantly higher in untreated b-harvested control fruit than untreated g-harvested control fruit at  <dig> dat . furthermore, at  <dig> dat, the aco activity of g fruit treated with ethylene was not significantly greater than the control while 1-mcp treated fruit had significantly lower aco activity than the control . on the other hand, the aco activity of b-harvested fruit treated with ethylene or 1-mcp was significantly lower than the activity of the untreated b-harvested control fruit. throughout storage, regardless of treatment, aco activity peaked slightly at  <dig> dat in g-harvested fruit while aco activity in b-harvested fruit generally exhibited a downward trend .

the acs activity of both g-harvested and b-harvested fruit  was not significantly different, regardless of sampling time and treatment, and significantly lower than the banana positive control .

regardless of sampling time during storage, the acc content of both g-harvested and b-harvested fruit  was consistently lower than the banana positive control . at  <dig> dat, g-harvested fruit treated with 1-mcp had significantly greater acc content compared to the control and ethylene-treated fruit. furthermore, at  <dig> dat, there was more acc in g-harvested ethylene-treated fruit compared to the untreated control and vice versa for b-harvested fruit. however, these acc levels  of both g and b harvested capsicum were not significantly different compared to 1-mcp-treated fruit. no other significant changes were observed between the control and treatments at any other dat.

differential expression of caaco, caacs and caetr isoforms directly after treatment  with ethylene or 1-mcp
the six caaco isoforms of capsicum exhibited differential expression upon ethylene or 1-mcp treatment . when comparing control and ethylene-treated samples of g-harvested fruit, caaco <dig> was not statistically significant. however, the relative expression of caaco <dig> and caaco <dig> was significantly lower  in the ethylene-treated samples compared to the respective control. moreover, the relative expression of other isoforms such as caaco <dig>  caaco <dig> and caaco <dig> was not significantly different between ethylene-treated and control g fruit samples. conversely, g-harvested fruit treated with 1-mcp had significantly lower caaco <dig>  caaco <dig>  caaco <dig> and caaco <dig> expression compared to the control. among these isoforms, caaco <dig> was affected the most by 1-mcp  while others had only approximately two to 11-fold differences. the 1-mcp treatment however did not significantly change caaco <dig> or caaco <dig> expression of g-harvested capsicum. for b-harvested capsicum, the relative expression of ethylene-treated samples was significantly higher for caaco <dig> but significantly lower for caaco <dig> compared to the respective control. ethylene had no effect on the expression of caaco <dig>  caaco <dig>  caaco <dig> and caaco <dig> while 1-mcp had no effect on caaco <dig>  caaco <dig>  caaco <dig>  and caaco <dig> in b-harvested fruit. in addition, 1-mcp treatment of b fruit caused caaco <dig> to be significantly lower than the control by three to five-fold and more so for caaco <dig> . when compared across the different aco isoforms within a particular treatment/control, caaco <dig> had the highest relative expression.

for the isolated caacs isoforms , both isoforms also showed differential expression upon treatment. caacs <dig> expression was significantly reduced in the ethylene-treated g fruit  and in 1-mcp-treated samples of both g and b harvested fruit . no significant relative expression differences were observed for caacs <dig> between treated samples and the control, where fruit was harvested at either ripening stage.

for the four caetr isoforms , different expression patterns were observed. firstly and regardless of the ripening stage that fruit were harvested and the treatment, no significant changes were measured for caetr <dig>  however, ethylene or 1-mcp treatment of g-harvested fruit did result in significantly lower caetr <dig> relative expression , while no significant differences were observed in b-harvested fruit for the two treatments. moreover, the relative expression of caetr <dig> upon ethylene treatment at the g stage was significantly higher by approximately two-fold compared to the control while 1-mcp treatment caused caetr <dig> relative expression to be lower by approximately 17-fold when compared to the g-harvested control. however, no significant difference in caetr <dig> expression between ethylene-treated and control fruit was observed when they had been treated at the b stage. nonetheless in b-harvested fruit, caetr <dig> relative expression was significantly lower by approximately 14-fold when 1-mcp-treated fruit were compared with the control. for caetr <dig> expression, no significant difference was observed between the control and ethylene-treated samples in both g and b fruit. however, 1-mcp treatment caused the caaco <dig> transcript level to significantly drop by approximately three to five-fold in both ripening stages compared to the control. in summary and when comparing different etr isoforms within a particular treatment/control, caetr <dig> still had the highest relative expression .

discussion
the molecular mechanisms of capsicum ripening are inadequately understood, particularly for non-climacteric behaviour. due to having genetic similarities with the model fruit tomato, capsicum may become a useful resource to elucidate the molecular regulation of non-climacteric ripening, especially with regards to the ethylene pathway. in this study we have demonstrated that acs activity and acc content were limited in capsicum while several aco, acs and etr isoforms were differentially regulated upon ripening and ethylene treatment. furthermore, 1-mcp treatment during the onset of ripening  significantly delayed ripening and reduced the expression of several isoforms, indicating that ethylene perception may be required, to some extent, for non-climacteric fruit ripening to occur.

rate limiting acs activity during capsicum ripening affects the level of its product, acc
the presence of acs protein appears to be the rate limiting step in the ethylene pathway of capsicum. even though aco activity was greater in b fruit than other ripening stages  and the level in capsicum seems to be comparable with the climacteric tomato during ripening  <cit> ; capsicum acs activity was approximately two to four-fold lower than that for the climacteric fruit used as positive controls . in addition, the pattern of caacs <dig> expression corresponded well with the basal level of acs activity during g to lr, and the increase of acs activity during dr  may be due to both caacs <dig> and caacs <dig> expression at the same time . an earlier study on caacs <dig> also showed that its expression was minimal but constant throughout capsicum ripening stages  <cit> , thus corroborating our current findings. furthermore, acs activity in climacteric fruit has been shown to be increased during ripening onset  <cit>  but its level in capsicum remained constant for most of the ripening stages , suggesting that acs was the rate limiting step in this non-climacteric fruit.

the level of acc, the product formed from sam by the action of acs, was also very low in capsicum such that there was on average, seven-fold less acc during capsicum ripening compared to the climacteric tomato and banana . the level of acc content in capsicum has previously been shown to be limited  <cit>  in a similar manner as other non-climacteric fruit including strawberry  <cit>  and grapes  <cit> . this is further corroborated by the significant increase in acc level observed during the lr and dr stages , probably in response to the limited aco activity  <cit>  preventing its conversion to ethylene. furthermore, reducing the amount of aco activity significantly by means of 1-mcp application during the g stage  also increased acc content . this confirms that not only acc is limited in capsicum but that it might also be continually required for the basal level of ethylene production. however, no increase in acc content was observed in b fruit directly after 1-mcp treatment despite the reduction in aco activity, probably because the aco activity level was still high in b-treated fruit compared to g-treated fruit . this suggests that the low levels of ethylene produced /h for our capsicum compared to  <dig> -3 nl/g fw/h ethylene production for the banana and tomato used as controls in this study; data not shown) was probably due to the lack of precursors for ethylene production caused by the restricted acs activity.

differential expression of systems  <dig> and 2-associated isoforms in non-climacteric capsicum ripening
the ripening of climacteric tomato is generally accompanied by a burst in ethylene production which is caused by system  <dig>  the transition from the negative feedback mechanism of system  <dig> during fruit development to the positive feedback mechanism of system  <dig> during the ripening of mature fruit can be regulated by the differential expression of specific isoforms in the ethylene pathway  <cit> . for example, leacs1a and leacs <dig> are considered to be system  <dig> components as they are expressed in immature fruit and are negatively regulated by ethylene treatment  <cit> . once fruit reach maturity, leacs <dig> and leacs <dig> are highly expressed during ripening and upon ethylene treatment, suggesting that they are system 2-associated isoforms  <cit> . the climacteric increase in ethylene production during system  <dig> was also supported by the up-regulation of aco isoforms particularly leaco <dig>  and to some extent leaco <dig> <cit> . the application of ethylene to the mature g stage not only significantly increased these aco isoforms  <cit>  but also induced the expression of etr isoforms, primarily leetr <dig>  leetr <dig> and leetr <dig> <cit> . the regulation of the two ethylene production systems in non-climacteric fruit is however still not fully described but system  <dig> is generally considered to be operating throughout ripening  <cit> .

indeed, the expression and regulation of the ethylene pathway components in non-climacteric capsicum were somewhat different compared to the climacteric tomato. for instance, caacs <dig> was not highly expressed during ripening  and upon ethylene treatment , while caetr <dig> and caaco <dig> did respond to ethylene but only to some extent in either g or b-harvested fruit, respectively . caaco <dig> expression was also limited throughout capsicum ripening  which confirmed earlier reports  <cit> . the failure of caaco <dig> and caacs <dig> to be highly stimulated upon ripening and ethylene exposure as in climacteric tomato may suggest the absence of system  <dig>  thus the burst in ethylene production associated with this system could not be induced in this non-climacteric fruit. furthermore, caaco <dig> could be considered the major isoform expressed during capsicum ripening onset  as no other aco isoform exhibited similar levels of up-regulation . this is in good agreement with our previous report on caaco <dig> expression using semi-quantitative rt-pcr and the overall aco activity level during capsicum ripening  <cit> . interestingly, caaco <dig> was negatively regulated by ethylene  particularly in b-harvested fruit suggesting its negative regulation may result in the lower overall aco activity observed after ethylene treatment when compared to the untreated control fruit . other isoforms such as caaco <dig>  caacs <dig> and caetr <dig> were also down-regulated upon ethylene treatment particularly at the g stage , which implies that system  <dig> may be predominantly operating in this non-climacteric fruit ripening rather than system  <dig> 

the down-regulation of several transcripts upon ethylene treatment also suggests that other ripening regulators that might control their expression during capsicum ripening. these ripening regulators might also be present exclusively during the b stage as g-harvested fruit did not ripen properly and the aco activity of g-harvested capsicum cannot be induced to the level of b capsicum even with ethylene treatment . caaco <dig>  which may be considered to be a system 1-associated isoform, was up-regulated during ripening onset  which suggests that its up-regulation might be closely associated with these ripening regulators in an ethylene-independent manner. two pathways, ethylene dependent- and independent- pathways, have been suggested to operate in climacteric fruit but only the latter pathway may be conserved in non-climacteric fruit to induce ripening  <cit> . the main regulators of the ethylene-independent pathways especially in non-climacteric fruit are still unknown but the lemads-rin transcription factor  has been proposed to be one of the regulators  <cit> . rin has been shown to control ripening even prior to the climacteric ethylene production in tomato, suggesting that this transcription factor may sit upstream of the ethylene pathway  <cit> . indeed, rin has been shown to regulate, directly or indirectly, the expression of several ethylene pathway components including leacs <dig> and leaco <dig> <cit> . interestingly, the expression of the two isoform homologues in capsicum, caacs <dig> and caaco <dig>  were limited . furthermore, leaco <dig> may be considered to be a system 2-associated isoform  <cit>  in contrast to the system 1-associated caaco <dig> . this difference might be attributable to genetic rearrangement that heavily occurred in capsicum when compared with tomato  <cit> , such that upstream promoter regulation is no longer similar between these  solanaceae members. further investigation is therefore needed to compare the isoform promoter regions of both fruit as well as the possible involvement of rin or other ripening regulators in the ethylene-independent pathway of capsicum ripening.

ethylene perception may be partially required in capsicum ripening especially during ripening onset
although the ethylene independent pathway may exist in non-climacteric ripening, our results also highlighted that ethylene perception may still be needed for capsicum ripening, to some extent. 1-mcp treatment, which blocks ethylene perception, delayed the ripening rate of b capsicum by approximately seven days . the application of 1-mcp on other non-climacteric fruit such as grapes and strawberry also has been shown to slow some ripening aspects  <cit> . furthermore, subfamily ii receptors, caetr <dig> and caetr <dig> were significantly less in 1-mcp-treated samples compared to the control , which may consequently influence the down-regulation of other downstream ethylene pathway components such as caacs <dig>  caaco <dig> and caaco <dig> . subfamily ii caetr <dig> may also be considered to be the major etr isoform expressed in capsicum due to its higher overall relative expression during ripening . interestingly, in strawberry, faetr <dig> which is closely related to leetr <dig> was also the major isoform expressed  <cit> . since both caetr <dig> and faetr <dig> belong to subfamily ii etrs which may have weaker binding with the ctr <dig> protein  <cit> , the basal level of ethylene in the non-climacteric fruit may be sufficient to induce considerable changes to downstream ethylene responses and the inhibition of the ethylene perception may also severely impact ripening.

ethylene binding has been associated with controlling the rate of ethylene receptor turnover in tomato  <cit> , and in the case of non-climacteric fruit, the basal level of ethylene may be needed to sustain a certain receptor level and hence maintain ethylene perception for normal ripening to proceed. this was further corroborated by our findings in that ethylene treatment did not induce any significant changes towards ripening , and the expression of all four measured etr isoforms at the b stage in capsicum after ethylene exposure were also constant compared to the control . this implies that there may be no more receptors available to accept ethylene  especially during ripening onset and thus there were no effects towards the ethylene perception and response for ripening. this further suggests that only a certain level of ethylene receptors and perception are required for the ripening process, together with the ethylene independent pathway as described earlier. therefore, a high ethylene level may not be needed and the energy saved can be utilised for other ripening related events such as colour and textural modification. however, any mrna expression changes  need to be confirmed with respective protein expression assays as post-translational regulation has been shown to strictly affect the receptor protein abundance  <cit> . in addition, given that the capsicum chinensis gene ccgh <dig>  which has been shown to influence fruit ripening, is regulated by both ethylene and auxin  <cit> , whether a similar situation is possible for caetr needs to be investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, the limited level of ethylene produced in non-climacteric capsicum may be contributed by the rate limiting acs activity which restricts the acc content. furthermore, several isoforms of ethylene-related genes were differentially expressed in capsicum, suggesting alternative regulation and the likelihood that ethylene production in non-climacteric ripening is predominantly by system  <dig> with system  <dig> being absent . ethylene independent pathway may also be present during capsicum ripening onset but some level of ethylene perception may still be needed for the induction of non-climacteric fruit ripening .
