BACKGROUND
hiv infection is still a pandemic disease with more than  <dig> million people infected today. hiv-positive individuals experience cognitive dysfunction, disordered behaviour and problems with movement and balance which are indicated, at the late stage, as hiv-associated dementia   <cit> . in fact, neurodegenerative disorders have commonly been described in patients suffering from aids and this occurs even though neurons are not infected following hiv-brain tissues invasion . even if the employment of highly active antiretroviral therapy  has changed the scenario of the hiv dementia by improving the cognitive performance in some patients with hiv-associated cognitive impairment, new cases of hiv dementia continue to develop  <cit> . in addition, the prevalence of hiv dementia is rising as patients on haart live longer with hiv infection  <cit>  suggesting that, in the era of haart, had or milder forms still remain high  <cit> . thus, the neuropathogenesis of hiv-infection and better therapeutic approaches for the management of neuroaids still remain to be elucidated.

evidence exists that astrocytes may play a role in hiv-related neurological disorders. indeed, reactive astrogliosis and the presence of activated and hypertrophied astrocytes, has commonly been described in the brain of patients suffering from had  <cit> . on the other hand, in vivo studies have also shown that hiv infection mat also occur in a small and variable fraction of astrocytes, mainly in advanced brain disease  <cit> , thus suggesting that astrocyte are actively involved in the pathogenesis of had.

although the incidence of astroglial cell death in hiv-infected brain tissues is still to be better clarified, evidence suggests that astrocytes may also suffer dysfunction in the hiv-infected brain that may extend beyond the limited levels of hiv- infection and contribute to neuropathogenesis in distinct pathways . it is known that astrocytes are likely exposed continuously to hiv particles, viral proteins, cytokines, and other substances secreted by hiv-infected macrophages and microglia. although they lack cd <dig> they express cxcr <dig>  and under certain circumstances, ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  the co-receptors for hiv entry into cells . these chemokine receptors can transduce responses to chemokines and to hiv gp <dig> present in the brain and they might be involved in hiv association with astrocytes. studies in vitro indicate that many of these products significantly modulate astrocyte physiology which in turn can alter essential interactions of astrocytes with other cells in the brain, particularly neurons. for example, exposure of cultured astrocytes to hiv, recombinant gp <dig>  or viral transactivator tat induces some of the same secretable mediators of neuropathogenesis as those produced by macrophages, including inflammatory cytokines tnf-α and il-1β, chemokines mcp- <dig> and ip- <dig>  il- <dig>  or free radicals such as nitric oxide and peroxynitrite  <cit> .

the apparent dysregulation of astrocyte immune functions might contribute to the overall inflammatory environment in the brain but also may account for excitotoxic mechanisms which have been shown to occur in hiv-infected brain tissues. in particular, evidence exists that glutammatergic transmission is inbalanced in the brain of had patients. in particular, studies in culture revealed that intact hiv or exogenous gp120-induced extensive changes in astrocyte gene expression  <cit>  and impaired transport of extracellular glutamate by astrocytes  <cit> , a defect which may lead to neuronal death by glutamate excitotoxicity  <cit> . glutamate uptake can also be impaired by intracellular expression of recombinant tat or exposure of astrocytes to tnf-α  <cit> . on the other hand, intracellular ca2+ is increased by gp <dig> in neurons and astrocytes, an effect driven by enhanced glutamate receptor signalling  <cit> . finally, recombinant gp <dig> was shown to induce ca2+-dependent glutamate secretion by astrocytes and neuronal cell death in glial-neuronal co-cultures in a pathway involving signaling through cxcr <dig> and production of tnf-α  <cit> . thus, hiv-related neurotoxins, such as gp <dig>  might disregulate astrocytic viability via multiple mechanisms including an imbalanced modulation of glutamate turnover.

the present study has been performed to investigate 1) the effect of n-acetylcysteine , on gp120-induced changes of viability of human cultured astroglial cells and its correlation with gp120-related changes of lipid peroxidation ; 2) the effect of nac on gp120-induced changes of glutamine synthase , the enzyme which metabolises glutamate into glutamine in astroglial cells thereby playing a neuroprotective role  <cit> .

RESULTS
incubation of human cultured astroglial cells with gp  <dig>  for  <dig> h produced a decrease of cell viability as shown by counts of pre-treated astrocytes performed in trypan blue . the reduction of astroglial cell viability due to incubation with gp <dig> was accompanied by apoptotic cell death. indeed, measurement of apoptotic cell death as quantified by means of facs analysis showed an enhanced number of hypoploid cells indicating programmed cell death due to gp <dig> incubation . this was confirmed by immunocytochemical assay by means of tunel reaction which showed apoptotic nuclei and dna fragmentation .

the effect of gp  <dig> on cell viability was accompanied by a reduction of glutamine formation and gs expression in gp 120-treated astroglial cells. indeed, incubation of cultured astroglial cells with gp  <dig>  for  <dig> h, produced a significant decrease of the amount of glutamine in cell supernatants as measured by glutamine assay . these results were confirmed by western blotting analysis and immunocytochemistry which showed that gp  <dig>  reduced significantly gs expression in gp 120-treated astroglial cells .

the effect of gp  <dig> was associated with overproduction of free radical species and subsequent lipid peroxidation. indeed, incubation of cultured astrocytes with gp  <dig> , produced a prominent elevation of mda levels in cell homogenates thus suggesting that the astroglial cell damaging due to incubation with gp  <dig> on astrocytes was accompanied by oxidative stress.

pre-incubation of astroglial cells cells with nac , restored astroglial cell viability in gp 120-treated cells. in addition, nac dose-dependently antagonized the pro-apoptotic effect of  <dig> nm of gp  <dig> when quantified by facs analysis , an effect confirmed by tunel immunostaining when higher concentration of nac  was used. in addition, nac  restored the concentration of glutamine in cell supernatant in gp120-treated astrocytes , and the gs expression as evaluated by means of western blotting analysis  an effect confirmed by gs immunostaining in gp 120-treated cells . finally, nac  inhibited mda accumulation due to gp  <dig>  thus suggesting that antioxidant properties of nac might contribute in restoring the imbalanced gs activity subsequent to incubation of astrocytes with gp  <dig> 

discussion
the present data show that gp  <dig>  a coating component of hiv envelope which has been shown to possess neurotoxic properties  <cit> , leads to apoptotic cell death of human cultured astrocytes, an effect antagonised by nac. this effect seems, at least in part, to be related to the antioxidant effect of this compound even though other effects of nac on pathophysiological events leading to gp120-related astroglial cell injury cannot be excluded. the effect of nac on gp120-induced reduction of astroglial cell viability is in accordance with previous data from our  <cit>  and other groups  showing that oxidative stress may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of had. our data also show, for the first time, that gp <dig> leads to an imbalanced gs activity and expression in cultured astrocytes this effect being accompanied by abnormal generation of free radicals and inhibited by nac. this suggests that enhanced glutamatergic neurotransmission, which has been shown to contribute in hiv-related neurological disorders, may involve oxidative-mediated changes of gs in astrocytes.

evidence exists that glutamate is highly neurotoxic when accumulated in massive amount in the extracellular space  <cit> . in the cns, the conversion of glutamate to glutamine, that takes place within the astrocytes, represents a key mechanism in the regulation of excitatory neurotransmission under normal conditions as well as in injured brain  <cit> . in particular, it is known that the synaptically released glutamate is taken up by astroglial cells and then converted into nontoxic glutamine by the glia-specific enzyme glutamine synthase ; on the other hand, glutamine re-enters the glutamatergic neuron where is converted by glutaminase into glutamate, thus replenishing the neurotransmitter pool  <cit> . during pathological conditions such as had, stroke or several chronic neurodegenerative diseases, the duration and intensity of glutamate release might overwhelm the capacity of the gs enzyme to remove it. such an imbalance should result in glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity and could contribute to brain injury supporting the hypothesis that an increase in gs expression exerts a neuroprotective effect  <cit> . the possible modulation of gs activity has been studied during numerous neuropathological states, including inflammation, ischemia/reperfusion injury etc.  <cit> . in particular, overproduction of reactive oxygen species, which occurs during excitotoxicity in brain tissues, leads to reduced ability of astroglial cells to regulate glutamate turnover via inhibition of gs activity  <cit> . in addition, oxidative inactivation of gs during ischemia/reperfusion in the gerbil's brain has been described indicating that free radical-dependent inactivation may be a critical factor in the neurotoxicity which follows ischemia/reperfusion injury  <cit> . on the other hand, it has been suggested that peroxynitrite, generated by the reaction between nitric oxide  and superoxide anions  <cit> , leads to nitration of gs tyrosine residues thus leading to significant dysregulation of proteins undergoing adenylylation regulation in signal transduction cascades  <cit> . thus, the dysfunction of glutamate metabolism, which has been suggested to contribute in hiv-related neuropathogenesis, might occur also via the contribution of gp 120-mediated oxidative stress, an effect mediated by glutamine metabolism dysfuntion which, in turn, might contributes in apoptotic cell death of brain cells which follows hiv infection of brain macrophages.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the present experiments demonstrate that gp  <dig> is neurotoxic in astroglial cells, an effect accompanied by lipid peroxidation and by altered glutamine release. all the effect of gp <dig> on astroglial cells were counteracted by nac thus suggesting a novel and potentially useful approach in the treatment of glutamatergic disorders found in had patients.
