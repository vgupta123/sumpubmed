BACKGROUND
sign languages exhibit all characteristics of natural language systems: they have a complex compositional structure, in which signs  are combined to create higher level structures   <cit>  respectively,  <cit> . however, sign languages remarkably differ from spoken languages with respect to the manner in which they express grammatical relations. signs are articulated in space and are specified at locations around the signer. this process is called “spatial mapping”. a noun can be specified in the signing space in three different ways: a) by signing the noun and indexing it to a location in the signing space, e.g., the right side of the signer, b) by signing the noun directly at a specific location, or c) by signing the noun and locating it through the starting point of the following verb movement  <cit> . to express verb agreement, the verb movement and/or palm orientation starts at the location of the subject and ends at the location of the object. cross-linguistically, sign languages exhibit a strong typological homogeneity in their agreement system  <cit> . this might be due to the fact that all known sign languages use the space around the signer . verb agreement in all known sign languages makes use of these loci in space as well  <cit> . despite the linguistic similarities between signed and spoken languages, the surface structure is radically different, such as to use visual-spatial contrasts  to mark grammatical relations in signed languages. such differences in the surface structure between languages of different modalities offer a unique opportunity to investigate the neurobiology of human language. native signers are often deaf individuals born to deaf parents. thus, these individuals commonly acquire a sign language from their parents and siblings from an early age. it has been shown that the developmental milestones of natural signed language acquisition correspond to those in natural spoken languages  <cit> . moreover, lesion and neuroimaging studies on sign language users have suggested a considerable overlap in the neural organization for spoken and sign language processing in deaf native signers . as spoken languages, sign languages  and american sign language ) activate the left inferior frontal cortex. some authors  <cit>  have pointed out that the higher activation of homologous right hemispheric structures in sign language processing compared to the processing of a spoken language might be related to the higher reliance of signed languages on spatial functions. however, in these studies asl processing has been compared with written english. when investigating audio-visual spoken language with sign language no difference in right hemispheric recruitment were observed  <cit> .

to date, relatively little is known about the neural representation of different linguistic domains in sign language processing. neurolinguistic research of the past years has established reliable event-related potential  indicators for different aspects of oral language processing  <cit> : semantic processing  has commonly been associated with a centro-posterior negativity emerging after e.g., implausible words with a latency of about 400 ms . traditionally, the n <dig> effect has been assumed to reflect lexical semantic integration processes  <cit> .

in contrast, morphosyntactic violations in e.g., verb agreement are associated with a frontal negativity emerging with a latency of approximately 300 ms . this negativity is commonly followed by a positive wave with an onset latency of at least 500 ms   <cit> ). this biphasic pattern of a lan and p <dig> has been observed for verb agreement violations in various languages  <cit> . traditionally, it has been proposed that the lan reflects early syntactic processing  <cit>  and/or working memory functions related to complex processing operations  <cit> . by contrast, the p <dig> has been suggested to be associated with processes of syntactic and semantic reanalysis and integration  <cit> . however, some researchers have demonstrated that the n <dig> might be modulated by syntactic processing aspects  and the p <dig> might be modulated by semantic processing aspects under some specific conditions  <cit> . we employed only types of violations for which previous research has demonstrated clearly distinct erp patterns, that is, an n <dig> effect for the semantic manipulation and a lan followed by a p <dig> for the syntactic manipulation.

in their pioneering studies on the neural correlates of sign language processing, neville et al.  <cit>  compared erps to open vs. closed class language elements and reported similar erp correlates for single signs of asl and oral word processing. a recent erp study by capek et al. has, in addition, investigated the processing of continuously presented asl sentences  <cit> . deaf native users of asl watched signed sentences that were correct or comprised either a semantic violation  or a morphosyntactic verb agreement error. the deaf participants, who were all native signers of asl, showed an n <dig> effect for semantically implausible signs similar to previously observed effects for corresponding violations in oral languages. by contrast, morphosyntactic verb agreement errors a left frontal negativity followed by a posterior positivity   <cit> . recently, hosemann et al. published an n <dig> effect to unexpected vs. expected sentence final  verbs of dgs  <cit> .

while the neural correlates of language have been compared between a number of different oral languages, electrophysiological studies on sign languages investigating different linguistic domains to date have mostly concentrated on asl. to identify the functional organization of sign language comprehension, distinct patterns of neural activation for different linguistic aspects – such as semantic and syntactic processes within the same participants – have to be demonstrated in more than one sign language. the present study employed naturally signed dgs with both semantic  and morphosyntactic  violations. in sum, the present study aimed at determining whether semantic and morphosyntactic aspects of dgs can be dissociated within the same individuals.

native signers watched continuous dgs sentences, which were either correct or incorrect. incorrect sentences comprised either an implausible sign or a verb-agreement violation in the middle position of a sentence. we used a different type of verb agreement violation than capek et al. that can be clearly classified as a morphosyntactic error by sign language linguistics  <cit> . moreover, in contrast to hosemann et al.  <cit> , we introduced the violation in the sentence middle position, because the processing of sentence final words activates additional processes, e.g., related to integration  <cit> . the participants’ task was to indicate at the end of each sentence whether or not the sentence was correct. in contrast to the stimuli used by capek et al., the native signer, who signed the sentences was instructed to minimize affective and paralinguistic facial expressions and body movements. this allowed us to minimize coarticulation and paralinguistic effects. we expected distinct erp patterns for semantic and morphosyntactic violations: a centro-posterior n <dig> like effect was predicted for semantic and a frontally distributed negativity followed by a posterior positivity was predicted for morphosyntactic violations.

RESULTS
behavioral data
the analysis of the percentages of correct responses revealed that deaf native signers  correctly judged  <dig> %  of the correct sentences,  <dig> %  of semantically incorrect sentences and  <dig> %  of morphosyntactically anomalous sentences.

eeg data
semantic condition
the erps of deaf native signers for the critical verb of correct sentences and semantically incorrect sentences are displayed in figure  <dig>  semantically incorrect sentences elicited a more negative going potential compared to the correct sentences. this observation was confirmed by a main effect of condition  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ) for the time window of 550–750 ms. furthermore, a significant interaction of condition and cluster  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ) was revealed indicating a bilateral fronto-central scalp distribution of the violation effect. the latter was significant at clusters l <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig> .

syntactic condition
the erp data for the critical verb for deaf native signers for correct sentences and morphosyntactically incorrect sentences are shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  morphosyntactically incorrect sentences elicited a negative potential  in the time epoch 400–600 ms and a positive wave  in the time epoch 1000–1300 ms.

the anova  <cit>  revealed a three way interaction of condition and hemisphere by cluster  =  <dig> ; eps =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ) in the time window 400–600 ms indicating a typical left lateralized frontal distribution of the lan. the negative difference between correct and incorrect sentences was significant at clusters l <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig> .

a significant main effect of condition  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ) was observed in the second time epoch of 1000–1300 ms, confirming a larger positivity in the response to morphosyntactic violations compared to morphosyntactically correct signs. in addition, the interaction of condition by cluster was significant  =  <dig> ; eps =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ), indicating the typical posterior distribution of the p <dig>  the positive difference was significant at all clusters .

discussion
semantic and morphosyntactic violations addressing two functionally different linguistic aspects within german sign language  elicited clearly distinct erp patterns. semantic violations  were followed by a negative erp with a fronto-central scalp distribution . by contrast, syntactic violations  elicited a frontal negativity  followed by a central positivity .

the n <dig> observed in native signers had a more anterior distribution than observed in reading studies  <cit> . a more anterior distribution of the n <dig> has been reported for auditory stimuli as well  <cit> , i.e., a modality that resembles sign language in its temporal dynamics more than written language does.

by contrast, other sign language studies have found a more posteriorly distributed n <dig> effect for both single noun signs and implausible nouns in sign language sentences  <cit> . this effect could be explained by the processing of different word classes. in contrast to asl, dgs has a different word order: while asl is a subject-verb-object language, dgs belongs to the subject-object-verb languages. therefore, the semantic violation is only detectable at the verb that follows the implausible object. hence, the critical sign in the present dgs study was the verb rather than the object, as it was the case in the study of capek et al.  <cit> .

several studies have shown that processing words from different grammatical classes  seem to engage different neural networks  <cit> . thus, another account for the different distributions of the n <dig> effect in the present and in the study of capek et al.  <cit>  may be the use of critical words from different word classes. indeed, in an accompanying experiment with written german sentences, we found a similar posterior topography of the n <dig> in the deaf native signers as observed in hearing l <dig> and hearing l <dig> users of german  <cit> . in this study the critical word was the object.

in a recent erp study on dgs, hosemann et al. observed an n <dig> to action and non-action verbs but did not discuss the topography of the n <dig> effect for unexpected action vs. non-action words. from their figures it seems as if the n <dig> effect to the non-action verbs had a more posterior distribution than the n <dig> effect to the action verbs. since we used action verbs in our study, this result would fit nicely with our data.

by contrast, morphosyntactic violations elicited a left lateralized negativity with an anterior distribution. the anterior negativity was followed by a broadly distributed positivity with a central maximum. both effects were highly similar to what has been observed previously, following both a large number of different syntactic anomalies in aural-oral languages  <cit>  and verb agreement violations in asl  <cit> . however, our effects emerged later than in these studies  <cit> . these latency differences can be explained by the different trigger positions for erp timelocking. as mentioned in the methods sign languages have long transition phases between two consecutive signs. since in the morphosyntactic condition the location change of the sign is more crucial than the target sign itself we set the trigger position to the first detectable change in location with respect to the preceeding sign. this early trigger position caused the late onset of the violation effects. indeed, hosemann et al. showed for their n <dig> effects that changing the trigger along the transition phase changes the timing of the n <dig> effect.

particularly impressive in our data is the clear left lateralization of the anterior negativity  which has previously been reported as a response to verb-agreement violations both in spoken english and german  <cit> . our results extend the findings of capek et al.  <cit> . remarkably, the verb agreement violation used in our study differed from the two used by in this study: as a verb agreement violation they used reversed movement from the object location to the subject location instead of visa versa or a movement from the correct subject location to a non-defined location in space. capek et al. suggested that the larger right hemispheric distribution of the violation effect for the second compared to the first violation type was mainly due to the increased spatial mapping requirements for non-localized signs in space. in contrast, in our study we combined the use of an unspecified and a wrong location in one verb agreement violation: the verb moved from a neutral  subject position to the deictic first person object location. compared to capek et al., we clearly introduced the referential positions of subject and object in the signing space before the verb sign making spatial mapping by verb movement unlikely. though in our paradigm the verb movement starts at an unspecified location as well, the starting point of the verb movement does not allow for a localization of the subject, because it has already been located at a different place before. thus, the verb movement was clearly grammatically incorrect. hence, no additional mapping process was necessary. the error between referential positions and verb movement was – as in typical syntactic parcing processes – most likely to be automatically detected as a morphosyntactic mismatch. this is explaining why we found a clearly left lateralized anterior negativity, similar to that observed in the asl reversed verb agreement condition of capek et al.

CONCLUSIONS
consistent with previous research on oral and signed languages, we provide evidence that semantic and syntactic aspects of dgs are distinct processes, i.e., processes mediated by different neural systemes.
