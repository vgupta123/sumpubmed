BACKGROUND
the life-cycle of the malarial parasite, plasmodium falciparum , consists of several morphological forms which occur in the mosquito, liver and blood stages . pf generates these morphologies by regulating its gene expression; the morphological transformations are accompanied by changes in the rna and protein repertoires of the cell  <cit> . the transcriptome of the pf asexual intraerythrocytic developmental cycle  has been analysed and transcriptional regulation has been shown to orchestrate a continuous cascade of gene expression, with genes being induced once per cycle, in a "just-in-time" manner, only when the gene product is required by the cell  <cit> . the question then arises as to how such fine-tuned regulation of gene expression is achieved in this extreme parasite.

in functional genomics, it is believed to be likely that genes with similar mrna expression profiles  are regulated via the same mechanism ; similarly, it is thought to be likely that genes with similar functions are regulated by the same mechanism. co-expressed genes which also have similar functions are more likely to be co-regulated  <cit> . they are likely to have conserved dna sequence elements, called transcription factor binding motifs , in their promoter regions. tfbms act as binding sites for transcription factors and coordinate the expression of the genes in whose promoter regions they appear. they are about 6– <dig> nucleotides  in length and occur upstream of the gene transcription start site . in response to environmental and developmental cues, tfbms are bound by their cognate transcription factors, and, as a result, co-expression of the associated set of genes takes place, by activation or inhibition of the transcription machinery  <cit> .

transcription of pf genes appears to take place monocistronically, and pf promoters have a bipartite structure consisting of a basal promoter regulated by upstream enhancer elements  <cit> . the number of transcription associated proteins  encoded by the pf genome is about one third the number of taps associated with the transcriptional process in free-living eukaryotes  <cit> . the basal transcriptional apparatus  in pf is similar to that in free-living eukaryotes. chromatin remodeling complexes and histone acetylases and deacetylases, which modulate the accessibility of dna to transcription factors, are also present. however, there are relatively few proteins in pf which show homology to known transcriptional regulators and which contribute to gene-specific transcriptional regulation  <cit> . thus, it would appear that a system of transcriptional regulators  might not be the sole mechanism by which coordinated expression of genes is achieved during the pf life-cycle.

post-transcriptional mechanisms have been proposed to play an important role in the regulation of gene expression in pf  <cit> . the ccch-type zinc finger domain  was found to be almost twice as abundant in the pf genome as in free-living eukaryotes. this type of zinc finger functions in regulating mrna stability and translation  <cit> . further, the pf genome encodes homologues of components of the ccr4-not complex, which has cytoplasmic mrna deadenylase activity; deadenylation modifies the rates of translation initiation and is the rate-limiting step in mrna decay. mrna decay rates, on a genome-wide scale, during the idc of pf have been determined  <cit> . globally, mrna decay rates were found to increase during the idc . the authors suggest that, in the late stage parasites, the morphological changes taking place  may complicate regulation of transcription, and, instead, global stabilization of mrna may be regulating gene expression. all these observations provide evidence that post-transcriptional mrna processing plays an important role in regulating protein levels during the pf life cycle.

translational repression has also been shown to be a means of regulating gene expression in pf  <cit> . in gametocytes, there are transcripts which are abundant, but are in a state of translational repression. rna binding proteins, called puf proteins, which are upregulated in gametocytes, repress the translation of the mrnas  <cit> ; they do so by binding to a uugu motif in the 3' untranslated region  of their respective target mrnas. multiple copies of this motif occur in the 3' utrs. another mrna binding protein that has been characterized is pfirpa, an iron regulatory-like protein; it binds to an iron-responsive element, a stem-loop structure formed at 5' and 3' utrs of mrna, and functions to inhibit translation or to modulate the stability of mrna  <cit> .

the  <dig> stages of the pf idc have been considered and changes in mrna and protein abundance over the  <dig> stage-transitions in the cycle – the merozoite/ring, ring/trophozoite, trophozoite/schizont and schizont/merozoite transitions – have been examined  <cit> . for 55% of the genes, mrna and protein abundance changes followed similar trends over stage transitions; these were genes whose expression was regulated at the transcriptional level. for the remaining genes, response in protein levels was not complementary to changes in mrna levels; for most of these genes, however, changes in mrna and protein levels became complementary when the mrna abundance changes observed over one transition were compared with protein abundance changes over the succeeding transition . these were genes whose expression was regulated at the post-transcriptional level. thus, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation appear to be of equal importance in the pf idc. however, while transcriptional regulation is important, the pf genome appears to encode fewer transcriptional regulators than free-living eukaryotes  <cit> , and while post-transcriptional regulation is important, the mechanism by which it is achieved is not clear  <cit> .

given the reasonable importance of transcriptional regulation in pf, in the present study, an attempt has been made to search for potential regulatory sequences in the upstream regions of co-expressed pf genes, using in silico motif-discovery methods. regulatory sites in pf have previously been identified using such procedures. a g-rich regulatory element upstream of several pf heat shock protein  genes has been identified using the alignace program  <cit> . the regulatory element, named as g-box, has the consensus sequence, ngggg, and has been shown to be required for reporter gene expression in transient transfection experiments. in another study, computational methods have first been used to identify modules of co-regulated pf genes, and motif detection tools have then been used to identify potential tfbms in these modules  <cit> . for the hsp genes, the g-box motif, and, in addition, a tg-box motif , have been identified. for a set of  <dig> genes, a putative tfbm containing the core sequence "acaca" has also been identified. in the upstream regions of  <dig> chloroquine responsive genes, a significantly over-represented gagagaa motif has been identified  <cit> . the motif formed specific rna-protein, but not dna-protein complexes, suggesting that it was regulating gene expression at the rna level. phylogenetic footprinting techniques have been integrated with techniques for detecting over-represented motifs, to identify tfbms or cis-regulatory motifs in pf  <cit> . upstream regions of co-expressed pf genes, together with the upstream regions of their orthologs in p. y. yoelii, have been considered, and alignace has been used to find over-represented motifs in the mixed set of sequences. the conservation of cis-regulatory motifs among different species has been exploited for motif detection. however, only  <dig> putative regulatory motifs have been identified. most pf genes were shown to have 4– <dig> of these regulatory elements in their upstream regions. the hypothesis has been made that each gene is regulated by multiple factors, with different combinations of factors being used to obtain the variety of expression profiles observed in the pf life-cycle. recently, a new algorithm called gene enrichment motif searching  has been developed which has the ability to identify high-confidence, cis-regulatory elements in genomes such as those of pf, which have a skewed nucleotide composition and are rich in repeat sequences  <cit> . the algorithm has been applied to the promoter regions of genes occurring in  <dig> functionally related, co-expressed clusters, generated from pf life-cycle microarray data by semi-supervised clustering;  <dig> putative cis-regulatory elements have been identified.

the asexual idc transcriptome of pf has previously been analysed and  <dig> functional groups of co-expressed genes have been listed  <cit> . in the present study, putative control elements in the upstream regions of each of these  <dig> sets of genes have been searched for. three motif searching programs have been used for the purpose: meme  <cit> , weeder  <cit>  and alignace  <cit> . these programs identify statistically over-represented motifs in a given set of upstream sequences. a short motif that occurs more frequently in a given set of sequences than expected, based on its frequency of occurrence in the genome, is said to be over-represented. the rationale behind looking for over-represented motifs is that, in eukaryotes, transcription-related regulatory motifs are repeated many times in the upstream regions, and multiple copies of the motif are correlated with transcriptional activity  <cit> . thus, methods developed for the de novo identification of regulatory motifs are based on the premise that statistically over-represented motifs are likely to be of biological significance. studies correlating over-represented upstream motifs with gene expression levels, in saccharomyces cerevisiae, have given validity to this assumption  <cit> . the over-represented motifs identified in this study would be putative regulatory elements and their actual significance would have to be experimentally determined.

the present study differs from the study by young et al. in  <cit>  in several ways. while, in the present study, over-represented motifs identified by  <dig> motif-discovery programs have been compared in order to identify reliable motifs, in  <cit> , a new method  has been developed to identify regulatory motifs. the dataset of co-expressed gene clusters also differs in the  <dig> studies . in the present study, as a result of examining the promoter regions of gene clusters expressed in the 48-hour pf idc, it has been possible to identify combinations of putative regulatory motifs that might be controlling gene co-expression in each stage transition in the cycle. also, in the present study, putative regulatory elements have been identified for organellar genes . regulatory elements identified for the organellar genes have also been compared with those identified for the cytoplasmic genes. other differences between the  <dig> studies are discussed below.

RESULTS
in the asexual idc transcriptome of pf, it has been shown that cellular processes take place in an orderly, programmed and continuous cascade, and that functionally related genes along this cascade show similar expression profiles  <cit> . table s <dig>  in  <cit> , lists  <dig> groups of nuclear encoded genes, each group consisting of functionally related genes that share a common expression profile; the expression data or profile for genes in each group is also given. pearson correlation values were calculated for all pairs of gene expression profiles in each group; the average value for each group is given in table 1; the values range from  <dig>  to  <dig> , indicating good correlation between the expression profiles of genes in each group. each group may, therefore, be looked upon as a set of co-expressed genes. the groups of genes being functionally related and co-expressed, the chances are greater that they are co-regulated; this makes it meaningful to search for regulatory motifs in the upstream regions of the groups of genes.

a the groups of functionally related genes have been arranged in the order in which they are expressed in the pf idc.

b the number of genes  in each functional group.

c the number of upstream regions in the group that are <  <dig> nt in length; for example, in the transcription machinery group,  <dig> upstream regions out of  <dig> are <  <dig> nt in length.

d the expression profile for each gene in each group has been given in reference  <cit> . pearson correlation values were calculated for all pairs of profiles in each group. the average of all pairwise pearson values in the group is given in the table.

e strong motif groups  identified in the upstream regions of each functional group.

in table  <dig>  the  <dig> groups of functionally related genes have been arranged in the order in which they have been presented in  <cit> , which is the order in which they appear in the pf idc. the  <dig> hour pf idc consists of the morphological stages of ring, trophozoite, schizont and merozoite. induction of large numbers of genes occurs in the ring to early trophozoite transition, in the trophozoite to early schizont transition, during the mid- and late-schizont stages, and during the early ring stage. the functional groups induced during these  <dig> transitions are listed in table  <dig>  the results of the present study have been discussed keeping this order of appearance of the functional groups in mind.

the aim of the study was to search the upstream regions of each set of functionally related, co-expressed genes, in the pf idc, for conserved, regulatory motifs which might be responsible for the co-ordinate expression of the set of genes. upstream regions have been considered on only one dna strand, the strand on which each gene was encoded; ≤ <dig> nt upstream of the translational start site  of each gene have been considered for motif searching . all sequences used and motifs presented in this study are in the 5'- to 3'-orientation. in the literature, many methods have become available for the task of motif discovery. a comparative assessment of  <dig> of them has been carried out  <cit>  and it has been recommended that multiple tools, rather than a single one, be used to search for motifs, because different tools, based on different algorithms, predict slightly different motifs, and, therefore, cover over-represented motif space better. it has also been recommended that the top few predicted motifs be considered, rather than the top most one alone. in the present study, therefore,  <dig> motif discovery programs, meme, alignace and weeder, have been used to search for over-represented motifs, and several of the top-scoring motifs have been considered. meme and alignace were selected because they have been used in previous studies aimed at identifying regulatory sequences in the pf genome  <cit> . the weeder program was selected because, in the study in  <cit> , it outperformed other programs by most of the measures used.

in order to check the sequences being used, and the computations, an attempt was made to retrieve the g-box regulatory element that had previously been identified  <cit> . the upstream regions  of the  <dig> hsp genes considered in the study, were extracted, and the alignace program, with previously reported parameters, was used for motif searching. the g-box motif was retrieved, and a comparison of the results obtained with those given in the paper showed that the sequences being used in this study, and the computations, were right.

results of motif searching in the upstream regions of  <dig> groups of co-expressed pf genes
the  <dig> motif-discovery programs, meme, weeder and alignace, were used to search for over-represented motifs in the upstream regions of each of the  <dig> sets of functionally related, co-expressed pf genes. a total of  <dig> motif-sets were identified by the  <dig> programs in the  <dig> sets of upstream regions, and there were a total of  <dig> motif occurrences in these motif-sets . the  <dig> motif-sets were grouped together  to form  <dig> motif groups, out of which  <dig> were regarded as strong motif groups , because they included related motif-sets that had been identified by more than one motif-discovery program . these  <dig> strong motif groups were formed by grouping together  <dig> out of  <dig> motif-sets, and included  <dig> motif occurrences. additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> show the  <dig> motif groups identified in the  <dig> sets of upstream regions; strong and weak motif groups, and all motif-sets, motif occurrences and sequence logos are shown. additional file  <dig> shows the motif groups identified for the  <dig> sets of genes expressed during the ring to early trophozoite transition , additional file  <dig> shows the motif groups identified for the  <dig> sets of genes expressed during the trophozoite to early schizont transition, and, similarly, additional files  <dig> and  <dig> show motif groups identified for the  <dig> and  <dig> sets of genes expressed during the schizont and early ring stages, respectively. the  <dig> strong motif groups are labeled as 'strong motifs' in the figures.

the motif-sets are related and together constitute a strong motif group.

given, for each motif in a set, are: the gene name, the motif that was identified in the upstream region of the gene, the position of the motif in the upstream region, and, sometimes, an *, which indicates that the motif overlaps with motif occurrences in one or more of the other motif-sets; at the top of each motif-set, a consensus sequence for the set is given; each motif-set has been used to obtain a sequence logo which is shown in figure 1; all motifs in the table occur on the forward strand.

an examination of the  <dig> strong motif groups showed that there were only  <dig> unique motifs, and that none, some or all  <dig> of them appeared as over-represented motifs in the upstream regions of the  <dig> sets of genes. the  <dig> motifs have been referred to, in the present study, as the g-rich motif, the c-rich motif, the caca motif and the tgtg motif; examples of these motifs are shown in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the g-rich motif has a core sequence consisting of  <dig> to  <dig> gs , the c-rich motif has a core sequence consisting of  <dig> to  <dig> cs , the caca motif has the caca core sequence and the tgtg motif has a core sequence of more than one tg pair . the motif groups  occurring in the upstream regions of each of the  <dig> sets of genes are given in table  <dig> 

three of the four motifs  have previously been identified  <cit> . the c-rich motif has been identified as an over-represented motif by the meme program alone, for the set of mitochondrial genes ; it has, nevertheless, been regarded as a strong motif because it occurs in most of the genes in the set. the g-rich motif has previously been shown to be a regulatory element  for the pf hsp genes  <cit> . in the present study, g-rich motifs have been identified in the upstream regions of several sets of genes, other than the hsp group, suggesting that they are not limited to the latter group. interestingly, in eukaryotes, cis-regulatory elements, called g-strings, consisting of runs of only gs on one strand and only cs on the other, have been found to appear frequently in the upstream regions of genes that do not contain tata boxes, initiator elements or ccaat boxes  <cit> . pf upstream regions, which often lack these latter elements, are thus ideally suited to host g-strings or g-rich motifs. the caca motif has previously been identified in a putative tfbm  <cit> . in the present study, it is conspicuously absent in the upstream regions of functional groups expressed during the ring to early trophozoite transition . the caca and tgtg motifs identified, in this study, are not microsatellites. while in mammalian genomes, n repeats occur as microsatellites, in pf, n and n repeats do not do so; instead, n, n and n repeats occur as microsatellites  <cit> . if at the start of the study, one had hoped to find one unique upstream motif, per co-expressed, functional group, that would explain why genes in the group were concomitantly turned on, one was certainly disappointed. instead, a total of only  <dig> putative regulatory motifs were identified in the  <dig> sets, and  <dig> to all  <dig> of these motifs were found to appear in the upstream regions of each set. this is in consonance with the suggestion made previously  <cit>  that, while pf may have a small number of regulators and regulatory sequences, as compared to other eukaryotes, it uses them in a combinatorial way to bring about the required level of diversity in gene expression. it is also closer to the situation where a unique motif or a unique combination of motifs per transition, would explain why sets of genes specific to that transition were concomitantly turned on.

in order to check if the strong motifs identified in table  <dig> were significant, statistical validation of the motifs was carried out, as described under methods. the upstream sequences of each set of genes were shuffled  <dig> times to obtain  <dig> sets of shuffled sequences, and motif-searching by all  <dig> programs was carried out on all  <dig> sets. meme, in  <dig> runs, did not identify any over-represented motif, in any set of shuffled sequences, obtained from any set of upstream sequences. thus, over-represented motifs identified by meme in the original sets of upstream sequences were significant because they were not picked in any of the randomized sequences. alignace identified no over-represented motifs in  <dig> out of  <dig> runs. in the remaining  <dig> runs,  <dig> motifs were identified. all motifs, however, were random ones because their map scores were poor . weeder runs  did not identify the motifs presented in this study. considering that motifs presented in the study were each usually identified by multiple programs, and that they were not identified in the randomized sequences, one can conclude with confidence that the motifs are significant.

the pf genome is the most at-rich  genome to have been sequenced to date; it has an overall gc-content of  <dig> %, with the gc-content of exons being higher, at  <dig> %, and that of intergenic regions being lower, at  <dig> %  <cit> . given the low overall gc-content, one would expect that the usage of gc in the genome would not be wasteful, and that g-c containing sequences would primarily be restricted to critical regions. consistent with this, exons have a significantly higher gc-content than intergenic regions. in the upstream regions of genes , if gc-containing motifs are over-represented, it would be reasonable to expect that such motifs are important and, perhaps, have a regulatory role, because gc is sparingly used in the genome. in the present study, therefore, greater significance has been attached to over-represented, gc-containing motifs. over-represented at-rich motifs  have largely been ignored because, owing to the high at-content of the genome, these motifs were not likely to be unique to particular sets of co-expressed genes.

the caca and tgtg motifs , identified in the present study, although they are partly complementary in sequence, have been regarded as  <dig> different motifs, and not as the same motif occurring on opposite strands. this is because, motif-searching was carried out on single-stranded upstream sequences , and the tgtg and caca motifs that were picked were not from complementary strands. further, when a regulatory motif is not palindromic , the cognate protein is likely to bind in a different orientation  to, for example, a caca motif on the coding strand, as compared to a caca motif on the non-coding strand. moreover, motif-searching programs, too, when run in single or double-stranded modes, report complementary motifs as separate motifs. thus, tgtg and caca motifs  deserved to be treated as distinct motifs because distinct tfs were likely to recognize them.

positional conservation of motif occurrences in the upstream regions
the motif occurrences in the  <dig> strong motif groups, identified in the upstream regions of the  <dig> sets of genes, were sorted  and then visualized using feature maps . an interesting feature observed in some of the feature maps was that, in subsets of gene upstream regions, there was a preferential positioning of motifs relative to the tls ; i.e., motifs show a preference to occur at a particular upstream position relative to the start of translation. in the literature, this has been referred to as 'positional bias', and tfbms are known to display such a bias or preference  <cit> . in  <cit> , 'positional enrichment' of motifs relative to the start codon has been noted for some clusters of pf genes , and the enrichment has been regarded as an indication that the motif is functionally important.

in the present study, positional bias or enrichment of a motif, relative to the tls, has been referred to as 'positional conservation', and the latter has been regarded as an indication that the motif is important and, perhaps, plays a regulatory role. putative regulatory motifs identified in the upstream sequences of each of the  <dig> sets of genes have been listed in additional file  <dig>  to identify sets of motifs which show positional conservation, the upstream region  has been divided into windows of width  <dig> nt and the number of motifs occurring in each window, and also the number of sequences showing motifs in the window, have been counted from additional file  <dig>  positional conservation seen in a window has been considered to be statistically significant if the probability of obtaining the observed  number of motifs, and the observed  number of sequences with motifs, in that window, by chance , was less than  <dig>  . thus, positionally conserved motifs presented in the study have been statistically validated. further, instances of positional conservation have been discussed only when  <dig> or more motifs, and  <dig> or more sequences with motifs, occurred in a window. details for the statistically validated, positionally conserved motifs are given in additional file  <dig>  and the motifs are highlighted in color in additional file  <dig> 

an attempt has also been made to examine if some of the positionally conserved motifs play a regulatory role at the transcriptional  or at the post-transcriptional  level. this has been done by retrieving the ests for the upstream sequences of the sets of genes, and searching for the putative regulatory motifs in the ests . as ests contain extensions to the 5' end of the target mrna, one can try to search for regulatory motifs in these additional sequence stretches. the presence of regulatory motifs occurring at or upstream of ~- <dig>  in the ests of several upstream sequences of a set of genes, at the appropriate position with respect to the est start codon, has been taken to suggest that the motifs may be playing a regulatory role at the rna level . further, regulatory motifs identified for some sets of pf genes have also been searched for in the upstream sequences of orthologous genes from other plasmodium species . the appearance of positionally conserved pf motifs in the upstream sequences of 'in genera' orthologs gives considerable validity to the identified putative regulatory motifs.

interesting observations made for the  <dig> sets of upstream regions are described below. the strong motifs identified for the  <dig> sets, and the positional conservation information for the motifs, are summarized in additional file  <dig>  this file also indicates the relevant figures, tables and additional files that the reader may turn to, while following the discussion below. while referring to additional files, the slide number has been mentioned; thus, af-1: <dig> refers to the 9th slide in additional file  <dig>  negative numbers have been used to indicate motif positions; - <dig>  for example, refers to a position  <dig> nt upstream from the tls.

 transcription machinery genes
a g-rich motif group has been identified as a strong motif for this set of genes . the majority of 4g and 3g motifs occur upstream of - <dig> 

 cytoplasmic translation machinery genes
this is a large functional group consisting of  <dig> genes. g-rich, c-rich and tgtg motif groups have been identified as strong motif groups for this set of genes; all  <dig> motifs show positional conservation . the majority of 4g and 3g motifs occur upstream of - <dig>  suggesting that these motifs tend to occur away from the tls. 4c motifs also tend to occur upstream of - <dig>  tgtg motif occurrences are small in number. in  <cit> , an upstream ccctta motif was identified for a cytosolic ribosome cluster , and the motif was found to be positionally enriched between - <dig> and - <dig>  this motif has, however, been regarded as the approximate reverse complement of the g-box motif   <cit> .  <dig> genes are common between the cluster in  <cit>  and the present cluster. here, c-rich and g-rich motifs have been reported; positionally conserved 4c motifs have been observed at ~- <dig> 

 glycolytic pathway
a g-rich motif was identified as a strong motif for this set, but no positional conservation was observed . the latter was surprising because genes in the set are tightly coregulated  <cit> . this set of genes is thought to be post-transcriptionally regulated because a delay is observed between mrna accumulation and protein expression  <cit> . therefore, regulatory motifs at the transcriptional level may be less important.

ribonucleotide synthesis genes
a g-rich motif appears as a strong motif in the upstream regions of this set . distinct positional conservation is observed at ~- <dig>  where  <dig> 4g,  <dig> 3g,  <dig> 2g and  <dig> 1g motifs occur . positional conservation is also observed at ~- <dig>  - <dig>  and at ~- <dig> . all 4g motifs, and all except  <dig> 3g motifs occur upstream of - <dig>  thus, distinctly positionally conserved g-rich motifs are observed for this set of genes. the g-rich motifs were also searched for in the ests retrieved for the upstream sequences of this set of genes. motifs occurring at - <dig> or - <dig>  with respect to the est start codon, were not observed in any of the ests . this would suggest that the motif plays a regulatory role at the transcriptional  level, and not at the post-transcriptional  level. the g-rich motifs  were also searched for in the upstream sequences of orthologs of this set of genes in other plasmodium species. oddly, the g-rich motifs occurred infrequently in the upstream sequences of the orthologous genes . this would suggest that the motifs are unique to the upstream sequences of this set of genes in pf.

 deoxynucleotide synthesis
no strong upstream motif was identified for this set, even though it is a tightly co-expressed set .

 dna replication machinery
 <dig> strong motifs were identified for this set of genes – the caca, the tgtg, the g-rich, and the  c-rich motifs . the caca motif  shows positional conservation at ~- <dig>  and at ~- <dig> and - <dig> . the latter  <dig> sets of motifs are interesting but statistically weakly significant, p <  <dig>  and p <  <dig> , respectively. caca motifs were searched for in the ests retrieved for the upstream sequences of this set of genes . in the ests for  <dig> upstream sequences, upstream caca motifs  were identified. thus, in the ests of  <dig> of these upstream sequences, positionally conserved upstream motifs  were observed. owing to this latter observation, one has to admit the possibility that the caca motif plays a regulatory role at the rna or post-transcriptional level. the caca motifs were also searched for in the upstream sequences of orthologs of this set of genes in other plasmodium species. the motif is clearly observed in the upstream sequences, occurring, more frequently, between - <dig> and - <dig> . the occurrence of the motif in the upstream sequences of 'in genera' orthologs gives considerable validity to the motif being a regulatory motif. tgtg motifs occur between - <dig> and - <dig> and between - <dig> and - <dig>  the g-rich motif includes a significant number of 2g and 1g  motif occurrences ; in comparison, 4g and 3g occurrences are fewer, and all of them, except  <dig> 4g and  <dig> 3g motifs, occur upstream of - <dig>  in  <cit> , for the cluster of  <dig> dna replication and chromosome cycle genes , an upstream ntgtgtga motif was identified. it has been pointed out that this motif is observed for a large group of genes expressed during the middle to later stages of the idc and that it may play a role in the regulation of the group. in agreement with this, in the present study, the tgtg motif was observed in most groups of genes expressed during the trophozoite/early schizont and schizont stages . in addition to the tgtg motif, an interesting caca motif has been identified for this set of genes, which may be functioning at the rna level.

 tca cycle
a g-rich motif was identified as a strong motif for this set of genes . 4g, 3g and 2g motifs did not show positional conservation.

 proteasome
the strong motifs identified for this set were the caca, the g-rich and the tgtg motifs . the caca motif showed distinct positional conservation between ~- <dig> and - <dig>  and between - <dig> and - <dig>  . while the caca motifs in the upstream regions of the dna replication machinery genes occur closer to the tls , the caca motifs for this set of genes occur further upstream from the tls . caca motifs were searched for in the ests retrieved for the upstream sequences of this set of genes . in the ests for  <dig> proteasome upstream sequences, motifs matching upstream caca motifs  were observed. in none of the ests, however, were positionally conserved caca motifs occurring at ~- <dig> identified. this would suggest a regulatory role for the motif at the transcriptional  level. the caca motifs  were also searched for in the upstream sequences of 'in genera' orthologs of this set of genes. motifs were observed between - <dig> and ~- <dig> in many sequences, and further upstream in others; some positional conservation was also observed . the g-rich motifs – 4g+3g – show some positional conservation. the tgtg motif occurs as the variant, tgtatg. in  <cit> , for the cluster of  <dig> proteasome complex genes , no upstream motif was identified. in the present study,  <dig> motifs were identified.

 mitochondrial genes
this set of genes, encoded on the nuclear genome, generates protein products that have to travel to the mitochondrion of the parasite. the genes have to be expressed together, in order that their protein products may arrive together at the mitochondrion. one might, therefore, expect to find regulatory motifs which coordinate the temporal co-expression of this set of genes.  <dig> strong motifs have been identified for the set – the c-rich, the g-rich and the tgtg motifs . the c-rich motif  was identified by meme, alone. figure  <dig>  which shows the locations of 4c+3c+2c motifs, shows that there is distinct positional conservation of motifs at ~- <dig>  and at ~- <dig> . the striking positional conservation, together with the fact that the number of motif occurrences is limited to at most  <dig> per gene, suggests that the motif may have a significant regulatory role. the c-rich motifs were further searched for in the  <dig> ests retrieved for the upstream sequences of this set of genes . in a single est for one upstream sequence, a positionally conserved upstream motif  was observed. more evidence than this would be needed to suggest that the c-rich motif plays a regulatory role at the post-transcriptional  rather than the transcriptional  level. the c-rich motifs, listed in additional file  <dig>  were searched for in the upstream sequences of 'in genera' orthologs of this set of genes. impressively, motifs were observed between - <dig> and -600; they were also observed further upstream and between - <dig> and - <dig> . the occurrence of the motif in orthologous upstream sequences provides considerable support for the motif as a regulatory motif. the g-rich motif – 4g+3g+2g+1g – showed positional conservation between ~- <dig> and - <dig> . out of  <dig> 4g motifs, one occurs at - <dig> and one occurs at - <dig>  tgtg motifs occurred between - <dig> and - <dig> . the  <dig> motifs, individually or together, appear to play a regulatory role, because most of the occurrences of all  <dig> motifs lie between - <dig> and - <dig> and are suitably positioned to function as tfbms.

 organellar translation machinery
this set of genes codes for components of the apicoplast and/or mitochondrial translation machinery. the genes are nuclear encoded but the proteins travel to the apicoplast or mitochondrion. strong motifs identified for the set were the g-rich, c-rich and tgtg motifs . figure  <dig> shows that g-rich motifs are quite numerous: there are  <dig> 4g,  <dig> 3g and  <dig> 2g motifs. positional conservation is observed close to the tls, at ~- <dig> . while in most other groups of genes, 4g and  3g motifs usually occur upstream of - <dig> , in this group, 4g and 3g motifs frequently occur between - <dig> and - <dig>  thus, the number and location of g-rich motifs is uncharacteristic in this set of genes. tgtg motifs also show positional conservation . c-rich motifs, in this set, in comparison with the mitochondrial genes, are more numerous , but do show positional conservation at ~- <dig>  this set of genes shows homology to components of the cytoplasmic translation machinery  <cit> . interestingly, the strong motifs identified for both sets of genes are the same ; motif occurrences in the upstream regions of the  <dig> sets, however, show differences. in the organellar translation machinery set, g-rich motifs occur closer to the tls, while in the cytoplasmic translation machinery set, they occur further upstream ; in the former, tgtg motifs are more numerous and show positional conservation, while in the latter, occurrences of the motif are far fewer ; tgtg and c-rich motifs tend to occur further upstream in the latter as compared to the former; finally, in the former, upstream regions are shorter as compared to the latter. the differences may be regulatory cues that ensure that the  <dig> sets of genes are turned on at different time points in the idc. they may also be a reflection of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic origins of the  <dig> sets of genes.

g-rich and tgtg motifs were searched for in the  <dig> ests retrieved for the upstream sequences of this set of genes . considering that many g-rich motifs occur close to the tls, and that motifs occurring close to the tls  are more likely to be transcribed into the ests, it was surprising to find only a small number of upstream motifs in the ests. for the upstream sequence, pf14_ <dig>   <dig> interesting ests were found; each est had the start codon and  <dig> upstream g-rich motifs . altogether, in the ests of only  <dig> and  <dig> upstream sequences, out of  <dig>  respectively, were upstream g-rich and tgtg motifs found, respectively. only upstream motifs occurring close to the tls  were observed in the ests. more evidence would be needed to suggest that the g-rich and tgtg motifs observed for this set of genes play a regulatory role at the post-transcriptional level. the g-rich and tgtg motifs  were also searched for in the upstream sequences of 'in genera' orthologs of this set of genes. in contrast to the considerable number of g-rich motifs observed in the pf upstream sequences, few motifs were observed in the orthologous upstream sequences; an indication, perhaps, that the g-rich motifs were unique to the pf upstream sequences. tgtg motifs were observed in the orthologous upstream sequences. they occurred between - <dig> and - <dig> where positionally conserved pf upstream motifs also occur .

 merozoite invasion genes
 <dig> strong motifs – tgcaca , tgtg, c-rich, g-rich – were identified for this set . the four motifs do not show striking patterns of positional conservation. g-rich motifs tend to occur upstream of - <dig> 

 actin myosin motors
this is a tightly co-expressed group of genes . strong motifs identified for this group were the tgcaca motif, the g-rich motif and the tgtg motif . the motifs did not show distinct patterns of positional conservation. most 4g and 3g motifs occurred upstream of -400; several tgtg motifs occurred between - <dig> and - <dig> 

 early ring transcript genes
strong motifs were not identified for this set, perhaps, because the genes are post-transcriptionally regulated  <cit> .

discussion
the study by young et al.  <cit>  and the present study have both used computational methods to identify putative regulatory motifs in the upstream regions of co-expressed genes in the pf life-cycle. the co-expressed gene clusters for which regulatory motifs have been identified, however, differ in the  <dig> studies . for the cytoplasmic translation machinery, dna replication machinery and proteasome clusters, however, there is some overlap of genes in the  <dig> studies. in the present study, for each of the first  <dig> of these clusters, several putative regulatory motifs have been identified, including a motif similar to the one in  <cit> ; for the proteasome cluster,  <dig> motifs were identified in the present study , while none were identified in  <cit> .

the search, in the present study, for over-represented motifs in the upstream regions of  <dig> functional groups of co-expressed genes, in the 48-hour pf idc, yielded several interesting results.  <dig> main motifs were identified by the methods used, and they have been referred to as the g-rich, the c-rich, the caca and the tgtg motifs. zero to all four of these motifs occur in the upstream regions of each of the  <dig> sets of genes. motifs, similar to these  <dig>  have previously been identified for different sets of genes  <cit> . in this study, combinations of putative regulatory motifs have been identified for co-expressed sets of genes in the stage transitions of the 48-hour pf idc. it has previously been suggested that, rather than a large variety of cis-regulatory motifs, different combinations of a small number of motifs regulate gene expression in pf  <cit> . it is further suggested here that the combination of regulatory motifs tends to be more similar for functional groups of genes expressed in the same transition . an examination of the occurrences of each motif in the upstream regions of the relevant group of genes showed that, for some motifs, the occurrences were positionally conserved in subsets of genes; i.e., in subsets of genes, motifs occurred at similar upstream positions with respect to the tls, even when the genes in the subset were present on different chromosomes. the observed positional conservation enhances the significance of the over-represented motifs identified by the motif discovery programs, and suggests that the motifs may have a regulatory role. in  <cit> , 'positional enrichment' of motifs relative to the start codon has been noted for some clusters of pf genes. in the present study, the observed positional conservation has been shown to be statistically significant.

additional file  <dig> lists putative regulatory motifs  discussed in the text. the table would be useful to experimentalists looking for transcription regulatory elements in the pf genome. some striking examples of positional conservation were observed. in the ribonucleotide synthesis group, distinct positional conservation of g-rich motifs was observed, with the motifs almost occurring in columns . in the set of mitochondrial genes, the c-rich motif occurs with striking positional conservation at - <dig> . in the proteasome set of genes, the caca motif shows striking positional conservation at ~- <dig> and - <dig> ; on the other hand, in the dna replication machinery genes, the caca motif occurs closer to the tls . in all functional groups, except the organellar translation machinery group, 4g- and  3g-containing g-rich motifs tended to occur upstream of -400; in the organellar translation machinery group, 4g and 3g motifs frequently occurred between - <dig> and - <dig> ; thus, the position of g-rich motifs is unusual in this set of genes. the organellar translation machinery and mitochondrial genes are nuclear encoded but are of prokaryotic origin; their protein products are slated for and function in the mitochondrion and apicoplast, organelles of prokaryotic origin. the c-rich motif occurring upstream of the mitochondrial genes, and the uncharacteristically positioned g-rich motifs occurring upstream of the organellar translation machinery genes, perhaps, help to ensure that these genes are expressed in a timely fashion, in order that their protein products may travel to their destination, outside the nucleus.

as separate cytoplasmic and organellar translation machinery gene co-expression clusters, occurring at different time points in the pf idc, are observed , it has been possible, in the present study, to make a comparison of the putative regulatory motifs in the upstream regions of these  <dig> sets of genes. the upstream regions tend to be longer in the former as compared to the latter. the g-rich, the tgtg and the c-rich motifs were identified as over-represented for both sets of genes . the locations of the motifs, however, differ in the  <dig> sets of genes. g-rich motifs in the former usually occur upstream of - <dig>  while in the latter they frequently occur between - <dig> and -400; tgtg motifs are not numerous in the former but are numerous in the latter; tgtg and c-rich motifs tend to occur further upstream in the former as compared to the latter. thus, presumably, the control mechanisms differ for the  <dig> sets of genes, even though the latter set shows homology to the former  <cit> . this is necessary, too, because the  <dig> sets of genes are expressed at different time points in the pf idc .

in  <cit> , the g-box motif  <cit>  has been regarded as the complement of the cccctta motif and it has been suggested that the motif may be associated with highly expressed trophozoite-specific metabolic genes. further, the ntgtgtga motif has been observed for a large group of genes expressed during the middle to later stages of the idc  <cit> . in the present study, too, tgtg, c-rich and g-rich motifs are observed for many clusters of genes in the idc . however, the combination of motifs is more similar for clusters in a transition . further, the caca motif appears not to be over-represented only in the upstream regions of genes expressed in the ring to early trophozoite transition. the presence of the motif may ensure that genes with the motif are not turned on during this transition. the motif is over-represented in the upstream regions of sets of genes expressed in the trophozoite to early schizont transition , and also in the schizont stage, where modified caca motifs  are over-represented.

an attempt has been made to examine if some of the positionally conserved motifs might be playing a regulatory role at the post-transcriptional level. putative regulatory motifs were searched for in the ests retrieved for the upstream sequences of sets of genes. upstream g-rich motifs  and caca motifs  identified for the ribonucleotide synthesis and proteasome sets of genes, respectively, were not found in the ests; this would suggest that these motifs play a regulatory role not at the rna, but at the dna level. upstream caca motifs  identified for the dna replication machinery set were observed in the ests, admitting the possibility that the motifs play a role at the post-transcriptional level. while some positionally conserved upstream motifs were observed in the ests for the mitochondrial and organellar translation machinery sets of upstream sequences, more evidence would be needed to suggest that the motifs play a role at the rna level. in general, among the motifs observed in the ests, upstream motifs occurring close to the tls were the most common while those occurring further upstream  were rare. upstream motifs at ~- <dig> and above were never observed in the ests.

in order to validate some of the positionally conserved motifs identified for sets of pf genes, the motifs have been searched for in the upstream sequences of orthologous genes from other plasmodium species. upstream caca motifs for the dna replication machinery and proteasome sets of genes, c-rich motifs for the mitochondrial genes and tgtg motifs for the organellar translation machinery genes were all observed in the orthologous upstream sequences, sometimes at positions at which positionally conserved motifs were observed in pf. these observations lend considerable validity to these motifs being regulatory motifs. oddly, g-rich motifs for the ribonucleotide synthesis and organellar translation machinery sets of genes were not observed in orthologous upstream sequences from other plasmodium species. since g-rich motifs for two sets of genes were not observed, it is possible that the occurrence of these motifs, in these sets of genes, is unique to pf.

some motif occurrences, in the present study, show positional conservation at positions ranging from - <dig> to - <dig> while others show conservation between - <dig> and - <dig>  one might speculate that motifs occurring at the former positions constitute tfbms  <cit> , while those occurring at the latter positions probably constitute upstream enhancer elements. in the ribonucleotide synthesis, proteasome, mitochondrial, organellar translation machinery and dna replication machinery sets of genes, positionally conserved upstream motifs were observed. many of the upstream sequences in these sets are <  <dig> nt in length , ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> nt. given the positional conservation of motifs, one is led to speculate that these sets of genes are transcriptionally regulated. to conclude, it is felt that, by looking for positional conservation of motif occurrences, a way has been found to gain more insight into regulatory elements that might be responsible for transcriptional regulation in pf. if experimental approaches were to be used to evaluate the positionally conserved motifs identified in the present study, the functional groups on which efforts could be focused would be the ribonucleotide synthesis, mitochondrial, organellar translation machinery, proteasome and dna replication machinery groups.

CONCLUSIONS
the study identifies positionally conserved, over-represented motifs in the upstream regions of functionally related, co-expressed pf genes. positional conservation with respect to the tls, observed even for genes located on different chromosomes, increases the significance of some of the identified over-represented motifs. the positionally conserved arrangement of motifs in the upstream regions of some sets of genes  suggests a regulatory role for the motifs which may include control of co-expression of the sets of genes. further, for the different sets of genes expressed in a transition, the observed combination of upstream motifs tends to be similar; this may be a regulatory mechanism for co-ordinating the expression of sets of genes that are expressed in the transition. thus, the study throws light on regulatory elements for transcription in the pf idc. the identified motifs may be regarded as useful hypotheses for experimentally probing transcriptional regulation of gene co-expression in pf.
