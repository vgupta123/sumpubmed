BACKGROUND
small rnas, in particular, 20- to 24-nucleotide  in length, belong to two classes: micrornas  and short interfering rnas . mirnas are regulators of gene expression and affect many biological processes, such as development and physiology in plants and animals  <cit> . their dysregulation often causes developmental defects and diseases of plants and animals. mirnas are released as a duplex from an imperfect step-loop, which resides in the mirna primary transcripts   <cit> . sirnas are chemically indistinguishable with mirnas but they originate from long perfect double-stranded rnas   <cit> . plants encode several classes of sirnas including sirnas derived from repetitive dnas  and transacting sirnas   <cit> . ra-sirnas regulate gene expression at transcriptional levels by directing dna methylation at homologs loci through a process named rna-directed dna methylation   <cit> . in contrast, ta-sirnas act like mirnas to regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional levels  <cit> . the framework of plant mirna/sirna biogenesis and function has been established in arabidopsis thaliana ; several different categories of genes are involved in the pathways for their generations and loading.

in arabidopsis, the generation of mirnas and sirnas requires the dicer-like proteins   <cit> . dcls are the rnaase iii enzymes that cut the dsrnas to release ~  <dig> nt rna duplexes, which have  <dig> nt 3′ overhangs at each end  <cit> . arabidopsis encodes four dcls: dcl <dig>  dcl <dig>  dcl <dig>  and dcl <dig>  dcl <dig>  which associates with hyl <dig>  a dsrna binding protein, and serrate , a zinc protein, cuts pri-mirnas two times to release  <dig> nt mirna duplex in nucleus  <cit> . dcl <dig> is responsible for  <dig> nt viral-derived sirnas when plants are infected  <cit> . dcl <dig> generates  <dig> nt ra-sirnas and dcl <dig> produces  <dig> nt ta-sirnas and some mirnas  <cit> . the generation of both mirnas and sirnas also requires the single-stranded rna -binding proteins dawdle and tough  <cit> . after generation, mirna and sirna duplexes are 2′–o-methylated at 3′-terminal nucleotide by a dsrna methylase hen <dig>  <cit> . the methylation protects mirnas from degradation and 3′ untemplated uridine addition  <cit> . the arabidopsis hasty  gene is an ortholog of the human exportin  <dig> gene. after generation, mirnas are exported to cytoplasm by hst-dependent or independent pathways  <cit> , where they function. interestingly, some components of mirna biogenesis pathway are also targets of mirnas. for example, in soybean, mir <dig> can target dcl <dig> and leads to hypernodulation  <cit> .

rna-dependent rna polymerase  is another essential player for sirna production. among six rdrs in arabidopsis, rdr <dig> converts ssrnas generated from repetitive dnas to precursor dsrnas of ra-sirnas  <cit> , while rdr <dig> produces the ta-sirna precursors  <cit> . the generation of ra-sirna also requires a plant specific dna-dependent rna polymerase iv   <cit> . pol iv is a pol ii-derived plant specific polymerase. it contains many identical subunits of pol ii  <cit> , but the largest subunit nrpd <dig> and the second largest subunit nrpd2/nrpe <dig> of pol iv are paralogous of their counterparts in pol ii  <cit> . over 90% sirnas require pol iv for their production  <cit> . pol iv is thought to transcribe ssrnas that serve as templates of rdr <dig> from rddm target loci  <cit> . another plant specific dna dependent rna polymerase v  also plays crucial roles in the rddm pathway  <cit> . pol v shares eight subunits with pol iv including nrpd2/nrpe <dig>  <cit> , while nrpe <dig>  and other three subunits are distinct from their counterparts in pol iv  <cit> . pol v associates with rddm target loci and produces ~ <dig> nt non-coding transcripts from surrounding regions of some rddm loci.

mirnas and sirnas are loaded onto the argonaute  proteins, which performs target mrna cleavage and/or translational inhibition, or directs chromatin modification such as dna methylation  <cit> . by recognizing the complementary sequences in the targets, mirna,s and sirnas guide ago to silence specific genes  <cit> . in general, there are multiple ago genes in a plant species. arabidopsis possesses  <dig> agos  <cit> , based on sequence similarities, which are grouped into three clades: ago <dig>  ago <dig> and ago <dig> belong to the first clades; ago <dig>  ago <dig> and ago <dig> compose the second clades; and ago <dig>  ago <dig>  ago <dig> and ago <dig> are within the third clades  <cit> . ago <dig> associates with mirnas and some sirnas such as ta-sirnas to cleave target mrna and/or inhibit translation  <cit> . ago <dig> specifically sequesters mir166/ <dig> from ago <dig>  which is essential for shoot apical meristem development  <cit> . ago <dig> binds mir <dig> to cleave the precursor rna of ta-sirnas  <cit> . ago <dig>  ago <dig>  and ago <dig> majorly bind  <dig> nt ra-sirnas to direct dna methylation  <cit> , but seem to have different target preference  <cit> . it has been proposed that pol v may recruit ago4-sirna complex to rddm targets though its physical interaction with ago <dig> and/or the interaction between its nascent transcripts and ago4/ <dig> associated sirnas  <cit> . recently,  <dig> and  <dig> agos were identified in rice and maize, respectively  <cit> .

in soybean and sorghum, our knowledge on rna silencing mechanism is still poor. taking advantage of available genome information and the conservation of rna silencing components in different plant species, in this study, putative rna silencing components, including dcl, hen <dig>  se, hyl <dig>  hst, rdr, nrpd <dig>  nrpd2/nrpe <dig>  nrpe <dig>  and ago, are identified in soybean and sorghum. the identification of these components could provide insight into rna silencing mechanism in soybean and sorghum as well as basis for further investigation.

RESULTS
dcls
the domains of dexd-helicase, helicase-c, duf <dig>  paz, rnase iii, and double-stranded rna-binding  are conserved in plant and animal dcls  <cit> . therefore, dcl genes in soybean and sorghum can be identified by searching genes whose proteins have these domains combined with a structure like dcls in arabidopsis. the protein domain identification was accomplished with hidden markov models . using hmm analysis to the whole genomes combined sequence similarity search with tblastn,  <dig> and  <dig> dcls were identified in soybean and sorghum, respectively . phylogenetic analysis assigns two dcl <dig>  two dcl <dig>  one dcl <dig>  two dcl <dig> in soybean and one dcl <dig>  two dcl <dig> in sorghum . these genes are named by using prefix gm  or sb  to reflect the species in which they are present and the numbers of their arabidopsis orthologs, for example gmdcl <dig> for soybean dcl <dig> gene. in this manuscript, prefix at  and os  are used for arabidopsis and rice, respectively. if there are more than one orthologs, a letter is attached according to the sequence similarity. for instance, the one having the highest similarity with their arabidopsis ortholog is designed as “a”. if two proteins are identical, they are named as “a” or “b” based on the order of chromosome location numbers: the gene is “a” if it is on the chromosome with a smaller number and the other is “b”. the same nomenclature is used for other rna silencing components described in the following sections. the hmm search failed to find dcl <dig> and dcl <dig> in sorghum annotated genes, and hence, tblastn was performed to search atdcl <dig> and atdcl <dig> protein sequences against the sorghum genome sequence. this approach identified the sbdcl <dig> from an unannotated region in the chromosome one. this locus is named as sb01g <dig> because it is located between loci sb01g <dig> and sb01g <dig>  the expression of sbdcl <dig> was confirmed by rt-pcr. no dcl <dig> homolog was identified by tblastn, but three predicted proteins, sb06g <dig>  sb06g <dig>  and sb06g <dig>  show similarities to different portions of atdcl <dig> from c-terminus to n-terminus. this indicates that these three predicted proteins might belong to one transcription unit. in fact, annotation to the region of these three genes predicts one transcript that encodes a  <dig> amino acid  long protein. this new predicted protein, named as sbdcl <dig>  has 63% and 83% similarities to atdcl <dig> and osdcl <dig>  respectively. the soybean dcl <dig>  dcl <dig>  and dcl <dig> have been duplicated once in the genome and there are high similarities between duplicates. in contrast, only dcl <dig> has duplicates in the sorghum genome. the gmdcls are more similar to atdcls than sbdcls do , presumably due to that both soybean and arabidopsis are dicot while sorghum is monocot. in fact, sbdcls are more similar to osdcls than to atdcls .



protein lengths were obtained from phytozome annotations, except sbdcl <dig> and sbdcl <dig>  whose protein lengths were predicted.

a dicer gene and its homologs always contain two rnaseiii domains, termed “a” and “b”, each of which cleaves one strand of a dsrna. the paz domain binds to the 3′-end of a dsrna  <cit> . the distance between the paz domain and the cleavage site of rnase iii domain determines the length of small rnas  <cit> . the domain duf <dig> is now known to be a dsrna-binding domain  <cit> . the protein domains present in soybean and sorghum dcls are similar to their counterparts in arabidopsis except some differences in dcl <dig> and dcl <dig>  the rnase iiia domain of sbdcl <dig> is divided into two segments, whereas it is present as an undivided domain in atdcl <dig>  duf <dig> exists in both soybean and sorghum dcl <dig> while it is absent in atdcl <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the combinations of dcl domains in soybean, sorghum, and arabidopsis.

hen <dig>  se, hyl <dig>  and hst
by searching athen <dig> protein sequence against soybean and sorghum genomes with tblastn, two soybean and one sorghum hen <dig> homologs were identified. soybean hen <dig> from chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> are named as gmhen1a and gmhen1b, respectively . the protein sequences of gmhen1a/b and sbhen <dig> have only 40-50% similarity with athen <dig>  the identical protein sequences of gmhen1a and 1b suggest a recent duplication event. like athen <dig>  gmhen1a/b, and sbhen <dig> contained two dsrna binding domains, a la-motif-containing domain , a ppiase-like domain , and a highly conserved methyltransferase   <cit> , which indicates that hen1s act on the mirna or sirna duplexes.



protein lengths were obtained from phytozome annotations.

soybean and sorghum genomes each encode three arabidopsis se homologs . atses have around 75% and 50-67% sequence similarities to gmses and sbses, respectively. same as atses, soybean and sorghum ses possess an n-terminal unstructured region followed by an n-terminal domain containing several nuclear localization signals, a middle-domain, a core zinc-finger domain, and a c-terminal unstructured region  <cit> . although similarities among gmses and among sbses are around 90%, their n-terminal unstructured regions  are not conserved, which is consistent with the fact that the n-terminal unstructured region of a se is not essential for its function in mirna metabolism  <cit> .

both soybean and sorghum genomes encode two arabidopsis hst homologs . although gmhsta and b proteins are 79% similar to athst, they are 96% similar to each other. sbhsta protein is 73% similar to athst, but sbhstb shows only 59% similar to sbhsta and 49% to athst. the low similarities of sbhstb with sbhsta and athst indicate that sbhstb might be evolved into novel functions besides exporting mirnas. further research is deserved to conduct to test this hypothesis.

the dsrna binding protein hyl <dig>  which contains two dsrna-binding domains at its n-terminus, is another essential component of mirna biogenesis  <cit> . soybean genome encodes two hyl <dig> homologs that are 96% similar to each other, whereas sorghum encodes one hyl <dig> homolog . gmhyl1a/b and sbhyl <dig> have more than 70% sequence identity with athyl <dig> at their n-terminal regions , which contains two dsrna-binding domains. however, their c-terminal regions have no or little homology to that of athyl <dig>  this is consistent with the fact that two dsrna domains of hyl <dig> are essential and sufficient for its activity in mirna biogenesis  <cit> .

rdrs
rdr is another important component of gene silencing, and it has a conserved rdrp domain. six rdrs in arabidopsis can be divided into four families: rdr <dig>  rdr <dig>  rdr <dig>  and rdr <dig>  <cit> . rdr <dig> family contains three members , which share more than 80% similarities to each other  <cit> . all proteins in soybean and sorghum were scanned for the rdrp domain with hmm, and the candidates were compared the results from searching all arabidopsis rdr protein sequences against soybean and sorghum genomes with tblastn. soybean and sorghum each encodes seven rdrs, which can be grouped into four families as arabidopsis . in soybean, rdr <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> families each contains two members and rdr <dig> family has a single gene, which is more similar to rdr3b in arabidopsis. in sorghum, rdr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> families each contains one member and the rdr <dig> family possesses four. the phylogenetic tree of these rdr genes is shown in figure  <dig> 



protein lengths were obtained from phytozome annotations.

like other rdrs, these sorghum and soybean rdrs contain a common sequence motif corresponding to the catalytic β’ subunit of dna-dependent rna polymerases  <cit> . the putative catalytic domains of soybean and sorghum rdr <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> proteins all contain the dldgd motif, which is highly conserved in other identified rdrs  <cit> . like rdrs in other plants  <cit> , rdr <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  proteins in soybean and sorghum also have the conserved subsequences, csgs, gsgg, and asgs, before the dldgd motif. protein sequence analysis shows that the second position on the dldgd motif has some variations. like atrdr <dig>  the motif sequences in soybean and sorghum rdr <dig> proteins are dfdgd  <cit> . there are two more conserved motifs in all rdr proteins. all rdr <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> sequences including soybean and sorghum, carry a pclhgdr motif while rdr <dig> has pglhgdih  <cit> . the second motif is adxpkxg; proteins for rdr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes specifically have avdktg motif and rdr <dig> proteins have adapkxg  <cit> . like other plants, rdr <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> proteins in soybean and sorghum also have two additional conserved motifs: qiry and asawy  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the combination of domains in rdrs in soybean, sorghum, and arabidopsis.

soybean and sorghum pol iv and pol v
in order to gain insight into the pol iv and pol v complex, the largest and the second largest subunits of pol iv are searched by searching atnrpd <dig>  atnrpe <dig>  and atnrpd2/nrpe <dig> against soybean and sorghum genomes with tblastn. soybean encodes two nrpd <dig>  two nrpd2/nrpe <dig>  and two nrpe <dig>  and hence they are named as gmnrpd1a/b, gmnrpd2a/nrpe2a, gmnrpd2b/nrpe2b, and gmnrpe1a/b. sorghum encodes one nrpd <dig>  one nrpd2/nrpe <dig>  and one nrpe <dig> for sbnrpd <dig>  sbnrpd2/nrpe <dig>  and sbnrpe <dig>  all genes are listed in table  <dig>  gmnrpd1a is 97% similar to gmnrpd1b and both are around 67% similar to atnrpd <dig>  whereas gmnrpd2a/nrpe2a and gmnrpd2b/nrpe2b are 98% similar to each other and are 80% similar to atnrpd2/nrpe <dig>  gmnrpe1a and gmnrpe1b share 79% similarity and are 61% similar to atnrpe <dig>  sbnrpd <dig>  sbnrpd2/nrpe <dig>  and sbnrpe <dig> show only 51% homolog with their arabidopsis counterparts. phylogenetic analysis shows the close evolutionary relationships of nrpd1/nrpe <dig> to rpb <dig> and nrpd2/nrpe <dig> to rpb <dig> in both soybean and sorghum, which agrees with the proposed mode that nrpd1/nrpe <dig> and nrpd2/nrpe <dig> are alleles to rpb <dig> and rpb <dig>  respectively  <cit> . protein sequence alignment also revealed the presence of conserved catalytic center residues within nrpd1s and nrpe1s in soybean and sorghum.



protein lengths were obtained from phytozome annotations.

ago proteins
ago proteins often contain four domains: n-terminal function-unknown domain , paz, mid, and c-terminal piwi domains. proteins in soybean and sorghum with these four domains are identified by hmm analysis, and tblastn was performed to align arabidopsis ago proteins against sorghum and soybean genomes for comparison. forteen agos in sorghum and  <dig> agos in soybean were identified, respectively . based on phylogenetic analysis, all ago proteins can be grouped into three families: ago <dig>  ago <dig>  and ago <dig>  for sorghum, the ago <dig> family consists of  <dig> members, who are four ago1s, four ago5s, one ago10s and one ago <dig>  which is named with osago <dig> because of their high similarity  <cit> . the ago <dig> family has two proteins, ago <dig> and ago <dig>  and the ago <dig> family contains two ago <dig> proteins. in soybean,  <dig> soybean agos are grouped as ago <dig> family: two clustered to form the ago <dig> subfamily, two for the ago <dig> subfamily, and seven for the ago <dig> subfamily. among four soybean ago proteins in the ago <dig> family, two are clustered with ago2/ <dig> and the others are more closely related to ago <dig>  two genes in ago2/ <dig> subfamily are named as gmago <dig> because they are more similar to atago <dig> than atago <dig>  the soybean ago <dig> family has six members: three ago4s, two ago6s, and one ago <dig>  like dcls, these ago proteins are named based on their similarities with their arabidopsis counterparts . in the current genome annotation, gmago10g and gmago10e were predicted to encode  <dig> and  <dig> aa-long proteins, respectively, which miss c-terminal portions of piwi domains. additional gene annotation procedure was conducted and finds that ago10g and ago10e may encode two longer proteins with  <dig> aa and  <dig> aa, respectively.



protein lengths were obtained from phytozome annotations.

the domain combinations of these ago proteins in arabidopsis, soybean, and sorghum are shown in figure  <dig>  the paz and mid domains bind the 3′-end and 5′-phosphate of rnas, respectively  <cit> . the piwi domain has a similar structure as rnaseh and is responsible for the target mrna cleavage. all the soybean and sorghum ago proteins contains these four domains except for sbago6b, which does not have the n-terminal duf <dig> domain but possesses two tandem piwi domains. the active site of one piwi domain responsible for rna cleavage often carries a conserved metal-chelating asp–asp–his  motif, which are correspond to d <dig>  d <dig>  and h <dig> of atago <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, a conserved histidine at position  <dig> of ago <dig> in arabidopsis has been shown to be essential for ago cleavage activity  <cit> . protein sequence alignment of all new discovered agos reveals that  <dig> soybean agos and  <dig> sorghum agos have the conserved ddh/h <dig> motifs . in five soybean agos  and two sorghum agos , only the h <dig> is replaced by alanine, proline, or serine in the motif . the histidine residue in the ddh motif is missed in gmago5b, gmago10g, and gmago10e, and replaced by aspartic acid in gmago3a, gmago3b and sbago <dig> . gmago6b and ago10g replace the second aspartic acid with alanine or lysine and ago10g misses the third histidine in ddh motif . alterations in the catalytic motif in these agos indicate that they may not cleave targets. it has been shown that some of agos with the ddh motif do not have cleavage activity  <cit> . thus, it needs to be verified whether agos with ddh motifs in sorghum and soybean have the cleavage activity.

*motifs show the residues in soybean and sorghum ago proteins that are correspond to d <dig>  d <dig>  h986/h <dig> of atago <dig>  the symbol “-” means the corresponding residue is missed.

experimental validation
to confirm the expression of these rna silencing components, we collected rna-seq data from sequence read archive , and analyzed these rna-seq data to get the gene expression profiles for these new identified genes. according the numbers of mapped short reads, most identified genes have many mapped reads in different tissues and some of them even have very large numbers of mapped rna-seq reads. figure  <dig> shows the rna-seq signals for some discovered genes, and detailed results of rna-seq data analysis for all genes are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  to further ascertain the rt-results, we searched those discovered rna silencing components against the dbest database  <cit>  and plantgdb  <cit>  for expressed sequence tags . we found the presence of ests of these genes in different tissues of soybean and sorghum.  to further confirm these rna silencing components in sorghum and soybean are indeed expressed, reverse transcription pcr  was conducted. rt-pcr was performed on rnas from inflorescence as templates using oligo dt primers. the resulting cdna then was subjected to pcr using gene specific primers. rt-pcr identified the transcripts of these predicted rna silencing components. please see the additional file 3: figure s <dig> for rt-pcr results for those genes. the results of rt-pcr agree with rna-seq data analysis results.

discussions
dcl is the essential component for mirna and sirna biogenesis  <cit> . although animals encode one dcl for the generation of both mirnas and sirnas, plants evolve four dcl groups  <cit> . these dcls have overlapping and diversified functions in mirna and sirna biogenesis  <cit> . both sorghum and soybean possess four dcl families, which further supports the notion that expansion of dcl family members in monocots and dicots happens after divergence between animal and plants  <cit> . sorghum has two dcl <dig> paralogs, dcl3a and dcl3b, which have low similarity to each other, whereas soybean encodes one dcl <dig>  this result is consistent with the hypothesis that the dcl <dig> paralog in monocots was generated after divergence between monocots and dicots  <cit> . osdcl3a acts in non-canonical long mirna biogenesis and  <dig> ra-sirna biogenesis, whereas osdcl3b functions in phased 24-nt sirna biogenesis, indicating that the function of dcl <dig> paralogs is diversified  <cit> . because of the high similarities of sbdcl3a to osdcl3a and sbdcl3b to osdcl3b, sbdcl3a/b most likely have different functions in the small rna pathway.

in arabidopsis, dcl <dig>  se, tough and hyl <dig> form a complex to process pri-mirna in nucleus to generate mirna duplex that are methylated by hen <dig> and exported into cytoplasm by hst  <cit> . the identification of dcl <dig>  hyl <dig>  se, hen <dig>  and hst homologs in sorghum and soybean suggests that the biogenesis processes of mirnas in them are similar to that of arabidopsis. it is noted that in sorghum, the paralogs of hyl <dig>  se, hen <dig>  and hst are less similar to each other, but each has a closely related homolog in rice. this indicates that the duplication may occur before divergence between rice and sorghum about 50– <dig> million years ago  <cit> . however, one can note that ses in both soybean and sorghum have three paralogs each, which is more than other components in soybean/sorghum and se in arabidopsis do. this indicates the selective duplication for ses in soybean and sorghum, besides whole genome duplication.

rdr is essential for sirna biogenesis as well  <cit> . studies from arabidopsis, rice, and maize have shown that plants possesses four groups of rdrs: rdr <dig>  rdr <dig>  rdr <dig> and rdr <dig>  rdr <dig> from arabidopsis and maize , rdr <dig> from arabidopsis and rice are required for ra-sirna and ta-sirna biogenesis, respectively  <cit> . recently, it was shown that rdr <dig> acts redundantly with rdr <dig> in viral-derived sirna biogenesis  <cit> . the function of rdr <dig> family is currently unknown yet. corresponding rdr <dig>  rdr <dig>  rdr <dig>  and rdr <dig> homologs for both soybean and sorghum are identified, which further supports the notion that the rdr gene family in plants is derived from a common ancestor.

the putative largest subunit and the second largest subunit of pol iv and polv, which are required for ra-sirna-mediated dna methylation, are discovered from soybean and sorghum. this agrees with the notion that pol v and pol iv are plant specific polymerases. in maize, lack of pol iv and pol v causes development defects  <cit> , whereas in arabidopsis, the nrpd and nrpe mutants appear to grow normally. it is interesting to further test whether pol iv and pol v are necessary for the development of soybean and sorghum.

ago is the effector protein for small rna-mediated silencing  <cit> . it is proposed that both plants and animals encode multiple agos to meet the diversified functions of small rna silencing  <cit> . like rice, maize, and arabidopsis, both soybean and sorghum encode three subfamilies of ago proteins, indicating that small rna functions are conserved in higher plants. soybean encodes seven ago <dig> paralogs. among of them, gmago10a/b/c share high similarity to each other, while gmago10d/e/f/g are clustered. the similarity of these two groups of gmago <dig> is relatively low, which indicates that their functions might be different. they might regulate the functions of different mirnas. in arabidopsis, ago <dig> has been shown to regulate the function of mir166/ <dig>  <cit> .

the identification of these putative rna silencing components would give insight on small rna pathways in soybean and sorghum. however, the exact function and contribution of individual component of rna silencing machinery needs to be further examined because their functions may be diverse among different plant species.

CONCLUSIONS
small rna-mediated gene silencing is an important mechanism to regulate gene expression and genome stability in plants. the available sorghum and soybean genome information enable the identification of components that may involve in small-rna mediated gene silencing in soybean and sorghum  <cit> . the gene families, including dcl, hen <dig>  se, hyl <dig>  hst, rdr, nrpd <dig>  nrpd2/nrpe <dig>  nrpe <dig>  and ago, in soybean and sorghum were identified. rna-seq, est and rt-pcr analysis confirmed the expression of these candidate genes. in soybean, the similarities among paralogs are very high, which is consistent with the hypothesis that there have been 1– <dig> rounds of genome duplication in soybean since the separation of homolog sequences between soybean and arabidopsis approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . based on the knowledge of their counterparts in arabidopsis, putative functions to these genes are annotated.
