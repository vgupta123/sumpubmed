BACKGROUND
alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase   is a lysosomal hydrolase that catalyzes the removal of terminal α-n-acteylgalactosamine  and, to a lesser extent, galactose monosaccharide from polysaccharides, glycolipids and glycoproteins  <cit> . the physiological importance of this enzyme is evidenced by the catabolic disorders due to deficiency of α-galnacase. in human, mutation in α-galnacase gene leads to a loss of enzymatic activity in the lysosome and subsequent accumulation of undegraded glycoconjugates in tissues  <cit> , which eventually results in schindler diseases and kanzaki disease . α-galnacase enzyme is most closely related to the α-galactosidase a  enzyme, and mutation in α-galactosidase a gene lead to fabry disease  <cit> .

because of similar substrate specificity and physical properties including subunit molecular mass and homodimeric structure, α-galnacase was initially referred to as α-galactosidase b. however, subsequent studies of kinetics, immunoreactivity, peptide and gene mapping demonstrated that α-galnacase and α-galactosidase are two distinct enzymes derived from two different genes  <cit> . upon crystallographic analysis, they were found to have high similarity in active sites as  <dig> of the  <dig> active site residues are conserved, differing only in their recognition sequences. base upon similarities in sequences, active sites, and mechanisms, both human α-galnacase and α-galactosidase are classified into family  <dig> of glycoside hydrolase family   <cit> .

α-galnacase has been purified from various animal tissues including human, bovine, pig, chicken, earthworm, snail and gastropod . thus far, all the α-galnacases from animal tissues exhibited α-galactosidase activity. α-galnacase without α-galactosidase activity has been found only in microbes. much efforts were directed for isolation of microbial α-galnacases that can efficiently cleave the immunodominant α-galnac residue from blood group a antigen at physiological ph. prokaryotic α-galnacases are grouped into family gh  <dig> and gh  <dig> .

marine animals are well known as potential sources of novel enzymes and provide useful information in understanding the structure and function of mammalian enzymes. we previously reported the occurrence of an unusual form, α-galnacase ii, which was free from α-galactosidase activity, in addition to a typical form, α-galnacase i in squid , a marine invertebrate  <cit> . to confirm the presence of novel form is common in marine invertebrate, we further explored α-galnacases in starfish  and purified two different α-galnacases, α-galnacase i and ii. the two enzymes appeared to be different with respect to enzymatic characteristics such as molecular mass, optimum ph, pi, ph stability, enzyme kinetics , and substrate specificities. α-galnacase ii was monomer and heat stable, while α-galnacase i was multimer and heat labile. both α-galnacase i and ii removed terminal α-galnac of natural compounds investigated: forsman hapten glycolipid, blood group a type trisaccharide, galnac-α1-o-serine. contrary, oligosaccharide and glycolipid containing α-galactosyl terminal were hydrolyzed by α-galnacase i only, but not by α-galnacase ii  <cit> . the k
m and vmax values of α-galnacase ii for pnp-α-galnac  were much higher than that of α-galnacase i . α-galnacase ii activity was significantly inhibited by ag+ and hg+ <dig> salts, while α-galnacase i activity was not much affected. however, the interrelationship between α-galnacase i and α-galnacase ii and the molecular basis of their enzymological differences remain to be known.

in this study, we made chemical and structural comparisons between α-galnacase i and ii from starfish using deglycosylation, immunostaining, n-terminal sequencing, peptide analysis and chemical modifications. in addition, we proposed the relationship between the substrate specificities and protein structures of the two enzymes.

RESULTS
homogeneity and deglycosylation of α-galnacase i and ii
two enzymes, α-galnacase i and ii were purified from digestive organ of starfish and their enzymatic properties were characterized  <cit> . both α-galnacase i and ii appeared to be homogeneous and gave single protein band on sds-page at 47 kda and 43 kda subunit mass, respectively. the respective subunit mass of α-galnacase i and ii was reduced by about 4 kda upon treatment with pngase f, indicating that both enzymes released the same extent of n-linked glycan . the deglycosylated protein showed sharp and narrow, while the glycosylated protein showed broad band.fig.  <dig> deglycosylation and immunostaining of α-galnacase i and ii. a sds-page of purified and deglycosylated α-galnacase i and ii. the proteins were separated on sds-page and the gel was stained with cbb r- <dig> solution. s, molecular weight marker; −, purified enzyme; +, enzyme treated with pngase f. b immunostaining between α-galnacase and anti-α-galnacase antibodies.  <dig>  antiserum to human α-galnacase;  <dig>  antiserum to squid α-galnacase i; and  <dig>  antiserum to squid α-galnacase ii. lane i, enzyme α-galnacase i; and lane ii, enzyme α-galnacase ii




immunological property
to study structural homologies of α-galnacase i and ii, immunological techniques were applied using anti-human α-galnacase polyclonal anti-body produced in rabbit  <cit> . interestingly, anti-human α-galnacase reacted intensely with α-galnacase i and showed no detectable cross reaction with α-galnacase ii , suggesting that α-galnacase i and ii might have different antigenicity. moreover, we used anti-squid α-galnacase produced in rabbit  <cit>  in immunostaining to differentiate immunological properties of α-galnacase i and ii. anti-α-galnacase i reacted intensely with α-galnacase i and barely with α-galnacase ii , whereas, anti-α-galnacase ii reacted equally with both α-galnacase i and ii .

structural homology
the comparison between α-galnacase i and ii were carried out by n-terminal sequencing of the first twenty amino acids. the deduced n-terminal sequences of α-galnacase i and ii were compared with the corresponding sequences from human  <cit> , chicken  <cit>  and squid α-galnacases  <cit> , and human α-galactosidase  <cit> . sequence similarity analysis revealed 75% homology between galnacase i and α-galnacase ii. both enzymes were highly homologous  to human α-galactosidase, human and chicken α-galnacases and to more closely related α-galnacases from squid .table  <dig> n-terminal amino acid sequences of α-galnacase from starfish and other sources

the primary structures of α-galnacase i and ii were also compared by peptide mapping. α-galnacase i and ii were digested with lysylendopeptidase to have near completion for 24 h and resulting digestive products were separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography  . comparison of peptide maps of α-galnacase i and ii revealed both similarities and differences in their peptide peaks. most of the individually collected peptides were subjected to ms/ms analysis for sequencing and some of them are shown in fig.  <dig>  we could not confirm the amino acid sequence of each of the peptides due to either low yield or contamination with the other peptides. the peptide sequences of α-galnacase i and ii, when aligned with the counterpart from chicken α-galnacase amino acid sequences, showed high homology as determined by blast homology search . the active site residues  were conserved in both α-galnacase i and ii. however, some substitutions of amino acid residues g <dig>  m <dig>  t <dig>  e <dig>  k <dig>  f <dig>  q <dig>  g <dig>  a <dig>  f <dig> were identified in α-galnacase ii in place of the corresponding residues a <dig>  l <dig>  a <dig>  m <dig>  d <dig>  l <dig>  t <dig>  c <dig>  w <dig>  and w <dig> in chicken α-galnacase . interestingly, two amino acid substitutions, g <dig> and a <dig> were found in α-galnacase ii near the catalytic site that were conserved in α-galnacase i and other typical α-galnacases, suggesting that these residues might play important roles in determining the substrate specificity. from molecular modeling of the enzymes , it appears that two disulphide bridge c111-c <dig> and c171-c <dig> exist in galnacase i near the catalytic site, whereas, one disulphide bridge  is absent in α-galnacase ii due to substitution of c <dig> with g <dig> fig.  <dig> peptide maps of α-galnacase i and ii. rp-hplc separation of lysylendopeptidase digested peptides of α-galnacase i a and α-galnacase-ii b. blank sample  contain the peaks b. the peptide peaks indicated with asterisk are subjected for amino acid sequence by ms/ms analysis. see text for details

inhibition of enzyme activity
chemical modification studies were carried out to confirm the active site residues involved in the catalytic reaction of α-galnacase. the involvement of serine, aspartate and tryptophan in the catalytic activity was evident by modification of these residues, which resulted in significant loss of enzyme activity of α-galnacase i and ii, by dfp, cnm-hcl and nbs, respectively . modification of carboxyl group of glutamate by cnm-hcl is not responsible for inactivation of enzyme, because glutamate residue is not present in the catalytic site of α-galnacase  <cit> . nbs specifically modified tryptophan rather tyrosine at low ph  <cit> . like α-galnacase activity, the α-galactosidase activity of enzyme i was similarly inactivated by dfp and cnm-hcl. however, the retention of α-galactosidase activity was higher than that of α-galnacase activity in nbs mediated inactivation. to find out the reason for high retention of α-galactosidase activity of α-galnacase i, we determined the number of tryptophan residues involved in activity. nbs mediated inactivation of enzyme was accompanied by decrease in absorbance of modified protein at 280 nm. using the molar absorption coefficient of tryptophan at 280 nm of 5500 m− <dig> cm− <dig>  a graph of percent residual activity versus the number of tryptophan residues modified was plotted for α-galnacase and α-galactosidase activities of enzyme i . extrapolation of graph to 0% activity confirms that α-galnacase activity depends on a single tryptophan residue and α-galactosidase activity depends on two tryptophan residues. these results indicate that tryptophan residue has a critical role in enzyme activity. in the inhibition studies with various monosaccharides, α-galnacase activity was found to be strongly inhibited by galnac and slightly by galactose, and similarly, the α-galactosidase activity of α-galnacase i was inhibited by those inhibitors as well .table  <dig> effect of various selective amino acid modifying agents on α-galnacase and α-galactosidase activities of starfish α-galnacase i and ii

discussion
in a previous study we successfully distinguished α-galnacase i and ii from starfish with respect to their enzymatic properties  <cit> . like typical form of α-galnacases isolated from various animal tissues, α-galnacase i contained intrinsic α-galactosidase activity . contrary, α-galnacase ii was free from α-galactosidase activity and rare in animal tissues. α-galnacase without α-galactosidase activity was available in microbes . the subunit mass of α-galnacase i and ii appeared to differ on sds-page in native form and after deglycosylation with pngase f . the differences in subunit mass and enzyme kinetics of α-galnacase ii with α-galnacase i highlighted the possibility that this is an exceptional form in animal sources.

immunological study with antibody raised against human α-galnacase clearly distinguished the two forms. isoform i intensely reacted with the antibody, whereas isoform ii had no detectable reactivity . as expected, the same results were obtained when tested with anti-squid α-galnacase i . in contrast, anti-squid α-galnacase ii reacted equally with α-galnacase i and ii . these results suggest the presence of both common and different antigenic determinants on both α-galnacase i and ii and indicate their similarities and differences in structure. the structural interrelationship between α-galnacase i and ii was clearly understood from their n-terminal sequencing and peptide mapping . the high level of sequence similarities of the n-terminal amino acids and the internal peptides of α-galnacase i and ii with chicken and human α-galnacase allowed us to locate the structural conservation site including the active site and the substrate recognition loop . collectively, the results suggest that α-galnacase i and ii are closely related with regard to their primary and higher order structure and belong to ghf  <dig> glycosidase  <cit> .

α-galnacase is a retaining glycosidase, where both substrate and product have anomeric carbons with α configurations. the catalytic mechanism of α-retaining ghf  <dig> members is based on a double displacement catalytic reaction by two conserved aspartate residues  <cit> . the mechanism involves first the nucleophilic attack of d <dig>  and d <dig> serves as a subsequent proton donor and acceptor by the carboxyl group on the α <dig> position of ligand . the active site residues w <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  y <dig>  c <dig>  k <dig>  d <dig>  c <dig>  s <dig>  a <dig>  y <dig>  r <dig> and d <dig> are conserved in α-galnacase homologues series  <cit> . among the  <dig> residues,  <dig> are common in human α-galactosidase, and the other two define the substrate specificities between α-galnacase and α-galactosidase  <cit> . the residues s <dig> and a <dig> of the substrate recognizing loop , also called n-acetyl recognition loop, in α-galnacase are replaced with glutamate and leucine, respectively in human α-galactosidase a, to accommodate smaller hydroxyl group of α-galactosyl ligand but not the larger n-acetyl group  <cit> . in α-galnacase ii, we have identified substitution of two conserved residues, g <dig> and a <dig> in place of the corresponding residues, c <dig> and w <dig> in typical α-galnacases . since the residues are located in the substrate recognizing loop, it is highly possible that they might influence the recognition of the substrate. from molecular modeling, it was observed that the disulfide bridge , which is formed in typical α-galnacases and involved in hydrophobic interaction with c- <dig> of α-galactosyl ligand, is disrupted in α-galnacase ii due to replacement with g <dig> . the large and bulky w <dig> is replaced with a small residue alanine within the loop  in α-galnacase ii and thus generate a larger space for the pocket for accommodation of the n-acetyl group as compared to typical α-galnacases. similarly, the small hydroxyl group of galactose moiety loosely fits in the loop cavity and hence showed no or too little α-galactosidase activity in absence of a bulkier indole ring of tryptophan . this is supported by n-acetyl recognition loop composition  of acremonium species α-galnacase which hardly showed α-galactosidase activity  <cit> .fig.  <dig> double displacement catalytic mechanisms of starfish α-galnacase i and ii. step 1: d <dig> from α-galnacase makes a nucleophilic attack on c <dig> of terminal α-galnac of substrate, cleaving the glycosidic linkage and producing a covalent intermediate complex. step 2: a water molecule, deprotonated by d <dig>  makes a nucleophilic attack on c <dig> of α-galnac and cleave the covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate complex and release n-acetylgalactosamine

chemical modification studies supported the presence of serine, aspartate and tryptophan residues in the active site of α-galnacase . a single tryptophan residue  was found to be involved in α-galnacase activity, while two tryptophan residues  was involved in α-galactosidase activity of α-galnacase i . inhibition of α-galnacase and α-galactosidase with galnac supports the existence of dual activities of α-galnacase i , because galnac is the specific inhibitor of α-galnacase enzyme  <cit> . the second tryptophan  is replaced with alanine in α-galnacase ii and showed to be free from α-galactosidase activity.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the experimental results obtained and discussed in this study clearly suggest that α-galnacase i and ii are closely related with respect to their primary and higher order structure. structural comparisons of galnacase i with galnacase ii provided understanding of their differences in substrate specificities in these enzymes. further studies are necessary to find out and isolate genes, which encode two catalytically different α-galnacases evolved from a common ancestor.
