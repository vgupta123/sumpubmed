BACKGROUND
grapevine  is one of the main fruit crops of the mediterranean climate regions in the world . it is also one of the oldest agricultural crops, starting its cultivation during the neolithic  in the transcaucasian region
 <cit>  from its wild progenitor v. vinifera l. subsp. sylvestris . it exhibits a high genetic diversity and heterozygosity level, as in most woody species. genotypes of this species have been traditionally classified in two main groups: winemaking and table grape varieties. these last are mainly for fresh consumption but also some are intended for raisins production. most of these cultivars are the result of centuries of selection and vegetative reproduction, representing a diverse knowledge, preferences and cultivation systems in different regions around the world
 <cit> . indeed, the evaluation of the genetic diversity of collections of representative genotypes using ssr markers have revealed differences in the allelic composition between table grape and wine varieties, indicating that there is a substantial intra-specific differentiation
 <cit> . it is quite likely that table and wine grapes became what they are today through a divergent selection based on human preferences. on this regard, several traits such as thick pericarp, small berries with a larger number of seeds and high tannins and phenolic content have been selected for wine varieties, whereas thinner pericarps, seedlessness and larger rachis aiming to maximize the berry size, are the traits that have been selected for table grapes. there is increasing evidence that genetic diversity relies mainly in genomic structural variants such as snps, short sequence insertions and deletions , inter- and intra-chromosomal translocations and inversions . therefore, it is likely that differences observed between table and wine varieties are due to structural variants. recently, a v. vinifera reference genome was assembled based on the sequencing of a nearly homozygous genotype 
 <cit> . in addition, the genome sequence of the wine cultivar ‘pinot noir’, a highly heterozygous genotype, was released
 <cit> . furthermore, several genome sequencing initiatives in grapevine are in progress, most of them focused on the identification of polymorphisms related to traits of interest for wine production
 <cit> . however, as up to now no genomic sequence from a typical table grape variety has been released, it is not yet possible to establish at a genomic level how different are the two main groups of grapevine genotypes. this is a key aspect not only to increase the knowledge of the genome of the species but also for helping the breeding programs. genetic variations and their associated genetic diversity are critical issues for obtaining new grape varieties. this is a labor-intensive task, where the use of marker-assisted selection  should expedite the selection process. the identification of markers to be used for mas can be greatly improved when the structural variants present in the genome of the parents are known. even though there is a reference genome from a wine variety, the genetic diversity observed in this species does not allow taking full advantage of this genomic tool.

‘sultanina’ is one of the most important table grape varieties playing a pivotal role in modern breeding, mainly because of providing the seedlessness  phenotype.

genetic evidence indicates that vitis vinifera is a highly heterozygous species, and the assembly of a heterozygous genome represents a bioinformatics challenge . in this work we sequenced and implemented a strategy for the de novo assembly of the highly heterozygous genome of ‘sultanina’. our results show that there are a number of structural variants with respect to the grapevine reference genome, including genome fragment translocations, indels and transposable elements relocalization. moreover, a significant number of snps were detected and novel genes not present in the reference genome were also identified. experimental validation of structural variants and snps predicted showed a high rate of success. this new assembled genome will allow us to get a better understanding of the genetics of the table grape group of cultivars, boosting its breeding based on a deeper understanding of the genomes used in the crossing blocks. we propose this assembly and its structural variants catalog as a genomics tool for this key fruit crop.

RESULTS
de novo assembly of ‘sultanina’
we sequenced the diploid genome of ‘sultanina’, a pivotal table grape genotype. the main challenge of the de novo assembly relied on its high heterozygosity . the 25-mer analysis confirmed the highly heterozygous nature of this genome . to address this issue we used a novel approach called haploidify implemented in the allpaths-lg
 <cit>  assembler. this is a decision process, based on statistics of the assembly, which chooses only one haplotype during the assembly. general features of the assembly are summarized in table 
 <dig>  we got a genome size of  <dig> mb which is in agreement with the estimated size of the grapevine genomes . the analysis of contig coverage  showed that longest contigs are enriched in homozygosity
 <cit> . indeed, 79%  of the total contig length was classified as homozygous and the remaining 21%  as heterozygous . in addition, using 95% of identity we were able to recover 82%  of the genes present in the reference genome pn <dig> and the anchoring of our scaffolds to the  <dig> chromosomes in this reference are well distributed, indicating again that our assembly is highly homozygous. using 90% of identity, the recovery rate races to 86%. thus, this de novo assembled genome offers a draft for the search of unique genomic features present in ‘sultanina’. interestingly, it allow us to seek for differences at the nucleotide resolution between table and wine grapes.

the n <dig> of contigs and scaffolds was calculated by ordering all sequences, then adding the lengths from longest to shortest until the added length exceeded 50% of the total length of all sequences. the mrna recovery was defined as the number of mrna of the reference genome contained in a single scaffold with at least 70% of coverage and 95% of identity. the average identity was  <dig> % with a standard deviation of  <dig> %.

novel genes found in ‘sultanina’
from the whole genome comparison with the reference genome pn <dig> we identified  <dig> novel genes in ‘sultanina’ genome  that have est support on the public ncbi est database of vitis sp. from them,  <dig> corresponded to transposon related genes and  <dig> to hypothetical genes. from the remaining  <dig> genes the most represented biological function was associated to disease resistance/defense response . other classes of novel genes that are represented in ‘sultanina’ genome are related to proteolysis, embryo development, carbon-nitrogen bonds, methyltransferase and anthocyanin synthesis.

structural variants  and snps catalog
we used both de novo assembly and reads mapping methods for the detection of structural variants  in the range of  <dig> bp to  <dig> kb between ‘sultanina’ and the reference genome pn <dig>  we considered as svs to indels, inversions and inter-intra chromosomal rearrangements; and snps were considered independently. we identified  <dig>  insertions from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  deletions from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  complex svs, defined as inversions or inter-intra chromosomal rearrangements from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp. also,  <dig> , <dig> high quality snps were identified. transposable elements are by far the most common genetic elements causing genomic variations in plants
 <cit> . in our study, we found that gypsy-like and copia retrotransposon elements are the most commonly found polymorphisms , confirming previous findings in grapevine using a reduced part of the genome
 <cit> . we examined the whole genome distribution of svs and snps. we identified homozygous and heterozygous snps and indels  which are distributed throughout the chromosomes . we found that around 70% of indels and snps are located in intergenic and intronic regions . short svs  are the most abundant . the higher frequency for those found in cdss corresponds to svs with lengths that are multiple of three nucleotides  which is consistent with what has been described in other organisms
 <cit> . a significant number of genes exhibit homozygous indels, suggesting that the function of proteins encoded by these genes may be altered . the whole genome distribution of polymorphisms revealed the existence of islands of homozygosity and heterozygosity. to further explore this phenomenon, the reference genome was divided into  <dig>  disjoint intervals of length  <dig> kb and we counted the amount of heterozygous and homozygous variants on each interval . we found  <dig> loci where both alleles were the same but diverged from the reference genome  and  <dig> loci where only one allele diverged . the other loci could not be discriminated . interestingly, among the loci that diverged between both genomes we found genes related to embryo development and it has been proposed that genomic regions with significantly high homozygosity have been related to domestication processes
 <cit> . about  <dig>  genes showed a positive selection . among them,  <dig> genes had more than  <dig> snps . this suggests that around 2% of the genes present in the ‘sultanina’ genome are undergoing a rapid divergence in protein coding regions. from these  <dig> genes,  <dig> presented a go term associated. a go enrichment analysis under biological process gave  <dig> categories that were statistically significantly overrepresented . interestingly, genes related to response to stimulus, as well as anatomical and reproductive structure developments were within this group .

classified repetitive elements were annotated within structural variants and the five most abundant are shown. these repetitive elements account for around 90% or more of the total elements. among the heterozygous and homozygous groups the retrotransposable elements are the more abundant ones. the percentage was estimated as described in additional file
13: figure s <dig> and methods.

variant types produced by deletions or insertions were classified according to their effect in the coding region. the total number of genes affected by indels is shown in the third column. as it can be seen, some genes contain more than one event.

experimental confirmation of snps and indels predicted in ‘sultanina’
twenty seven indels predicted in the ‘sultanina’ genome were selected for validation. primer pairs amplifying fragments among  <dig> to  <dig> bp were selected and the amplicons were analyzed using capillary electrophoresis-laser-induced fluorescence  assay . twenty four indels,  <dig> deletions and  <dig> insertions, were confirmed . an example of these is shown in figure 
 <dig>  interestingly,  <dig> out of the  <dig> confirmed indels fit the predicted homo- or heterozygous haplotype in ‘sultanina’. a group of  <dig> heterozygous and homozygous snps predicted in the ‘sultanina’ genome were selected to be confirmed by sequencing and qpcr-hrm . the group included  <dig> transitions and  <dig> transversions, with snp-calling quality values distributed in the interval from  <dig>  to  <dig>  twenty one of them  were confirmed . furthermore, robust and confident melting and hrm curves were optimized for six of such snps, and a group of  <dig> table grape varieties  were used to confirm the transferability of them. the average polymorphism information content value  for these six snps was  <dig> , ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , suggesting their feasibility and transferability. as an example, the result for tssnp <dig> is shown in figure 
 <dig>  three genotypic classes for this snp were observed.

seedlessness trait
seedlessness is a desirable trait in table grapes. a qtl for seedlessness has been mapped to chromosome  <dig>  and a polymorphic form of vvagl <dig>  has been found to explain a high percentage of seedlessness variance in ‘sultanina’
 <cit> . our svs analysis confirmed a  <dig> bp heterozygous insertion in the 5’utr of vvagl <dig>  gene in ‘sultanina’ genome . this insertion is not present in this locus in the reference genome, which derives from a genotype that produces seeded fruits. in order to look for additional genes that may contribute to seedlessness in ‘sultanina’, we searched for orthologous genes whose mutations in arabidopsis lead to an embryo defective phenotype
 <cit> . four hundred ninety six putative orthologous genes were identified in the ‘sultanina’ genome. forty two of these genes contained either indels in promoter and coding regions or no synonymous and frame shift snps in the coding region. thirty of these genes were located in homozygous regions; therefore, we put more attention to these genes since they can be more tightly linked to seedlessness . thirteen of these genes were also located in previously mapped qtls for seedlessness in a progeny derived from the cross between ‘ruby seedless’ and ‘sultanina’
 <cit> . therefore, it is likely that these genes affected by svs or snps may be considered as main positional candidate genes responsible for seed development. every sv or snp present in each one of the  <dig> genes was confirmed by comparing the different reads used in the assembly of the respective contig.

discussion
‘sultanina’ is an ancient seedless cultivar of unprecise geographical origin in old persia. after it was brought to france and then popularized in america under the name ‘thompson seedless’, this cultivar has become key in the modern table grape breeding, being present in the pedigree of numerous modern varieties. it is also the main source of seedlessness used in breeding programs , a prime trait for fresh consumption. also, a number of somatic mutations exhibiting variations in berry size and seeds number have been described as derived from this genotype. however, no further studies have been done related to its phenotypic characteristics and its genetic constitution. today, there is an increasing effort to establish the relationship between phenotypes and the genomic information of a species. in the case of the grapevine, the availability of a reference genome based on a wine-derived genotype  has not been as effective for table grape genetic studies as it would have been expected. this is probably due to the genetic divergence between wine and table grapes
 <cit> , phenotypically represented by traits such as the presence of seeds and their relationship with berry size
 <cit> , or the different content in phenolic compounds such as flavanols, flavonols and hydroxy-benzoic acids
 <cit> . in this work, we obtained the first draft of the highly heterozygous ‘sultanina’ genome based entirely on ngs technologies and de novo assembly. the assembly of highly heterozygous genomes exhibits unique and difficult challenges. moreover, there are few algorithmic ideas able to handle this kind of complexity . in plants, the most frequent strategy to build reference genomes has been based on the selection of highly homozygous individuals, what in most woody species is a very long process and seldomly addressed, not available for table grapes. here we used allpaths-lg assembler to tackle the heterozygotic nature of ‘sultanina’. our strategy led to a draft genome sharing similar metrics  with the previously assembled genome of the heterozygous ‘pinot noir’
 <cit> , which was obtained through sanger and  <dig> sequencing technologies. after a whole genome comparison between the ‘sultanina’ genome and the grapevine reference genome pn <dig>  we succeeded to provide the first comprehensive catalog of svs and snps between both genotypes, at the nucleotide level. this catalog contains about  <dig> , <dig> variants including snps, indels, translocations and inversions. the snp rate is in agreement with previous reports on this species
 <cit> . the classification of variants into homozygous and heterozygous revealed enriched islands of each kind distributed throughout the chromosomes. the experimental confirmation proved that about 90% of our svs and snps predictions were true, showing the precision of the catalog. indeed, our experimental validation of svs can be considered as the first evidence suggesting the feasibility and transferability of snp reported in ‘sultanina’ catalog as useful tools for genetic studies in table grapes. we also found a set of rapidly evolving genes  and  <dig> novel genes. interestingly, go terms related to pathogen resistance and quality traits were over-represented in rapidly evolving genes. this is likely due to a combination of natural selection by pressure of pathogens and artificial pressure due to the domestication process with selection of agronomically important traits . a similar phenomenon has been observed in species such as rice, sorghum and maize when genomes of different varieties or landraces are compared .

svs and snps are a source of genetic variability; since, they are important in generating new genes or allelic variants that may be selected by natural or artificial means, if they confer an advantage to the fruit crop. the search for genes responsible for traits of interest has been tackled by seeking qtls. however, the reduced size of the mapping populations commonly used in woody fruit crops renders too wide confidence intervals, corresponding to genomic regions of various cm harboring tens to hundreds of candidate genes per qtl
 <cit> . the availability of the ‘sultanina’ genome would help to improve the saturation of the genomic region where a qtl has been identified, in a simpler and better way than it has been done until now based on the reference genome. this should reduce substantially the list of candidate genes to focus in subsequent analyses. in addition, the availability of a catalog of structural variants and snps can help in the identification of candidates genes related to traits of interest. in this work, we confirmed the indel previously described in the regulatory region of the vvagl <dig> gene. this gene has been proposed as the main responsible for seedlessness
 <cit> , and this indel has been converted into an effective selection marker for seedlessness
 <cit> . interestingly, the sequencing of ‘sultanina’ highlighted other svs and snps affecting the structure of genes related to embryo development, some of them located in other qtls that explain the residual seedlessness phenotypic variance
 <cit> .

this ‘sultanina’ draft genome should improve the efficiency of molecular assisted breeding in table grape and the search for genes associated to different traits could be better approached. in addition, the proposed svs and snps catalog will become a powerful tool to improve and expedite processes such as synteny-based comparisons, mutations detection, transgenes localization, among other genetic studies and breeding-related applications in table grapes.

CONCLUSIONS
we produced a draft of the ‘sultanina’ genome of size  <dig> mb. eighty-two percent of the genes present in the reference genome were recovered and  <dig> novel genes were identified. a large number of svs and snps were found. forty-five  were experimentally confirmed in ‘sultanina’ and among them six snps in other  <dig> table grape varieties. two thousand genes were affected by these variants. the ‘sultanina’ genome should improve the efficiency of molecular assisted breeding in table grape and the search for genes associated to different traits could be better approached. in addition, the proposed svs and snps catalog will become a powerful tool to improve and expedite processes such as synteny-based comparisons, mutations detection, transgenes localization, among other genetic studies and breeding-related applications in table grapes.
