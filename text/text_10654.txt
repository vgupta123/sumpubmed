BACKGROUND
understanding the physiological and molecular mechanism of abiotic stress tolerance in plants is the foundation for developing stress tolerant plants. transcriptome analyses have been successfully used to identify genes associated with abiotic stress responses. a large number of genes altered during various abiotic stresses have been identified through expression profiling, expressed sequence tags , and cdna library generated from various plant species  <cit> . however, identifying the functional significance of individual differentially expressed genes during abiotic stresses is a daunting task. it is important to study the function of these stress-responsive genes not only to understand the mechanism of tolerance, but also for selecting candidate genes for improving the tolerance of susceptible species by genetic engineering.

various functional genomics tools for gene overexpression or down-regulation have been developed for dissecting gene function  <cit> . most commonly used gene knockout or knockdown approaches include ethyl methanesulfonate-induced point mutation  <cit> , t-dna insertion mutation  <cit> , mutation by transposable element insertion  <cit> , targeting induced local lesions in genomes  <cit>  and gene silencing by rnai  <cit> . though these approaches have been widely and successfully used in functional analyses of genes, they have several disadvantages. for example, these approaches require generation of large-scale mutant populations or transgenic plants to screen for mutation in a gene of interest, which is a tedious and time consuming process. mutation or insertion in a gene may not generate obvious phenotypes due to presence of gene families and gene duplications in plant genomes  <cit> . virus-induced gene silencing  is another functional genomics tool that avoids many of these limitations. in addition, vigs can silence either an individual gene or multiple genes in a single plant and can also be used in a high-throughput manner to silence genes in multiple plants  <cit> .

the basic principle of vigs involves delivering viral rna or dna containing a partial sequence of a specific gene into plants  <cit> . exogenous sequences are inserted into specific locations in the virus genome without destroying its infectivity  <cit> . the recombinant virus multiplies and spreads from the site of infection into new developing regions and triggers post-transcriptional gene silencing . vigs has been used as both a forward and reverse genetics tool to study gene function in plants  <cit> . currently about  <dig> different vigs vectors are available for gene silencing  <cit> , of which the tobacco rattle virus -based vigs vector is the most widely used silencing vector  <cit> .

vigs has been used as a tool for dissecting mechanisms of abiotic stress tolerance. genes involved in tolerance to stresses, namely drought  <cit> , uv  <cit> , salinity  <cit> , hypoxia  <cit>  and oxidative stress  <cit> , have been effectively silenced by vigs, and their relevance under respective stresses was studied by various research groups. however, vigs has not been used to identify genes that play various roles in abiotic stress tolerance through a high-throughput forward genetics screening. similarly, despite its potential, vigs has not been used to study the role of a particular gene under multiple stresses at the same time. this is mainly due to lack of a suitable protocol to coincide respective abiotic stresses with vigs-mediated transient gene silencing as well as the absence of robust and easy methods to study the stress effect in silenced plants. most of the methods currently used involve exposure of the whole plant to abiotic stress  <cit> , which is a tedious process for large-scale screening. this scenario necessitates the requirement of high-throughput methodology to study stress effects on plants. in this manuscript, we describe a vigs-based high-throughput methodology to study abiotic stress tolerance. using this methodology, apart from confirming the role of several genes in biotic or abiotic stress tolerance which has been previously reported, we identified few genes that play a role in multi-stress tolerance.

RESULTS
vigs can continue to occur in excised leaf disks for more than six weeks
to determine whether the progression of vigs can continue in excised leaf disks as it does in the whole plant, the leaf disks were collected from trv::nbpds-, trv::nbchlh-, and vector control plants at 8 days post-inoculation  and incubated on ms medium. similar treatment was also done for leaf disks from the non-inoculated wild-type plants. the progression of gene silencing was monitored until  <dig> dpi. agrobacterium-mediated virus construct delivery into plant cell and initiation of vigs is expected to take at least a week’s time. we, therefore, expected to see a silencing phenotype two weeks after trv inoculation. silencing of nbpds and nbchlh genes in plants produces photobleaching and yellowing of leaves, respectively  <cit> . at  <dig> dpi, all the leaf disks were green, and the expected silencing phenotype started from  <dig> dpi and continued for few weeks .

vigs of both nbpds and nbchlh genes occurred in leaf disks incubated both on ms medium and callus induction medium . in addition, uniform silencing persisted even up to  <dig> dpi. as expected, the silencing did not occur in vector control and non-inoculated wild-type plants . rt-pcr analysis of leaf disks maintained on cim showed reduced transcript levels of silenced marker genes. all through the observed period, trv was present in the leaf disks as indicated by pcr amplification of gene encoding coat protein  . the presence of vigs vector is essential for gene silencing by rna viruses  <cit> . conclusively, our results showed that gene silencing can occur in the excised leaf disks. these results are consistent with previous studies that used detached leaves from vigs plants to study agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation  <cit>  and stress assays  <cit> .

silencing genes involved in abiotic stress tolerance in excised leaf disks and their responses to various stresses
one of the objectives of this study was to develop a high-throughput protocol for identification and functional characterization of genes involved in imparting stress tolerance. we selected  <dig> nicotiana benthamiana or tobacco homologous genes that were shown to be differentially expressed during various stress responses in different plant species . genevestigator  <cit>  data showed corresponding arabidopsis homologs of these genes were also induced under respective stresses in arabidopsis . fragments  of these genes were individually cloned into ptrv <dig> vigs vector  <cit> , and the viral constructs were used to silence individual corresponding genes in n. benthamiana as described previously  <cit> . leaf disks were punched from the upper newly developed leaves at  <dig> dpi and the excised tissues were exposed to different abiotic stresses by incubating them on ms medium or cim supplemented with respective stress-inducing agents. responses of the gene-silenced leaf disks to individual abiotic stresses are given below.

*citations are given to indicate the gene function and not silencing of respective gene by vigs.

dehydration and osmotic stress
dehydration stress response was studied by estimating the rate of water loss during dehydration treatment. detached leaf drying assay was reported to be an easy assay for testing large numbers of plants for their dehydration stress avoidance  <cit> . by utilizing this assay, we studied the responses of gene-silenced plants to dehydration stress by evaluating the decline in fresh weight of detached leaves. among  <dig> different gene-silenced plants, leaves from nbgst-, nbrbx1- and nbmyb1-silenced plants showed a 10-20% increase in water loss over vector control plants at 6 h . our results agree with previous reports that gst, rbx <dig> and myb <dig> genes are involved in water deficit stress tolerance  <cit>  and indicate that our method can be used to identify genes involved in dehydration stress avoidance. interestingly, leaves harvested from nteds1-silenced plants showed about 40% increase in water loss over the control at 6 h after detachment from plants . this data indicate that the eds <dig> gene, whose function was implicated mainly in disease resistance  <cit> , may also function in dehydration avoidance.

osmotic stress response was studied by imposing constant low water potential under non-transpiring conditions using polyethylene glycol . callus growth on the peg-stressed leaf disks was measured. leaf disks from nbp5cs1-, nbadr1-, ntmek1- and nbetr1-silenced plants showed about 10-20% more reduction in callus growth compared to control plants . this finding supports previous reports that p5cs <dig>  adr <dig>  mek <dig> and etr <dig> genes play a role in osmotic stress tolerance  <cit> . interestingly, leaf disks from the nbsos1-, nbwrky1- and nbwrky2-silenced plants showed significant tolerance to peg stress . although sos <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> genes were previously implicated in imparting abiotic or biotic stress tolerance  <cit> , it is possible that these genes are not playing positive roles under osmotic stress. vigs has been previously shown to be a potential method for studying the relevance of only a few genes under water deficit stress  <cit>  because the stress imposition methods used were cumbersome and not feasible for large-scale experiments. however, the results described here show that this lacuna can now be overcome. taken together, our data suggest that leaf/leaf disks undergoing vigs can be used to identify and characterize gene functions in dehydration and osmotic stress tolerance in a high-throughput manner.

salinity stress
in order to develop a high-throughput protocol for assessing gene function in salinity tolerance, we incubated gene-silenced leaf disks on cim with nacl followed by callus growth assessment. leaf disks from nbsos1-silenced plants showed the highest reduction  in growth, both under  <dig> and 200 mm nacl stress, compared to non-stressed plants  while wild-type and vector control plants showed only ~30% reduction compared to non-stressed plants. since the arabidopsis sos <dig> gene has been very well shown to impart salinity tolerance  <cit> , this data validates the usefulness of this protocol for salinity tolerance studies. leaf disks from nbp5cs1-, nbmyc2-, ntrar1-, nbctr1- and ntmek1-silenced plants showed about a 60% reduction in growth over corresponding non-stressed plants. further, leaf disks from nbgst-, nbcat3-, nbdhar-, nbgpx-, ntnpr1-, nbmc-, nbcycd2-, nbwrky1- and nbmyb1-silenced plants also showed around 40-50% reduction in growth, suggesting the relevance of these genes in salinity tolerance. involvement of p5cs <dig>  myc <dig>  ctr <dig>  mek <dig>  cat, dhar, gpx, npr <dig>  cycd <dig>  wrky <dig> and myb <dig> genes in salinity tolerance has been shown earlier  <cit> . in addition to these, our results also suggest the plausible role of mc in salt tolerance. another interesting observation that we made was the higher susceptibility of ntrar1-silenced plants to salinity, a gene mainly implicated in disease resistance  <cit> , indicating that rar <dig> may play a positive role under salinity stress.

high and low temperature stress
high and low temperature stress tolerances of gene-silenced and control plants were assessed by measuring cell membrane stability   <cit> . under high temperature stress , leaf disks obtained from nbhsp101-silenced plants showed a high reduction  in cms while the leaf disks from vector control plants had only 20% reduction . this reduction in cms in silenced plants was highly correlated with reduced transcript levels of hsp <dig>  semi-quantitative rt-pcr results showed  <dig> -fold reduction in hsp <dig> transcripts in silenced plants when compared to vector control plants . several gene-silenced leaf disks also showed significant reduction in their membrane stability. among them, about 60% reduction was found in the leaf disks from the nbapx-, nbmyc2-, nbmc-, nbwrky1-, nbwrky2- and nbetr1-silenced plants. this data indicate that nbhsp <dig> plays an important role in thermotolerance and is consistent with the previous reports  <cit> . furthermore, our results show that the genes like myc <dig>  wrky <dig> and etr <dig> that are known to play a role in various other abiotic stresses  <cit>  might also play a role in thermotolerance.

under low temperature stress , leaf disks from nbapx-, nbbip5-, nbp5cs1-, nbpal1- and nbwrky1-silenced plants showed higher membrane damage compared to control plants . however, cms of leaf disks from other gene-silenced plants studied did not significantly differ from the vector control plants. nbapx-, nbbip5-, nbp5cs1-, nbpal1- and nbwrky1-silenced plants showed susceptibility to both high and low temperature stresses, suggesting that these genes may have a general role in protecting the cell membrane during stresses.

oxidative stress
leaf disks from the gene-silenced plants were subjected to oxidative stress by incubating them on menadione-supplemented cim for callus growth assay. callus growth of leaf disks from nbgpx-silenced plants showed the largest reduction in weight  compared to vector control  . gpx has been previously implicated in regulating ros during oxidative stress  <cit> . in addition, leaf disks from plants silenced for other known oxidative stress associated genes like apx, cat <dig> and dhar also showed 30-45% growth reduction. our results support previous findings that showed involvement of apx <cit> , cat <cit> , dhar <cit> , sos <dig> <cit> , hsp <dig> <cit> , p5cs <dig> <cit> , myc <dig> <cit> , pal <dig> <cit> , mek <dig> <cit>  and fls <dig> <cit>  in oxidative stress, thus validating the usefulness of this assay in studying genes associated with oxidative stress. furthermore, among other assayed plants which showed significant reduction in growth, for the first time we suggest the involvement of rbx <dig> and ctr <dig> in oxidative stress. taken together, we demonstrated that vigs in combination with callus growth assay is useful for characterizing genes imparting oxidative stress tolerance.

assessing the response of gene-silenced plants to host and nonhost bacterial pathogen infection
abiotic stress tolerance pathways adapted by plants are known to share a significant overlap with pathways involved in plant-pathogen interactions  <cit> . hence, apart from abiotic stress tolerance, we also studied responses of the  <dig> gene-silenced plants to pathogen infection. two leaves of each gene-silenced plant were spot-inoculated with either a host pathogen, pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci, or nonhost pathogens p. syringae pv. tomato t <dig> and xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria expressing gfpuv <cit> . growth of these bacterial pathogens in the inoculated spots was visualized using uv light under dark. host pathogen-inoculated spots showed green fluorescent signals reflecting the bacterial colonies. greater variation in host pathogen growth was observed among different gene-silenced plants . nonhost-pathogen-inoculated spots in the wild-type and the vector control plant leaves did not produce any green fluorescence signal as the nonhost resistance mechanism was fully functional in these plants. in addition to bacterial growth under uv light, visual observations were also made to note disease symptoms . apart from confirming the involvement of several genes such as eds <dig>  rar <dig> and adr <dig> in plant disease resistance as reported before, our results also suggest the plausible role of sos <dig> and hsp <dig>  which are mainly associated with abiotic stresses, in biotic stress tolerance.

identification of genes involved in multi-stress tolerance
simulated drought, salinity and oxidative stress responses were tested by incubating leaf disks collected from gene-silenced, wild-type and vector control plants on ms medium supplemented with either peg or nacl or menadione, respectively. this assay was performed on ms medium for the convenience of identifying a clear phenotype, which will be difficult on cim as callus induction and/or growth might interfere with the phenotype. pathogen response was assessed by inoculating gfpuv-expressing host pathogen p. syringae pv. tabaci and two nonhost pathogens, p. syringae pv. tomato t <dig> and x. campestris pv. vesicatoria, and visualizing the bacterial growth by gfp fluorescence under uv light. leaf disks from wild-type and vector control plants incubated on abiotic stress medium were healthy and green for about two weeks. however, leaf disks from gene-silenced plants showed various phenotypes including discoloration, spotted cell death and wrinkling. a representative phenotype of leaf disks from nbsos1-silenced plants is shown in additional file 2a. similarly, during pathogen infection, wild-type non-inoculated and vector control plants did show disease symptoms to host pathogen p. syringae pv. tabaci, but severe disease symptoms were observed in some of the gene-silenced plants. some of the gene-silenced plants also supported the growth of nonhost pathogens p. syringae pv. tomato t <dig> and x. campestris pv. vesicatoria, while no bacterial growth was observed in wild-type non-inoculated and vector control plants. a representative disease phenotype of nbgpx-silenced plants is shown in additional file 2b. phenotypic responses were recorded for each gene-silenced leaf disk/plant separately exposed to various different abiotic and biotic stresses .

most of the gene-silenced leaf disks showed susceptibility to salinity and oxidative stress , indicating that these two stresses are regulated by a wide range of genes. interestingly, only a few gene-silenced leaf disks were susceptible to low temperature stress. this may indicate the unique nature of this stress effect and reciprocating plant response. nbgst-, nbwrky1-, ntmek1- and nbmyb1-silenced leaf disks showed susceptibility to a wide range of stresses studied. nbp5cs1-silenced leaf disks were susceptible to all abiotic stresses studied. more interestingly,  <dig> out of  <dig> genes that were previously implicated to play a role in abiotic stress tolerance– when individually silenced the plants were more susceptible to at least one host or nonhost pathogen infection . in addition to identifying new genes not previously implicated in biotic or abiotic stress tolerance, our results also confirmed the previous findings that showed the involvement of some of these genes in both biotic and abiotic stresses. for example, arabidopsis activation tagged lines constitutively expressing adr <dig> exhibited resistance against broad spectrum virulent pathogens through sa-dependent activation of defense genes  <cit>  and also showed tolerance to drought stress through sa-dependent activation of drought stress-related genes such as dreb2a <cit> . the adr <dig> mediated drought tolerance in arabidopsis needed eds <dig> <cit> , a gene that plays a role in disease resistance  <cit> . these results suggested the role of adr <dig> and eds <dig> in both biotic and abiotic stresses. also in our study, both adr1- and eds1-silenced plants showed susceptibility to osmotic stress as well as pathogen infection. gst is also known to be involved in both biotic and abiotic stresses. silencing of nbgstu <dig> in n. benthamiana showed significantly higher lesions and more colonization by colletotrichum orbiculare <cit> . the role gsts during abiotic stress tolerance mainly through detoxification of ros has been suggested. overexpression of gst along with gpx in tobacco enhanced seedling growth under salt stress and also reduced oxidative damage  <cit> . in our study gst1-silenced plants showed susceptibility to salinity, oxidative stress, osmotic stress and pathogen infection thus confirming the role of gst in both biotic and abiotic stresses. these findings further suggest the existence of common mechanisms underlying tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses. other genes which are commonly required for tolerance to both abiotic and biotic stresses include regulatory genes like transcription factors. for example, the nbwrky1-silenced leaf disks showed moderate susceptibility to salt, high temperature and peg-induced osmotic stresses while nbmyc2-silenced leaf disks were moderately susceptible to salt, high temperature and oxidative stresses. in addition, these silenced plants were also more susceptible to host and nonhost pathogens. the other regulatory gene-silenced leaf disks like ntrar <dig>  ntnpr <dig> and nbctr <dig> also showed susceptibility to both abiotic and biotic stresses. these results indicate that the high-throughput vigs methodology used here to study abiotic stress tolerance can also be used to dissect mechanisms involved in multi-stress tolerance of plants.

validating the function of specific genes at the whole plant level
in order to validate the results obtained from the leaf disk assays, we chose four genes to confirm their role in stress tolerance at the whole plant level. nbp5cs <dig>  nteds <dig>  nbhsp <dig> and nbsos <dig> genes were individually silenced in n. benthamiana. down-regulation of target genes in respective gene-silenced plants was confirmed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr . these gene-silenced plants were then individually subjected to various abiotic stresses at the whole plant level, and their responses were recorded as below.

water deficit stress
p5cs <dig> has been shown to impart water deficit stress tolerance in plants by facilitating enhanced biosynthesis and accumulation of proline  <cit> . therefore, we selected nbp5cs1-silenced plants for imposing water deficit stress at the whole plant level. similarly, the ateds <dig> has been implicated in resistance against powdery mildew disease caused by erysiphe necator <cit>  and water deficit stress tolerance  <cit> . our results also showed that the nteds <dig> gene is important for basal resistance against host pathogen p. syringae pv. tabaci . further, the leaf disk assay and detached leaf assay showed that nteds1-silenced plants were highly susceptible to osmotic stress  and dehydration stress , respectively. therefore, we also studied the response of nteds1-silenced plants under water deficit stress at the whole plant level.

photosynthetic performance of nbp5cs1- and nteds1-silenced plants maintained under water deficit stress of 50% fc was measured. nbp5cs1- and nteds1-silenced plants independently showed more than 80% reduction in photosynthetic efficiency over non-stressed plants compared to only a 50% reduction in control plants . these data suggest that the photosynthetic machinery is greatly impaired in these gene-silenced plants upon drought stress. less reduction in photosynthetic efficiency under stress is one of the mechanisms adapted by stress tolerant plants to cope with the water deficit stress  <cit> . hence, greater reduction in the photosynthetic efficiency in the nbp5cs1- and nteds1-silenced plants reflects the relevance of these two genes in water deficit stress tolerance. taken together, these results validate the vigs methodology developed for studying water deficit or dehydration or osmotic stress tolerance.

salinity stress
we selected the nbsos <dig> gene in order to validate our salinity screening assays. nbsos1-silenced whole plants were irrigated with saltwater by gradually increasing salt concentration from  <dig> to 300 mm at 5-day intervals. salinity stress response was assessed at the end of the stress period by measuring photosynthesis. nbsos <dig> silenced plants under salt stress showed reduced growth compared to corresponding control plants, and no growth differences were observed under non-stress conditions . consistent with our observations, the growth of the sos <dig> arabidopsis mutant was inhibited by high na +  <cit> . in addition to growth reduction, raised pustules  were observed on the adaxial surface of nbsos1-silenced n. benthamiana leaves . since salt tolerance of plants depends on the ability to exclude na + from the shoot and maintain a low cellular na+/k + ratio  <cit> , one of the reasons for the susceptibility of silenced plants to salt might be the disruption of na + homeostasis in the cell. salt has been previously shown to inhibit photosynthesis  <cit> , and slsos <dig> overexpression in tomato prevented na + from reaching the photosynthetic tissues by extruding na + out of the root and also retaining na + in the stems  <cit> . consistent with this, nbsos1-silenced n. benthamiana plants exposed to salt stress in this study showed about 10% reduction in photosynthetic efficiency .

high temperature stress
nbhsp101-silenced whole plants exposed to high temperature stress showed less membrane stability compared to corresponding vector control plants . consistently, arabidopsis hot mutants with reduced thermotolerance, expressing lower levels of athsp <dig>  had higher membrane damage under high temperature stress  <cit> . hsp <dig> is an important chaperon protein known to be involved in imparting thermotolerance in plants  <cit> . overexpression of athsp <dig> has been shown to improve thermotolerance in rice  <cit> . since high temperature stress predominantly affects the membrane characteristics, membrane stability assay is commonly used to assess the stress response of plants  <cit> . susceptibility of nbhsp101-silenced plants to high temperature validates the results from leaf disk experiments that showed a similar trend .

CONCLUSIONS
during functional characterization and genetic manipulation studies of plants for stress tolerance, apart from testing a candidate gene under particular stress, it is important to screen them for broad spectrum stress tolerance  <cit> . these screens will not only help to identify the appropriate genes that impart tolerance to multiple stresses, but will also allow researchers to test susceptibility, if any, to other stresses  <cit> . these notions mandate quick and authoritative forward and reverse genetics assays for testing the relevance of a particular gene under multiple stresses. despite its potential, a vigs-based transient gene silencing system has not been used before for large-scale screening either to identify genes involved in abiotic stress tolerance or to dissect multi-stress tolerance. as depicted in figure  <dig>  we propose a methodology, utilizing vigs in leaf disks combined with simple stress effect quantification methodologies, that will pave the way for such screening in the future. this methodology will facilitate identification of a single gene that can impart multi-stress tolerance or tolerance to specific stress with no negative effect on other stresses. using this methodology, as a proof of concept, we screened  <dig> genes and identified genes that are important for imparting tolerance to various abiotic stresses and disease resistance. a few interesting findings from this screen which have not been shown before are the involvement of nbrbx <dig> and nbctr <dig> in oxidative stress; ntrar <dig> and ntnpr <dig> in salinity stress; and nbsos <dig> and nbhsp <dig> in biotic stress. in addition to identifying genes involved in multi-stress tolerance, for the first time we demonstrate that vigs can be effectively used to assess the relevance of genes involved in thermotolerance. the methodology described in this manuscript will be useful for large-scale testing of genes involved in thermotolerance pathways. our results suggest the involvement of nteds <dig>  nbetr <dig>  nbwrky <dig> and nbmyc <dig> in thermotolerance.

the vigs-mediated high throughput methodology that we have described in this manuscript has several advantages to analyze the functional role of putative stress-induced genes. first, it allows precise stress imposition and quantification of stress effects using less sophisticated laboratory facilities with minimal growth chamber space and time. second, genes can be characterized in a high-throughput manner for multi-stress tolerance using a single plant as this methodology requires less plant material. third, experiments can be repeated multiple times since the duration of the whole experiment is shorter than whole plant assays. the limitation of this methodology is that it will only suggest the possible role of a gene under a particular stress and necessitates the study at whole plant level for further confirmation.
