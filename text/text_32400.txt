BACKGROUND
tumourigenesis is associated with the acquisition of genomic aberrations  <cit>  including copy number alterations  and loss of heterozygosity , which activate oncogenes or deactivate various classes of genes that play crucial roles in cancer development  <cit> . previously, such data has been generated from array comparative genomic hybridisation  and single nucleotide polymorphism  genotyping arrays  but the implementation of massively parallel sequencing  technologies has provided novel opportunities for using sequencing data to generate equivalent genomic aberration information. in the cancer genomics field it has become a routine to perform whole genome sequencing  or whole exome sequencing  on dna extracted from tumour tissues  <cit> . wes is particularly popular for large sequencing projects seeking to identify disease-specific mutations since it is significantly cheaper than wgs and involves reduced analytical complexity, but typically seeks only to identify single nucleotide variants and small insertions-deletions  <cit> . cnas have been successfully detected in gene panel targeted resequencing projects  <cit> , however, the bioinformatics tools for upscaling this to exomes are lacking. with the efforts of large sequencing consortia, such as the cancer genome atlas  network and international cancer genome consortium   <cit>  and individual research groups, many whole exome sequencing projects involving thousands of tumours are currently underway. however, somatic cna identification by means of wes data is still in its early stages and needs the development of new robust computational methods and algorithms.

computational methods have been published for detecting cnas in targeted resequencing data including whole exome sequencing , although majority of these methods are designed for analysing variations in germline dna and perform poorly when applied to the detection of somatic cnas in tumour samples. control-freec  <cit>  is a method developed for wgs tumour data and more recently supports the application to wes data. exomecnv  <cit>  and varscan  <dig>  <cit>  are designed for cna identification in tumour wes data, however, they do not predict absolute copy number in non-diploid samples. other methods can predict absolute copy numbers in non-diploid tumour samples, but only if the ploidy is known a priori
 <cit>  which is rarely the case or is impractical to obtain.

simultaneous generation of depth of coverage  ratios and b allele frequencies  would facilitate the identification of aneuploidy and polyploidy present in cancer samples. a diploid genome would only have bafs of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  corresponding to aa, ab and bb genotypes, whereas, for example, a triploid genome, assuming no tumour heterogeneity or normal contamination, would have allele ratios of  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> regions corresponding to aaa, aab, abb and bbb genotypes and a baseline doc ratio of one which is similar to a diploid tumour genome. to generate ratios and allele frequencies from wes data, we need to align them to the reference genome and identify the snps. another issue impeding the use of wgs and wes for somatic cna identification is non-tumour cell contamination, which is present in the majority of tumour tissues. normal dna contamination attenuates the signal-to-noise ratio in baf and coverage ratio signals by altering their values towards a normal diploid genome pattern. consequently, a high normal cell contamination would make it impossible to differentially detect somatic variations in tumour cells. among the previously published methods, exomecnv  <cit>  requires tumour purity to be known a priori while control-freec  <cit>  does not. previous studies on snp genotyping array data  <cit>  suggested the use of hidden markov models  to predict cna and loh events with a parameter training procedure, which inherently models the normal contamination.

when analysing exome sequencing data, it is important to overcome the intrinsic noise present in data itself, which hinders its ability to accurately predict cnas. programs such as xhmm  <cit>  and conifer  <cit> , which are applicable to cna detection in germline dna studies, perform principle component analysis and singular value decomposition, to remove the noise present in wes data and normalise the read counts. however, these methods are not applicable in single tumour/matched normal sample pairs. a potential way to overcome this issue is to implement discrete wavelet transformation  in normalising exome ratios as we have reported previously  <cit> . dwt normalisation can achieve higher precision  while maintaining a comparable or superior sensitivity compared to other methods.

overall, the three above mentioned issues,  noise in wes data,  ploidy and  normal cell contamination in tumour samples have not been simultaneously evaluated by any of the computational methods applicable to wes tumour data. although our previously proposed method  <cit>  considers these three issues, it requires prior knowledge of contamination and tumour ploidy. therefore, in the current study, we propose a new approach named aberration detection in tumour exome , which automatically estimates the three aspects important to wes tumour data and predicts cna events and genotypes of snps associated with these regions. further, adtex makes explicit predictions on chromosome arm level cna events, which is a pattern commonly observed across many tumour types.

RESULTS
adtex for aberration detection in tumour exome
adtex consists of two hmms to predict copy number alterations and genotypes in wes data of paired tumour/normal samples. two types of signals were generated from the exome data, doc ratios and bafs. copy number analysis using ratios can be complemented by the computation of bafs to determine ploidy and zygosity. here, we propose to apply these two types of signals to predict the zygosity state of segments in the genome targeted by exome capture.

one hmm is used to predict cnas, which in combination with baf signal can be used to estimate ploidy of the tumour and predict the absolute copy numbers. a second hmm is used to predict zygosity or genotype of each cna segment. the overall framework of the method is given in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  we applied our method to  <dig> in-house tumour samples derived from ovarian cancer patients to assess the performance of the method. we selected ten samples with different aberration types from those  <dig> samples to compare the performance of adtex against existing somatic cna prediction methods. further, we evaluated the performance of adtex on publicly available  <dig> paired ovarian cancer/normal samples downloaded from the tcga project.

the parameters in our two hmms were trained using an expectation maximisation  algorithm  <cit> . given these estimated parameters, the maximum likelihood of the hidden state sequence is determined using viterbi algorithm  <cit> . in the first hmm, to detect copy number, we applied em algorithm for each chromosome separately, while in the second hmm, we pooled all chromosomes and estimated parameters jointly. however, in the second hmm, the initial state distribution was computed separately for each chromosome.

aberrations detection in  <dig> ovarian cancer samples
we used  <dig> paired ovarian tumour/normal samples to evaluate the performance of our proposed method . the samples were sequenced on an illumina hiseq  <dig>  and the illumina genome analyzer iix . exon capture was performed using the 51 mb agilent sureselect human all exon v <dig> , the  <dig>  mb roche nimblegen ez exome seqcap v <dig>  and the 26 mb roche nimblegen ez exome seqcap v <dig> platform . each wes sample was aligned to the reference genome, grch <dig>  using bwa  <cit> . the predicted aberrations in exome samples were validated by affymetrix snp  <dig>  data generated for the same samples. ascat  <cit>  was used to predict cnas from the snp array data.table  <dig>

correlation between snp array data and wes data
manual inspection of the ratio plots between snp  <dig>  array data and whole exome sequencing data proved to be highly consistent. we also observed statistically significant positive correlation  between snp  <dig>  data ratios and exome depth of coverage ratios. to obtain these, we partitioned the exome into windows containing five exons and computed the mean normalised doc ratios in each partitioned window. mean snp  <dig>  intensity ratios were calculated from the probes overlapping the exonic windows. the spearman’s rank correlation was calculated between these two data sets for three different tumour samples  and the spearman’s rho ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . this evaluation demonstrates that wes is comparable with snp  <dig>  array data for the analysis of cnas.

polyploidy detection in exome data
to predict the copy number of each exonic locus, we first needed to establish a method for predicting the polyploidy status of each tumour sample. additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows the properties of baf to detect correct ploidy by our method. in each case, adtex accurately determined the copy number status of the regions corresponding to baseline ratio, by comparing bafs and predicted copy number. this estimation is only possible when the bafs of the tumour sample at normal heterozygous loci are available, doc ratios alone would not allow correcting for this.

overall, prediction accuracies of the ploidy detection were measured by calling copy number at each exonic locus and validating them against the calls made by ascat on snp  <dig>  array data .figure  <dig>

comparison with snp genotyping array data
cna were evident in  <dig> of the  <dig> samples, which were therefore used to evaluate the performance of cna predictions. loh was predicted in all  <dig> samples , which were therefore used in the genotype prediction evaluation. a representative comparison between exome results and snp  <dig>  results are shown in figure 1a for the sample ov <dig> 

we evaluated adtex predicted cnas against those predicted by ascat on snp  <dig>  array data, which we assumed as the ground truths. sensitivity, specificity, precision and accuracy were computed for each sample . each exon was treated as a point of measure for the performance calculation with true positives  considered those exons identified by both ascat and adtex as gains/losses and false positives  considered those exons predicted by adtex as gains/losses and copy neutral by ascat. true negatives  and false negatives  were recognised in the same manner. adtex had median values of  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity, 94% precision and 98% accuracy for detecting cnas. triploidy and tetraploidy were each present in  <dig> of  <dig> samples while most of other samples were aneuploid . as shown in additional file 1: figure s5a, a high proportion of the genome was affected by duplications with an average of  <dig> % of the genome amplified compared with just 4% deleted. the smallest deletion and amplification detected by adtex were 100pb and 80 bp long respectively, while the largest deletion and amplification were 181mbp and 243mbp in length respectively. the resolution of the smallest cna detected was restricted to the smallest exon detected as a cna.

for large scale  cna events, we further assessed the performance of adtex based on the number of events detected by the method. according to the results from snp arrays, there were  <dig> large scale events in all samples . adtex detected  <dig> events, which is a sensitivity of  <dig> %. for the assessment, an event predicted by ascat is considered to be correctly detected by adtex when there is more than 50% overlap between the predictions made by two methods.

figure 1c shows the performance measurements of adtex on loh predictions, evaluated considering ascat predictions as ground truths . the heterozygous snp loci in matched normal sample were retained for this analysis. further, we filtered out the snp loci that fell outside of the regions of the predicted copy number variant and copy neutral segments for the relevant sample. each snp locus was considered as a performance measurement point with true positives considered those snp loci identified as having loh by both ascat and adtex and false positive events considered those snp loci defined by ascat as non-loh but predicted by adtex as loh. median values of sensitivity and specificity were  <dig> % and  <dig> %.

the distribution of the total length of loh of a sample ranged from a minimum of  <dig>  mb to maximum of  <dig>  mb with a mean of 273 mb. additional file 1: figure s5b shows the distribution of the genomic proportion of allelic imbalance presents in each sample. additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows different types of loh events identified using adtex on whole exome sequencing data.

performance metrics for detecting allele specific copy number alterations  were reported as median sensitivity of  <dig> % and specificity of  <dig> % and are summarised in additional file 1: table s <dig> in terms of sensitivity, specificity, precision and accuracy.

performance evaluation on tcga data
next, we evaluated the performance of adtex on high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinoma samples sequenced as part of tcga project  <cit> . we downloaded bam files of  <dig> paired tumour/normal samples sequenced at washington university from the cancer genomics hub . these were sequenced using illumina genome analyzer iix and target capture was performed by agilent sureselect human exome platform. all samples have been aligned to the grch37-lite. the number of reads mapped to the targeted regions ranged from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> .

to evaluate the somatic cna detection of adtex, we also downloaded the raw affymetrix snp  <dig>  files of the same samples from tcga data portal. then, as before, we carried out cna detection on snp  <dig>  data using ascat algorithm  <cit> . these results were treated as the ground truths for the evaluation. each sample has very high aberration rate with focal and large scale cnas, typical of this tumour type.

in detecting somatic cna, adtex showed median sensitivity of  <dig> %, precision  <dig> % and f-measure of  <dig> %. f measure was computed using the following equation.
  

the largest detected cna segment was  <dig> ,351 bp long in length and smallest detected cna was 120 bp long. on average  <dig>  cna segments per tumour were detected by adtex . in all samples,  <dig>  exons were identified as losses and  <dig> , <dig> exons were identified as gains. therefore, for each tumour sample there were about  <dig>  altered exons and this number is consistent with the reported values  <cit>  for ovarian cancer samples. sensitivity, precision and f-measure for detecting loh were computed as  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively, relative to ascat predictions.

comparison with other copy number predicting algorithms
methods compared
in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we carried out a comparison between adtex and other somatic cna detecting algorithms. we selected exomecnv  <cit> , varscan  <dig>  <cit>  and control-freec  <cit>  for the comparison as they were developed for wes data generated from paired tumour/normal samples. further, we evaluated the performance of our previous work described in amarasinghe et al.,  <dig>  <cit>  and details of the evaluation are given below separately in the section “comparison with previous work”. we selected ten samples from a in-house data set, with different copy number aberrations to compare the competing methods. these samples contain focal aberrations, chromosome arm-level and full chromosomal events. in all cases we used samtools pileup/mpileup  <cit>  to generate coverage files as inputs for the three competing exome based methods. supplementary methods section in additional file  <dig> describes the parameter settings used with each method.

results from the comparison study
the overall performance of the four methods is shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  additional file 1: table s <dig> gives the performance matrix of each method on each sample. varscan <dig> does not predict the absolute copy number, instead it predicts gains/losses and copy neutral regions. accordingly, in figure 2a, varscan <dig> result shows losses, neutral regions, and gains as having copy  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  figure 2b shows the performance metrics of each method in terms of sensitivity, specificity, precision and accuracy. we were particularly interested in sensitivity  and precision  as the performance measures to base our comparison. therefore, we report the f measure values here.figure  <dig>

in the table, bold value in each line represents the best value of each performance measure.

the calculated mean  f-measure values for adtex, exomecnv, varscan <dig> and control-freec were  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  respectively. overall, both mean and median performance scores of adtex were better compared to other methods. varscan <dig> ranked second and adtex showed 12% increase in terms of mean f measure over varscan <dig>  as per the table  <dig>  adtex showed superior or comparable performance in terms of mean and median values of all performance measures compared to other competing methods. the main reason for superior results produced by adtex compared to other methods is that it simultaneously evaluates specific characteristics of tumour wes data, namely  noise,  ploidy and  normal cell contamination.

figure 2a shows the copy number predictions of the four methods on chromosome  <dig> for the sample ov <dig>  interestingly, control-freec appeared to misidentify the normal regions as it misjudged the baseline of the ratios, resulting in the prediction of copy neutral regions as amplifications and deletions as copy neutral.

comparison of small cnas
snp genotyping arrays cannot be used to detect smaller-size cnas  due to limited resolution. to assess the performance at this level, we compared smaller  cnas detected by adtex with three other exome based methods. overall, adtex, exomecnv, varscan  <dig> and control-freec detected  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cna events, respectively, of which 79%, 94%, 93% and 82% were identified as smaller than 1mb. identification of high percentages of smaller events by all four methods can be attributed to the sparse nature of wes data. as adtex performs noise reduction in wes data, many of the smaller cnas predicted by other three methods are integrated into larger cnas predicted by adtex. the overlap between other methods and  <dig> smaller cnas identified by adtex is given in additional file 1: table s <dig>  varscan  <dig> identified  <dig> of those events, which has the highest concordance rate.

comparison of loh and ascna predictions
control-freec predicts loh and ascna events similar to adtex, hence we compared adtex loh and ascna predictions against the results from control-freec . five samples with different variations were chosen to carry out the comparison. adtex outperformed control-freec in terms of precision and f-measure. the mean f-measure and precision of adtex were calculated respectively as  <dig> % and  <dig> % while that of control-freec were  <dig> % and  <dig> % with respect to loh predictions. the mean f-measure and precision values for ascna predictions were  <dig> % and  <dig> % for adtex and  <dig> % and  <dig> % for control-freec respectively.table  <dig>

comparison with previous work
we described a copy number predicting algorithm in amarasinghe et al.,  <dig>  <cit> . the main differences between current work and the algorithm in amarasinghe et al.,  <dig>  <cit>  are i) no a priori knowledge of contamination or ploidy is required and ii) genotype status of snps in each of the cna segment predicted by adtex. we evaluated the performance of amarasinghe et al.,  <dig>  <cit>  using the ten samples in the comparison study and also applied the method on triploid sample ov <dig> . the ploidy and contamination values were chosen based on manual confirmation and prediction made by ascat  <cit>  on snp  <dig>  data of the same samples. for the ten diploid samples we saw 4% and 5% increases in median precision and f-measure values respectively for adtex compared to amarasinghe et al.,  <dig>  <cit> . further, for the ov <dig> sample adtex showed clear improvements in terms of sensitivity, specificity, precision and accuracy.

evaluation of the effect of normal cell contamination
we carried out computer simulations to evaluate the effect of normal cell contamination on cna and loh predictions by adtex. we use ov <dig> data sample to generate different combination of data sets with  <dig>  to  <dig>  normal cell contamination and read depths of 150x , 60x and 400x. the original normal cell contamination is predicted as 25%, therefore the expected contamination levels can be calculated as  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. for original coverage, adtex accurately predicted the normal cell contamination up to  <dig>  . additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows the changes in the predicted values. the f measure performance on cna predictions  was reported taking the snp  <dig>  results as ground truths. relatively high f measure value is maintained  at the  <dig>  contamination level for cna detection. the f measure performance of loh predictions  suggests adtex performed well even at  <dig>  normal cell contamination level . at high levels of contamination , prediction of cna is difficult due to the very low level of variation in the depth of coverage ratios. further, 150x and 400x coverage showed better performance compared to 60x coverage.

chromosome arm level copy number aberrations
chromosome arm level or full chromosomal cnas are commonly observed across many tumour types  <cit> . different tumour types have been reported to have recurrent arm level events on different chromosomes. for example gain in chromosome  <dig> or 3q are more common in cervical cancer while loss of chromosome  <dig> is common in glioblastomas  <cit> .

adtex explicitly predicts chromosome arm level events based on the results generated by exon level copy number predictions. the distribution of doc ratios of copy neutral regions is calculated from the exon level result. then, statistical confidence level  for each chromosome arm considering the mean doc ratio is produced based on the calculated distribution. at the  <dig>  confidence level we were able to detect  <dig> chromosome p/q level events  and  <dig> full chromosome cna events  in the  <dig> in-house ovarian tumour samples. according to the carefully curated list of chromosome arm level cnas  in those ovarian cancer samples, adtex showed 96% sensitivity and 99% specificity. four single copy losses and one single copy gain residing in samples with higher ploidy were not detected as significant compared to copy neutral level.

CONCLUSIONS
we have described a new approach to infer somatic cnas and genotype states in wes data from tumour samples. our method both models and evaluates tumour related attributes in wes data. further, the proposed method explicitly predicts chromosome arm level cna events, which are commonly found in many tumour types. we implemented this approach in a software called “aberration detection in tumour exome ”, which is freely available under gnu general public licence v <dig> . to our knowledge, adtex is the first attempt to computationally derive absolute copy numbers and genotypes using wes data from tumour samples without any a priori knowledge of levels of normal dna contamination or ploidy of the tumour samples. the algorithm takes doc ratios and bafs as inputs and models them using gaussian distribution. prior to applying hmm to derive cnas and genotypes, the doc ratios are smoothed by discrete wavelet transformation techniques. we applied the algorithm to  <dig>  paired ovarian tumour/normal samples captured using three different targeted capture platforms and sequenced using illumina genome analyzer ii or hiseq <dig> sequencers. further, to our knowledge adtex is the only method that predicts chromosome arm level cna in wes data.

we demonstrated the superior performance of adtex compared to existing methods. most importantly, we compared the performance of adtex against the results generated by ascat on affymetrix snp  <dig>  data and showed that our method can produce results consistent with snp array data, the gold standard for detecting cnas. we believe that the integrated cna and loh predictions in adtex will greatly improve the type and usefulness of the data generated in large wes studies.

however, we have not addressed the issue of tumour heterogeneity where some components of the tumour biopsy will have different clonal outgrows harbouring different genetic alterations. clonal heterogeneity will result in an amalgamation of the signals present in both subpopulations which may result in a reduced sensitivity of adtex. this could be a future research direction that can be pursued using wes data.
