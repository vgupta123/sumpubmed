BACKGROUND
specific atp-binding cassette  type transporters are involved in acquisition of essential iron in various forms in bacterial pathogens. the substrate-binding component of the abc transporters specifically binds free fe3+, ferric siderophore complex, or heme, which is transported across the cytoplasmic membrane by the permease component using the energy from the hydrolysis of atp catalyzed by the atpase component  <cit> . the human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes produces three abc transporters, ftsabcd  <cit> , htsabc or siaabc  <cit> , and mtsabc  <cit> , which acquire ferric ferrichrome, heme, and fe3+ and mn2+, respectively. expression of htsabc and mtsabc are negatively regulated by the same metalloregulator mtsr in response to levels of fe only and fe or mn, respectively  <cit> .

heme is abundant in mammalian hosts and a preferred iron source for bacterial pathogens  <cit> . besides heme-specific abc transporters, cell surface heme-binding proteins are required for heme acquisition in gram-positive pathogens. these proteins have been identified in s. pyogenes  <cit> , staphylococcus aureus  <cit> , and streptococcus equi  <cit> . heme is usually bound to host proteins at extremely high affinities  <cit> . furthermore, gram-positive bacteria have thick cell walls, and heme-specific abc transporters are most likely buried in the cell wall. thus, heme acquisition machinery in gram-positive bacteria may have to have evolved mechanisms to overcome these obstacles in heme acquisition, i.e. inability of host hemoproteins to reach the abc transporters and the extremely high affinity of host proteins for heme. the cell surface heme-binding proteins are believed to have evolved to overcome these obstacles in heme acquisition in gram-positive pathogens. however, how these proteins are involved in heme acquisition is largely unknown.

s. pyogenes is capable of utilizing heme derived from human hemoproteins as a source of iron  <cit> . the heme acquisition machinery in s. pyogenes is believed to consist of shr, shp, and htsabc. shp and htsabc are the cell surface heme-binding protein and heme-specific abc transporter, respectively  <cit> . shr, another cell surface protein, is proposed to be a receptor of host hemoproteins  <cit> ; however, its function has not been firmly established. we have been studying the s. pyogenes heme acquisition machinery as a model system for understanding the heme acquisition process in gram-positive pathogens. shp rapidly and directly transfers its heme to htsa, the lipoprotein component of htsabc, in a concerted two-step process with one kinetic phase  <cit> . the structure of the shp heme-binding domain reveals that the shp heme iron is ligated to met <dig> and met <dig>  <cit> , and the met axial ligands are both important for rapid heme transfer from shp to htsa  <cit> . however, the heme source of shp is not known.

we have proposed that shp functions to relay heme from host proteins or another s. pyogenes heme-binding protein to htsabc  <cit> . in this study, we found that the rates of ferric heme transfer from oxidized hemoglobin  to heme-free shp  are similar to those for the dissociation of ferric heme from methemoglobin, suggesting that shp cannot directly acquire heme from methemoglobin and that shp may mainly acquire heme from another s. pyogenes protein. we hypothesize that this protein is shr. to test this hypothesis, recombinant shr was prepared and characterized. we found that shr indeed binds heme and, more interestingly, efficiently transfers it to shp but inefficiently to htsa. these findings suggest the possibility that shr is the heme source of shp and that heme transfer from shr to shp is part of the heme acquisition process in s. pyogenes.

RESULTS
shp appears to indirectly acquire ferric heme from methemoglobin
heme-binding form of shp  was formed in the incubation of aposhp with human methemoglobin  <cit> . it was not known whether the formation of holoshp was due to direct heme transfer from methemoglobin or indirect scavenge of ferric heme dissociated from methemoglobin. to examine this issue, the rate for formation of holoshp was compared with that of heme dissociation from methemoglobin. limited methemoglobin  was incubated with  <dig> to  <dig> μm aposhp at 25°c, and the formation of holoshp was monitored by absorbance change at  <dig> and  <dig> nm, which present the loss and gain of heme by methemoglobin and aposhp, respectively. the time courses of normalized absorbance change, Δ, fit a two exponential equation , but not a single exponential equation . fitting of the data to a two exponential equation resulted in two first-order rate constants. the values of the rate constants did not change significantly with  from  <dig> to  <dig> μm, giving the mean values ± standard deviation of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s- <dig> for the rate constants of the fast and slow phases, respectively. the biphasic kinetics and rate constants are similar to those in the dissociation of heme from methemoglobin using h64y/v68f apomyoglobin as a heme scavenger  <cit> , in which the fast and slow phases are heme dissociation from the β and α subunits, respectively  <cit> . to confirm these similarities, the dissociation of heme from methemoglobin using h64y/v68f apomyoglobin was performed under the same conditions. Δ associated with the loss and gain of heme by methemoglobin and apomyoglobin, respectively, was kinetically biphasic with  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s- <dig> for the rate constants of the fast and slow phases, respectively . these rate constants are close to those in the methemoglobin/aposhp reaction. these results suggest that shp does not directly acquire heme from human methemoglobin.

recombinant shr protein
since shp appears not to directly acquire heme from methemoglobin, the heme source of shp may be a s. pyogenes protein. we speculated that this protein was shr. if this is true, shr should bind heme and transfer it to shp. to test this idea, we first prepared recombinant shr protein. in comparison with escherichia coli containing the empty vector, e. coli containing plasmid pet-his2-shr with the cloned shr gene displayed an extra band in sds page, which had approximately the expected molecular weight of shr  . the band was obvious but not dominant, indicating moderate expression of shr. the deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned shr gene has a 6xhis tag and predicted net charge of + <dig>  at ph  <dig> . as expected, the expressed protein bound to a cation exchange column of sp sepharose at ph  <dig>  and ni+-nta column. shr obtained had a purity of 80% according to the densities of the bands in sds-page analysis . to confirm that the protein purified was not an e. coli protein, the proteins of e. coli/pet-his <dig>  obtained using sp sepharose chromatography, the first step in the shr purification, was analyzed by sds page, and no protein with the size of shr was detected . the purified protein sample was also probed with convalescent sera from  <dig> patients of streptococcal pharyngitis and an individual without s. pyogenes exposure by western blotting analysis. all three patients, but not the control individual, had antibodies specific for the purified protein , further supporting that the purified protein was shr. thus, recombinant shr can be expressed at moderate levels in e. coli.

shr binds heme
the pellet of e. coli expressing shr was in light red color. purified shr was yellow and red at diluted and concentrated concentrations, respectively, while the proteins obtained from the control e. coli from the sp sepharose chromatography did not have absorption in the visible region, indicating that shr has an associated chromophore. in the presence of excess dithionite, the protein displays the absorption peaks at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nm , a spectrum typical of ferrous heme in a hexacoordinate form, indicating that the chromophore is heme. shr as isolated had a broad soret peak and the small resolved α band at  <dig> nm, suggesting that the protein was a mixture of ferric and ferrous heme complexes. to confirm this, the protein was incubated with ferricyanide, and excess ferricyanide was removed from the protein by a g- <dig> sepharose column. the soret peak of the ferricyaide-treated shr was indeed shifted to that of ferric heme complex , indicating that shr as isolated was a mixture of ferric and ferrous heme complexes. the results of the pyridine hemochrome assay further confirm that the chromophore is heme. the spectrum of the chromophore derived from shr in this assay was identical to the one of pyridine hemochrome derived from an authentic hemoprotein . the molar ratio of associated heme to shr was  <dig>  after adjustment according to the estimated purity of the purified shr. these results indicate that the chromophore associated with shr is heme and that shr can acquire heme from e. coli hemoproteins in vivo.

heme transfer from shr to aposhp
we next tested whether shr transfers its heme to aposhp. holoshr  and  <dig> μm aposhp were incubated for  <dig> min, and the two proteins were separated as described in the methods section. sds-page analysis confirmed the separation of the two proteins . holoshp was present in the isolated shp sample, as evidenced by the presence of absorption of bound heme . thus, aposhp gained heme in its reaction with shr. the ratio of a410/a <dig> of the treated shr was 29% of that of the starting shr . a <dig> is the absorbance of bound heme, and a <dig> is mainly the absorbance of the protein moiety. thus, a410/a <dig> can be used to approximately estimate relative levels of heme in the protein samples. the lower a410/a <dig> ratio of the treated shr indicates that shr lost heme in its reaction with aposhp. these results suggest that shr transfers its heme to aposhp.

shr does not efficiently transfer its heme to apohtsa
to test whether shr transfers its heme to apohtsa,  <dig> μm holoshr was incubated with  <dig> μm apohtsa or aposhp  for  <dig> min, and shr was isolated from the mixtures. the normalized spectrum of the isolated shr from its apohtsa mixture was compared with those of untreated shr and shr isolated from its mixture with aposhp. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the ratio of a410/a <dig> of shr from the shr/apohtsa reaction was decreased from  <dig>  to  <dig> , whereas the a410/a <dig> ratio of shr from the shr/aposhp reaction was lowered from  <dig>  to  <dig> . according the extinction coefficients of holoshr and aposhr at  <dig> and  <dig> nm and these a410/a <dig> ratios, shr lost 14% and 73% heme in its reactions with apohtsa and aposhp, respectively. these results indicate that shr transfers its heme to aposhp more efficiently than to apohtsa.

discussion
one of the major findings of this study is that shr binds heme. purified shr has a chromophore and displays a visible absorption spectrum typical of hemoproteins. reduction of shr with dithionite results in the spectrum typical of bound ferrous heme in a hexacoordinate complex. the hemochrome assay also resulted in hemochrome from shr. these findings indicate that shr binds heme and can acquire heme from e. coli hemoproteins.

andrade et al.  <cit>  identified a domain in genes near the components of a putative fe3+ siderophore transporter  from gram-positive pathogenic bacteria. it should be pointed out that the transporters in s. pyogenes and s. aureus referred in the work of andrade et al. were later found to be heme transporters  <cit> . shr, which was referred to s_pyog in this reference, has two neat domains. the neat domain in s. aureus surface proteins isda and isdc binds heme  <cit> , whereas the neat domain of idsh does not bind heme  <cit> , suggesting that the binding of heme to shr may be mediated by one or both neat domains.

another major finding is that shr appears to directly transfer its heme to aposhp. when shr was incubated with aposhp or apohtsa under the same conditions, the majority of shr lost heme to aposhp, but not to apohtsa. the apparent bimolecular rate constant for binding of ferric heme to apohtsa at low   is  <dig> times as that for binding of ferric heme to aposhp , and the association constant for htsa-ferric heme complex  is 5-fold greater than that for shp-ferric heme complex   <cit> . based on these previous kinetic and equilibrium constants, the efficient and inefficient heme transfer from shr to aposhp and from shr to apohtsa, respectively, suggests that shr directly transfers its heme to aposhp and indirectly and inefficiently to apohtsa. otherwise, shr would release heme into solvent, which should be caught more efficiently by apohtsa than aposhp, and shr should thus lose heme to apohtsa and aposhp at least to similar extent.

the dissociation of ferric heme from methemoglobin has been found to be a slow process with two kinetic phases using h64y/v68f apomyoglobin as a heme scavenger  <cit> . in this reaction, methemoglobin dissociates heme into solvent, which is caught by the mutant apomyoglobin, and the fast and slow phases are the dissociation of heme from the β and α subunits, respectively  <cit> . the time courses of absorbance change in the reactions of methemoglobin with aposhp and apomyoglobin were almost overlaid with similar rate constants. in addition, the rate constants of the two kinetic phases of the methemoglobin/aposhp reaction did not significantly change with . these observations suggest that aposhp does not directly, but indirectly, get heme from methemoglobin. thus, the heme source of shp in vivo is most likely shr.

we have reported the direct heme transfer from shp to htsa  <cit> , the only example of heme transfer from a surface protein to abc transporter. now we have found heme transfer from a cell surface protein to another cell surface protein. these new findings provide opportunity to fully elucidate the molecular mechanism of heme acquisition in s. pyogenes. we propose that shr acquires heme from host proteins and that shp relays heme from shr to htsa. we are currently in process to investigate whether methemoglobin directly transfers its heme to shr and whether shp facilitates heme transfer from shr to htsa. although s. pyogenes shr and shp have homolog only in s. equi  <cit>  among the bacteria with known genome sequences currently, the hemoglobin receptor isdb of s. aureus  <cit>  is a cell surface protein and binds heme  <cit> . s. aureus has additional cell surface heme-binding proteins. it is most likely that s. pyogenes and s. aureus follow similar mechanism of heme transfer, although the proteins involved are not homologous in amino acid sequence. this idea is supported by the similarity in the structures of the shp heme-binding domain and the neat domain of isda and isdc  <cit>  and by the homology between s. pyogenes htsa and s. aureus isde  <cit> . indeed, isda rapidly and directly transfers its heme to isdc in a kinetic mechanism  <cit>  that is similar to that of heme transfer from shp to htsa  <cit> . thus, the detailed biochemical mechanism of heme transfer in the s. pyogenes heme acquisition system may serve as a model for heme acquisition in gram-positive pathogens.

CONCLUSIONS
shr binds heme in a hexacoordinate form and acquires heme from e. coli hemoproteins in vivo. shr efficiently transfers its heme to shp, but not to htsa, under the same conditions, suggesting that shr-to-shp heme transfer is direct. in contrast, shr does not directly acquire heme from human methemoglobin. these results suggest the possibility that shr, but not methemoglobin, is a source of heme for shp in vivo and that the shr-to-shp heme transfer is a step of the heme acquisition process in s. pyogenes.
