BACKGROUND
chlamydia pneumoniae is an obligate intracellular pathogen that infects a wide range of hosts, including mammals, amphibians, and reptiles. the first strain identified was isolated from a child’s conjunctiva during a trachoma vaccine trial in taiwan in the 1960s, and was designated taiwan strain tw <dig>  <cit> . a second strain was isolated from the respiratory tract in  <dig> from the pharynx of a university of washington student with pharyngitis, and designated acute respiratory isolate ar <dig>  together they were referred to as the twar isolates  <cit> . the twar strains, now known as chlamydia  pneumoniae, are associated with atypical pneumonia as well as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis in humans. c. pneumoniae infection is quite common, and serologic studies demonstrate that 80 % of men and 70 % of women show evidence of prior infection by the age of  <dig>  <cit> . while most respiratory-acquired infections are asymptomatic or mild, it can result in pneumonia, usually involving a single lobe, and complications including life-threatening pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome have been reported . in addition, a number of human and animal studies suggest that c. pneumoniae infection can trigger or promote chronic inflammatory conditions, including reactive airway disease and adult-onset asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  <cit> , and atherosclerosis .

like all chlamydia species, c. pneumoniae displays a unique intracellular dimorphic lifestyle that sets it apart from other bacterial species . there are two major developmental forms that are recognized: the infectious, but metabolically inert form, known as the elementary body ; and the replicative form known as the reticulate body . the developmental cycle begins with cellular attachment and entry of the eb, which then rapidly converts to the rb form and begins to replicate by binary fission. these rbs grow and divide within a unique membrane-bound cellular inclusion, and at some point mid to late in the infectious process, rbs asynchronously differentiate back to ebs, and the bacterial forms are eventually released coincident with cell lysis into the extracellular space, around  <dig> to 72 h post infection. then, a new round of infection and development begins with the ebs.

in addition to this productive, lytic lifestyle that releases infectious ebs, chlamydia species have been shown in vitro to enter a persistent state, characterized by the development of large, irregular forms known as aberrant bodies under conditions that include ifn-γ treatment and antibiotic exposure . under these conditions, development stops at this aberrant form and infectious ebs fail to develop. in some cases, growth can resume when the treatment is removed, and the lytic cycle is completed. whether this aberrant growth is relevant in vivo remains of great debate, but it has been hypothesized as a mechanism by which the pathogen could persist and disseminate to distant sites. for example, detection of chlamydial antigens associated with persistence in vitro has been reported in atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting a chronic or persistent infectious state  <cit> .

originally considered a human-specific pathogen, the host range for c. pneumoniae has been expanded to include other mammals such as horses  <cit> , koalas and other marsupials , as well as amphibians and reptiles . genomic studies suggest, in fact, that circulating human isolates originated from a zoonotic source  <cit> . four human c. pneumoniae strains have undergone genomic sequencing: ar <dig>  cwl <dig>  j <dig> and tw <dig>  as noted by mitchell et al., the results reveal remarkable clonality of these isolates, with  <dig>  % conserved gene order and organization, few deletions, and less than  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  <cit> , suggesting that introduction into humans is a relatively recent event in terms of evolution. consequently, there has been little interest in completing genomic sequencing of other c. pneumoniae isolates, and comparative studies of the biological activity of different strains have been limited.

our laboratory has an interest in both the acute respiratory response to c. pneumoniae infection as well as chronic pathogen-induced complications, such as atherosclerosis, and we have utilized both the respiratory strain ar <dig> as well as an atheroma isolate designated ao <dig>  <cit>  for our investigations. we hypothesized that a strain associated with chronic inflammation, such as the atheroma-associated strain ao <dig>  might benefit from inducing a less robust acute inflammatory response to the initial respiratory infection, allowing the bacteria to disseminate and persist more readily. here we report a side-by-side comparison of ao <dig> and ar <dig>  specifically looking at both in vitro and in vivo bacterial growth and host responses, to determine if these two isolates display important biological differences during respiratory infection that could predict the association with chronic complications.

RESULTS
growth of ao <dig> and ar <dig> in l <dig> fibroblasts and macrophages is similar
c. pneumoniae strains ao <dig> and ar <dig> were inoculated into murine l <dig> fibroblasts, and cultured at the standard growth temperature of 35 °c that has been established in the literature  <cit> . at various time points post inoculation, the cells were lysed and the yield of infectious progeny was determined by quantitative culture. to examine the early events in primary infection, we conducted a careful titration over the initial 36 h of infection following inoculation with an identical ifu. as shown in fig. 1a, the recovery of viable organisms rapidly decreased over the first 20 h post infection , consistent with internalization and differentiation of the eb form into the non-cultivatable rb form. by  <dig> hpi, no infectious progeny could be recovered for either strain. the identical titer for both strains over this time period suggests that the early events surrounding attachment, invasion, and differentiation are similar. after 24 h, we found the recovery of organisms to again be nearly identical. as shown in fig. 1b, the titer of recovered ebs for ao <dig> and ar <dig> was identical at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, with both strains demonstrating a significant amplification of the inoculum by more than  <dig> logs .fig.  <dig> comparative growth of c. pneumoniae strains ao <dig> and ar <dig>  a-c recovered ao <dig> and ar <dig> from infected l <dig> cells  or bmdm . cells were incubated at 35 °c and quantitative culture was carried out at the indicated time points, as described in the methods. d, e quantitative culture of ao <dig> and ar <dig> infected l <dig>  or bmdm  grown at 35 °c vs. 37 °c growth temperature. cells were harvested at  <dig> hpi for l <dig> and  <dig> hpi for bmdm, and quantitative culture was carried out as described in the methods. for panels a, b and d, the inoculum was 4x <dig> ifu . for panels c and e, the inoculum was 2x <dig> . significance: *, p ≤  <dig> ; ***, p ≤  <dig> ; compared the recovered bacteria number of ao <dig> with ar <dig> in the same time point. data is representative of 2- <dig> independent experiments



c. pneumoniae is one of the chlamydia spp. that can productively infect macrophages. we next asked if growth in macrophages differed between the two strains by conducting quantitative culture in murine bone marrow derived macrophages . cells were infected with ao <dig> or ar <dig>  and lysates were harvested and quantified again at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hpi. in this case, we recovered ar <dig> but not ao <dig> at the earlier time point of  <dig> hpi , suggesting that the differentiation from rb phase back to the eb phase might be delayed in ao <dig> relative to ar <dig> within macrophages. however, both strains released infectious ebs at the later time point of  <dig> hpi, with the yield being higher for ar <dig> compared to ao <dig> in a small but statistically significant fashion. titration beyond  <dig> hpi was not pursued as it would be confounded by a second round of infection. of note, the yield from bmdm was largely unchanged from the original inoculum , demonstrating the inefficiency of replication for both strains in macrophages.

while c. pneumoniae is commonly cultivated at 35 °c in vitro, the preferred temperature for growth of the mammalian host cells is 37 °c. we next asked if altering the growth temperature for ao <dig> and ar <dig> would differentially impact the yield of infectious ebs. growth in both l <dig> fibroblasts and macrophages was repeated, this time comparing the yield when infected cells were cultured at 35 °c vs. 37 °c. for simplicity, the midpoint of log-phase growth at 35 °c, or  <dig> hpi, was chosen to generate comparative data in the l <dig> fibroblasts. overall, the yield at 37 °c was reduced compared to bacteria grown at 35 °c in the l <dig> fibroblasts , and while there was a trend towards a higher yield for ar <dig> compared to ao <dig> at 37 °c, it did not reach statistical significance. comparative growth in macrophages under the two temperatures was determined at the later time point of  <dig> hpi given the delayed development in this cell type. surprisingly, we observed a difference between the two strains depending on the temperature of the cultured cells . the quantity of ebs recovered was slightly greater for ar <dig> compared to ao <dig> when cells were cultured at 35 °c; however, at 37 °c, the yield was greater for ao <dig>  while the biological significance of such small differences is unclear, it does suggest that ao <dig> is more tolerant of growth at a higher temperature compared to ar <dig>  thus, at the host temperature of 37 °c, ao <dig> might have a growth advantage over ar <dig> in macrophage-like cells.

both ao <dig> and ar <dig> form plaques in vitro
to further assess the infectivity of the two strains, we examined the comparative plaquing efficiency of ao <dig> vs. ar <dig>  to our knowledge, there have been no previous published reports on the ability of c. pneumoniae to form plaques in vitro. in fact, gieffers and colleagues utilized a focus-forming assay to identify clonal variants of c. pneumoniae as the species would not form plaques using mccoy cells  <cit> . we first compared a number of cell lines to see if we could enhance plaquing efficiency for c. pneumoniae by varying the host cell, testing hela, hep- <dig>  l <dig>  hl and mccoy cells. we found that c. pneumoniae was capable of forming plaques within l <dig> fibroblasts , thus this cell line was used for the subsequent plaque assays described below.

to determine the efficiency of c. pneumoniae to form plaques, strains ao <dig> and ar <dig> were titrated in parallel using the modified plaque assay described in the methods section. as shown in fig.  <dig>  we observed the formation of small plaques with both ao <dig> and ar <dig> after 15 days, in a dose-dependent manner, albeit with low efficiency. the efficiency of plating  was determined to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for ao <dig> vs.  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for an inoculum of  <dig> ifu per well . in addition to the reduced efficiency of forming plaques, the plaque size for both ao <dig> and ar <dig> inoculated monolayers was also small , with a diameter measuring  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm for ao <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm for ar <dig> . neither the efficiency of forming plaques nor the plaque size differed in a statistically significant manner between ao <dig> and ar <dig>  suggesting that both strains replicate and form inclusions equally well. thus, c. pneumoniae is capable of forming small plaques with reduced efficiency compared to what has been published with other species of chlamydia, and we did not detect significant differences between the two strains that we tested.fig.  <dig> comparison of plaques formed by c. pneumoniae strains ao <dig> and ar <dig>  shown are representative images of individual plaques formed following infection of l <dig> fibroblasts with the indicated inoculum, using the plaque assay described in the methods section. plaque sizes were determined to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm for ao <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm for ar <dig> . data is representative of  <dig> independent experiments



inflammatory cytokine response to ao <dig> and ar <dig> infection differs in vitro
the subtle differences in bacterial growth that we observed between the two strains in bmdm suggested that the host response to the intracellular organisms might also differ. to test this, we inoculated bmdm with ao <dig> or ar <dig> at varying mois, and allowed the infection to proceed at either 35 °c  or 37 °c . to avoid the confounding issue of cytokine feedback, supernatants were harvested at  <dig> hpi, and assayed for inflammatory cytokines. it should be noted that this time point is too early to identify intracellular inclusions in macrophages by routine microscopy for c. pneumoniae which has a much longer developmental cycle than other chlamydia species. however, the titer for all stocks was confirmed as detailed in the methods section, thus ensuring an accurate inoculum.

we observed no difference between the two strains in terms of their ability to induce cytokine secretion for most of the mediators tested within this time frame, regardless of the incubation temperature. for example, there was no statistically significant difference between the two strains in terms of their ability to induce secretion of il-1β . secretion of il- <dig> and tnf-α induced by ao <dig> and ar <dig> infection was also the same , while il- <dig> secretion was higher for ar <dig> but only for one moi and only at 35 °c . interestingly, although c. pneumoniae is known to be a weak inducer of type i ifns  <cit> , we found that ar <dig> induced significantly higher ifn-β than ao <dig> at both temperatures tested . thus, ar <dig> appears to be more inflammatory than ao <dig> for a subset of cytokines, and in particular for the type i ifns.fig.  <dig> cytokine induction in bmdm infected with c. pneumoniae strains ao <dig> or ar <dig>  bmdms were prepared as described in the methods. the cells were infected with ao <dig> or ar <dig> at the indicated moi, and incubated at 35 °c or 37 °c. supernatant was harvested at 24 h post infection and assayed for  il-1β,  il- <dig> and  ifn-β. graphs depict the mean ± sem, and are representative of  <dig> independent experiments



ar <dig> induces more severe acute pulmonary disease compared to ao <dig> in vivo
the growth and development of an obligate intracellular pathogen like c. pneumoniae is tightly linked to the host cell. given the differences in bacterial growth depending on the host cell type and culture temperature, combined with the trend for induction of more proinflammatory cytokines by ar <dig> in vitro, we asked whether the two strains might differ in terms of the host response to infection in vivo. to test this, c57bl/ <dig> mice were infected intranasally with ao <dig> or ar <dig>  or mock infected with pbs alone, and then monitored for both the clinical and pathological response over time, evaluating the mice at time points likely to reflect the acute , mid  and recovery  phases of infection  <cit> . the overall effect of condition on the clinical finding of weight loss was found to be statistically significant on days  <dig> through  <dig>  and the effect was borderline  on days  <dig> and  <dig>  compared to mock infected mice, both groups of c. pneumoniae-infected mice lost a significant amount of weight after inoculation . for ar <dig> infected mice, this was statistically significant on days 2- <dig>  while for ao <dig> mice it was significant on days 2- <dig>  the greatest weight loss occurred over the first 4- <dig> days, after which time both groups of c. pneumoniae infected mice gradually regained the lost weight and there was no difference between the three groups after day  <dig>  pairwise analysis between ao <dig> vs. ar <dig> infected mice revealed a statistically significant difference on days 6- <dig>  all within the period of time when the overall f-test was significant. thus, the ar <dig> infected mice had more severe weight loss in response to infection compared to the ao <dig> infected mice.fig.  <dig> kinetics of weight loss in mice infected with c. pneumoniae strains ao <dig> or ar <dig>  c57bl/ <dig> mice were intranasally infected with c. pneumoniae strain ao <dig> or ar <dig>  or mock infected, as described in the methods. after infection, mice were monitored and weighed daily. at predetermined time points, a subset of the mice were euthanized for analysis of histopathological changes and bacterial culture. percent body weight was calculated compared to body weight at the time of inoculation, and is graphed on the y-axis. the number mice per group are indicated in parentheses below the x-axis. statistical analysis was carried out as described in the methods section. significance: p <  <dig>  for overall effect of condition on days 2- <dig> and borderline  on days  <dig> and  <dig>  as determined by anova f-test . within this significant f-test period, p <  <dig>  days 6- <dig> and borderline  on day  <dig> for ao <dig> vs. ar <dig>  data is representative of  <dig> independent experiments



when we looked at the local inflammatory response in the lungs, ar <dig> infected mice displayed significantly more inflammation in the lungs, as determined by h&e staining, compared to ao <dig> infected mice . at day  <dig>  the areas of inflammation were more extensive in the ar <dig> infected mice compared to the ao <dig> infected mice, with little normal appearing lung tissue visible. at day  <dig>  while the inflammation in the ao <dig> infected mice had completely resolved, patchy inflammation was still apparent in the ar <dig> infected mice. these differences were quantifiable and statistically significant . thus, mice infected with the respiratory isolate, ar <dig>  developed more severe acute lung disease than mice infected with the atheroma isolate ao <dig> fig.  <dig> histopathological changes in the lungs of mice infected with c. pneumoniae strains ao <dig> or ar <dig>  c57bl/ <dig> mice were intranasally infected with c. pneumoniae strain ao <dig> or ar <dig>  or mock infected; at designated time points , mice were euthanized and the lungs were processed, as described in the methods section. a-f representative images of h&e stained lung tissue from 1 μm resin-embedded sections; n =  <dig> mice per group. arrow heads identify areas of inflammation while the arrows identify normal lung. g quantified inflammation area from lung sections was generated using image-j software analyzing both lungs, n =  <dig> mice per group. significance: *, p ≤  <dig> . data is representative of  <dig> independent experiments



consistent with the apparent histological differences in inflammation, ar <dig> infected mice also had higher levels of a number of cytokines in the lung tissue at day  <dig>  including il- <dig>  tnf-α, il-1β and il-10; the irf-regulated cytokines ip- <dig> and ifn-β were also higher in the lungs of ar <dig> infected mice . by day  <dig>  however, similar to the improvement in weight loss and lung inflammation, cytokine levels returned to normal in both groups of infected mice.fig.  <dig> cytokine induction in the lungs of ao <dig> or ar <dig> infected mice. group mice were infected with ao <dig> or ar <dig>  or mock infected, and euthanized at designated time points as described in figure four and the methods section. removed lung were homogenized and the lung homogenates were assayed for cytokines il- <dig> , tnf-α , il-1β , il- <dig> , ip- <dig>  and ifn-β  by elisa. each data point represents one mouse. horizontal bar represents the mean. significance: ns, not significant; *, p ≤  <dig> ; **, p ≤  <dig> ; ***, p ≤  <dig> . data is representative of  <dig> independent experiments



finally, recovery of bacteria from lung tissue was also higher for ar <dig> at day  <dig> compared to ao <dig>  and even out to day  <dig> there were still mice from which we could recover ar <dig> from lung tissue . however, we found no significant difference in the ability of the bacteria to disseminate to the spleen . while there was a trend for more frequent recovery of bacteria at this distant site in the ar <dig> infected group, it did not reach statistical significance, likely reflecting the overall low frequency of dissemination of live  bacteria in both groups.fig.  <dig> bacterial load in the lungs of ao <dig> or ar <dig> infected mice. lung homogenates from ao <dig> or ar <dig> infected mice were performed c. pneumoniae quantitative culture as described in the methods. each data point represents one mouse and the horizontal bar represents the mean. significance: ns, no significant difference; ***, p ≤  <dig> . data is representative of  <dig> independent experiments

discussion
this is the first comparison of the growth dynamics of c. pneumoniae strains ao <dig> and ar <dig> in vitro and in vivo, and the first demonstration that strain differences can impact the host response to infection using a mouse model. both ao <dig> and ar <dig> displayed nearly identical growth patterns in vitro, and both strains were capable of forming plaques under our culture conditions. this latter observation is relevant to the chlamydia field as previously published data suggested that c. pneumoniae could not be cloned using the traditional plaque assay. however, subtle differences between the strains in terms of growth and development were observed depending on the cell type and growth temperature. both strains grew better when cultured at 35 °c compared to 37 °c, but only in l <dig> fibroblasts. while both strains could infect macrophages, ar <dig> had the growth advantage at 35 °c while ao <dig> had the growth advantage at 37 °c, at least in vitro. the explanation for why ao <dig> has the growth advantage at 37 °c is unclear. data from bonanomi suggests that at 37 °c, ar <dig> has a longer lag phase than ao <dig>  although comparisons were not made to growth at 35 °c in that study  <cit> . while ao <dig> had a slight growth advantage at 37 °c in vitro in our hands, the fact that we recovered more ar <dig> than ao <dig> in the lungs of infected mice would suggest that in vivo infectivity, growth and development might not necessary parallel what is observed in vitro.

in addition to differences in bacterial growth and development, we also observed important differences in terms of the host response to the two different strains. the induction of type i ifns, and to a lesser extent il- <dig>  from infected bmdm in vitro was greater in ar <dig> infected cells compared to ao <dig>  this occurred in spite of the fact that we observed a greater yield of ao <dig> from bmdm cultured at 37 °c compared to cells infected with an identical inoculum of ar <dig>  thus, we cannot explain this difference in cytokine induction simply from a larger bacterial burden. the more compelling data, however, demonstrates that mice experienced more severe weight loss and more severe lung inflammation when infected via the intranasal route with ar <dig> compared to ao <dig>  this is consistent with our recently published data correlating the induction of type i ifns in vitro with disease severity in vivo, using ar <dig> in two mouse strains  <cit> . in this study, we observed that impaired bacterial growth predicted impaired host tolerance of infection in vitro and in vivo through the activation of type i ifn signaling pathways. thus, the growth differences of ar <dig> and ao <dig> in macrophages at 37 °c could similarly lead to their varying ability to activate the type i ifn signaling pathways, and the subsequent differences in the host response. taken together, these data demonstrate that the type i ifn response is a key factor in determining the ability of the host to tolerate c. pneumoniae infection, and it can be regulated by either host or pathogen characteristics.

at this time, we can only speculate as to the basis for the differences in bacterial growth and the host response to infection that we observed. there was no apparent difference in infectivity or growth in vitro between these two strains, and both were capable of forming plaques in cell culture. while we do not have the genome sequence for ao <dig> to compare with the published sequence of ar <dig>  as noted earlier, there is remarkable clonality between all the sequenced isolates of c. pneumoniae, with  <dig>  % conserved gene order and organization, and few deletions and polymorphisms  <cit> . however, small differences at the level of the genome could lead to significant differences in gene regulation that might account for the differences in growth, the timing of expression of specific pathogen-associated inflammatory ligands, and eventually the differences in the host response. molestina et al. reported that the omp <dig> gene from ao <dig> displays  <dig> nucleotide changes resulting in nonsynonymous codons compared to the respiratory strains tw <dig> and ar <dig>  <cit> . like us, they also observed that ao <dig> displayed the lowest stimulatory activity in terms of upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules in human endothelial cells compared to the respiratory strains ar <dig> and tw <dig>  this latter point is reassuring as it suggests that our observation is more likely to be driven by the specific strain types rather than phenotypic drift of clinical isolates passaged in vitro.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our data suggests that, despite the limited genetic variability among c. pneumoniae strains, phenotypic differences exist between human isolates that lead to differences in inflammatory potential. the result is variability between strains in terms of the clinical course of pneumonia, and potentially could impact associated diseases, such as atherosclerosis and asthma. the basis for the differences that we observed between these two clinical strains is not clear at this time, and would require more extensive genetic and transcriptional profiling that is beyond the scope of this report. in the context of our previous study  <cit> , our data is consistent with an important role for activation of type i ifns in driving many aspects of c. pneumoniae virulence, and demonstrates that both host and pathogen factors can contribute to outcome. the ability to identify specific bacterial traits that can predict the development of complications would greatly benefit the field.
