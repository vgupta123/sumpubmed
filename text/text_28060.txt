BACKGROUND
epidermal growth factor  receptor substrate  <dig> , a member of the eps8-family proteins, is originally identified as a substrate for the egf receptor tyrosine kinase  <cit> . it contains a putative n-terminal phosphotyrosine binding protein  domain, a central src homology  <dig>  domain and a c-terminal effector domain, each being a potential site for protein-protein interaction  <cit> . previous structural and functional studies have revealed that eps <dig>  via its sh <dig> domain, participates in forming distinct protein complexes that either transduce signals from ras to rac leading to actin remodeling or regulate endocytosis of receptor tyrosine kinases  <cit> . in addition, it may regulate actin dynamics through its ability to activate rac by forming an active complex with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor sos- <dig>  the adaptor abi- <dig>  and the p <dig> regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase  <cit> , the stability of which is increased by association with insulin receptor substrate p <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, eps <dig> also directly controls actin cytoskeleton dynamics and architecture via its actin barbed-end capping and actin bundling activities, which resides in its c-terminal effector domain  <cit> . while the molecular characteristics of eps <dig> have been elucidated over the past few years, most functional studies of this protein were performed in fibroblasts or cancer cell lines. the significance of eps <dig> in neurons; however, has only just begun to be elucidated.

regarding the expression of eps <dig> in the brain, it has been shown that eps <dig> is specifically localized to the somatodendritic and axonal compartments of granule cells and unipolar brush cells in the rat cerebellum  <cit> . furthermore, eps <dig> is expressed in both synaptosomal and postsynaptic density fractions and is tightly associated with postsynaptic density  proteins, psd- <dig>  chapsyn 110/psd- <dig> and n-methyl-d-aspartate  receptor subunit nr <dig>  in cerebellar granule cells  <cit> . interestingly, recent studies show that eps <dig> contributes to the formation of dendritic spines and activity-mediated synaptic plasticity in cultured hippocampal neuron model  <cit>  and eps8-null mice exhibits a defect in spine formation and learning-dependent spinogenesis in the hippocampus  <cit> . furthermore, eps <dig> has also been shown to regulate axonal filopodia formation in cultured hippocampal neurons in response to brain-derived neurotrophic factor  <cit> . these results strongly suggest an important role for eps <dig> in the regulation of hippocampal neuronal structure and function. however, there is scarce information about the endogenous expression pattern and cellular distribution of eps <dig> in the hippocampus. here, we analyze the expression pattern of endogenous eps <dig> protein in the mouse hippocampus using fluorescence immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. our data suggest that eps <dig> protein in the hippocampus is predominantly expressed in calbindin- and cholecystokinin-expressing gabaergic interneurons in area ca <dig> stratum radiatum and the border of lacunosum-moleculare.

RESULTS
immunolocalization of endogenous eps <dig> in area ca <dig> of the mouse hippocampus
to verify the specificity of the eps <dig> antibody, western blot analysis of hippocampal and cerebellar tissue lysates was conducted. the eps <dig> antibody specifically detected a band at ~97 kda, consistent with the molecular weight of eps <dig> protein . to identify the eps8-expressing cells in the hippocampus, we first performed immunohistochemical staining with anti-eps <dig> antibody in hippocampal sections. to our surprise, eps <dig> immunoreactivity was rarely found in pyramidal cell layer lying in area ca <dig>  but appeared moderate in the cell bodies and dendrites of cells located in the stratum radiatum and at the border of stratum radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare . we also performed control experiments where the primary antibody was preadsorbed with the blocking peptide  or omitted . control experiments showed no immunostaining, further confirming the specificity of the eps <dig> antibody.

double immunofluorescent staining with the mature neuronal marker neun revealed that nearly all of the eps8-expressing cells were positive for neuronal nuclear antigen . in contrast, we did not detect eps <dig> immunoreactivity in glial cells, which were identified by antibody directed against the glial marker glial fibrillary acidic protein  and showed typical star-shaped astrocyte morphology , indicating that eps <dig> expression is essentially confined to neurons.

specific subpopulations of hippocampal interneurons expressing eps8
given that glial cells do not express eps <dig>  the morphology and localization of the intense eps <dig> immunoreactivity in the stratum radiatum and the border of lacunosum-moleculare imply that those eps8-expressing cells are most likely interneurons. we therefore set out to characterize eps8-expressing cells in hippocampal area ca <dig> of 67 kda isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase-green fluorescence protein  knock-in mice, in which gabaergic interneurons are specifically labeled with gfp fluorescence. in agreement with the previous report  <cit> , gfp-expressing interneurons were present in all layers of hippocampal area ca <dig> and displayed immunoreactivity for gaba  or neun , confirming their identity as gabaergic interneurons. as expected, the majority of eps8-expressing cells were gfp-expressing interneurons . the proportion of gfp-expressing interneurons coexpressing eps <dig> was highest in the stratum radiatum  and less in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare, stratum oriens and stratum pyramidale .

to further assess the eps8-expressing interneuron subpopulation, co-staining of eps <dig> with subpopulation-specific interneuronal markers was conducted. we performed immunofluorescent staining for calbindin, parvalbumin and calretinin in hippocampal sections. double-labeling for eps <dig> and calbindin revealed that all eps8-expressing cells were positive for calbindin . however, no eps8-expressing cells were found that expressed parvalbumin  or calretinin .

we next examined in more detail the molecular profile of eps8-expressing cells in hippocampal area ca <dig>  the vast majority of eps8-expressing cells were positive for cholecystokinin . we did not observe colocalization of eps <dig> protein with somatostatin .

finally, interneurons immunopositive for each maker were quantified according to their soma location within hippocampal ca <dig> layers and then the propotion of interneurons in each layer, which colocalized with eps <dig> was assessed . the proportion of calbindin-expressing interneurons coexpressing eps <dig> was in highest in the stratum radiatum , less in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare and stratum oriens , and null in stratum pyramidale. likewise, the majority of cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons coexpressing eps <dig> were located in the stratum radiatum  and stratum lacunosum-moleculare , and only 4% of these interneurons located in the stratum oriens.

discussion
there is emerging evidence that eps <dig> is involved in the regulation of activity-mediated spine formation, possibly through its actin barbed-end capping and bundling activities  <cit> . mice lacking eps <dig> display abnormal growth of immature spines and cognitive impairment  <cit> . our findings provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration for a cell type-specific expression pattern of endogenous eps <dig> protein in the mouse hippocampus. our data indicate that in area ca <dig> eps <dig> protein is predominantly expressed in calbindin- and cholecystokinin-expressing gabaergic interneurons in the stratum radiatum and the border of lacunosum-moleculare. we further show that eps <dig> expression is rare in ca <dig> pyramidal cell somata, and glial cells do not express eps <dig> 

literature regarding the role of eps <dig> in the formation of dendritic spines and axonal filopodia comes mainly from the hippocampal neuronal culture system in overexpression condition  <cit> . it has been shown that eps <dig> expressed in both the cell bodies and neurites, and prominently enriched in the dendritic spine heads and axonal growth cones of cultured hippocampal pyramidal neurons  <cit> . with the same anti-eps <dig> antibody as was used in the current study, a previous study has demonstrated the expression of eps <dig> protein in scattered cells of ca <dig>  ca <dig> and dentate gyrus of the mouse hippocampus  <cit> ; however, they did not identify which types of cells express eps <dig> protein. in this study, we have extended these findings by showing that eps <dig> is restrictedly present in some subpopulations of hippocampal neurons, but not in glial cells. it is worth noting that only few eps8-expressing cell bodies were found in ca <dig> stratum pyramidale of the mouse hippocampus. most eps8-expressing cells located in the stratum pyramidale also contain gad <dig>  indicating that they belong to gabaergic interneuron classes. furthermore, it is unlikely that the weakness of eps <dig> immunoreactivity observed in ca <dig> pyramidal cells results from insufficient detection sensitivity of eps <dig> antibody used in the current study. this view is supported by  under our staining condition, we successfully detected abundant expression of eps <dig> protein in specific ca <dig> interneuron subpopulations, and  strong immunoreactivity to eps <dig> antibody was detected in mouse cerebellar neurons , which are known to constitutively express high levels of eps <dig>  <cit> . these observations would then be logical to assume that endogenous regulation of neuronal morphogenesis and structural plasticity by eps <dig> in the hippocampus might be more significant in interneurons than in pyramidal cells.

with respect to the subcellular localization, eps <dig> protein has been reported to be expressed both presynaptically in the molecular layer and postsynaptically in the glomeruli of the granule cell layer in adult mouse cerebellum  <cit> . although we did not explore this issue in detail in this study, our immunolocalization data indicate that eps <dig> protein is expressed in both soma and dendrites of a subset of gabaergic interneurons in area ca <dig> of the mouse hippocampus. further studies are required to examine its subcellular localization patterns with specific biomarker staining for subcellular compartments.

using gad67-gfp knock-in mice and immunofluorescent double-labeling, we confirmed that some subpopulations of gabaergic interneurons in hippocampal area ca <dig> express high levels of eps <dig>  eps8-expressing interneurons were present in all layers of area ca <dig> with the higher density in the stratum radiatum and at the border of stratum radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare. with respect to the calcium-binding proteins and peptides that characterize different subpopulations of gabaergic interneurons  <cit> , we found substantial co-expression of eps <dig> and calbindin, but not parvalbumin or calretinin. we also found that eps <dig> is present in a subset of cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons. taken these findings into consideration, our results suggest that eps8-expressing cells in hippocampal area ca <dig> predominantly belong to the calbindin- and cholecystokinin-expressing subpopulations of gabaergic interneurons. in addition to using molecular expression profiles, gabaergic interneurons can be distinguished on the basis of their morphology, electrophysiological features, and innervations of distinct subcellular domains of pyramidal cells  <cit> . so far, more than  <dig> different types of interneurons have been recognized in the hippocampus and neocortex  <cit> . it has been reported previously that ca <dig> pyramidal cells are supported by at least  <dig> distinct types of gabaergic interneurons, each having highly stereotypic laminar arrangements and functions  <cit> . considering the pattern of co-staining and distribution, we speculate that eps8-expressing cells belong to a s of schaffer collateral-associated interneurons, which preferentially innervate pyramidal cell apical dendrites in conjunction with the schaffer collateral-commissural input pathways  <cit> . functionally, schaffer collateral-associated interneurons have a regular accommodating firing pattern and provide a feedforward inhibition onto ca <dig> pyramidal cells  <cit> . these findings raise the intriguing possibility that eps8-expressing gabaergic interneurons may act in concert with other classes of gabaergic interneurons to innervate distinct domains of pyramidal cells, thereby controlling and orchestrating hippocampal network activities.

what could be the function of eps <dig> expression in gabaergic interneurons? given its ability to regulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> , it seems reasonable to speculate that eps <dig> may play some role in maintaining gabaergic interneuron morphogenesis. another possible role for eps <dig> is in coordinating dynamic processes of membrane receptor trafficking  <cit> . indeed, a mechanistic role for eps <dig> in mediating clathrin-mediated endocytosis of egf receptors and fibroblast growth factor receptors has been reported in hela cells  <cit> . since constitutive and regulated trafficking of membrane receptors to and from the plasma membrane are important processes for the maintenance of neuronal function and responsiveness to external stimuli, the specific expression of eps <dig> in gabaergic interneurons may be critical for maintaining the homeostatic levels of membrane receptors. additional cell type-specific control of cre-mediated eps <dig> conditional knockout studies are needed to examine these possibilities.

CONCLUSIONS
our study identifies novel expression of eps <dig> protein in specific interneuron subpopulations in the mouse hippocampus, in addition to its known expression in the dendritic spine heads and axonal growth cones of glutamatergic pyramidal cells. further work is needed for the detailed molecular and electrophysiological analyses to measure the functional significance of newly characterized eps8-expressing cells in the hippocampus.
