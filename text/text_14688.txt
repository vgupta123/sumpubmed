BACKGROUND
althought boron  is a micronutrient element required for normal growth and development of higher plants, it is harmful to plants when present in excess. whilst of lesser importance than b-deficiency , b-toxicity is also an important problem in agricultural regions across the world, which citrus trees are cultivated  <cit> . despite the importance of b-toxicity for crop productivity, the mechanisms by which plants respond to b-toxicity are poorly understood yet. recently, increasing attention has been paid to plant b-toxicity as a result of the increased demand for desalinated water, in which the b level may be too high for healthy irrigation of crops  <cit> .

alteration of gene expression levels is an inevitable process of plants responding to environmental stresses. kasajima and fujiwara first investigated high b-induced changes in gene expression in arabidopsis thaliana roots and rosette leaves using microarray, and identified a number of high b-induced genes, including a heat shock protein and a number of the multi-drug and toxic compound extrusion  family transporters  <cit> . hassan et al. preformed suppression subtractive hybridization on root cdna from bulked b-tolerant and -intolerant doubled haploid barley lines grown under moderate b-stress and identified  <dig> upregulated clones in the tolerant bulk under b-stress, nine of which were genetically mapped to b-tolerant quantitative trait loci. an antioxidative response mechanism was suggested to provide an advantage in tolerating high level of soil b  <cit> . recently, aquea et al. found that b-toxicity upregulated the expression of genes related to aba signaling, aba response and cell wall modification, and downregulated the expression of genes involved in water transporters in arabidopsis roots, concluding that root growth inhibition was caused by b-toxicity-induced water-stress  <cit> . most research, however, has focused on roots and herbaceous plants , very little is known about the differential expression of genes in response to b-toxicity in leaves and woody plants.

citrus belongs to evergreen subtropical fruit trees. in china, b-toxicity often occurs in citrus orchards from high level of b in soils and/or irrigation water and from inappropriate application of b fertilizer especially under low-rainfall conditions  <cit> . during 1998– <dig>  huang et al. investigated the nutrient status of soils and leaves from  <dig> ‘guanximiyou’ pummelo  orchards located in pinghe, zhangzhou, china. up to  <dig> % and  <dig> % of orchards were excess in leaf b and soil water-soluble b, respectively  <cit> . previous studies showed that b-toxicity disturbed citrus plant growth and metabolism in multiple way, including interference of nutrient uptake  <cit> , ultrastructural damage of roots and leaves  <cit> , inhibition of co <dig> assimilation, photosynthetic enzymes and photosynthetic electron transport, decrease of chlorophyll , carotenoid  and total soluble protein levels, affecting leaf carbohydrate metabolism and antioxidant system  <cit> . however, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes in citrus is very limited. to our best knowledge, no high b-toxicity-induced changes in gene expression profiles have been reported in citrus plants to date. here we investigated the effects of b-toxicity on growth, leaf co <dig> assimilation, leaf concentrations of malondialdehyde , pigments and total soluble protein, root and leaf concentration of b, leaf concentration of phosphorus , and leaf gene expression profiles using cdna-amplified fragment length polymorphism  in citrus grandis and citrus sinensis seedlings differing in b-tolerance  <cit> . the aims of this study were to elucidate the adaptive mechanisms of citrus plants to b-toxicity and to identify b-tolerant genes.

RESULTS
effects of b-toxicity on seedlings growth, b concentration in roots and leaves, and p concentration in leaves
because b is phloem immobile in citrus plants, b-toxic symptoms first developed in old leaves. the typical visible symptom produced in b-toxic leaves was leaf burn , which only occurred in c. grandis plants. in the later stages, b-toxic leaves shed premature. by contrast, almost no visible symptoms occurred in c. sinensis plants except for very few plants .

b-toxicity-induced decreases in root, shoot and whole plant dry weights  were more pronounced in c. grandis than in c. sinensis seedlings . root dw decreased to a larger extent than shoot dw in response to b-toxicity, and resulted in a decrease in root dw/shoot dw ratio of both c. grandis and c. sinensis seedlings .figure  <dig>

b-toxicity increased b concentration in roots and leaves, especially in leaves and decreased p concentration in c. grandis leaves. no significant differences were found in root and leaf b concentration and leaf p concentration between the two species at each given b treatment except that b concentration was higher in b-toxic c. sinensis leaves than in b-toxic c. grandis ones .figure  <dig>

b-toxicity decreased concentrations of chl a + b and car and ratio of chl a/b in c. grandis and c. sinensis leaves. in control leaves, all the three parameters did not differ between the two species, but chl a + b and car concentrations were higher in b-toxic c. sinensis leaves than in b-toxic c. grandis ones .

leaf concentrations of total soluble protein and mda were decreased and increased by b-toxicity in c. grandis leaves, respectively, but were not significantly affected in c. sinensis ones .

here we used a total of  <dig> selective primer combinations to isolate the differentially expressed transcript-derived fragments  from b-toxic leaves of two citrus species differing in b-tolerance. a representative picture of a silver-stained cdna-aflp gel showing b-toxicity-induced genes in c. grandis and c. sinensis leaves was presented in additional file  <dig>  as shown in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig> clear and unambiguous tdfs were detected from the b-toxic leaves, with an average of  <dig>   tdfs for each primer combination. among these tdfs,  <dig> tdfs only presented in c. grandis,  <dig> tdfs only presented in c. sinensis, and  <dig> tdfs presented in the two species.table  <dig>

a total of  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed and reproducible tdfs were successfully obtained from b-toxic c. grandis and c. sinensis leaves, respectively. all these tdfs were re-amplified, cloned and sequenced. for c. grandis,  <dig> of fragments yielded usable sequence data. aligment analysis showed  <dig> tdfs were homologous to genes encoding known, putative predicted, uncharacterized, hypothetical or unnamed proteins, and the remaining  <dig> tdfs showed no significant matches . among these matched tdfs,  <dig>  tdfs were up-regulated and  <dig>  were down-regulated by b-toxicity. these tdfs were related to different biological processes such as cell transport , lipid metabolism , nucleic acid metabolism , carbohydrate and energy metabolism , protein and amino acid metabolism , stress responses , cell wall and cytoskeleton modification , signal transduction , other and unknown processes  . for c. sinensis leaves,  <dig> differentially expressed tdfs produced readable sequences ,  <dig> of which displayed homology to genes encoding known, putative, hypothetical, uncharacterized or unnamed proteins. the remaining  <dig> tdfs had no database matches. of these matched tdfs,  <dig>  tdfs increased and  <dig>  decreased in response to b-toxicity. these tdfs were involved in cell transport , lipid metabolism , nucleic acid metabolism , carbohydrate and energy metabolism , protein and amino acid metabolism , stress responses , cell wall and cytoskeleton modification , signal transduction , other and unknown processes  .table  <dig>

validation of cdna-aflp data using qrt-pcr
in this study, nine tdfs from c. sinensis leaves and nine tdfs from c. grandis ones were selected for qrt-pcr analysis in order to validate their expression patterns obtained by cdna-aflp analysis. except for two tdfs , the expression profiles of all the tdfs obtained by qrt-pcr were in agreement with the expression patterns produced by cdna-aflp . this technique was thus validated in  <dig> % of cases. in addition to gene family complexity, the changes in the intensity of individual bands in the cdna-aflp gels might be responsible for the discrepancies between qrt-pcr and cdna-aflp analysis.figure  <dig>

discussion
c. sinensis displayed higher b-tolerance than c. grandis
our results showed that the effects of b-toxicity on plant growth , and leaf gas exchange, pigments, total soluble protein, mda  and p  were more pronounced in c. grandis than in c. sinensis seedlings, meaning that c. sinensis has higher b-tolerance than c. grandis. the present work, like that of the previous workers  <cit> , indicates that the major of b in b-toxic citrus plants was accumulated in the leaves . as shown in figure 2b, b concentration was not lower in c. sinensis than in c. grandis leaves regardless of b concentration in the nutrient solution, indicating that c. sinensis leaves may tolerate higher level of b. similar result has been obtained by huang et al.  <cit> . here we isolated  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated tdfs from b-toxic c. grandis leaves, whilst only  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated tdfs from b-toxic c. sinensis ones , suggesting that b-toxicity affects c. sinensis leaves gene expression less than c. grandis ones. these data also support above inference that c. sinensis leaves may tolerate higher level of b.

we found that co <dig> assimilation was lower in toxic leaves than in control leaves, while stomatal conductance was not lower in the former , implies that b-toxicity-induced inhibition of co <dig> assimilation in two citrus species is primarily due to non-stomatal factors. similar results have been obtained on b-toxic c. grandis and c. sinensis  <cit> , ‘navelina’ orange and ‘clementine’ mandarin plants grafted on sour orange and swingle citrumelo rootstocks  <cit> , newhall and skagg’s bonanza navel orange plants grafted on carrizo citrange and trifoliate orange  <cit> .

leaf carbohydrate and energy metabolism
since b-toxicity decreased co <dig> assimilation , genes involved in photosynthesis and related biological processes might be affected by b-toxicity. as expected,  <dig> tdfs in c. grandis leaves and  <dig> tdfs in c. sinensis ones related to carbohydrate and energy metabolism were altered under b-toxicity . we found that b-toxicity decreased the transcript level of ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate  carboxylase/oxygenase  small subunit precursor  gene in c. grandis leaves , which agrees with the previous report that b-toxicity decreased the activity of rubisco in c. grandis leaves  <cit> . hudson et al. showed that the reduction of rubisco concentration by anti-small subunit led to decreased photosynthesis in transgenic tobacco plants, but unchanged stomatal conductance  <cit> . also, the mrna abundances of photosystem ii  32 kda protein , chloroplast psii oxygen-evolving complex 23 kda polypeptide  and nifu-like protein  genes were down-regulated in b-toxic c. grandis leaves . khan et al. reported that psba knockout tobacco plants lacked psii activity, accompanied by promoted senescence  <cit> . by using differential rna interference , ishihara et al. demonstrated that psii activity was linearly correlated with the total amount of psbp   <cit> . ifuku et al. reported that psbp is essential for the regulation and stabilization of psii in higher plants  <cit> . yabe et al. proposed that arabidopsis chloroplastic nifu-like protein, which can act as a fe-s cluster scaffold protein, was required for biogenesis of ferredoxin and photosystem i   <cit> . b-toxicity-induced decreases in the transcript levels of psba, chloroplast psii oxygen-evolving complex 23 kda polypeptide and nifu-like protein genes agree with our report that b-toxicity impaired the whole photosynthetic electron transport from psii donor side up to the reduction of end acceptors of psi in c. grandis leaves  <cit> . by contrast, b-toxicity increased the transcript levels of chloroplast psii oxygen-evolving complex 23 kda polypeptide  and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase b  in c. sinensis leaves . nadp-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is one of the two chloroplast enzymes which catalyze the reduction of 3-phosphoglycerate to triose phosphate  <cit> . however, the expression of rubisco activase  gene in c. sinensis leaves decreased in response to b-toxicity . generally speaking, b-toxic c. sinensis leaves had higher expression levels of photosynthetic genes than b-toxic c. grandis ones. this might be responsible for the greater decrease in co <dig> assimilation in b-toxic c. grandis leaves compared with b-toxic c. sinensis ones. it is noteworthy that the mrna level of gene encoding sedoheptulose- <dig> -bisphosphatase , a key factor for the rubp regeneration, was up-regulated in b-toxic leaves of the two citrus species . harrison et al. showed that a small decrease in sbpase activity caused a decline in co <dig> assimilation by reducing the capacity for rubp regeneration  <cit> . lefebvre et al. observed that transgenic tobacco plants over-expressing sbpase had enhanced photosynthesis and growth from an early stage in development  <cit> . wang reported that transgenic tomato plants over-expressing sbpase were more tolerance to low temperature and had higher photosynthetic capacity under low temperature  <cit> . therefore, the up-regulation of sbpase might be an adaptive response to b-toxicity.

as shown in table  <dig>  b-toxicity decreased leaf expression levels of three genes  related to starch biosynthesis, which agrees with the previous report that b-toxicity decreased starch concentration in c. grandis leaves  <cit> .

b-toxicity increased the mrna levels of three genes encoding citrate synthase , pyruvate dehydrogenase e <dig> component subunit beta  and aconitate hydratase  <dig>  in c. grandis leaves , indicating that tricarboxylic acid cycle might be up-regulated in b-toxic c. grandis leaves. similarly, the transcript level of a glycolysis gene encoding  <dig> -bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase  was enhanced in b-toxic c. sinensis leaves . however, the mrna levels of plastidial pyruvate kinase  <dig>  and aconitate hydratase  <dig>  genes were reduced in b-toxic c. sinensis leaves . there is evidence showing that plastidic pyruvate kinase plays a key role in fatty acid synthesis by controlling the supply of atp and pyruvate for de novo fatty acid synthesis in plastids  <cit> . thus, the fatty acid metabolism in b-toxic c. sinensis leaves might be impaired due to decreased plastidic pyruvate kinase.

in arabidopsis, three nadph: protochlorophyllide oxidoreductases , denoted as pora, porb, and porc participate in mediating the light-dependent protochlorophyllide reduction  <cit> . pattanayak and tripathy showed that over-expression of porc in arabidopsis led to coordinated up-regulation of gene/protein expression of several chl biosynthetic pathway enzymes, thus enhancing chl synthesis, and that the 1o2-mediated photo-oxidative damage in transgenic plants overexpressing porc was minimal under high light stress  <cit> . the observed lower transcript level of porc  in b-toxic c. grandis and c. sinensis leaves  agrees with the results that b-toxicity decreased the concentration of chl a + b in citrus leaves .

cytochrome p450s play a key role in biotic and abiotic stresses. transgenic tobacco and potato plants expressing cytochrome p <dig> with increased monooxygenase activity tolerated better oxidative stress after herbicide treatment  <cit> . we found that b-toxicity increased the expression levels of genes encoding cytochrome p <dig>  and cytochrome p <dig> like protein  in c. grandis leaves , which agrees with the previous report that some of the  <dig> cytochrome p <dig> genes in arabidopsis were upregulated by biotic  and abiotic  stresses  <cit> . thus, the up-regulation of cytochrome p450s in b-toxic c. grandis leaves might be an adaptive response. however, b-toxicity decreased the expression of cytochrome p <dig> in arabidopsis roots  <cit> .

taken all together, we isolated eight up-regulated and eight down-regulated tdfs from b-toxic c. grandis leaves, and five up-regulated and nine down-regulated from b-toxic c. sinesnsis ones. among these differentially expressed tdfs, only sbpase  and porc  were similarly affected by b-toxicity in the two species . these results demonstrated that the transcript profiles in the two species were differentially altered under b-toxicity.

leaf lipid metabolism
allene oxide synthase  and hydroperoxide lyase  branches of the oxylipin pathway, which are responsible for the production of jasmonates and aldehydes, respectively, participate in a range of stresses. recently, liu et al. showed that depletion of rice oshpl <dig> greatly stimulated the jasmonic acid-governed defense response  <cit> . therefore, the aos pathway and jasmonate level might be up-regulated in the b-toxic c. sinensis leaves due to decreased expression of fatty acid hpl , thus contributing to b-tolerance. in addition, b-toxicity also affected the transcript levels of three genes  related to lipid metabolism in c. sinensis leaves . thus, lipid metabolism might be altered in b-toxic c. sinensis leaves.

tang et al. reported that transgenic tobacco plants over-expressing acyl carrier protein - <dig>  exhibited an increase  in leaf concentrations of total lipids and the main fatty acids, and were more tolerant  to cold stress  <cit> . branen et al. showed that reduction of acp <dig> by antisense rna led to a decrease in total leaf lipids and decreased photosynthetic efficiency, and concluded that acp <dig> might play a major role in the biosynthesis of fatty acids for chloroplast membrane development  <cit> . the lower transcript level of gene encoding acp <dig>  chloroplastic-like  in b-toxic c. grandis leaves  means that fatty acid biosynthesis in these leaves might be impaired. however, the expression of α/β-hydrolase domain-containing protein  and phospholipase-like protein  domain-containing protein  genes were up-regulated in b-toxic c. grandis leaves .

leaf nucleic acid metabolism
as shown in table  <dig>  eight up-regulated genes  and nine down-regulated genes  were isolated from b-toxic c. grandis leaves, while only five up-regulated genes  and four down-regulated genes  were identified in b-toxic c. sinensis leaves. obviously, b-toxicity affected nucleic acid metabolism more in c. grandis leaves than in c. sinensis ones. this agrees with our inference that c. sinensis may tolerate higher level of b.

leaf protein and amino acid metabolism
all these differentially expressed tdfs encoding chloroplatic translation initiation factor if- <dig>  involved in promoting the binding of formylmethionyl-trna to 30 s ribosomal subunits, eukaryotic release factor 1– <dig>  involved in the termination step of protein synthesis, emb <dig>  related to protein folding and stabilization, ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein  involved mainly in mediating protein-protein interactions, and ribosomal proteins  related to mature ribosome assembly and translation processes except for shepherd  involved in the correct folding and/or complex formation of clavata  proteins  <cit> , 60s ribosomal protein l <dig>  and 60s ribosomal protein l10b , were down-regulated in b-toxic c. grandis leaves , indicating that b-toxicity impairs protein biosynthesis in c. grandis leaves  <cit> . by contrast, only three down-regulated genes  were detected in b-toxic c. sinensis leaves . these results demonstrated that b-toxicity affected protein biosynthesis more in the former than in the latter. this agrees with our data that b-toxicity only decreased total soluble protein concentration in c. grandis leaves .

here we observed four down-regulated genes  and three up-regulated genes  involved in phosphorylation and one up-regulated gene  involved in dephosphorylation in b-toxic c. grandis leaves, while only one down-regulated gene  and one up-regulated gene  in b-toxic c. sinensis leaves . this means that c. sinensis leaves might achieve a better balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation than c. grandis ones under b-toxicity, which might contribute to the b-tolerance of c. sinensis.

inactive  and futile proteins for cell are tagged by ubiquitin for proteolysis  <cit> . in this study, we found four up-regulated genes  and three down-regulated genes  involved in ubiquitination in b-toxic c. grandis leaves, and one up-regulated gene  and two down-regulated genes  involved in ubiquitination in b-toxici c. sinensis leaves. this indicates that ubiquitination might be involved in the adaptive response of citrus leaves to b-toxicity. plant proteases has been shown to play key roles in controlling strict protein quality and degrading specific sets of proteins in response to environmental stresses  <cit> . as expected, several genes  involved in proteolysis were altered in b-toxic c. grandis and c. sinensis leaves .

s-adenosylmethionine  participates in a number of essential metabolic pathways in plants and is the principal biological methyl donor. adomet-dependent methylation is essential for keeping cellular functions in plants  <cit> . methionine synthase, which catalyzes the last reaction in de novo methionine synthesis, also serves to regenerate the methyl group of adomet. as shown in table  <dig>  b-toxicity increased the expression of at4g <dig>  involved in adomet biosynthesis in c. sinensis leaves, but decreased methionine synthase expression  in c. grandis leaves, which might contribute to the higher tolerance of c. sinensis leaves to b-toxicity than that of c. grandis ones.

n-carbamoylputrescine amidase  involved in polyamine  biosynthesis were down-regulated in b-toxic c. grandis leaves . this means that the biosynthesis of polyamine might be inhibited in b-toxic c. grandis leaves, which disagrees with the previous report that 1000 μm b increased leaf concentration of putrescine in b-sensitive barley cultivar, but decreased its concentration in b-tolerant one  <cit> .

the up-regulation of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase gene  in b-toxic c. grandis leaves  agrees with the reports that b-toxicity stimulated the general amino acid control system in saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit>  and that the concentration of total amino acids in tomato leaves increased under b-toxicity  <cit> . evidence shows that 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase participates in glucosinolate biosynthesis  <cit> . thus, the concentration of glucosinolates might be enhanced in b-toxic c. grandis leaves.

there is evidence showing that a few cystathionine-β-synthase  domain-containing proteins  play a role in plant stress response/tolerance and development  <cit> . overexpression of oscbsx <dig> improved tobacco plant tolerance to salinity, oxidative, and heavy metal stresses  <cit> . we observed that b-toxicity decreased the transcript level of cdcp  in c. sinensis leaves , as obtained on manganese -toxic c. grandis leaves  <cit> . however, b-deficient c. sinensis roots had higher level of cbs family protein  <cit> . singh et al. observed that the expression of oscbsx <dig> was up-regulated under high salinity, heavy metal, and oxidative stresses at seedling stage of a salt tolerant  rice cultivar, whilst its expression was upregulated only under nacl stress, downregulated under heavy metal stress and kept unchanged under oxidative stress in a salt sensitive  rice one  <cit> . taken all together, the influence of stresses on expression of cdcp genes deponds on the kinds of stresses and plant species/cultivars.

leaf stress responses
inorganic pyrophosphatase , which cleaves pyrophosphate molecules to liberate two molecules of inorganic phosphate, are essential for the viability of organisms, because the removal of pyrophosphate, a by-product of a host of biosynthetic reactions, is required for preventing the inhibition of thermodynamically unfavorable reactions  <cit> . george et al. observed that nicotiana benthamiana plants lacking plastidial soluble ppase exhibited reduced drought tolerance as a result of the impaired leaf anabolic pathways  <cit> . the up-regulation of ppase  <dig>  in b-toxic c. sinensis leaves  might be an adaptive response to b-toxicity. by contrast, its expression  was down-regulated in b-toxic c. grandis leaves .

because leaf co <dig> assimilation was decreased in b-toxic leaves , less of the absorbed light energy was utilized in photosynthetic electron transport in these leaves, particularly under high light. thus, reactive oxygen species  production might be enhanced in b-toxic leaves because of more excess absorbed photon flux  <cit> . in addition to various ros scavenger enzymes, “house-keeping” enzymes such as nudix hydrolases  also play a role in ros scavenging. ogawa et al.  <cit>  and ishikawa et al.  <cit>  showed that transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing atnudx <dig> and atnudx <dig> exhibited higher tolerance to oxidative stress than wild type plants. therefore, the higher expression level of nudx <dig>  in b-toxic c. sinensis leaves might be an adaptive response to b-toxicity . however, its expression level  in c. grandis leaves decreased in response to b-toxicity .

up to 10% of the ascorbate content of the whole leaf is localized in the apoplast, where it forms the first line of defense against external oxidants  <cit> . in the apoplast, ascorbate oxidase  oxidizes ascorbate to the unstable radical monodehydroascorbate which rapidly disproportionates to yield dehydroascorbate and ascorbate, thus participating in the regulation of the redox state of ascorbic acid pool. ao has been suggested to play a role in cell expansion via the modulation of redox control of the apoplast  <cit> . pignocchi et al.  <cit>  showed that enhanced ao activity decreased the concentration and the redox state of ascorbic acid pool in the apoplast, whereas reduced ao activity increased its amount and redox state in the apoplast. overexpression of ao in the apoplast of tobacco resulted in lowered capacity for scavenging ros in the leaf apoplast accompanied by increased sensitivity to ozone  <cit> . fotopoulos et al.  <cit>  observed that ao-overexpressing transgenic tobacco plants had increased sensitivity to various oxidative stress-promoting agents accompanied by a general suppression of the plant antioxidative metabolism. by contrast, a diminution in ao activity improved tomato yield under water deficit  <cit> . the down-regulation of gene encoding fe /ascorbate oxidase family protein srg <dig>  in b-toxic c. sinensis leaves  might increase the amount and the redox state of aa pool in the apoplast, thus enhancing the b-tolerance.

thioredoxins, which participates in supplying reducing power to reductases required for detoxifying lipid hydroperoxides or repairing oxidized proteins, play key roles in plant tolerance of oxidative stress  <cit> . we found that the expression level of thioredoxin superfamily protein  was up-regulated in b-toxic c. grandis leaves , indicating that thioredoxins might be involved in the ros detoxification. however, the transcript level of thioredoxin superfamily protein  gene was down-regulated in b-toxic c. grandis leaves.

our finding that b-toxicity increased the expression level of group  <dig> late embryogenesis abundant protein  in c. grandis leaves  agrees with the previous report that drought, heat and salt stresses stimulated the expression of lea <dig> in citrus leaves  <cit> . accumulation of atrab <dig>  protein in arabidopsis through transgenic approach improved the germination rate under standard conditions or salt and osmotic stresses and the cation toxicity tolerance  <cit> . also, b-toxicity increased the transcript level of thaumatin-like protein  <dig>  in c. grandis leaves . the family of thaumatin-like proteins , which comprises proteins with various functions, is induced by biotic and abiotic factors in plants  <cit> . therefore, the up-regulation of lea <dig> and tlp <dig> in b-toxic c. grandis leaves might be an adaptive response.

protein sodium-and lithium-tolerant  <dig>  gene isolated from tobacco  and a. thaliana  has been implicated in mediating salt tolerance by regulating na+ homeostasis via the calcineurin  and spk1/hal <dig>  signal transduction  <cit> . later, antoine et al.  <cit>  showed that rice osslt <dig> had molecular chaperone activity in vitro, and that osslt <dig> could be an important component of the cell immediate defenses against possible protein denaturation and aggregation. the down-regulation of slt <dig>  in b-toxic c. grandis leaves  means that na+ homeostasis or related processes mediated by slt <dig> are impaired in b-toxic c. grandis leaves.

plant autophagy plays a role in various stress responses, pathogen defense, and senescence  <cit> . xiong et al.  <cit>  showed that atatg18a was necessary for the formation of autophagosomes during nutrient stress and senescence in a. thaliana and that autophagy participated in the degradation of oxidized proteins under oxidative stress conditions in arabidopsis. atatg18a rnai plants usually senesce earlier and have lower tolerance to various stresses including drought, salt and oxidative stresses compared with wild-type plants  <cit> . our result showed that the transcript level of transducin/wd <dig> domain-containing protein  in c. sinensis leaves decreased in response to b-toxicity , indicating that autophagy is impaired in c. sinensis leaves.

as shown in table  <dig>  b-toxicity down-regulated the expression of “cold-regulated” gene  in c. sinensis leaves and universal stress protein a-like protein  in c. grandis leaves , indicating that b-toxicity might affect the tolerance of plants to other stresses.

leaf signal transduction
here four genes involved in signal transduction were altered by b-toxicity . evidence shows that that signal recognition particle 54 kda protein  plays important roles in chloroplast development  <cit> . the down-regulation of signal recognition particle 54 kda protein  <dig>  in b-toxic c. grandis leaves  means that the biosynthesis of chl is impaired in these leaves. this agrees with our results that b-toxicity affected chl more in c. grandis leaves than in c. sinensis ones .

increasing evidence shows that 14-3- <dig> proteins play an important role in plant stress responses  <cit> . the most direct evidence for the role of 14-3- <dig> proteins in stress responses comes from transgenic rice plants over-expressing zmgf14- <dig> encoding a maize 14-3- <dig> protein  <cit>  and cotton plants over-expressing arabidopsis 14-3-3λ  <cit> . these transgenic plants displayed enhanced tolerance to drought stress. heterotrimeric gtp-binding proteins  are signaling molecules required for various eukaryotic organisms. joo et al.  <cit>  observed that a. thaliana mutant plants losing the gβ protein were less tolerant to o <dig> damage than wild-type plants. thus, the b-tolerance of c. grandis leaves might be down-regulated due to decreased transcript level of genes encoding 14-3- <dig> protein  and heterotrimeric gtp-binding protein subunit beta  <dig>  .

in higher plants, the endogenous circadian clock is involved in the manipulation of different various cellular processes ranging from photosynthesis to stress responses  <cit> . it also confers plants with competitive advantages, including improved photosynthesis, growth and survival  <cit> . nakamichi et al.  <cit>  observed that a prr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> triple mutant of arabidopsis had higher tolerance against drought, salt and cold stresses compared to wild type, demonstrating the involvement of the three genes in abiotic stress responses as negative regulators. the up-regulation of pseudo-response regulator  <dig>  in b-toxic c. sinensis leaves  agrees with the previous reports that prr <dig> was induced by cold treatment in apical shoots of cassava  <cit>  and in arabidopsis leaves  <cit> . fukushima et al.  <cit>  showed that prr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> negatively regulated the biosynthetic pathways of chl, car, aba and α-tocopherol. this agrees with our results that b-toxici c. sinensis leaves had decreased concentrations of chl a + b and car .

leaf cell transport
as shown in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  the number of differentially expressed tdfs involved in cell transport was far less in b-toxic c. sinensis leaves than in b-toxic c. grandis ones, meaning that cell transport is less affected in the former than in the latter, which agrees with our inference that c. sinensis leaves may tolerate higher level of b.

most of the differentially expressed tdfs  associated with cell transport were up-regulated in b-toxic c. grandis leaves except for at5g24810/f6a4_ <dig> , protein transport protein sec <dig> γ subunit  and putative β-subunit of adaptor protein complex  <dig>  pat <dig>  , indicating that cell transport might be enhanced in b-toxic c. grandis leaves. plasma-membrane h+-atpase plays a crucial role in the plant response to environmental stresses, such as salt stress, aluminum  stress, p and potassium  deficiencies  <cit> . wu et al.  <cit>  reported that pumping of ca2+ and mn2+ by an endoplasmic reticulum-type ca2+-atpase  into the endoplasmic reticulum was necessary for maintaining plant growth under calcium -deficiency or mn-toxicity. the pib-atpases , which are involved in heavy metal transport across cellular membranes, play a crucial role in metal homeostasis and detoxification in plants  <cit> . proton pump interactor  <dig> , an interactor of plasma-membrane h+-atpase, stimulates its activity in vitro  <cit> . the up-regulation of ppi <dig>  in b-toxic leaves agrees with our data that the transcript level of h+-atpase  <dig>  in c. grandis leaves increased in response to b-toxicity  and with the report that the expression of ppi <dig> in potato tuber was up-regulated by salt stress and cold  <cit> .

atp-binding cassette  transporters are involved in metal ion efflux from the plasma-membrane. atpdr <dig>  an abc transporter localized in the plasma-membrane of a. thaliana root hairs and epidermal cells, confers metal tolerance  <cit> . our finding that the expression of abc transporter g family member  <dig>  gene was up-regulated in b-toxic c. grandis leaves agrees with the reports that atpdr <dig> in arabidopsis roots and shoots was induced when exposed to copper , cadmium  and lead   <cit> , and that abc transporter g family member  <dig> gene and abc transporter a family member  <dig> gene were induced in drought-sensitive and -tolerant genotypes of gossypium herbaceum, respectively under drought stress  <cit> . however, the expression of at5g24810/f6a4_ <dig>  was down-regulated in b-toxic c. grandis leaves .

cu transporters  are involved in the maintenance of cu homeostasis in plants. generally speaking, copts/ctrs are up-regulated by cu deprivation and down-regulated by cu excess  <cit> . copt <dig> antisense arabidopsis plants have decreased cu level due to decreased cu uptake and display sensitivity to cu chelators  <cit> . the up-regulation of copt  in b-toxic c. grandis leaves might play a role in the maintenance of leaf cu homeostasis.

plant cyclic nucleotide gated channels  paly a role in heavy metal homeostasis. previous study showed that transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing a truncated ntcbp <dig>  had higher tolerance to pb compared with wild type  <cit> . chan et al.  <cit>  reported that cngc <dig> arabidopsis mutants were hypersensitive to increased soil ca. however, transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing ntcbp <dig> were hypersensitivity to pb  <cit> . b-toxicity-induced increase in transcript level of cngc <dig>  in c. grandis leaves  agrees with the report that the expression of atcngc <dig> was induced during arabidopsis leaf senescence and atcngc <dig> might be involved in programmed cell death  <cit> .

membrane traffic is not only required for plant normal cellular function and maintenance of cellular viability, but also plays an important roles in plant responses to the environment  <cit> . the transcript levels of genes  involved in membrane traffic increased in b-toxic c. grandis leaves except for genes encoding protein transport protein sec <dig> γ subunit  and putative β-subunit of adaptor protein complex  <dig>  pat <dig>  . this indicates that membrane traffic might be enhanced in b-toxic c. grandis leaves.

plant sieve element occlusion  genes have been shown to encode the common phloem proteins  that plug sieve plates after wounding. tobacco seo-rna interference lines were essentially devoid of p-protein structures and lost photoassimilates more rapidly after injury than control plants  <cit> . therefore, the up-regulation of sieve element occlusion protein  <dig> gene  in b-toxic c. grandis leaves  might be of advantage to prevent the loss of photoassimilates. recently, huang et al. observed that many electron-dense particles deposited near sieve plates of b-toxic c. grandis and c. sinensis leaves  <cit> . in conclusion, the up-regulation of cell transport in b-toxic c. grandis leaves might be an adaptive response of plants to b-toxicity.

by contrast, we isolated three down-regulated  and three up-regulated [i.e., sieve element occlusion protein  <dig> , kinesin-related protein  and bidirectional sugar transporter sweet <dig>  tdfs from b-toxic c. sinensis leaves . generally speaking, cell transport might be not enhanced in b-toxicity leaves.

in plants, kinesins are involved in a variety of cellular processes including intracellular transport, spindle assembly, phragmoplast assembly, chromosome motility, map kinase regulation and microtubule stability  <cit> . li et al.  <cit>  reported that mutation of rice bc12/gdd <dig> encoding a kinesin-like protein led to dwarfism with impaired cell elongation. nishihama et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the expansion of the cell plate in tobacco plant cytokinesis required kinesin-like proteins  to regulate the activity and localization of map kinase kinase kinase. therefore, the up-regulation of kinesin-like protein  in c. sinensis leaves  might be an adaptive responsive to b-toxicity. however, the transcript level of putative β-subunit of adaptor protein complex  <dig>  pat <dig>  in c. sinensis leaves decreased in response to b-toxicity .

plant sweets function as facilitators involved in the influx and the efflux of sugar into and out of cells  <cit> . we found that the expression level of sweet <dig>  in c. sinensis leaves increased in response to b-toxicity , which agrees with the previous report that sweet15/sag <dig> was enhanced in senescing arabidopsis leaves  <cit> . however, the expression of gene encoding sugar transporter erd6-like  <dig> , a passive facilitator for the diffusion of glucose across the tonoplast membrane, was down-regulated in b-toxic c. sinensis leaves . this disagrees with the previous report that the expression of atesl <dig>  was induced by various stresses including drought, high salinity and aba in arabidopsis plants  <cit> .

mtps are a subfamily of the cation diffusion facilitator  family found in plants. so far, most studied cdf family members confer heavy metal tolerance by affecting heavy metal efflux from the cytoplasm  <cit> . the down-regulation of mtp  in c. sinensis leaves  means that the tolerance of plants to heavy metal might be reduced in b-toxic plants. this agrees with our previous report that the tolerance of c. grandis plants to al-toxicity was higher under adequate b supply than under excess b  <cit> .

leaf cell wall and cytoskeleton modification
eleven tdfs associated with cell wall and cytoskeleton modification were altered by b-toxicity . o-methyltransferase  genes are involved in lignin biosynthesis. fu et al.  <cit>  showed that down-regulation of the caffeic acid 3-o-methyltransferase  gene in switchgrass lowered lignin level in whole tillers and stems of transgenic plants and enhanced forage quality. transgenic leucaena leucocephala plants expressing antisense omt displayed decreased activity of omt activity and concentration of lignin  <cit> . therefore, the biosynthesis of lignin in b-toxic c. grandis and c. sinensis leaves might be reduced due to decreased expression of comt  and comt <dig>  . in addition, the biosynthesis of chitin in c. grandis and c. sinensis leaves and cellulose in c. grandis leaves might be down-regulated under b-toxicity due to the down-regulation of chitinase  and cellulose synthase  . these results demonstrated that b-toxicity might impair citrus cell wall metabolism, which agrees with the previous suggestion that leaf cupping, a specific visible b-toxic symptom in some species might be due to the inhibition of cell wall expansion, through disturbance of cell wall crosslinks  <cit> . however, the transcript levels of genes encoding omt <dig> , lim domain-containing protein , udp-glucose flavonoid 7-o-glucosyltransferase , udp-glucosyltransferase family  <dig> protein , limonoid udp-glucosyltransferase  and putative glucosyltransferase  in c. grandis increased in response to b-toxicity .

evidence shows that lily lim <dig>  <cit>  and all arabidopsis lim domain proteins  <cit>  participate in regulating actin cytoskeleton organization and dynamics. tobacco lim <dig> protein acts in the cytoplasm as an actin binding and bundling protein  <cit>  and in the nucleus as a transcription factor regulating the expression of genes related to lignin biosynthesis  <cit> . recently, moes et al.  <cit>  demonstrated the involvement of tobacco lim <dig> in actin-bundling and histone gene transcription. the up-regulation of lim domain-containing protein  in b-toxic c. grandis leaves  agrees with the report that the expression of lim domain-containing protein in physcomitrella patens increased under cold acclimation  <cit> .

glycosyltransferases , which catalyze the formation of glycosidic bonds between donor sugars and acceptor molecules, participate in many aspects of a plant life, including cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> . in arabidopsis, up to  <dig> or  <dig> gt <dig> family members form the cellulose synthase catalytic subunit and callose synthase gene families  <cit> . in plants, udp-glucosyltransferases  have been suggested to play important roles in keeping cell homeostasis, regulating plant growth and improving their tolerance to environmental stresses  <cit> . overexpression of ugt74e <dig> conferred tolerance to salinity and drought stresses in a. thaliana  <cit> . transgenic tobacco plants overexpressiong ugt85a <dig> exhibited enhanced salt tolerance  <cit> . therefore, the up-regulation of udp-glucose flavonoid 7-o-glucosyltransferase , ugt family  <dig> protein , limonoid ugt  and putative gt  genes in b-toxic c. grandis leaves  might play a role in b-tolerance of plants. however, loss of function of a ugt73b <dig> alone or in conjunction with ugt73b <dig> and ugt73b <dig> resulted in enhanced oxidative stress tolerance in arabidopsis, whilst transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing ugt73b <dig> displayed decreased oxidative stress tolerance  <cit> .

others
overexpression of bacterial or plant gene encoding phytoene synthase , a key regulatory enzyme in car biosynthesis, led to enhanced level of total car in various higher plants  <cit> . transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing psy from euhalophyte salicornia europaea had higher tolerance to salt stress than wild type plants by enhanced photosynthetic efficiency and antioxidative capacity  <cit> . cidade et al.  <cit>  showed that ectopic expression of psy from citrus paradisi fruit conferred abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic tobacco, which was correlated with the increased endogenous aba level and expression of stress-responsive genes. our finding that b-toxic c. grandis leaves had lower transcript of psy  means that the biosynthesis of car and the antioxidative capacity may be decreased in b-toxic leaves. this agrees with our data that b-toxicity affected car more in c. grandis leaves than in c. sinensis one  and the inference that c. grandis may tolerate lower level of b.

strictosidine synthase , a key enzyme in alkaloid biosynthesis, catalyzes the condensation of tryptamine and secologanin leading to the synthesis of numerous monoterpenoid indole alkaloids in higher plants  <cit> . the up-regulation of str family protein gene  in b-toxic c. sinensis leaves  agrees with the previous report that str in catharanthus roseus leaves was enhanced under dehydration, salt and uv stresses  <cit>  and that b-toxicity decreased iaa level in triticum durum seedlings  <cit> , because the expression of str was inhibited by auxin  <cit> . b-toxicity-induced up-regulation of str family protein gene  also agrees with our reference that the aos pathway and jasmonate level might be up-regulated in the b-toxic c. sinensis leaves due to decreased expression of fatty acid hpl gene  , because str has been shown to be induced by jasmonate  <cit> . by contrast, the expression of str family protein gene  was down-regulated in b-toxic c. grandis leaves , which agrees with the previous report that cold stress led to str down-regulation in c. roseus leaves  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
b-toxicity affected c. grandis seedling growth, leaf co <dig> assimilation, pigments, total soluble protein, mda and p more than c. sinensis, indicating that c. sinensis have higher b-tolerance than c. grandis ones. under b-toxicity, c. sinensis leaves accumulated more b than c. grandis ones, meaning that the former may tolerate higher level of b. using cdna-aflp, we successfully isolated  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated tdfs from b-toxic c. grandis leaves, whilst only  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated tdfs from b-toxic c. sinensis ones. this indicates that gene expression is less affected in b-toxic c. sinensis leaves than in c. grandis ones, which might be associated with the fact that c. sinensis leaves can tolerate higher level of b. the higher b-tolerance of c. sinensis might be related to the findings that b-toxic c. sinensis leaves had higher expression levels of genes involved in photosynthesis, which might contribute to the higher photosynthesis and light utilization and less excess light energy compared to the b-toxic c. grandis ones, and in ros scavenging, thus preventing them from photo-oxidative damage. in addition, b-toxicity-induced alteration in the expression levels of genes encoding inorganic ppase  <dig>  at4g <dig> and methionine synthase differed between the two species, which might also contribute to the b-tolerance of c. sinensis. in this study, a total of  <dig> differentially expressed tdfs were isolated from two citrus species, only  <dig> tdfs presented in the two citrus, the remaining tdfs presented only in c. grandis or c. sinensis, demonstrating that the b-toxicity-responsive genes differ between the two citrus species. for example, cell transport were up-regulated in b-toxicity c. grandis leaves, whilst this did not occur in b-toxic c. sinensis ones.
