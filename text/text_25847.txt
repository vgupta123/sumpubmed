BACKGROUND
oxylipins are a diverse group of oxygenated fatty acids which are involved in controlling plant development and defense against microbial pathogens and insects  <cit> . the biosynthesis of oxylipins is catalyzed by fatty acid oxygenases including lipoxygenases  and α-dioxygenases , which add molecular oxygen to polyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly linolenic  and linoleic  acids leading to hydroperoxide formation  <cit> . while loxs are located in chloroplasts  <cit> , α-doxs are found in oil bodies and endoplasmic reticulum-like structures  <cit> . loxs catalyze the incorporation of molecular oxygen into these fatty acids at either carbon positions  <dig> or  <dig>  leading to 9- and 13-hydroperoxy fatty acids, which are further metabolized to various lipid mediators including jasmonates and volatile aldehydes  <cit> . lox-derived oxylipins have important functions in a variety of plant processes such as seed development, germination, vegetative growth, lateral root development and in defense responses against wounding, insect feeding and microbial infection  <cit> . α-doxs add molecular oxygen to the α-carbon  of a broad range of fatty acids leading to the formation of chemically unstable 2-hydroperoxy fatty acids which are either reduced to 2-hydroxy fatty acid or spontaneously decarboxylated to the corresponding shorter chain fatty aldehyde  <cit> . two main groups of α-doxs have been described in flowering plants. the α-dox <dig> type enzymes are mainly involved in defense responses against microbial infection and herbivores, while the α-dox <dig> type enzymes are more related to development. α-dox <dig> transcripts accumulate rapidly in tobacco, arabidopsis thaliana and capsicum annuum leaves after pathogen assault  <cit> . a. thaliana plants with low or null α-dox <dig> activity are more susceptible to pseudomonas syringae, as evidenced by increased bacterial growth and symptom development in inoculated leaves, suggesting a possible role in protecting plant tissues against oxidative stress and cell death generated by pathogens  <cit> . in addition, arabidopsis α-dox <dig> mutants showed an impaired systemic response against p. syringae in distal leaves  <cit> . in nicotiana attenuata α-dox <dig> transcripts are weakly induced by pathogen infection, while naα-dox <dig> is highly expressed by herbivore attack and plays an important role in the anti-herbivore defense response of this plant  <cit> . in tomato and a. thaliana α-dox <dig> is also needed for basal resistance against aphids  <cit> . the second isoform, α-dox <dig>  is expressed in a. thaliana seedlings, during senescence induced by detachment of a. thaliana leaves and in flowers, while it is not induced after pathogen inoculation  <cit> . naα-dox <dig> is expressed in senescent leaves, in flowers and roots but not in seedlings  <cit> . solanum lycopersicum knockout mutants of α-dox <dig> and n. attenuata co-silenced α-dox <dig> and α-dox <dig> plants have a stunted phenotype  <cit> . the latter result suggests that naα-dox <dig> can also regulate development and has distinct and overlapping function with naα-dox <dig>  <cit> . complementation of tomato α-dox <dig> mutant with atα-dox <dig> partially restores the compromised growth phenotype  <cit> . however, a. thaliana α-dox <dig> mutant did not have an altered developmental phenotype  <cit> , suggesting that the role played by α-dox <dig> in development is species specific.

the moss physcomitrella patens is an excellent plant model species to perform functional studies of individual genes by reverse genetics, due to its high rate of homologous recombination, comparable to yeast cells, that enables targeted gene disruption  <cit> . in addition, given its phylogenetic position as an early diverging land plant between green algae and flowering plants, it represents an interesting model plant to perform evolutionary studies of the role played by genes in developmental and defense processes. p. patens is infected by several known plant pathogens, including pectobacterium species, botrytis cinerea, and pythium species, and in response to infection defense mechanisms similar to those induced in flowering plants are activated  <cit> . recently, several studies have shown that in p. patens the lox pathway is similar to that of flowering plants but it presents some unique features. in addition to 18: <dig> and 18: <dig> unsaturated c <dig> fatty acids, c <dig> fatty acids, which are absent in flowering plants, are substrates for p. patens loxs leading to the formation of a structurally diverse group of oxylipins  <cit> . while p. patens accumulates the precursor of jasmonic acid, 12-oxophytodienoic acid , in response to pathogen infection or wounding  <cit> , no jasmonic acid has been detected, suggesting that only the plastid-localized part of the lox pathway is present in this moss  <cit> . p. patens has only one gene encoding a putative α-dox ; this showed 49–53% identity to α-doxs of flowering plants and possessed the two conserved heme-binding histidines  <cit> . ppα-dox activity was detected in homogenized tissues of p. patens leading to the generation of 2-hydroxypalmitic acid  <cit> . the expression of the putative ppα-dox in a baculovirus system further showed that this enzyme is capable of oxygenating 3-oxalinolenic acid similarly to atα-dox <dig> leading to the production of the same oxylipins  <cit> . in this study, we have analyzed ppα-dox function in more detail. we showed that ppα-dox is highly expressed in mitotically active apical cells of protonemal filaments and rhizoids, in auxin-producing cells of gametophores, and in pathogen-infected and elicitor-treated tissues. ppα-dox knockout mutants did not have a visible developmental alteration and were not compromised in the defense response. however, overexpressing ppα-dox, or treating wild-type plants with ppα-dox-derived oxylipins, altered moss development and led to reduced cellular damage caused by p. carotovorum elicitors.

RESULTS
p. patens α-dioxygenase activity
in previous work, we obtained high five insect cells containing recombinant ppα-dox-expressing baculovirus  <cit>  and the products formed by α-oxygenation of 16: <dig> were determined  <cit> . here, homogenates of these insect cells were incubated with different fatty acids, leading to the generation of 2-hydroperoxides as shown by the identification of the corresponding aldehydes and 2-hydroxy acids . the fatty acid substrate specificity of ppα-dox was determined by oxygen consumption assays and the results showed that palmitic , linoleic  and linolenic acid  were the most efficiently oxygenated substrates . under our experimental conditions, ppα-dox was not capable of using arachidonic acid  as a substrate. no α-dox activity was detected when homogenates from high five insect cells infected with baculovirus prepared from empty pfastbac vector were incubated with different fatty acids. these results confirm that ppα-dox is an α-dioxygenase, and demonstrate that it can oxygenate fatty acids with preferences for palmitic , linoleic  and linolenic acid . the products obtained , i.e. the 2-hydroxy derivatives of 16: <dig>  18: <dig> and 18: <dig> and the aldehydes pentadecanal,  <dig> -heptadecadienal and  <dig> ,14-heptadecatrienal were identified by gc-ms analysis as previously described  <cit> . further support for the formation of pentadecanal and 2-hydroxy-16: <dig> from 16: <dig> was provided by gc-ms analyses run in the selected-ion-monitoring mode using synthetically prepared trideuterated standards .figure  <dig>

phylogenetic relationship of ppα-dox and other plant α-dioxygenases
expanding previous phylogenetic analyses of plant α-doxs  <cit> , a phylogenetic tree was constructed with ppα-dox and other confirmed and putative α-doxs, including a putative algae α-dox. full-length amino acid sequences were aligned with clustal w, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor joining method using mega version  <dig>  software . the tree shows four clear clusters, one represented by α-dox <dig> type enzymes and another by α-dox <dig> type enzymes from flowering plants. ppα-dox and its lycophyte α-dox homologue , form a clearly separated cluster from α-doxs of flowering plants at the base of the plant clade. the putative α-dox of the multicellular green algae volvox carteri is placed in the fourth separate cluster.figure  <dig>

ppα-dox-gus accumulation patterns during gametophyte development
to investigate the spatiotemporal expression patterns of the ppα-dox gene in p. patens tissues, the reporter uida gene encoding β-glucuronidase , was inserted in frame just before the stop codon of the ppα-dox gene by means of homologous recombination. after transformation, two stable ppα-dox-gus lines, ppα-dox-gus- <dig> and ppα-dox-gus- <dig>  expressing the corresponding fusion proteins from the native ppα-dox promoter were selected for further studies . haploidy of both lines was confirmed by measuring nuclear dna content . results from pcr-based genotyping and southern blot analysis showed that ppα-dox-gus- <dig> has incorporated one single copy of the construct by two events of homologous recombination in the ppα-dox locus, while ppα-dox-gus- <dig> showed an integration event at only one border and had more than one insertion in its genome . ppα-dox-gus- <dig> α-dox activity was similar as wild-type plants, while ppα-dox-gus- <dig> did not show α-dox activity. differences in integration events leading to differences in protein folding could explain the lack or presence of ppα-dox activity in these lines. to discard the presence of a wild-type copy of ppα-dox adjacent to the inserted construct in ppα-dox-gus- <dig>  pcr amplification was performed using primers dox3f+3′doxr. the corresponding fragment of  <dig> pb was only amplified in the wt, indicating the absence of a full wild-type copy in the transformants . both reporter lines revealed identical overall gus staining patterns, suggesting that α-dox derived oxylipins do not affect ppα-dox-gus expression . ppα-dox-gus protein accumulation pattern in the juvenile gametophyte phase revealed their presence in tips of protonemal filaments growing at the edge of the colonies . the highest ppα-dox-gus accumulation occurs in protonemal apical cells, gradually diminishes in the adjacent differentiated subapical cells, and is absent in the remaining older proximate protonemal cells . leafy gametophores showed ppα-dox expression in short and long rhizoids with maximum expression levels in apical cells of rhizoids , and in axillary hairs and the shoot apex . ppα-dox-gus accumulation was also observed in some parts of the cauloid while no visible staining was detectable in leaves . this expression pattern correlates with sites of auxin synthesis and auxin response in gametophores  <cit> . we therefore decided to evaluate auxin responsiveness of the ppα-dox promoter in moss colonies grown in the presence of 5 μm naa for 2 days. ppα-dox-gus expression was clearly enhanced after naa treatment in cauloids and leaves of gametophores . apical cells of protonemal filaments and rhizoids are mitotically active cells, with characteristics of stem cells  <cit> , suggesting that ppα-dox expression is enhanced in these type of cells. we therefore analyzed ppα-dox-gus expression in other p. patens stem cells, including cells of detached gametophore leaves which divide and give rise to chloronemal apical stem cells  <cit> , and apical cells from regenerating protoplasts  <cit> . the results show that ppα-dox is expressed in cells that divide after leaf detachment , and in chloronemal apical stem cells from dissected leaves which start to protrude with tip growth . in addition, ppα-dox-gus expression was detected in regenerating protoplasts, which start tip growth by dividing asymmetrically with the maximum expression levels in apical cells . after several days of protoplasts regeneration, ppα-dox-gus accumulation disappeared in the central nondividing protonemal cells. taken together, the results indicate that ppα-dox is highly expressed in mitotically active cells, in auxin producing sites of gametophores, and in cauloids and leaves of auxin-treated plants.figure  <dig>

ppa-dox is induced after pathogen infection and elicitor treatment
since α-dox <dig> expression is induced after pathogen infection in flowering plants  <cit> , ppα-dox transcript levels were evaluated in moss tissues in response to treatment with elicitors of pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum  , and inoculation with spores of botrytis cinerea . ppα-dox expression increased significantly after 8 hours with p.c. carotovorum elicitor treatment and after 24 hours with b. cinerea inoculation , which correlates with an increase of fungal biomass  <cit> . ppα-dox activity increased significantly after 24 hours treatment with p.c. carotovorum elicitors and b. cinerea spores suspension . in the ppα-dox-gus- <dig> reporter line ppα-dox expression increased in protonemal tissues and leaves treated with elicitors of p.c. carotovorum or infected with b. cinerea, compared to control tissues . ppα-dox-gus- <dig> revealed identical gus staining patterns . semi-quantitative rt-pcr confirmed the presence of ppα-dox-gus fused transcripts only in ppα-dox-gus- <dig>  probably due to the multiple integration events in ppα-dox-gus- <dig>  in ppα-dox-gus- <dig>  levels of the fused ppα-dox-gus transcript increased in elicitors-treated tissues compared to water-treated tissues . when b. cinerea-inoculated leaves were analyzed in more detail, gus expression was detected in cells surrounding b. cinerea-infected cells . most of these ppα-dox expressing cells also showed staining with the fluorescent dye solophenyl flavine 7gfe  <dig> , suggesting changes in the cell walls which could be indicative of cell wall reinforcement  <cit> . thus, ppα-dox expression and activity increased after b. cinerea infection and p.c. carotovorum elicitor treatments. in addition, ppα-dox is expressed in leaf cells surrounding b. cinerea-infected cells.figure  <dig>

effects of α-dox-derived oxylipins on moss development
since ppα-dox is highly expressed in apical protonemal cells which divide and give rise to typical moss colonies, we examined whether α-dox-derived oxylipins could alter colony morphology. small pieces of protonemal tissue of 1 mm were applied on medium containing 50 μm of α-dox products derived from linolenic acid , including 2-hydroxy- <dig> ,15-octadecatrienoic acid ,  <dig> ,14-heptadecatrienal  and 2-hot +17:3-al, and after 21 days the diameters of moss colonies were measured. the results revealed a reduction in the colony diameter of 33% and 50%, when tissues were grown with 17:3-al or 2-hot + 17:3-al, respectively, compared to control colonies . no clear difference in colony diameter was observed when only 2-hot was included in the medium . moss colonies grown in the presence of 17:3-al or 2-hot + 17:3-al had less protonemal tissue with less extending protonemal filaments compared to control colonies . to this end, we decided to generate ppα-dox overexpressing lines and knockout ppα-dox mutants by homologous recombination to analyze in more detail the possible role played by ppα-dox-derived oxylipins in moss development. after transformation one stable overexpressing line, pubi:ppα-dox- <dig>  with 51% increase in α-dox activity compared to wild-type plants was selected . since southern blot analysis revealed that the knockout lines obtained had multiple insertions of the construct , one knockout line  with null ppα-dox activity was selected. the ppα-dox-gus- <dig> line was included for further studies since ppα-dox was disrupted in this line, having only one insertion, and no α-dox activity . haploidy of all lines was confirmed by measurement of nuclear dna content . both knockout lines, ppα-dox- <dig> and ppα-dox-gus- <dig>  were phenotypically indistinguishable from each other and behave similarly in all our experiments and therefore only the data of ppα-dox- <dig> are shown. no morphological abnormalities during the juvenile or adult gametophytic phases were detected in ppα-dox- <dig> , indicating that ppα-dox is not required for morphogenesis. the general architecture of the leafy shoot was unaffected in pubi:ppα-dox- <dig> , and no alteration in sporophyte formation or spore viability was observed in the different genotypes compared to wild-type plants . however, moss colonies of the overexpressing pubi:ppα-dox- <dig> line were clearly smaller, with a reduction in colony diameter of 40% compared to wild-type colonies . overexpressing pubi:ppα-dox- <dig> colonies had less protonemal tissue with less extended protonemal filaments compared to wild-type colonies , similar to wild-type colonies grown in the presence of 17:3-al or 17:3-al + 2-hot . the main ppα-dox product measured in wild-type and overexpressing pubi:ppα-dox- <dig> tissues, when palmitic acid  is used as substrate, is the aldehyde pentadecanal  . this result together with the reduced colony diameter observed in wild-type colonies grown in the presence of the aldehyde 17:3-al, suggest that ppα-dox-derived aldehydes are probably the oxylipins responsible for reduced growth.figure  <dig>

effects of α-dox-derived oxylipins on protonemal development
protonemal tissue initially consists of chloronemal cells with characteristic perpendicular cross walls and a high density of chloroplasts. from chloronemal filaments caulonemal cells arise subsequently with oblique cross walls and low density of chloroplasts. in turn, branching of caulonemal cells give rise to new chloronemal cells developing secondary chloronemal filaments  <cit> . to further analyze the effect of oxylipins on protonemal growth, we looked in more detail at caulonemal and chloronemal filament growth in the different lines and compared it with wild-type tissues. since caulonemal filaments are responsible for radial growth  <cit> , and could therefore affect moss colony size, we induced caulonemal formation and measured length of the filaments. the result showed that the overexpressing pubi:ppα-dox- <dig> line has a significant reduction in the length of caulonemal filaments compared to wild-type plants , which correlate with the reduced protonemal filament extension observed in figure  <dig>  the knockout line ppα-dox- <dig> did not reveal any difference in caulonemal filament length compared to wild-type colonies . wild-type secondary chloronemal filaments growing from caulonema showed a typical branching pattern under normal growth conditions , while pubi:ppα-dox- <dig> developed altered branching with two or more secondary chloronemal cells arising from one caulonemal cell . protonemal tissues grown in the presence of 17:3-al or 2-hot + 17:3-al had only a few protruded caulonemal filaments, and most of the filaments were shorter compared to wild-type colonies , similar to what was observed at the border of pubi:ppα-dox- <dig> moss colonies . the sizes of chloronemal cells in wild-type, ppα-dox- <dig> and pubi:ppα-dox- <dig> tissues were also analyzed in chloronema inducing conditions . when a distribution of chloronemal cell sizes in groups was performed, pubi:ppα-dox- <dig> tissues had a higher proportion of cells with smaller sizes compared to wild-type and ppα-dox- <dig> cells . sizes of chloronemal cells were also evaluated in wild-type tissues grown under chloronema induction conditions in the presence of ppα-dox-derived oxylipins. we could observe a clear reduction in cell size of chloronemal cells, which corresponded to 41% and 48%, with 17:3-al and 2-hot + 17:3-al respectively, compared to control cells . chloronemal cell sizes of tissues grown with 2-hot were similar to control cells . in addition, some alterations in chloronemal cell division were observed when tissues were grown with 17:3-al and 2-hot + 17:3-al, as evidenced by the presence of cells with abnormal positioning of cross walls and filaments that did not have one typical apical cell . taken together, the results show that α-dox-derived oxylipins, principally the aldehydes, alter moss development by reducing protonemal tissues formation, due to less protruded caulonemal filaments, reduced caulonemal filaments length and reduced chloronemal cell size, which leads to decreased colony diameter. in addition, incubation of wild-type tissues with 17:3-al or a combination of 17:3-al and 2-hot leads to irregular chloronemal cell divisions.figure  <dig>

effect of ppα-dox-derived oxylipins on cell death caused by pectobacterium carotovorum elicitors
in order to analyze the possible role of ppα-dox in plant defense, cell death was measured by evans blue staining in wild-type, the knockout line ppα-dox- <dig> and the overexpressing line pubi:ppα-dox- <dig> after treating moss colonies for 1 day with elicitors of p.c. carotovorum and compared with water-treated colonies of the corresponding genotype. the results show that the knockout line ppα-dox- <dig> had similar cell death values after elicitor treatment compared to wild-type colonies, and both increased significantly compared to the corresponding water-treated colonies. in contrast, pubi:ppα-dox- <dig> showed less cell death which did not increase significantly compared to water-treated pubi:ppα-dox- <dig> colonies . to further analyze the protective effect of ppα-dox derived oxylipins against damage caused by elicitors of p.c. carotovorum, the increase in cell death after treating moss colonies for 1 day with these elicitors was analyzed in control plants  and compared with plants pre-treated for 1 day with 50 μm 2-hot, 50 μm 17:3-al or 50 μm 17:3-al + 50 μm 2-hot . the results show that while cell death caused by elicitors of p.c. carotovorum increased after pre-treating plant with ethanol, no significant increase in cell death could be observed when tissues were pre-treated with 2-hot, 17:3-al, or a combination of 17:3-al and 2-hot, suggesting that they protect tissues against cell damage caused by these elicitors.figure  <dig>

discussion
α-dioxygenases are present in primitive land plants
ppα-dox catalyzed the oxygenation of fatty acids to synthesize the same products as α-dox <dig> and α-dox <dig> from flowering plants, including the 2-hydroxy fatty acid and the corresponding one-carbon atom chain shortened aldehyde  <cit> . amino acid residues involved in heme binding , and the catalytic tyrosine  are conserved among flowering plant α-doxs and ppα-dox  <cit> . like atα-dox <dig>  recombinant ppα-dox has a substrate preference for linolenic, linoleic and palmitic acid  <cit> , while α-dox <dig> from tomato and a. thaliana have a broader substrate specificity  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis shows that ppα-dox belongs to the basal α-dioxygenase cluster along with its selaginella moellendorffii  <cit>  homologue, while flowering plant α-doxs form a separate clade with two independent clusters, one containing α-dox <dig> proteins and a second cluster containing α-dox <dig> proteins  <cit> . multicellular algae also have a putative α-dox, evidenced by the presence of 2-hydroxypalmitic acid in ulva pertusa  <cit> . sequence data placed a putative α-dox of the multicellular algae volvox carteri in a unique cluster separated from plant α-dioxygenases. no putative α-dox gene could be found in the unicellular green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii, suggesting that α-dox proteins originated in multicellular algae. while more primitive land plants, including p. patens and selaginella moellendorffii, have only one encoding α-dox gene, most flowering plants have more than one α-dox gene, which have probably specialized and acquired distinct biological functions during plant evolution.

ppα-dox is highly expressed in mitotically active undifferentiated apical protonemal cells and in auxin producing differentiated gametophore cells
ppα-dox-gus fusion proteins accumulate in tips of protonemal filaments and rhizoids, where the highest expression occurs in apical cells. these apical cells function as stem cells and divide continuously, producing a new apical stem cell and a differentiated subapical cell, allowing moss to grow by tip growth  <cit> . ppα-dox-gus expression was also observed in other types of mitotically active cells, including dividing cells from detached leaves that readily reprogram, reenter the cell cycle and change their cell fate to become chloronemal apical stem cells  <cit> , which also accumulate ppα-dox. distal protonemal cells from regenerating protoplasts also expressed ppα-dox, with maximum gus accumulation in apical cells. thus, ppα-dox is highly expressed in mitotically active cells, suggesting that the oxylipins produced could play a role in undifferentiated protonemal apical cells and are less important in protonemal cells that have stopped dividing or have acquired cell fate.

ppα-dox expression is induced in leaves and cauloids of gametohpores after auxin application and ppα-dox-gus accumulation at the basal and the apical part of the gametophore cauloid correlated with the two main locations of auxin occurrence which are sites of high levels of cell division  <cit> . consistently, ppα-dox-gus expression pattern in rhizoids and axillary hairs coincided with ppshi2-gus accumulation in gametophores of reporter lines which detect sites of auxin synthesis  <cit> , and is similar to pgmgh3-gus reporter lines which detect sites of auxin activity and response  <cit> . expression of ppshi <dig>  which is a positive regulator of auxin biosynthesis, is detected only along the whole caulonema independent of the age, position or mitotic activity of the cells  <cit> . in addition, aoyama et al.  <cit>  have proposed the existence of a local loss of auxin in protonemal apical cells that might serve as a cue during cell fate determination. these findings suggest that additional signal in protonemal cells, particularly in apical cells, contribute to ppα-dox expression.

α-dox-derived aldehydes induce alterations in differentiated cells of protonemal filaments
ppα-dox knockout mutants did not show any apparent developmental phenotype in the gametophyte compared to wild-type plants, suggesting that ppα-dox is not required for correct tip growth and morphogenesis in p. patens. knocking-out α-dox <dig> in flowering plants may or may not have an effect on development depending on the plant species  <cit> . while a. thaliana α-dox <dig> mutant has no developmental alterations, tomato α-dox <dig> mutant and n. attenuata co-suppressed α-dox <dig> and α-dox <dig> plants have a stunted phenotype  <cit> . interestingly, moss colonies of the overexpressing pubi:ppα-dox- <dig> line, with significantly higher ppα-dox activity compared to wild-type plants, and moss colonies of wild-type tissues grown in the presence of ppα-dox-derived oxylipins, principally 17:3-al, are smaller and have less protonemal tissues. this morphological effect is due to less protruded caulonemal filaments, reduced caulonemal filaments length and a higher proportion of chloronemal cells with reduced size. since 17:3-al reduces protonemal growth, and aldehydes are the main ppα-dox-derived oxylipins accumulating in moss tissues, we consider that overexpressing lines with higher α-dox activity than pubi:ppα-dox- <dig> are difficult to select due to their small size compared to other transformants with less α-dox activity. thus, to ensure a proper development of wild-type moss tissues, ppα-dox production and/or activity are probably tightly regulated.

in p. patens, other oxylipins including jasmonates and opda also reduce colony size  <cit> , although the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unknown. in flowering plants jasmonates and opda arrest root growth and retard seedling growth  <cit> . these oxylipins can inhibit cell division by preventing cell cycle progression  <cit> , and repressing mitosis-phase genes  <cit> . jasmonate has a negative effect on a. thaliana leaf growth by reducing cell number and cell size, associated to reduced expression of the cell cycle regulator cyclin-dependent protein kinase cycb1; <dig>  <cit> . jasmonate also inhibits a. thaliana root length by reducing both cell number and cell length, involving differentiation of columella stem cell in the root meristem and irregular division of quiescent cells which are mitotically inactive  <cit> . in p. patens we observed an expression pattern for ppα-dox-gus proteins with high expression in undifferentiated mitotically active protonemal apical cells, lower expression levels in differentiated subapical cells and no expression in the remaining older proximate differentiated protonemal cells. constitutive production or higher than normal levels of ppα-dox-derived oxylipins, principally 17:3-al, in differentiated protonemal cells lead probably to reduced cell size and irregular divisions of these mitotically inactive cells. ppα-dox-derived oxylipins could also promote cell differentiation since ppα-dox-gus proteins accumulate in reprogrammed cells of detached leaves which have reentered the cell cycle, divided and changed their cell fate to produce chloronema apical cells  <cit> . thus, ppα-dox could contribute directly or indirectly to the fine-tuning of cell proliferation and differentiation in p. patens.

α-dox-derived oxylipins protect moss tissues against cellular damage caused by elicitors of p.c. carotovorum
α-dox <dig> of flowering plants are induced after pathogen infection and herbivore attack and play a role in the defense response against this type of stress  <cit> . in this work, we show that transcript levels and ppα-dox activity increase after treatment with elicitors of p.c. carotovorum and spores of b. cinerea, both of which induce a hypersensitive response  in flowering plants and p. patens  <cit> . similarly, in a. thaliana and n. tabacum, transcriptional up-regulation of α-dox <dig> is higher when plants are infected with pseudomonas strains that induce an hr response  <cit> . under normal conditions, ppα-dox accumulates in tips of protonemal filaments and rhizoids, which are the cells that are probably more exposed to soil-borne pathogen infection and might represent, together with other defense mechanisms, a permanent system of protection. ppα-dox is also expressed in axillary hairs, which in some moss species secrete a mucilage  <cit> , that may protect young leaves from desiccation  <cit> , and could also have a function in defense responses against pathogens. ppα-dox expression increases in protonemal tissues and leaves treated with elicitors of the harpin producing p.c. carotovorum strain or infected with b. cinerea. interestingly, the ppα-dox-gus accumulation pattern in cells surrounding b. cinerea infected cells in p. patens leaves was similar to a. thaliana α-dox <dig> expression in leaves where gus accumulated in cells surrounding tissues infected with a virulent p. syringae strain  <cit> . a possible role in protecting plant tissues against oxidative stress and cell death generated by pathogens is proposed for a. thaliana α-dox <dig>  <cit> , and ppα-dox could play similar functions in moss. recently, garcía-marcos et al.  <cit>  have demonstrated that α-dox <dig> from n. benthamiana positively regulates programmed cell death during infections with different viruses. while a. thaliana α-dox <dig> is essential for an efficient defense response against pathogens  <cit> , ppα-dox is not required and similar damage is caused by b. cinerea or elicitors of p.c. carotovorum in the knockout lines compared to wild-type plants. however, overexpression of ppα-dox and treatments with α-dox-derived oxylipins lead to less cellular damage caused by elicitors of p.c. carotovoum, which contains cell wall degrading enzymes and the hr inducing harpin protein  <cit> . consistently, a. thaliana plants overproducing α-dox <dig> showed less cellular damage to p. syringae infection  <cit> , and a reduction in the severity of the symptoms against this bacteria was evidenced when tobacco plants were pre-treated with 2-hot  <cit> , or when a. thaliana plants were pre-treated with 17:3-al or 2-hot  <cit> . the mechanisms by which plant α-dox-derived oxylipins protect plant tissues against pathogen infection are poorly understood. recently, shimada et al.  <cit>  have demonstrated that after pathogen infection α-dox <dig> and a caleosin  from a. thaliana are recruited to oil bodies of areas surrounding the site of infection. interestingly, atα-dox <dig> and atclo <dig> together favored the production of the stable oxylipin 2-hot, which has anti-fungal activity against members of the genus colletotrichum  <cit> . in addition, α-dox-derived oxylipins could also play a role in the activation of genes encoding proteins involved in hormonal signaling  <cit> , oxidative stress scavenging, cell death protection and/or inducing protein with antimicrobial activities.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we show that the unique α-dox gene of the moss p. patens shares both functions of flowering plants α-dox <dig> and α-dox <dig> and participates in development and in the defense response. thus, α-dox from flowering plants could have originated by duplication and successive functional diversification after the divergence from bryophytes. although ppα-dox is not crucial for development and defense against elicitors of p.c. carotovorum, higher than normal levels of oxylipins result in protonema developmental alterations, suggesting that oxylipin production is tightly regulated. ppα-dox expression patterns together with phenotypic analysis also suggest that the derived oxylipins could participate directly or indirectly in cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as in protecting moss tissues damaged by cell wall degrading enzymes and harpin of p.c. carotovorum. here, we have modified for the first time the levels of α-dox-derived oxylipins in the plant p. patens, providing new tools for the understanding of the role played by α-dox in development and the adaptation of plants to their environment.
