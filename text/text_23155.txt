BACKGROUND
predicting subcellular location of proteins is one of the major problems in bioinformatics. this is a problem of predicting which part  in a cell a given protein is transported to, where an amino acid sequence  of the protein is given as an input as shown in fig.  <dig>  this problem is becoming more important since information on subcellular location is helpful for annotation of proteins and genes and the number of complete genomes is rapidly increasing. many methods have been proposed using various computational techniques. furthermore, many web-based prediction systems have been developed based on these proposed methods.

psort  <cit>  is historically the first subcellular location predictor. psort and its major extension, such as wolf psort  <cit> , use various sequence-derived features such as the presence of sequence motifs and amino acid compositions. although there are many predicting methods, they can be roughly classified into two groups. one is the n-terminal based method and the other is based on amino acid composition. targetp  <cit>  requires the n-terminal sequence as an input into two layers of artificial neural networks , utilizing the earlier binary predictors, signalp  <cit>  and chlorop  <cit> . reczko and hatzigeorgiou used a bidirectional recurrent neural network with the first  <dig> residues in the n-terminal sequence  <cit> .

cedano et al. developed protlock  <cit> , which is based on the amino acid composition and the least mahalanobis distance algorithm. chou and elrod used the covariant discriminant algorithm besides amino acid composition  <cit> . nnpsl  <cit>  is an ann-based method using the amino acid composition by reinhardt and hubbard. after the successful report by reinhardt and hubbard  <cit> , application of machine learning techniques became popular in this field. a support vector machine  was implemented for subloc  <cit>  instead of the ann. incorporating amino acid order as well as amino acid composition is expected to make it possible to improve prediction performance. the pseudo-amino acid composition was proposed by chou  <cit>  in order to deal with the effect of the amino acid order. moreover, cai and chou  <cit>  have recently developed an accurate method integrating the pseudo-amino acid composition, the gene ontology information  <cit> , and the functional domain composition  <cit> . park and kanehisa  <cit>  developed an efficient method that incorporates compositions of dipeptides and gapped amino acid pairs besides the conventional amino acid composition. yu et al. <cit>  successfully predicted localizations for gram-negative bacteria by multiple feature vectors  <cit>  based on n-peptide compositions. the concepts of the pseudo-amino acid and gapped amino acid pair compositions were merged in the residue-couple model proposed by  <cit> . nair and rost introduced loctree and showed mimicking the mechanism of cellular sorting yields good accuracies  <cit> .

recently, matsuda et al. <cit>  proposed a novel representation of protein sequences. that representation involves local amino acid compositions and twin amino acids, and local frequencies of distance between successive  amino acids. each sequence is split into three parts: n-terminal, middle, and c-terminal in order to calculate the local features. the n-terminal part is further divided into four regions for considering ambiguity in the length and position of signal sequences. it was combined with svm for prediction of subcellular location of proteins. the results of computational experiments suggest that their method is one of the state-of-the-art methods. though the prediction accuracy is high, the method is based on various heuristics. furthermore, many of the heuristics are specific to the protein subcellular location problem. in this paper, we try to develop a less heuristic method for the protein subcellular location problem and improve the prediction accuracies. our method does not use any knowledge of motifs, gene ontologies and other databases. furthermore, feature vector is very simple, that is amino acid composition of  <dig> elements. development of such a method is important since it may be applied to other problems in bioinformatics. for example, the spectrum kernel  <cit> , which is a simple and general kernel function for svm, has been applied to various problems including remote homology detection  <cit> , recognition of dna-binding proteins  <cit> , prediction of protein-protein interactions  <cit>  and prediction of protein subcellular location.

to develop a general and more accurate method, we combine two-techniques in a simple but novel and general way: sequence alignment and a feature vector based on amino acid composition. although there are predictors  which combine sequence similarity and svm based method, alignment is applied directly to amino acid sequences. on the other hand, in our method as explained later, alignment is applied to block sequences, in which each block has an amino acid composition-based feature vector. furthermore, although there are some predictors which utilize sequence similarity and amino acid compositions , their method is a kind of hybrid procedure. that is, if sequence alignment can identify some homologous sequence, the prediction by sequence alignment is used. otherwise, the prediction by svm based method is used. therefore, in their method, sequence alignment and svm based method are independently executed. however, in our method, results of alignment are used as elements of kernel matrix.

it should be noted that amino acid composition-based feature vector is almost the same as spectrum kernel. elements of our proposed kernel matrix are scores of alignment between sequences of substrings of proteins. the alignment scores are calculated in accordance with amino acid composition-based feature vectors as shown in fig.  <dig> . as a result, we succeeded in improving prediction accuracies of the protein subcellular location problem for plant. to evaluate the prediction accuracies, we extracted plant data sets from targetp data base and compared our method with existing methods through fivefold cross validation tests. although our prediction method is less specialized for localization prediction than existing predictors, the overall accuracy and average mcc, which are standard measures of prediction accuracy, are  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. they are higher than existing predictors which use only sequence information. furthermore, our method for plant is implemented as a web-system and available on  <cit> .

since the datasets obtained from targetp is not very new, we also applied our method to plant datasets included in wolf psort package version  <dig>  that can be downloaded from  <cit> . as a result the overall accuracy of  <dig>  was obtained and this value is higher than that of wolf psort.

RESULTS
note: parameters of table  <dig> are used in our method.

it is to be noted that our overall accuracy and average mcc are higher than any other predictor in table  <dig>  furthermore, our mcc for each location is higher than that of any other predictor. thus, it can be said that the prediction accuracy of our method is higher than existing predictors which use only sequence information.

since data sets of targetp are not very new, we also applied our method to plant data sets of wolf psort, which are included in wolf psort package version  <dig>  and can be downloaded from  <cit> . we removed  <dig> proteins which have dual locations from original  <dig> proteins. as a result, obtained average mcc and overall accuracy were  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. although we have not implemented for data sets which include dual location proteins, our overall accuracy would still be  <dig>  even if our method predicted a false location for every dual location protein. since the overall accuracy of wolf psort is  <dig> , it seems that our method is also efficient for relatively new data sets. details are shown in table  <dig>  furthermore, we also applied our method to targetp non-plant data sets. details are shown in table  <dig>  obtained average mcc and overall accuracy are  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. although these values are slightly worse than those of matsuda et al.  <cit> , these are better than the other predictors of table  <dig>  our mcc for mtp and "other" are worse than  <cit>  by  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively although our mcc for sp is slightly better than  <cit> .

note: in our method, although gap penalty =  <dig> , γ =  <dig> , c =  <dig>  w =  <dig> are given, posconstraint and negconstraint are not specified.

note: in our method, although gap penalty =  <dig> , γ =  <dig> , c =  <dig>  w =  <dig> are given, posconstraint and negconstraint are not specified.

control experiments
we executed some control experiments in order to evaluate the results of our method. table  <dig> shows the comparison of our methods which use following feature vectors:  amino acid composition  all adjacent amino acid composition  amino acid composition and twin amino acid composition. "twin amino acid composition" is defined as the frequency of length two substrings "xx" for any amino acid x. for example, if an amino acid sequence "aaacc" is given, aa =  <dig> , cc =  <dig>  and the others =  <dig> are obtained. as a result,  yielded the best result,  <dig> % of overall accuracy. overall accuracy of  and  were  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. although twin amino acids were effective for the method of matsuda et al. <cit> , they did not improve the overall accuracy of our method.

note: parameters of table  <dig> are used for all methods.

we also implemented the nearest neighbor classifier  with the similarity measure proposed in this manuscript. the obtained average mcc and overall accuracy were  <dig>  and  <dig> . these values are worse than the svm based method by  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. therefore, in the control experiment where the same similarity measure  and different classifiers  are used, svm was better than nnc. details are shown in the first and third methods of table  <dig> 

note: in the first method, all parameters of table  <dig> are given. in the second and third methods, gap penalty =  <dig> , γ =  <dig> , c =  <dig>  w =  <dig> are given although posconstraint and negconstraint are not specified.

furthermore, according to matsuda et al. , the overall accuracy of nnc with smith-waterman score is  <dig>  %. therefore, in the control experiment where the different similarity measures  and the same classifier  are used, our proposed similarity measure was better than smith-waterman score by  <dig> .

mitopred  <cit>  is a web server which enables prediction of nucleus encoded mitochondrial proteins in all eukaryotic species. we input plant proteins of targetp into mitopred and compared the accuracies with our method. table  <dig> shows the comparison of our method and mitopred of each confidence cutoff. when confidence cutoff is 60%, mitopred yielded its best mcc of  <dig> . however, our mcc is  <dig>  and higher than that of mitopred by  <dig> .

note: parameters of table  <dig> are used for our method.

furthermore, mitpred is a web-server specifically trained to predict the proteins which are destined to localized in mitochondria in yeast and animals  <cit> . we applied mitpred to both plant and nonplant proteins of targetp. mitpred has three types of methods; svm method, blast+svm method and hmm+svm method. for both plant and nonplant datasets, blast+svm method yielded the better mcc than any other method of mitpred. for plant dataset, mcc of blast+svm method of mitpred was  <dig> , which is less than mcc of our method by  <dig> . on the other hand, for nonplant dataset, mcc of blast+svm method of mitpred was  <dig> , which is better than mcc of our method by  <dig> . since mitpred is specifically trained to predict the mitochondrial proteins in yeast and animals, the accuracy for nonplant mtp is better than ours. however, our accuracy is better than that of mitpred for plant although our prediction method is not specialized to mtp. table  <dig> shows the detailed comparison of our method and mitpred.

note: in our methods, parameters shown in table  <dig> of the manuscript were used, but "posconstraint" and "negconstraint" were not specified for nonplant mtp. for mitpred, we used default parameters as follows. in svm method, threshold was set as  <dig> . e-value cutoff of blast+svm method was 1e- <dig>  e-value and svm threshold for hmm based pfam search+svm method were 1e- <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

by utilizing blastclust, we obtained non-redundant dataset at 70% and 25% from targetp plant data set. table  <dig> shows numbers of sequences for each location. by applying our svm based method to these data sets, overall accuracy of  <dig>  and  <dig>  were obtained respectively. therefore, it can be said that our method is efficient even when sequence similarity is relatively small. details are shown in table  <dig> 

note: parameters of table  <dig> are used for all methods.

discussion
we proposed a novel subcellular location predicting method which is based on sequence alignment and amino acid composition. through fivefold cross validation tests for targetp plant data sets, we obtained the overall accuracy of  <dig>  and the average mcc of  <dig> . these values are higher than existing predictors which use only sequence information. we believe that the high accuracy attained by our method indicates that our alignment algorithm is automatically detecting signal sequences. localization signals, such as the mitochondrial transit signal are highly diverse at the amino acid level, but share some features such as regions of positive charge or amphiphilic nature. thus by aligning the amino acid compositions of small blocks, instead of individual amino acids, our technique may capture some features of localization signals such as transit signals.

as mentioned in the previous section, our method is effective for "ctp", "mtp" and "sp," but less effective for "other". the reason is discussed in the following. in general, proteins destined for chloroplast, mitochondria, and secretory pathway have signal sequences in their n termini. on the other hand, proteins destined for nucleus and cytosol have one or more signal sequences in the middle part of their sequence. as explained later, global alignment is applied to left ends of sequences and local alignment is applied to right ends of sequences in our method as shown in fig.  <dig>  then, it detects signal sequences in n termini with higher probability than in the middle part of sequences. this is the reason why our method cannot improve the accuracy for "other" substantially. furthermore, conventional local alignment, in which local alignment is applied to both ends of sequences, did not improve the prediction accuracy in our preliminary experiment. this fact is reasonable since conventional local alignment ignores signal sequences in n-termini with higher probability than our method.

although the above discussion can also be applied to sp and the "other" subset of non-plant datasets of targetp, the result for non-plant mtp seems to be contradicting to this. we think the reason is either due to the influence of not using distance frequency  <cit> , or that the composition of non-plant mtp sequences is only  <dig> %. alternatively, there may exist some unknown signal sequences relating to subcellular location in n-termini of non-plant mtp proteins. however, it should be noted that the difference of accuracies between our method and  <cit>  is very small .

parameters in table  <dig> were determined by trial and error approach, because it is very important to assign appropriate values to them. since our feature vector consists of only amino acid composition, the information of subcellular location signals may be disappeared if w is too large or too small. even when appropriate w is given, the information of signals may be divided and ignored if the edge of the window is in the middle of a signal sequence. however, such ignored signals can be found if c is set appropriately. c = w/ <dig> is considered to be one of the best relationships between c and w.

assigning appropriate values to γ and gap penalty is also important. as explained later, the pairing score in alignment of our method takes a positive value when two blocks are similar to each other. on the other hand, the pairing score takes a negative value when two blocks are not similar. however, if γ is too large, the pairing score takes a negative value in most cases. on the other hand, if γ is too small, the pairing score takes a positive value in most cases. therefore, it is very important to set appropriate γ since it determines the threshold of "whether blocks are similar to each other". the value of gap penalty also strongly influences the result of alignment. the detailed method of determining these parameters are described in the following.

let p represent the gap penalty. we examined p =  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> , γ =  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  = , ,  respectively. among values above,  =  yielded the best accuracy. since we did not examine so many values, the accuracy may be improved by further optimization for these values. we believe that further optimization for  is more hopeful than those for p and γ to improve the accuracy. it is to be noted that the same values were used for  in all the experiments in this paper.

in terms of "posconstraint" and "negconstraint", the first and second methods of table  <dig> show the comparison of

•  our method with specifying "posconstraint" and "negconstraint,"

•  our method without specifying "posconstraint" and "negconstraint."

although the average mcc and overall accuracy of  are better than those of  by  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively,  is better than the other predictors shown in table  <dig>  in terms of sp, mcc of  is better than  by  <dig>  although  is better than  for the other locations. thus, our predictor can yield good accuracies even when "posconstraint" and "negconstraint" are not specified.

to optimize these parameters used in , we set posconstraint = exp and negconstraint = exp and scanned i and j from  <dig> to  <dig>  then, values which yielded the best overall accuracy were used for  and are shown in table  <dig>  we believe that further optimization for "posconstraint" and "negconstraint" does not substantially improve the accuracies.

we also developed a web-based prediction system based on our proposed method for plant. it is available on  <cit> . when amino acid sequences in the fasta format are given as shown in fig.  <dig>  the web-system returns the first and second candidates of the location and their scores as shown in fig.  <dig>  although an overall accuracy of  <dig> % was achieved in our five-fold cross validation tests, it takes about  <dig> seconds to predict a location. the reason why our web-system is not fast is that it calculates similarity scores between every input sequence and all training sequences. however, these calculations can be parallelized. if there are enough cpus, the calculation time would be in a second although our web-system is not parallelized so far.

CONCLUSIONS
our overall accuracy, average mcc and mcc for each location are higher than any other predictor which use sequence information for plant proteins of targetp. furthermore, our overall accuracy for plant proteins of wolf psort is higher than wolf psort although used datasets are slightly different. therefore, it can be said that our prediction method for plant is efficient and succeeded in improving accuracies of existing methods. although it is known that the overall accuracies  of the predictor for plant by chou and cai  <cit>  are slightly higher than those of our predictor, their method uses the information of gene ontology and functional domain. since such information can be obtained only for known proteins, it is still important to develop a predictor which use only sequence information of amino acids. thus, our predictor is considered to be useful for subcellular location prediction of newly-discovered proteins. furthermore, the idea of combination of alignment and amino acid frequency is novel and general so that it may be applied to other problems in bioinformatics. although our web-based predictor is now available for only plant, constructing the system for non-plant and plant which includes more numbers of subcellular locations is our on-going work.
