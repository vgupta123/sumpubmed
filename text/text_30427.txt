BACKGROUND
environmental stresses including salinity, extreme temperatures, limited water availability, and fungal pathogens deeply limit agricultural productivity. alleviating these problems and ensuring sustainable agricultural development is a priority for plant biologists. during their evolution, plants have acquired a complex defense system to responsd to adverse environmental conditions. the mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascades, which are composed of three groups of protein kinases: mapkk kinases , mapk kinase  and mapk/mpks, are conserved in eukaryotes through evolution and operate as sequential signal transducers via phosphorylation to amplify, channel and integrate information from the cellular environment to the transcriptional response and metabolic response centers  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, there are  <dig> mapkkk,  <dig> mkk and  <dig> mpk genes  <cit> . the ten mkk genes in arabidopsis may activate different mpks and hence may integrate cross-talk of different signaling pathways. mkks can be classified into four major groups  based on their s/txxxxxs/t consensus domain and “d sites”  <cit> . atmkk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> have been reported to play roles in plant stress responses  <cit> . the mpk families also have four major groups  based on their conserved t-d/e -y motif with groups a, b, c harboring t-e-y while group d has t-d-y motif  <cit> . arabidopsis mpk <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  which are in group a and b respectively, are involved in many diverse processes including developmental processes and stress responses  <cit> .

wrky transcription factors  are important transcriptional regulators that modulate immune responses and abiotic stresses  <cit> . emerging evidence demonstrates that group i wrky transcription factors, which contain a conserved sp cluster and/or d domain motif in their n-terminal regions, could be activated by mapk-dependent phosphorylation, suggesting post-translational regulation of wrky transcription factors  <cit> . so far, several mapkkk-mkk-mpk and mpk-wrky modules and their functions have been well-studied. for instance, arabidopsis mpk <dig> is phosphorylated by upstream mkk1/ <dig> and mekk <dig> and, once phosphorylated, it phosphorylates and activates map kinase  <dig> substrate  <dig> , which then triggers the dissociation of the inactivated form of mpk4-mks1-wrky <dig> to release mks1-wrky <dig>  <cit>  the released mks1-wrky <dig> can then enter the nucleus to initiate the transcription of downstream phytoalexin deficient <dig> , required for the antimicrobial camalexin production  <cit> . on the other hand, atmpk <dig> and - <dig> are activated by upstream mkk <dig> and - <dig> to phosphorylate wrky <dig> and, through transcriptional regulation of the camalexin biosynthetic genes pad <dig> and pad <dig>  confer resistance to fungal pathogens  <cit> . a more recent report provided direct evidence that atwrky <dig> is phosphorylated by atmpk <dig> and atmpk <dig> in vivo in responses to botrytis cinerea infection  <cit> , suggesting that phosphorylation of wrky transcription factors by mpks could be an important means to transduce the signal to nuclei.

expression of a constitutively active atmpk <dig>  reduced sa accumulation and defense resistance against bacteria pseudomonas syringae pv tomato strain dc <dig>   <cit> . moreover, pathogen-associated molecular pattern -triggered reactive oxygen species  were also repressed in ca-mpk <dig> plants, which is different from the effects regulated by either mpk <dig> or the loss-of-function mpk <dig> mutant  <cit> . arabidopsis mek1-mpk <dig> was also involved in abscisic acid  and sugar signaling in the process of seed germination, as the induction of nced <dig> and aba <dig> by sugar was abolished in the double mutant mek1/mpk <dig> <cit> . atmpk3/6-atwrky <dig> regulates 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase  activity, a rate-limiting step in ethylene biosynthesis pathway, at both transcriptional and protein stability levels in plant immune responses to b. cinerea <cit> . atmpk <dig> and - <dig> are also involved in stomatal dynamics and development  <cit> . stomatal closure caused by drought and other stresses is mediated by the phytohormone aba and h2o <dig> and, this process also requires the participation of the atmkk <dig> and atmpk <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> . atmkk <dig> could act upstream of group c mpks  to regulate the downstream pathogenesis-related  genes since propr1::gus expression was enhanced by the co-expression of atmkk3/atmpk <dig>  atmkk3-overexpression lines with increased pr gene expression are tolerant while the knock-out mkk <dig> lines are susceptible to pst dc <dig> <cit> .

mapk signaling cascades have also been reported to play important roles in other plant species. a mapk from rice , bwmk <dig>  can phosphorylate a transcription factor, oserebp <dig>  and overexpressing bwmk <dig> in tobacco enhanced expression of many pathogenesis-related genes with enhanced resistance to pathogens  <cit> . osmapk <dig> is induced by various biotic  and abiotic  stresses; however, overexpression or rnai-mediated suppression demonstrated that osmapk <dig> can positively regulate drought, salt, and cold tolerance while negatively modulating pr gene expression and resistance to fungal  and bacterial  pathogens  <cit> . a more recent report shows that osmkk <dig> phosphorylates osmpk <dig> and these constitute a moderately  but not a severely  low temperature signalling pathway  <cit> . in nicotiana benthamiana and nicotiana tabacum, sa-induced protein kinase  and wound-induced protein kinase  are well-known to be involved into osmotic stress, wounding, and biotic stress  <cit> . in zea mays, zmmpk <dig> and - <dig> are reported to participate in the plant response to cold, drought, ultraviolet light and oxidative stress  <cit> . in triticum aestivum, tampk <dig> and - <dig> are differentially regulated at multiple levels during compatible disease interactions with mycosphaerella graminicola <cit> . in solanum lycopersicum , lempk <dig> and lempk <dig> were activated in response to systemin, four different oligosaccharide elicitors , and uv-b radiation  <cit> . in medicago sativa, simk, mmk <dig>  mmk <dig>  and samk were activated by excess copper or cadmium ions. furthermore, simk is also activated by simk kinase . however, there are still many unknown mapkkk-mkk-mpk modules waiting to be identified and characterized  <cit> . so far, no systematic investigations of mapkk/mkk and mapk/mpk gene families have been reported in brassica napus.

canola  is a major oil crop in temperate regions and its quality and quantity are often limited by adverse environmental stresses including fungal pathogens. the fungal disease sclerotinia stem rot, caused by s. sclerotiorum  de bary, is a particular problem in canola  <cit> . due to the lack of resistant germplasm, and the fact that the resistance is possibly mediated by multiple genes, it is necessary to identify and explore the genes that contribute to plant resistance against s. sclerotiorum <cit> . in our previous transcriptional study of canola infected with s. sclerotiorum, we identified several wrky genes and mpk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> as well as several mkk and mapkkk genes that are responsive to s. sclerotiorum infection  <cit> . further, from canola, we identified  <dig> and cloned  <dig> wrky genes and studied them  <cit> . however the biological significance and functions of most of the canola mkk and mpk genes, except mpk <dig>  have not been described so far in b. napus <cit> . in the present study, we describe the identification and cloning of seven bnamkk and  <dig> bnampk genes and, analyze them using bioinformatics and molecular and biochemical assays. we found that some of the bnamkk and bnampk genes are responsive to multiple stress treatments including s. sclerotiorum, oxalic acids , drought, etc. through yeast two-hybrid  assay, both bnamkk-bnampk and bnampk-bnawrky interactions were screened and several interesting mapk modules were identified. finally, comparison of expression patterns of putative orthologs from canola and arabidopsis showed that they may be involved in different signalling pathways. through this work, we can better understand the biotic  and abiotic stress responses as well as the molecular mechanisms regualted by mkk-mpk-wrky modules in canola. the data presented here would also lay a solid foundation for improving the tolerance of canola against s. sclerotiorum and other abiotic stresses through modulating the expression level of these genes.

RESULTS
identification, cloning of bnamkk and bnampk genes in canola
as the first step to understand the roles of mkk and mpk signaling cascades in canola response to abiotic and biotic stresses, we aimed to clone bnamkk and bnampk genes from canola. since the sequencing of brassica napus genome is not finished and arabidopsis is a close relative to b. napus, we used the sequences of  <dig> mkk genes and  <dig> mpk genes of arabidopsis as queries, and ran blast searches of the expressed sequence tag  database  of b. napus in ncbi. as a result, we identified  <dig> ests representing mpks and  <dig> ests for mkks , which showed significant similarities with an e-value lower than 10- <dig>  these ests were manually curated and then assembled to obtain contigs and singlets, which were then reciprocally blast searched against the arabidopsis transcript database, tair <dig>  to identify the putative orthologs. the names of canola mkk and mpk genes were assigned based on names of their presumptive arabidopsis orthologs. afterwards, the amino acids of each contig or singlet were predicted using dnaman or dnastar program. as a result, we successfully identified ests representing  <dig> bnamkk and  <dig> bnampk genes . to facilatate the characterization of these two gene families, we named each gene with a three-letter code starting with bna  followed the family designation , and finally a number consistent with the arabidopsis mapk and mapkk nomenclature .

athe full-length cdna was cloned and deposited in genbank. no, cloning not sucessful.

bputative orthologs were identified by inparanoid  with a maximum score. n/a, homolog but not ortholog was identified.

csubcellular localizations are predicted using three different programs, one is psort , the second is cello v <dig>   and the third is eslpred . nuc-nuclear, cyt-cytoplasm,pp-perplasm, mit-mitochondria,chl-chloroplast,and pm-plasma membrane.

we used rt-pcr and race  to clone the cdna sequences of the bnamkk and bnampk genes using high-fidelity polymerase. as a result, seven bnamkk and  <dig> bnampk genes were cloned and the sequences were deposited in the genbank . orthologs from different species may have similar biological functions  <cit> . because functions of some mkk and mpk genes in the model plants arabidopsis and rice have been well studied, we compared our cloned bnamkk and bnampk sequences to those of arabidopsis and rice and identified presumed orthologs in each species .

phylogenetic analysis, multiple alignment and domain analysis of bnamkks and bnampks
to better understand the evolutionary history of both mkk and mpk gene families, we also retrieved mkk and mpk gene sequences from a variety of species representing major land plant lineages including the bryophyte physcomitrella patens , the lycophyte selaginella moellendorffii , and several mono- and eudicotyledonous angiosperms, namely: the eudicots arabidopsis thaliana , vitis vinifera , populus trichocarpa  and glycine max ; and the monocots oryza sativa , sorghum bicolor , brachypodium distachyon , and zea mays . by searching the green alga chlamydomonas reinhartdii  genome in phytozome v <dig> , we also identified two mkk genes, whose protein sequences showed great similarity to atmkk <dig> and atmkk <dig>  respectively . furthermore, we also identified an mkk gene from a marine green alga ostreococcus tauri , which is the world’s smallest free-living eukaryote known to date  <cit> . it should be noted that based on evidence from ests, the size of the canola mkk protein family is roughly comparable to that of either arabidopsis, rice or poplar, although not all mkk genes have been cloned from canola. on the other hand, the green alga c. reinhartdii and lower land plants p. patens and s. moellendorffii apparently evolved a smaller set of mkks relative to the flowering plants, which indicates an expansion of mkk gene family after the divergence of flowering plants from the other lineages.

the amino acid sequences of mkks collected from  <dig> species, together with our bnamkk sequences, were used to construct a phylogenetic tree using the maximum parsimony  method . the otmkk was used to root the tree. as shown by the tree’s topology, the mkk proteins from various species could be divided into four major groups, each supported by highly significant bootstrap values. the seven canola mkks were distributed in each of the four groups, with bnamkk <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> belonging to group a, bnamkk <dig> group b, bnamkk <dig> and - <dig> group c, and bnamkk <dig> group d , which is consistent with previous phylogenetic analysis of mkks from arabidopsis, rice and poplar  <cit> . furthermore, the seven bnamkk members were always clustered in the same subgroup closely with atmkk orthologs, which was expected for genes from these two representatives of the brassicaceae family. the multiple alignment of the collected bnamkks showed that they each have a putative mpk docking sites  at the n terminus, characterized by a cluster of basic residues  n-terminal to hydrophobic residues  , as reported for the mkks from model species  <cit> . these bnamkk proteins also contain a highly conserved phosphorylation site, which has a consensus sequence s/txxxxxs/t, as previously identified in arabidopsis mkk proteins .

the conserved motifs among the bnamkks were further analyzed using the meme <dig> program, and a schematic of the motifs is presented . seven motifs were conserved in all bnamkks identified, while motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were group-specific. group a  has motif  <dig> in the n-terminal sequence especially, while only group c  and d  had motif  <dig>  bnamkk <dig> had an extra motif  <dig> in the c terminal region. in addition, we found that bnamkk <dig> had a long c-terminal region and a similar observation was also made with bdmkk <dig>  <cit> . the motifs from meme analysis were further annotated by comparisons with known protein kinase motifs/domains . we noted that motif  <dig> contained both iihrdlkpsnllv, which is the active-site signature of serine/threonine protein kinases, and s/txxxxs/t, which is the consensus sequence  <cit> . motif  <dig> contains protein kinases atp-binding signature, igkgssgvvqlvqhkwtgqf, in which a glycine-rich loop  is required for atp binding. motif  <dig>  is the conserved signature in the catalytic domains as described previously  <cit> .

to further explore the evolutionary history of the mapk family in plants, we retrieved mpk sequences from a various plant species . we identified a single mpk gene from o. tauri  and used its protein sequence to root a bootstrapped consensus tree. we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the  <dig> bnampks in the context of mpk proteins retrieved from a representative selection of species  and then in all the mpk sequences collected . we found that the identified  <dig> bnampks could be assigned unambiguously to four separate clades, together with  <dig> atmpks  <cit> . group a included bnampk <dig> and - <dig>  group b includes bnampk <dig> and - <dig> and, group c includes bnampk <dig> and - <dig>  whereas six bnampks belong to d, which are bnampk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  most mpks are classified into group d instead of group a, b or c, which is partially in agreement with previous study in rice  <cit> . this indicates that gene loss may have occurred in groups a to c, after the monocot-dicot divergence  <cit> . as expected, most of the bnampks were clustered more closely with arabidopsis than those of other species.

mpks are located at the terminus of prototypical sequential cascades, and can be phosphorylated and therefore activated by mkks via dual phosphorylation of conserved threonine and tyrosine residues in the motif txy, which is located in the activation loop  between subdomains vii and viii of mpks  <cit> . each of the  <dig> bnampks we identified possessed a tey or tdy signature . a mey motif was identified in bdmpk <dig>  <cit>  and also mpk from other species including smmpk <dig>  hvmpk <dig> and ntmpk <dig>  since s. moellendorffii is a member of an ancient vascular plant lineage that first appeared in the fossil record some  <dig> million years ago  <cit> , the presence of an atypical mey-type activation loop in this species suggests its early divergence. as can be seen from figure 4a and additional file 5: figure s <dig>  the tey-type mpks can be classified into three groups, a, b and c, whereas all the tdy-type mpks form a more distinct group d, as described previously  <cit> . interestingly, in the ancient unicellular green alga o. tauri, we also identified a single mpk, which contains a tey motif, suggesting that the common ancestor of eukaryotic mpks may have been of tey type. during the long history of evolution and selective forces, mpk proteins may have acquired other types of txy motif besides the canonical tey motif  <cit> . in addition, the aforementioned three atypical mey-type mpk proteins we identified fell into the tey-b clade in the tree, whereas smmpk <dig> was clustered together with tdy clade . since all analyzed land plant lineages in the phylogenetic tree contained both tey- and tdy-type mpks, this indicated that an early gene duplication event likely generated the split between the two major canonical classes of tey- and tdy-type mpks  <cit> .

mpks may contain a cd domain, defined as dxxxxepxc, where x means any amino acid and the two adjacent acidic residues  are critical for interacting with a cluster of basic amino acids  in mkks  <cit> . we found that the groups a, b and c of bnampks possessed a cd or modified cd domain, while neither domain appeared in the group d , which is also consistent with previous findings from other species  <cit> . from the alignment of amino acid sequences of osmpks, atmpks and bnampks, we identified the characteristic motif of the mpk family, which is defined as fx7rx2rex8hx28mx3lx20qxlx6hxax3hrdlkpxnx6c and is conserved among rice, arabidopsis and canola as well as o. tauri, except for atmpk <dig> and its ortholog bnampk <dig> . bnampk <dig> and atmpk <dig> had a tyr  instead of phe  at the very beginning of the conserved motif. however, the osmpk <dig>  downloaded from the rice genome annotation project lacked this region due to an unknown reason.

the conserved motifs in the  <dig> bnampk proteins were also analyzed using meme <dig>  and a schematic of the motifs is presented . seven motifs were conserved in all of the members of bnampk, while motifs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are found only in some groups. for instance, group a, b and c did not have motif  <dig> at the c-terminal region while group c and d did not have motif  <dig> at the n-terminal end. similarly, we annotated the motifs from meme analysis and identified that eight of the ten motifs  are actually subdomains  of kinase domain of mpks  <cit> . motif  <dig> contains vi and vii subdomains, motif  <dig> is subdomain ix, motif  <dig> contains subdomain i harboring a glycine-rich loop  required for atp binding. motif  <dig> also contains subdomains ii and iii, which represent the active-site signature ilhrdlkpgnlli of serine/threonine protein kinases. motif  <dig> contains subdomains iv and v, motif  <dig> has subdomain xi and, motif  <dig> has subdmain viii, which has the conserved consensus -ty- motif in the catalytic domain of plant kinases. motif  <dig> has subdomain x. motifs  <dig> and  <dig> contain cd domain, which is dxxdex acting as a docking site for mapkks  <cit> . consistent with our finding in figure 4a, the motif analysis through meme <dig>  showed that group d did not have motif  <dig>  which is cd domain, while groups a, b and c had it .

from our phylogenetic analysis, multiple alignment and domain analysis of bnamkk and bnampk in canola, we concluded that mkk and some of the mpk family members may be conserved among monocots while others were lost after the divergence of the monocots and dicots. in all, the mpk signaling cascades were relatively conserved during long history of evolution, and genes belonging to the same clade or group might fulfill similar functions. the phylogenetic analysis together with the domain motif analysis presented will facilitate the functional annotation and study of uncharacterized mkks and mpks.

subcellular localization of bnamkk and bnampk proteins in vivo
previous reports of subcellular localization of mkks and mpks suggest specific functions of these proteins in response to diverse stimuli  <cit> . subcellular localization analysis of individual mapk modules in vivo is therefore helpful in understanding how a single mapk component can simultaneously mediate several responses and how a single stimulus could direct several different mapk modules to separate tasks  <cit> . we first used three different programs, wolf psort, cello v <dig>  and eslpred, to predict the subcellular localization of the  <dig> bnamkks and  <dig> bnampks . at the same time, we used tmhmm  to predict transmembrane helices  of these proteins, but failed to identify any tmh . secondly, to examine the subcellular localization of bnamkks and bnampks in planta, we randomly selected three bnamkk genes and four bnamkk genes for green fluorescent protein  fusion. to this end, the coding region of bnamkk <dig> - <dig> and - <dig> as well as bnampk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> were fused to the n-terminus of green fluorescent protein  reporter gene with a gly-ala rich peptide linker between cdss and gfp in a binary vector. then, a. tumefaciens cells transformed with each of these constructs and p <dig> protein of tomato bushy stunt virus were infiltrated into leaves of nicotiana benthamiana. two days later, under confocal microscope, we observed that both bnampk-gfp and bnamkk-gfp fusion proteins emitted green fluorescence signals in nuclei and in cytoplasm of epidermal cells of leaves , suggesting that the mpk and mkk proteins were localized to the cytoplasm and are small enough to diffuse or be trafficked to the nucleus. when the leaf discs were further treated with a hyperosmotic solution  for 1 h and the plasmolyzed tissues were examined with the same settings in confocal microscope, the gfp signals were still evident in both the cytoplasm and nuclei . taken together, these results indicated that both bnamkks and bnampks studied are localized both in the cytoplasm and nuclei. comparing the predicted localization patterns  to our observations using gfp , the results from in silico prediction and the in vivo experimental determination were generally similar, with some exception that highlight the need to examine localization in planta.

recent reports have provided direct evidence that specific arabidopsis and tobacco mpks can phosphorylate some wrky tfs to initiate transcription of target genes  <cit> . tfs are usually localized in the nuclei, as demonstrated by many studies including ours  <cit> . therefore, we also checked the subcellular localization of a wrky tf, bnawrky <dig>  in n. benthamiana and the result showed that it is localized in nuclei only , which is consistent with its role in gene transcription. as a control, in the n. benthamiana leaf cells transformed with the empty vector bearing gfp gene only, the gfp signals were also observed in both cytosol and nuclei . therefore, the co-localization of bnampks and bnawrkys might facilitate their interaction, phosphorylation and activation.

identification and validation of bnamkk-bnampk and bnampk-bnawrky interactions
so far, the best characterized mkk genes are from arabidopsis, which has  <dig> mkk genes, and which activate different mpks  <cit> . it is necessary to understand interactions between mkks and mpks to elucidate cross-talk between different signaling pathways. therefore, to characterize components of the bnampk cascade as well as their upstream and downstream interaction partners, we used the yeast two-hybrid  system to analyze interactions between seven bnamkks and  <dig> bnampks, as well as interactions between bnampks and bnawrky tfs. to do this, seven bnamkks and nine bnawrkys  were individually cloned in-frame into the pgadt <dig> vector while the  <dig> bnampk genes were cloned into pgbkt <dig> vector. this strategy was chosen to avoid possible transactivation of expression of marker genes  by the tfs to be tested in y2h. only yeast colonies expressing both of the interacting mkks and mpks  could grow on the selection media sd-ltha . only mkk-mpk and mpk-wrky pairs that showed interactions were reported in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the other combinations that did not show any interaction in our y2h assay were not presented here. the authenticity and strength of the interactions were further examined by titration assays and x-gal staining.

our y2h assay revealed that bnamkk <dig> significantly interacted with bnampk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  and bnamkk <dig> did not show any interaction with the other seven bnampks tested. on the other hand, bnamkk <dig> and - <dig> showed interactions with bnampk <dig> and - <dig> . when these interactions were compared to those between arabidopsis orthologs, atmkk <dig> was reported to interact with atmpk <dig>   <dig> and - <dig> in y2h  <cit> . interaction between atmkk <dig> and atmpk <dig> was previously identified by protein microarray  <cit> , although not validated in planta yet. these differences between our observations with canola proteins and previous observations using arabidopsis genes may be attributed to either technical or biological factors. different vectors and yeast strains were used in the canola and arabidopsis experiments. the proteins may have also evolved to have different interactions in these two species.

as for the downstream wrky transcription factors that bnampk may phosphorylate and activate, our y2h assay showed  that bnampk <dig> and - <dig> significantly interacted with bnawrky <dig> and bnamkk <dig> . this is in agreement with a previous study showing interaction between atmpk <dig> and atwrky <dig> through protein microarray profiling  <cit> , although the interaction needs to be validated in planta. a previous study demonstrated that atmekk <dig> could directly regulate atwrky <dig> in the process of leaf senescence  <cit> . based on the protein microarray analysis, validated in n. benthamiana, atwrky <dig> was phosphorylated when co-expressed with the atmkk7/atmpk <dig> module  <cit> . whether this is true also for the presumed canola orthologs is yet to be confirmed, since no cdna or est has been identified for bnamkk <dig>  nevertheless, our study indicates that both bnampk <dig> and - <dig> could act upstream of bnawrky <dig> and may therefore phosphorylate and activate bnawrky <dig> to transcribe downstream target genes in canola.

to confirm the interaction of bnamkk <dig> and bnampk <dig>  - <dig> as well as the interaction between bnampk <dig>  - <dig> and bnawrky <dig>  we performed in vivo bimolecular fluorescence complementation  analysis. yellow fluorescence signals appeared in infiltrated cells when bnamkk <dig> with bnampk <dig> were co-expressed and yfp signals also appeared in nuclei when bnampk <dig> and bnawrky <dig> were co-infiltrated . as a control, bnampk <dig> with empty vector did not show any yfp signal . as we identified that bnamkk <dig> interacted with bnampk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>   <dig> and - <dig> , and only bnampk1/ <dig> and - <dig> were found to interact with bnawrky <dig> and bnawrky <dig>  respectively , the downstream targets of bnampk <dig>  - <dig>  or - <dig> are still waiting to be identified through y2h screening of cdna libraries. as bnampk <dig> was identified to interact with both upstream banmkk <dig> and downstream bnawrky <dig> , these three components bnamkk9-mpk19-wrky <dig> may constitute a signaling module to regulate responses to endogeneous and external stimuli.

as mapks are recognized as nodal points in many signaling pathways, further efforts should include identification of their direct substrates and systematic observations of mapk signaling regulation in specific environmental or developmental contexts. in arabidopsis, only a few of the  <dig> mkks and  <dig> mpks as well as their targets have been characterized in vivo. for instance, overexpression of atmkk <dig> and atmkk <dig> accelerate cell death in n. benthamiana <cit>  and atmpk <dig> may affect synergism of the ja and sa signaling networks  <cit> . since atwrky <dig> regulates leaf senescence and defense against p. syringae <cit>  and atmkk <dig> was reported to be involved in the biosynthesis of ethylene and camlexin, and also participates in the process of leaf senescence  <cit> , we hypothesized that the bnamkk9-bnampk1/2-bnawrky <dig> module we identified in canola may function in leaf senescence, hormone signaling and defense responses. however, although atmkk <dig> regulates ethylene signaling through interactions with mpk <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> , we did not indentify any interaction of bnamkk <dig> with bnampk <dig> or - <dig>  this may reflect an inherent difference in signaling pathways between arabidopsis and canola, and highlights the necessity to study the mapk-mediated signaling pathways in canola separately, instead of simply inferring these networks from results in arabidopsis.

on the other hand, bnampk <dig> and - <dig> interacted significantly with both upstream bnamkk <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> and with downstream bnawrky <dig>  - <dig> as shown from the titration and x-gal assays . to confirm the authenticity of the interactions between mkk4/ <dig> and mpk3/ <dig>  we alternated the y2h vectors for mkk4/ <dig> and mpk3/ <dig>  which is to say that bnamkk4/ <dig> were cloned into pgbkt <dig> and bnampk3/ <dig> were cloned into pgadt <dig> vector. the interactions between bnamkk4/ <dig> and bnampk3/ <dig> were maintained even after the vectors were switched . similarly, in arabidopsis, mkk <dig> interacts with mpk3/ <dig> and mkk <dig> with mpk <dig> in y2h  <cit> . moreover, in protein microarrays, arabidopsis mkk <dig> interacts with mpk <dig>  and mkk <dig> with mpk3/ <dig>  <cit> , although these interactions need to be confirmed using a complementary technique, and their biological significance elucidated. further comparisons revealed that atmkk <dig> was reported to interact strongly with mpk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> but weakly with mpk <dig>  and no interaction between atmkk <dig> and mpk <dig> was detected  <cit> . hence, y2h analysis of interactions between bnamkk4/ <dig> and bnampk3/ <dig> are consistent with previous results with arabidopsis orthologs. however, the interactions between mkk <dig> and mpk3/ <dig> were different, despite the relatively close evolutionary relationship between arabidopsis and canola.

as for the possible signaling components downstream of mpk <dig> and - <dig> in arabidopsis, the function of the module of mekk1-mkk4/5-mpk3/ <dig> and their downstream targets wrky22/ <dig> are well known in regulating plant immune responses against p. syringae <cit> . another study showed that atmpk3/mpk <dig> activation could impede the infection of the fungal pathogen botrytis cinerea while the resistance was compromised in mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> mutants and, atmpk <dig> and  <dig> function upstream of phytoalexin deficient   <dig> and - <dig> to regulate the biosynthesis of camalexin and hence the plant immune response  <cit> . in arabidopsis plants expressing constitutively active mkk <dig> , following challenge with p. syringae, the levels of ja, et and sa were elevated rapidly, and the infection was therefore impeded. the downstream targets of mkk <dig> are mpk <dig> and  <dig>  and their transcript levels were also increased and the activity of mpk <dig> was triggered in mkk2-ee infected with p. syringae <cit> . however, whether bnampk <dig> and - <dig> and their associated complicated linear mpk pathway function in regulating plant immune response and other processes needs to be further analyzed.

as one group of the direct targets of map kinases in plants, wrky tfs play very important roles in modulating abiotic and biotic stresses responses. one of our previous reports has identified  <dig> wrky tf genes from canola and partially characterized some of them in the context of hormone responses and fungal pathogen challenge  <cit> . to test the interactions between the  <dig> bnampks and nine bnawrkys, we used y2h. the results demonstrated that bnampk3/ <dig> interacted strongly with bnawrky20/ <dig> . bnawrky <dig> and bnawrky <dig> belong to group i of the wrky gene family. we also found that the amino acid sequences of both bnawrky <dig> and - <dig> have proline-directed serines  and a docking domain  at their n-termini, which are widely conserved in group i wrkys  <cit> . the sp clusters are putative phosphorylation targets of mapks and the d domain is a cluster of basic residues followed by lxl motif 1-2- × 2-6-l/i- × -l/i) and it is thought to select the interacting mapks and determine the substrate specificity of mapks in mammals and yeast  <cit> , however the significance in plants still await to be tested. the identification of two upstream map kinases, bnampk <dig> and bnampk <dig>  would provide a clue that activities of bnawrky <dig> and - <dig> are likely regulated by them. so far, the ortholog of bnawrky <dig> in arabidopsis together with two other group i members atwrky <dig> and - <dig> has been shown to regulate salinity responses and thermotolerance  <cit> . however, the upstream regulators, especially map kinase, of atwrky <dig> in response to either salinity or heat have not been reported. moreover, the functions of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> in relation to signaling in other stresses have not yet been reported. finally, for some of the nine bnawrkys screened, we did not detect any interacting bnampks, which could be due to at least two causes. one possible explanation is that other unidentified bnampks may interact with them. alternatively, other types of protein kinases, like calcium-dependent protein kinases  may act upstream of these bnawrkys  <cit> .

through y2h, we also experimentally determined that bnamkk <dig> interacts with bnampk <dig> , while in arabidopsis mkk <dig> interacts with mpk4/ <dig> only  <cit> , further highlighting the limitations of arabidopsis as a model for canola. in arabidopsis, mkk <dig> and mpk <dig> both participate in aba and sugar signaling in the process of seed germination since loss of function mutants of mkk <dig>  mpk <dig> or both are resistant to aba or glucose treatments while on the contrary, the overexpression of atmkk <dig> or atmpk <dig> are sensitive to these treatments  <cit> . our study of bnamkk <dig> interactions with bnampk <dig> presented here suggests that these may play similar roles in seed germination, however these need to be characterized in detail.

in summary, from our yeast two-hybrid and bifc assays, two complete signaling modules could be inferred, among which one is bnamkk9-bnampk1/2-bnawrky <dig> and the other bnamkk2/4/5-bnampk3/6-bnawrky20/ <dig> . other mapk modules have also been identified, with the upstream bnamkk <dig> and downstream map kinases, bnampk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> . among these identified interaction pairs, quite a few have not been reported even in arabidopsis suggesting that the different combination of bnamkk and bnampks, as well as bnampks and bnawrkys very likely mediate the responses to different external and internal stimuli in canola.

transactivation and truncation assays of bnampk-interacting bnawrky transcription factors
to further characterize the biological significance of the aforementioned bnampk-interacting bnawrky tfs, we performed transactivation assays of bnawrky <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> in yeast . we cloned bnawrky genes into the vector pgbkt <dig>  the results showed that neither bnawrky <dig>  nor bnawrky <dig> , showed transactivation activity, suggesting that they may be transcriptional repressors. in contrast, bnawrky <dig> showed transactivation activity in yeast , indicating it is a transcriptional activator. sequence analysis of the bnawrky <dig> protein sequence showed that it contained a transactivation domain  near it n-terminus , while no such domain was detected in bnawrky <dig>  or - <dig>  although yeast colonies expressing full length bnawrky <dig> protein could not grow on the selective medium sd-ltha, colonies expressing a truncated version of bnawrky <dig>  namely bnawrky20-d <dig>  in which the c-terminal amino acids between  <dig> and  <dig> were deleted, grew on sd-ltha , suggesting that the sequence of amino acids between  <dig> and  <dig> of bnawrky <dig> has the transcriptional repression activity. interestingly, we also found that bnawrky <dig> can interact with itself in yeast, indicating that it may homodimerize as part of its normal function . a previous study also demonstrated that another three arabidopsis wrky tfs, wrky <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  which belong to group iia, are transcriptional repressors and interact with each other in yeast  <cit> .

to further identify the interacting regions of bnawrky <dig> with bnampk <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  we constructed a series of truncated versions of bnawrky <dig> and analyzed their interaction with bnampk <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  as shown in figure 7b, yeast colonies expressing full length of bnawrky <dig> and bnampk <dig>  or - <dig>  - <dig> could grow on selective media sd-ltha, and yeast colonies expressing bnawrky20-d <dig>  bnampk <dig> or - <dig> could also grow on selection medium sd-ltha. these results imply that both bnampk <dig> and - <dig> can interact with both bnawrky <dig> and truncated bnawrky <dig> containing the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids. as for bnampk <dig>  it can only interact with the full length and the c-terminal peptide  of bnawrky <dig> . for bnawrky <dig>  we also constructed three deletion plasmids and, y2h assay demonstrated that both bnampk <dig> and bnampk <dig> interacted with bnawrky53-d <dig>  which harbors amino acids of 51- <dig> , but did not interact with bnawrky53-d <dig> or bnawrky53-d <dig> .

expression analyses of bnamkk and bnampk genes in response to abiotic and biotic stresses
accumulating evidence has demonstrated that members of mkk and mpk gene families in arabidopsis, rice as well as other species function in responses to abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . therefore, we examined transcript expression profiles of canola bnamkk and bnampk using quantitative real-time rt-pcr  under different abiotic, biotic stress treatments as well as hormone stimuli. we treated 18-day-old canola seedlings with jasmonic acid , salicylic acid , abscisic acid , methyl viologen , acc, nacl, cold, oxalic acid  and s. sclerotiorum. among these, ja and sa are two known plant defense hormones, with ja mediating responses to necrotrophs  <cit>  and sa regulating responses to biotrophic pathogens and systemic acquired resistance  <cit> . aba is a well-known stress hormone involved in abiotic stress such as salinity and drought. however, recent evidences showed that aba also has a prominent role in biotic stress  <cit> . mv was used to induce oxidative burst or accumulation of reactive oxygen species  in plant cells, which is similar to the effect generated by hydrogen peroxide , but more stable than h2o <dig>  acc was used to mock the effect of ethylene, which is an important hormone in many processes including mediating different types of induced resistance  <cit> . oa is a virulence factor secreted by the necrotrophic pathogen s. sclerotiorum <cit> . recent studies have shown that controlling oa production might help to protect canola plants against s. sclerotiorum <cit> .

statistical analyses of qrt-pcr data from three independent biological replicates demonstrated that transcripts of four out of five  bnamkk genes and six out of nine  bnampk genes were significantly induced or repressed by at least one stress condition of cold, oa, sa and s. sclerotiorum . as for bnamkk genes, four genes  were responsive to sa and only three genes  were responsive to s. sclerotiorum. one gene  is significantly induced by mv at 6 h while another gene  was responsive to oa. as for bnampks genes, three genes  were responsive to sa, four  were responsive to s. sclerotiorum and, two  were responsive oa treatment . bnampk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were also responsive to sa treatment, although the changes are not significantly . the results we presented here show that bnamkk and bnampk genes are generally responsive to biotic and abiotic stress treatments and may play an important role in responses to environmental stresses and pathogens. these results also highlight the extent of cross-talk that exists between abiotic and biotic stresses.

comparison of the expression patterns of bnamkks and bnampks with those of orthologs in arabidopsis
to further compare the expression profiles and roles of bnamkk and bnampk with their orthologs in arabidopsis, we extracted the expression profiles of atmkk and atmpk genes from genevestigator . we found that on the whole, the responses of mkk and mpk genes between canola and arabidopsis plants at the transcript levels to a variety of abiotic and biotic stress treatments were similar and showed a large degree of correlation . for instance, atmkk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> are all induced by sa treatment, which is consistent with our observation on bnamkk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> . atmkk <dig> is induced by ja, sa, aba, oxidative stress, salt and cold as well as a necrotrophic fungus, b. cinerea, which implies that atmkk <dig> may be involved in response to diverse stresses, while its ortholog in canola is induced significantly only by sa and cold , which suggests that atmkk <dig> and bnamkk <dig> may play different roles in two different plant species. atmkk <dig> was reported to be involved in the biosynthesis of ethylene and camlexin, and also participate the process of leaf senescence  <cit> . we also noted that bnampk <dig> was induced by cold, which is consistent with the expression pattern of its presumed ortholog in arabidopsis . atmkk <dig> and atmpkk <dig> with their upstream atmekk <dig> and downstream atmpk <dig> function together in regulating plant innate immunity  <cit> . bnamkk <dig> did not respond to any treatment tested in our project, however, its ortholog atmkk <dig> was reported to participate in ja signaling pathway together with atmpk <dig>  <cit> .

in summary, after comparing the transcript expression profiles of mkk and mpk genes between canola and arabidopsis, we found that most, but not all of them show similar responses towards various abiotic and biotic stress treatments. however, some differences between the bnamkks and bnampks and their arabidopsis counterparts were noticed. the function of some members of the mkk and mpk gene families in stress-related hormone signaling, for instance, mkk <dig>  mpk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> even in arabidopsis still wait to be studied. furthermore, what is the function of bnampk <dig> and - <dig> and are they involved in early signaling process leading to leaf senescence modulated by bnawrky53? based on our recent results from a systematic functional analysis of canola mapkkk genes, we found that bnamkk <dig> is a target for at least three different bnamapkkks , suggesting bnamkk <dig> may be a convergence point in the mapk signaling cascade. therefore, bnamkk <dig> may be integrated in certain signaling pathway in canola defense response and this need to be elucidated through a more detailed functional analysis.

we were also curious to know whether each component of the linear modules we identified showed similar transcriptional responses to the hormone and stress treatments in a similar trend. we found that components of the same module generally showed similar responses to a given treatment, although some differences were observed. for instance, in the bnamkk9-bnampk <dig> module, both genes were induced by sa . in the module of bnamkk9-bnampk1/2-bnawrky <dig>  the transcript levels of bnamkk <dig>  bnampk <dig>  - <dig> and bnawrky <dig> were increased by sa while changes in bnampk <dig> and bnawrky <dig> were not significant . on the other hand, some components of the same module showed different responses. for instance, in the module of bnamkk9-bnampk <dig> and bnamkk9-bnampk <dig>  bnamkk <dig> transcripts did not show any response towards s. sclerotiorum infection at either  <dig> or 24 h, while bnampk <dig> was induced and bnampk <dig> repressed by s. sclerotiorum inoculation . in the module of bnamkk9-bnampk1/2-bnawrky <dig>  bnampk <dig> was induced while bnawrky <dig> repressed by s. sclerotiorum . our results suggest that bnamkk <dig> may regulate different mpk components in fulfilling different functions in responses to diverse stresses. in addition, in the module of bnamkk2/4/5-bnampk3/6-bnawrky20/ <dig>  bnamkk <dig>  - <dig>  bnampk <dig> and - <dig> were all induced by sa , which suggests that this module might be integrated in the sa signaling pathway. surprisingly, the transcript level changes of each component in this module were different when challenged by s. sclerotiorum, bnamkk <dig> was repressed  while bnampk <dig> and the downstream target bnawrky <dig> were both induced by s. sclerotiorum . as for modules of bnamkk1/2-bnampk <dig>  we observed that bnamkk <dig> and - <dig> were induced by sa, s. sclerotiorum and oa  and bnampk <dig> is induced by cold only . interestingly, no significant changes on the mrna abundance of the above selected bnamkk or bnampk genes were observed when ja was applied to seedlings. all of the data suggest that post-transcriptional regulation and post-translational modifications including phosphorylation might play an important role in modulating their kinase activities beyond the transcriptional regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we identified and cloned seven bnamkk and  <dig> bnampk genes from an important crop, canola  and reconstructed the phylogeny of both families based on major land plant lineages. our study complements several previous analyses which inferred the phylogenetics based on limited land plant lineages  <cit> . since the core of mapk signaling in all eukaryotes is organized in three-tiered modules, it was necessary to dissect the subcellular localization of individual mkk and mapk members, as well as their interactors to dismantle the complexity of plant mapk modules and networks. our gfp-based translational fusions confirmed the cytoplasmic and nuclear subcellular localizations of both bnamkk and bnampk.

y2h assays and in vivo bifc confirmation identified two linear pathways of mpk signaling modules, composed of bnamkk-bnampk-bnawrky and some new interacting partners . the two complete modules inferred based are bnamkk9-bnampk1/2-bnawrky <dig> and bnamkk2/4/5-bnampk3/6-bnawrky20/ <dig> . some incomplete modules were also identified, such as bnamkk9-bnampk5/9/19/ <dig> . among the identified interaction pairs, many have not been previously identified, even in arabidopsis. analysis of their expression patterns suggested that bnamkk <dig>  bnampk <dig>   <dig> and bnamkk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and bnampk <dig> and - <dig> may be integrated into the sa signaling pathway to trigger defense response of canola . further experiments could be carried on in the protoplast system to accurately determine the linear modules involved signaling pathways. moreover, genetic analysis of selected mkk and mpk components of canola through overexpression and rna interference  techniques are underway. this work presented here will be helpful for us to better understand the roles of bnamkk and bnampk genes in canola response to environmental stresses, especially the plant response to biotic stresses.
