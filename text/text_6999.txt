BACKGROUND
iron is an essential element for the gram-negative pathogenic bacterium vibrio cholerae. it plays important roles in the microbe’s survival and its ability to cause the diarrheal disease cholera of v. cholerae. nevertheless, the concentration of free iron is extremely low in the environment as well as in the human hosts. under iron starvation conditions, v. cholerae has evolved several high-affinity iron uptake systems  <cit> . synthesis and secretion of the catechol-type siderophore vibriobactin is the main mechanism for obtaining iron  <cit> . siderophores, such as schizokinen  <cit> , enterobactin  <cit>  and ferrichrome  <cit> , produced by other microorganisms, can also be utilized by v. cholerae.

heme, an excellent iron source in the environment and human hosts, can be used by v. cholerae in the free form or with heme-binding proteins  <cit> . it is first transported into the cell with the assistance of the corresponding tonb-dependent outer membrane receptors and atp-binding cassette transporter system proteins  <cit> , and then the iron released from heme by cytoplasmic heme oxygenase.

however, to date, no heme oxygenase has been reported in v. cholerae. blast searches against the ncbi database  <cit>  have also returned no heme oxygenase homologues for v. cholerae. therefore, the fate of heme after it enters v. cholerae’s cytoplasm remains mysterious, and little is known regarding which proteins contribute to heme utilization in the cytoplasm. in  <dig>  wyckoff and coworkers identified in v. cholerae the heme-binding protein hutz, a protein essential for the optimal utilization of heme as an iron source  <cit> . however, no heme oxygenase activity has been observed for this protein, which indicates that hutz serves only as a heme storage protein  <cit> . ncbi blast searches have shown that hutz belongs to the pyridoxine-5'-phosphate  oxidase-like superfamily and shares 35% sequence identity with the heme oxygenases hugz from helicobacter pylori <cit>  and chuz from campylobacter jejuni <cit> . meanwhile, sequence comparisons have shown that hutz shares low sequence identities  with other known representative heme oxygenases, such as hmuo from corynebacterium diphtheria <cit> , hemo from neisseria meningitidis <cit> , isdg from bacillus anthracis  <cit> , and chus from escherichia coli o157:h <dig>  <cit> .

to gain further insight into the mechanism of the mysterious function of hutz, this protein from v. cholerae  was overexpressed and its crystal structure determined at  <dig>  Å resolution. the hutz structure appeared to a typical split-barrel fold that is usually conserved in fmn-binding proteins. as heme did not cocrystallize with hutz, molecular docking and site-directed mutation experiments were performed to investigate the interaction mechanism of hutz and heme.

in the absence of experimentally solved protein structures, homology modeling is widely used to predict a structure based on one or more known structures of homologous proteins. such a model is developed based on the general rule that similar protein sequences correspond to similar protein structures. notably, in the comparison of the structures of hutz and hugz, a structural mismatch was identified in one amino acid residue after the corner of β <dig> of hutz, where both protein sequences are identical except for two pairs of different amino acid residues. this observation suggested a potential hazard in the accuracy or application of the homology modeling method, in particular in the accuracy of the input sequence alignment. in the light of this, a series of homologous models were constructed to further verify the sequence-structure relationship between hutz and hugz and to explore functional implications from the hutz structure. as chuz and hugz share high sequence identity  and structural similarity  of  <dig>  Å for the protein backbone), hugz was employed as the representative heme oxygenase for homology modeling of different hutz variants and for structural comparisons.

RESULTS
the overall structure of hutz
the structure of hutz contains four monomer molecules  in an asymmetric unit that form two homodimers  . each monomer includes amino acid residues 13– <dig> of the entire hutz protein . protein interface analysis with ccp4i showed that the interface area between monomers a and b was  <dig>  Å <dig> and  <dig>  Å <dig> for c and d, covering approximately 18% of the total solvent accessible surface area of  <dig> Å <dig>  this suggested that the homodimer forms, which represent the aggregation state of most split-barrel proteins in solution, were stable for hutz. the existence of hutz homodimers in solution was further confirmed by gel filtration chromatography on a superdex- <dig> column .

although the hutz homodimer adopted a typical split-barrel fold that is commonly conserved in fmn-binding proteins, no such activity was observed for hutz . superimposition of both monomers from each dimer produces an rmsd of  <dig>  Å for all corresponding cα atoms. a hutz monomer consisted of four α-helices interwoven with six β-strands , a structure similar to the c-terminal domain of hugz    <cit> . six antiparallel strands, β1-β <dig>  produced a β-barrel of a greek key topology . helices α <dig> and α <dig> were packed against the β-barrel and blocked each opening of the β-barrel. helices α <dig> and α <dig> were loaded on one side of the β-barrel, with the hutz dimer bound mainly through interactions of exposed β-barrel from each monomer. the two β-barrels were packed with each other side by side, bringing together surfaces distant from helices α <dig> and α <dig> on the loading side. 

heme-binding site
a number of approaches were attempted to produce crystals of hutz-heme complex, but no crystals were obtained. in this case, we carried out molecular docking to investigate the interactions between heme and hutz. there are two large clefts in the hutz dimer interfaces that are postulated, due to similarities with hugz, to be the heme-binding pocket. the first-ranked resulting model of hutz dimer-heme complex showed that the main contributors to the heme coordination included his <dig> loaded at the helix α <dig> of one monomer and arg <dig> originating from strand β <dig> of the other . these two residues cooperatively coordinated the iron atom in the center of the heme molecule, with the distance between his <dig> and the iron atom at approximately  <dig>  Å and between arg <dig> and the iron atom at  <dig>  Å. uv absorption spectral analysis on native and mutant forms of hutz-heme complexes were performed to explore whether his <dig> and arg <dig> were both necessary for heme-binding. the soret peak for the native hutz-heme complex was at  <dig> nm; for the single mutant h63a reconstituted with heme, it was slightly shifted to  <dig> nm, indicating that his <dig> slightly affected heme binding. for r92a, the soret band was not altered in comparison with the native hutz-heme complex , suggesting that arg <dig> did not affect heme binding. however, there was no characteristic soret peak detected for the double point mutant h63a-r92a reconstituted with heme. the soret peak data collected were from full length hutz and truncated hutz . these observations indicated that at least one of these residues, his <dig> and arg <dig>  must exist to effectively coordinate the iron atom in heme, and either of them is sufficient. additionally, eleven residues from monomer a  and three residues from monomer b  around the heme-binding cleft participated in stabilizing the heme. these residues were fully conserved or replaced with similar residues in comparison with the residues stabilizing the heme group in the hugz-heme complex .

structural comparison between hutz and hugz
structural superimposition revealed that the hutz monomer shared high structural similarity with hugz monomer , which is a heme oxygenase from helicobacter pylori <cit> . sequence alignment showed that the hugz n-terminal domain  was absent in hutz, and the c-terminal loop  of hugz was variable in hutz. in hutz, the β <dig> contained a four-residue-long corner structure  that divides β <dig> into two segments , designated as β6- <dig>  and β6- <dig>  respectively, while the corresponding β <dig> in hugz is also divided into two segments β9- <dig>  and β9- <dig>  by a three-residue-long corner  . the fo_fc omit map clearly revealed the positions of the four amino acid residues composing the corner of β <dig> in hutz . very interestingly, although the segment gly143-tyr <dig> in hutz was identical to the segment gly218-tyr <dig> in hugz except for two pairs of amino acid residues  , these residues did not match each other in one-to-one correspondence in the superimposition of three-dimensional structures . rather, β6- <dig> was shifted frontward by one amino acid residue relative to β9- <dig>  for example, phe <dig> of hutz did not match phe <dig> of hugz, but corresponded to the preceding arg <dig>  this structural mismatch was substantially represented as changes in hydrogen bonding patterns between adjacent β-strands. two adjacent β-strands form a hydrogen bond network in which the n-h groups or c = o groups of one strand establish hydrogen bonds with the c = o groups or n-h groups of another. normally, there are two hydrogen bonds  on every second amino acid residue in one strand. in the hutz and hugz structures, the hydrogen bonding patterns were both regular on β6- <dig> and β9- <dig> . however, in the four-residue-long corner of hutz, no hydrogen bonds were detected, whereas in the three-residue-long corner of hugz, two consecutive hydrogen bonds existed on lys <dig> and glu <dig>  in this vein, after both corner regions, the correspondence between the hydrogen bond providing residues on β6- <dig> and β9- <dig> were not in line with that of their sequence alignment . there was a mismatch of one amino acid residue. 

due to this structural mismatch, the side chains of all residues involved in this region pointed to opposite directions in hutz and hugz . the side chain of phe <dig> in hutz protruded into a hydrophobic pocket formed by ile <dig>  phe <dig>  lys <dig> and leu <dig>  whereas the side chain of corresponding residue phe <dig> in hugz turns to another hydrophobic pocket on the opposite side . starting from this pair of residues, the conformations of the succeeding residues become significantly different between hutz and hugz.

structural modeling of hutz and its variants
anfinsen’s dogma  <cit>  states that a protein’s native structure is determined by its amino acid sequence and is a stable and kinetically accessible minimum of free energy. accordingly, the local structural divergence between hutz and hugz should result from certain amino acid diversities. therefore five homologous models for hutz and its variants were constructed, and their rationalities were assessed to determine their essential residues. the compatibility of every amino acid with its conformation was assessed by proqres, but the focus was on the β <dig> of hutz and the corresponding regions in other models, where the structural mismatch occured.

the first model  was generated for the native sequence of hutz using the hugz’s structure as the template. thus, m <dig> possessed hutz’s sequence and did not show a structural mismatch with hugz. structural evaluations showed that both crystal structures received higher scores than m <dig> . this result indicated that the present crystal structure, which possessed a structural mismatch to hugz, better fitted the hutz protein sequence than m <dig>  which matched well the structure of hugz; namely, the structural mismatch of the present crystal structure was reasonable. simultaneously, the structure of hugz also well adapted to the sequence of hugz.

next, the goal was to identify which residue was the main contributor to hutz’s structural shift. from the beginning of the corner region , where the structural mismatch begins, to tyr <dig> of hutz, there were a total of four different residue pairs between hutz and hugz . these residues were very likely responsible for the structural shift and, thus, four single point variants  for hutz were designed and four models  generated for them, respectively . the mutated residues in hutz were simply replaced with the corresponding residues of hugz, and, as with m <dig>  all variant models used the hugz structure as a template, such that all of them were aligned with hugz in one-to-one correspondence both on the sequence and structural levels. structural evaluations of these models suggested three things . first, the two crystal structures were most favored by their sequences, as they generally received higher scores than the homologous models. second, the score curves of the hugz crystal structure and all homologous models exhibited similar shapes, which were obviously different from the hutz crystal structure, because all models were constructed using the hugz crystal structure as a template. last, among all homologous models, m <dig> was evaluated as the best, while m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> were close to one another, suggesting that the sequence of the variant p140f better fitted the hugz structure than those of other variants. in other words, although the residues pro <dig>  glu <dig>  gln <dig> and leu <dig> may together have contributed to the formation of hutz’s structural shift, pro <dig> played a more important role than other residues. moreover, pro <dig> was located at the very beginning of the corner region, where the structural shift also began, underlining the role of pro <dig> in the local folding of hutz β <dig> 

discussion
hutz, a unique heme storage protein identified in v. cholerae, is necessary for optimal heme utilization  <cit> , but no heme oxygenase activity has been detected for hutz. the crystal structure of the heme oxygenase hugz shows that there are two symmetric active sites located at the hugz dimmer interface, formed by the c-terminal region  from one monomer and α <dig> from the other  <cit> . the c-terminal loop functions as a flexible portion of the active site, which is supposed to keep the substrate heme molecule in proper conformation for the heme oxygenase activity as well as to close off the active pocket  <cit> . in the hutz structure, the homologous heme-binding pocket involved β <dig> and β <dig>  which corresponded with β <dig> and β <dig> in hugz. the structure from β <dig> to the c-terminal loop, which corresponded to β <dig>  β <dig> and the c-terminal loop in hugz, was truncated in the present structure. thus, it was unclear whether the missing portion participated in the heme-binding pocket or it resulted in the lack of hutz enzymic activity. his <dig> from the c-terminal of hutz, corresponds to the fully conserved his <dig> in hugz that is responsible for the heme iron atom coordination  <cit> . notably here, hutz’s his <dig> did not contribute to iron coordination and enzymatic activity in hutz as, when mutant h170a was reconstituted with heme, the soret peak did not change in comparison with the native hutz-heme complex . this study of the structural mismatch between hutz and hugz provided an important clue for resolving this issue. because the corner of β <dig> of hutz includes one more amino acid residue than that of hugz, hutz’s β6- <dig>  ends one amino acid earlier than hugz’s β9- <dig> . it is known that the torsion angle of n-cα-c-n in the backbone of a β-strand is about 120°. therefore, the main chains of the end residues of the two β-strands  point in different directions to form a 60° angle . this direction deviation led to an absolute mismatch between the structures of hutz  and hugz  \, and might have led to even larger structural differences in their c-terminal regions . in this regard, it was speculated that the c-terminal loop, which is essential for hugz enzymatic activity, might have turned away from the heme-binding pocket of hutz and yielded the pocket more exposed than that of hugz. this might then have resulted in low heme-binding affinity and a deficiency in hutz enzymatic activity. in addition, the possibility was excluded here that truncating the protein resulted in a structural shift of β6- <dig> in hutz for three reasons. first, hutz was truncated here because of the twinning and fragile crystals of the full length protein. if the complete hutz structure matched hugz at β6- <dig> and the c-terminal loop, good full length crystals would have been obtained, as have been attained by hu and coworkers  <cit> . second, an extensive hydrogen bond network connected two parallel β-stands and maintained their stable conformations. truncating the residues that follow β6- <dig> might not have provided enough energy to destroy the normal hydrogen bonding and rearrange them. and third, the hypothetical hutz structure  that matches hugz at β6- <dig> evaluated even more poorly than the present truncated hutz structure.

methods
protein expression, purification and site-directed mutagenesis
the hutz gene was amplified from genomic dna of v. cholerae and subcloned into the pet21b expression vector  between the ndei and xhoi restriction cut sites. the n-terminal and c-terminal regions  were removed during cloning, resulting in a construct of 13-150-his tagged fusion protein for further expression.

bl <dig>  cells containing plasmids for the recombinant hutz protein were grown in l broth media supplemented with  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin. once the culture attained an od <dig> of  <dig> , the incubation temperature was decreased to 15°c, and protein expression induced by adding isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of  <dig>  mm. after  <dig> h of expression, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and the pellet resuspended in lysis buffer , and lysed by sonication. cell debris was then removed by centrifugation at 28500 × g for  <dig> min. the resulting soluble fractions containing recombinant protein hutz was loaded onto a ni-chelating sepharose affinity column  equilibrated with lysis buffer. the affinity column was washed extensively with lysis buffer and all proteins eluted with elution buffer . the elution protein was further purified using an ion-exchange column , conditioned with equilibration buffer , and eluted using a linear  <dig> ml gradient of 0– <dig>  m nacl. finally, hutz protein was purified using size exclusion chromatography . fractions were pooled according to protein purity monitored by sds-page, and the final protein concentration at  <dig> mg/ml. all mutant proteins were purified using the same procedure.

crystallization and data collection
hutz was crystallized using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 20°c by mixing equal volumes of protein with reservoir solution containing  <dig>  m na/k phosphate and  <dig>  m hepes at ph  <dig> . because the crystals of full length hutz were twinning and fragile and could not be used to obtain high resolution diffraction data, the protein was truncated to amino acid residues 13– <dig> to grow high quality crystals, which appeared about seven to ten d and reached full size in two wk. diffraction data were collected at the shanghai sychrotron radiation facility beamline bl17u <dig>  to prevent radiation damage, crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant buffer containing 15% glycerol  plus reservoir buffer and then flash-cooled using a nitrogen stream, with the temperature around the crystals maintained at  <dig> k throughout data collection. data sets were processed using the hkl <dig> software suite  <cit> . the crystals belonged to the space group p <dig> with four macromolecules in an asymmetric unit, with unit cell dimensions of a = b =  <dig>  Å and c =  <dig>  Å.

structure determination
hutz’s structure was determined by molecular replacement with phaser from ccp4i software, using the search model alr <dig>  from nostoc sp. with sequence identity of 43%. the atomic model was built using coot  <cit>  and refined using phenix  <cit> . data collection and structure refinement statistics are shown in table  <dig>  all molecular graphics figures were generated with pymol .

docking and homology modeling
autodock  <dig>   <cit>  was used to perform flexible docking in the hutz-heme complex. the heme was restricted within a grid box  that enveloped the hutz binding cleft, which was determined through similarities with the known crystal structure of the hugz-heme complex. docking searches were executed using the lamarckian genetic algorithm and a maximum number of  <dig> , <dig> energy evaluations. after docking searches were finished, the first-ranked model, based on binding energy, was selected as the final result from  <dig> candidate solutions.

a series of homologous models of hutz and its variants were generated using the modeller  <dig>  program package  <cit>  with hugz  as a template. the input files for each target sequence were a pairwise sequence alignment  and the coordinate file of the template. the number of output models for each target was set to five, and other modeller options at default. the qualities of all resulting models were evaluated with proqres  <cit> , a neural-network based local protein model quality predictor, which analyzes the compatibility of every amino acid residue with its conformation in a three-dimensional model.

CONCLUSIONS
we determined the crystal structure of hutz from v. cholerae at  <dig>  Å resolution and compared the structure with that of its homologous protein hugz. the structural mismatch between hutz and hugz presented a rare case in which the structural alignment was not in accordance with the sequence alignment for two highly similar proteins . this observation suggested a potential hazard in the assumed accuracy of template selection of the traditional homology modeling method. if a homologous model of hutz is constructed using the default sequence alignment with hugz and the hugz structure as a template, the resulting model will be inaccurate.
