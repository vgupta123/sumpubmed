BACKGROUND
the new generations of transgenic plants require more precisely regulated expression of transferred genes, which calls for the identification and characterization of novel promoters in higher plants. species-specific promoters can be utilized for more precise dissections of basic biological processes as well as for the generation of transgenic crops with possibly more favourable public acceptance  <cit> .

characterization of plant genes via t-dna tagging represents a powerful approach to uncover new regulatory sequences  <cit> . promoter tagging makes use of a promoterless selectable or reporter gene flanking a t-dna border. after integration into the plant genome, this reporter gene is activated by flanking promoter sequences thus enabling study of native expression patterns within original genomic contexts. use of the luciferase  gene as reporter gene allows real-time detection of the luciferase  enzyme in a non-invasive and non-destructive manner combined with high sensitivity  <cit> . furthermore, the short half-life of luc activity  <cit>  allows the monitoring of dynamic gene expression changes, which makes the luc reporter gene ideal for tagging promoters and genes exhibiting induced or developmentally regulated expression.

however, to date, relatively few research groups have exploited the luc reporter system for this purpose. only recently, two gene-trap vectors containing the wild type luc gene were constructed and successfully used in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana for identification of genes activated by light during seedling development  <cit> . tagging of low temperature  , responsive promoters was also reported in arabidopsis seedlings using a large-scale in vivo luc screening system  <cit> , but quantitative data on the level of induction or repression during or after lt treatment and on the developmental regulation of these responses were not presented. most plant t-dna tagging vectors have so far been designed with the uida  reporter gene, which excludes non-destructive and real-time activity screening of the gene tagged  <cit> . in relation to tagging temperature-responsive genes, mandal et al.  <cit>  reported the identification of one  tagged arabidopsis line exhibiting β-glucuronidase  activity after a  <dig> h treatment at 4°c. screening for tagged lt-responsive genes was recently also performed in rice by subjecting plant samples to lt before measuring gus activity at room temperature  <cit> .

to date, and to the best of our knowledge, no plant promoter showing specific inducible activity during in vitro culture has been isolated and utilized. promoters with high and/or specific in vitro activity could be employed for multiple purposes:  modeling at a test-tube scale important traits and processes such as organ formation ,  systematic comparison of in vitro regeneration vs. in vivo development,  understanding genomic adaptation processes  during in vitro culture,  discovering novel genes such as transcription factors that regulate the expression of specific genes important during the in vitro stage, and  limiting expression of selectable marker genes for generation of transgenic crops.

bananas  are the most important fruit crop on earth but their genetic improvement is seriously hampered by high degrees of sterility in most edible, triploid cultivars  <cit> . therefore, integration of biotechnological tools into banana improvement programs appears imperative, including generation of transgenic plants with useful traits added. though several heterologous promoters have been used for genetic transformation of banana  <cit> , no native promoter has been utilized so far to drive the expression of agronomically interesting genes. a high-throughput luc tagging platform developed for banana  <cit>  was therefore applied here for the identification and characterization of native promoters regulated during in vitro culture and/or by lt  treatment. at this temperature, in the field as well as under controlled conditions  <cit>  banana growth is arrested in the interior of the pseudostem  <cit> , and chilling injury occurs  <cit> . this temperature is regularly reached in subtropical production areas  <cit> , and presents a real production constraint. a lt-reactive or -inducible promoter can thus be instrumental in designing a protection strategy, where a stress resistance gene would be switched on only when a stressing temperature is reached.

we performed a large-scale screening for luc activation on t-dna tagged cell cultures subjected to lt stress in different developmental stages of plant regeneration in vitro. flanking regions were isolated from a selected line containing five inserted tags and characterized in detail. one upstream sequence was shown to exert promoter activity to lt stress in a developmentally regulated manner, i.e. induction at undifferentiated stage and during early differentiation but not in in vitro plants. the observed activity of this promoter was confirmed by its similar expression pattern after transfer to a different genetic background suggesting that it could be used reliably for transgenic applications.

RESULTS
tagging of promoters active during in vitro regeneration
in order to search for endogenous promoters, banana cell suspensions were transformed with the promoter trap vector petkul <dig>  carrying a promoterless luciferase gene. two months after agrobacterium transformation, screening of  <dig>  independent cell colonies at room temperature revealed  <dig>  cell colonies showing baseline activation . this result is comparable to bla frequencies previously obtained with this construct . after discarding colonies exhibiting luc activity, the remaining cell colonies were re-screened for bla  one month later during  <dig> h followed by a lt treatment of 8°c while monitoring luc activity in real-time for up to  <dig> h. this type of screening at cell colony stage  was repeated at the differentiation stage  when shoot induction is initiated and at the plantlet stage  for  <dig> responsive lines, as summarized . despite the early removal of positive colonies, bla  was still detected at developmental stage i in all tagged lines  though at variable levels. luc activity was absent at all times in untransformed control lines  indicating that promoter sequences were tagged in these petkul <dig> transformed lines. the level of bla varied greatly throughout in vitro regeneration for almost all tagged lines. for example, in tagged line  <dig>  luc activity at 26°c reached very strong, strong and moderate levels at developmental stages i, ii and iii, respectively . in contrast, bla remained very strong in line  <dig> throughout all stages of in vitro regeneration. upon lt treatment  at stage i, enhanced luc activity was observed in lines  <dig> and  <dig>  which was lost in subsequent screenings at stage iii and ii, respectively . the luc activity pattern was monitored throughout in vitro regeneration as shown for line  <dig> in detail . the apparent lack of luc activity at stage i at 26°c  is due to the upper greyscale setting of  <dig> in the luc images. comparison of luc images suggests that the strongest up-regulation of luc activity occurred at undifferentiated stage i in this line. the real-time observations strongly indicate a developmental regulation of the tagged promoter in this line. in contrast, all other lines, including the positive control line , showed a consistent decrease in luc activity throughout in vitro regeneration in all tissueswhen subjected to lt .

based on the direct correlation between the number of greyscale levels as detected by the ccd camera and the level of luc activity, lines were ranked at 26°c in five different classes: not detectable , weak , moderate , strong  and very strong . at each developmental stage real-time monitoring of luc activity took place while subjecting to lt at 8°c  and  <dig> h later luc activity was scored again. upward and downward-pointing arrows indicate an increase and decrease, respectively, relative to the luc activity at 26°c.

luc activity detected according to upper greyscale limit setting: not detectable  – less than  <dig>  weak  – between  <dig> and  <dig>  moderate  – between  <dig> and  <dig>  strong  – between  <dig> and  <dig> , very strong  – more than  <dig> .

more detailed quantitative time course analyses of luc activity were performed for tagged line  <dig> and the positive control line . calculation of the average luc activity at 8°c and 26°c  indicated for line  <dig> a  <dig> -fold and a  <dig> -fold increase in luc activity when lowering the temperature at stage i and ii, respectively and a  <dig> -fold decrease in luc activity at stage iii . in conclusion, as line  <dig> became more differentiated, less induction of luc activity occurred upon lt stress indicating developmental regulation of luc activity. in all screenings, luc activity reached a new steady-state level within two hours following the change in temperature, which suggests a very fast response of the tagged promoters to lt and demonstrates the suitability of the luc reporter gene system for kinetic real-time in planta studies in banana.

molecular characterization of tagged sequences
the number of t-dna fragments integrated in seven of the promoter tagged lines was determined by southern hybridization with a luc+-specific probe  and ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> with an average of  <dig>  t-dna inserts per line . to increase the success rate of isolating all 5'-tagged t-dna flanking sequences in multicopy lines, both thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr  with three degenerate primers and inverse pcr  with two restriction enzymes were performed. in tail-pcr, degenerate primer ad2- <dig> yielded less 5'-tagged sequences than the other two degenerate primers , while in i-pcr more 5'-tagged flanking sequences were obtained with bcli than with bsrgi . although usually different tagged sequences were obtained with the two walking methods, identical sequences were also retrieved in several lines , including tagged line  <dig> . the number of isolated 5'-tagged sequences corresponded well  with the number of t-dna insertions . sequence analysis revealed that one t-dna fragment was rearranged from the selectable marker gene cassette upstream to the luc+ gene in lines  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in addition, t-dna tandem repeats were identified in lines  <dig> and  <dig>  and vector backbone sequences were integrated in lines  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . despite these complex t-dna rearrangements, bla in these lines either remained stable or even increased throughout in vitro regeneration .

the minimum number of t-dna copies was determined by southern hybridization with a dig-labelled luc+ probe. isolation of 5'-tagged sequences was accomplished using three different arbitrary degenerated  primers in tail-pcr and two different restriction enzymes in i-pcr.

due to the relative strength and developmentally regulated pattern of luc activity under lt stress , line  <dig> was chosen for further molecular analysis. southern hybridizations demonstrated five luc+ inserts in line  <dig> . a comparison between the hybridization patterns obtained with the luc+ probe and the 5'-tagged sequence-specific probes  on the same blots revealed common fragments. for four of five luc+ inserts in line  <dig>  physical linkage with a cloned 5' region was established as shown in figure 2b. the fifth 5'-tagged region contained a vector backbone rearrangement and could not be linked to the remaining luc+ insert. for additional characterization, 3'-tagged regions were isolated with tail- and i-pcr either downstream of the left border in tagged line  <dig> and/or from cloned 5' sequences in untransformed plants. to find out which 3'-tagged sequence formed a continuous sequence with a cloned 5' region, 'linking' pcr was performed for each 5' region with all 3' sequence-specific primers . specific products with the calculated length were obtained both in untransformed control plants and in tagged plants of line  <dig> for four sequences in line  <dig> , which indicates sequence continuity between the corresponding isolated 5' and 3' regions . since tagged line  <dig> is hemizygous for the tags, the presence of pcr products with the same size as in the untransformed plant indicates amplification of the wild-type gene copies in tagged line  <dig>  amplification from the tagged loci was not expected under the pcr conditions applied as these contain  the whole t-dna  of petkul <dig> inserted, specificity of all pcr products in figure 2c was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing .

these results demonstrate that up- and downstream tagged sequences can be retrieved and linked in banana irrespective of the t-dna copy number. this is of primary importance when dealing with an interesting transgenic line because between 30%  <cit>  and 85%  of transgenic banana lines may contain more than one t-dna copy.

sequence and rt-pcr analysis of tagged regions in line 17
to search for the presence of promoter sequences within the tagged 5' regions, an in silico search for cis-acting elements was performed . indicated are the elements involved in drought and/or lt responses  expression region  <dig>  icer1) and abscisic acid responses , as well as candidate tata boxes. the  <dig>  kb sequence 17- <dig>  contains four dre-like, one icer1-like, and four abre elements, which is significantly more than any of the other 5'-tagged regions. two candidate tata boxes are located at positions - <dig> and - <dig> relative to the t-dna right border junction with all other elements upstream of them. additionally, a tata-less promoter sequence was identified in 17- <dig> with a corresponding candidate transcription start site at position - <dig>  as determined by the tssp software. the lack of homology to any available sequence in the databases for this 5'-tagged sequence plus the corresponding linked 3' region suggests that a cryptic promoter might be tagged in sequence 17- <dig>  only one dre-like element and two putative tata boxes were located in the  <dig>  kb sequence 17- <dig>  analysis of the corresponding  <dig>  kb 3'-tagged sequence revealed high homology over a length of  <dig> bp to a 596-bp banana est  indicating that the corresponding t-dna insertion had occurred in a coding region. this region shows homology to the last  <dig> amino acids of an unknown rice protein  and  <dig> amino acids of another unknown rice protein . the sequence of the specific  <dig> bp pcr product containing the linked 5' and 3' flanking regions  confirmed that the two flanks form one continuous sequence in the banana genome, but no homology was found to any known sequence. with the exception of two candidate tata boxes in sequence 17- <dig>  no other relevant promoter elements were identified in the two remaining 5'-tagged sequences 17- <dig> and 17- <dig>  and database searches did not reveal homology to any known sequence for these 5' regions and their linked 3' regions.

to find out which sequence activated the luc+ reporter gene in tagged line  <dig>  an rt-pcr approach was followed. first, rt-pcr of the housekeeping act gene demonstrated the absence of genomic dna in the cdna preparations . second, transcription of the luc+ gene clearly occurred in all in vitro plant tissues tested , which is in agreement with the real-time measurements at 26°c and developmental stage iii . third, rt-pcr reactions were performed with a primer binding within a distance of  <dig> to  <dig> bp from the rb t-dna junction of each of the four 5'-tagged sequences in combination with a luc+-specific primer. a product of the expected size  was obtained in all tissues tested but only for sequence 17- <dig> , confirming that this sequence is transcriptionally fused to the activated luc+ gene. the expected pcr signal of  <dig> bp was absent for sequence 17- <dig>  but appeared when rising the number of rt-pcr cycles from  <dig> to  <dig> showing that 17- <dig> weakly activates the luc+ gene as well. the identity of this rt-pcr product was also confirmed by hybridization with a 17- <dig> sequence specific probe . results from semi-quantitative rt-pcr on samples of proliferating material initiated from in vitro apical meristems of line  <dig> was consistent with these results  indicating that sequences 17- <dig> and 17- <dig> are also transcriptionally active in proliferating meristem cultures.

we also investigated transcription of all 3' tagged sequences of line  <dig> by rt-pcr in cell colonies  as well as leaf and root tissues of in vitro plants  of untransformed control lines . only the 3'-tagged sequence of insertion 17- <dig> was transcribed in the different tissues tested at 26°c and 8°c as shown by the expected rt-pcr signal of  <dig> bp , which corroborates the in silico analysis.

promoter activity of tagged sequence 17-1
to confirm promoter characteristics of tagged sequence 17- <dig>  two transcriptional fusions  of sequence 17- <dig> to the uida reporter gene were constructed and used for transformation of a commercial dessert banana variety. transient gus analysis of undifferentiated 'grand naine' suspension cells after  <dig> days of cocultivation revealed weak promoter activity of sequence 17- <dig> irrespective of its length compared to the positive control maize ubiquitin promoter . histochemical gus analysis of transgenic cell colonies  at 26°c after two months of selection showed promoter activity of sequence 17- <dig> , which confirms luc activity measurements in the original tagged line  <dig> . similar results were obtained with the  <dig> bp 3' truncation of sequence 17- <dig> . as expected, the activity of these sequences appeared lower than that of the positive control maize ubiquitin promoter . no background activity was detected in untransformed control cultures  or cultures transformed with the empty control vector pcambia-1391z .

lt responsiveness was evaluated by gus enzyme activity assays in cultures back-transformed with the full-length 17- <dig> sequence in stage i . similarly to the original tagged line  <dig>  a significant  increase by lt treatment was observed in stage i cell colonies, whereas cell colonies transformed with the control ubiquitin promoter exerted decreased gus expression .

activity of the 17- <dig> promoter sequence was further monitored throughout in vitro regeneration by histochemical gus staining . six months after transformation early differentiating stage ii cultures transformed with the full-length 17- <dig> sequence and 3' truncated sequence 17- <dig> stained blue  in agreement with the luc activity detected at this stage in the original tagged line  <dig> . a higher staining intensity was obtained with the full-length 17- <dig> sequence although it was still less than that in cultures transformed with the positive control ubiquitin promoter . no staining occurred in untransformed control cultures  or pcambia-1391z transformed cultures . twelve months after transformation, in stage iii in vitro plants, the full-length 17- <dig> promoter sequence  and its deletion variant  remained active in all tissues tested , with the full-length version still exhibiting higher activity. these activity patterns confirmed luc screening results of the original tagged line  <dig> as well as the aforementioned rt-pcr results. except for a slight coloration in pseudostem cross sections, no background staining was observed in untransformed control tissues  and pcambia-1391z transformed tissues .

in agreement with the real-time luc activity measurements in the regenerated  original tagged line  <dig>  gus enzymatic activity decreased by lt treatment both in leaf and root tissue of back-transformed line carrying the full-length 17- <dig> promoter sequence in one back-transformed line . in another line, however, the lt treatment did affect gus activity in leaf tissue, while it caused a slight increase in gus activity in root tissue . a tissue dependent reaction of the maize ubiquitin promoter in the regenerated positive control line was also detected. more specifically, an upregulation of gus activity occurred in leaf tissue, whereas in root tissue gus activity was downregulated . similar to cell colony stage i, the full-length 17- <dig> promoter sequence was less active than the maize ubiquitin promoter in stage iii regenerated plants at both temperatures and tissues tested.

discussion
a combination of the improved t-dna tagging vector petkul <dig>  <cit>  and detailed real-time monitoring of in vitro activated luc expression has allowed us to tag banana promoters and monitor their activation during in vitro regeneration. three months after agrobacterium infection of embryogenic suspension cells, high-throughput screening for promoter activated lines was started at cell colony stage and repeated at subsequent in vitro regenerative stages. both qualitative scoring and quantitative measurements using image analysis software revealed an enhanced luc activity under lt  stress during early undifferentiated developmental stages in two  out of  <dig> lt-responsive lines. this result demonstrates reliability of the simple and fast qualitative scoring of recorded images, and suggests developmental regulation of lt upregulation of the tagged promoters in these lines. the latter conclusion is further corroborated by recapitulation of the lt upregulated luc activity profile in similar cell colony cultures that were re-initiated via proliferation  <cit>  from apical meristems of in vitro multiplied plants of line  <dig> . to the best of our knowledge, no comparable real-time monitoring of t-dna tagged cultures from undifferentiated cells until in vitro plants have been performed so far. usually, only a specific phase of plant development was investigated, such as embryo development  <cit> , seedling development  <cit> , flowering  <cit>  or lateral root development  <cit> . similarly, lt upregulation has previously been studied either at a specific stage of development  <cit>  or in certain tissue explants  <cit>  but not in real-time and in planta throughout the whole plant regeneration process.

since it is known that light intensity of the luc reaction measured in solution decreases upon lowering the temperature  <cit> , we hypothesize that non-lt responsive promoters are tagged in banana lines that show a similar decreased in vivo luc activity when exposed to identical temperature regimes. developmentally regulated promoters might, however, still be tagged in these cases as indicated by variable luc levels emitted at 26°c throughout regeneration . on the other hand, the observed bla profiles of tagged lines might also be the result of regulation by one or more tissue culture components rather than simply by the developmental program during in vitro regeneration. bade et al.  <cit>  addressed this issue in promoter tagged brassica napus lines and found that  <dig> out of  <dig> tagged promoters with callus-specific activity were also auxin upregulated. interpretation of such results, however, will be difficult in practice because other components of the different media may also influence gene expression.

t-dna promoter and gene tagging studies in model plants usually yield an average of one to two t-dna copies per transgenic line  <cit> . southern analysis of seven promoter tagged banana lines showed an average of  <dig>  t-dna copies per line. because this makes isolation and identification of the activating 5'-tagged region laborious and time consuming, single t-dna copy integrations are usually preferentially analyzed  <cit> . because of the low incidence of single copy t-dna insertions in banana tagged lines, we demonstrate here that activated insertion can be identified in multicopy t-dna mutants. the combination of i-pcr and tail-pcr yielded the expected number of flanking sequences in the majority of lines) highlighting the usefulness of pcr walking techniques with different principles of operation for retrieval of the flanking sequences in multicopy t-dna lines.

in silico analysis of the four 5'-tagged candidate promoter sequences in line  <dig> suggested that two promoters had been tagged. one t-dna insertion  tagged a cryptic promoter since transcription of the corresponding 3'-tagged sequence in untransformed control tissues was absent both at developmental stage i and stage iii, while the 5'-tagged 17- <dig> sequence displayed promoter activity following back-transformation . tagging of cryptic promoters, i.e. regulatory elements that are inactive at their native genomic positions but become functional upon adjacent insertion of genes, is not uncommon in plants and some of them also appear tissue-specific  <cit> . high homology of part of the downstream sequence to a banana est and the last  <dig> amino acids of an unknown rice protein suggested that the other t-dna insertion  occurred in a coding region. rt-pcr using primers specific for the 3'-tagged sequence of this insertion to detect transcription in tissues of stage i and stage iii untransformed lines confirmed this finding. moreover, the lack of transcription of the 3'-tagged sequences of insertions 17- <dig> and 17- <dig> in stage i cell colonies at 25°c and 8°c also strongly suggests that their corresponding 5'-tagged sequences did not contribute to the lt upregulated luc activity in the original tagged line  <dig>  finally, using rt-pcr analysis we confirmed that both 5'-tagged sequences 17- <dig> and 17- <dig> activate the luc+ gene, albeit to a different level with sequence 17- <dig> being the most active. this opens the possibility that promoter 17- <dig> is responsible for lt upregulation in undifferentiated cell cultures, while baseline luc activity might be caused by activity of promoter 17- <dig> .

histochemical gus analyses of back-transformed lines demonstrated that sequence 17- <dig> possesses promoter activity throughout in vitro regeneration and in all banana tissues tested. whether this promoter remains active in mature plants will be investigated. since the maize ubiquitin promoter is highly active in banana  <cit> , it was expected that the 17- <dig> promoter would be weaker than the ubiquitin promoter as revealed by differential staining intensity of gus assays. the results also demonstrated that sequence 17- <dig>  originally isolated from an african plantain-type banana, is also functional in the commercial dessert banana 'grand naine'. these results are encouraging in view of generating cisgenic plants. the full-length sequence 17- <dig> was more active than the 3' truncated sequence suggesting that the  <dig> bp 3' truncation harbours elements that are essential for promoter strength but not the core functional elements. on the other hand, no other functional elements were likely removed since the deletion did not affect the expression pattern of this promoter.

with a more than 2-fold increase in gus activity after a  <dig> h treatment at 8°c the expression pattern of the original tagged line  <dig> under lt stress at cell colony stage i was recapitulated in the back-transformed lines carrying the full-length 17- <dig> promoter sequence. this level of induction at 8°c is lower than in the original tagged line  <dig>  and might be caused by stability of the gus enzyme . in regenerated in vitro plants , the decrease in luc expression observed in the original tagged line  <dig> under lt stress  was also detected by gus enzyme activity assays in one out of two back-transformed lines carrying the full-length 17- <dig> promoter sequence irrespective of the tissue tested. a position effect might contribute to the different activity pattern of the 17- <dig> sequence in the other back-transformed line. nevertheless, these results support the aforementioned histochemical data that the full-length 17- <dig> sequence has promoter activity in all tissues tested at stage iii. the almost 2-fold decrease in gus activity in the positive control cell colonies under lt stress might be attributed to an inhibiting effect of lt on the maize ubiquitin promoter activity. a similar and consistent 2- to 4-fold lower gus activity at 4°c than at 24°c in wheat leaves controlled by the maize ubiquitin promoter has been reported  <cit> . in contrast, exposure of two stably transformed  rice callus lines to freezing  resulted in an approximately 3-fold increased gus expression  <cit> . moreover, in the control transgenic line tested at regenerated plant stage iii in this work, the maize ubiquitin promoter showed an opposite reaction to lt stress in different tissues. lt conditions and tissue type may therefore play an important role in the induction or suppression of the maize ubiquitin promoter, which also warrants further investigation on the activation of promoter sequence 17- <dig> in different tissues under different lt conditions. the same putative cis-regulatory dre and abre elements found in the maize ubiquitin promoter  <cit>  and present in several lt-responsive promoters  <cit>  were also identified in promoter sequence 17- <dig> and could contribute to increased expression observed during the lt treatment.

in summary, we have devised and applied a real-time in vitro screening platform for the identification of promoter-tagged cultures as well as for the isolation of an lt-responsive promoter in banana. this or a similar system can be employed in any plant species with a comparable in vitro regeneration procedure  because homogeneous cell or tissue cultures can be reliably and uniformly induced, for example, by temperature or a chemical treatment. the presented platform could be an important tool for screening other traits and finding genes that are induced by a broad range of factors, possibly including high temperature, oxidative stress , salt/osmotic or drought stress, as well as elicitors or toxins. by appropriate modifications in tagging constructs the same platform can also be useful in other functional genomics strategies such as activation tagging.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated here that a high-throughput real-time luciferase-based screening system is valuable for tagging novel promoters and genes in banana and to follow their expression pattern throughout in vitro development and lt treatment. in addition, with the aid of combined pcr techniques we were able to identify and isolate the activated insertions in a multicopy t-dna line. histochemical gus analyses of back-transformed cell cultures of a different, commercial cultivar demonstrated that the isolated sequence 17- <dig> possesses a reproducible promoter activity pattern. thus, this promoter represents a useful tool for regulated in vitro expression of foreign genes and might be employed during generation of commercial transgenic plants.
