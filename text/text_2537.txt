BACKGROUND
a class of biological circuits was recently described with robust input-output relations  <cit> . in these systems, the output, such as the concentration or activity of a specific protein, is perfectly insensitive to variations in the concentrations of all of the system's components, and yet responsive to the system's input. such robust input-output relations are difficult to achieve, because in most conceivable mechanisms the output is sensitive to variations in the concentrations of the circuit components.

at the heart of these robust mechanisms are bifunctional enzymes that catalyze two opposing reactions. the first example analyzed in detail appears in bacterial two-component signaling systems, in which a bifunctional receptor confers a robust input-output relationship by acting as both a kinase and a phosphatase of a response-regulator protein  <cit> . a second case of a bifunctional enzyme tied to robustness was studied in the glyoxylate bypass control of e. coli metabolism, in which the activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase is made robust by a bifunctional kinase/phosphatase  <cit> . a third example appears in the nitrogen assimilation system of e. coli, in which glutamine synthetase is controlled by a bifunctional enzyme that both adenylates and de-adenylates it  <cit> .

although all of these systems rely on bifunctional enzymes, each system does so with important differences. thus, robustness relies in each case on the biochemical details of the system. in the two-component signaling case, robustness relies on an auto-kinase and phosphotransfer reaction by the receptor, as well as on the receptor phosphatase reaction being atp-dependent. in the case of the glyoxylate bypass, robustness depends on saturating one of the sites of the bifunctional enzyme with substrate. and in the nitrogen assimilation case, robustness depends on avidity of the bifunctional enzyme to its multimeric substrate. thus, in each case studied so far, there is a different detailed mechanism for robustness.

it is therefore of interest to describe additional systems with bifunctional enzymes, in order to discover new potential mechanisms for robustness. here, we consider the plant carbon fixation cycle which employs a bifunctional kinase/phosphatase. the wealth of unusual biochemical features in this system makes it an interesting candidate for seeking a new mechanism for robustness. we next describe the reactions in this system and evidence for its robustness. we then propose a putative model for how robustness in this system can arise based on its biochemical architecture.

c <dig> plants such as corn and sugarcane use an enzymatic cycle to promote the assimilation of atmospheric co <dig> into biomass. a key step in this cycle is the conversion of pyruvate to pep by the enzyme pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase   <cit> . the activity of ppdk, namely the rate of pep production, is controlled by light . light level is encoded in the cell by the concentration of adp: high adp means low light, and low adp means high light . for simplicity, we will consider adp levels as the input of the system, and pep formation rate as its output.

the c <dig> pathway has three main types, two of which decarboxilate malate to pyruvate  and then utilize ppdk as a crucial enzyme in the co <dig> assimilation cycle  <cit> . plants that employ these two types include maize, sugarcane, sorghum and millet. the third c <dig> type has the ppdk enzyme , but also has an additional decarboxylation pathway through pepck  which transforms oxaloacetate to pep. in this third c <dig> pathway type, ppdk may be less crucial than in the first two types  <cit> .

ppdk is one of the most abundant enzymes in the biosphere  <cit> , constituting about 7-10% of the protein content of mesophyll cells  <cit> . it is maximally active as a homotetramer. when subjected to cold temperatures it dissociates into dimers and monomers, making it mostly inactive.

the reactions and regulation of ppdk have the following biochemical features . ppdk catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to pep in two steps: the first is auto-phosphorylation at a his residue . the second step is a phospho-transfer reaction that transfers the phosphoryl to pyruvate to produce pep. the autokinase reaction takes two phosphoryl groups from atp and in the presence of pi produces ppdk <dig>  amp and ppi. the two reactions are thus:

  atp+pi+ppdk0→amp+ppi+ppdk <dig> 

  pyruvate+ppdk1→pep+ppdk <dig> 

to regulate the activity of ppdk there exists a second phosphorylation/de-phosphorylation cycle. the auto-phosphorylated form of ppdk, ppdk <dig>  can be phosphorylated a second time at a thr residue. this doubly-phosphorylated form is an inactive form of the enzyme . a bi-functional enzyme called regulatory protein  catalyzes two opposing reactions: phosphorylation uses adp as a substrate and its products are ppdk <dig> and amp

  ppdk1+adp→ppdk2+amp 

whereas dephosphorylation uses inorganic phosphate pi to produce ppi:

  ppdk2+pi→ppdk1+ppi 

the two phosphorylation steps of ppdk are sequential, meaning that the second phosphorylation of ppdk at the thr residue can happen only on the auto-phosphorylated form ppdk <dig>  i.e. only after ppdk is in its active form and ready to phosphorylate pyruvate to produce pep  <cit> . the bifunctional enzyme rp is inhibited in a competitive manner by ppi  <cit> .

a recent experimental study indicates that the activity of ppdk <dig>  is insensitive to variations in ppdk protein levels  <cit> . ohta et al. transformed a cold-tolerant ppdk gene into maize. the transformation yielded  <dig> strains each with a different expression level of ppdk. the strains were then measured for ppdk enzyme activity. these measurements show that enzyme activity is nearly insensitive to increasing or decreasing ppdk expression levels: there was only about a 20% change of pep formation rate despite a  <dig>  fold variation in ppdk levels  <cit>  . this suggests that ppdk activity is regulated in a way to ensure a robust pep formation rate . the nature of this mechanism remains unknown.

in this study, we demonstrate that the detailed features of the system can work together to provide input-output robustness. we propose a mechanism that makes the output  robust to wide variations in the concentration of all of the system components, including protein levels  and substrate metabolite levels . despite this robustness, the rate of pep formation is still sensitive to its input signal adp which corresponds to photosynthetic activity . the mechanism proposed in this study is based on avidity of the bifunctional enzyme rp to ppdk tetramers. it also depends on a product-inhibition feedback effect of a ppdk product  on rp's catalytic rates. we also detail the conditions in which robustness breaks down, such as extreme values of the input adp, or ultra-low levels of substrates or proteins.

RESULTS
a mechanism based on bifunctional enzyme avidity and product inhibition suggests robustness of pep formation rate
we present a mechanism for robustness in the system based on its known biochemical features. the outline is as follows: we first note that the tetramer structure of ppdk makes possible an avidity effect, in which rp primarily acts when it is bound at the same time to two different monomers on the same tetramer. we then show that this avidity effect allows the system to reach steady-state only if the specific rates of the kinase and phosphatase reactions of rp are exactly equal. finally, we note that such tuning of specific rates is made possible by a feedback loop, in which the rate of pep formation affects rp rates by product-inhibition . the upshot is that the pep formation rate  depends only on the input signal , and not on any of the protein levels , levels of metabolite substrates  or on ppdk catalytic rate. the full set of equations of the mechanism is shown in additional file  <dig>  the following description aims to allow an intuitive understanding of the mechanism.

the avidity effect in rp action
we denote the non-phosphorylated form of ppdk by ppdk <dig>  the phosphorylated form at the his residue by ppdk <dig> and the doubly phosphorylated form at the his and thr residues by ppdk <dig>  only ppdk <dig> is active and catalyzes the production of pep.

the bifunctional enzyme rp has two domains, one for kinase and the other for phosphatase activity  <cit> . this two-domain structure, together with the tetrameric form of its substrate ppdk, provides for a cooperative binding effect known as the avidity effect. avidity results when one domain of rp, the kinase domain, binds a ppdk <dig> subunit and the other domain binds a ppdk <dig> subunit on the same tetramer.

we name the situation where rp simultaneously binds two ppdk subunits as the ternary complex, . the situation where rp binds only one domain is termed a binary complex. the binary complexes are  and . thus, at steady-state, the total rp kinase activity equals the rp phosphatase activity, and includes the contribution of both binary and ternary complexes

  vk==vp 

where vk and vp are the specific catalytic activities of the two domains of rp. these rates depend on the input adp  <cit> .

due to the avidity effect, however, the ternary complex is highly favored relative to binary complexes. once rp binds one subunit of ppdk, for example ppdk <dig>  the effective local concentration of a neighboring subunit  is increased. as a result, the on-rate for the second binding is very high . unbinding is rare, because both subunits need to unbind at the same time for rp to leave the tetramer.

avidity therefore ensures that, as long as both ppdk <dig> and ppdk <dig> forms are present on the same tetramer, the ternary complex is the prevalent complex in the system . as a result, both phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation catalyzed by rp occur mainly in the ternary complex. this applies also in a more detailed model, presented in the last section of the results, that takes into account the spatial organization of the three possible states of ppdk subunits along the tetramer. thus, we assume that, as a first approximation, we can neglect the binary complexes in eq., to find that the condition for steady-state is equality between the rates catalyzed by ternary complexes:

  vk=vp 

when the ternary complex level is non-zero, one can cancel it out from both sides of the equation. this means that steady-state requires equal specific kinase and phosphatase rates for the bifunctional enzyme rp:

  vk=vp 

this is a requirement that cannot generally be met, because the input signal adp changes vk and vp in opposite directions . thus, steady state requires an additional layer of regulation. we next describe an effect due to product inhibition, which can satisfy the steady-state condition, and turns out to provide robustness.

tuning of rp velocities can be achieved through a product-inhibition feedback loop
note that the products of the auto-kinase reaction of ppdk, amp and ppi, are also the products of the rp reactions: amp is the product of the kinase reaction, and ppi the product of the phosphatase reaction. in the present view, these features can help to form a robust mechanism, because they provide a feedback loop between ppdk and rp activities. this feedback is due to the phenomenon of product inhibition  <cit>  of rp. the phosphatase activity of rp has been found to be inhibited by its product ppi, following a michaelis-menten like inhibition curve  <cit> 

  vp=vp0∕ 

where ki,ppi =  <dig> μm is the inhibition constant  <cit>  and vp <dig> is the maximal phosphatase velocity. thus, the more ppi in the cell, the lower is the phosphatase activity of rp. experiments suggest that the kinase reaction of rp is not measurably inhibited by the second product amp .

since ppi is produced by ppdk, and inhibits rp, it can link these two enzyme activities. for this to happen, however, the concentration of ppi in these cells must be determined mainly by ppdk, and not by the hundred or so other reactions that produce ppi  <cit> . the situation in these plant cells might be special, however, because of the huge amount of ppdk enzyme . we therefore assume that the main production source of ppi is the ppdk auto-kinase activity, and neglect to a first approximation all other ppi sources . the concentration of ppi in such a case is given by the balance of its production rate by the ppdk <dig> auto-kinase reaction, f <dig>  and its degradation at rate α

  dppi∕dt=f1-αppi 

solving this results in a steady-state concentration of ppi that is proportional to the production rate from the auto-kinase reaction ,  = f1/α. this is important because at steady-state each auto-kinase reaction corresponds to one pep formation reaction: the phosphate is transferred from ppdk onto pyruvate to produce pep. because of this stoichiometric relationship, the system output, pep formation rate f <dig>  is equal to the production rate of ppi from the auto-kinase: f2= f <dig>  these considerations link the pep formation rate, f <dig>  to the ppi concentration,

  f2=αppi 

using this relation in eq., we see that product inhibition of rp by  leads to the following connection between the systems output f <dig> and the rp phosphate rate:

  vp=vp0∕ 

where f <dig> = α ki,ppi. this closes a negative feedback loop: the higher the pep formation rate f <dig>  the lower the phosphatase activity of rp, and thus the more ppdk in its inactive form ppdk <dig>  leading to lower pep formation rate . this loop leads the pep formation rate to a point at which the rp kinase and phosphatase activities are equal ). using eq., we find that this steady state pep formation rate is

  f <dig> st.st=f*=α ki,ppi∕vk-1) 

this is the main result of the present analysis. the output formation rate f* does not depend on the concentrations of the proteins in the system, rp and ppdk. it also does not depend on any of the substrate metabolites, atp, pyruvate, pep and amp. the formation rate is thus robust to these potentially fluctuating concentrations as been also suggested by studies in leaves and isolated chloroplasts showing no clear relation between ppdk activity and changes in atp, amp, pyruvate and pep levels . despite this robustness, the output rate is controlled by the input signal adp, which corresponds to light levels.

the magnitude of the output  in this mechanism is given by the product of the ppi product-inhibition constant and the ppi degradation rate, f <dig> = α ki,ppi. we note that pyrophosphatases are abundant in the chloroplast  <cit> , providing a fast hydrolysis specific activity of  <dig> μmol/mg chl/min  <cit> , yielding α ≈ <dig> . since ki,ppi =  <dig> μm  <cit>  one finds a rate of about f <dig> =  <dig> reactions/second per chloroplast . this rate magnitude makes sense: the c <dig> cycle in these plant cells assimilates about 107- <dig> carbon atoms in the form of co <dig> per second per chloroplast at daylight  <cit>  .

limits of robustness
we also studied the conditions in which robustness might break down. the model suggests three cases: the first potential condition for loss of robustness is when there is not enough total ppdk enzyme or substrates to provide the robust rate f* of eq.. the second includes conditions of very low or very high input signal, in which the binary complexes in eq. cannot be neglected, and avidity is no longer a dominant effect. the third condition for loss of robustness occurs when total ppdk levels are extremely high such that its activity cannot be regulated due to shortage in the phosphorylation substrate . we now briefly analyze these conditions.

the first type of conditions in which robustness does not occur is when there is not enough total ppdk enzyme or substrates  to provide the robust pep formation rate f* given by eq.. for example, if substrate or ppdk levels are zero, one must have f <dig> =  <dig>  solution of the model shows that when one of these factors  goes below a threshold concentration , all of ppdk becomes active . the formation rate f <dig> is then linear in ppdk <dig>  f <dig> = v <dig> ppdk <dig>  in this state, the rate depends on protein and metabolite levels and robustness is lost. as soon as ppdk and/or substrate levels become high enough to reach f*, robustness is restored .

the second case for loss of robustness is extreme input levels in which the binary complexes are not negligible compared to ternary complexes. avidity requires that ppdk exist on the same tetramer in both ppdk <dig> and ppdk <dig> forms. however, in extreme high or low signal  levels, this does not apply. in these conditions, one can no longer neglect the effects of binary complexes . at very low adp levels , most ppdk is active and ppdk <dig> monomers are rare. ternary complexes are scarce because they require ppdk <dig> 

we estimate that robustness begins to erode at light levels below  <dig> μe m- <dig> s- <dig> or above  <dig> μe m- <dig> s- <dig>  which is also the mean photosynthetic photon flux at daylight  <cit> . thus robustness is found between an upper and lower bounds on the light input , as illustrated in figures  <dig> and  <dig> 

robustness also breaks down at an extreme case when total ppdk levels exceed adp concentration , a condition that physiologically cannot be met due to the very high levels of this protein. in this case, cellular adp levels are too low to allow further phosphorylation of the excess ppdk <dig>  consequently, the rate of pep formation will be linearly dependent on ppdk total amounts .

we also note that to be feasible, the robust mechanism must admit a positive and stable solution. exact solution of the model shows that this corresponds to the condition vk < vp <dig>  namely that the rp kinase rate is smaller than the phosphatase maximal rate .

a model for the spatial arrangement of ppdk subunits based on avidity predicts a bimodal distribution of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated tetramers
finally we analyze the detailed configurations of ppdk states within ppdk tetramers, when the robust mechanism is active. the robust mechanism involves the rp cycle catalyzed primarily by rp bound to two adjacent subunits of ppdk, one in ppdk <dig> form and the other in ppdk <dig> form. the abundance of this ternary complex relative to binary complexes is due to the avidity effect.

when rp carries out a reaction, it changes the state of one of the two subunits that it binds: changing ppdk <dig> to ppdk <dig> or vice verse. it thus converts adjacent ppdk1- ppdk <dig> subunits either to two adjacent ppdk <dig> subunits, or two adjacent ppdk <dig> subunits.

the action of rp therefore tends to convert neighboring subunits that have different forms to the same form. analyzing this in a detailed model that tracks the different configurations of tetramers , we find that the dynamics reaches a steady-state in which the configuration distribution resembles a bimodal distribution. in this distribution, tetramers tend to be made of all ppdk <dig> or all ppdk <dig> subunits . these forms are slowly converted to other forms by rp binding to a single monomer . the rarest forms are those with adjacent ppdk1- ppdk <dig> states, arranged in a "checkerboard" pattern. a quantitative analysis of the configuration probability distribution and its effect on the ratio of ternary to binary reactions is presented at the methods section.

we also studied the effect of a three-state model on the different configurations, with  <dig> possible states for ppdk subunits, namely ppdk <dig>  ppdk <dig> and ppdk <dig>  we find that for the system to attain robustness it is beneficial that the two steps of the phospho-transfer have different rates. only if the auto-phosphorylation of ppdk is faster than the phospho-transfer to pyruvate, the majority of the ppdk pool will transition between the ppdk <dig> and ppdk <dig> states and the ternary complex will dominate the modification reactions. otherwise, the majority of the configurations will be in the ppdk <dig> state which hampers the probability for a ternary complex to exist. in-vitro measurements suggest that the auto-phosphorylation reaction is  <dig>  faster than the phospho-transfer reaction  <cit> . we find that this is sufficient for the avidity reactions to dominate the process, and for robustness to result.

discussion
we presented a putative mechanism for robustness in the ppdk system of the c <dig> pathway in plants. the mechanism depends on avidity of the bifunctional enzyme rp to its multimeric substrate ppdk, and on a product-inhibition feedback loop that couples the system output pep formation rate to the activity of the bifunctional regulator. the resulting output, pep formation rate, is made insensitive to variations in substrates and protein levels. despite this robustness, the output formation rate can be tuned by the input of the system, light levels encoded by adp concentration.

robust control of pep formation rate in the c <dig> cycle might be important in order to synchronize its action with the photosynthesis rate. the c <dig> pathway allows plants to increase their internal co <dig> concentration near the carbon fixing apparatus. good regulation can ensure an optimal balance of resources in the plant and help avoid reactive oxygen species accumulation  <cit> .

robustness is predicted to break down at very high or very low light levels, or when ppdk concentration or the concentrations of its substrates are too low to provide the robust solution. in these cases the output formation rate becomes proportional to ppdk levels and catalytic activity. darkness leads to a shutdown of pep production  to match the lack of photosynthesis. shortage in substrates or ppdk enzyme leads to maximal activity of ppdk  <cit> ).

our model also predicts that the robust rate solution f*  does not depend on the catalytic rate of ppdk. thus, the pep formation rate can be insensitive to temperature effects on ppdk specific activity. this feature of the model may explain the robust activity of ppdk observed in maize across temperatures from 28°c to 45°c  <cit> .

one interesting question raised by the present finding is why should each cell be robust, when there are so many cells in the plant tissue that errors might be averaged away? a robust pep formation rate in each mesophyll cell, despite the fluctuations averaging ability of the entire tissue, suggests that each cell may require the optimal rate level at each given conditions. being above or below this optimal level may cause damage to the cell, or reduce its growth ability. for example, atp is needed both for carbon fixation and for biosynthesis. an unnecessary consumption of atp by an error of too much c <dig> cycle carbon fixation rate could hamper biosynthesis. similarly, reduced pep formation rate  would reduce carbon fixation rate and therefore cell growth. because of such effects, fluctuations at the single cell level may not average out but rather decrease the fitness of the entire tissue.

the ppdk mechanism is readily testable by experiments that test pep formation rate as a function of enzyme and substrate levels in plants. experiments can also test the breakdown of robustness predicted at extreme light levels and very low levels of enzyme or substrates. one can also test the importance of avidity by studying mutant mono-functional versions of the bifunctional enzyme rp  <cit> . more generally, the suggested mechanism provides a context for the unusual set of biochemical features in this system. when considered together, these features have the potential to perform a systems level function: providing robustness with respect to fluctuating components and at the same time responsiveness to the input signal.

CONCLUSIONS
the presented ppdk mechanism is a new way to achieve robustness using product inhibition as a feedback loop on a bifunctional regulatory enzyme. this mechanism exhibits robustness, being insensitive to variations in protein and metabolite levels as well as to catalytic rate changes. at the same time, the output of the system remains tuned to input levels.
