BACKGROUND
epigenetic marks superimposed on the dna sequence of eukaryote chromosomes have the potential to provide agility and plasticity in terms of modulating gene expression, ontology, and response to the environment. these marks affect chromatin structure, and include cytosine methylation of dna and modifications to histone proteins. epialleles have been detected and characterised at specific loci in several plant systems, resulting from variation at specific sites or in global patterns of dna methylation or as histone variants  <cit> . some de novo epialleles can confer novel heritable phenotypes over several generations  <cit> . an increasing body of evidence indicates that many crop agronomic traits are likely to be affected to some extent by stably inherited epigenetic modifications  <cit> .

the extent to which inadvertent selection of epiallelic variation has contributed to the major increases in crop yield or quality achieved through selective breeding over the past century remains a mystery. although epialleles have the potential to generate novel and relatively stable phenotypes  <cit> , to date there have been no systematic attempts to explore and utilise epiallelic variation, and so extend the range of phenotypes available for selection in crop improvement. the scope for harnessing epigenetic variation is demonstrated by recent findings of an association between dna methylation and selection for energy use efficiency in brassica oilseed crops  <cit> , as well as the interaction between phosphate starvation response in arabidopsis and the pattern of histone h2a.z epigenetic marks  <cit> . h2a.z is excluded from sites of heavy dna methylation in actively transcribed genes  <cit> . tissue-specific monoallelic de novo dna methylation at the sp <dig> gene within the brassica rapa pollen self-incompatibility locus s has been shown to contribute to dominance relationships amongst s-alleles  <cit> . in arabidopsis, imprinted states mediated by changes in dna methylation and histone chemistry affect vernalisation and flowering time  <cit> , embryo development  <cit>  and seed size  <cit> .

dna methylation is regulated by a set of genes that directly catalyse the methylation process or indirectly influence methylation status via chromatin remodelling. in mammals and other metazoans this is primarily achieved through the activity of dna methyltransferase  <dig>  which encodes the enzyme responsible for 5mc maintenance, and domains rearrange methylase  <dig>  which encodes enzymes responsible for de novo methylation at cg sites. plants differ in the targets, distribution and transmission of dna methylation compared with animals. the arabidopsis dna methyltranferase  <dig>  is required for catalysing cytosine methylation in cg context, resulting in 5mcg  <cit> , whereas the chromatin remodelling factor decrease in dna methylation  <dig>  is required for maintaining dna methylation both at cg and chg sites  <cit> .

specific patterns of dna methylation can be transmitted through mitosis and cell lineages, as well as transgenerationally through meiosis, mediated by met <dig> <cit> . the stability of epiallelic variation has been demonstrated in a number of plant systems, including brassica napus <cit> . in arabidopsis, epirils have been established with variation and high heritability for flowering time and plant height, as well as stable inheritance of multiple parental dna methylation variants over at least eight generations  <cit> . subsequent phenotyping has demonstrated heritable variation for many fitness traits  <cit> . whole genome analysis of dna methylation in arabidopsis has shown that cg sites tend to be targeted within coding sequences  <cit> . more recently, it has been found that these marks appear preferentially associated with exons  <cit> .

one approach to generating novel epialleles is by perturbation of the dna methylation status  <cit> . this may include ectopic, tissue-specific or induced silencing of dna methyltransferases and other methylation regulators in the genome. in arabidopsis, down-regulation of met <dig> results in a wide range of abnormal phenotypes, including decreased plant stature, smaller rounded leaves, decreased fertility and reduced apical dominance  <cit> . although this has provided valuable insights into the role of cytosine methylation  in gene function and development, there are drawbacks to employing met <dig> mutants in the context of crop improvement, due to the widespread re-patterning of epigenetic marks within the genome. however, as with conventional functional gene analysis, there is potential to reveal a range of variants that may underpin epigenetic modulation of specific genes or traits. such an approach would be facilitated by exploring a range of epialleles associated with specific target genes  or phenotypic traits .

targeted chemical intervention, using demethylating agents such as 5-azacytidine , provides an alternative to transgenic or mutant modulation of met <dig>  5-azac is a structural analogue of the nucleoside cytidine with nitrogen atoms in place of carbon in the fifth position of the ring structure  <cit> . it is a potent inhibitor of dna methyltransferases and has been shown to be effective in reverting the hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes and suppressing cancer-specific cellular phenotypes  <cit> . since 5-azac interferes with met <dig>  there is a selective targeting of 5mcg, which in plants is associated with exonic dna. the use of 5-azac has a number of advantages over direct down-regulation of met <dig>  including potential for stochastic hypomethylation of target sites, rather than widespread hypomethylation that may mask more subtle and valuable phenotypes, or result in lethal epialleles. this presents the opportunity to screen for specific epialleles that may then be stably introgressed into a wild type background. naturally occurring epialleles have recently been shown to occur in near-isogenic lines of maize and to exhibit relatively stable inheritance  <cit> .

epigenetic intervention through generation of novel epialleles may be particularly tractable in the many crop plants of polyploid origin, where there is additional scope for paralogue- or homoeologue-specific gene regulation. the ability to sustain non-lethal variation is evident from the higher mutant loads attainable in ems tilling populations for b. rapa <cit> , b. napus <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . species within the genus brassica have been domesticated into a remarkably wide range of vegetable, oilseed, fodder and condiment crops  <cit> , including turnips, chinese cabbage, pak choi, brocolleto, sarson and turnip rape of b. rapa  and cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, brussels sprout of b. oleracea . the a genome is retained essentially intact within the amphidiploids of b. napus  giving rise to the major crops oilseed rape, canola and swede/rutabaga and mustard rape/brown mustard of b. juncea . it remains unclear why brassica species have the capacity to generate such a wide range of morphological forms, although this has been attributed to gene duplication, intergenomic heterozygosity and epigenetic phenomenon  <cit> . in the absence of direct evidence from whole genome bisulphite sequencing, estimates of 5mc methylation within brassica have been based on immunoprecipitation, giving estimates of 16% of all cytosines within the genome  <cit> , and methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism  giving estimates from 16-57% of target sites  <cit> .

here, we demonstrate the potential of stochastic chemically induced hypomethylation to generate novel and valuable variation for crop improvement. we systematically optimise the phenotypic dose–response to 5-azac in b. rapa and demonstrate the transgenerational inheritance of some phenotypes. we then use this information to generate a stochastically hypomethylated population which was selfed and characterised for a number of agronomic traits including seed size and composition. we demonstrate changes in the distribution of 5mc in euchromatin of pachytene stage chromosomes, variation in msap profiles and alterations in the transcriptome. the approach and populations developed are available for forward and reverse screening of epiallelic variation and subsequent functional and inheritance studies.

RESULTS
plants phenotypes have a sigmoidal dose–response to 5-azac hypomethylation
dosage response of the plants was investigated after exposure to various concentrations of 5-azac  during seed imbibition by examination of a range of phenotypic traits during plant development.

germination of e <dig> seed was not significantly affected  after being imbibed in 5-azac at concentrations up to  <dig> mm, although there was a small but significant decline  following exposure to  <dig> mm . during the early stages of development, there were clear differences in gross phenotype in terms of stature and rate of growth . plant growth was markedly stunted at concentrations of 5-azac above  <dig> mm . in some seedlings that failed to develop true leaves, root development was poor and plant stature conspicuously reduced.

there was a significant effect on days to first anthesis , at  <dig>  mm and above . in general, there was an increase in days to flowering with increasing concentrations of 5-azac. the variance in days to flowering also increased with 5-azac concentration. reduced pollen productivity and increased incidence of defective anthers was observed at higher 5-azac concentrations, although all plants with seemingly viable pollen were able to set at least some seeds. however, there was an overall reduction in seed set and seed weight associated with increased 5-azac concentration .

response of b. rapa seed set  and seed weight  to 5-azac treatment. plants were grown from seeds treated with different concentrations of 5-azac  and a control. seeds were harvested from nominated positions  of randomly selected e <dig> plants. a total of  <dig> plants in each concentration, consisting of four replications  were used for this analysis. the data were analysed by anova and the table shows the mean, standard error of the mean, variance of observations, the standard error of the difference  between means and the degrees of freedom .

the effect of 5-azac exposure also carried forward into the seminal generation. there was a small but significant  reduction in e <dig> seed germination; down to 92% at concentrations of  <dig>  mm 5-azac and above. compared to plants from control seeds where anthesis occurred at  <dig> days, there was also a reduction of  <dig>  days  to first anthesis in a subset of e <dig> plants at  <dig>  mm 5-azac. some e <dig> plants also exhibited chlorophyll sectoring.

careful analysis of two dose–response curves  allowed selection of optimal concentrations of 5-azac to generate a hypomethylated population in b. rapa . there was no significant  lack of fit of the data for either of these curves. this test was based on a total of  <dig> observations for data in figure 1a , and  <dig> observations for data in figure 1b . a concentration of  <dig>  mm represented the concentration at which no more than 50% of the plants exhibited a phenotype of reduced stature and/or growth rate . at a concentration of  <dig>  mm 5-azac around 70% of the population are expected to survive ; this being the concentration that reduces survival by 50% of the overall possible reduction given an estimated  lower asymptote. accordingly, we adopted two concentrations,  <dig>  mm and  <dig> mm 5-azac for generation of the braroaz population.

establishment of the braroaz dna hypomethylated population 
having identified suitable concentrations of 5-azac that would generate a population comprising plants that are likely to be fertile and yield good seed, and yet also show heritable phenotypic effects, we then applied these concentrations to establish a hypomethylated e <dig> population of b. rapa line r-o- <dig> . two sub-populations, each containing  <dig> plants, were established  from seed treatments of  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm 5-azac respectively .

seed for a total of  <dig>  e <dig> sib-lines were harvested. phenotypic comparison of the e <dig> plants with the control  plants  allowed selection of  <dig>  e <dig> sib-lines   for assessment of the e <dig> generation. these corresponded to  <dig> original e <dig> plants per treatment, where atypical variation  had been observed in survival rate, flowering time, plant height, secondary branching and floral morphology.

e <dig> selfed seed were harvested from  <dig> e <dig> lines, together with  <dig> control  lines. for each e <dig> plant, seed from three separate siliques from the middle of the primary inflorescence were harvested and stored independently. in addition, seed from the remaining siliques for each plant were pooled. one seed was used per seed source to generate the e <dig> generation. thus, there were four unique e <dig> seed accessions  per e <dig> plant .

in general there was a lower level of morphological phenotypic variation in the e <dig> plants compared with the e <dig> plants but still higher than the controls. however, we did observe a low frequency of sectoring, reduced plant stature, smaller leaves, defective anthers, embryo abortion, reduced seed set and seed size.

we next harvested selfed seed from  <dig> arbitrarily selected e <dig> sib-lines  corresponding to  <dig> original e <dig> plants, to generate an e <dig> population. seed from one selected silique were harvested and stored independently, with the remaining seed pooled. these plants retained a higher variability than was seen in the controls, albeit less than the e <dig> 

variability in patterns of dna methylation
msap analysis was used to assess the extent to which treatment had perturbed global methylation profiles. the analysis was based on a sample of  <dig> seeds from five lines each of s <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> and two s <dig> lines. the capacity of 5-azac to inhibit methyltransferase activity led to the expectation that profiles generated by the methylation-sensitive hpaii and mspi would diverge in untreated samples  but converge in treated samples . as expected, there was marked divergence revealed by principal coordinate analysis  between the hpaii and mspi profiles in all untreated samples . however, there was considerable variance between the behaviour of the treated lines. four treated lines  from the e <dig> and e <dig> generations showed a marked loss in discrimination between enzyme profiles relative to the untreated controls . conversely, the remaining treated lines retained the wide divergence between the hpaii and mspi profiles, and so were indistinguishable from the untreated control lines . the significance of these differences was estimated using phipt by amova. here, the same four lines were alone in generating sufficiently low phipt values to infer non-significant divergence between the hpaii and mspi profiles . all remaining lines produced the hpaii and mspi profiles that were highly significantly divergent  .

we assessed the spatial distribution of 5mc in chromosomes by immuno-labelling in meiotic pachytene spreads of control s <dig> lines, and in four braroaz_e <dig> lines. clusters of 5mc signal co-localised with heterochromatic regions both in control plants and in braroaz_e <dig> plants but were notably reduced within the euchromatin of the braroaz_e <dig> lines .

hypomethylation affects seed size and other yield components
we next examined whether agronomically important aspects of seed morphology and composition had been altered by the treatment. seed size was inferred indirectly from the area of seed in profile. seeds from braroaz e <dig> lines were on average  <dig> mm <dig>  smaller than the s <dig> controls . components of variation between lines were greater for the braroaz e <dig> lines  than for the control r-o- <dig> s <dig> sib-lines . similarly, variation between seeds within lines was greater for the braroaz e <dig> lines  than for the control r-o- <dig> s <dig> sib-lines , and a subset of braroaz e <dig> lines exhibited a much greater range of seed size. braroaz e <dig> lines also had a greater range of seed size compared with the s <dig> controls . we found no evidence of correlation between seed size and seed number per silique in individual sib-lines and control lines.

seed yield within the braroaz_e <dig> and braroaz_e <dig> populations was considerably more variable than in the corresponding s <dig> and s <dig> lines . we analysed a subset of  <dig> e <dig> lines and found that seven of the top  <dig> yielding lines were scored with profuse branching  compared with nine of the remaining  <dig> lines. seed yield per plant showed a strong correlation  with the number of seeds per plant, which may be a direct consequence of the increased branching and/or increased fertility. however, the observed variation in seed size was poorly correlated with seed yield , as well as with number of seed per plant . this suggests that the effects of treatment on seed size are probably independent from those on other yield components.

seed composition
the braroaz e <dig> sib-lines yielded seed with a lower total oil content  and higher total protein content  than the s <dig> controls. for both components there was a similar range of variation within the braroaz_e <dig> population.

there was increased variation in proportion of individual fatty acids in the braroaz e <dig> population compared with the controls . within the braroaz e <dig> population we observed a similar, but more extenuated variability, although here, increased spread was also observed in the s <dig> control lines, perhaps indicating greater gxe interactions . in general, there was an increase in palmitic  and linoleic  acids, corresponding to a decrease in erucic acid  in most treated lines. examination of the pairwise relationships between line means for individual fatty acids enabled us to infer that hypomethylation may have targeted specific steps in fatty acid elongation and/or side-chain modification  <cit> . for example, the negative correlation  of erucic acid : linoleic acid is consistent  <cit>  with up-regulation of fad <dig>  furthermore, there was a positive correlation  between palmitic acid and linoleic acid, and a negative correlation  between palmitic acid and erucic acid.

stochastic hypomethylation and associated transcriptional changes in b. rapa
finally, we sought evidence for specific transcriptional changes associated with 5-azac-induced hypomethylation in a representative treated b. rapa line. in these experiments, leaf rna from two wild-type control lines and a single e <dig> line  was hybridised against the affymetrix genechip® brassica exon  <dig>  st array, which is based on the 135k unigene set  <cit> . at a threshold of  <dig> - fold change in transcription level, 10% of genes appeared to show a change in transcript level. at a higher threshold of 2-fold change,  <dig> % of genes showed a change in transcript level, with  <dig> genes up-regulated in the braroaz_12445e <dig> plant compared with the r-o- <dig> wild-type control . preliminary analysis of go terms indicated that  <dig> genes classified as involved in the cellular component were upregulated in the braroaz plant. overall, a small number of genes were significantly up-regulated in this braroaz plant , while none appeared to be significantly down-regulated.

discussion
we have performed a systematic dose–response characterisation of the effect of dna hypomethylation induced by 5-azac in b. rapa. based on this analysis, we generated a unique hypomethylated population of  <dig>  e <dig> sib-lines with a stochastic distribution of reduced 5mcg marks. each line represents a unique combination of hypomethylated epialleles that are available for forward and reverse genetic screening. we carried out forward screening and investigated the range of variation for seed size and other yield components, as well as seed composition. these epi-tilling populations are analogous to those generated using conventional nucleotide mutagens such as ems  <cit> . however, they do offer the distinct opportunity to explore and exploit subtle interactions with phenotype that may be associated with epiallelic variation.

before adopting any treatment that seeks to reveal new epigenetic variation through interference in endogenous methylation control systems, it is important first to demonstrate efficacy of treatment and to optimise its application. 5-azac is a structural analogue of the nucleoside cytidine  <cit>  that inhibits the action of the dna methyltransferase met <dig>  which in plants maintains methylation in exonic 5mcg contexts. however, there is scope for ineffective application should the 5-azac fail to access the target tissues, or should the time of exposure be insufficient to elicit a response. conversely, excessive application could lead to toxicity and/or lethal levels of mutation or demethylation  <cit> . it is therefore important to develop appropriate strategies to evaluate whether exposure levels were sufficient to ensure efficacy of demethylation whilst also minimising potentially damaging effects. we used frequency of survivorship and the absence of gross phenotypic abnormality to establish that the level of 5-azac applied was not excessive. the dose–response to 5-azac was sigmoidal for several traits recorded, similar to that observed for chemical mutagens such as ems. this suggests that the b. rapa genome is able to tolerate low concentrations up to ~ <dig> mm 5-azac for the treatment period of three days during which mitoses are occurring in the meristematic cells. above this concentration, an exponential response is observed up to ~ <dig> mm 5-azac, above which there were no apparent additional lethal effects. moreover, there were only minor cytotoxic effects observed within hypocotyls and cotyledon tissues in seedlings. in general, the e <dig> plants completed their life cycle at all concentrations, and successfully set seed.

the potency of the 5-azac dose–response is likely to vary, depending on the dinucleotide composition and structural organisation of different genomes  <cit> . compared with ems in the same r-o- <dig> genotype  <cit> , 5-azac gave rise to a greater proportion of plants with a normal visual phenotype, although the effects on fertility were similar.

it is important next to verify that the 5-azac treatment apparently leading to these effects is doing so by causing hypomethylation of the genome. we examined this in two ways. first, immune-localisation of methylated cytosines revealed essentially similar distributions of fish signal across the euchromatic regions of pachytene chromosomes in treated  and control plants but with a marked reduction of signal in treated lines. this is consistent with the expected genome-wide hypomethylation associated with 5-azac treatment and congruent with previous observations in triticale  <cit> . second, we compared the level of disparity between the msap product profiles generated by the isoschizomers hpaii  and mspi. as expected, untreated control lines exhibited wide divergence between the profiles generated by the two enzymes, largely because of their differential sensitivity to the presence of cytosine methylation. however, it was notable that this distinction had been lost in four of the treated lines sampled, but had been retained in others. the most plausible explanation of this finding is that hypomethylation triggered by the 5-azac treatment had been stochastically effective and was only apparent in a subset of treated plants. this finding is consistent with the similar frequency of phenotypic abnormality seen in the e <dig> and e <dig> plants. given the stochastic nature of 5-azac efficacy, this relatively simple approach has direct and valuable utility in allowing early identification of e <dig> lines where the treatment has actually affected the intended hypomethylation. this capacity would greatly improve the efficiency of any high-throughput programme seeking to use the chemical to generate new levels of phenotypic variation, or otherwise to manipulate the methylation status for genetic or epigenetic studies of gene function.

having generated variation in methylation status, it is important next to determine the extent of associated phenotypic variation among the treated plants. in the present study, we certainly found additional phenotypic variation at the e <dig> generation when compared to untreated controls, as reported previously in a range of plant species  <cit> . however, compared with b. oleracea <cit> , 5-azac appeared to give rise to a reduced range of morphological phenotypic effects in b. rapa r-o- <dig>  this may be partly attributed to the smaller genome size of the brassica a genome  <cit>  and/or different chromatin organisation, particularly in terms of relative amounts of heterochromatin and/or distribution of transposable elements  <cit> . using a cytological approach, braszewska-zalewska  <cit>  showed that the b. rapa genome has a distinct distribution of dna methylation, primarily located in the heterochromatin when compared with b. oleracea.

there was also evidence that novel variation was present in several traits of agronomic importance. for example, flowering time is a complex multigenic trait that is regulated through the interaction of different signal transduction pathways  <cit> . our finding that flowering time in the e <dig> generation is delayed following exposure to ≥  <dig> mm 5-azac is consistent with methylation playing some role in the control of flowering time in b. rapa. the clone of b. rapa used  is unresponsive to vernalisation, in common with the arabidopsis ecotype landsberg erecta <cit> . this phenotype in arabidopsis has been attributed to reactivation of fwa, a repressor of flowering which is constitutively methylated in its promoter and therefore repressed in the wild type at most stages of the life cycle. fwa is maternally imprinted  <cit>  and is dependent on dna methylation for its imprinted state  <cit> . however, we also observed a reduction in the time to flowering in a subset of e <dig> plants exposed to  <dig>  mm 5-azac, a finding that is congruent with several previous reports  <cit>  subsequent systematic screening of flowering time within the braroaz e <dig> population treated with  <dig>  mm 5-azac also indicated a reduced time to flowering. curiously, in some cases early flowering phenotypes were observed in the e <dig> generation from e <dig> lines had been late flowering, a phenomenon that has also been found in e <dig> and e <dig> populations of b. oleracea var. italica . this may be due to segregation of alleles in the e <dig> generation that affect different components of the flowering pathway and is perhaps indicative of the high level of redundancy and interdependency in the epigenetic control of this important trait.

the increased variability generated by stochastic hypomethylation of the genome has most value if this variation can be fixed or at least stabilized. previous studies have demonstrated that this can be achieved in arabidopsis through self-pollination  <cit>  or doubled haploid production . the dose–response analysis informed our selection of optimal concentration of 5-azac to use for generation of the braroaz population, where e <dig> seed was set from  <dig> % of e <dig> plants. the establishment of this population is analogous to an ems-tilling population and is available to be used for both forward and reverse epi-genetic screening. as expected, we observed a reduced range of phenotypes compared with ems mutagenesis in the same r-o- <dig> genotype  <cit> . 5-azac only targets a subset of methylated sites where these exist, whereas ems induces transition mutations which can lead to truncation of transcripts and modification of proteins, and is able to target all regions of the genome.

in plants, dna methylation is at least sometimes transmitted directly through meiosis and maintained through post-meiotic mitosis giving rise to gametophytes  <cit> . in two separate experiments  we found that certain phenotypes were transgenerationally inherited from e <dig> to e <dig> generation following 5-azac treatment. these included an overall reduction in plant stature, small seed size and modified floral morphology. the apparent loss of variation observed in e <dig> and e <dig> generations relative to e <dig> could arise for a number of reasons, including re-methylation of specific cell-lineages forming gametes, dominance of wild-type alleles and segregation of epistatic loci. the e <dig> and subsequent generations are expected to possess functional met <dig> loci, and hence progressive re-methylation of specific cg sites may occur. the ability to distinguish between novel epi-alleles and collateral genetic variation, such as may result from activation of transposons, requires more detailed segregation and molecular analyses.

the range of morphological variation we observed was comparable to that observed following down-regulation of genes involved in maintenance dna methylation  <cit> . a key attribute of the hypomethylated population we have generated is that there has only been a transitory exposure to 5-azac, that inhibits met <dig> activity for the small number of cell divisions that occurred over three days during seed imbibition and meristem activation. in contrast, constitutive down regulation of met <dig>  affects a range of phenotypes including plant stature, leaves, apical dominance, flowering and fertility  <cit> . from preliminary analysis of ems mutation of braa.met <dig> a we have evidence of effects on plant stature, leaf shape and fertility . a similar range of abnormal phenotypes is observed in arabidopsis ddm <dig> mutants  <cit> . although developmental abnormalities were not initially reported in b. rapa following rnai down-regulation of braa.ddm <dig> <cit> , we have observed some morphological abnormalities in subsequent generations.

the structure of the braroaz population provides a means for systematic screening of epiallelic variation. the distribution of 5mcg marks retained in the e <dig> and subsequent generations is expected to be stochastic, leading to local variations in epiallelic status of adjacent genes. this offers several advantages over constitutive down-regulation of met <dig>  for example, in met <dig> mutants of arabidopsis up to 90% reduction in cytosine methylation can occur, predominantly in cpg dinucleotides  <cit> . availability of epirils in arabidopsis generated from a cross between wild type and the ddm <dig> mutant offers an alternative strategy for characterising epigenetic effects at target loci  <cit> . however, this approach may not be so effective in more complex genomes such as brassica, which contain multiple paralogous genic regions, and a larger load of transposable elements.

we observed variation in a range of seed yield and composition traits, within both the e <dig> and e <dig> generations. epigenetic processes have been implicated in the regulation of seed size, with dna methylation appearing to play a key role. for example, crosses between a hypomethylated maternal genome and wild type paternal genome lead to increased seed size, whereas the reciprocal crosses lead to reduced seed size  <cit> . for some lines we observed inheritance of the reduced seed size phenotype from e <dig> to e <dig> generations. we were able to demonstrate that the variation in seed size is largely independent of seed number and seed yield per plant, suggesting that there is opportunity to select and recombine specific epialleles to increase overall yield.

we found that hypomethylation had an effect across the population  of increasing seed protein content, with a corresponding decrease in oil content. given our null hypothesis was random variation around the wild-type mean for both components, this indicates that hypomethylation could lead to de-repression of specific genes that modulate the oil:protein ratio, either via specific resource allocation pathways, or through interaction with the normal seed development and maturation programme.

in addition, we have demonstrated that hypomethylation can give rise to large modulations in the proportion of key seed fatty acid components, and that these are transmitted through at least one meiotic event. these effects include decreases in erucic acid that correspond to increases in linoleic and/or palmitic acid. this level of variation is consistent with that observed in surveys of natural genetic variation and population segregation within brassica species  <cit> . the inference of which steps in the accepted fatty acid synthesis pathways are affected allows us to postulate which sets of genes may have been up-regulated as a result of hypomethylation. this either may be due to direct effects on a specific enzyme or as a result of de-repression of an activator of a specific enzyme. for example, the reduction in the levels of erucic acid and corresponding increase in levels of linoleic acid is consistent with activation of fad <dig> <cit> . the increases in palmitic acid with concomitant increase in linoleic may indicate an activation of a gene earlier in the fatty acid elongation pathways.

there was no consistent pattern of inheritance at a population level between the e <dig> and e <dig> for seed composition traits. however, this is as expected for relatively complex traits in bulked sib-seed, where there may be strong g×e interactions compounded with segregation of one or more affected loci. moreover, greater variation was observed in the s <dig> controls compared with s <dig>  underlying the importance of studying epiallelic variation in well controlled and reproducible environments. variation in 5mcg marks have been implicated in modulating g×e interactions in the vernalisation response of flc and maf- <dig> <cit> . dna methylation marks also tend to exclude histone h2a.z  <cit> , which appears to play an essential role in temperature perception  <cit> . as with ems tilling populations the stochastic distribution of mutant alleles in early generations is likely to mask the phenotypic effect of single loci. thus it is necessary to generate backcross lines  through at least three generations prior to carrying out a rigorous segregation analysis and identifying the relevant loci.

preliminary transcript analysis of leaf tissue from individual e <dig> plants did not show any evidence of widespread variation in gene expression, with only a small number of genes being up-regulated and none down-regulated. this is consistent with the observed phenotypic observations and de-repression of transcription expected, given the stochastic distribution of modified  <dig> mc sites that will have arisen from the original 5-azac treatment. under controlled growth conditions on two distinct occasions, more variation was observed in transcript profile between homozygous wild type controls than was observed between two sib e <dig> plants grown on single occasions. more comprehensive screening of lines is required to understand the distribution and pattern of epiallelic variation affecting transcript levels within the population, and this may be amenable to targeted reverse epiallelic assays.

CONCLUSIONS
generating stochastically hypomethylated populations may assist epiallele discovery across a wide range of crop plants, and has considerable potential as an intervention strategy for crop improvement  <cit> . this will require development of strategies that ensure stable retention and deployment of desirable epialleles within breeding material or seed multiplication stocks, and also to develop new techniques for targeted epigenetic modification. these strategies need to take into account issues of re-methylation, g×e interactions, as well as epigenomic remodelling resulting from initial hybridisation events  <cit> . we have previously suggested  <cit>  the need for rapid isolation of chromosomal segments carrying a modified epiallele through introgression. targeted reverse epi-genetic screening also requires detailed knowledge of the distribution of 5mc in crop genomes using high throughput bisulphite sequencing  <cit> , together with locus-specific marker assays that detect epialleles using technologies, such as high resolution melts  <cit> .
