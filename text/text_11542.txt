BACKGROUND
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  is a fatal neuromuscular disorder affecting 1– <dig> in  <dig>  persons. it is caused by the degeneration of motoneurons in brain and spinal cord, leading to muscle atrophy, progressive paralysis, and death, commonly by respiratory failure. most cases of als are sporadic  and about 10% familial , with mutant forms of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase  causing 20% of fals cases. findings in als patients and model systems have implicated numerous genes in als pathogenesis, and have identified diverse processes, such as oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein aggregation, cytoskeletal abnormalities, impaired axonal transport, inflammation, and apoptosis, as contributing factors  <cit> . as a mainly sporadic disease affecting multiple cellular processes, als therefore suggests itself for comprehensive expression profiling and gene- and pathway-based analyses. the few existing genomics studies of als  <cit> , however, have had limited genome coverage and have been restricted to gene-based analyses.

adding a further layer of complexity, als is a highly heterogenous disease, with clinical indicators helping to define als subtypes. one such indicator is a differential depletion of motoneurons in motor cortex and spinal cord  <cit> , giving significance to the characterization of both tissues. the motor cortex contains upper motoneurons , which extend axons traversing the corticospinal tract to signal to the spinal cord, where lower motoneurons  relay their signal. the corticospinal tract volume is reduced  <cit>  and umns are depleted  <cit>  in als patients, and umns are required for lmn function and muscle control  <cit> . most importantly, patients with sporadic, non-sod1-associated forms of als show alterations in the motor cortex, such as increased excitability and reduced inhibitory activity, which are not readily detectable in sod1-linked fals patients, thus stressing the particular importance of investigating the motor cortex in sals subjects  <cit> . possibly owing to earlier clinical manifestations of defects in lmns and their easier accessibility to experimenters, however, most investigations of als, including previous genomics studies  <cit> , focus on the spinal cord and lmns, leaving als-related responses and defects of cellular maintenance in the motor cortex under-investigated.

here we address the importance of umn abnormalities in sals pathology and exploit the power of pathway-based significance tests by whole-genome expression profiling of the motor cortex of sals patients. we identify differentially expressed genes and pathways, interpret the role of candidate genes in als pathology using these pathways as a functional outline, and evaluate the implications of our findings for als research and the development of als therapies.

RESULTS
expression profiling of the motor cortex of sals patients
we investigated the motor cortex of eleven sals and nine control subjects  with whole-genome oligonucleotide microarrays and following microscopic assessment of tissue architecture . out of over  <dig>  genes and expressed sequence tags tested,  <dig>  genes passed our quality control criteria , constituting our complete data set for subsequent analyses. median and average fold-changes of our complete data set were  <dig>  , establishing that no systematic bias for up- or down-regulation was introduced into subsequent statistical analyses.

 <dig> motor-cortex samples of eleven als patients and nine controls were analyzed on individual whole human genome arrays for genome-wide expression profiling. age, gender, race, and post-mortem interval  are shown for all tissue samples. a – miami brain and tissue bank for developmental disorders; b – ambion, inc.; n/a – not available

to exploit the comprehensiveness of our data, we combined two complementary, stringent approaches, investigating changes in the sals motor cortex for functional gene groups and on the level of individual genes.

pathway-based analysis
we first performed a pathway-based analysis of the complete data set by testing changes of gene expression in the context of  <dig> gene groups of the gene ontology  hierarchy, using the genmapp  <dig>  software. analyses on the level of functional gene groups lead to a biologically transparent picture of expression, accessible to interpretation. what is more, by combining measurements for functionally related genes this approach increases the sensitivity of detecting significant changes when differential gene expression is diluted in a mixed cell population  and with small to moderate sample numbers . in such instances individual genes will not pass statistical criteria for differential gene expression, while moderate deregulation of multiple genes constituting a functional group might test highly significant. indeed, the statistical significances we derived from genmapp  <dig> , using the average fold-change per gene as a basis for statistical tests, is independent of the number of samples and highly dependent on the number of genes represented by our data, while the quality filtering and the comparably large number of samples used in this study avoid the detection of spurious results and promote a correspondence between statistical and biological significance. in other words,  <dig> go categories were probed with  <dig>  quality filtered genes, and  <dig> samples were used to derive representative average fold-changes to do so. genmapp detected  <dig> go categories as unchanged, while  <dig> partially redundant categories exhibited significantly changed expression in als subjects . significant go categories fell into six major processes of relevance in the context of a comprehensive als disease model, five of them down-regulated and one up-regulated .

shown are all go nodes differentially regulated between sals motor-cortex-patient samples and controls for the comprehensive dataset. of  <dig>  probes in the dataset,  <dig>  were linked to a go term. nodes are sorted by up- or down-regulation , then sorted by corrected p value  and z value . cc – cellular component; mf – molecular function; bp – biological process

identification of candidate genes
we then analyzed the complete data set for individual genes showing differential gene expression, finding that  <dig> of the  <dig>  quality-filtered genes  fulfilled our stringent criteria , with  <dig> genes showing down-regulation and  <dig> up-regulation in sals subjects . in contrast to results for large gene groups, differential expression of individual mrnas is readily verifiable by alternative techniques, such as quantitative rt-pcr  and in-situ hybridization.

confirmation by quantitative rt-pcr
the 60-mer oligonucleotide format of microarrays used in this study may provide tolerance for sequence mismatches. to investigate probe-target specificity, the sequences of oligonucleotide probes corresponding to differentially expressed genes were compared to genbank sequences by blastn queries. the only probes showing up to ten mismatches with more than one gene were seven metallothioneins . to discriminate among these homologous genes and analyze their differential expression we used qrt-pcr. pvalb, down-regulated in the als motor cortex, was also included in our qrt-pcr analysis as a positive control for the correspondence of microarray and qrt-pcr data. in contrast to the metallothionein probes the pvalb probe, representative of probes for the remaining candidates, detects transcripts for a single gene, only. pvalb and six of the metallothioneins were specifically quantifiable by qrt-pcr . microarray and qrt-pcr results were concordant , confirming up-regulation of six metallothioneins and down-regulation of pvalb in the sals motor cortex. mt1b, whose microarray probe shares 87% sequence identity with mt1l, could not be detected specifically by three independent primer pairs, and was excluded from subsequent analyses.

confirmation by in-situ hybrization
to verify the microarray results in a direct fashion , we then performed double-blind in-situ hybridization for four candidate genes in human motor cortex sections from five control and five sals subjects. median fluorescence levels of entire tissue sections for diseased and control subjects were measured for four candidate genes , showing a strong correlation with the microarray data .

confirmation at the protein level
we then proceeded to validate our findings for mrnas at the level of proteins, which for the overwhelming majority of rnas investigated in this study represent the biologically active equivalent. while individual genes may show discrepancies between mrna and protein levels, owing to translational and post-translational control, an on average fair correlation between protein and mrna levels can be expected in mammalian systems  <cit> . protein extracts of three healthy and six diseased samples, equalized for total protein content, were analyzed by immunoblotting . quantification of protein levels revealed an up-regulation for anxa <dig>  and aqp <dig> , and a down-regulation of nrgn  in diseased samples. these findings were in line with and exceeded the fold-changes of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively, detected by microarray-based analysis for the corresponding mrnas. remarkably, aqp <dig> is generally assumed to be absent from the motor cortex, with a predominant expression in the brain in the choroid plexus  <cit>  and in glial cells in the peripheral nervous system  <cit> . we therefore also performed immunofluorescence analyses of motor-cortical sections to elaborate our findings , demonstrating the presence of aqp <dig> in non-neuronal cells in the motor cortex.

comparison with sals spinal-cord and ad hippocampus expression data
we then compared expression ratios diseased vs. control for the sals motor cortex to previously published data for spinal cord grey matter  <cit> . a comparison of all  <dig> genes reliably detected in both tissues showed a negligible correlation , while  <dig> of the motor-cortex candidate genes also present in the reduced data set showed a high correlation  between both tissues .

expression ratios for candidate genes identified in the present report  are compared to those found by dangond et al.  <cit>  , giving a correlation coefficient of r =  <dig> . spinal cord data were retrieved from the gene expression omnibus database  and processed as described in the methods section.

== both tissues give the same result, differing ≤ <dig> -fold

= both tissues give the same result, differing > <dig> -fold

<> both tissues give different results 

to assess in how far responses detected in the motor cortex of sals patients might be shared with other neurodegenerative diseases, we then compared our data to expression ratios diseased vs. healthy for previously published data by blalock et al.  <cit>  for the hippocampus of patients with severe alzheimer's disease . a comparison of all  <dig> genes reliably detected in both tissues showed a low correlation , while  <dig> of the motor-cortex candidate genes also present in the reduced data set showed a moderate correlation  between both tissues .

expression ratios for candidate genes identified in the present report  are compared to those found for data by blalock et al.  <cit>  for alzheimer's disease , giving a correlation coefficient of r =  <dig> . ad data were retrieved from geo  and processed as described in the methods section.

== both tissues give the same result, differing ≤ <dig> -fold

= both tissues give the same result, differing > <dig> -fold

<> both tissues give different results 

despite the distinctive clinical manifestations of ad and its action on different areas of the central nervous system, therefore, global responses in the ad hippocampus correspond more closely to those in the sals motor cortex than do those in the sals spinal cord. this observation might reflect similar general changes in both brain tissues under long-term stress and after prolonged disease pathology, and ties in with the implication of processes such as oxidative stress, reduced energy metabolism, intracellular protein aggregation, and inflammation in both, ad and als pathogenesis. importantly and similar to our findings for the sals motor cortex, blalock et al.  <cit>  detected atp biosynthesis and glycolysis by pathway-based analysis as significantly reduced in ad, and found deregulation in line with ours for defense response and microtubule-based process, albeit below the significance threshold. changes significantly linked to the diseased state in our study, however, are highly correlated between sals motor cortex and spinal cord, and less similar between sals motor cortex and ad hippocampus. in particular, atp1a <dig>  egr <dig>  and chgb experience opposing deregulation in the sals motor cortex compared to the ad hippocampus, with anxa <dig>  atp6v1a, eif4a <dig>  nsf, and all the metallothioneins detected in the hippocampus  also showing markedly different regulation between both tissues.

discussion
a framework for the understanding of als pathogenesis
a combination of candidate genes and pathway-based analysis provided a comprehensive view, at the level of mrna, of the processes involved in als pathogenesis, suggesting an interpretation of changes in gene expression within a framework of deregulated pathways . it should be pointed out that, inherent to the analysis of end-stage diseased tissue, microarray analysis cannot distinguish between bona-fide up- and down-regulation of a gene and the selective survival and death, respectively, of cells highly expressing it. this ambiguity generally does not alter the interpretation of the role a given candidate gene with an established function might play in disease pathology. moreover, selective cell death or survival appear unlikely explanations for the identification of candidate genes with two-fold changes of expression. however, this limitation needs to be borne in mind and will not be re-itterated in the course of the discussion. nearly all candidate genes identified by this study may be actors in als pathogenesis based on their existing characterizations, and some of them stand out as potentially critical to de-regulated processes and to als therapy.

mitochondrial energy metabolism
mitochondrial energy metabolism is a process down-regulated at the mrna level and represented by all three major go categories and by genes contributing to the tricarboxylic acid  cycle  and involved in oxidative phosphorylation . the tca accepts glycolysis-derived pyruvate as a key entry component. an alternative route for the supply of the tca with pyruvate is its import downstream of the down-regulated mdh <dig>  the cytosolic malate dehydrogenase  <cit> . downstream of the tca, oxidative phosphorylation occurs, for which we detected a specific down-regulation of genes encoding ndufa <dig>  a component of complex i of the electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane, cycs, facilitating electron transport from complex iii to complex iv in the intramembrane space, and atp5a <dig>  a component of the atp synthase in the inner mitochondrial membrane. importantly, the down-regulated cycs is not only a component of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, but also represents a cytoplasmic signal for neuronal apoptosis as a result of impaired mitochondrial integrity. opening of the mitochondrial transition pore normally serves the ion exchange between matrix and cytosol, but is thought to be exaggerated upon excitotoxic levels of ca2+, leading to release of cycs from the mitochondrion  <cit> . cycs release, its activation of cellular caspases, and subsequent apoptosis have been proposed as a contributing factor to neuronal cell death in als  <cit> . a lowered expression of cycs, however, would conceivably decrease the sensitivity to stress-induced apoptosis  <cit> . more significantly, our observations expand a role for mitochondrial dysfunction in the death of als motoneurons, which is otherwise mainly understood as a consequence of mitochondrial recruitment of mutant sod <dig> in fals  <cit> , and which was even ruled out for sals by one study  <cit> . importantly, the significant down-regulation of go nodes relating to mitochondria can not be the mere consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction or reduced numbers of mitochondria, as the go hierarchy does not represent mitochondrion-encoded transcripts. moreover, nuclear-encoded transcripts encoding mitochondrial proteins are universally induced during conditions of oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage  <cit> , contrary to our observations for motor-cortical cells of sals patients.

glycolysis
glycolysis was detected as significantly down-regulated in the sals motor cortex by pathway-based analysis of our microarray data. glycolysis represents the cytoplasmic alternative to mitochondrial atp generation by the tca cycle and by oxidative phosphorylation, but is also a major source of pyruvate supply to the tca cycle. at the level of individual genes, significant changes in gene expression similarly indicate a reduction of glycolysis  and glucose availability . the up-regulation of angptl <dig> reduces expression of genes involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis  <cit> . the down-regulation of granins chgb and scg <dig>  both processed by the down-regulated prohormone convertase pcsk <dig>  increases insulin levels, hence reducing the availability of glucose for glycolysis  <cit> . in the context of als-related oxidative stress and neuronal modulation of ion gradients, a reduction of glycolytic energy supply, in combination with reduced mitochondrial energy supply, would constitute a major cause for neuronal cell death.

ion homeostasis and solute transport
ion homeostasis and solute transport is detected as reduced at the mrna level by pathway-based analysis and covers both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial events . for instance,  <dig> % of monovalent inorganic cation transporter activity includes genes involved in proton transport , commonly associated with organelle membranes , and genes involved in the transport of sodium ions  and metal ions in general , more commonly associated with the plasma membrane. ion homeostasis and solute transport comprises three groups of candidate genes relating to excitotoxicity, calcium homeostasis, and water and solute transport, respectively.

excitotoxicity, the excessive signaling of glutamate receptors, is a key pathogenic mechanism proposed in als, and is aggravated by a weakening of inhibitory synaptic events mediated by the gabaa receptor. alterations of its composition, such as the depletion of its gabra <dig> subunit found in this study, was previously demonstrated in human motor cortex of als patients and is associated with heightened excitability  <cit> . increased excitability, and hence exacerbated excitotoxicity, may also derive from the reduced expression of atp1a <dig>  kcnc <dig>  and slc12a <dig>  mutations of the plasma-membrane na+/k+ pump atp1a <dig> have been linked to rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism  <cit> . moreover, atp1a <dig> expression is reduced in sod <dig> fals mice  <cit>  and in motoneurons of wobbler mice, a genetic model of spinal-cord motoneuronal degeneration, with progesterone treatment restoring both, atp1a <dig> mrna expression and viability of motoneurons  <cit> . kcnc <dig> regulates the voltage-dependent potassium ion permeability of excitable membranes, and its decreased expression may lead to decreased potassium conductance and hence delayed repolarization of axons. while kcnc <dig> itself is poorly characterized, defects in other voltage-gated potassium channels can lead to hyperexcitability and hypersensitivity to oxidative stress  <cit> . slc12a <dig> encodes the neuronal isoform of the potassium-chloride cotransporter family. during early development, increased expression of slc12a <dig> lowers the intraneuronal chloride concentration below its electrochemical equilibrium and allows gaba to act as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. conversely, a switch of gaba action from inhibitory to excitatory has been proposed as a mechanism contributing to excitotoxicity in injured neurons. indeed, down-regulation of slc12a <dig> expression together with gabaa receptor-mediated excitation occurs after in-vivo axonal injury  <cit> , and mouse slc12a <dig> knockouts suffer severe motor deficits and immediate postnatal death by asphyxiation  <cit> .

calcium homeostasis and calcium-binding proteins are critical to preventing motoneuron death in als, and with pvalb, dscr1l <dig>  nrgn, and pcp <dig> we found four genes down-regulated in the als motor cortex that moderate the impact of intracellular calcium release. there is disagreement whether the calcium buffer pvalb represents a marker of motoneurons resistant to als-related cell death  <cit> , but its reduction would likely increase cell death at the elevated calcium concentration typical of als  <cit> . similarly, dscr1l <dig> is an inhibitor of calcineurin  <cit> , a mediator of many cellular responses, including apoptosis  <cit> . depletion of the two calmodulin-binding proteins nrgn and pcp <dig>  involved in moderating calmodulin-mediated calcium signaling, would further reduce resistance to calcium-mediated toxicity  <cit> .

water and solute transport is represented by the up-regulation of aqp <dig> and slc14a <dig>  both, aqp <dig> and slc14a <dig>  experience up-regulation with age and by hypertonicity  <cit> , and like aqp <dig> the urea transporter slc14a <dig> may also function as an efficient water transporter  <cit> . their joint up-regulation found in this study is indicative of disturbed ion and water homeostasis in the motor cortex of sals patients. the water transporter aqp <dig> in particular is of interest through its association with synaptic vesicles and participation in their swelling in cells outside the central nervous system  <cit> .

protein modification and turnover
protein modification and turnover are essential to motoneuron survival, resulting in the selective death of motoneurons upon chemical inhibition of the proteasome complex  <cit> , which we detected as down-regulated in sals samples by pathway-based analysis of our microarray data, thus stressing a role of disturbed protein turnover in als pathogenesis. indeed, the progressive accumulation of polyubiquitinated protein conjugates, indicating a failure of proteasomal turnover, is a consistent feature of many neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> , including als  <cit> . in line with this we also observed the down-regulation of uchl <dig>  a neuron-specific ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase- <dig>  which also displays a secondary dimerization-dependent ubiquitin-ligase activity and represents up to 2% of total soluble brain protein  <cit> . a point mutation affecting the ligase activity of uchl <dig> has been linked to parkinson's disease  <cit> , while an internal 42-amino-acid deletion in uchl <dig> is responsible for murine gracile axonal dystrophy, which is characterized by axonal degeneration and formation of spheroid bodies in nerve terminals  <cit> . the latter phenotype and the observation of poly-ubiquitinated aggregates in als create a tantalizing link between the hydrolase activity of uchl <dig> and the depletion of uchl <dig> mrna in the motor cortex of sals patients. up-regulation of serpina <dig>  a serine protease inhibitor enriched in neurofilament conglomerates of als motoneurons  <cit> , can be seen in the same light and has been associated with other neurodegenerative diseases. in alzheimer's disease, for instance, its astrocytic expression is elevated  <cit>  and exacerbates the accumulation of protein aggregates  <cit> . serpina <dig> also has other effects, however, including protection against microglia  <cit> .

cytoskeleton
the cytoskeleton is critical for neuronal maintenance and plasticity, neurite outgrowth, axonal caliber and transport. our analysis reveals the alteration of two major components of the neuronal cytoskeleton in the als motor cortex at the mrna level, showing a general down-regulation of microtubules by pathway-based analysis and deregulation of two genes encoding tubulin beta , as well as decreased expression of all three neurofilament subunits . a depletion of microtubules and neurofilaments has deleterious effects on motoneurons, according to our present understanding of their role in als pathogenesis  <cit> . impaired microtubule-based axonal transport causes related motoneuropathies and is the earliest detectable, presymptomatic abnormality in sod1-mutant fals mice. what is more, defects in microtubule-associated motor proteins cause als-related human motoneuropathies, such as charcot-marie-tooth disease 2a  <cit>  and hereditary spastic paraplegia  <cit> , and are responsible for als phenotypes in drosophila  <cit>  and mouse  <cit> . the role of neurofilaments  in als is still controversial, despite a substantial body of research addressing the subject  <cit> . nf assemblies have been suggested as a possible impediment to axonal transport, either as its aberrantly crosslinked cargoes or in stationary aggregates, and even disturbing the stoichiometric balance between nf subunits can lead to als-like morphology and death of motoneurons. however, despite a raised incidence of mutations in nf genes in als subjects, a comprehensive study has excluded mutations in nf genes as a primary cause for als  <cit> . moreover, als pathogenesis also progresses without axonal neurofilaments  <cit> , and over-expression of nefh prolongs survival of sod1-transgenic fals mice, prompting the hypothesis that nfs primarily act as an abundant buffer for otherwise deleterious processes, such as actions of sod <dig> gain-of-function mutants  <cit>  or aberrant tyrosine nitrosylation or phosphorylation  <cit> . the down-regulation of all three nf subunits observed in this study would be detrimental according to either interpretation of nf involvement in als pathology, first by interfering with their stoichiometric balance and second by depleting their availability as a potential buffer for aberrant enzymatic activities.

neuronal maintenance and signaling
changes in neuronal maintenance and signaling, detected by gene-based analysis of our microarray data, comprise only down-regulated genes and tie in with observations for disturbed signaling in the motor cortex of sporadic, non-sod1-linked als  <cit> . depleted are general promoters of neurodifferentiation and axonal and dendritic maintenance , with clear implications for neuronal survival, but also several inhibitors of differentiation and promoters of cell proliferation , whose role in als pathogenesis is ambiguous. four additional genes  encode proteins regulating synaptic vesicle processing and exocytosis, processes highly relevant to als pathology  <cit> . while most of the above genes are known to be expressed in multiple cell types, some of them  are neuron-specific. importantly, we had ensured selecting patient material that exhibited good histological integrity of the motor cortex , thus minimizing the possibility that observations for neuron-specific genes would reflect the loss of motoneurons typical of als.

mllt <dig> expression is up-regulated in differentiated cortical neurons, and its ectopic expression in embryonic kidney cells triggers the expression of neuronal markers  <cit> . olfm <dig>  a secreted glycoprotein, is also strongly expressed in cerebral cortex  <cit>  and has been implicated in neural crest development in birds  <cit>  and neurogenesis in xenopus  <cit> . enc <dig> is a matrix protein expressed almost exclusively in the brain, whose overexpression induces neuronal process formation and whose knock-down inhibits neurite development  <cit> . similarly, the calcium-dependent action of vsnl <dig> has been linked to the promotion of axonal differentiation and to axonal plasticity  <cit> . the multifunctional protein encoded by cap <dig> links the actin cytoskeleton and camp signaling, and might therefore facilitate intracellular signal transduction events, dendritic plasticity and synaptic membrane recycling  <cit> .

amongst the down-regulated inhibitors of neurodifferentiation in the sals motor cortex are bex <dig>  a promoter of cell proliferation  <cit> , and rtn <dig> and rtn <dig>  two members of the reticulon family thought to play an important role in the regulation of neuronal regeneration. rtn <dig>  in particular, is a potent neurite outgrowth inhibitor and has been shown to inhibit the regeneration of severed axons in the mammalian central nervous system  <cit> . nptn encodes a protein involved in cell-cell interactions that inhibits neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglion and forebrain neurons  <cit> . finally, chn <dig> encodes the rac gtpase activating protein alpha-1-chimerin, which mediates the pruning of dendrites in response to synaptic activity  <cit> .

atp6v1a is a subunit of the vacuolar proton pump v-atpase, which generates a proton gradient across the membrane of maturing synaptic vesicles, required for the accumulation of neurotransmitters within them  <cit> . snap <dig> is a mediator of axonal repair, a regulator of calcium signaling, and a component of the nsf-binding snare complex, essential to vesicle fusion and recycling  <cit> , and therefore has an impact on at least three processes critical to als pathogenesis. like alsin, a likely regulator of endosome dynamics and a causative gene for juvenile forms of als  <cit> , snap <dig> is also involved in endosome recycling  <cit> , creating a fourth, albeit tentative, link of snap <dig> to als pathogenesis. syt <dig>  like snap <dig>  participates in neurite outgrowth and axonal repair, and unlike usual synaptotagmins binds to cellular membranes in a ca2+-independent fashion to facilitate membrane fusion and exocytosis  <cit> . it is unclear whether syt <dig>  like other synaptotagmins, does so by interaction with snap <dig>  following membrane fusions the down-regulated nsf, a key component of internal and exocytotic vesicle transport  <cit> , facilitates the atp-dependent recycling of snare proteins, such as snap <dig> 

defense signaling
defense signaling has been implicated in als pathogenesis by numerous studies showing inflammatory and immune responses  <cit> , and linking the detection of igg in als motoneurons to neuronal apoptosis  <cit> . additional evidence is provided by the detection of igg in motoneurons of the spinal cord and in pyramidal cells within the motor cortex of als patients  <cit>  and by the ability of igg from patients with als to induce apoptotic neuronal cell death  <cit> . importantly, igg purified from als patients was found to induce synaptic transmission through interaction with presynaptic membranes, relating autoantibodies in als to excitotoxicity  <cit> . in the present study defense signaling comprises the only up-regulated go categories in the sals motor cortex, and is represented by numerous candidate genes, whose differential expression likely promotes  or suppresses  inflammatory responses, respectively. down-regulation of pnma <dig>  whose product is a target of neurodegenerative autoimmune responses, is reminiscent of a pnma2-autoantibody-associated encephalitis patient with als symptoms, who presented with inflammation in cortex and spinal-cord grey matter  <cit> . with a suspected contribution of inflammatory responses to als pathogenesis, this suggests the targeting of pnma <dig> by neurodegenerative autoimmune responses, leading to a depletion of pnma2-positive cells. in line with this, the up-regulated fcgbp, encoding an igg-fc binding protein, may be involved in immune protection and inflammation  <cit> , and shows elevated serum levels in patients with autoimmune disorders  <cit> . elevated levels of fcgbp could therefore contribute to als pathogenesis by facilitating autoimmune and neuroinflammatory responses. up-regulation of cebpd, encoding a transcription factor of cytokines and other pro-inflammatory response genes, elevated in the brain of alzheimer's disease patients and itself induced by inflammatory stimuli, ties in with this assumption  <cit> . similarly, the down-regulation of ywhah, a gene linked to schizophrenia that encodes a transcriptional activator of the glucocorticoid receptor  <cit>  and therefore of anti-inflammatory responses, can also be predicted to aggravate neuroinflammation. the up-regulated candidate genes anxa <dig> and s100a <dig> encode two ca2+-modulated proteins expressed in microglia and are implicated in the intracellular and extracellular regulation of inflammatory responses  <cit> . anxa <dig> promotes generation of plasmin on the cell surface  <cit> , a process linked to excitotoxin-induced neurodegeneration  <cit> . s100a <dig> mediates inflammatory responses, such as the induction of chemokines, and has been linked to the reduction of cell junction proteins and of membrane integrity  <cit> .

the multifunctionality of edn <dig> and egr <dig> make the consequences of their differential expression in the sals motor cortex ambiguous. for instance, the up-regulated edn <dig>  encoding a pro-inflammatory vasoconstrictor peptide, exerts a variety of als-aggravating effects, including axonal degeneration  <cit> , impairment of water homeostasis, heightened sensitivity to hypoxic stress  <cit> , and increased excitotoxicity  <cit> . however, neuron-specific edn1-knockout mice show elevated sensitivity to pain  <cit> , and edn <dig> expression in astrocytes is required for their survival under oxidative stress  <cit> . moreover, the hypoxia-inducible edn <dig> promotes angiogenesis, reducing the possible effects of hypoxia-related oxidative stress  <cit> , amongst other mechanisms by activation of the vascular endothelial growth factor. on the other hand, down-regulation of egr <dig>  a master switch of inflammatory responses prompted by oxidative stress  <cit> , counteracts angiogenesis, thus increasing hypoxic conditions, but has an anti-inflammatory effect. it is important to note that the up-regulated angptl <dig>  and the down-regulated egr <dig>  two inducers of angiogenesis  <cit> , represent a positive and a negative target of the hypoxia-induced peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma  <cit> , respectively. therefore the differential expression of egr <dig>  angptl <dig>  and edn <dig> indicates hypoxic conditions in the sals motor cortex, tying in with a predisposition for als by mutation of angiogenin in man  <cit>  and of vascular endothelial growth factor in mouse  <cit> .

indicating protective responses in the sals motor cortex, we observed the up-regulation at the mrna level of metallothioneins , neuroprotective, anti-oxidant stress-response proteins induced by metal ions, cytokines, and other stress stimuli  <cit> . metallothioneins of the mt <dig> and mt <dig> families are expressed in astrocytes, and are increased in spinal cord of als patients and in transgenic mutant-sod <dig> mice, where their experimental reduction significantly reduces survival. importantly, endogenous mt <dig> and mt <dig> are undetectable in pure motoneuron cultures, which can be protected against oxidative stress by experimental mt <dig> overexpression  <cit> , indicating the importance of metallothionein-mediated protection normally provided by astrocytes.

orphan genes
orphan genes, candidate genes with wide-ranging functions  or without sufficient functional characterization , can only be associated tentatively with major deregulated pathways identified in this study, and were omitted from figure  <dig>  the down-regulated translation initiation factor eif4a <dig> is interchangeable with eif4a <dig> for the initiation of translation in general, and induces neural folding during embryonic development  <cit> . interestingly, eif4a <dig> has also been linked to type- <dig> diabetes and in rat cells appears to suppress insulin expression  <cit> . its down-regulation, like that of chgb, scg <dig>  and pcsk <dig>  would therefore lead to elevated insulin levels and hence reduced glucose availability . the down-regulated nap1l <dig> is an imprinted and largely uncharacterized gene, highly expressed in brain  <cit> . nap1l <dig> has sequence similarity to nap <dig>  a cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttle protein for histones, that has large-scale effects on gene expression by chromatin restructuring  <cit> . the gnas gene is also down-regulated and, like nap1l <dig>  is imprinted  <cit> . alternative first exons for gnas transcripts lead to distinct products, which in human have been linked to osteodystrophy and pseudohypoparathyroidism phenotypes, while in mouse gnas heterozygous mutants show metabolic abnormalities and insulin hypersensitivity .

CONCLUSIONS
global reduction of energy supply
pathway-based and gene-based analyses show a general down-regulation of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial components in the motor cortex of als patients. although at first glance tying in with als-related mitochondrial dysfunction, this observation is at odds with the heightened level of oxidative stress typical of als. numerous studies have characterized oxidative stress as a general inducer of nuclear genes that boost replication, maintenance and repair of mitochondria, as compensatory action for stress-related mitochondrial damage and death . the down-regulation observed in the present study suggests alternative signaling to achieve a targeted depletion of mitochondrial components in the sals motor cortex, which might therefore be a cause rather than a consequence of als pathology.

as for mitochondrial energy supply, pathway-based and gene-based analyses have independently indicated a reduction in glycolytic activity. experimental inhibition of glycolysis in an fals cell-culture model diminishes cell viability, suggesting that als-related mitochondrial dysfunction critically reduces cellular atp supply  <cit> , while hypoglycemia is a strong inducer of oxidative stress, even in the absence of such aggravating factors  <cit> . now our results indicate that reduction in glycolytic energy supply is in itself a factor contributing to als pathology, suggesting as one overriding cause of als-related neuronal cell death the depletion of intracellular atp levels by a combined reduction of the tca cycle, oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis.

reduced intracellular atp levels lead to increased susceptibility to cell death upon oxidative  <cit>  and excitotoxic  <cit>  stress, and would be particularly detrimental to the survival of neurons, as the re-establishment of ca2+ gradients and of general ion homeostasis following neuronal signaling is highly atp-dependent. as an aggravating factor, coordinated ca2+ signaling is facilitated in neurons by strategic positioning of mitochondria near endoplasmic-reticulum ca2+-release sites  <cit> . therefore, reduced availability of atp would lead to a downward spiral of an inability to remove intracellular ca2+, ca2+-induced mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species, and additional depletion of mitochondrial atp supply.

the importance of addressing all cell types in als therapy
during our expression analysis of the motor cortex we identified several candidate genes, such as aqp <dig>  cebpd, serpina <dig>  and the mt <dig> and mt <dig> family members, which are exclusively expressed in non-neuronal cells. particularly in the analysis of excitotoxicity and defense signaling, involving astrocytes and microglia, and in the interplay of inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory and of cell-death versus cell-rescue responses, the importance of different cell types involved in als pathology becomes apparent. the survival of motoneurons is highly dependent on their cellular environment, which is to a large majority made up of non-neuronal cells  <cit> . data on the interaction of neurons with glial cells in the context of als are still patchy, but there is a growing understanding that non-neuronal cells have a fundamental role to play in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> . our data indicate a general increase of microglial activity and immune responses, likely aggravating als disease symptoms. it is known, however, that the role of microglia in neuropathies extends beyond immune responses alone. only recently, activated microglia have been recognized to hypersensitize sensory neurons, and their role in motoneuronal excitotoxicity still remains to be investigated  <cit> . moreover, our data show mixed signals from astrocytes, comprising inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses, which have to be evaluated on an individual basis and might be modulated to slow disease progression. astrocytes might have significant impact on the excitotoxicity and the oxidative stress responses detected by our study, as they are in close interaction with motoneurons and neuronal synapses, and themselves express all the components required for ca2+-responsive vesicular glutamate release  <cit> .

perspectives for als therapy
in the absence of effective treatments for als, the search for potential therapeutics continues. like riluzole, the only approved als treatment to date, the vast majority of drugs currently considered for clinical trials are based on animal models with sod1-mutant background . only an estimated 2% of als cases, however, are linked to sod <dig>  and resulting treatments might therefore, similar to riluzole, have limited value as general als therapies. however, several candidate compounds for als therapy  <cit>  address aspects of sod <dig> mutants, such as oxidative stress, impaired metal binding, and defects in protein folding, that we have also identified as affected in the motor cortex of sporadic, non-sod1-linked patients.

a successful general therapy of als will have to consider the interplay and individual roles of different pathways and cell types in pathogenesis. the comprehensive analysis described here provides a full molecular portrait of the changes occurring in the motor cortex of sals patients and provides new leads for the development of effective als therapies. indeed, for the manipulation of many of the genes and pathways implicated by this study, experimental or therapeutic drugs, not yet discussed in the context of als, are already available  <cit> . moreover, our findings suggest that several drugs, currently used to treat unrelated diseases, might be of benefit to als patients. these include bosentan, an edn1-receptor antagonist employed against diabetes and pulmonary hypertension  <cit> . the widely used anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen is an antagonist of isoleucin-1β and of its downstream target serpina <dig>  <cit> . gaba antagonists such as zopiclone, used to treat insomnia, are of potential benefit to gabra1-related excitotoxicity  <cit> . significantly, symptom progression was stopped in a patient presenting with anti-pnma2-related motoneuron degeneration by a combination of corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin and antiepileptic drugs  <cit> . similarly, and although it is clear from sod1-linked fals that all the alterations detected in als can have a common root and are therefore interrelated, therapy of als might also require combined medication to combat disease progression at multiple fronts. many of the potential targets of this battle have been outlined by this study.
