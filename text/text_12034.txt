BACKGROUND
the long-term study of wild vertebrate populations, whereby individuals are studied throughout their life histories, has provided enormous opportunity to understand a range of evolutionary and ecological questions  <cit> . cavity-dwelling passerine birds have provided an ideal system for long-term study because they can be caught and handled easily, can be marked, tracked and measured from hatching to death, have short generation times and are sensitive to environmental change. a wealth of quantitative genetic studies have demonstrated a genetic basis for many of the life history traits commonly measured for passerines such as body size, timing of breeding and clutch size  <cit> . however, identifying the genomic regions which contribute to variation between individuals and between populations has, until very recently, been restricted by the lack of genetic resources in wild species  <cit> .

the genomics era has provided an unprecedented explosion in the amount of sequence data available  <cit> . recent advances in genomics, in particular next generation sequencing, mean that generating sequence data for non-model organisms has become accessible both in terms of timescale and price  <cit> . the integration of classical quantitative genetic studies with genomic data therefore provide an exciting opportunity for molecular ecologists to begin to understand the processes governing the evolution and maintenance of quantitative trait variation in wild populations.

the great tit  is a small  cavity nesting passerine species widespread and abundant in woodland across eurasia. as they are highly amenable to using nest boxes, great tits have become a model study organism in behavioural ecology and evolutionary biology, particularly with regard to studying the evolutionary ecology of life history and morphological traits such as clutch size  <cit> , lifetime fitness  <cit> , fledgling mass and adult body mass  <cit> . more recently, quantitative genetic approaches have been extended to examine phenotypic plasticity in response to climate change  <cit> , the heritability of personality traits  <cit>  and reproductive senescence  <cit> .

wytham woods, near oxford, united kingdom, has been the site of a continuous long-term study of great tits since the late 1940s, with nest boxes for great tits first erected in  <dig>  <cit> . the birds have been intensively monitored, with basic morphological characteristics , age, sampling origin within the woods and  pedigree relationships recorded for most individuals since the early 1960s. in addition, there is extensive information regarding life history traits such as breeding attempts, first egg date, egg mass, clutch size, hatching date, hatching success, fledging success, fledging size and recruitment success for those birds that recruit to the breeding population . more recent phenotyping projects have included measuring basal metabolic rate, personality  <cit> , malarial infection and social network data for small subsets of individuals . finally, blood has been sampled and stored for the majority of individuals alive since  <dig>  and for a subset of individuals alive between  <dig> and  <dig>  the combination of extensive phenotypic data, pedigree information and blood samples  available from the wytham woods population provides tremendous opportunity to integrate the findings of previous 'classical' quantitative genetic studies of traits such as clutch size, body mass and personality in this species with quantitative trait locus  mapping to locate the regions of the genome contributing to variation in these traits  <cit> . such mapping requires development of a set of markers spaced evenly across the genome. next generation sequencing provides an efficient method for large-scale single nucleotide polymorphism  discovery  <cit> , either by sequencing whole or partial genome  sequences or by sequencing transcript  libraries generated from mrna. transcriptome sequencing  enables, in addition to snp discovery,  the assembly and analysis of gene sequences likely to be contributing to key differences between individuals,  analysis of tissue-specific gene expression,  a greater depth of sequence coverage than would be possible from whole genome sequencing,  the ability to infer the function of genes through comparative genomics and annotation,  the ability to find snps in known genes, including those that result in a change of protein,  the ability to examine rates of molecular evolution in coding sequences, and  the opportunity to test whether snps that explain phenotypic variation are in genes that show evidence of adaptive evolution between species. however, cdna sequencing fails to cover regions of the genome that lacks genes, and because mrna sequences are present in highly variable copy numbers within the cell, analysis is generally biased towards genes which are highly expressed. while normalisation of mrna pools before sequencing enhances the probability of sequencing rare transcripts, including alternative splice variants, and gives the opportunity to infer elements of gene structure such as exon-intron boundaries, it restricts downstream analyses of transcript abundance. transcriptome sequencing therefore complements whole or partial genome sequencing approaches.

despite their prevalence in evolutionary and ecological studies, until recently the great tit had few genetic resources available, with only twenty two microsatellite markers cloned from the species and fewer than fifty full or partial gene sequences deposited in the ncbi nucleotide database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore. however, in  <dig> over two billion base pairs of genomic sequence was generated from ten great tits sampled from two populations in the netherlands. the sequences were assembled into  <dig>  contigs that cover an estimated  <dig> % of the great tit genome  <cit> . in addition, the same research group has recently completed a low-coverage whole genome sequence of a single individual . to complement this recently derived genomic sequence data, we have generated high read depth transcriptomic sequence data from the wytham woods population. in this paper, the sequencing, de novo assembly and analysis of the great tit transcriptome is described, highlighting the power and speed at which next generation sequencing enables the generation of sequence data in a wild species.

RESULTS
sequencing and assembly
a total of  <dig> , <dig> sequences with a combined length of  <dig>  billion bases were sequenced. read lengths averaged  <dig> bases, with a maximum length of  <dig>  bases . pooling and trimming the sequences left a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads for de novo assembly into contigs. the final ngen assembly  yielded  <dig>  contigs with four or more sequences, utilising  <dig> , <dig>  of the trimmed sequences. the mean contig length was  <dig> bases and the total length of assembled contigs was  <dig> , <dig> bases. despite normalisation of transcripts before sequencing, there was a large range  in the mean coverage depth of contigs , with overall mean coverage depth  of  <dig> x. the total number of sequences contributing to contigs was also highly variable, with a maximum of  <dig> , and was relatively weakly correlated with the contig length . the mean  and median number of sequences per contig was  <dig>  and  <dig> respectively. the  <dig> , <dig> sequences not included in contigs  had mean length  <dig> bases, making them shorter than the sequences included in contigs  .





most contigs were not expressed in every tissue .  <dig>   contigs were only expressed in one tissue  and  <dig>   contigs were expressed in all tissues. the remaining 68% were expressed in more than one, but not all tissues. skin and testes seemed to have a relatively large number of highly tissue specific contigs .

note that relatively few contigs were expressed at very high level in only one tissue , the mean number of reads was  <dig> for contigs with τ <  <dig>  and  <dig> for contigs with τ ≥  <dig> 

transcriptome analysis
blast against zebra finch, chicken and self
most contig sequences mapped to the zebra finch  and chicken  genomes but only around 1/ <dig> aligned with sequences in the zebra finch and chicken transcriptome databases . the divergence between chicken and passerines is thought to have occurred over  <dig> mya while between zebra finch and great tit the divergence is ca.  <dig> mya  <cit> . the great tit genome has 2n =  <dig> chromosomes  <cit>  and, given the relative stability of avian chromosomes , it is expected that the great tit genome is similar in size  to the zebra finch  <cit> . the majority of the contigs that aligned with zebra finch cdna also aligned to chicken cdna records . only  <dig>   contigs did not align with any of the zebra finch or chicken genome, cdna or protein sequences; the mean length of these contigs was  <dig> bases so they were not unusually short. approximately 54% of the sequences in the zebra finch cdna database  and 49% of the sequences in the chicken cdna database  matched great tit contigs suggesting that at least half of the previously known bird transcripts are represented in the assembled great tit contigs. the discordance between the number of contigs and the number of unique sequences they aligned with is due to multiple contigs mapping to the same gene. given that the zebra finch cdna database is  <dig>  mbp and the summed length of the reads contributing to contigs aligning with zebra finch cdna sequences is  <dig>  mbp we estimate an overall transcriptome coverage of ~25×. this figure is lower than a predicted coverage of 41×  due to the low proportion of contigs aligning with zebra finch cdna.

the number of unique sequences in the zebra finch/chicken database  that matched contigs  are also shown. genomic dna hits were not classified as unique if they were located less than  <dig> bases from any other hit

of the ten most highly expressed contigs , six aligned to sequences in the zebra finch and/or chicken cdna databases. these genes were pleckstrin homology domain-containing family b member  <dig> , tho complex subunit  <dig> , ef-hand domain-containing protein , diamine acetyltransferase  <dig>  breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance protein  <dig>  and cadherin- <dig> precursor . contigs mapping to zebra finch or chicken cdna and with mean coverage depth greater than  <dig> are shown in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

a small number of contigs aligned across most of their length to other contigs in the great tit assembly; blastclust grouped  <dig> contigs into  <dig> groups  where there was similarity of 95% across all of the shortest contig. relaxing the blastclust conditions slightly to a similarity of 95% across 95% of the shortest contig clustered  <dig>  contigs into  <dig>  groups . given that the alignments are continuous across the shortest contig, there is no evidence to suggest that contigs within a cluster represent splice variants or that one or more of the contigs are pre-mrna sequences. there is also little evidence to suggest that contigs within a cluster are expressed differentially in different tissues-for groups of two contigs the average correlation of tissue expression is  <dig>  . of the  <dig> pairs,  <dig> mapped to different genomic locations, suggesting that these contigs are paralogues. the remainder of contig pairs appear likely to represent different haplotypes of the same genomic region.

contigs were also blasted against themselves to identify contigs which did not necessarily share sequence homology across their entire length. a large number  of reciprocal pairs of contigs were identified which aligned with e-value less than 10- <dig>  of these, a very large number  were single alignments, suggesting regions of shared protein domains across different genes. five percent of single alignments extended over more than 95% of the shortest contig and, as expected, the set of single alignments included the  <dig> pairs identified by the blastclust analysis. twenty-two percent  of reciprocal pairs of contigs had multiple alignments rather than a single alignment. in a sample of  <dig> pairs of contigs with multiple alignments,  <dig> aligned disjointly , suggesting the two contigs may represent alternative splice variants, or one may be a pre-mrna sequence. there were  <dig>  contigs in one or more reciprocal pairs with multiple alignments, so a relatively large proportion  of the overall contig set may represent alternative mrna or pre-mrna sequences.

the overall contig distribution across zebra finch chromosomes is reasonably uniform across the genome , although some regions of very high expression are evident . there is a reasonable correlation between the distribution of contigs and the distribution of zebra finch genes across the genome . there was no relationship between chromosome length and contig density . the mean contig density across chromosomes  is  <dig> contigs per mbp. despite a higher gene density on zebra finch microchromosomes  <cit> , there was no evidence to suggest that the density of contigs mapping to microchromosomes -and macrochromosomes  differed . no contigs aligned with chromosomes tgu- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  and one contig containing  <dig> reads aligned with tgulg <dig> . tgu- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and tgulg <dig> have a combined length of  <dig> % of the genome and contain  <dig> % of annotated zebra finch genes; it appears likely that by chance these chromosomes have remained unsampled.

the consensus great tit contig sequences contained  <dig> % unambiguous bases  and  <dig> % ambiguous bases . the mean gc content of the unambiguous bases in the great tit assembly is  <dig> %. the mean gc content in the zebra finch and chicken cdna databases is  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively, while the mean genome gc content of the zebra finch and chicken genomes is  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. the gc content for regions of alignment between great tit contigs  and zebra finch cdna sequences  are similar. however, extending the calculation across the whole contig and the whole zebra finch gene it aligns to gives mean gc contents of  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. these figures suggest that either the great tit has an unusually low gc content or that, if it is assumed that the great tit transcriptome has a similar gc content to zebra finch and chicken, the set of great tit contigs may contain genomic as well as transcriptomic sequence-i.e., that some contigs contain intronic or non-transcribed  sequences.

gene ontologies
the distribution of go terms from the tissue-specific contigs into the three domains  is shown in table  <dig>  note that in general the total number of go terms is greater than the number of unique contigs, as many of the contigs map to zebra finch genes with more than one associated go term. of the  <dig>  contigs aligning with zebra finch cdna sequences, go terms could be extracted for  <dig>   of the contigs. there were  <dig>  contigs with go terms expressed in all tissues and  <dig>  tissue-specific contigs with go terms . many of the go terms from tissue-specific contigs were found in more than one tissue . the tissue-unique go terms  are listed in additional file  <dig>  table s2; a total of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> go terms were uniquely associated with contigs only expressed in brain, heart, kidney, liver, muscle, pancreas, skin and testes, respectively, while  <dig>  go terms were uniquely associated with contigs expressed in all tissues. a total of  <dig> tissue-unique go terms were also highly tissue specific  . interestingly, it was heart and pancreas that had the highest number of highly tissue specific go terms , and of the seven terms with τ >  <dig> , four were unique to heart , two to pancreas  and one to skin . the tissue specificity of these go terms generally appears biologically consistent, although it is interesting to note, for example, two "ovarian" go terms associated with testes-ovarian cumulus expansion and ovulation cycle, and two "respiratory" go terms associated with heart-bronchus morphogenesis and trachea formation . such tissue overlap may reflect  alignment of a contig to a protein which shares a conserved domain but has a different function.



contigs were assigned into the three go domains  through 'is_a' pedigree mapping. the number of unique go terms is also reported for each tissue

the three go domains  have  <dig> immediate child terms . of the sixty-five terms,  <dig> were not represented in any of the 'is_a' mappings, two were associated with only one tissue , and the remaining  <dig> were all parents of unique go terms expressed in all tissues . for combined 'is_a' and 'part_of' relationships, the same two go terms were uniquely associated with brain and muscle, but only  <dig> were not represented in any of the "is_a" or "part_of" mappings, namely carbohydrate, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sugar, and sulfur utilization , chemoattractant, chemorepellent, electron carrier and nutrient reservoir activity and protein tag  and symplast, virion and virion part . the remaining  <dig> terms were expressed in all tissues -i.e., seven go terms mapped through only 'part_of' and not 'is_a' mappings-cell killing, cell wall organization or biogenesis, reproduction and viral reproduction  and cell, extracellular region and extracellular region part  . these results indicate that although there is evidence for highly tissue specific expression of  <dig>  contigs , the go annotations find only a few tissue-specific functions for these contigs .

mapping non-gene contigs
we further investigated the  <dig>  contigs that mapped to the zebra finch genome but did not match anything in the zebra finch cdna database. approximately two thirds of contigs mapped either up or downstream of a gene . of the remainder, the vast majority  were class f, whereby the contig mapped entirely within the boundaries of the genome location of a known gene, although  <dig> contigs extended across the entire gene sequence . there are similar numbers of contigs in classes a  and b , and approximately 30% of these contigs align to locations within  <dig>  bases of a mapped gene . the distribution of the distance of class a and b contigs from their nearest gene differed significantly from the random distribution generated from  <dig> , <dig> simulated contigs . in other words, class a and class b contigs are closer to genes than expected from the sequencing of random genomic dna, implying that the majority of these "non-gene" contigs are either gene sequences or closely associated with gene sequences  rather than erroneously amplified genomic sequence.

contigs are shown in grey while genes are in black

 <dig> class c contigs align to genes with a mean of  <dig>  exons , 18% of genes have only one exon

 <dig> class d contigs align to genes with a mean of  <dig>  exons , 20% of genes have only one exon

 <dig>  <dig> contigs extend from 5'  to 3'  of the closest mapped gene and one contig extends from the start position  of the closest gene to 3' of the gene. all genes have only one exon

 <dig> class f contigs align to genes with a mean of  <dig>  exons , 87% of genes have more than five exons

 <dig> for example, the start and end of the contig are both within the 5' utr

 <dig> for example, the start of the contig aligns within exon  <dig> and the end of the contig aligns within intron 1

a small number of class a and b contigs aligned with non-coding rna sequences. of the  <dig> non coding rna sequences described in the zebra finch genome, including micro, ribosomal, small nucleolar and small nuclear rna,  <dig> contigs aligned to  <dig> unique non-coding rna sequences. twenty two of the non-coding rna contigs mapped within  <dig>  bases of a gene, suggesting that these non-coding rnas may be involved in modulating the expression of the nearby gene. only ten of the  <dig> non-coding rnas have an associated gene name and description, six of which are small nucleolar rnas. however, it is likely that there are many more than  <dig> non-coding rna sequences in the zebra finch  genomes;  <dig>  have been described in zebrafish  and  <dig>  in human . thus, at least a few hundred of the class a and b contigs may represent non-coding rna.

the distribution of the distance between all contigs mapping to the zebra finch genome  also differed significantly from the distribution expected at random .

for most class c contigs, alignments begin in the final exon of the gene, while for most class d contigs alignments end in the first exon . all genes enclosed by class e contigs contain a single exon and tend to be small . in class f, the vast majority  of contigs aligned within a single intron . two hundred and sixty contigs aligned across more than one gene feature, with 57% of alignments beginning in an intron, and 58% of alignments ending in an intron . thus, the overwhelming majority of class f contigs align with intronic regions of a zebra finch gene, providing very strong support that these contigs represent pre-mrna . the mean number of reads per contig for the  <dig>  class c, d, e and f contigs which align to intronic regions was 14; this differed significantly , from the mean  for the  <dig>  contigs which aligned with sequences in the zebra finch cdna database . therefore pre-mrnas are much less abundant than mrna sequences.

metagenomics of non-great tit sequences
of the  <dig>  contigs which did not align with any zebra finch or chicken genome, cdna or protein sequences,  <dig> aligned to refseq rna sequences. of these,  <dig> aligned to vertebrate_birds, suggesting they are likely to represent true great tit sequences. of the remaining  <dig> contigs that did not align to vertebrate_birds,  <dig> aligned to another vertebrate group , suggesting that these contigs represent great tit genes without an annotated vertebrate_bird homologue in the refseq rna database. a further  <dig> contigs aligned with species from two or more kingdoms, and alignments were typically short  or did not span more than 20% of the contig sequence. of the remaining  <dig> contigs which aligned with species from a single kingdom, one aligned with bacterial species, and  <dig> with plant species. the 'bacterial' contig aligned with  <dig> different bacterial genera. the remaining  <dig> contigs aligned with populus trichocarpa , or both p. trichocarpa and sorghum bicolor  sequences, and appear most likely to represent non-great tit sequences. the two s. bicolor alignments and two of the p. trichocarpa alignments were shorter than  <dig> bases and covered less than 12% of the contig, suggesting the alignments are unlikely to represent populus or sorghum but may be plant contamination of some kind. note that while p. trichocarpa and s. bicolor are model species with full genome  sequences, sequences from trees common in the ecology of the great tit  are not well represented in the refseq rna database. eleven of the remaining twelve contigs were assembled from skin reads, and the other from a combination of skin and testes reads. the remaining alignments with p. trichocarpa were of reasonable length  and identity , suggesting there may be sequences from a plant species related to p. trichocarpa in the great tit assembly .

alignments with 'environmental' sequences  provide some evidence to suggest that the great tit assembly includes sequences from flea and tick . forty-six contigs aligned with ribosomal rna sequences from ixodes ricinus. twenty-eight contigs aligned with ribosomal rna sequences from ceratophyllus ciliatus , with some but not all of these contigs also aligning with sequences from the hen flea ceratophyllus gallinae. however, contigs aligning to ceratophyllus ciliatus and to ixodes ricinus showed no evidence of tissue specificity; all ten of the most significant contig alignments with c. ciliatus were expressed in two or more tissues. similarly all ten of the most significant contig alignments with i. ricinus were expressed in two or more tissues. of the  <dig> , <dig> singletons not assembled into contig sequences,  <dig>  aligned with  <dig> 'environmental' sequences. alignments with flea  and tick  sequences were the most prevalent , in addition there were  <dig> alignments with badger -hair from which is frequently incorporated into nests-and  <dig> with beech . thus, there is limited evidence that small amounts of rna from other species have been included in the great tit sequences. there was little evidence to suggest that the great tit assembly includes sequences from any common endoparasites, nor from the great tit's common food source the winter moth .

microsatellite repeat discovery
sputnik detected  <dig>  repeats of between two and five bases with five or more repeat units in  <dig>  contigs . the total sequence length of di-, tri-, tetra-and penta-nucleotide repeats with more than five repeat units represents approximately  <dig> % of the total assembled contig sequences. fifty-five of the repeats matched   <dig> passerine microsatellites isolated from  <dig> different species. all di-, tri-, tetra-and penta-nucleotides with at least  <dig> repeat units, along with up to  <dig> bases total flanking sequence, are listed in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

snp discovery
of an initial  <dig> , <dig> snps identified by seqman ngen,  <dig>  'high' and  <dig>  'modest' quality snps were detected in  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs respectively. the majority of the loss of snps was due to exclusion of snps with a minor allele count of less than three . of the filtered snps,  <dig>   high and  <dig>   modest quality snps were confirmed by re-assembling pooled and trimmed sequences onto the consensus great tit assembly sequences. although 35% of all great tit contigs align with zebra finch cdna , 46% of contigs containing high quality snps and 49% of contigs containing modest quality snps aligned with zebra finch cdna. the reading frame of  <dig>  high and  <dig>  modest quality snps could be inferred from regions of alignment between zebra finch genes and the snp-containing contig. of these,  <dig>   of high and  <dig>   of modest quality snps caused non-synonymous substitutions while the remainder were not predicted to cause a change in the amino acid sequence . both the number of snps and the number of microsatellites mapping to zebra finch chromosomes were highly correlated with the total length of these chromosomes , and the overall distribution of microsatellites and snps is reasonably uniform across the genome .

alternative splicing
three hundred and thirty-two contigs  contained 'strings' of at least six snps, suggesting these contigs are likely to include reads from alternative splice variants . of these,  <dig> contained only one snp string. all but  <dig> of these contigs aligned with the zebra finch genome, and  <dig> aligned to a mapped gene. contigs containing snp strings were expressed in more tissues than contigs without snp strings  and were also less tissue specific  than contigs without snp strings . this difference was smaller but still significant once contig length and the number of reads mapping to the contig was taken into account . although two of the alternative splice contigs were expressed in only one tissue , two hundred and sixty two  of the  <dig> alternative splice contigs were expressed in all eight tissues. these results suggest that it is uncommon  for a single tissue to generate more than one splice variant, and that for those alternative splice contigs expressed in more than one tissue, different tissues may be generating different alternative splice variants.

discussion
the sequencing of the great tit transcriptome represents an exciting application of next generation sequencing technology to the genome of a species which, until recently  <cit> , had very few genetic resources. although the downstream analysis of the great tit assembly was vastly enhanced by the availability of both zebra finch   <cit>  and chicken   <cit>  complete genome sequences, the assembly of  <dig> reads was possible without a reference genome  due to both the length of sequences  and the high coverage . the resultant great tit transcriptome assembly of  <dig>  contigs, encompassing  <dig> , <dig> bases, is a valuable tool for future genomic work in this and other closely related species, in particular for molecular evolution studies  <cit>  and to enable the development of a panel of markers for qtl mapping and genome wide association studies. this illustrates the power of next generation sequencing to begin to illuminate the genetic architecture and evolution of quantitative traits at a genomic level in non-model and wild species.

as illustrated by the number of high quality snps detected, transcriptome or genomic sequencing is also a rapid method for detecting variation in a population. in addition to snps, the microsatellites identified in the transcriptome are a useful resource, as they provide new markers for this species. by seeing which of these markers are also found in the zebra finch assembly, it should be possible to determine which are the most conserved microsatellites in passerines. such conserved microsatellites provide a good system for studying microsatellite evolution without any biases due to them being cloned in one species. finally, because the microsatellites documented here are in or close to genes  or map to within  <dig>  bp of a gene ), they are ideal markers for candidate gene studies or other population genetic studies requiring a modest number of variable markers which are uniformly distributed across the genome.

mapping the great tit contigs to the zebra finch and chicken cdna databases resulted in around one third of contigs aligning with known genes, despite almost all contigs aligning to the zebra finch and chicken genomes . given that all sequences were sequenced from complementary dna, it seems surprising that a larger proportion of contigs did not match known genes. a number of possible explanations why some contigs did not map to known genes include:  the contigs are great tit genes without homologues in zebra finch or chicken,  they are contigs of great tit genes which are highly divergent from their zebra finch and chicken homologues and therefore do not match in a blast search,  they are non-great tit sequences,  they are from genes which are unannotated in both zebra finch and chicken and  they are sequences of preprocessed mrna .

it is very possible that a small number of contigs are either great-tit specific genes  or have undergone substantial sequence evolution since the divergence of zebra finch and great tit 40- <dig> million years ago , but this explanation cannot account for most of the contigs that did not match the cdna databases, because these contigs still matched genomic sequences. for the same reason, it appears highly unlikely that a substantial proportion of the contigs represent non-great tit sequences . given the comprehensive annotation of the chicken genome in particular, it also seems improbable that many contigs are as-yet unidentified genes . the most intriguing explanation is that a high proportion of the non-gene contigs represent pre-mrna . of the contigs which did not align with zebra finch genes but did align with regions of the genome, many aligned to regions very close to genes. further, many of the 'non-cdna' contigs aligned within intronic regions, providing strong support that these contigs encode pre-mrna rather than mrna sequences.

normalisation of the mrna library prior to cdna synthesis and sequencing is likely to have contributed to the presence of pre-mrna sequences in the great tit assembly, due to the amplification of low copy number transcripts. the read depth of contigs identified as likely pre-mrna transcripts is substantially lower than the read depth for contigs aligning with zebra finch genes , suggesting that without normalisation the difference would be even larger. thus, pre-mrna sequences are less likely to be sequenced  in non-normalised studies. however, the ability to align contigs to an assembled genome sequence  and use this information to annotate contigs as mrna, pre-mrna and alternatively spliced transcripts provides a valuable tool. even in the absence of an assembled genome to align to, it may be possible to align contigs with each other and infer elements of gene structure such as exon-intron boundaries . indeed, the presence of contigs covering non-coding regions may actually offer some advantages for downstream applications. in particular, it is now possible to type snps with different properties-for example, snps which map to intronic, 5' utr, 3' utr, and intergenic regions are valuable "neutral" contrasts to synonymous or non-synonymous snps located within coding regions, which are likely to be under stronger selection.

the high number of pairs of contigs with multiple blast alignments, compared to the number of contigs with snp strings, suggests that the assembly software usually splits splice variants into discrete contigs, rather than combining sequences from multiple splice variants into one contig . our results may underestimate the overall number of alternatively spliced genes in the transcriptome; recent estimates suggest that at least half of all mammalian genes with more than one exon may be alternatively spliced  <cit> . one explanation for the small proportion of contigs identified as potential alternatively spliced genes is that contigs do not necessarily cover the total gene sequence, and different contigs may map to different parts of the same gene. thus, signals of alternative splicing such as snp 'strings' may be relatively rare given the overall coverage of the transcriptome. on the other hand, a large number of sequences  were not assembled; it may also be possible that some of these sequences represent minor splice variants which have not been sequenced with sufficient depth to have been assembled into contigs. an exciting area for future research would be to examine splice variants in more detail; for example, looking to see if different types of genes  have evolved to have splice variants more often than others.

CONCLUSIONS
by describing and mining the transcriptome of a wild bird population we have facilitated future evolutionary genomics studies in this species. genome-wide association studies, using snps in known genes, will pave the way for qtl discovery and insight into microevolutionary processes. similarly, comparison of great tit coding regions with homologous regions in other sequenced bird species  will make it possible to identify genes with elevated rates of molecular evolution. by combining and integrating data from these two discrete types of analysis, it will be possible to investigate whether the same genes are relevant to micro and macro-evolutionary processes. in summary, next generation sequencing of the great tit transcriptome has paved the way to convert a classical ecological organism into one with a genetic toolkit.
