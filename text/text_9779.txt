BACKGROUND
transcriptional regulation plays an important role in the bacterial response to environmental stresses. antibacterial drugs are deemed to be atypical stressors, and changes in transcriptional regulation can increase bacterial drug resistance  <cit> . when exposed to such drugs, bacteria can undergo complex responses, such as inactivating the targets, modifying the drugs, or expressing drug efflux system proteins. today, more than  <dig> transporter proteins have been found to be associated with tetracycline efflux systems  <cit> . bacterial drug efflux pumps can efflux drugs out of the cell, thereby lowering the drug concentration, and up-regulating the expression of membrane drug efflux pump proteins is the key mechanism by which bacteria increase their drug resistance  <cit> . five different categories of drug transporters have been investigated: the atp-binding cassette  superfamily, the major facilitator superfamily , the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion  family, the small multidrug resistance  family, and the resistance/nodulation/cell division  family  <cit> .

mfs members are widespread, and they play important roles in drug transport in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans  <cit> . the mfs was first found to transport glucide, and, subsequently, drugs, phosphates, and oligosaccharides  <cit> . an mfs permease is directly involved in the bacterial drug efflux process  <cit> . some bacterial transcription regulatory proteins, such as bacillus subtilis bmrr, staphylococcus aureus qacr, and mycobacterium smegmatis lfra, can regulate the expression of drug transporters by acting either as transcriptional repressors or activators of drug efflux genes . however, our knowledge of the transcriptional factors that regulate anti-mycobacterial drug transporter-related genes is still limited.

mycobacterium smegmatis is a relatively fast-growing and non-pathogenic mycobacterium, and it is frequently used as a model organism to study the gene regulatory mechanisms of m. tuberculosis  <cit> . notably, the genome of m. tuberculosis encodes at least  <dig> possible drug efflux transporters  <cit> . some of these transporter proteins play a role in mycobacterial resistance to isoniazid , rifampicin , tetracycline, and other antibiotics . in comparison with m. tuberculosis, m. smegmatis has more drug efflux systems and transcription factors; however, the mechanisms by which they are regulated are largely unknown.

gntr family transcription factors, which are named after a gluconate operon repressor in b. subtilis, are widely distributed in bacteria  <cit> . gntr members contain a conserved n-terminal helix-turn-helix  domain for dna-binding and diverse c-terminal domains  <cit> . the variable c-terminal domain provides the basis for their classification into six subfamilies. except for ms <dig>  a global cu2+-responsive transcription factor  <cit> , members of the gntr/fadr subfamily have been rarely reported in m. smegmatis. gntr family members usually function as transcriptional repressors, although some of them are transcriptional activators. for instance, serratia marcescens pigt  <cit> , enterococcus faecalis cito  <cit> , fadr  <cit> , and mcbr/yncc  <cit>  from escherichia coli, norg from staphylococcus aureus  <cit> , hpxs from klebsiella pneumoniae  <cit> , and b. subtilis gabr  <cit>  were shown to act as transcriptional activators or repressor/activators.

in this study, we have shown that a gntr family transcription factor, encoded by the ms <dig> gene, plays a role in m. smegmatis drug resistance. ms <dig> specifically bound its own promoter by recognizing a 26-bp palindromic sequence motif that is separated by four nucleotides. it regulates m. smegmatis inh resistance by functioning as a transcriptional activator that regulates the expression of the mfs permease gene ms <dig>  which is located in the same operon. this is the first study to clarify the regulatory mechanism of the transcriptional factor ms <dig> and its role in m. smegmatis inh resistance.

RESULTS
mycobacterium smegmatis ms <dig> potentially contributes to mycobacterial inh resistance
to identify potential transcription factors that regulate drug resistance in m. smegmatis, we screened a transcriptional regulator library by spotting these recombinant strains onto plates containing inh . about  <dig> predicted regulatory genes in the genome of the m. smegmatis strain mc <dig>  were cloned into pmv <dig>  and the recombinant plasmids were transformed into m. smegmatis. transformant strains were spotted onto 7h <dig> medium containing 20 μg/ml inh. the recombinant plasmids were isolated from the inh-resistant m. smegmatis transformants, which enabled the positive regulator genes to be characterized by sequencing.

a hypothetical transcriptional factor, encoded by the ms <dig> gene, was isolated as a potential contributor to inh resistance in m. smegmatis. as shown in fig. 1a, the mycobacterial strain transformed with pmv261-ms <dig>  which overexpresses ms <dig>  was more resistant to 20 μg/ml inh than the wild-type strain transformed with the empty pmv <dig> vector . the evidence suggested that ms <dig> is potentially involved in regulating inh drug resistance in m. smegmatis. a sequence analysis revealed that ms <dig> contains an n-terminal winged hth dna-binding domain and a typical all-helical c-terminal domain belonging to the fadr subfamily  <cit> . the absence of the first α-helix indicates that ms <dig> encodes a vanr-like regulator .fig.  <dig> the effect of ms <dig> on the drug resistance of m. smegmatis and a sequence alignment of the ms <dig> c-terminal domain.  isoniazid -resistance of the m. smegmatis  strain overexpressing ms <dig>  msm/pmv <dig> and msm/pmv261-ms <dig> were grown on medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin for 36 h. then, different concentrations of freshly grown bacteria were streaked onto 7h <dig> plates containing kanamycin  and inh . the control plate did not contain inh.  analysis of the structural characteristics of ms <dig>  the ms <dig> amino acid sequence was analyzed using the online tool swiss-model. the n-terminal region of ms <dig> contains a winged helix-turn-helix gntr dna-binding domain, while its c-terminus contains a domain that is similar to that of the fcd family. amino acid residues present in α-helices are highlighted in gray, and spaces in the consensus sequence denote insertions within the alignment



ms <dig> binds its own promoter
several assays were performed to detect the dna binding activity of ms <dig>  first, a bacterial one-hybrid system  <cit>  was used to detected protein-dna interactions. the promoter region  of ms <dig>  ms0535p, and the unrelated promoter ms0540p  were cloned into the reporter vector pbxcmt  <cit>  and co-transformed into reporter strains with ptrg-ms <dig>  co-transformants of both the positive control ptrg-rv3133c/pbx-rv2031p, as well as ptrg-ms0535/pbx-ms0535p, grew very well in the screening medium . in contrast, no growth was observed for the self-activated controls and the negative control . thus, ms <dig> can bind to its promoter, ms0535p.fig.  <dig> ms <dig> specifically binds to its own promoter.  bacterial one-hybrid assays. promoters of the ms <dig> and ms <dig> genes were cloned into the pbxcmt vector, and the ms <dig> gene was cloned into the ptrg vector. a pair of pbxcmt/ptrg plasmids was co-transformed into the reporter strain, and then its growth was tested together with the self-activation controls on a selective medium. co-transformants containing the pbx-rv2031/ptrg-rv <dig> plasmids  <cit>  served as positive controls , and co-transformants containing the empty vectors pbxcmt and ptrg served as negative controls .  electrophoretic mobility shift assays . the ms0535p  and ms0540p  dna substrates were co-incubated with various amounts of the ms <dig> protein. the free dna substrate and dna-protein complexes are indicated.  emsas for the specific binding of ms <dig> to its own promoter. then,  <dig>  nm of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled ms <dig> promoter dna substrate was co-incubated with the ms <dig> protein in the absence  or presence of non-labeled ms0535p   or non-labeled ms0540p  . unlabeled ms <dig> and unlabeled ms <dig> promoter dna substrates were used to compete with the labeled ms <dig> promoter dna. the ms <dig> promoter, but not the ms <dig> promoter, inhibited the binding of ms <dig> to the labeled ms <dig> promoter dna substrate



second, electrophoretic mobility shift assays  were conducted to show that ms <dig> binds to ms0535p in vitro. as shown in fig. 2b,  <dig>  nm of the ms0535p dna substrate was co-incubated with different amounts  of his-tagged ms <dig> protein, and clear band shifts were observed, indicating the formation of dna-protein complexes . in contrast, ms <dig> did not bind to the ms0540p negative control promoter . additionally, a competition assay was performed. unlabeled ms0535p and ms0540p promoters were used to compete with labeled ms0535p, and ms0535p, but not ms0540p, could competitively inhibit the binding of ms <dig> to the labeled ms0535p promoter .fig.  <dig> dna-binding motif assays for ms <dig>   dye primer sequencing based on a dnase i footprinting assay. the ms <dig> promoter dna was digested with dnasei in the presence of increasing amounts of ms <dig>  the protected regions are indicated by a black frame.  sequence and structural characteristics of the protected ms <dig> promoter region. the regions protected by ms <dig> are underlined. the binding motif is a 26-bp sequence containing invert repeats  with a 4-bp spacer. the translational start codon of ms <dig> is indicated in bold.  electrophoretic mobility shift assays of the dna-binding activity of ms <dig> towards dna substrates with  or without  the ir sequences. the dna substrates were individually incubated with 0–4 μm of the ms <dig> protein.  analysis of the domain structure of ms <dig> and the genomic location of its dna binding motif. the ms <dig> gene encodes a typical gntr regulator, and it shares a common upstream promoter region with the major facilitator superfamily permease ms <dig>  the distance between the motif and the coding sequence of ms <dig> is 18 bp



these findings strongly suggest that ms <dig> can specifically bind to its own promoter, ms0535p.

ms <dig> recognizes a palindromic sequence motif
to identify the dna-binding site for ms <dig>  a dnase i footprinting assay was performed as described previously  <cit> . the results showed that ms <dig> protected the sequence 5′-ccttgcatgcattcttgcatgcaagg-3′ in the ms0535p promoter . the protected dna region extended from positions − <dig> to − <dig>  in the coding strand . in this region, a palindromic motif formed by two irs , which are separated by 4 nt, was found . to detect binding between ms <dig> and the binding motif, short oligonucleotides were synthesized, and emsas were conducted. in the experiments, the wild-type motif and three mutants were included . the results showed that ms <dig> bound the wild-type ms0535p <dig> substrate, resulting in shifted bands . in addition, ms <dig> also bound to ms0535p <dig> and ms0535p <dig>  in which one ir was mutated . in contrast, ms <dig> did not bind the ms0535p <dig> fragment, in which both irs were mutated . interestingly, when ms <dig> bound to ms0535p <dig> and ms0535p <dig>  the single ir mutants, only one shifted band was observed , suggesting that ms <dig> may bind the promoter in two steps.

in conclusion, these results indicate that ms <dig> recognizes a 26-bp palindromic sequence motif.

the ms <dig> and ms <dig> genes reside in an ms0534- <dig> operon
because ms <dig> binds to a 26-bp sequence motif in the upstream region of its own promoter, we created a system to locate the putative promoter and to detect the operator region of ms <dig> . a genomic location analysis suggested that ms <dig> shares the same upstream dna region with the mfs permease ms <dig>  subsequent reverse transcription-pcr  assays showed that the two genes were co-transcribed . the cdna used in this experiment was reverse transcribed by a reverse primer that was complementary to a region within the ms <dig> gene. dna fragments encompassing the ms <dig> and ms <dig> genes, as well as the region between the genes, can be amplified from the cdna template. an mrna template and the amplification of an unrelated dna fragment encompassing the ms <dig> gene were used as negative controls. this result suggests that the ms <dig> and ms <dig> genes are co-transcripted and reside in an ms0534-ms <dig> operon in m. smegmatis.fig.  <dig> assays for ms0534-ms <dig> co-transcription by reverse transcription-pcr.  the schematic operon structure of ms0534-ms <dig>  primers designed for the assays are indicated by black arrows; f <dig> primers are complementary to the sequences of the two adjacent genes.  reverse transcription-pcr assays for ms0534-ms <dig> co-transcription. in this assay, the resulting cdna was transcribed by the f <dig> reverse primer. for the f <dig> fragment, mrna  was used as a negative control . in lane  <dig>  a 189-bp reverse transcription-pcr product indicates the co-transcription of ms0534-ms <dig>  the 146-bp f <dig> and 100-bp f <dig> extension products are shown in lanes  <dig> and  <dig>  the negative result in lane  <dig> reveals that the f <dig> fragment cannot be amplified from the cdna template. the pcr procedure was as follows: the reactions underwent 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °c for 30 s, annealing at 60 °c for 30 s, and extension at 72 °c for 30 s



ms <dig> positively regulates its own expression and the expression of ms0534
to characterize the biological function of ms <dig>  we constructed a m. smegmatis ms <dig> knockout strain using a gene replacement strategy . subsequently, the expression of the adjacent gene, ms <dig>  in both the wild-type and ms <dig> deletion strains was compared by quantitative rt-pcr  assays. as shown in fig. 5a, the expression of ms <dig> was significantly down-regulated in the ms <dig> knockout strain compared with that in the wild-type strain. in contrast, the expression of the negative control gene ms <dig>  whose promoter does not contain a conserved binding motif, did not show any obvious changes. this finding suggested that ms <dig> could function as a positive regulator. consistent with this view, when ms <dig> was overexpressed , the expression of ms <dig> was significantly up-regulated . these results indicate that ms <dig> can function as a positive regulator of ms0535/ms <dig> in m. smegmatis.fig.  <dig> quantitative real time-pcr assays. gene expressions were determined in the m. smegmatis ms <dig> deletion strain , in the ms0535-overexpressing strain , and in wild type strain with or without isoniazid . the relative expression levels of the genes were normalized using the siga gene as an invariant transcript. an unrelated promoter of the ms <dig> gene was used as a negative control. data were analyzed using the 2−ΔΔct method as described in the methods. p-values of the relative expression data were calculated by an unpaired two-tailed student’s t-test



as we proved, overexpressing ms <dig> can increase the inh resistance of m. smegmatis. to determine whether inh can affect the expression of ms <dig>  qrt-pcr experiments were performed on the wild-type strain after cultivation in the presence or absence of inh for 6 h . cultivation in the presence of 10 μg/ml inh did not alter the expression of the ms <dig> and ms <dig> genes. however, in the presence of 30 μg/ml inh, the expression of ms <dig> increased by  <dig> -fold relative to bacteria grown in the absence of inh, while ms <dig> expression increased  <dig> -fold. since these differences in expression were not very significant, we concluded that these two genes are not inh-responsive genes, although overexpression of either ms <dig> or ms <dig> increases inh resistance .

ms <dig> regulates m. smegmatis antibiotic resistance via the putative permease ms0534
ms <dig> has been predicted to encode a permease that is possibly involved in drug export. moreover, using the sequence of the ms <dig> dna binding motif as a blast query, no more binding site was found in the m. smegmatis genome, except for the ms0535p promoter. taken together, we hypothesized that ms <dig> should be the effector protein that confers inh resistance in ms0535-overexpressing strains. to test this hypothesis, ms <dig>  and ms <dig> knockout strains , together with multiple complementary strains, were constructed.

we first determined the growth curves of the wild-type and ms0534/ms0535-overexpressing strains. as shown in fig. 6a, the ms0535-overexpressing strain grew much better than the wild-type strain in 7h <dig> medium containing 10 μg/ml inh , but their growth was similar in the absence of inh . comparably, the ms0534-overexpressing strain grew much better than the wild-type strain in the presence , but not in the absence of inh .fig.  <dig> determinations of growth curves of m. smegmatis strains. mycobacterial strains were grown in 7h <dig> medium in the presence of 10 μg/ml isoniazid, and growth curves were determined.  left: the wild-type  and ms0535-overexpressing  strains; right: the wt  and ms0534-overexpressing  strains. to avoid potential side effects, the empty pmv261vector was included in the wt strain.  left: the wt , ms <dig> deletion , and Δms <dig> complemented  strains; right: the wt , ms <dig> deletion , and Δms <dig> complemented  strains. to avoid potential side effects, the empty pmindd vector was included in the wt and ms0534/ms <dig> deletion strains.  left: the ms <dig> deletion  strain and the Δms <dig> strain complemented with ms <dig> ; right: the ms <dig> deletion strain  and the Δms <dig> strain complemented with ms <dig> . to avoid potential side effects, the empty pmv <dig> vector was included in the ms0534/ms <dig> deleted strains. error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates



furthermore, the growth curves of the wild-type, ms <dig> deletion, and complemented strains were determined. as shown in fig. 6b, both the ms <dig>  and ms <dig> deletion strains  were more sensitive to inh, and their sensitivity could be complemented by inducing the expression of ms <dig> or ms <dig>  respectively, using the pmindd system  <cit> . all these strains grew similarly in the absence of inh .

in addition, the ms <dig> deletion strain was complemented with the ms <dig> gene, and the ms <dig> deletion strain was complemented with the ms <dig> gene, and the growth curves of these strains were determined with  or without  inh. as shown in fig. 6c, complementation with the ms <dig> gene improved the growth of the ms <dig> deletion strain . however, complementation with the ms <dig> gene did not improve the growth of the ms <dig> deletion strain .

these results support our hypothesis, and they indicate that ms <dig> regulates inh resistance through ms <dig>  and ms <dig> is the effector protein that confers inh resistance to the ms0535-overexpressing strain.

discussion
in recent decades, bacteria, especially some important pathogens such as m. tuberculosis, exhibiting drug and multi-drug resistance  have become a major health issue worldwide  <cit> . in the current study, we showed that a gntr family transcription factor, encoded by the ms <dig> gene, activates the expression of the efflux pump protein ms <dig>  an mfs permease, thereby affecting the drug resistance of m. smegmatis.

drug efflux pump proteins play an important role in bacterial drug resistance  <cit> . several transcription factors involved in the regulation of these proteins have been characterized . ms <dig>  a global cu2+-responsive gntr family transcription factor, was found to be involved in regulating the expression of  <dig> membrane transport genes, and it was shown to negatively affect mycobacterial drug resistance  <cit> . gntr family transcription factors, which can regulate mdr, antibiotic biosynthesis, cell permeability, and virulence  <cit> , are widely distributed in bacteria  <cit> ; gntr is named after a repressor of the b. subtilis gluconate operon  <cit> . the family members usually function as transcriptional repressors, although there are also reports of gntr activators, such as s. marcescens pigt  <cit> , e. faecalis cito  <cit> , and b. subtilis gabr  <cit> . the genomes of mycobacteria contain a large number of gntr family transcription factors  <cit> , although little is known about the function of the other members of this family. in this study, we isolated and characterized the gntr/fadr subfamily transcriptional factor ms <dig>  which acts as an activator and positively affects drug resistance in m. smegmatis. dnasei footprinting assays and emsas confirmed that ms <dig> specifically recognized a 26-bp palindromic sequence motif, which was separated by 4 nt .

the mfs is one of the major types of bacterial drug efflux pumps, and it plays an important role in bacterial drug efflux  <cit> . the current study showed that most of the mycobacterial drug efflux pumps belong to the mfs. this confirmed that the transporters of the mfs play an important role in mycobacterial drug resistance  <cit> . lfra is a transporter protein that belongs to the mfs, and it is mainly involved in the efflux of eb and acriflavine in bacteria. it is the first drug efflux pump been discovered in m. tuberculosis  <cit> . ms <dig> is a permease that belongs to the mfs. it is located in the same operon as the gntr family transcriptional factor ms <dig>  in this study, we found that ms <dig> activates the expression of ms <dig> . an interesting finding from the present work was the determination that both ms0535- and ms0534-overexpressing mycobacterial strains exhibited higher levels of inh resistance than the wild-type strain . conversely, the ms <dig> and ms <dig> deletion strains were more sensitive to inh than the wild-type strain . furthermore, we found that overexpressing ms <dig> in the ms <dig> deletion strain enhanced mycobacterial inh resistance . however, overexpressing ms <dig> in the ms <dig> deletion strain did not affect inh resistance . this suggests that ms <dig> acts as a transcriptional activator that regulates the expression of the drug efflux pump protein ms <dig>  which positively regulates the drug resistance of m. smegmatis.

it is noteworthy that although the complementation strains grew better than the deletion strains under inh stress, their resistance to inh are still far from the wild-type control . one probable reason for this result is that the corresponding promoter activities are different in the pmindd vector and the m. smegmatis genome. another possibility is that induce of hyg gene may cause polar effect in gene expression. using a scarless gene deletion may avoid this effect by removing antibiotic resistance genes with phage infection  <cit> .

as is well known, inh is active exclusively against mycobacteria, but pathogenic m. tuberculosis and non-pathogenic m. smegmatis display greatly different sensitivities to inh. compared with its activity against m. tuberculosis, inh is  <dig> times less active against m. smegmatis  <cit> . additionally, genomic variations between the two species may also be responsible for this difference. the m. smegmatis genome encodes more than  <dig> potential regulatory factors; however, only  <dig> regulatory factors are encoded by the m. tuberculosis genome. ms <dig> is a gntr family transcription factor encoded by the m. smegmatis genome, while absent in m. tuberculosis. furthermore, its target ms <dig>  a putative permease, is absent in m. tuberculosis as well. according to our results, these two genes may contribute the drug resistance of m. smegmatis and this partially explain the difference in inh resistance between the two mycobacterial species.

studies have shown that mfs proteins can transport molecules such as drugs, glucide, and phosphate  <cit> . consistently, we showed that overexpression of the transcription factor ms <dig> and the mfs permease ms <dig> affects the inh resistance of m. smegmatis. additionally, no potential ms <dig> target genes were identified by searching the m. smegmatis with the sequence of the ms <dig> dna binding motif. this suggests that ms <dig> may transport inh, and that ms <dig> specifically regulates this process.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, a gntr family, vanr-like transcriptional factor, ms <dig>  was shown to be a transcription activator and to positively regulate inh resistance of m. smegmatis. ms <dig> specifically recognized a 26-bp palindromic sequence motif separated by a 4-nt spacer, and it activated its own expression, as well as that of the ms <dig> efflux pump gene in the same operon. our findings establish ms <dig> as a novel gntr family activator in mycobacteria, and they significantly enhance our understanding of the regulatory mechanism of bacterial drug resistance.
