BACKGROUND
n-acetyl-d-neuraminic acid  is the most abundant terminal carbohydrate in glycoconjugates  and has great commercial value. it is an acidic sugar with a prominent role in numerous biological activities, including anti-viral and anti-bacterial defensive functions. neu5ac is the starting material in the manufacture of the anti-influenza virus agent zanamivir   <cit> . to enzymatically produce neu5ac from n-acetyl-d-glucosamine , a two-enzyme, sequential system of glcnac 2-epimerase  and neu5ac aldolase  is commonly used  <cit> . glcnac 2-epimerase catalyzes the inter-conversion of glcnac to n-acetyl-d-mannosamine , which then reacts with pyruvate to form neu5ac through the enzymatic action of neu5ac aldolase  <cit> . glcnac 2-epimerase has been found in mammals  and in the unicellular cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. strain pcc <dig>  the mammalian glcnac 2-epimerase has been defined as a renin-binding protein, with the ability to bind rennin and mask protease activity, similar to cellular rennin inhibitors  <cit> . in addition to the renin-binding version from porcine kidney, glcnac 2-epimerase has also been obtained through overexpression from synechocystis sp., and is used in practical applications to catalyze glcnac epimerization  <cit> . the second enzyme in neu5ac production, neu5ac aldolase, was previously named n-acetylneuraminate lyase and found to be present in escherichia coli k <dig> and other e. coli strains  <cit> , as well as a wide variety of other sources, including pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . the e. coli gene for neu5ac has been overexpressed for neu5ac production from mannac and pyruvate  <cit>  and for the production of 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-nonopyranulosonic acid  from d-mannose and pyruvate  <cit> .

for large-scale production, enzymes are usually used in immobilized form to allow easy enzyme reuse and product recovery. enzymes are typically immobilized on solid supports through a covalent linkage. based on this technology, neu5ac aldolase has been immobilized on eupergit-c for neu5ac production  <cit>  and has also been retained in membrane reactors using ultrafiltration membranes  <cit> . this paper describes the construction of gene fusions for expressing glcnac 2-epimerase and neu5ac aldolase, both with an n-terminal glutathione s-transferase  tag, and a c-terminal tag of five contiguous aspartate residues  on glcnac 2-epimerase and five contiguous arginine residues  on neu5ac aldolase. the resulting overexpressed, double-tagged proteins, termed gst-glcnac 2-epimerase-5d and gst-neu5ac aldolase-5r, were purified and immobilized for enzymatic reaction. the overexpressed proteins in crude extracts could also be directly used for immobilization via the polyionic tags.

RESULTS
expression of double-tagged glcnac 2-epimerase
a  <dig> bp pcr fragment encoding the synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> glcnac 2-epimerase gene, plus a sequence encoding 5d, was cloned into pgex-2tk between the bamhi and ecori sites. the resulting plasmid contained a in-frame fusion of gst, glcnac 2-epimerase and 5d, and was confirmed by dna sequencing. under the inducing conditions indicated in methods, e. coli bl <dig> harboring the gene fusion produced a significant level of double-tagged glcnac 2-epimerase when grown to an od <dig> of approximately  <dig>  and treated with iptg to induce gene expression. as shown in figure 1a, the expression level was nearly independent of iptg concentration between  <dig>  to  <dig> mm, when induction was for  <dig> h. the fusion protein was largely insoluble . at every iptg concentration, only a low level of fusion protein was seen in the supernatant fractions  of crude protein extracts.

the expression level of fusion protein increased significantly with induction time, as shown in figure 1b–1d. one hour after induction, the protein became evident in the s fraction, increased as induction time reached to  <dig> h, and remained somewhat constant through 5– <dig> h of induction. in contrast, protein in the p fraction dramatically increased after  <dig> h, and increased proportionally with time of induction afterward. the specific glcnac 2-epimerase activity of protein in the s fraction increased slightly after  <dig> h of induction, to about  <dig>  u/mg when measured as the conversion of mannac to glcnac, and remained unchanged thereafter. p fractions containing the overexpressed proteins had relatively higher activities. as shown in figure 1b, the specific activity increased by approximately  <dig>  fold in the p fraction after  <dig> h induction, and after  <dig> h, the specific activity had risen to  <dig>  u/mg, corresponding to approximately  <dig>  times the activity of the soluble fractions. these data suggest that the proteins in the precipitate were active, and formed aggregates because their concentrations were much higher than the protein solubility. p fraction samples were prepared by re-dissolving the precipitate of the crude protein extract with  <dig> ml deionized water. the tremendous increase in specific activity in the p fraction was mainly due to the enrichment of overexpressed double-tagged protein in the precipitated form.

using the compute pi/mw tool in the expasy proteomics server , the theoretical molecular mass for gst-glcnac 2-epimerase-5d was predicted to be  <dig>  kda. the introduction of the gst tag allows the double-tagged fusion protein to be purified from the protein extract using conventional affinity methods. after gsh-affinity purification, the purified gst-glcnac 2-epimerase-5d had a specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg protein using mannac as the substrate. previous studies on glcnac 2-epimerase indicated that this enzyme has a ph optimum of  <dig>  <cit> , with high activity at ph 7– <dig>  but no activity below ph  <dig>  since the theoretical pi for native glcnac 2-epimerase is  <dig> , this means the enzyme is likely to be active only in deprotonized conditions, when ph>pi. the addition of gst to generate gst-glcnac 2-epimerase, including the linker sequences, led to a theoretical increase in pi to  <dig> . we thus designed a 5d tag at the c-terminus to bring the theoretical pi back to  <dig> .

the introduction of tags not only increased the protein solubility, but also altered the thermal stability. a previous study showed that the optimal temperature for glcnac 2-epimerase from synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> is 37°c  <cit> . the double-tagged fusion protein was determined to have an optimal temperature of 50°c, suggesting a higher operation temperature was possible for the application of double-tagged glcnac 2-epimerase to sialic acid production. the michaelis constant, km, for purified gst-glcnac 2-epimerase was determined to be  <dig>  mm using mannac as substrate. this value was slightly higher than the  <dig>  mm determined earlier  <cit>  for native glcnac 2-epimerase from the same source. pyruvate is a competitive inhibitor for this enzyme. the inhibition constant of pyruvate for gst-glcnac 2-epimerase-5d was  <dig> mm, which was very close to the  <dig> mm determined for single-tagged protein gst-glcnac 2-epimerase  <cit> .

expression of double-tagged neu5ac aldolase
sequences  encoding neu5ac aldolase and 5r were amplified from e. coli. the pcr product was purified and cloned into pgem-t easy vector, before excision and insertion into pgex-2tk between the bamhi and ecori sites. this construction created a fusion of neu5ac aldolase tagged with gst at the n-terminus and 5r at the c-terminus, with the gene for the double-tagged protein under the regulation of the tac promoter. the fusion protein contains a total of  <dig> amino acid residues comprising neu5ac aldolase, the two tags, and the sequence linking gst and neu5ac aldolase. non-tagged neu5ac aldolase contains  <dig> amino acid residues and has a computed mw of  <dig>  kda and theoretical pi value of  <dig> , while the computed mw and pi for the fusion protein are  <dig>  kda and  <dig> .

similar to gst-glcnac 2-epimerase-5d, gst-neu5ac aldolase-5r could also be overexpressed in e. coli. sds-page results for gst-neu5ac aldolase-5r  were similar to those for gst-glcnac 2-epimerase-5d. unlike the induction of gst-glcnac 2-epimerase-5d, however, the expression level of gst-neu5ac aldolase-5r depended on inducer concentration. the use of  <dig>  m iptg led to a significantly lower level of protein expression than  <dig>  and  <dig> mm. the fusion protein was largely insoluble . the band showing the level of soluble protein  was indistinct, suggesting a relatively low solubility for gst-neu5ac aldolase-5r.

overexpression of gst-neu5ac aldolase-5r was confirmed by analyzing the purified fusion protein after affinity purification. figure 2b and 2c show the sds-page analysis and western blotting of gst-neu5ac aldolase-5r from gsh-affinity column fractions. western blotting using antibody against the gst tag showed that the molecular mass of double-tagged protein was close to the theoretical value of  <dig>  kda.

in the fused construct in plasmid pgex-2tk, a thrombin recognition site lies between gst and neu5ac aldolase, so the gst tag could be released from the fusion protein by thrombin digestion. cleavage of the double-tagged fusion protein by thrombin resulted in two proteins, gst and neu5ac aldolase-5r. both the double-tagged fusion protein gst-neu5ac aldolase-5r, and the gst-released fusion protein neu5ac aldolase-5r were able to bind sp sepharose. the typical adsorption curve displayed a change in adsorbed fusion protein with time. a sharp decrease of proteins in solution was observed within the first few hours, followed by a very slow decrease during the immobilization process. this was seen using two preparations of the purified fusion proteins. although the theoretical pi values for gst-neu5ac aldolase-5r and neu5ac aldolase-5r with their linker sequences are  <dig>  and  <dig> , the experimental pi values were estimated as  <dig>  and  <dig>  from two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. thus, they could easily be immobilized on the cationic exchanger sp sepharose.

immobilization of fused proteins
for the production of sialic acid, neu5ac, using glcnac 2-epimerase and neu5ac aldolase in a single pot, both enzymes should be active at the operational conditions, including ph and temperature. a ph in the range of 7– <dig>  should be optimal, because in that range, the double-tagged neu5ac aldolase would be positively charged, since its pi value was increased by the introduced 5r tag. this allowed the fusion protein to be easily adsorbed onto cationic sp sepharose resins. in contrast, the double-tagged glcnac 2-epimerase would be negatively charged and able to bind to the anionic exchanger q sepharose. immobilization of the gst affinity-purified fusion proteins onto ion exchange resins was achieved in a few hours. greater concentrations of proteins mixed with the ion exchanger caused a longer adsorption time before adsorption equilibrium was reached. if a ten-hour adsorption was used, the amount of fusion protein in the incubated solution could be increased, leading to more adsorbed protein on the resin . when the applied concentration was  <dig>  mg/ml, about 90% of the purified fusion protein could be immobilized. when the applied concentration was  <dig>  mg/ml, the immobilized protein approached  <dig>  mg protein/g resin, corresponding to immobilization of approximately 30% of the proteins. immobilization led to a reduction in enzymatic activity of about 25%, based on the specific activity of purified protein as 100%.

time courses of immobilization of double-tagged glcnac 2-epimerase on q sepharose were similar to those for immobilization of double-tagged neu5ac aldolase on sp sepharose. a similar pattern  was seen for the influence of the applied concentration of purified gst-glcnac 2-epimerase-5d on the amount of protein bound to q sepharose.

since the lysis of cells overexpressing the tagged protein resulted in a large amount of enzymatically active protein in the precipitate, repeated lysis  was employed to increase the volume of lysis buffer as well as the extent of cell disruption and protein dissolution. all supernatants were pooled and used as the crude protein extract for fusion protein immobilization. by using the ionic tags, direct capture of fusion protein from the crude protein extract was very effective. as shown in figure  <dig>  the amount of protein immobilized on the resins increased with the loaded concentration of protein. for double-tagged neu5ac aldolase binding to sp sepharose, the amount of bound protein approached  <dig>  mg protein/g-resin when the crude extract protein concentration was  <dig>  mg/ml. the bound protein concentration remained at this level even if the applied concentration was higher, suggesting saturation of protein adsorption. like the adsorption of purified double-tagged neu5ac aldolase to the same ion exchange resin, the fraction of crude protein adsorption decreased with increased protein loading concentration. if the loaded concentration of protein was  <dig>  mg/ml, only 30% of proteins in the crude extract were immobilized on the resin. a purification effect was seen for selective immobilization of fusion proteins through their ionic interactions. when a crude,  <dig>  mg/ml double-tagged neu5ac aldolase solution with a specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg was applied to sp sepharose, the protein eluted from the ion exchanger with  <dig> n nacl possessed a specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg.

similar adsorption behavior was observed for the immobilization of gst-glcnac 2-epimerase-5d on q sepharose. when the loading concentration of crude protein was  <dig>  mg/ml, the saturated adsorbed density of protein was  <dig>  mg protein/g resin. under these conditions, about 30% of proteins from the crude extract were immobilized on the resin. since the protein was not purified prior to immobilization, the specific activity of the immobilized fusion protein was lower than that of immobilized, purified fusion protein. based on the activity of immobilized, purified gst-neu5ac aldolase-5r, the specific activity of immobilized gst-neu5ac aldolase-5r via direct capture from crude extract was only 21%. the specific activity of immobilized gst-glcnac 2-epimerase-5d via direct capture from crude extract was 37% of the activity of immobilized, purified gst-glcnac 2-epimerase-5d. however, the specific activity of immobilized protein obtained by direct capture from crude extract was still much higher than that of protein from crude extract, suggesting a purification effect from selective immobilization through the ionic interaction. when a  <dig> . mg/ml crude gst-glcnac 2-epimerase-5d solution with a specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg, using glcnac as the substrate, was applied to q sepharose, protein from the ion exchanger with  <dig> n nacl possessed a specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg.

production of neu5ac using two immobilized double-tagged fusion proteins
both the soluble and immobilized forms of double-tagged 2-epimerase-5d were effective for the epimerization of glcnac and mannac. using glcnac as the substrate, the conversion rate catalyzed by purified gst-glcnac 2-epimerase-5d increased with the dose of fusion protein and the reaction time. the double-tagged neu5ac aldolase immobilized on the cationic exchanger sp sepharose was able to catalyze the formation of kdn from d-mannose and pyruvate  <cit> .

in another neu5ac synthesis reaction, combined doses of  <dig> u/l gst-glcnac 2-epimerase-5d immobilized on q sepharose and  <dig> u/l gst-neu5ac aldolase-5r immobilized on sp sepharose were used as biocatalysts. a conversion of 35% could be achieved in  <dig> h, corresponding to a productivity of  <dig>  g neu5ac l- <dig> h- <dig> at 30°c, on the same initial concentration of substrates.

discussion
tagged fusion proteins are frequently used for the purification of overexpressed proteins. in addition to enhancing purification through the use of tags, or fusion partners, that can bind specifically to affinity resins, the introduction of a tag can also improve the solubility of the target protein and facilitate its detection during expression and purification. the addition of a fusion partner can result in high-level expression of the target protein. in this work, we found that introduced tags could not only provide a site for specific purification and immobilization, but also offered the possibility of adjusting the physical properties, such as pi value, of the target protein. glcnac 2-epimerase showed a narrow ph range of enzymatic activity. the introduction of gst and 5d tags at n- and c-termini maintained the theoretical pi of the double-tagged glcnac 2-epimerase at the same value as the native protein. the fusion form of the enzyme was active at reaction conditions of ph 7– <dig>  that deprotonized the enzyme protein. the introduced gst and 5r tags increased the theoretical pi of native neu5ac aldolase from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the two enzymes, overexpressed as double-tagged fusion proteins, could easily be isolated from cell extracts, and possessed enzymatic activity at operational conditions.

the introduction of tags did not alter significantly the kinetic properties of glcnac 2-epimerase and neu5ac aldolase. for glcnac 2-epimerase, the gst and 5d tags increased the michaelis constant from  <dig>  mm for the native protein to  <dig>  mm for fusion protein, when mannac was used as the substrate. also, the introduced tags did not change the inhibition constant of pyruvate for glcnac 2-epimerase. similarly, the introduction of gst and 5r tags only marginally altered the kinetic properties of neu5ac aldolase. the michaelis constant of purified gst-neu5ac aldolase-5r was  <dig>  mm using neu5ac as the substrate, which was slightly higher than the  <dig> – <dig>  mm reported in the literature  <cit>  for native e. coli neu5ac aldolase. when only the gst tag was introduced into neu5ac aldolase, the km value for the single-tagged protein was  <dig>  mm against neu5ac  <cit> . the second, highly charged 5r tag only slightly altered the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate. these findings suggest that the active sites of fused proteins were not hindered by tags at both the n- and c-termini. the strategy proposed in this work could not be generalized and adapted for other enzymatic systems in which the enzyme proteins do not have well-exposed n- and c-termini, or the introduction of tags severely changes the conformation and activity of the protein.

both fusion proteins were overexpressed via pgex-2tk, with the fusion protein genes under control of the tac promoter. induction time had a greater influence on fusion protein expression level than iptg concentration. a low concentration of  <dig>  mm inducer seemed sufficient for the induction of gst-glcnac 2-epimerase-5d overexpression. for overexpression of gst-neu5ac aldolase-5r, however, the inducer concentration influenced the expression level and fusion protein was expressed at a very low level when no inducer was present. this leak expression is not uncommon in the pgex expression system. the overexpressed proteins in the precipitate had a relatively high activity, suggesting that most overexpressed proteins were active but formed aggregates, with the concentration of proteins exceeding their solubility.

although the gst tag of  <dig> aa, with a theoretical pi of  <dig>  and mw of  <dig>  da, has been widely used for protein purification and immobilization, we used it here for pi adjustment and increasing protein solubility. direct capture of fusion proteins from crude protein extracts could easily be achieved using the ionic tags. the immobilized preparation from direct binding of overexpressed fusion protein was thus useful for practical applications since it possessed high enzymatic activity and allowed the purification step to be eliminated. the adsorption behaviors for both fusion proteins were very similar. for double-tagged neu5ac aldolase on sp sepharose, the amount of bound protein approached  <dig>  mg protein/g resin, while the maximum binding capacity of gst-glcnac 2-epimerase-5d on q sepharose was  <dig>  mg protein/g-resin. for both double-tagged proteins, a purification effect after selective immobilization through ionic interaction with the ion exchange resins was observed.

in this work, two double-tagged proteins were immobilized onto ion exchangers for practical application in neu5ac production. the production of neu5ac from glcnac involves two sequential enzymes, and both could be used in the immobilized state. in a preliminary run, a 68% conversion could be achieved in  <dig> h using immobilized, double-tagged glcnac 2-epimerase and neu5ac aldolase, both prepared by direct capturing from crude protein extracts. in this particular enzyme reaction system, many parameters can be adjusted, so the optimal strategy for neu5ac production will be subjected to study using mathematical modelling and validated with experimental data  <cit> . adjustable parameters include the doses and ratio of the two enzymes, the initial concentration ratio of pyruvate to glcnac, the timing of pyruvate addition and temperature programming, among others.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, for one-pot enzymatic production of sialic acid, we overexpressed two sequential enzymes as double-tagged fusion proteins that were easily immobilized onto ionic exchange resins by direct capture from crude protein extracts. the gene fusions were constructed so that enzyme activities were not altered, and expressed fusion proteins were charged at reaction ph. experimental results showed that both double-tagged fusions, glcnac 2-epimerase and neu5ac aldolase, functioned well, and sialic acid could be produced using the two proteins immobilized on anoinic or cationic exchange resins.
