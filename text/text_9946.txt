BACKGROUND
the unique properties of wheat flour primarily depend on seed storage proteins, which mainly consist of gluten  <cit> . gluten is glutamine and proline-rich proteins, having a storage function of nitrogen and sulphur. gluten is traditionally classified into low molecular weight  glutenins, high molecular weight  glutenins and the large gliadin group  <cit> . gliadins are mainly monomeric proteins of 30– <dig> kd with poor solubility in dilute salt solutions, and good solubility in 70% ethanol  <cit> . the gliadins are composed of α-, γ- and ω-types  <cit> . hmw-glutenin genes locate at the long arms of group  <dig> chromosomes   <cit> . the α-gliadins are encoded by the gli- <dig> loci on the short arms of group  <dig> chromosomes. the γ-gliadins and ω-gliadins are encoded by the gli- <dig> loci on the short arms of homeologous chromosome  <dig>  and are tightly linked to the glu- <dig> loci coding for lmw-glutenins  <cit> .

gluten is the most important source of protein for human being, and a wide diversity of food has been developed to take advantage of the properties  of wheat flour. it is reported that visco-elastic properties of wheat are affected by the proportions of gluten polymers, and that allelic variation in the composition of the hmw-glutenins is strongly correlated with differences in the breadmaking quality  <cit> . although gliadins comprise of 40–50% of total endosperm storage proteins in wheat, their roles in determining the properties of wheat flour are not well understood yet. the complex family structure of gliadins, compared to hmw-glutenin, complicates the determination of their function. the estimated copy number for γ-gliadin genes is between  <dig> and  <dig> in triticum aestivum cv 'chinese spring'  <cit> . classification based on their primary structure would facilitate further functional studies. γ-gliadin genes have previously been divided into three hybridization classes  <cit> . pistón et al.  <cit>  classified γ-gliadin genes into four groups based on the phylogenic analysis.

celiac disease , a widely prevalent autoimmune disease of the small intestine , is induced in susceptible individuals by exposure to dietary gluten  <cit> . however, given the enormous biological diversity and unique chemistry of gluten, and the absence of satisfactory assays for gluten toxicity, the structural basis for gluten toxicity in cd remains unclear  <cit> . it has been shown that some native gluten sequences can bind to hla-dq2/ <dig> and induce t cell responses. in addition, modification of gluten peptides by the enzyme transglutaminase results in high affinity hla-dq2/ <dig> binding peptides that can induce t cell responses  <cit> . the principal toxic components of wheat gluten are gliadins. γ-gliadins contain several sets of celiac disease epitopes  <cit> .

the γ-gliadins have been considered to be the most ancient members of the wheat gluten family  <cit> . sequence information for γ-gliadin genes in genbank includes  <dig> complete/nearly complete open reading frame  and  <dig> partial sequences. these sequences come from various wheat and aegilops species. however, no systematic research has been conducted yet.

we have performed an extensive and comparative analysis of γ-gliadin genes from common wheat and its closely related species in order to classify the γ-gliadin genes, and to investigate the diversity of the cd epitopes and nutritional quality of each γ-gliadin group. this study clarifies our understanding of the evolution of the multigene family.

RESULTS
a total of  <dig> γ-gliadin genes were isolated from common wheat and its closely related species . there is no indication of introns interrupting the coding region . thirty-two of these sequences are pseudogenes, all of which contain one or more internal stop codons or frameshift mutations caused by single nucleotide indels . the remaining  <dig> sequences are putatively functional, with no internal stop codons.

species
t. aestivum originated from the hybridization between t. turgidum and ae. tauschii, followed by genome duplication. t. turgidum evolved from t. dicoccoides that was formed in the intercrossing between t. urartu and ae. speltoides . t. monococcum was one representative of the a genome as well. the other four species of sitopsis were used as relatives to ae. speltoides; shw = synthetic hexaploid wheat; aegilopoides = t. monococcum ssp. aegilopoides; monococcum = t. monococcum ssp. monococcum.

sequence polymorphism
orf lengths of these sequences range from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. it is notable that fj <dig> amplified from ae. sharonesis is the shortest γ-gliadin gene so far reported , whose repetitive region has  <dig> amino acid residues. fj <dig> and fj <dig> isolated from ae. speltoides are the longest , containing  <dig> amino acid in their repetitive regions.

orf lengths of the sequences derived from ae. sharonesis are the most variable , while the sequences from t. monococcum ssp.aegilopoides are the most conserved in length. lengths of the repetitive region  of these sequences vary greatly as well  . the lengths of orf and the repetitive region were analyzed for difference on average. it is shown that they have a similar changing trend. considering the sequence alignment result, it could be concluded that the repetitive region is mainly responsible for the size heterogeneity of the γ-gliadins.

orf refers to the sequences from initial codon to mature stop codon; average <dig> = the average length of orf; sd <dig> = standard deviation of orf length; average <dig> = the average length of domain ii; sd <dig> = standard deviation of the length of domain ii; shw = synthetic hexaploid wheat; aegilopoides = t. monococcum ssp. aegilopoides; monococcum = t. monococcum ssp. monococcum.

shw = synthetic hexaploid wheat; aegilopoides = t. monococcum ssp. aegilopoides; monococcum = t. monococcum ssp. monococcum; no. = the number of sequences; s = segregating sites; mut = total number of mutations; sd = standard deviation; h = haplotypes; hd = haplotype diversity; *indicates p <  <dig> ; **indicates p <  <dig> ; *** indicates p <  <dig> .

linkage disequilibrium  and recombination
ld between γ-gliadin sequences in different genomes could be estimated by zns, which has a range from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the values of zns are in a wide range . the highest is  <dig>  in t. monococcum ssp. aegilopoides, and the lowest is  <dig>  in t. aestivum. however, there is a high level of ld in γ-gliadin family. a measure of the minimum number of recombination events for these data yields a range of 0– <dig> 

repetitive region
the repetitive domain is long  and consists of regular short repeats . multiple sequence alignment indicates that the two end of this domain are conserved, and the changes mainly caused by snp . the internal part is highly variable, mainly resulting from repeat insertions/deletions. these repeat domains have been evolving rapidly, and should not be used as a basis for determining relatedness  <cit> . to investigate whether the repetitive regions are related to the genomic origin of γ-gliadin genes, the nucleotide sequences of this domain were used to carry out the phylogenic analysis. the great majority of the sequences from diploid wheat and aegilops species show a clustering according to their genomic origins . therefore, it would be much better if the repetitive domains were used in the relatedness analysis.

the phylogenic analysis facilitates us to array peptide repeat pattern in parallel. the reported typical unit of γ-gliadins is pfpq1–21– <dig>  <cit> . our consensus repeat motif is similar to it, and modified by the substitution of several residues, i.e. pfpq1–2qq)1– <dig>  the initial and final repeat motifs do not fit the consensus motif but are included since they appear to be related to the consensus  <cit> . the unit is repeated from  <dig> to  <dig> times and interspersed by additional residue.

relatedness of γ-gliadin genes
firstly, the γ-gliadin genes cloned from t. urartu, ae. speltoides and ae. tauschii were used to carry out the phylogenic analysis . it contains three subtrees and shows a clear clustering of these γ-gliadin genes according to their genomic origins. exceptions are some genes from ae. speltoides and ae. tauschii. secondly, to gain a further insight into the relationship between γ-gliadin genes from different genomes, we included the γ-gliadin sequences from the two subspecies of t. monococcum and other four sitopsis species i.e. ae. sharonesis, ae. bicornis, ae. longissima and ae. searsii  into the phylogenic analysis. they cover all the diploid species that represent the ancestral genomes of t. aestivum. inclusion of these sequences does not alter the fundamental structure of the phylogenic tree, and continues to strongly support the division of the three subtrees. for a clear arrangement, we have chosen all the γ-gliadin genes from ae. speltoides and ae. tauschii, and randomly selected three sequences from each of the other diploid species to create a phylogenic tree . the presence of strongly supported mixed subtrees indicates that there is no obvious discrimination between gli-d <dig> and gli-s <dig> loci, compared with gli-a <dig>  furthermore, the sequences from the five sitopsis species could not be clearly distinguished in the two subtrees.

to assess the phylogenic relationship among the γ-gliadin genes from tetraploid wheat, we aligned the sequences of diploid and tetraploid species, and constructed dendrograms. the γ-gliadin sequences that clustered together with the sequences from diploid wheat  should be closely related to the a genome . the sequences that fall in cluster ii are supposed to locate at the gli-b <dig> locus of tetraploid wheat. it is interesting that the eleven γ-gliadin sequences of t. dicoccoides exactly clustered together with those of ae. tauschii in a small cluster , which confirms the close relationship between the gli-s <dig>  and gli-d <dig> loci. using the characteristics of clusters described above, we could only identify the sequences relating to the a genome  among those cloned from hexaploid wheat.

cysteine and classification
the deduced amino acid peptides of the  <dig> putatively functional γ-gliadin genes  were analyzed for differences in the number and placement of cysteine residues  <cit> . most of the peptides  contain eight cysteine residues that form four intramolecular disulphide bonds  <cit> . the eight cysteine residues are located following a conserved pattern   <cit> , where the fourth and fifth cysteines are consecutive in the polypeptide chain. fifty-three γ-gliadins show modified patterns of cysteine distribution either by adding/deleting cysteine residues or changing their relative locations , among which  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> peptides contain  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cysteine residues, respectively. differences in the number of cysteine among γ-gliadins are likely to result from point mutations, which involve cgc-tgc, tcc-tgc, tac-tgc, ttc-tgc, ggt-tgt and tcg-tgc. besides the number of cysteine, the main difference among the nine patterns resides in the presence of the first cysteine residue either in the non-repetitive region or nearer along in the repetitive domain. it is notable that aj <dig> has an additional cysteine in the glutamine-rich region.

the a indicate the representatives of the nine patterns used in figure 3; 't' and 'l' indicate the sequences that contain a higher proportion of total essential amino acids and lys, respectively. some sequences are marked more than once. for example, aj937838t, l means aj <dig> has been used in figure  <dig>  and the proportions of its total essential amino acids and lys are higher.

using the number of cysteine residues as a discrimination factor, we classified the  <dig> putatively functional γ-gliadin genes into four groups, i.e. c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> . forty-five sequences of c <dig> share a high identity . a comparison of the relative position of cysteine residues within each group allows to define respectively four, one, three and one cysteine distribution patterns within c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> . those patterns with fewer than five members are directly recognized as subgroups . phylogenic analyses of the deduced mature proteins of the members of pattern c9-p <dig> and c8-p <dig> indicate that c9-p <dig> and c8-p <dig> should be grouped into four and six subgroups, respectively . accordingly, we have totally defined  <dig> γ-gliadin subgroups. the frequencies of the  <dig> subgroups among the wheat and aegilops accessions  are shown in additional file  <dig>  the γ-gliadins of each accession prefer to fall into one or two subgroups.

amino acid composition
the proportion of each amino acid differs significantly in γ-gliadins. γ-gliadins are rich in gln  and pro , followed by leu , and show a 20:10: <dig> ratio of q:p:f for total amino acids. essential amino acids are indispensable for good health, but cannot be synthesized in the body and must be supplied in the diet. there are eight  out of the  <dig> naturally occurring amino acids considered essential for humans. one of the problems with wheat flour is that they do not provide enough essential amino acids, which is mainly caused by the lack of essential amino acids in seed storage proteins. we analyzed the proportions of the eight essential amino acids in each of the deduced mature γ-gliadin peptides. a wide range of the proportion of each essential amino acid has been observed. the limiting amino acid  in wheat is lys. its average proportion is  <dig> %, with a range of  <dig> – <dig> %. the values are a little higher than those of trp . the average proportions of met, thr, phe, val, ile and leu are  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, which range from  <dig> – <dig> %,  <dig> – <dig> %,  <dig> – <dig> %,  <dig> – <dig> %,  <dig> – <dig> % and  <dig> – <dig> %, respectively.

the repetitive domain is long and variable, consisting mostly of gln , pro  and phe . this domain has a different q:p:f ratio . to provide more information for wheat breeding, we analyzed the essential amino acid proportions of mature γ-gliadin peptides while ignoring the repetitive domain . the average proportions of six out of the eight essential amino acids significantly increase up . exceptions are thr and phe. eighteen γ-gliadin sequences  whose repetitive domains contain fewer than  <dig> amino acid residues  were selected for additional comparison against the whole group. compared with the other two sets of values , theirs are intermediate.

number = the number of amino acid residues in the repetitive domains.

compared to the essential amino acid proportions of the sequences with a long repetitive domain, the most γ-gliadins with fewer than  <dig> residues in the repetitive domain contain a higher proportion of total essential amino acids and lys . however, it is noticeable that the corresponding proportions of some γ-gliadins with a long repetitive domain are high as well. we determined the corresponding subgroups of each γ-gliadin . analysis indicated that these γ-gliadins tend to be the members of certain groups, such as sg- <dig> and sg- <dig> .

analysis of cd toxic epitopes in γ-gliadins
the perfect matches in the  <dig> putatively functional genes to the three cd-toxic epitopes of γ-gliadins  <cit>  are shown in table  <dig>  each epitope appears at most once in every sequence, and all of them located at the repetitive domain. the result indicates that those subgroups or species contribute differently to the epitope content. firstly, more γ-gliadins from t. aestivum, ae. longissima and ae. bicornis contain cd toxic peptides. secondly,  <dig> sequences altogether contain these epitopes. the epitopes are present in seven subgroups ; sg- <dig> ; sg- <dig> ; sg- <dig> ; sg- <dig> ; sg- <dig>  sg- <dig> ). however, a majority of them  are members of c <dig>  five out of seven members of c <dig> contain the toxic peptides. only two out of the  <dig> sequences of c <dig> contain the toxic epitopes. one  of the  <dig> γ-gliadins with fewer than  <dig> residues in the repetitive domain contain a toxic epitope. finally, occurrences of the three epitopes are at the frequencies of 18/ <dig>  19/ <dig> and 11/ <dig>  respectively.

t. spelta = t. aestivum ssp. spelta; t. turgidum= t. turgidum ssp. turgidum

a further look at the sequences reveals that amino acid change in particular epitopes caused by snp disrupt the continuous peptides. forty-one analogues of epitopes are shown in additional file  <dig>  substitutions of amino acid often concern glutamine and proline residue. amino acid insertions and deletions also occur frequently, which destroy the epitopes .

discussion
diversity of γ-gliadin sequences
sequence diversity between the γ-gliadin genes is due to snps and variations in the repetitive region, and the latter is mainly responsible for the size heterogeneity of the γ-gliadins  <cit> . it is comparatively confirmed by our result. nucleotide diversity  was estimated to be lower in self-pollinated diploid wheat than open-pollinated aegilops species . besides the large number of segregating sites and mutations, haplotype diversity of γ-gliadin genes is high in every species investigated, which indicates a high nucleotide diversity of γ-gliadin family. extensive linkage disequilibrium found with different species indicates similar ancestries between freely recombining portions of gli- <dig> loci. negative values of the neutrality test statistics  in most species suggest that they are mainly under negative selection. overall, gli- <dig> loci in different species are diverse, although γ-gliadin is supposed to be the most ancient family among prolamins  <cit> .

evolution of γ-gliadin multigene family
to avoid pcr bias, two forward and two reverse primers are used to amplify the full orf of γ-gliadin genes. as a result, we isolated  <dig> unique γ-gliadin genes from t. aestivum cv 'chinese spring'. meanwhile, nine to  <dig> unique genes were cloned from the nine diploid wheat and aegilops species, respectively, with an average of  <dig> . there are  <dig> to  <dig> copies of γ-gliadin genes in chinese spring  <cit> . considering the copy number, it can be concluded that the γ-gliadin sequences we cloned could represent the whole γ-gliadin family. multiplication of γ-gliadin genes should have occurred in the diploid level, since a large number of γ-gliadin genes have been isolated from a few accessions, which is similar to the result on α-gliadin genes  <cit> .

the number of γ-gliadin sequences cloned from two accessions of t. dicoccoides and as <dig> of t. turgidum are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. it seems likely that tetraploid wheat went through a bottleneck in gli- <dig> loci, which is supported by the small copy numbers compared with those of common wheat and diploid species. we could conclude that great changes happened to the gli- <dig> regions in the formation of tetraploid wheat. it is possible that some γ-gliadin sequences disappeared from the genome. it is interesting to note that similar event seems not occur during the formation of t. aestivum. experimental data, based on the simulation of the evolutionary step by synthetic hexaploid wheat  and its parental lines , supports the assumption of γ-gliadin sequences disappearance. therefore, duplication and subsequent divergence might be important as well at the polyploid level in contrast to the diploid strains.

pseudogenes are involved in phylogenic analysis, and they fall into correct clusters, which indicate that the occurrence of pseudogenes should have take place after the divergence of diploid species.

classification
it is the primary structure of peptides that finally determines very specific properties of the ending biomaterials  <cit> . the structures are important to dough rheology and other aspects of food technology  <cit> . according to the characteristics of primary structure, i.e. number and placement of cysteine residues and the phylogenic result, we divided γ-gliadins into  <dig> subgroups based on the mature peptides  . the different subfamilies are very distinct from each other. the classification of γ-gliadins has essential importance with regard to dough quality, since cysteine residues play a critical role in unique properties of wheat flour. typical γ-gliadins contain eight cysteine residues. we have also found γ-gliadins containing seven, nine and even ten cysteine residues. furthermore, we identified nine cysteine distribution patterns. changes in position and number of cysteine residues might affect the pattern of disulphide bond formation, resulting in failure of forming some intramolecular disulphide bond. these cysteine residues would then be available for intermolecular disulphide bond formation and polymer-building  <cit> . however, we have not known whether these gliadins are chain terminator  or chain extenders , which would presumably have a negative effect on flour quality or allow the formation of stronger dough, respectively  <cit> .

alternatively, we classified γ-gliadins into two types: i.e. repetitive domain< <dig> amino acids and repetitive domain ≥  <dig> amino acids, which are named as sequences with a short repetitive domain  and sequences with a long repetitive domain  respectively. the repetitive domain is rich in glutamine and proline, which is the major sequence variation that discriminates the different γ-gliadins.

nutritional quality
it is well known that nutritional quality of food that lack essential amino acids is low, as the body tends to convert the amino acids obtained into fats and carbohydrates. therefore, a balance of essential amino acids is necessary for a high degree of net protein utilization . the net protein utilization is profoundly affected by the limiting amino acid proportion . the limiting amino acid of wheat is lysine, which mainly caused by a low level of lysine in gliadin  <cit> , since gliadins account for about half of the total storage proteins  <cit> . we systematically analyzed the proportions of eight essential amino acids of γ-gliadins, which indicates that subgroup sg- <dig> and sg- <dig> and the γ-gliadins with a short repetitive domain contain higher proportions of lysine and total essential amino acids. a wide range of the proportion of each essential amino acid could be seen, which provides the possibility of breeding more nutritional wheat varieties.

perspective for wheat breeding programs
the only efficient therapy for cd is a life-long gluten-free diet. conceivably, a diet based on gluten from a wheat species that expresses no or few t-cell stimulatory gluten peptides should be equally well tolerated by the celiac patients and, importantly, also be beneficial for disease prevention  <cit> . it is also indicated that the genetic differences in gliadins might allow designing strategies for selection and breeding of less toxic wheat varieties . our results indicate that  <dig> out of the  <dig> putatively functional sequences contain γ-gliadin epitopes, and that γ-gliadins with a short repetitive domain almost contain no toxic epitopes, with the exception of fj <dig>  meanwhile,  <dig> sequences out of those with a long repetitive domain contain γ-gliadin epitopes. obviously, the classification depending on the length of repetitive domain is reflected in the occurrence of toxic epitopes. cd-toxic peptides of γ-gliadins are only found in the repetitive domain, especially the internal part, which is highly variable in length. those γ-gliadins with a short repetitive domain contain a brief internal part, which means that they are not/nearly not toxic to the population with celiac disease. the two subgroups sg- <dig> and sg- <dig>  which show a relatively good nutritional quality, present four  and five  members containing epitopes. therefore, it is suggested that the genes with a short repetitive domain are more nutritional and valuable. it is reported that stimulatory epitopes in α-gliadins from the d genome is the highest, compared to those from the a and b genome  <cit> . however, we have not found any epitope in the γ-gliadins from ae. tauschii .

CONCLUSIONS
we systematically characterized the γ-gliadin multigene family in common wheat and its closely related tetraploid and diploid species. it is shown that γ-gliadin family is highly diverse. phylogenic analyses indicate a more close relationship between the gli- <dig> loci of the b and d genomes. according to the differences in primary structure, we have classified γ-gliadins into  <dig> subgroups, which might reflect their differences in the contributions to the processing qualities of wheat flour. the γ-gliadins with a short repetitive domain are relatively more nutritional, since they contain a higher proportion of essential amino acids. moreover, these short γ-gliadins almost contain no toxic epitopes. therefore, it is possible to breed wheat varieties, the γ-gliadins of which are less, even non-toxic and more nutritional.
