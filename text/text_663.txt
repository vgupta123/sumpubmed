BACKGROUND
accurate mrna profiling of single cells can provide a powerful means of broadening our understanding of fundamental biological processes such as cancer and development. a number of recent studies have shown that transcriptional profiling of single cells is possible  <cit> , with three amplification strategies often used: in vitro transcription, pcr-based amplification and rolling circle amplification . these approaches have been shown to sensitively reflect the biological status of the target cells  <cit>  with for example, analysis of single cells from mouse blastomeres identifying expression of many more genes than previous studies based on hundreds of blastomeres  <cit> . to take full advantage of recent dramatic technological advances in molecular methods it is essential that these single cell profiling approaches are truly representative of the initial cell amplified, and are also compatible with a broad range of downstream analytical readouts. however, the reproducibility and cross-platform performance of the material generated from these approaches has not generally been confirmed, often because of the limited amounts of material generated. early single cell studies utilized cdna microarrays  <cit>  which enable quantification of tens of thousands of known genes  <cit> . however, this technology has limitations including a restricted fold-range of detection and potential cross-hybridisation between similar sequences  <cit> , as well as being restricted to the probe sets present on the array. the utilization of next generation sequencing  approaches has the capability of identifying all expressed sequences, achieving massive dynamic ranges, having resolution down to the single nucleotide level , and has been adapted for single cell transcription studies . a third platform that has been used to analyse transcriptional signatures of single cells is high-density qpcr, which provides a more restricted but targeted approach with a wide dynamic range and can be readily transferred to a clinical setting  <cit> . each of these approaches has strengths and weaknesses, but the potential to address different questions with regards to single cell analysis.

the ability to transcriptionally profile single cells is of particular value for studying rare, but clinically important cells such as circulating tumour cells , which can be present at levels as low as ≥ <dig> cell per milliliter of peripheral blood  and cancer initiating cells , which can comprise less than 1% of the total tumour  <cit> . single cell rna profiling of ctcs and cics has the potential to provide a means to dissect tumor heterogeneity and identify pathways and genes associated with “stemness” and properties linked to metastasis development and treatment resistance .

to enable us to accurately and sensitively profile these rare cells we initially compared three commercially available rna-amplification protocols to determine the most sensitive and reproducible approach when amplifying single cell equivalent amounts of rna . these experiments showed the epistem rna-amp™ kit to be the most robust. we then further tested this protocol by comparing data generated from mcf <dig> and mcf10a single cell amplified products on affymetrix arrays, high density qpcr and ngs  to unamplified controls to evaluate its utility across a range of relevant technology platforms. reproducible transcriptional profiling was seen across all platforms. having demonstrated the accuracy and reproducibility of the approach we further demonstrated its potential clinical utility through the analysis of highly enriched cics, sorted from a nsclc patient-derived xenograft , according to different surface markers to dissect heterogeneity within the cic pool . rna-seq analysis of nsclc-pdx cics at the level of  <dig> cell input revealed clear cic specific expression patterns with a strong link to previously documented stem cell and epithelial to mesenchymal transition  profiles  <cit> , confirming the clinical usefulness of the methodology.

RESULTS
comparison of three rna-amplification protocols at the single cell level
as the aim of our study was to identify a flexible, sensitive and reproducible protocol that could be used to transcriptionally profile at the single cell level initial experiments aimed to directly compare cdna generated using three kits that were commercially available and had been described for use at the single cell level . to this end, single cell equivalent amounts  of pooled rna isolated from the human epithelial cell lines mcf <dig> were amplified in duplicate and 5 μg of cdna from each sample run on an affymetrix array. bioinformatic analysis of miltenyi superamp™ material identified  <dig> expressed genes present in the duplicate samples with a correlation of  <dig>  between the samples , nugen ovation® one-direct identified  <dig> expressed genes with a correlation of  <dig>   and epistem rna-amp™ identified  <dig> expressed genes with a correlation of  <dig>  . comparison of the genes identified by each protocol showed  <dig> %  of the expressed genes seen in the miltenyi superamp™ samples and  <dig> %  found in the nugen ovation® one-direct samples were also identified in the epistem rna-amp™ samples, with a total of  <dig> %  of all genes identified by either superamp™ and/or ovation® one-direct being picked up in the rna-amp™ material . since these data indicated the epistem rna-amp™ system gave the most sensitive and reproducible results it was chosen for further evaluation.figure  <dig>

generation of high yields of reproducible cdna from single cells
to further determine the sensitivity of the rna-amp™ kit we tested the protocol on single cells from two human epithelial cell lines mcf <dig> and mcf10a . all samples were subjected to rna-amp™ and the resulting cdna analysed by real-time pcr for the expression of  <dig> house keeper genes . this showed consistent amplification of all amplicons, down to single cell input for all replicates, indicating reliable cdna products were obtained that were suitable for further analysis.figure  <dig>

generation of single cell affymetrix array data
rna-amp™ resulted in average yields of  <dig>  μg of cdna from single cell inputs . the large amount of material generated enabled the use of affymetrix arrays to determine the reproducibility of the rna-amp™ method. bioinformatic analysis of affymetrix expression data from  <dig> single mcf <dig> and  <dig> single mcf10a cells identified  <dig> genes differentially expressed between the two cell lines ,  <dig> showing higher expression in mcf <dig> and  <dig> showing higher expression in mcf10a , with pca analysis of the entire data set clearly separating all samples according to cell line , highlighting good reproducibility across all  <dig> single cell inputs from each cell line.

comparison of single cell results to reference data
having demonstrated the practical utility of rna-amp™ using single cell inputs we next set out to further determine its characteristics by comparing the transcriptional profiles generated from rna-amp™ single cell samples to rna-amp™ cdna from purified rna equivalent to approximately  <dig> cells equivalent and unamplified reference rna. for the unamplified reference samples we utilised a previously published data set generated from affymetrix arrays of 10 μg of unamplified rna from each cell line  <cit> . for the  <dig> cell equivalent input we performed rna-amp™ on 1 ng of purified rna from each cell line , which was then analysed on affymetrix arrays as described above.

from these affymetrix array data sets we first selected all of the significantly differentially expressed genes identified in the 10 μg reference data  and aligned these with the corresponding affymetrix array data for the single cell and 1 ng amplified mcf <dig> and mcf10a samples and performed pca analysis. this analysis showed strong grouping of the two cell lines irrespective of input material . we next identified the  <dig> highest differentially expressed genes  in the reference data set  and compared the expression profiles of these transcripts to our single cell and 1 ng data sets . hierarchical clustering based on the top  <dig> differentially expressed genes from the 10 μg reference data again showed clear separation of the two cell lines for all template inputs, with strong correlation seen between the 10 μg reference differentially expressed data and the 1 ng data , and between the 10 μg reference and the single cell data .figure  <dig>

generation of rna-seq data from single cells
to determine the suitability of rna-amp™ material for ngs, and to compare ngs data to microarray data from the same samples we subjected cdna from the  <dig> mcf <dig> single cells and  <dig> mcf10a single cells used for affymetrix array analysis to solid rna-seq ngs. all samples produced high quality ngs data with an average coverage of  <dig> ×  <dig> uniquely mapped reads per sample . bioinformatic analysis of the data identified  <dig> genes showing elevated expression in mcf <dig> single cells and  <dig> showing elevated expression in mcf10a single cells .

to assess cross-platform performance of the amplified material we then compared the expression data generated from the single cell rna-amp™ cdna samples from both the rna-seq and the affymetrix array data . this analysis identified  <dig> genes showing significant differential expression in both data sets . comparison of these  <dig> genes showed consistent patterns of differential expression across both platforms, with an overall pearson correlation between the rna-seq and array data of  <dig>  . from this analysis more differentially expressed genes were identified from the rna-seq data set than the affymetrix array data, with the majority of genes identified in the array data set also identified in the rna-seq data .

to determine whether the additional differentially expressed genes identified by rna-seq were true transcriptional differences and not technical error, we compared the rna-seq data from the single cells to the 10 μg reference microarray data set. all significant differentially expressed genes were identified in both data sets using limma  and edger  with a fc >  <dig> and a fdr <  <dig> . a combined total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes were identified, with an overall pearson correlation for differential expression  between the data sets of  <dig> . to directly compare patterns of expression we identified the  <dig> most differentially expressed genes in the single cell rna-seq data, and then compared their expression in the 10 μg reference data. we then performed the complementary analysis by identifying the  <dig> most differentially expressed genes in the 10 μg reference data and compared their expression in the in the single cell rna-seq data . a highly significant correlation  was identified between all  <dig> genes, with similar expression patterns seen in the single cell rna-seq and the 10 μg reference data .figure  <dig>

high density qpcr of single cell rna-amp™ samples
having shown that rna-amp™ material was amenable to both array and ngs approaches, and produced sensitive, reproducible and accurate results, we finally wanted to investigate its utility for focussed high density qpcr approaches. to this end, we identified a panel of  <dig> qpcr amplicons  based on the single cell microarray data set and examined expression using the wafergen smartchip high density qpcr platform. in addition to the single cell rna-amp™ samples we also included three unamplified 2 μg reference samples and three 1 ng rna-amp™ samples.

limma analysis of the wafergen qpcr data identified  <dig> genes upregulated in the mcf <dig> population, and  <dig> upregulated in the mcf10a population . when we looked at the overlap between the different template types we found that  <dig>  of the mcf7 > mcf10a genes were determined to be significantly upregulated for all sample types and  <dig>  of the mcf10a > mcf <dig> gene set were also seen to be significantly changed in all sample types . hierarchical clustering of the combined data set clearly separated the two cell lines for all template inputs, including single cells and reference rna samples .figure  <dig>

profiling of highly enriched lung cancer stem cells
having established the sensitivity and accuracy of the rna-amplification approach on cell lines, we sought to test its utility with clinically relevant samples. for this we set out to identify genes associated with biologically distinct cell subpopulations obtained from patient-derived non-small cell lung cancer  xenografts . we have recently demonstrated that within cd133+ cics from nsclc-pdxs, we can define a fraction of cd133+/epcam+ cells that represent the resident cancer initiating cells or rcic subpopulation  <cit> , as well as a population of metastatic-associated cancer initiating cells  with surface markers cd133+/cxcr4+/epcam- which show increased potential for metastasis formation . to increase our understanding of the molecular make-up of these populations we dissociated a nsclc-pdx tumour and subjected it to flow cytometric fractionation to obtain unfractionated total tumour , as well as rcic and mcic enriched fractions . all cell samples were sorted directly into complete lysis solution  and stored at −80°c. following thawing, lysate volumes equivalent to  <dig> cells were subjected to rna-amp™ and rna-seq analysis of the resulting cdna was carried out. from the rna-seq data pca analysis and hierarchical clustering  of the protein coding genes showed clear separation of all samples, with  <dig>  genes identified which showed statistically significant differences in expression  between the tt, rcic and mcic samples . from figure 6b it can be seen that there are clear differences between each group and that the most conspicuous differences are seen between the total tumour and the mcic samples.figure  <dig>

to determine the biological relevance of these differentially expressed gene sets we next asked whether genes showing increased  or reduced  expression in the mcic population, compared to the tt samples, are enriched for specific pathways, or overlap with published rna profiles by submitting the top  <dig> differentially expressed genes for david  <cit>  and genesigdb  <cit>  analysis. david pathway analysis showed that mcic up genes were linked to cytoskeleton, ribosomal processing, glutathione transferase and, to a lesser extent, rna splicing and tubulin . this data includes two genes of interest, gstp <dig> and brca <dig>  that were highly expressed in mcic cells  compared to the tt cells . from the genesigdb analysis both mcic up and mcic down genes showed highly significant matches to stem cell and emt profiles . the emt signatures included a signature seen in cd44/cd <dig> enriched breast cancer stem cells  <cit>  and an emt core signature produced by overexpression of twist, snail, gsc and tgf-β <dig>  <cit> . the overlap between the differentially expressed genes identified in the rna-seq data set and other published studies is shown in figure 6c. this figure summarises genes showing a statistical change in the mcic samples which also correspond to published emt signature genes  <cit> .

discussion
single cell whole transcriptome profiling approaches have been in place for over two decades  <cit>  and have led to the identification of novel genes and greater insight into cellular processes . more recently, single cell transcriptome and genomic approaches have been combined  <cit>  and single cell rna-seq approaches have been developed . despite the demonstrable success of single cell analysis the technical requirements needed for representative amplification of single cells and the downstream analysis remain a considerable barrier for widespread implementation in the research community. here we have compared three commercially available rna-amplification kits and identified a simple and flexible single cell mrna profiling kit , which provides microgram amounts of amplified cdna suitable for analysis using a wide range of downstream platforms, including high density qpcr arrays, affymetrix arrays and rna-seq. we have used this approach to successfully generate representative cdna from single cells and single cell equivalents , 1 ng purified rna  as well as from  <dig> cell pools of directly fractionated tumour cells with comparable transcriptional profiles seen across all platforms and all template inputs.

initial experiments compared gene expression profiles generated from single cell equivalent amounts of pooled mcf <dig> rna using three commercially available kits. the use of pooled rna reduced the level of biological variation that could be typically expected at the single cell level, meaning differences between the duplicate samples could be mainly attributed to technical variation. direct comparison of the three kits found that the epistem rna-amp™ kit was most sensitive, identifying  <dig> expressed genes compared to  <dig> and  <dig> with the nugen and miltenyi generated cdna respectively. it was also the most reproducible with the correlation between duplicate samples being  <dig> , compared to  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the nugen and miltenyi samples. the data from these initial experiments lead us to focus on the epistem rna-amp™ kit for further, detailed evaluation.

having found the epistem rna-amp kit to be sensitive and reproducible we then went on to determine how representative the amplified material was of the initial transcriptome of the cell. from affymetrix array analysis we established that genes identified using conventional profiling starting with 10 μg of purified rna  showed a similar pattern in amplified products from either single cells or 1 ng rna , confirming that the protocol is ‘fit for purpose’ and will identify rna changes reflecting the biological status of the starting sample. this was an important result as it confirmed that the data generated from the amplified material was biologically representative. the next question addressed was whether the amplified material could be analysed across a range of different platforms and whether the different platforms gave comparable transcriptional profiles. a comparison of genes identified by affymetrix arrays or rna-seq analysis of the same single cell amplified cdna revealed similar patterns of expression  demonstrating platform independence. interestingly, substantially more differentially expressed genes were identified by rna-seq analysis than with the affymetrix microarrays . the reason for the increased numbers of genes detected by rna-seq is not completely clear, but likely reflects the increased sensitivity and lower background of the method as well as the lack of 3’ bias and matches as seen in previously published studies  <cit> . the additional differentially expressed genes identified in the rna-seq analysis were shown to be true biological variation between the cell lines by comparing the single cell rna-seq data to the 10 μg reference data , with differentially expressed genes identified within these data sets showing significant correlation . if the additional genes identified by rna-seq were due to ‘technical noise’ we would not have expected to have seen enrichment of these transcripts in the reference data set.

finally we tested the cdna on a high density qpcr platform, using the wafergen smartchip system that enables analysis of over  <dig> wells per run, based on 100 nl reactions. the appeal of qpcr over other platforms is that it has already been established in various clinical settings, including the monitoring of ctcs  <cit> . in this study we utilised transcriptional profiles identified within our microarray data to design a panel of  <dig> qpcr amplicons predicted to be differentially expressed between the two target cell lines. we tested the expression signatures in cdna amplified from single cells, 1 ng of rna and unamplified rna and found good concordance across template inputs . these results demonstrate a potential pipeline by which rare, clinically important cells can be transcriptionally profiled using microarrays and/or rna-seq analysis of rna-amplified material, and targeted expression profiles generated from these data then monitored in multiplexed, high density qpcr assays for clinical utility.

having proven the robustness and accuracy of the rna-amp™ approach we then validated its potential clinical/research utility through analysis of highly fractionated cancer initiating cells from nsclc-pdx samples. within primary tumors, cics are functionally defined as the cellular subset responsible for generation and maintenance of tumours  <cit> , and in most solid tumors represent only a fraction of the total cellular population. recently it has been proposed that the activation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition provides tumor cells with stem-like features and dissemination ability, traits needed to carry out the metastatic process  <cit> . these findings are supported by clinical evidence in breast cancer patients showing that ctcs and bone marrow disseminated tumor cells exhibit emt and stemness features  <cit> . additional analysis of ctcs from breast cancer patients provided evidence for the existence of a definite subset of mcics, showing stemness and mesenchymal traits that possess the potential to initiate metastases  <cit> . previously we have shown that lung cancer contains a population of cd133+ cancer initiating cells, within which is a subpopulation of cd133+cxcr4+ epcam− cells that show an increased metastasis formation capability and could represent these clinically important lung mcics . therefore, it would be of great interest to determine the transcriptional profile of these rare cells and compare to other subpopulations within the tumour. however, following flow cytometric fractionation typically fewer than  <dig> mcic cells are isolated from each tumour, therefore we utilized the epistem rna-amp protocol to generate enough material from these rare cells for transcriptional profiling.

for this we amplified rna from equivalent to  <dig> cells input, and following rna-seq analysis, which in our validation experiments was found to generate the most data, we were able to clearly distinguish rna profiles from cics with an increased potential for metastasis formation  from resident cics and total tumour profiles . pathway analysis of mcic differentially expressed genes revealed a clear enrichment for a number of pathways , including a strong link to glutathione metabolism. this has potentially important clinical implications since glutathione s-transferase pi  <dig>  is known to regulate sensitivity to cytotoxic agents  and is a significant risk factor for clinical chemotherapy resistance in nsclc  <cit> . since gstp <dig> is low in the tt samples and over 100× higher in the mcic samples  this may imply selective resistance of micics. a comparison of mcic differentially expressed genes to published rna expression signatures  <cit>  showed a strong link to known emt and stem cell profiles . mcic differentially expressed genes overlapped with a range of emt signatures, including a signature derived from human lung cancer cell lines and shown to be linked with a prognostic signature in colorectal cancer  <cit> , a core signature that is produced by overexpression of twist, snail, gsc and tgf-β <dig>  <cit>  as well as an emt signature detected in cd44/cd <dig> breast cancer stem cells  <cit>  .

in addition to confirming the reported convergence of emt signatures and stem cell enrichment in the mcic population, we also detect stem cell related changes which are not obviously linked to emt, including increased expression of brca <dig> in both rcic and mcic samples . as well as its role in dna repair and breast cancer susceptibility, brca <dig> has also been implicated in mammary stem-cell self-renewal , with deletion of brca <dig> during epidermal development showing that it is required for the development of adult hair follicle stem cells  <cit> . thus, these findings support the existence of different subsets of lung cics that can be distinguished from total tumor cells by a common stemness signature, whereas the co-expression of the mesenchymal signature was able to define those tumor stem cells endowed with the greatest dissemination and metastatic potential. these data strongly suggest that by utilizing the rna-amp™ protocol to amplify rna from these rare cells has enabled us to accurately determine their transcriptional signatures and further reveal the genes and pathways involved in tumourigenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown through detailed transcriptional profiling of single cells from two control cell lines, across multiple platforms, the value and robustness of the profiling approach we describe. these results confirm that rna amplification from single cells is readily achieved, the material generated accurately reflects the transcriptional status of the initial cell, can be used for rna-seq and microarray analysis and that these data sets can be used to generate targeted expression panels that are amenable to real-time pcr analysis. this process mirrors the pipeline we envisage could be used to optimally transfer clinically important findings into a therapeutic setting.

in addition, we have validated the approach through the characterization of potential metastatic cancer initiating cells isolated from a nsclc-pdx model, with this analysis identifying a panel of emt and stem-cell associated genes with potential roles in metastatic spread. this highlights the utility of the protocol in better understanding the biology of clinically important, rare cellular populations.
