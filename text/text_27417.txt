BACKGROUND
camembert cheese is a soft, mold-ripened cheese. the mold penicillium camemberti and the yeast geotrichum candidum are the two major fungi that give the white coated characteristic of this cheese variety. their association is crucial not only for appearance, but also for typical sensory characteristics of camembert cheese  <cit> . previous studies considered aroma production in pure culture, on culture media or on model cheese medium  <cit> , biochemical pathways potentially involved in the development of sensory properties and even microbiological succession during camembert ripening  <cit> . surprisingly, only limited genetic information is available for these fungi, since fewer than  <dig> different genes of each organism have been deposited in public databases.

molecular biology techniques were recently used to evaluate several aspects of sensory characteristics of cheese. for example, multispecies dna microarrays combined with biochemical analysis  has been a useful tool to evaluate l-methionine catabolism, production of volatile sulfur compounds  and lactose/lactate consumption during yeast growth  <cit> . even though microarrays provide information about gene expression under various conditions, their utility is limited to organisms for which genetic information is available  <cit> . next-generation sequencing  methods are now widely used for de novo- and re- sequencing of genomes, transcriptomes, epigenomes and metagenomes  <cit> . the first metagenomic analysis using  <dig> pyrosequencing was performed on bacterial communities in mines  <cit>  and since then, high quality information is available about ecosystems from soil  <cit> , sea water  <cit> , humans  <cit> , and even cheese  <cit> , most of them identifying microorganisms and establishing their phylogenetic relationships  <cit> . genome and metagenome sequencing are powerful tools, but massive transcriptome sequencing using ngs provides a more dynamic and functional view of microbial activity under particular conditions by accumulating data on rna and its expression profile.

several studies used ngs technologies to compare the transcriptomic response of a single organism exposed to different conditions  <cit> . in multiple-organism environments, establishing the metatranscriptome reveals the activity of a community, but only rare and very recent papers selected this approach  <cit> . this study is the first comprehensive metatranscriptome analysis of the camembert cheese complex fungal ripening ecosystem. here, the fungal metatranscriptome was sequenced using a roche  <dig> pyrosequencing ngs strategy, without prior knowledge of the penicillium camemberti and geotrichum candidum genome sequences. the longer reads produced by the  <dig> instruments enabled the discovery and characterization of new genetic information for these fungi and simultaneously established their activity profile. many fungal activities were identified using this strategy, including the central metabolism and the response to environmental stresses and nutrient availability in the cheese matrix. this semi-quantitative gene expression profiling revealed the adaptation of g. candidum and p. camemberti during the 77-day ripening period of a commercial canadian camembert-type cheese.

RESULTS
cheese characteristics and fungal growth
commercial camembert-type cheeses made from pasteurized milk were obtained from a processing plant located in canada. cheeses used in the present study developed no obvious defects during the ripening period and met the high quality criteria of the company who provided the cheeses for the characteristics of cheese texture, fat matter, salt and water content . also, the measured ph increase fit the normal alkalinisation of the rind over time observed for similar canadian mold ripened cheeses   <cit> . when fungal strains selected for this cheese were quantified using a taqman-based qpcr method  <cit> , g. candidum and p. camemberti had similar growth profiles with an active phase in the first 5 days of ripening. their maximum cell density was  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> gene copies/cm <dig>  respectively, at the end of ripening .

sequencing and assembly of the camembert cheese transcriptome
since only scarce genetic information is available for g. candidum and p. camemberti, the metatranscriptomic approach using massive parallel sequencing had the advantage of simultaneously identifying new genes and determining their expression profile during cheese ripening. a de novo assembly performed using all  <dig> , <dig> reads generated  <dig>  contigs . after sorting data for a minimum contig length of 200 nt and a minimum of  <dig> assembled reads,  <dig>  contigs were conserved in the original cheese database. reads were mapped back to the de novo assembly to enable semi-quantitative analysis and quality control of the assembly. de novo assembly and mapping data were compared to remove artefacts, such as duplicated transcript models, resulting in the exclusion of 402/ <dig>  contigs. the assembly contigs were free of fungal rdna and mt-rdna contamination as revealed by local blast search. this high quality dataset of  <dig>  contigs  represents the fungal metatranscriptome of the canadian camembert-type cheese selected and was called camembank <dig>  henceforth compensating the absence of available sequenced genomes for ripening species penicillium camemberti and geotrichum candidum.

identification and functional annotation of contigs found in camembank01
all  <dig>  contigs were analyzed using the blast2go platform  <cit> . because no genome of the yeast g. candidum and the mold p. camemberti are currently available in public databases, sequence analysis was performed with caution. therefore, contigs were assigned according to their similarity to mold or yeast relatives if sequences had a >70% identity with known proteins in genbank. globally,  <dig> % contigs originated from molds  and  <dig> % from yeasts . the other  <dig> % was defined as of uncharacterized origin , either because the blastx protein similarity was under 70% or because they had no significant homology. over the  <dig>  reads assembled,  <dig>  reads  were confidently assigned to molds and  <dig>  reads  to yeasts, while  <dig>  reads are still unassigned. the average expression was  <dig> reads/contig, or  <dig> transcripts/gene . at each sampling time, the majority of expressed contigs originated from molds and the average proportions of m, y and u transcripts were similar over time.

information on the metabolic pathways active in the transcriptome library was obtained from the crossed-analysis of the gene ontology  annotation, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  ontology , and functional classification of clusters of eukaryotic orthologous groups   <cit> . the kog database delivered the most informative analysis, providing 10% more affiliation of transcripts to a category than go and kegg  <cit> . genes belonging to kog categories d , m , z  and b  were expressed at least 10-fold less than genes belonging to other kog categories . overall metatranscriptomic expression shows that, aside from translation  and energy metabolism , yeast transcripts dominated the early stages of ripening , while mold contigs experienced higher levels of expression around day  <dig>  these transcription data matched the active growth phase of g. candidum and p. camemberti, as quantified by qpcr   <cit> .

central metabolism
according to kog annotation, energy metabolism  was mainly expressed in the early stage of ripening . we identified numerous gene functions related to energy metabolism, including all enzymes in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate  pathways, tricarboxylic acid  cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, for both yeasts and molds. p. camemberti and g. candidum are, therefore, aerobic microorganisms capable of complete pyruvate degradation to co <dig> and atp production through carbohydrate, lipid and protein breakdown. for both fungal species, we identified  <dig> different contigs related to oxidative phosphorylation, including all five major complexes . actually, energy metabolism was the dominant biological process in camembank <dig> . moreover, key enzymes in the glyoxylate bypass, namely isocitrate lyase  and malate synthase , were found in high numbers  <cit> . in camembank <dig>  most transcripts coding for those two enzymes are present at day  <dig> . therefore, p. camemberti and g. candidum seem to be able to grow in a two-carbon source environment , when other more complex carbon sources are unavailable  <cit> .

lactose and lactate utilization in dairy fungi
the presence of lactose and galactose influence microbial and fungal community development in the cheese matrix. once β-galactosidase  hydrolyses lactose to form galactose and glucose, the latter is metabolized through the glycolysis, tca cycle and pp pathways. contigs related to lactose and galactose transport and utilization were expressed by molds only at the very beginning of cheese ripening , which is consistent with the negligible concentration of lactose in the rind after six days of ripening  <cit> . as expected, no evidence of lactose utilization was found in yeast contigs, confirming the well-known incapacity of g. candidum to assimilate lactose  <cit> .

lactate generated by lactic acid bacteria during cheese making is a major carbon source for surface fungal microflora in camembert-type cheese. its metabolism contributes to fungal growth and alkalinisation of the cheese surface  <cit> . for this purpose, a specific lactate transporter  and two distinct lactate dehydrogenases, dld <dig>  and cyb <dig>   <cit> , are essential. in camembank <dig>  contigs coding for these enzymes were found for yeasts and molds . all non-fermentable carbon sources, such as lactate, are metabolized into sugars through the gluconeogenesis pathway and then redirected into central metabolism. phosphoenolpyruvate kinase  and fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase  are two essential enzymes in this pathway. for yeasts and molds fbp and pepck are mainly expressed at days  <dig> and  <dig>  pepck is massively expressed in both yeasts and molds, especially in the latter where it is among the top 1% of the most expressed contigs in camembank <dig> . this finding is consistent with the early expression of lactate metabolism related contigs, as well as icl and mas enzyme expression profiles in the early ripening stage, because of the possible depletion of glucose and lactose . at this stage, lactate, caseins and milk lipids are the dominant remaining energy sources  <cit>  which explains the high transcription rate of the gluconeogenesis pathway. considering its importance in fungal metabolism in relation to cheese production and its high expression in camembank <dig>  the pepck transcript could be a useful biomarker to ensure the normal progression of the camembert-type cheese ripening process.

protein metabolism
proteolytic activity of fungal ripening cultures was proposed to be a key contributor to cheese flavor but only limited information is available. analysis using the merops peptidase database  <cit>   identified  <dig> peptidases and five peptidase inhibitors in the camembank <dig> metatranscriptome. from this number,  <dig>  were linked to the extracellular protein digestion category of the proteolysis activity. merops analysis revealed that metallopeptidase  and serine peptidases  are the most abundant peptidase families expressed in yeasts and molds. global expression profiles show that protease and peptidase transcripts are mainly detected in the first 21 days of the ripening period, supporting other findings indicating that proteolysis occurs mostly in the first two weeks of the ripening time  <cit> .

in the cytoplasm, peptides and amino acids are catabolized by different enzymes that lead to the formation of aroma compounds  <cit> . widely used ripening yeasts including kluyveromyces, debaryomyces, yarrowia and geotrichum are known for their volatile sulfur compound  biosynthesis through methionine degradation  <cit> . most contigs involved in vsc production  <cit>  were clustered in the kog category e in camembank <dig> . methionine catabolism and the corresponding vsc production can occur in one  or two steps  enzymatic reactions  <cit>  .

cystathionine γ-lyase  and cystathionine β-lyase   are two potential lyase candidates in the one-step generation of vsc through methionine catabolism  <cit> . in camembank <dig>  cgl and cbl transcripts were found in molds, but only cgl transcripts were found in yeasts. the expression of both cgl and cbl was observed to be higher in yeasts throughout ripening . in g. candidum, cgl expression is linked to cabbage and sulfur aroma development in smear cheeses through methanethiol  production  <cit> . at an expression level of  <dig> reads, cgl is among the top 5% of expressed contigs in camembank <dig> and is a good candidate for producing the cabbage and sulphur notes g. candidum is known for  <cit> . these data suggest that g. candidum could be more involved in aroma and ammonia production through methionine catabolism than p. camemberti, considering that these enzymes are also linked to ammonia and α-ketobutyric acid production in g. candidum <cit> .

transamination of methionine leading to mtl formation can be initiated by aminotansferases   <cit> . in dairy fungi the proposed pathway includes branched-chain  and aromatic aminotransferases  essential for flavor formation in k. lactis, g. candidum and yarrowia lipolytica <cit> . the next step of transamination is responsible for ammonia generation and is catalyzed by the nad-glutamate dehydrogenase enzyme    <cit> . in camembank <dig>  bcat, arat and gdh contigs were retrieved for yeasts and molds. the nad-gdh contig was only found in yeasts . this observation confirms that g. candidum uses peptides and amino acids for energy metabolism and cellular growth, which contributes greatly to ammonia production and ph increase in cheese, while p. camemberti uses lactate  <cit> . according to the transcription data in camembank <dig>  ammonia production and amino acid metabolism appear after the first week of ripening. formation of α-keto-γ-methylthio butyric acid  and mtl through the ehrlich pathway may need an enzyme called kmba demethiolase. such a gene was not found in camembank <dig> and suggests, as others have previously stated, that the conversion of kmba in mtl could be spontaneous and non-enzymatic  <cit> . in light of these observations, camembank <dig> outlines the need and provides the ability to investigate these metabolic pathways in depth, and to correlate these data with biochemical analysis.

lipid metabolism
lipids have major roles in camembert-type cheeses since they modulate the texture, act as the carrier for aroma compounds and are the major precursor for flavor compounds such as methylketones, lactones, esters and alcohols  <cit> . the lipid metabolism kog category  is divided in two groups: fatty acid metabolism and cell wall-related lipid metabolism. functional annotation of all contigs in camembank <dig> showed that fatty acid transport and metabolism counted for more than half of all of lipid metabolism  contigs found in camembank <dig> . lipolysis pathways are expressed at the beginning of the ripening period; gene expression is limited at day  <dig> but increased at days  <dig> and  <dig> . seven transporters were also found, which had the same expression profile as all other lipid-related contigs.

yeasts and molds that participate in the ripening of camembert-type cheeses are known to possess lipases  that hydrolyse triglycerides into di- and mono-glycerides, free fatty acids  and glycerol. only a few lipase transcripts were found in camembank <dig>  according to go annotation, all three lipases found have triglyceride lipase activity and, for g. candidum, two such enzymes were previously identified in the literature  <cit> . in both yeasts and molds, the contigs encoding lipase genes were expressed during the entire ripening period, but at a very low rate , which is consistent with the globally low expression of the lipolysis pathway genes compared to those of other metabolic pathways .

yeasts such as saccharomyces and candida appear to possess only the peroxisomal version of the β-oxidation pathway  <cit> , while aspergillus and podospora possess both peroxisomal and mitochondrial pathways  <cit> , consistent with camembank <dig> expression data. camembank <dig> expression data does not indicate the presence of a mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway in g. candidum but both pathways were identified in p. camemberti. each cycle of β-oxidation produces one molecule of acetyl-coa that can be redirected into the tca cycle to generate energy or transformed in ketone bodies , and one molecule of acyl-coa that can go through other β-oxidation cycles . in fungi, a peroxisomal multifunctional enzyme  is also responsible for the β-oxidation of fatty acids  <cit> . this enzyme combines the two middle steps  of the β-oxidation cycle . in camembank <dig>  we found the four enzymatic functions, including the mfe. the mfe’s expression profile is very different for yeasts and molds: in molds, it is expressed for most of the  <dig>  month period of ripening, whereas in yeasts, it is clearly over-expressed at day  <dig> . interestingly, 69% of all transcripts related to the β-oxidation cycle in yeast-related contigs coded for the mfe, suggesting that this enzyme could have a central biological role. in yeasts, mfe is the second most highly expressed of all lipolysis-related contigs, after the acyl-coa synthase  . the acyl-coa synthase accounted for 44% of the total lipolysis-related transcripts. in molds, approximately 21% of transcripts coded for these two enzymes combined. from the perspective of finding potential biomarkers for camembert-type cheese ripening, the multi-functional enzyme could be one of interest, given its expression over time in both microorganisms.

in the last degradation step of fatty acids, 3-ketoacyl-coa is redirected in the tca cycle through a 3-ketoacyl-coa thiolase  activity  <cit> . the high expression level in molds  at the very end of the ripening period suggests that fatty acids are late energy sources for molds and that this gene could be an interesting biomarker to follow this activity. finally, some fatty acids are only partially β-oxidized. thioesterases, decarboxylases and reductases are then responsible for the potential production of methylketones and secondary alcohols, which are important aroma compounds in camembert-type cheese  <cit> . during the ripening period of a camembert-type cheese, fatty acids may be entirely degraded for energy production by p. camemberti and g. candidum. in fact, very few transcripts related to partial β-oxidation were found only in molds in camembank <dig>  . however, these findings confirm the hypothesis that p. camemberti has a higher lipolytic potential than g. candidum and its gene expression should be investigated more extensively  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
overall,  <dig> new contigs have been identified related to the metabolism of yeasts and molds that develop at the surface of a commercial canadian camembert-type cheese, increasing our knowledge about fungal metabolism. considering that this cheese ecosystem was composed of two fungal strains, these data suggest that the transcripts associated with yeasts and molds potentially reflect the activity of geotrichum candidum and penicillium camemberti. camembank <dig> permitted us to simultaneously determine the sequence of a large part of the genetic information encoded by these two microorganisms and detail the expression of these putative genes. since the previous genetic information available was mostly ribosomal dna, camembank <dig> provides a data mining resource for the dairy fungi scientific community. whole genome sequencing improves knowledge of the genetic structure of an organism  <cit> , while the comparison between genome sequences allows understanding the evolutionary structure of populations  <cit> . we demonstrated that ngs approach for transcriptome analysis is a powerful tool for acquiring massive genetic information in a given biological condition. therefore, camembank <dig> can now contribute to the structural annotation of the genomic sequences of p. camemberti and g. candidum, when they will be available. moreover, this new database has shown the genomic determinants responsible for the enzymatic and biochemical reactions occurring during soft cheese ripening, previously described by other authors. this metatranscriptome analysis helped to both demonstrate the presence and the expression of these genes in the cheese ripening process. globally, for yeasts and molds, the same general functions  seem to be participating in fungal metabolism during camembert-type cheese ripening. these pathways are not only the most expressed in camembank <dig>  but also the most relevant in terms of sensory properties. selection and study of biological markers should be the next step in understanding the real contribution of individual fungal strains and the consortium. it is crucial to carry out a more in-depth study of their biochemical activity during cheese ripening, which will provide key information about their implication in the development of cheese flavor.
