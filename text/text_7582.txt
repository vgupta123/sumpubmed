BACKGROUND
organisms with a chromosome number that is not an even multiple of the haploid chromosome number are termed aneuploids. alterations in the dosage of portions of a chromosome, such as the presence of an extra arm of a chromosome, are referred to as segmental aneuploidy. changes in chromosome number frequently lead to phenotypic consequences. some of the earliest studies of genetic mutants actually involved chromosomal alterations instead of point mutations . analysis of a complete set of maize monosomic lines reveals that most monosomic lines display a reduction in stature; additionally, specific phenotypes are associated with each monosomic condition  <cit> . trisomic lines have been widely used for mapping in many plant species and numerous phenotypes have been associated with certain chromosomes  <cit> . in humans, aneuploidy for most chromosomes results in lethality. aneuploidy is only tolerated for chromosome  <dig>  and the sex chromosomes . most of the cancerous somatic human cells have been shown to carry different aneuploid chromosome sets . despite the widespread interest in aneuploidy we still have a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to phenotypic alterations in aneuploid organisms.

various models have been proposed to explain the phenotypic consequences caused by aneuploidy. the simplest model suggests that all genes in the aneuploid region will display increased or decreased transcript levels in direct proportion with their structural dosage and that the dosage imbalance of genes on the altered chromosome relative to genes located on other chromosomes leads to phenotypic consequences. a second, non-mutually exclusive, model posits that slight alterations in the expression level of transcription factors, or other regulatory proteins, might result in perturbations of regulatory networks such that genes located throughout the genome may be up- or down-regulated. other models have suggested complex interactions that might result in drastic alterations of expression levels. some of the major questions regarding gene expression and aneuploidy are:  what proportion of genes within the affected regions exhibit dosage dependent alterations in expression levels,  how common is altered expression for genes located on chromosomes not involved in the aneuploidy and  how common are expression changes that are more severe than the dosage alteration would predict.

several studies have examined gene expression patterns in maize aneuploids. alterations in the genomic dosage of the adh <dig> gene from  <dig> to  <dig> copies do not result in concordant changes to the expression level  <cit> . this is likely due to the presence of a negative regulator on the same chromosome such that the balance of the regulatory and adh <dig> genes is constant as chromosome dosage changes  <cit> . guo and birchler  <cit>  used fourteen b-a translocation stocks to study the effects of aneuploidy on the expression of six maize genes. three of the genes, adh <dig>  adh <dig> and glb <dig>  did not show any significant change in gene expression in either a monosomic or trisomic state, suggesting the occurrence of dosage compensation. interestingly, the expression level of all six of these genes was often sensitive to dosage of other regions and showed tissue-specific differences. for example, when the dosage of the long arm of chromosome  <dig> was increased, the expression of adh <dig> and sus <dig> expression in the embryo decreased while endosperm expression of glb <dig> and zein increased even though none of these genes are located on chromosome  <dig>  gene expression levels are much more sensitive to aneuploid changes than they are to changes in ploidy level  <cit> . similarly, a study of trisomic tomato plants found evidence for dosage dependent expression changes for  <dig> of  <dig> genes tested  <cit> .

the effects of aneuploidy on gene expression have also been examined in humans and mice. there have been conflicting reports on the frequency of genes that exhibit expression changes in individuals trisomic for chromosome  <dig>  <cit> ). in some studies of multiple tissues there was evidence for global up-regulation of genes on chromosome  <dig> in patients with trisomic  <dig>  <cit> . however, another study found that only ~30% of the expressed genes on chromosome  <dig> exhibit altered expression level  <cit> . these differences might be due to difficulties in accurately monitoring small changes  in gene expression. studies of mouse models for down syndrome have found that many of the genes that are located in the trisomic regions display a 50% increase in expression level  <cit> . the general consensus from studies of mammalian trisomics has been that many of the genes with altered expression map to the trisomic chromosome but that there are also examples of genes in other genomic locations with altered expression levels.

in this study we have monitored the phenotypic alterations and gene expression changes that occur in a maize segmental aneuploid. these lines were initially developed in an attempt to create a genetic male sterility system for maize  <cit> . this segmental aneuploid carries three copies for most of the short arm of chromosome  <dig> and displays a phenotypic syndrome that includes leaf development alteration, delayed flowering and floral morphology changes.

RESULTS
segmental aneuploid plants derived from t5-6b display phenotypic abnormalities
adjacent i disjunction of a plant that is heterozygous for t5-6b  can result in the production of a viable duplicate-deficient  gamete. this gamete, which has a duplication for the majority of the short arm of chromosome  <dig> and is deficient for a small region of chromosome  <dig>  is female transmissible but can not be transmitted through the male parent  <cit> . the fertilization of this female dpdf gamete by a normal male gamete results in the production of a plant with segmental aneuploidy. these plants contain three copies of the majority of the short arm of chromosome  <dig> and only one copy of a small portion of the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  and are referred herein as dpdf. the dpdf plants display a phenotypic syndrome that includes leaf knotting, partial tassel sterility, late flowering time and overall changes in the plant architecture . dpdf plants are shorter than their wild-type siblings and have smaller stalk diameter . the flowering time of dpdf plants is delayed 8â€“ <dig> days relative to their wild-type siblings. the tassels of dpdf plants are shorter and thicker compared to wild-type siblings and have a smaller number of branches. notably, the tassels of dpdf plants are partially necrotic and produce many branches with few to no developed florets . the phenotypic syndrome of dpdf plants is more severe in dpdf plants produced from self-pollinated dpdfs  than in the first generation dpdf plants, suggesting the accumulation of phenotypic effects when the segmental aneuploid condition is maintained for multiple generations. to understand the molecular basis of the other phenotypic alterations in the dpdf plants, we used a more comprehensive approach and looked at changes in gene transcription levels caused by segmental aneuploidy.

aneuploidy causes limited changes at the transcript level
the altered gene dosage in a segmental aneuploid is expected to result in a dosage-dependent change in gene expression for all genes within the affected regions. therefore, it is expected that many of the expressed genes on the duplicated region of 5s will show  <dig>  fold increase in transcript level relative to wild-type siblings while genes on the deficient portion of chromosome  <dig> will mostly show  <dig>  fold decrease in transcript levels relative to wild-type siblings. due to gene interactions and regulation networks, it is also possible that alteration in the transcription levels of certain transcription factors might affect transcriptional networks and result in altered expression of genes located throughout the genome. we interrogated maize affymetrix microarrays containing probes for ca.  <dig>  genes with rna samples from dpdf and wild-type plants to study the effects of segmental aneuploidy on the maize transcriptome. in this study we investigated gene transcript levels and use the word "expression" to refer to the abundance of rna transcripts, not proteins. although the most severe phenotypic abnormalities were observed in floral and mature leaf tissues, the developmental delay in dpdf plants relative to wild-type siblings complicated our ability to perform controlled sampling of these tissues for microarray studies. therefore, we chose to sample 11-day old seedlings as these tissues display very little phenotypic difference between wild-type and dpdf siblings and there are few developmental transitions occurring at this phase of vegetative growth. at the 11-day seedling stage it is not possible to distinguish between dpdf plants and wild-type siblings without molecular marker analyses. pooled rna samples were prepared from four biological replicates from dpdf plants and their wild-type siblings and used for microarray hybridization. a series of statistical tests, ratio cut-offs and expression level criteria were applied to identify a set of  <dig> differentially expressed genes . we found that most  of the differentially expressed genes exhibit increased transcript levels in dpdf plants relative to wild-type siblings . in conformity with an expected dosage-dependent change in expression, the vast majority  of the differentially expressed genes exhibited less than a two-fold change in transcript levels in wild-type relative to dpdf plants. analysis of the go annotations for the differentially expressed genes did not reveal evidence for over-representation of any functional categories .

seventeen of the differentially expressed genes are more than 2-fold changed in comparisons of dpdf and wild-type plants . these included  <dig> examples of up-regulation in dpdf plants and six examples of down-regulation in dpdf plants. we confirmed expression change by rt-pcr and determined the chromosomal location for fifteen of these seventeen genes using identity with mapped maize bac contigs and experimentally by mapping with the oat Ã— maize chromosome addition lines  <cit> . eight of the ten genes that displayed greater than 2-fold increased transcript levels in dpdf plants mapped to chromosome  <dig> . the other two genes mapped to chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  each of the five down-regulated genes that were tested mapped to the distal portion of chromosome 6s, probably in the monosomic region. rt-pcr was used to confirm the expression differences observed using microarrays. interestingly, for  <dig> of  <dig> up-regulated genes and for all  <dig> down-regulated genes that were tested, we observed transcripts in only wild-type or only aneuploid plants . in each of these cases we were only able to detect transcripts in either wild-type or dpdf plants following  <dig> cycles of pcr. the other four up-regulated genes showed evidence of expression in both dpdf and wild-type with quantitative variation. we proceeded to assess the expression differences in two different tissues from wild-type or dpdf individual plants . one of these genes, l <dig>  was ectopically expressed in mature leaf tissue in dpdf plants similar to the expression observed for knox <dig> . another gene, ai <dig>  exhibited more severe up-regulation in the meristem derived tissue . for the majority of genes, including bm <dig>  bm <dig>  ay <dig> and bm <dig>  both meristem and leaf tissue exhibited the altered expression patterns .

aexpression validation was assessed as "present/absent" when amplicons were only detected in either dpdf or wild-type. semi-quanitative indicates that expression was detected in both dpdf and wildtype with semi-quantitative variation in agreement with the microarray results.

genomic distribution of differentially expressed genes
we were interested in determining the genomic distribution of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes to determine whether they occurred primarily within the segmental aneuploid regions. although the maize genome sequencing effort was still in progress, over one third of the bacs were sequenced and mapped at the time of analysis ; therefore, it was possible to determine map positions for a large subset of array features. a computational effort was implemented to map affymetrix consensus probe sequences to maize bac or overgo  <cit>  sequences. in many cases the maize bacs have been characterized by hicf  and placed in contigs. many of these contigs have been tied to the maize genetic map through the hybridization of genetically mapped sequences to the bac clones. the implementation of this computational approach resulted in putative map positions for ~ <dig>  of the  <dig>  genes present on the affymetrix array . this approach may result in obtaining incorrect map positions due to improper alignments to the wrong bac end sequences , incorrect bac contigs or incorrect placement of a bac contig onto the physical map of maize. however, we validated map positions for  <dig> mapped features chosen at random using the oat Ã— maize chromosome addition lines  <cit>  and radiation hybrid oat Ã— maize lines  <cit>  and found that  <dig> of the  <dig> features were correctly mapped to the proper chromosome region using our computational approach. applying these rates, we would predict that the computationally inferred map locations are likely to be accurate for ~95% of the ~ <dig>  features.

we proceeded to analyze the genome-wide distribution of the differentially expressed genes . map positions were inferred for  <dig> of the  <dig> of the differentially expressed genes, including  <dig> genes that were up-regulated in dpdf plants and  <dig> genes that were down-regulated in dpdf plants. three-fourths of the up-regulated genes  are located within the region of chromosome 5s that is present in three copies . the remaining  <dig> genes map to genomic locations that are not involved in the segmental aneuploidy, suggesting the existence of gene regulation and interaction networks. the  <dig> genes that are down-regulated in dpdf plants include  <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig> and most of these are likely within the region that is present in only one copy. the remaining  <dig> down-regulated genes are distributed throughout the genome .

we were interested in assessing the proportion of genes on chromosome 5s that display dosage-dependent alterations in gene expression. a set of  <dig> genes for which we had good positional information to suggest they were located within the trisomic region were analyzed in more detail . this list of genes was filtered to identify the  <dig> genes that were expressed in wild-type seedlings  of these genes were identified as up-regulated in dpdf plants,  <dig> gene was down-regulated and  <dig> genes were not affected in dpdf plants. using the oat Ã— maize radiation hybrids we were able to validate the map position for 19/ <dig> of these genes to chromosome 5s . the one gene that was not validated to map to chromosome  <dig> appears to be a member of a multi-gene family with copies present on  <dig> and other maize chromosomes. analysis of the distribution of these  <dig> genes on the chromosome indicated that there was no positional bias for the responsiveness to dosage . we compared the go annotation for the genes on the region of 5s chromosome duplicated in dpdf plants that were dosage-sensitive to those that were dosage-insensitive. we did not find any evidence for statistical over-representation of any functional categories . we also did not notice a correlation between the expression level of a gene and its likelihood to be sensitive to dosage changes.

a second approach was used to assess the proportion of genes within the aneuploid region of chromosome  <dig> that exhibit dosage-dependent changes in expression level. we made the assumption that genes with no alteration in expression level in dpdf plants relative to normal siblings will exhibit a normalized distribution of ratios centered at the value of  <dig>  if this assumption is correct then the number of genes with a dpdf:wild-type ratio less than  <dig> will be one half of the genes that do not exhibit dosage-dependent alterations in expression level. we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> genes exhibit a ratio less than  <dig>  this suggests that  <dig> of the  <dig> genes  do not exhibit any evidence for altered expression in the aneuploid state while the remaining 54% of genes exhibit some level of increased expression as a result of increase dosage. these frequencies are quite similar to those obtained using per-gene statistical tests for differential expression as described above. in contrast, when we assessed the distribution of all values not located on chromosome 5s or 6s we found a normalized distribution centered near  <dig>  this suggests that aneuploidy does not have genome-wide directional affects on gene expression for regions without altered dosage.

alteration in expression pattern of the knox <dig> gene causes leaf knotting in dpdf plants
a notable difference between dpdf plants and wild-type siblings in the b <dig> background is the presence of knots on the leaves  that tend to cluster near the midrib, but in severely affected plants they can be found throughout the leaf blade. these knots are visible on both adaxial and abaxial surfaces of the leaf. the leaf knotting phenotype was only noticed in the b <dig> genetic background. when the translocation was present in other genetic backgrounds  we did not notice the knotting phenotype. the presence of knots on the leaf blade is a unique phenotypic condition widely characterized at the molecular and genetic level; thus providing us with the opportunity to study the possible causes of leaf knot formation in dpdf plants in more detail  <cit> .

knotting can be caused by ectopic expression of class  <dig> knotted-like  genes that act as meristem-identity genes in developing leaf tissue  <cit> . a subset of the knox genes, the class i knox genes, show expression specifically in the meristem tissue  <cit> . however, prolonged ectopic expression of knox genes in differentiating leaf primordia is thought to lead to aberrant differentiation of some cells in the leaf blade resulting in the acquisition of sheath or ligule identity  <cit> . the maize genome contains at least  <dig> knox genes   <cit> , with one gene, knox <dig>  located in the trisomic region of dpdf plants . the knox <dig> gene is also located on chromosome  <dig> but proximal to the translocation breakpoint . we investigated the expression of all nine class  <dig> knotted-like maize genes in the meristematic and leaf tissue of the normal and dpdf 11-day old maize seedlings by rt-pcr . all nine of the investigated knox genes exhibited detectable expression in meristematic tissue of both normal and dpdf plants. we were not able to detect expression for any of these nine genes in developing and mature leaf tissue of wild-type plants. in dpdf plants, ectopic expression of knox <dig> was detected in developing and mature leaf tissues while expression of the other eight genes was not detected in these tissues . the microarray profiling of the expression levels  for the four class  <dig> knox genes, knox <dig>  knox <dig>  knox <dig>  and knox <dig> showed no changes in dpdf plants compared to their normal siblings in whole seedling tissues. therefore, only the knox <dig> gene was expressed in leaves of dpdf plants suggesting that the change in expression pattern of knox <dig> is responsible for the leaf knotting phenotype.

the knox <dig> gene is normally expressed in multiple meristematic tissues including kernels, seedlings, immature ears and tassels, but not in endosperm, roots or mature leaves . an analysis of the expression level of knox <dig> in meristematic tissue suggests that the expression level for this gene is slightly higher in dpdf plants than in wild-type siblings . however, in leaf tissue, the difference between wild-type and dpdf is not a fold change but presence versus absence of the knox <dig> transcript. it is interesting that this is a potential case in which the specific level of expression may not be as critical as the altered tissue-specific pattern of expression caused by segmental aneuploidy.

discussion
while there is a significant amount of evidence to link aneuploidy to phenotypic syndromes or diseases, relatively little is known about the specific molecular mechanisms. in this study we documented the phenotypic alterations in a maize segmental aneuploid and studied gene expression changes. these studies allowed us to speculate on the inheritance of aneuploid syndromes, the causes of specific phenotypes in aneuploid organisms and the prevalence of expression changes that are conditioned by aneuploidy.

inheritance of aneuploid syndromes
one particularly interesting finding was that the severity of the aneuploid syndrome became more pronounced following multiple generations in the aneuploid state. for many of the phenotypes that were scored, a first generation dpdf plant  exhibited less severe phenotypes than a dpdf plant that was produced by an aneuploid parent. maintaining plants in an aneuploid state for more than two generations did not result in noticeably more severe phenotypes. we are not aware of other studies in plants or animals that have assessed the severity of aneuploid syndromes in the first generation compared to later generations.

expression changes in a maize segmental aneuploid
the expression profiling of dpdf plants relative to euploid siblings allows us to address three important questions about aneuploidy and gene expression. first, what proportion of genes within the affected region of the genome will exhibit altered expression? second, how common are expression changes for genes that map to other genomic locations? third, how common are alterations of gene expression that are of greater magnitude than would be predicted by the altered dosage?

there have been reports of genes that exhibit expression changes when the dosage of the gene is altered and genes with no expression changes despite altered copy number  <cit> . analysis of  <dig> expressed genes on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> indicates that approximately half of these genes  display increased expression levels in plants that are trisomic for this region. we could not detect enrichment for specific functional classifications of genes in the dosage dependent or independent gene lists. in addition, there is no evidence for chromosomal domains within the aneuploid segments that are dosage dependent or independent. it is somewhat surprising that such a large proportion of genes do not exhibit altered expression levels when the dosage of the gene is altered. this may reflect the presence of an autosomal dosage compensation system as suggested by  <cit> .

our data can be used to assess the relative frequency of trans-acting changes conditioned by segmental aneuploidy. studies of both plant  <cit>  and animal  <cit>  aneuploids have noted expression changes for some genes that are located in regions of the genome that are not affected by the aneuploidy. this is likely attributable to perturbation of regulatory networks or altering the dosage of trans-acting factors that affect transcription. this phenomenon was also noted in our expression profiling experiments. we found that  <dig> of the  <dig>  of the up-regulated genes with map positions were located in chromosomal regions not affected by the aneuploidy. the similar number of genes with increased  or decreased  transcript levels that map to positions in the genome not affected by aneuploidy suggests that the perturbations of regulatory networks by increasing the dosage of 5s is equally likely to result in up- or down-regulation of the targets. while we did certainly find evidence for regulatory networks and trans-acting effects of altered dosage it should be noted that these were relatively rare. of the ~ <dig>  genes that are present on the array and map to genomic regions that are not part of the affected regions, only  <dig> %  exhibited altered expression. this may reflect a limited role for the perturbation of regulatory networks by aneuploidy or it may reflect the fact that the short arm of chromosome  <dig> contains relatively few factors that are involved in dosage-sensitive regulatory networks.

the majority of genes with differential expression exhibit the expected  <dig>  fold change within the trisomic region. there were only a limited number of genes with expression changes in excess of the predicted 50% increase. interestingly, many of these genes  mapped to the regions involved in the segmental aneuploidy. we might have predicted that these expression changes would be the result of the perturbation of a regulatory network that might cause the down-stream targets to exhibit more severe variation. overall, this suggests that the majority of expression changes within aneuploids are of relatively small magnitude and that perturbation of trans-acting regulatory networks rarely results in major expression level changes.

altered expression patterns in a maize segmental aneuploid
a particularly interesting finding was the developmental variation for altered expression patterns in the dpdf plants. for some of the genes with severe expression variation  the expression changes were more pronounced in specific tissues. therefore, the presence of developmental phenotypes may be linked to differences in expression pattern, not the absolute level of gene expression. the causes of the knotted phenotypes in maize have been well characterized. the class i knox genes are meristem identity genes that must be repressed to allow for proper leaf initiation and development. prolonged expression in developing leaves often results in knotting of the leaves. we found that the class i knox gene knox <dig> is not properly regulated in dpdf plants. instead, this gene is ectopically expressed in developing leaf tissue and is the likely cause of this specific aspect of the phenotype. it is possible that many of the developmental phenotypes associated with aneuploid syndromes are the result of altered expression patterns and not altered expression levels. further studies are necessary to characterize the exact molecular mechanisms that lead to altered expression patterns in aneuploidy.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have examined the gene expression and phenotypic differences between segmental aneuploid maize plants and wild-type siblings. we found that some of the genes within the aneuploid regions exhibit dosage-dependant expression changes while other expressed genes within the aneuploid regions do not exhibit any expression differences. the finding that many expressed genes with altered genomic dosage do not exhibit expression differences suggests that dosage-compensation is occurring. relatively few genes located in genomic regions not affected by the segmental aneuploidy exhibit altered expression levels. we found that these dpdf plants exhibit a leaf knotting phenotype that is likely caused by ectopic expression of the homeobox gene knox <dig>  it is possible that many of the phenotypic abnormalities exhibited by aneuploid individuals may be the result of altered expression patterns, not altered expression levels.
