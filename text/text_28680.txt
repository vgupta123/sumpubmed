BACKGROUND
the turbot  is a commercially valuable flatfish that has been intensively cultured for the last decade. its production has steadily increased to  <dig> tonnes in  <dig>  and represents one of the most promising aquaculture species in europe. however, disease outbreaks in turbot have occurred frequently and losses due to infections constitute a serious problem for its culture  <cit> . the use of antibiotics, vaccines and fish health management practices has partially solved the problem, but the achievement of large-scale production in the highly competitive world market requires enhancing resistance of cultured fish to diseases. information on the immune response of turbot is still limited, and little is known about host-pathogen interactions in fish species. the screening and identification of immune-relevant genes is essential to analyze the genetic basis for infection, immunity and resistance to pathogens of economic relevance in aquaculture. expressed sequence tag  analysis is a powerful approach to provide a rapid and efficient method to go from expressed sequences to genes. ests are essential for studies of gene function  <cit> , but are also useful to identify polymorphic gene markers, such as microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> . these markers are the basis for genetic and physical mapping, and for comparative genome analysis  <cit> . from a practical perspective, maps can be applied for assisted selection programmes  and eventually for identification of genes related with quantitative traits   <cit> . in addition, ests constitute the basic resources to develop microarrays for functional genomics studies  <cit> .

est sequence resources are rapidly growing in molecular databases. however, the number of ests in fish is generally scarce, excluding some model species and atlantic salmon among cultured fish  <cit> . the scarcity of est resources in cultured fish limits the use of modern functional genomic approaches for selective breeding purposes  <cit> . among flatfish, aquaculture production has been successfully achieved in turbot, japanese flounder and atlantic halibut. compared to the very large efforts for the development of est resources in japanese flounder  and atlantic halibut   <cit> , est resources in turbot are scarce . less than  <dig> sequences have been deposited to date in the ncbi nucleotide database, most of them from anonymous microsatellite searching  <cit> .

with the aim of increasing the genomic resources in turbot and identifying relevant genes for immunity, three cdna libraries were constructed from mrna isolated from immunity-related tissues of turbot  at different times after infection with aeromonas salmonicida and the scuticociliate parasite philasterides dicentrarchi. these pathogens are responsible for important disease outbreaks in turbot, as well as in other culture fish species  <cit> . our main goal was to obtain the most accurate information possible to address functional genomic studies on disease resistance. however, the use of non-normalized cdna libraries made it feasible to get a preliminary picture of the turbot genetic response to pathogens through analyzing transcript distribution among infected vs. control libraries. a total of  <dig> ests were sequenced and compared to genbank database and a large array of defence or immune-related genes was identified. also, this large scale est study increased the number of putative markers for mapping. a total of  <dig> microsatellites, of which  <dig> exhibited sufficient flanking sequences for primer design, and  <dig> good quality snps were identified for the first time in turbot. the cdna sequences generated will serve as a basis for microarray construction. this first est study in turbot will provide the support for further research into the genetics, genomics and even proteomics of this important aquaculture species.

RESULTS
cdna libraries and ests
est analysis is an efficient and fast method for gene discovery  <cit> . in pleuronectiformes, this approach has been recently applied in japanese flounder , winter flounder , flounder  and atlantic halibut . this approach allowed an analysis of the turbot response to specific pathogens by comparing the amount of transcripts across all genes or groups of genes classified in functional categories. a total of  <dig> ests were sequenced. after trimming and vector removal  <dig> high quality ests were obtained , showing an average length of  <dig> bp. their sequences are available in the dbest ncbi database under numbers fe943103-fe <dig> 

est projects generate a large number of redundant sequences due to the random selection of cdnas from tissue libraries, especially when libraries are non-normalized and a high number of clones are sequenced. clustering redundant sequences is a critical step to identify genes. the program cap <dig>  was used to cluster est sequences using the default parameters. as shown in table  <dig>  clustering yielded  <dig> unique turbot sequences:  <dig> singletons  and  <dig> contigs  comprising  <dig> ests  and an average length of  <dig> bp. figure 1a shows the histogram distribution of contig sizes. although most contigs showed two  or three-to-five  sequences, a small number of highly expressed genes were also detected. as shown in figure 1b, the beta-globin contig  and five others contained more than  <dig> ests, which represents a high proportion  over the total redundancy . most of these ests shared homology with genes involved in transport, protein metabolism and response to stress, all of which related to defence. at the other extreme,  <dig> % of the  <dig> contigs were ≤  <dig> times redundant, indicating that most of these unique sequences represent rare mrnas and that these libraries provide a rich source of sequence information.

gene annotation
ests were identified by blast searches against nucleotide database at genbank. due to the low representation of fish genes, a protein-based homology strategy was also used in the international database searches. protein sequences have been demonstrated to be more suitable to detect homology over long periods of evolutionary time  <cit> . our est database pprovided a graphical view of all contigs, their prosite/prints protein patterns and a search interface by keywords, microsatellite, gene, and unigene/go/kegg information. tools to search for sequences and markers based on annotations, to perform local blast searches, and to select sequences for a prospective microarray were also included. these tools used repeatmasker  for masking low-complexity sequences and oligoarray  <dig>   to predict secondary structures and potential cross-hybridization.

as shown in table  <dig>   <dig>  unique sequences displayed no significant similarity to known sequences or ests in the public databases, whereas the remaining  <dig>  showed significant matches with e-values ≤ 1e- <dig>  among these, blast database searches allowed assignment of putative function to  <dig> sequences . in spite of their lower frequency among unique sequences, contigs were annotated more frequently  than singletons . as in other ests fish studies, the lower percentage of annotated singletons suggests that these are either novel fish-specific or rapidly evolving genes  <cit> . also, it is possible that bioinformatic errors could have a greater impact on singletons, since they are unique sequences whose information cannot be contrasted with other sequences in the database. the lower annotation success regarding similar genomic projects  <cit>  was probably related to the read length  and specially the direction  of sequencing. the 3' untranslated region  is approximately double the length of the 5'utr according to genbank fish entries. so, what is gained in specificity for microarray oligo-design is lost for gene annotation.

all unique sequences were annotated based on similarity using blastx or blastn  <cit>  in the public databases genbank nr and unigene. the multiple annotations provided greater assurance about gene description and frequency of annotation than in a single database. the use of consensus sequences allowed sequences without significant similarity regions with a known protein  to be annotated if they were members of an annotated contig. all hits with e-value ≤ 1e- <dig> and their associated alignments were stored in the database and tracked with any associated functional annotation. we also ran autofact  <cit>  on all sequences in the database. it is interesting to note that while autofact was able to come up with more function-specific information than our online tool , it was not able to annotate as many sequences as our online custom tool.

annotated ests  were classified into functional categories according to go terms  <cit>  ,  <dig> among contigs  and  <dig> among singletons . a single sequence very often showed several go terms in the same ontology, so we try to group them using a single more general category. overly specific categories were also collapsed into more general terms. any terms related to defence/immunity were always retained given their interest in this study. biological process, molecular function and cellular component categories are shown in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. according to these criteria, biological processes associated with proteins  were the largest annotated categories, though a significant group related to transport and response to stress did appear. in accordance with this, a large proportion of sequences were classified into structural constituent of ribosome and protein-related functions  regarding molecular function. a remarkably high proportion of annotated sequences were categorized as oxidoreductase activity. finally, most gene activity was located into the ribosome, followed by the membrane, nucleus and the extracellular and cytoplasm constituents of the cell.

immune genes
systematic classification of annotated sequences using available bioinformatics tools  provides a useful information to analyze the functional profile of annotated genes. in our study, we were especially interested in identifying immune genes or in a broader sense those genes regulated in response to specific pathogens of turbot. so, we analyzed the relationship of our annotated genes with defence or immunity using scientific literature information available on vertebrates. according to this analysis,  <dig> genes out of  <dig> annotated  appeared related to defence or immunity in our work . this observation is in agreement with the important role of liver, spleen and head kidney in the immune response of fish.

"no. unique sequences" refers to the total amount of the different annotated contigs and singletons for each gene class listed in the table. "total percentage" of defence/immune-related genes is referred to the number of unique annotated sequences from turbot libraries .

like in mammals, the immune system of fish is composed of non-specific and specific defence. the innate immune response is an important and highly developed defence mechanism against pathogens in fish  <cit> . examples of innate immunity include anatomic barriers, mechanical removal of pathogens, bacterial antagonism, pattern-recognition receptors, antigen-nonspecific defence compounds, complement pathways, phagocytosis, and inflammation  <cit> . in table  <dig>  a list of defence/immune-related genes that were found three or more times in our libraries is shown. complement related genes were predominant  followed by apoptosis  and immunoglobulin -related  genes. glutathione s-transferase, heat shock proteins and cytochrome p <dig>  elastases, major histocompatibility complex  and coagulation factors involved in innate immunity were also present, as well as others like interferon, perforin, hepcidin, nephrosin or alpha-2-macroglobulin. interestingly, the majority of our immune-related cdnas  were reported for the first time in turbot, even though some of them have important roles in the immune response like b-cell linker, chemotaxin, complement components, igd, igm, interferon stimulated gene  <dig> , lipopolysaccharide -binding protein, natural killer -lysine type  <dig>  peptidoglycan recognition protein, skin mucus lectin and tumour necrosis factor  receptor associated factor <dig>  among others. previously, only a hepcidin  <cit>  and a natural killer cell enhancing factor  <cit>  had been characterized in turbot.

the availability of a large number of sequences from immune-related cdna libraries, both from non-infected fish  as well as from fish challenged with specific pathogens, suggested a comparison of transcript profiles to identify genes regulated in response to these pathogens. four or more sequences per gene  are the minimum necessary to get statistical power to check the null hypothesis of even distribution of sequences among the three libraries. ninety six genes presented four or more sequences in our libraries. however, taking into account the large number of tests performed, we decided to use a more conservative set of genes  to avoid type i errors. this new set comprised  <dig> genes, whose distribution among libraries is shown in additional file  <dig> together with their probability of departure from the null hypothesis using a chi-square test. to use all information available and to get higher statistical power, we decided to perform an additional analysis by comparing the profiles of all genes grouped according to go categories . though this approach could be mixing genes with opposite expression patterns, it could provide significant trends associated to specific functions for complementing the "individual-level gene" analysis. bonferroni correction for multiple tests was considered in this case, because of the higher statistical power achieved with this approach.

as expected, defence/immune-related genes appeared overrepresented in the set of  <dig> genes  with regard to the total number of annotated genes in our libraries . some genes apparently responded in a similar way to both pathogens, being down-  or up-regulated  regarding control. however, most genes responded to only one pathogen. the different infection profile of the pathogens used in this study, a bacterium  and a parasite , is expected to stimulate a specific set of genes in the host. so, protein biosynthesis was up-regulated in response to aeromonas salmonicida, as suggested the increased amount or ribosome-related and elongation factor proteins, and their correspondent go terms . also, a general down-regulation of genes involved in proteolytic activity in response to this bacterium  was observed, in turn correlated to the lower presence of peptidase and proteolysis go terms in this library. the possibility that a. salmonicida could be blocking these genes cannot be ruled out, since it would facilitate the infection process. additionally, it was noteworthy that several iron metabolism-related genes turned out to be up-regulated after infection with a. salmonicida . the high relevance of iron for bacteria infection could explain this observation. the up-regulation of hepcidin after bacteria infection has been recently described in turbot and gilthead seabream  <cit> . finally, some other immune relevant genes like mhc ii alpha and beta antigens, complement c <dig>  thrombin, chemotaxin, bactericidal permeability-increasing protein, apolipoprotein a-iv <dig>  heat shock protein  <dig> beta and chemotaxin showed significant up-regulation in response to a. salmonicida.

however, the strongest genetic signature was observed in response to p. dicentrarchi infection. specific genes were exclusively detected in this library and sometimes at high frequencies, like those homologous to oryzias latipes and paralichthys olivaceous cdna clones and to mitochondrial atp synthase alpha-subunit gene. functional annotation of these unknown genes now appears relevant to understand the response of turbot to this pathogen. the same was reflected when go categories were analyzed . a large number of differentially regulated gene categories  appeared associated to p. dicentrarchi library according to the different go criteria. cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis, as well as carbohydrate metabolic process appeared up-regulated categories among biological processes. transporter and hydrolase activities, as well as protein, ion and heme binding also were overexpressed regarding molecular function classification. finally, cytoskeleton and cytosol appeared as the highest active cellular components. looking at specific categories, a significant increase in the expression of antioxidant genes, like glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-s-transferase, was observed. these genes play a pivotal role to prevent cellular damage due to the increased reactive oxygen species  during infection  <cit> . paramá et al.  <cit>  have recently demonstrated the increase in intracellular ros by proteases of turbot kidney in response to this pathogen. tissue trauma or invasion by pathogens induces changes in the quantities of several macromolecules in animal body fluids, which comprise one aspect of the acute phase response . in fish, apr proteins include pentraxins, serum amyloid p, several components of the complement system, transferrin and thrombin. up-regulation of pentraxin and serotransferrin was observed in response to p. dicentrarchi in our study. transferrin up-regulation could be related to the increase in inflammation and enhanced oxidative stress typical of infections with this parasite  <cit> . finally, up-regulation of other important components of the immune response such the profilin and lysozyme was observed. profilin-like protein has been reported as a toll-like receptor   <dig> ligand in some parasites  <cit> . tlrs are evolutionary conserved transmembrane proteins that recognize a unique pattern of molecules derived from pathogens or damaged cells, triggering robust but defined innate immune responses  <cit> .

markers-containing ests
est studies can also provide resources for the identification of polymorphic dna markers such as microsatellites and snps. in our study, screening of est sequences for short tandem repeats  identified  <dig> microsatellites using a conservative criterion . of these,  <dig> had significant hits in blast with e-value cut off ≤ 1e- <dig> and  <dig> were annotated. most microsatellites were dinucleotide  and trinucleotide , while only  <dig> tetranucleotide and  <dig> pentanucleotide were found. among these  <dig> ests sequences,  <dig> contained sufficient flanking sequences length for primer design. fifty of these  <dig> microsatellites-containing ests were contigs, therefore the in silico comparison of the sequences included in these contigs allowed us to identify  <dig> putative polymorphic microsatellites.

because of their abundance within the genome, snps are the most common type of genetic markers  <cit>  for studying complex genetic traits and genome evolution  <cit> . in turbot there have no been reports on snp identification so far. the use of non-normalized libraries and a large number of individuals in library construction made possible the identification of  <dig> good quality snps. after the three filters used in the qualitysnp pipeline  <cit> , we finally detected  <dig> real and  <dig> true snps , representing a rate of  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps per  <dig> bp, respectively. real and true snps included  <dig> and  <dig> transitions,  <dig> and  <dig> transversions and  <dig> and  <dig> indels, respectively. with this pipeline, only clusters with at least  <dig> est sequences were selected to minimize the detection of snps caused by sequencing errors. as shown in table  <dig> the majority of snps were detected in contigs involving a larger number of sequences, which provides an additional proof of our snp quality. the identification of microsatellite and snps markers within turbot ests will contribute to extend the turbot genetic map  <cit>  after linkage analysis in reference families. since these markers are linked to genes, they will be useful as type i markers for population genomics scanning in this species and for comparative mapping and fish evolutionary studies.

real snps are those which passed quality filters  <dig> and  <dig> using the pipeline qualitysnp and true snps are the highest quality snps passing the three filters .

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first report on a large transcriptional analysis in turbot providing new genomic resources in this important european aquaculture species. this study describes a collection of  <dig> ests representing  <dig> unique sequences obtained from three directionally cloned cdna libraries from s. maximus, all of these being novel ests for this species. therefore, this is a valuable est collection, which increases genomic resources of turbot and enhances the genomic tools available for non-model fish species. the transcript profile comparison among the three libraries allowed the identification of putative genes generally or specifically related with infections in turbot. in addition, a high number of putative microsatellite and snp est-markers are now available for turbot map and highly useful for comparative mapping. these ests will be the basis for the development of a turbot microarray, focused on the characterization of the transcriptional response to pathogen exposure.
