BACKGROUND
lactobacillus plantarum is a gram-positive lactic acid bacterium  with a long tradition in food fermentation, and is therefore generally regarded as safe . this microbe is found in many ecological niches including naturally fermented food and decaying plant materials. furthermore, l. plantarum is a normal inhabitant of the human gastrointestinal  tract  <cit> . the complete genome sequence of l. plantarum wcfs <dig> has been determined  <cit> , and tools for genetic engineering are available  <cit> . l. plantarum is adapted to survive in the harsh conditions of the gi-tract, as has been illustrated by recent genome-wide gene expression studies of the response of the bacterium to  gi-tract conditions  <cit> . both the potential probiotic effects of l. plantarum and the high survival rate during the passage of the gi-tract make this bacterium a promising candidate as a vehicle for in situ delivery of therapeutically interesting proteins  <cit> . the general potential of lab as in situ delivery vehicles for biomolecules is well recognized. for example, a recent phase i trial study has indicated that crohn's disease patients benefit from treatment with a genetically modified lactococcus lactis secreting human interleukin  <dig>  <cit> . promising results have been obtained with lab that secrete or anchor antigens to the cell .

bacteria use several pathways for protein export to the membrane, the cell wall or the medium  <cit> . many proteins follow the sec-dependent pathway and are synthesized as precursors with an n-terminal signal peptide that directs the protein to the sec translocation machinery. in the case of sec-dependent secreted proteins, the signal peptide is cleaved off during or shortly after the translocation  <cit> . the genome of l. plantarum wcfs <dig> codes for more than  <dig> proteins that contain an n-terminal signal peptide. about  <dig> of these proteins contain a potential signal peptidase i cleavage site, and are thus likely to be secreted to the culture medium or anchored to the cell wall  <cit> . for the large majority of the proteins whose secretion is directed by these signal peptides experimental data showing functional properties are lacking. using bioinformatics, some of the proteins were predicted to be enzymes or to be involved in adherence to host components  <cit> .

the possibility to secrete heterologous proteins in l. plantarum or other lab has been addressed in several studies  <cit> . so far, engineered secretion in l. plantarum has mostly been based on the use of heterologous signal peptides. the most widely exploited heterologous signal peptides are those from the l. lactis usp <dig> protein  <cit> , the streptococcus pyogenes m <dig> protein  <cit> , and the l. brevis s-layer protein  <cit> , as well as signal peptides from different microbial amylases  <cit> . when aiming for the construction of genetically engineered l. plantarum strains for human consumption, there is a need for the use of homologous signal peptides since this limits the use of foreign dna and since homologous signal peptides may lead to more efficient secretion. one key problem in selecting suitable signal peptides is the difficulty in predicting their efficiency on the basis of their sequence only .

in this study we present the first genome-wide experimental analysis of the functionality of sps from lactic acid bacteria. we have conducted a functional analysis of  <dig> of the  <dig> signal peptides from l. plantarum wcfs <dig> that were predicted by kleerebezem et al.  <cit>  to be processed by signal peptidase i. seventeen of the  <dig> sps were discarded from the study, primarily because the prediction of the cleavage site was ambiguous. to study the functionality of the signal peptides, they were used to direct secretion of a nuclease  from staphylococcus aureus and, for a subset, an amylase  from lactobacillus amylovorus. this screening revealed large variation in signal peptide functionality and led to identification of some homologous signal peptides that yielded high secretion levels in l. plantarum. although we generally found little correlation between signal peptide sequence properties and secretion results, our genome-wide data do suggest some criteria that may be used to increase the likelihood of selecting signal peptides  that yield efficient secretion of heterologous proteins.

RESULTS
library construction
kleerebezem et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> proteins with putative signal peptidase i cleavage sites in the genome of l. plantarum wcfs <dig>  in this study we ran all the  <dig> protein sequences through the web-based signalp  <dig>  program, using both the neural network  and hidden markov model  algorithms to predict putative cleavage sites  <cit> . the two algorithms yielded the same conclusions for  <dig> sps and these were selected for further studies. two of the  <dig> sequences were omitted from the sp library, one  because it's coding dna contains a sali site and one because of cloning problems . an overview of the  <dig> remaining sps and two additional heterologous sps  included in the library is presented in additional file  <dig> 

the length of the selected sps varies from  <dig>  to  <dig>  residues. the large majority of the sps  had lengths between  <dig> and  <dig> residues, and only one sequence was predicted to be longer than  <dig> residues . analyses of bacterial sps have shown predominance for alanine at positions - <dig>  - <dig> and + <dig> relative to the cleavage site  <cit> . seventeen of the  <dig> selected sequences have the consensus ala-x-ala↓ala cleavage site, whereas  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the sps contain an ala in the - <dig>  - <dig> and + <dig> positions, respectively. at position - <dig>   <dig> different residues are present, both small non-polar, polar and charged. the most dominant residue at the - <dig> position is glutamine which is present in  <dig> of the sequences. those sps that do not have ala in - <dig> have small, non-polar residues at this position. in the + <dig> position ala is most often replaced by asp . weblogos  <cit>  for the predicted cleavage sites of all  <dig> sps and some subgroups of sps are presented in additional file  <dig> 

the sp library was constructed by fusing sps translationally to the start codon of the sppa gene downstream of its native inducible psppa promoter using an ndei restriction site, as described in methods. at the c-terminal end of the sps, two amino acids downstream of the predicted cleavage site were retained from the original protein. because the sps were fused to the nuca reporter protein by a  <dig> nucleotide linker creating a unique sali restriction site, every construct had a valine followed by an aspartic acid residue in positions + <dig> and + <dig> relative to the cleavage site. the staphylococcal nuca was selected as a reporter protein because of its stability, small size, easily measurable extracellular activity and because it has previously been successfully used as a reporter protein for secretion in lactic acid bacteria  <cit> .

secretion capacity of the sp library
to measure the secretion capacity of the sps in the library, induced cells were harvested at od <dig> ~ <dig>   and nuclease activity was measured in cell free supernatants. figure  <dig> shows that there is large variation in the secretion capacity among the sps. for  <dig> of the sps extracellular nuclease activity was not significantly higher than the activity found for the construct with no signal peptide . the other constructs yielded a continuum of activity levels spanning from close to  <dig>  u/ml od <dig> to the almost 1800-fold higher value of  <dig>  u/ml od <dig> obtained for the best signal peptide, lp_ <dig>  we also compared the secretion capacity of the sps in the library to the secretion capacity of commonly used heterologous sps derived from the usp <dig>  and the m <dig>  proteins. both heterologous sps yielded secretion of nuca and the sp from m <dig> was among the better performing sps .

to check whether the variation in apparent secretion capacities was caused by differing transcription levels, we determined transcript levels in cultures from a subset of the cloned constructs using real-time pcr analyses. the results, depicted in figure  <dig>  show that there were no significant differences in transcript levels.

nuca secretion efficiency of selected sps in l. plantarum
to investigate secretion efficiencies , comparable amounts of cell and supernatant fractions were analyzed by western blot experiments using a polyclonal antiserum against nuca. we selected eight sp constructs from the library covering a wide range of secretion capacities . processed nuca could be detected in the supernatant of all selected clones , but not in the supernatant fraction of the control l. plantarum harboring the pnuc-cyt construct lacking a signal peptide. both the fact that processing occurred and the lack of extracellular nuca in the pnuc-cyt control show that extracellular nuca detected in the transformants is not due to cell lysis. the amount of nuca detected in the supernatants by western blotting generally corresponded well with the measured extracellular nuca activities shown in figure  <dig> 

secretion of l. amylovorus α-amylase 
in order to test the sps' general usefulness to direct secretion, the six sps leading to highest nuca secretion were also used to direct secretion of the  <dig> kda n-terminal fragment of the α-amylase  from l. amylovorus nrrl b- <dig>  <cit> . for comparison, two additional sps that led to lower extracellular nuca levels  were included. the performance of the new constructs was analyzed by activity measurements  and sds-page . all sp-containing constructs led to extracellular amylase activity but secretion efficiencies were well below 100% in all cases. the latter contrasts with the observations made for nuca, where secretion efficiencies for the better constructs approached 100% . the total amya activity  varied greatly among the constructs and generally the constructs yielding highest total activity displayed the lowest secretion efficiency. in line with previous observations  <cit> , table  <dig> shows that there generally is little correlation between the performance of an sp in nuca secretion and its performance in amya secretion. the trend in the data in table  <dig> seems to be that sps leading to intermediate secretion levels of nuca are among the best performers for amya, both with respect to the total level of extracellular activity and secretion efficiency.

a plasmids encoding sps are ranked according to their capacity to secrete nuca, as shown in figure  <dig> . all results are the mean value of three biological replicates.

b data from mathiesen et al  <cit> . note that the selection of sps in this previous study was more or less random and not based on the genome-wide overview of sp functionality that is presented here.

c based on the assumption that all intracellular, non-processed amya is equally active as secreted amya.

d apparent secretion is partly due to cell lysis, meaning that the secretion efficiency could not be calculated. see text for details.

using silver stained sds-page gels , the secreted amylase could be detected in non-concentrated culture media and the relative intensities of the bands correlated well with the relative levels of enzyme activities. in the case of the plp_2940samy construct, which leads to high total amylase levels, cell lysis was observed. scanning electron microscopy showed that induced plp_2940samy containing cells had an elongated shape that differed drastically from the shape of non-induced plp_2940samy containing cells and induced cells containing other secretion constructs such as plp_0297samy .

correlations between sp properties and secretion capacity for nuca
to search for a connection between sp sequence properties and secretion capacity, we carried out a series of calculations based on the sp sequences and compared the results with the nuca activity data. tables  <dig> and  <dig> present the results of two types of group-wise analyses. in one analysis, the ten best performing sps  were compared with sps without significant extracellular activity . in the other analysis, the best performing half of the sps  was compared with the least performing half . for each group mean values for the different properties were calculated and these values were then compared. for some of these analyses the sps were divided into domains  <cit> . the n-domain was defined to span from the n-terminal methionine to the last positively charged residue in the n-terminal part of the sp, and had an average length of  <dig>  residues. the rest of the sp is referred to as h+c domain, consisting of the hydrophobic h-region following the n-domain, followed by the c-domain that ends at the predicted cleavage site for the signal peptidase.

aaverage values for different properties were calculated for sps grouped by nuca activity.

bsubgroups of the  <dig> sps were made as indicated, with sps being numbered by their ability to produce extracellular nuca activity, with sp number  <dig> having the highest activity; see text for further details.

c the hydrophobicity of the sps was estimated using the protscale program  <cit>  using the kyte & doolittle scale  <cit>  on the expasy server . the numbers indicate the maximum hydrophobicity value, using a sliding window size of seven.

d see text for definition of the domains. nb. we verified that the length of the h+c domain is not correlated to the maximum hydrophobicity defined in footnote c .

comparing the groups did not yield significant correlations between measured extracellular nuca activities and the following sp properties: isoelectric point of the complete sp, length of the sp, net charge or length of the n-domain, net charge/length of the n-domain, and the d-value provided by signalp . however, the data showed that measured nuca activities were significantly  correlated to sp properties as follows:  a positive correlation with sp hydrophobicity, found in both comparisons ;  a positive correlation with the length of the h+c domain. a control analysis using only sps that gave significant extracellular activity  yielded the same correlations .

analysis of the sequence of the cleavage sites did not show any clear trends. in fact, the data did not suggest that the presence of the consensus sequence ala-x-ala↓ala is particularly favourable. both the a-x-a motif in front of the cleavage site and the a at position + <dig> were more abundant in the least performing half of the sps. only six of the  <dig> best performing sps had the a-x-a↓a consensus sequence.

previous studies have shown that sps adopt α-helical conformations in interfacial environments such as cell membranes  <cit> . all  <dig> sps as well as m <dig> and usp <dig> were run through a web-based transmembrane helical prediction program, tmhmm server v.  <dig>   <cit> . the prediction showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> sps were predicted to adopt a transmembrane helix  structure. interestingly, 97% of the  <dig> best performing sps were predicted to contain a tmh, while this was the case for only 62% of the  <dig> worst performing sps . the observed secretion capacities showed no correlation with the length of the predicted tmh nor with the position of the predicted helix start . tmhmm also predicts the presence of sps. nine of the  <dig> sps were not recognized as sps by tmhmm and eight of these were all in the least performing half of the  <dig> tested sps .

interestingly, there also seems to be a weak correlation between the ability of an sp to drive secretion of nuca and the presence of motifs that keep the original cognate protein attached to the cell surface . of the  <dig> proteins in the library harbouring one of these motifs, most have sps that led to low secretion capacity for nuca . 64% of the proteins belonging to the  <dig> worst performing sps were predicted to contain a cell-wall anchoring motif, while this was the case for only 41% of the  <dig> proteins with the best performing sps .

discussion
we present a comprehensive study of putative sps in the genome of l. plantarum wcfs <dig> for which signalp predicted a unique cleavage site for signal peptidase i. the results provide genome-wide insight into sp functionality, new tools  for secretion of proteins using homologous sps, and increased insight into the predictability of sp functionality on the basis of sequence only.

82%  of the  <dig> tested sps led to secretion of nuca. while this result may be taken to confirm that the  <dig> l. plantarum proteins containing these sps indeed are secreted, it does not imply that the remaining  <dig> sps do not function at all and that their cognate proteins are not secreted. sp functionality depends on which protein is being secreted  <cit> , meaning that sps that do not work for nuca may function when coupled to another protein . furthermore, in some cases prediction of the signal peptidase cleavage site may have been wrong, despite the unanimous prediction by the two signal p algorithms . indeed, comparison of the sequences of some of the seemingly non-functional sps  with what is known about cleavage site sequences  show that alternative cleavage sites are possible in some of these sps. the detected levels of extracellular nuca varied by three orders of magnitude. since the only difference between the constructs is the sp, the large differences in secretion capacity are due to variation in the sp, directly or indirectly. to try to unravel the causes of these variations we set up additional experiments and looked closer into the properties of the sps.

real-time pcr studies of cultures containing different constructs did not reveal significant differences in mrna levels. this indicates that the large variation in secretion capacity observed for these constructs is not due to differences in transcription levels. this is an expected result, since the constructs contain identical transcription initiation and termination signals. thus, the variation in secretion capacities must be governed by  post-transcriptional factors such as secondary structure of mrna, codon usage and translation efficiency, the interaction between the precursor protein and the translocation machinery, the efficiency of the signal peptidase for the sp in question, the rate of  intracellular and  extracellular folding, and possible interactions between the secreted protein and the bacterial cell wall  <cit> .

although the western blot of figure  <dig> provides only limited quantitative insight, the data do suggest that all l. plantarum transformants produced approximately equal amounts of nuca, meaning that all transformants experienced approximately equal "protein loads". the data show a  correlation between translocation efficiency and the levels of secreted protein . one possible cause of variation in secretion efficiency is variation in the efficiency of sp processing. however, in their genome-wide study of b. subtilis sps brockmeier et al.  <cit>  showed that the rate of precursor processing had limited effects on levels of extracellular reporter protein. assuming a similar situation in l. plantarum, differences in the efficiency of the translocation process itself remain as the main cause of the variation in extracellular nuca levels.

mutagenesis studies have confirmed that secretion levels in gram-positive bacteria are not only affected by variation in the sps  <cit>  but also by variation in the n-terminal part of the mature protein  <cit> . le loir et al.  <cit>  showed that negative charge in the n-terminal part of the secreted protein was beneficial for secretion. the nuca variants in the present study varied only with respect to residues + <dig> and + <dig> and we did not observe correlations between the character of these residues and secretion performance of the sp. the very efficient lp_ <dig> sequence has a basic residue  at position + <dig> which is unexpected on the basis of the conclusions drawn by le loir et al.  <cit> . taking into account the above considerations, it is likely that the variation in the secretion of nuca observed in this study is caused by the variation of the sp only and its effect on the interaction between the precursor and the translocation machinery.

the translocation process is a complex process which involves many interactions that are affected by the characteristics of both the sp and the protein. it is conceivable, that sps are evolutionary adapted to their cognate protein to ensure efficient and controlled secretion. the importance of the protein part is clearly shown in both the present study and a previous genome-wide study on sps from b. subtilis  <cit> , which show that the efficiency of many sps depends on the reporter protein. thus, high secretion efficiency requires an optimal combination between the sp and the target protein. recent studies suggest that sp function may be much more complex than previously thought, and may direct surface proteins to different subcellular locations  <cit> . clearly, such underlying complexities in sp functionality, will weaken correlations between sp sequence properties and secretion levels.

several studies have shown that changes in hydrophobicity of the h-domain can affect the secretion capacity  <cit>  and this is indeed one of the correlations that we discovered in the present genome-wide study. however, in a study of  <dig> sps from b. subtilis  <cit>  no such correlation was found. in the present study, we also identified a clear correlation between a predicted transmembrane helix by the programme tmhmm and high secretion capacity. on the basis of our results, running tmhmm seems one of the best ways to select sps that are likely to perform well, and this analysis should thus be performed next to signalp. in addition, the length of the h+c domain should also be taken into account when selecting an sp. it is interesting to note that sps from proteins that are thought to be anchored to the cell wall tend to perform less well than other sps. it is conceivable that these proteins do not require high translocation efficiencies, since they are not meant to be actively secreted to the surrounding media and therefore may be produced at lower levels than released proteins.

in this study, we have based the prediction of signal peptides on the original analysis of the l. plantarum genome as described by kleerebezem et al  <cit>  and we have used signalp  <dig>  to check and predict the cleavage sites. clearly, the annotation of the l. plantarum genome will evolve as bioinformatic tools evolve and today's annotation, e.g. with respect to the subcellular localization of proteins, will differ from the one published in  <dig>  the most accurate prediction of extracellular protein localization in l. plantarum wcfs <dig> is found in the secretome database  <cit> . another prediction tool is the newly developed locate p  <cit>  that combines existing predictors and produces genome-wide predictions for the subcellular locations of bacterial proteins in a fully automated manner. predictions based on both methods/databases for the  <dig> proteins relevant for this study are included in additional file  <dig> and show several differences. for example, all but one  of the selected sps are predicted to be cleaved by spasei in the secretome database, whereas locate p predicts such cleavage only for  <dig> of the sps. the present set with experimental data may be used to evaluate prediction quality and, hopefully, to improve prediction methods. our data show that the sps of several proteins predicted to be n-terminally anchored by locatep lead to efficient secretion of nuca, meaning that they are cleaved by spasei as predicted by signalp and according to the prediction in the secretome database. likewise, several proteins predicted to be multi-membrane proteins according to locate p contain sps that are quite efficient for nuca secretion.

to test the general performance of the sps we replaced nuca with amya in selected constructs. when produced at levels applied in this study, amya seems to be difficult to handle for l. plantarum. secretion efficiencies were below, often far below, 100% for all constructs. table  <dig> shows that the amya constructs lead to highly variable overall production levels, creating a complicating variable that was less prominent in the studies with nuca. previous studies have shown that overexpressed amylase can be difficult to handle for b. subtilis and induce stress reactions  <cit> . table  <dig> also shows that high production levels of amya correlate with low secretion efficiencies, suggesting that the translocation machinery is overloaded. in addition to slow or blocked translocation, secretion stress may cause intracellular or extracellular proteolytic degradation  <cit> . proteolytic degradation was not analyzed because of the lack of a suitable antibody for amya. the stress caused by amya expression is illustrated by cells harbouring the plp_2940samy construct that leads to high levels of amya production. these cells showed impaired growth , cell lysis and a change in morphology . lp_ <dig> did not perform very well for nuca  and it does not have the properties that are typical for sps that work well with nuca . it is possible that the combination of a high production level with an unfavourable sp stressed the cells to the extent that lysis occurred. all in all, our observations with amya indicate that this protein is not a suitable reporter to search for characteristics in sp-sequences that correlate to secretion capacity.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study shows that at least 82% of the tested putative signal peptidase i-dependent sps in the genome of l. plantarum wcfs <dig> indeed functions as a signal for secretion. the results reveal considerable variation in sp performance that is at least in part dependent on the protein that is secreted. we identified correlations between sp sequence and sp performance which may be used for pre-selecting promising sps, but the general conclusion is that prediction of sp performance is difficult. the lack of predictability suggests that sequence differences between sps at least in part relate to other  aspects of sp functionality, such as spatial and temporal regulation of protein production and secretion. as it stands, secreting a protein of interest at the highest possible levels in l. plantarum will require experimental screening of sps. the library constructed in this study provides an easy to use tool for rapid experimental screening since it is based on exchangeable cassettes.
