BACKGROUND
the transcription of genes is considered to be primarily regulated by transcription factors . tfs are recruited to interact with specific dna sequences or motifs in promoters. it is an important and challenging issue to characterize these promoter motifs. it was shown that some motifs  are most commonly found within - <dig> to + <dig> bp of the transcription start site   <cit> . in other words, positional distribution plots of single motifs found in many promoters show a single peak in frequency near the tss  <cit> . in the promoters of higher eukaryotes, such as humans, multiple tfs act in a coordinated way to enable complex patterns of gene expression; thus, it is highly likely that even those binding sites of tfs that do not show clear positional preferences are placed under some constraints, showing a bias such as a frequency peak at a certain distance from the tss when the co-occurrences of a motif pair are considered. to date, no study has examined the positional relationships among motif pairs and tss. furthermore, the search for motifs is usually limited to the  <dig> kb of sequence immediately upstream of a tss; however, more than  <dig> kb of upstream sequence is commonly conserved among vertebrates. a previous study has reported a diverse range of different tsss for the same genes  <cit> , and distal-promoters are also important for gene expression  <cit> . therefore, >  <dig> kb of sequence should be examined for motif pairs.

in higher eukaryotes, tf binding sites are often organized in clusters called cis-regulatory modules   <cit> . most of the computational crm prediction algorithms developed to date rely mainly on the distances between motifs and the phylogenetic conservation of these motifs across different species  <cit> . for example, blanchette et al. recently performed a genome-wide prediction of crms in the human genome  <cit> ; however, further analyses are required to clarify the nature of different motifs, such as which motif pairs are preferentially used in promoters. yu et al.  <cit>  addressed this issue by identifying motif pairs with biased distance distributions in various sets of human genes that exhibited tissue-specific expression, and long et al.  <cit>  identified motif pairs over-represented in promoters of immune-response genes. it also appears to be important to gain an understanding of the function of upstream sequences that are not specific to differentially expressed genes. such overall analyses may reveal the specific features of  house-keeping genes.

we are currently engaged in the construction of two databases  that contain information on tsss determined by the mapping of cdnas with intact 5'-ends onto genome sequences. h-invdb covers a wide range of genes, but the tss information is expected to be more accurate in dbtss. this wealth of data should be useful in obtaining further insights into motif positioning relative to tsss.

in this study, we developed a method of identifying positional relationships among motif pairs and tsss in human promoters. we searched from - <dig> to + <dig> bp relative to each tss, enabling an examination of possible alternative promoters  <cit>  or distant motifs in enhancers and silencers. we first visualized the positional preferences among pairs of non-overlapping motifs and the representative tss for each gene. this visualization assisted in the identification of two distinct classes of motif pairs in terms of the positional relationships between the pairs and tsss. differences between these two classes were examined with regard to the positional distributions of their constituent motifs, the expression patterns of the genes that harbor the motif pairs, and the protein domains relevant to the transcription factors that bind to the promoter motifs.

RESULTS
identification and visualization of co-occurring motif pairs with positional correlation
we predicted the dna motifs, or putative transcription factor binding sites, in the sequence from - <dig> to + <dig> bp relative to the tsss of human genes using  <dig> weight matrices in the transfac database. for convenience, we refer to these as 'promoter sequences'. the weight matrices were clustered such that each cluster of weight matrices can be regarded as non-redundant . to reduce the number of false positives , we discarded motifs predicted on repetitive sequences such as alu and those predicted outside of phylogenetically conserved regions. the remaining putative sites were used for analyses of their co-occurrence. to avoid counts based on overlapping binding motifs, overlapping pairs were not considered. the chi-square test was used to identify motif pairs that co-occur with significant positional correlation; i.e., pairs for which the bias of the co-occurrence is not explained by the independent occurrence of each motif. the motifs were analyzed using kolmogorov-smirnov test  to assess the significance of their distance distributions relative to those of randomly generated sequences. a criterion of 1% false discovery rate  was applied to both the chi-square test and the k-s test. motif pairs that satisfied the two tests were considered to be significant.

among the  <dig>  motif pair combinations,  <dig>   and  <dig>   were identified as being significant in terms of the promoters from h-invdb and dbtss, respectively. all of the significant motif pairs are listed in additional file  <dig>  to examine the patterns of their positional biases, we visualized the co-occurrences of motif pairs in three ways. first, we compiled a heat map of the raw counts of each motif pair along the promoter regions . second, we plotted another heat map showing the negative logarithm of p-values for the significance of the bias, calculated assuming a hypergeometric distribution for each region-pair . in other words, this plot shows the degree to which the co-occurrence is enhanced at a region-pair compared with an independent occurrence at the same bin. third, we plotted the positional distribution of each motif on each promoter . using this approach, we visualized the biased occurrences of both paired and single motifs. this analysis revealed a number of common patterns that have interesting biological implications.

comparison of the detected motif pairs and known data
for the significant motif pairs, we examined the 'detection ratio', which is the ratio of the number of detected and known motif pairs to the number of known motif pairs, using the transcompel database  and the transfac database. since the definition of identical motifs  in transcompel database is different from ours , the correspondence of neither the motifs nor the motif pairs is 1-to- <dig>  of the  <dig>  significant motif pairs,  <dig> were successfully mapped to  <dig> of the  <dig> pairs in transcompel. thus, the detection ratio of transcompel was 69% .

classification of motif pairs based on positional patterns
visualization of the two types of heat maps shown in figure 1a and 1b enabled the identification of several characteristic groups. to objectively analyze the data from these heat maps, we defined a set of criteria to use in classifying motif pairs into three groups; a flow chart of this process is shown in figure  <dig>  briefly, in the class  <dig> pairs, co-occurrences are found mainly in the vicinity of tsss  in both types of heat maps. in the class  <dig> pairs, co-occurrence was not particularly biased around tsss, but was biased when the relative distances of co-occurring positions were within  <dig> bp in both heat maps. those motif pairs not classified as class  <dig> or  <dig> were assigned to class  <dig>  which contains miscellaneous bias patterns. we emphasize that this classification of motif pairs is based solely on plots of raw counts  and the hypergeometric test : it does not take into account the positional distribution of single motifs .

the numbers of motif pairs classified into classes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. figure  <dig> shows typical examples of class  <dig> and class  <dig> pairs. as noted above, class  <dig> pairs occur over a wide range  relative to the positions of tsss. in most cases, these motif pairs were located within  <dig> bp of the tsss, which is the unit length of our digitization  .

types of motif peaks in terms of the positional distributions of single motifs
in some cases, the positional distribution of a single motif exhibits a peak around the tss ; thus, we characterized the above co-occurrence patterns  in terms of the positional distributions of their constituent single motifs. based on the signal/noise ratio of the positional distribution, we detected peaks within - <dig> to + <dig> of tsss . similar peak-detection methods, employing standard deviation, have been used in previous studies  <cit> . each single motif was assigned into one of four peak types: 'large peak ', 'small peak ', 'no peak ', and 'no data '. among the  <dig> independent motifs , we classified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> into types lp, sp, np, and nd, respectively.

we examined the relationship between the co-occurrence of motif pairs and the type of peak of their constituent motifs based on the rank of p-values calculated for the significance of motif pairs, as assessed using the chi-square test . for every group of  <dig> pairs , the content of each peak was counted and its ratio compared with its expected count. we were unable to rank the top  <dig> pairs because their p-values were close to zero; consequently, the values of the top  <dig> pairs were plotted as the first group . it is evident from figure  <dig> that the np motif type is strongly preferred in higher ranks of motif pairs: the lp and sp types tend to be avoided.

next, we considered the relationship between the different peak types and the classes of motif pairs. table  <dig> lists the  <dig> motifs that are most frequently used in the motif pairs in each class. these motifs  can be regarded as the 'hubs' in the network. for convenience, we refer to the top  <dig> motifs as hub-motifs . a log-log plot  reveals that the degree  in class  <dig> decreases linearly as the rank number increases, while that in class  <dig> decreases rapidly. this finding suggests that the connectivity of the two classes is intrinsically different.

the actual number of motifs exceeds  <dig> because of tied ranks. the identifiers in transfac are shown as the names of the motifs. the 'pt' column shows the peak type of each motif .

interestingly, most of the peaks in class  <dig> were lp , whereas those in class  <dig> were mainly np. this indicates that many of the constituent motifs in the class  <dig> pairs occur around tsss; however, the predominance of lp-type peaks in class  <dig> is not the result of an independent preference for localization near tsss: instead, it reflects cooperation between pairs. this interpretation is supported by the significant peaks in the p-value heat map . another interesting observation is that the hub motifs in the two classes define almost completely disjoined sets . in contrast, if we compare all of the motifs  that appear in the two classes, they show significant overlap. there are very few motifs specific to class  <dig> .

promoters that contain class  <dig> motif pairs prefer ubiquitous expression
it is of interest to test for differences between the expression of genes that posses the two classes of motif pairs. to this end, we used the unigene database  <cit>  in assessing the tissue-specific/ubiquitous expression of genes. as exemplified in the work by yamashita et al.  <cit> , the number of unique est  libraries in which expression of a gene is observed as at least one est sequence can be used as a convenient measure of anti-tissue specificity. to examine gene expression, we prepared a gene set putatively regulated by the motif pairs in each class. as each promoter often contains multiple motif pairs from multiple classes, it is not simple to connect each class to either gene or gene expression. here we collected genes whose promoters contain only motif pairs in the same class . each group contained  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> promoters for each class. figure  <dig> shows the distribution of the number of different est libraries for each class. the mean numbers of different libraries for classes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. the p-value on the null hypothesis that there is no difference between class  <dig> and class  <dig>  was lower than  <dig> e- <dig>  by the wilcoxon test. we also calculated correlation coefficients between the number of motif pairs in each class and expression measure  using all genes. they were  <dig> , - <dig> ,  <dig>  for each class. it seems evident that those genes that possess class  <dig> motif pairs on their promoter regions are more likely to be expressed ubiquitously than those that possess other classes of motif pairs.

relationships between the class of motif pairs and cpg richness of promoters
we considered the relationship between the classes of motif pairs and the cpg richness of related promoters. we calculated cpg ratio in the non-repeat sequences of promoters as an index of cpg richness. the number of cpg in all the regions, including repeat sequences , gave similar results. the correlation coefficient between the number of motif pairs from each class and the cpg ratio through all promoters were  <dig> , - <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. both positive and negative significant correlations were observed for class  <dig> and  <dig>  there were no significant correlation between the cpg ratio and class  <dig>  assuming that motif pairs in class  <dig> are more related to ubiquitous gene expression, the results of class  <dig> and  <dig> are consistent with the fact that about half of housekeeping genes have cpg islands covering the tss  <cit> .

protein domains characteristic of the hub-tfs
using the  <dig> most significant motif pairs, we constructed a network of motif pairing. a log-log plot  of the degrees-node distribution showed linearity, suggesting that the network obeys the power law, as is typical for protein-protein interaction networks  <cit> . as noted above, those tfs that correspond to the top  <dig> motifs in each class in table  <dig> are regarded as hubs in the network. to characterize these tfs, their domain structure was examined using the transfac database. of the  <dig> tfs linked to the  <dig> motif pairs,  <dig> possess  <dig> domains. among these domains, enriched domains with odds ratios above  <dig>  are listed in table  <dig> . the odds ratio indicates the degree to which the domain is enriched in the hub-tfs. the data in table  <dig> reveal that domains rich in certain amino acids  are enriched in class  <dig> hub-tfs and the entire set of significantly co-occurring pairs.

shown are the domain names, the frequency of the domains in the hub-tfs  for class  <dig>   <dig>  and all of co-occurring motif pairs. the domains are ordered by odds ratio.

discussion
we identified transfac motif pairs that significantly co-occur within human promoter regions. this procedure is dependent on the accuracy of the tss information. for tss annotation, we used two databases: h-invdb and dbtss. h-invdb contains more sequence data of transcripts that cover not only protein-coding mrnas but also pol ii-transcribed non-coding rnas. because the promoter sequences are more abundant in h-invdb, fewer false negatives are expected; it is therefore natural that a greater number of significant motif pairs were found in h-invdb than in dbtss. on the other hand, the advantage of using dbtss lies in the accuracy of its tss information. given that we confirmed that the co-occurrence patterns for motif pairs derived from both annotations were similar, we used h-invdb for down-stream analyses.

the detection ratio of significantly detected motif pairs was 69% , while we detected 32% of the total possible combination , which is a promising result considering the previous work by yu et al.  <cit> . its detection ratio  was 40%, detecting 19%  of  <dig>  combination using tissue specific gene groups. our detection ratio is higher than that of yu et al., mainly because we detected many pairs. related to the reason of our high detection ratio, the substantial difference is that we use all genes transcribed by rna pol ii including widely expressed  genes, while they only use tissue specific genes. other differences include the evaluation model, source of known interactions , and clustering of motifs. for the evaluation model, we evaluated motif pairs with two statistical tests:  chi-square test for biases of their relative positions from tss and  k-s test for their distance distribution biases. yu et al. evaluated motif pairs from two viewpoints:  over-representation of motif pairs and  distance distribution biases, which we adopted as the second test. thus, their model does not consider the distance between the motif and tss. they evaluated a p-value as the product of the two p-values calculated from the above viewpoints. for the thresholds, we used an fdr of 1% for each test, though 1%, 5%, and 10% are conventionally used  <cit> . yu et al. set the threshold to be 10- <dig>  after the multiple testing correction. if we calculate the product of the p-values corresponding to the two tests, their maximum value among the detected motif pairs was  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  in addition, if we employ the same threshold of 10- <dig> ,  <dig>  out of  <dig>  pairs were still significant. thus, our threshold of fdr is stringent enough.

a total of  <dig>  pairs were analyzed for their positional preference with respect to the tss position; consequently, two major classes were identified. the visualization of the bias of motif pairs in terms of the promoter  is a novel approach that enables the identification of class  <dig> pairs. in the hypergeometric statistical test shown in figure 1b, if the tested region lies only on the core promoter, it is the same as those used in several previous papers  <cit> . we extended the single region to wider set of regions for the evaluation of co-occurrences for motif pairs on divided promoter region pairs  to detect positional correlations. the approach taken in this regard – to plot a positional distribution for single motifs and to identify a peak  – is widely used in previous studies  <cit> . we then defined a set of criteria to employ in objectively assigning pairs to different classes . several features of these two classes of motif pairs were then examined, with the results being summarized in table  <dig> 

lp, sp, np are the different peak types for single motifs .

the class  <dig> motif pairs are localized near the tsss, and may represent components of core promoters  <cit> . these motif pairs mainly consist of lp and sp types of single motifs, which is notable for two reasons. first, in significantly co-occurring motif pairs, np types of single motifs are overrepresented . second, in the heat map that shows the significance of correlated co-occurrence , the overrepresentations of the co-occurrence of the motif pairs cannot be explained as a direct result of the independent occurrence of each motif around the tss. thus, it is possible that the tfs that bind to these motif pairs interact with each other.

the possibility that the class  <dig> motif pairs are largely related to constitutive or ubiquitous gene expression is indicated by the three following evidences:  the est analysis ,  the functions of the tfs that binds to the top  <dig> motifs that are most frequently used in the class  <dig> pairs, and  a recent work conducted by another group  <cit> . for example for the functions of the tfs, the transcription factor e2f regulates gene expression in the cell cycle; sp <dig>  maz, nfy, krox, sp <dig>  and cp <dig> are the tfs associated with ubiquitous transcription; and pax <dig>  is a member of the paired box  family of transcription factors, that has multiple roles during fetal development. as the third evidences, according to a recent study on alternative promoters  <cit> , single promoters that are cpg-rich and do not have alternative promoters are significantly associated with ubiquitous gene expression. it is likely that this category of promoters is mainly composed of our class  <dig> motif pairs.

the relative positions of motif pairs are much more flexible in class  <dig> than in class  <dig>  these pairs appear at least  <dig> kb away from the tss, yet most previous studies only examined  <dig> kb of sequence  <cit> . these class  <dig> motif pairs are mainly composed of np-type motifs, which are likely to cooperate with other motifs to be functional. in s. cerevisiae, yu et al.  <cit>  found  <dig> significant tf interactions , most of which were not constitutively active. this is consistent with our study of human promoters because the motifs related to constitutive gene expression are thought to be linked to class  <dig>  which is the minority of the detected motif pairs. moreover, the top  <dig> most frequent motifs in class  <dig>  appear to be involved in various functions. we show some examples of tf pairs, corresponding to detected motif pairs, that are known to function cooperatively. we detected a motif pair consisting of gata <dig> and ap <dig>  gata <dig> is thought to regulate genes involved in embryogenesis and in myocardial differentiation and function, and gata <dig> and ap <dig> cooperatively regulate transgenic mice overexpressing cardiac calsequestrin  <cit> . we have another motif pair consisting of gata <dig> and tbx <dig>  tbx <dig> plays a role in heart development and specification of limb identity together with gata <dig>  <cit> . one of our hub motifs myod pairs with several motifs known to be involved in muscle and heart gene regulation   <cit> . the motif pair nf-kappab and c/ebp was also detected, and it is known that these two motifs synergistically regulate the mouse serum amyloid a gene expression induced by inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . thus, the motif pairs in class  <dig> appear to be involved in various specific functions.

we observed that relative positions of motif pairs in class  <dig> ranged widely within the  <dig> kbp regions. it may be due to alternative promoters  <cit>  or the diversity of tsss  <cit> . kimura et al.  <cit>  showed that at least 52% of human genes have alternative promoter sequences separated by > <dig> bp. even with a much more strict threshold of  <dig> kb, 44%  were regarded to have alternative promoters . the other possible reason is that these motif pairs can work at any distance as components of enhancers . it is well accepted that the location of enhancers is rather arbitrary and that both promoters and enhancers share modular architecture  <cit> . thus, it seems likely that some promoters contain enhancer-like modules  and that these modules contain the class  <dig> motif pairs. in any case, the fact that the top  <dig> motifs in both classes do not overlap  supports the view that the two classes are distinct in terms of the way they function.

we selected a set of tfs that work as hubs in the tf-tf interaction network in each class. table  <dig> summarizes the overrepresented domains in these hubs. it seems that these domains are commonly characterized by an excess of a certain amino acid. this tendency is stronger in class 2-related tfs than class 1-related tfs. these biased domains, such as the proline-rich domain, may play common important roles in gene regulation. in fact, the sh <dig> and ww domains recognize proline-rich peptides. the binding of sh <dig> domains to proline-rich regions causes the formation of a large number of protein complexes  <cit> . most of the proteins that interact with sh <dig> domains contain at least one pxxp motif  <cit> . it was recently found that 49% of the entire sequence of human tfs contains intrinsically disordered  regions  <cit>  that differ from dna binding domains. using techniques such as nmr , it has been revealed that the trans-activation domains are unstructured in unbound tfs and become structured upon binding to their partners  <cit> . the id regions tend to consist of alanine, glutamic acid, glycine, lysine, proline, glutamine, arginine, and serine residues  <cit> . among these eight amino acids, five are overrepresented in table  <dig>  furthermore, haynes et al. reported that id regions are common to hub proteins from four eukaryotic interactomes   <cit> , indicating the importance of id regions in protein interactions. as an unstructured protein domain with repetitive sequence, the c-terminal domain  of rna polymerase ii is comprised of a variable number of tandem heptapeptide repeats. this feature is important in the efficient capping, splicing, and polyadenylation of mrna transcripts  <cit> . these previous studies lead us to a model in which repetitive domains have potential in terms of acquiring multiple functions through protein interaction. thus, it is likely that the domains commonly observed in hub-tfs  are related to id regions; this may play an important role in tf-tf interaction in transcription.

with the intention of identifying general features of promoter architecture, the present study examined a general set of genes rather than a set of co-regulated genes, as done in previous studies  <cit> . further studies that employ this approach will help to clarify these general features. a possible approach would be the identification of cis-regulatory modules  based on the detected motif pairs in this paper, as attempted in  <cit> . given that the unit length employed in the present study was  <dig> bp, a necessary future study would involve a more detailed analysis of the distances between significant motif pairs. we found that most of the motif pair distances are less than  <dig> bp, with few in the range of  <dig> bp. this finding is consistent with the observation that most of the cooperative motifs in the transcompel database  are within a distance of  <dig> bp. another necessary future task is a more detailed characterization of the remaining significant motif pairs that we tentatively termed class  <dig>  it seems certain that our visualization method, as well as our statistical tools, will be useful in obtaining further insights into promoter structures.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate the occurrence of at least two distinct classes of motif pairs in human promoters, with one class appearing around tsss and the other found at somewhat arbitrary distances from tsss. this trend is reminiscent of the well-known difference between promoters and enhancers . there has been some discussion that promoters and enhancers are alike in terms of their modular structure as clusters of tfbss  <cit> ; however, a recent study reported differences in terms of the pattern of histone modifications  <cit> . thus, our findings may reflect this kind of difference or merely differences between core promoters and crm-like modules of promoters; further investigations are necessary to clarify these hypotheses. our visualization method will also be useful in these types of future studies.
