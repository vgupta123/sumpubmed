BACKGROUND
homer is a scaffold protein that is targeted to the postsynaptic density  of excitatory synapses. there are three distinct members, homer <dig>  homer <dig> and homer <dig>  in this protein family  <cit>  . postsynaptic homer scaffolds interact with a variety of ppxxf  ligand motif-containing signaling molecules, including the type i metabotropic glutamate receptor subunits 1α and  <dig> , the inositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate receptor  and shank, via its n-terminal ena/vasp homology  <dig>  domain  <cit> , and forms a tetramer by self-assembly via its c-terminal coiled-coil  and leu zipper  motifs  <cit> . in cerebellar purkinje cells, the interaction of homer <dig> with mglur1α is regulated by activity-dependent phosphorylation at the linker region between the evh <dig> domain and the coiled-coil domain  <cit> . in hippocampal neurons, homer proteins co-cluster with the nmda receptor complex during dendritic and synaptic differentiation  <cit> , and regulate spine morphogenesis  <cit>  as well as the functional organization of mglur1α/5-insp3r ca2+ signaling in dendritic spines  <cit> .

dendritic spine morphology is dynamically changed in response to synaptic activity, which is associated with synaptic functions including the long-term maintenance of synaptic strengthening  <cit> . impaired spine morphology is known to contribute to mental retardations  <cit> . we previously showed that cupidin, identical to homer <dig>  is co-sedimented with filamentous actin  via the evh <dig> domain, and also interacts with the gtp-bound, activated form of cdc <dig> small gtpase via the c-terminal region  <cit> . interestingly, over-expression of cupidin/homer <dig> suppressed cdc42-induced formation of filopodia-like protrusions in hela cells  <cit> . moreover, cupidin/homer <dig> was partly colocalized with drebrin, a dendritic f-actin-binding protein, in the dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons  <cit>  and cerebellar granule cells  <cit> . it is known that both cdc <dig>  <cit>  and drebrin  <cit>  are involved in dendritic spine morphogenesis by regulating actin-cytoskeletal organization. a previous study showed that over-expression of homer1b together with shank induced enlargement of the spine heads of hippocampal neurons  <cit> . together, the results of these studies suggest that homer family proteins are involved in the regulation and/or plasticity of spine morphology by interacting with two dendritic f-actin regulators, cdc <dig> and drebrin. however, little is known about the molecular basis underpinning the involvement of homer proteins in actin cytoskeleton-based regulation of spine morphology.

in this study we analyzed the structural and functional properties of the cupidin/homer <dig> scaffolding that interacts with two dendritic spine f-actin organization modulators, cdc <dig> and drebrin. we defined the cdc42-binding domain in the c-terminal region of cupidin/homer <dig> and revealed the functional significance of cdc42-binding domain in spine and synapse formation by cultured hippocampal neurons, as well as in cdc42-induced filopodia-like protrusion formation in hela cells. we also proved drebrin to be a homer evh1-binding target and showed the effect of cdc42-binding domain on the drebrin accumulation in spines. these results strongly implicate the postsynaptic homer scaffolding in the morphogenesis of dendritic spines.

RESULTS
cupidin interacts with activated cdc <dig> via the c-terminal coiled-coil region
cupidin/homer <dig> is comprised of an n-terminal evh <dig> domain, a c-terminal coiled-coil  motif and two leu zipper motifs a and b  . our previous study indicated that cupidin interacts with cdc <dig> small gtpase in a gtp-dependent manner via the c-terminal region  <cit> . to narrow down the region responsible for cdc <dig> binding activity, we generated a series of glutathione s-transferase  fusion constructs containing various regions of cupidin , as shown in fig.  <dig>  these gst fusion proteins were blotted onto membrane filters and probed by a ligand overlay assay with gst-fused cdc <dig> in the presence of -gtpγs. as described previously  <cit> , gst-cpd and gst-cpd c  111–343), but not gst-cpd n , were radioactively labeled . no specific radioactive labeling of gst-cpd c was observed in the presence of -gdpβs and cdc <dig>  as previously reported  <cit> .

serial deletions starting every  <dig> aa from amino acid position  <dig> of cpd c  showed that the first four deletion mutants, but not the shortest mutant cpd 284– <dig>  retained cdc <dig> binding activity . because cpd 191– <dig> showed high radioactivity and cpd 231– <dig> showed low radioactivity, we made three further deletion mutants in the region aa 191– <dig>  . as a result, cpd 191– <dig> showed high radiolabeling, but neither cpd 191– <dig> nor cpd 231– <dig> showed significant labeling, suggesting that the region between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> is necessary for cdc <dig> binding. we further n-terminally and c-terminally deleted the region 191– <dig> to generate  <dig> deletion mutants and obtained radiolabeling from only the parental cpd 191– <dig>  but not from any of the mutants, indicating that the cdc42-binding domain resides in the region 191– <dig> . the region 191– <dig> contains a part of the upstream leu zipper motif lza. thus, we generated three internal deletion constructs: cpdΔ191– <dig>  and cpdΔ231– <dig>  lacked lza but contained the downstream leu zipper motif lzb, while cpdΔ191– <dig>  harbored both lza and lzb . cpdΔ191– <dig> showed radiolabeling that tended to be lower than that of cpd 191– <dig>  whereas cpdΔ191– <dig> and cpdΔ231– <dig> showed no significant radiolabeling.

to assess the multimerization ability of these cupidin deletion mutants, the gst-proteins were treated with thrombin to remove the gst moiety, which are known to bind each other, and was subjected to a mobility shift assay using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  after treatment with the cross-linker dimethyl pimalidate . upon dmp treatment, immunoreactivity for cpdΔ191– <dig> containing both lza and lzb was enhanced at a position indicative of multimers in comparison with that for cpdΔ191– <dig> and cpdΔ231– <dig>  both of which contained lzb only . to test a possible correlation between multimerization and cdc- <dig> binding ability, we coexpressed both gfp- and flag-tagged constructs of cpd or cpdΔ191– <dig> in cos cells together with either dominant-active cdc <dig>  or dominant-negative cdc <dig> , followed by evaluation of the interaction between gfp- and flag-tagged constructs using immunoprecipitation with an anti-flag antibody . with both cpd and cpdΔ191– <dig> constructs, gfp-tagged constructs were coimmunoprecipitated with flag-tagged constructs in intact cells, regardless of whether they expressed active or inactive cdc <dig>  although the coimmunoprecipitation efficiency of gfp-tagged cpdΔ191– <dig>  which showed a loss of cdc42-binding activity, was 30% lower than that of gfp-tagged cpd, these results indicated that cdc <dig> binding to cupidin is substantially independent of the self-multimerization of cupidin.

the cupidin-cdc <dig> interaction influences actin-cytoskeletal organization and the morphology of hela cells
we previously showed that co-expressed cupidin suppresses the dominant-active cdc42-induced morphological and actin-cytoskeletal changes in hela cells  <cit> . to verify the cellular function of cdc <dig> binding, we analyzed the influence of cdc42-binding deficiency on these cellular phenotypes . in hela cells transfected with cpd full-length or cpdΔ191– <dig>  stress fibers and bundles of f-actin were formed in the cytoplasm and the cell periphery, respectively, as in cells transfected with vector alone . upon expression of cdc42v <dig>  a dominant-active form of cdc <dig>  many filopodia-like protrusions with actin bundles were drastically induced around the cell periphery. co-expression of the cpd diminished the number of cdc42v12-induced protrusions and actin bundles in the cell periphery. by contrast, co-expression of cpdΔ191– <dig> did not affect cdc42v12-induced cellular phenotypes, as statistically proven by counting spike number around the cell periphery . these results indicated that the region containing amino acids 191– <dig> is required for the suppression of cdc42v12-induced morphological and actin-cytoskeletal changes in hela cells.

the cdc42-binding domain of cupidin is involved in the formation of dendritic spines and synapses in hippocampal neurons
cupidin is predominantly localized in the dendritic spines of cultured hippocampal neurons  <cit> . to investigate the role of cdc <dig> binding in the postsynaptic targeting of cupidin, we infected primary hippocampal cell cultures with recombinant adenovirus vectors containing enhanced green fluorescent protein -fused cpd, gfp-fused cpdΔ191– <dig> and gfp alone. punctate fluorescence of gfp-cpd and gfp-cpdΔ191– <dig> was observed throughout the dendrites of hippocampal neurons . in neurons expressing gfp-cpd, approximately 60% of the total punctate fluorescent signals were located at spine heads, whereas less than 10% of these were detected in dendritic shafts . on the other hand, in neurons expressing gfp-cpdΔ191– <dig>  about 40% and 30% of the total fluorescent puncta were localized in spine heads and dendritic shafts, respectively . these results suggested that the cupidin c-terminal region possessing cdc <dig> binding activity contributes to the targeting of cupidin to dendritic spines.

overexpression of cupidin induced mushroom-type spines in hippocampal neurons as shown in fig. 4c. on the other hand, overexpression of gfp-cpdΔ191– <dig> decreased the number of mushroom-type spines and increased filopodia-like or odd-shaped protrusions, although the total number of dendritic protrusions was only slightly reduced in neurons expressing gfp-cpdΔ191– <dig> compared with neurons expressing gfp-cpd and gfp alone . these results are consistent with the idea that cdc42-binding domain of cupidin is important for spine morphogenesis and/or maturation.

the effect of cdc <dig> binding to cupidin on synapse formation was analyzed by immunostaining for synaptophysin, a presynapse marker . the number of synaptophysin-positive puncta was drastically reduced in adjacent to dendrites of neurons overexpressing gfp-cpdΔ191– <dig>  in addition, the number of synaptophysin puncta localized adjacent to gfp-cpdΔ191– <dig> puncta was also decreased. we further explored synaptic functions by measuring the peak amplitudes and frequencies of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents  in neurons overexpressing these constructs at  <dig> div . while the amplitudes of mepscs in neurons overexpressing gfp-cpd  did not significantly differ from those in neurons overexpressing gfp , the mepsc amplitudes in neurons overexpressing gfp-cpdΔ191– <dig> were significantly reduced . the mepsc frequency was enhanced by overexpression of either gfp-cpd  or gfp-cpdΔ191– <dig>  in comparison with overexpression of gfp alone , although at present we could not indicate whether this increased frequency reflects an alteration in the presynaptic release probability or the number of functional synapses. taken together, these results suggested that a deletion in the cdc42-binding domain disturbs not only synapse formation, but also synapse electrophysiology.

the cupidin-cdc <dig> domain is involved in drebrin targeting into dendritic spines
a homology search with the homer ligand ppxxf motif identified two homologous sites  in the c-terminal region of mouse drebrin . coimmunoprecipitation with anti-homer antibodies  revealed an association between homer proteins and drebrin proteins  in p <dig> mouse brains . since the anti-drebrin monoclonal antibody used recognizes the c-terminal region near the ppxxf motifs, the anti-drebrin antibody might interfere with the cupidin-drebrin interaction in a reverse coimmunoprecipitation of cupidin with anti-drebrin antibody. thus, we carried out an overlay assay in which cupidin was tested for binding to a polypeptide containing two drebrin ppxxf motifs  or its double mutant  blotted onto a membrane filter . cupidin bound to the ppxxf-containing polypeptide, but not to the mutant polypeptide, again indicating that cupidin interacts with the c-terminal ppxxf motifs of drebrin.

endogenous cupidin and drebrin were both punctately distributed in dendritic spines of immunostained primary hippocampal neurons . cupidin puncta  largely overlapped with drebrin puncta  around the bottom half of spine heads. we next analyzed the effects of gfp, gfp-cpd, or gfp- cpdΔ191– <dig> overexpression on the dendritic distribution of drebrin in primary hippocampal neurons . the number of drebrin puncta was slightly reduced by overexpressing cupidin, but was significantly reduced by overexpressing gfp-cpdΔ191– <dig> . taken together, these results suggested that a deletion in the cdc42-binding region of cupidin disturbs dendritic drebrin distribution in hippocampal neurons.

discussion
our study demonstrates the structural and functional interaction of cupidin/homer <dig> with two dendritic spine f-actin modulators, cdc <dig> small gtpase, via the c-terminal region, and drebrin, via the n-terminal evh <dig> domain. cdc <dig> regulates actin polymerization and is involved in filopodia formation  <cit>  and dendritic spine morphogenesis  <cit> . over-expression of drebrin increases spine length  <cit>  and promotes synaptic clustering of psd- <dig> and f-actin  <cit> . homer also interacts with shank, another postsynaptic scaffold protein that binds to the gkap/psd-95/nmda receptor complex  <cit> . overexpression of shank together with homer induces enlargement of spine heads  <cit>  and increases the level of the βpix guanine nucleotide exchange factor  for cdc <dig> in the psd  <cit> . moreover, oligophrenin- <dig> , a rho gtpase activating protein  that is involved in non-specific x-linked mental retardation and binds homer1b/c, changes spine morphology in hippocampal neurons  <cit> . taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that postsynaptic homer-mediated scaffolding is involved in the regulation of dendritic spine morphology by interacting with the actin organization signaling molecules cdc <dig> and drebrin, as well as synaptic signaling molecules including the nmda receptor complex, mglur1α/ <dig> subunits and insp3r .

we defined the cdc42-binding domain  as the  <dig> amino acid residues in positions 191– <dig> within the c-terminal cc region. among homer family members, there are fragmentary sequence similarities  in the cbd region . homer interacts with ophn- <dig> gap  <cit> , whereas shank interacts with βpix gef  <cit> , as described above. thus, homer-shank scaffolds linking these gap and gef activities may synergistically regulate the activation  and inactivation  of cdc <dig>  which is involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation via the n-wasp, irsp53-wave or pak signaling pathways  <cit> , resulting in fine regulation of spine morphology.

the n-terminal evh <dig> domain of homer recognizes the homer ligand motif ppxxf  <cit> . homer-binding target proteins identified thus far have only one ppxxf motif, except that trpc <dig>  has two homer binding sites, referred to as type  <dig>  and atypical type  <dig>   <cit> . intriguingly, mouse, rat and human drebrin proteins  possess two conserved type  <dig> homer ligand motifs  in the c-terminal region . however, the truncated variant s-drebrin has no motif. these lines of evidence suggest that the cupidin/homer2-drebrin interaction is regulated by expression of these various forms. chick and xenopus drebrin have only homer ligand- <dig>  although their motif sequence  is identical to that of mouse, rat and human. an association of decreased levels of drebrin with deterioration of spines and synapses was reported in the hippocampal synapses  <cit>  and brains  <cit>  of patients with alzheimer's disease  as well as in aβ peptide-treated hippocampal neurons  <cit> . thus, the interaction between cupidin/homer <dig> and drebrin may be associated with the changes in spine morphology found in individuals with ad.

CONCLUSIONS
cupidin/homer <dig> interacts with activated cdc <dig> via the cdc42-binding domain within the c-terminal coiled-coil domain, which may play a role in the suppression of cdc42-induced filopodia-like protrusion formation in hela cells and the formation of mushroom-type spines in hippocampal neurons. cupidin/homer <dig> interacts with a dendritic spine f-actin-binding protein drebrin via the n-terminal evh- <dig> domain. drebrin possesses two homer ligand motifs in the c-terminal region, and is mostly colocalized with cupidin around the spine heads. drebrin clustering in dendritic spines is disturbed by overexpression of cupidin deficient in cdc <dig> binding. these results suggest that cupidin/homer <dig> is involved in the modulation of spine morphology and function by scaffolding multiple target proteins, including the two dendritic spine actin regulators cdc <dig> small gtpase and drebrin.
