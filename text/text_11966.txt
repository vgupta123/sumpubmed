BACKGROUND
in oilseed plants such as arabidopsis  and rapeseed , developing embryos are green and cells in these embryos develop functional chloroplasts  <cit> . the green embryos are capable of photosynthesis and have been shown to fix carbon crucial to the biosynthesis of seed storage oils  <cit> . in experiments with cultured rapeseed embryos and siliques, light was found to increase embryo growth-rates, which correlated both with improved carbon sequestration and with its utilization in seed oil synthesis  <cit> . these effects were largely negated by inhibition of photosynthesis, and their studies indicated that it is the reductant and/or atp produced by photosynthesis in green embryos that is important for normal embryo growth and seed development.

arabidopsis embryos begin to develop chloroplasts and appear green around  <dig> days after pollination and the chloroplasts remain present for up to approximately  <dig> days after pollination  <cit> . when seeds are maturing during late embryogenesis , the chloroplasts dedifferentiate and lose their chlorophyll, starch, and internal membranes to seed storage reserves, which results in the formation of white embryos in mature arabidopsis seed  <cit> . in soybean , a small simple plastid called an eoplast has been found in fully mature embryo cells  <cit> . eoplasts resemble proplastids but are derived from chloroplasts. thus far, eoplasts have not been observed in mature arabidopsis embryos, largely because the embryo cells are so densely packed with lipid and protein bodies  <cit> . nevertheless, a basal-state plastid must be maintained in the cells of fully mature arabidopsis embryos since chloroplasts, amyloplasts, and the various other plastid types re-develop upon seedling germination. the development of these plastids early after germination can be critical for seedling survival since, in addition to photosynthesis and the production of starch, plastids are also involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acids  <cit> , nucleic acids, and amino acids  <cit> .

although a good deal is known about the physiological and biochemical functions of chloroplasts during embryo growth and seed production, investigations of chloroplast development during embryogenesis have been largely descriptive  <cit> . to identify molecular components involved in plastid development during the youngest phase of the arabidopsis life cycle, a screen was conducted to identify mutants that specifically influence plastid development in embryos and seedling tissues derived from the embryo, but not in tissues derived from the apical meristem. mutants were identified that exhibited cotyledon and hypocotyl albinism upon germination due to improper chloroplast development, while photosynthetic tissues derived from the shoot apical meristem were green and appeared to develop normal chloroplasts. this paper describes mutants in a gene that encodes for a plastid-localized elongation factor g . one mutant allele from an ems- mutagenized population was found to be the result of the same nucleotide substitution responsible for the recently described snowy cotyledon  <dig>   mutant  <cit> . two alleles with t-dna insertions directly in this gene resulted in embryo lethality, demonstrating that this ef-g is essential during embryogenesis. our analysis of the different mutant alleles of sco <dig> indicate that differentiation of eoplasts to chloroplasts during germination may have different requirements for protein translation than for proplastid to chloroplast differentiation in cells derived from the apical meristem.

RESULTS
embryo-lethal sco <dig> alleles
two alleles of sco <dig>  isolated from the salk t-dna insert collection have t-dna inserts at the c-terminal end of the gene . in sco1- <dig>  all of the t <dig> seed tested developed green cotyledons. genotypic analysis of the viable progeny showed that these plants consisted of a segregating population with a ratio of 1: <dig> for wild-type to heterozygote for the t-dna insert in the sco <dig> gene. no viable progeny were found that were homozygous for the t-dna insert. moreover, examination of developing siliques on plants that were heterozygous for the sco1- <dig> t-dna insert revealed that approximately 25% of the developing ovules were white . the  <dig> d-old white ovules were similar in size to the green ovules, but upon dissection they did not appear to contain a developing embryo. this was presumably due to abortion of the embryo at a very early stage of embryogenesis. similar results were observed for the sco1- <dig> t-dna insertion line . these findings indicate that null mutants in sco <dig> are lethal early during embryo development and that the ef-g encoded by sco <dig> is essential for plant development.

conditional seedling-lethal sco <dig> alleles
we identified one ems-derived sco mutant that, upon mapping and sequencing, was found to be identical to the sco <dig> allele recently identified by albrecht et al.  <cit> , where a g to a base change converted a conserved glycine residue to an arginine. we have designated this allele as sco1- <dig> . seedlings of sco1- <dig> rarely survived past the cotyledon stage unless they were provided with supplementary carbon . in addition, an allele  with a salk t-dna insert located  <dig> base-pairs upstream of the sco <dig> atg start site was found to have a similar seedling-lethal phenotype. however, sco1- <dig> plants could also be rescued when germinated on medium supplemented with sugar . unlike the white cotyledons of sco1- <dig> , sco1- <dig> seedlings had very pale green cotyledons . when germinated on media with sucrose, the first true leaves that emerged from sco1- <dig> seedlings were initially pale, but when transplanted to soil, the seedlings were able to survive and the rosette leaves of adult plants resembled wild type .

plastid development in the sco <dig> mutant
although most sco1- <dig> cotyledons appear completely white, fluorescence microscopy revealed some red autofluorescence is present in all mutant cotyledons, especially along the vasculature . the red autofluorescence, which is indicative of the presence of chlorophyll, suggested that chloroplast development was not completely blocked in the mutant seedlings despite the visually albino appearance. also, upon closer examination of some sco1- <dig> seedlings, we often observed patches of green cells, which were typically located near the margin of the cotyledons and in the upper hypocotyl . the extent of this sectoring phenotype varied from seedling to seedling. in the absence of supplemental sugar, over 80% of the sco1- <dig> seedlings failed to produce true leaves and died . the mutant seedlings that were able to survive without the supplemental carbon source typically had larger patches of green cells in their cotyledons and/or hypocotyls. these patches of green cells were presumably capable of providing the seedling with photosynthate and other essential plastid-derived components necessary for survival until the first true green leaves could develop from the apical meristem. similarly, sco1- <dig> seedlings that were able to survive when germinated in soil had large green patches . leaves and other photosynthetic tissues derived from the apical meristem in sco1- <dig> were green and visually indistinguishable from wild-type plants .

to evaluate the structural development of chloroplasts in the cotyledons, we examined cells by light and transmission electron microscopy in 5-d-old wild-type and sco1- <dig> cotyledons. as expected, cotyledon mesophyll cells of light-grown wild-type seedlings contained numerous well-developed chloroplasts . in contrast, chloroplasts were essentially absent from cotyledon mesophyll cells of typical sco1- <dig> seedlings except in the bundle sheath cells that surround the cotyledon vasculature , consistent with the appearance of red autofluorescence . in thin-sections from 'green-sectored' sco1- <dig> cotyledons , we observed chloroplast-containing mesophyll cells directly adjacent to cells that are devoid of chloroplasts. the chloroplasts that developed in green sco1- <dig> cells appeared normal and showed characteristics of typical wild-type chloroplasts .

since chloroplast development was altered in sco1- <dig> seedlings, we stained seedlings for starch to determine if amyloplast development was also altered. starch staining revealed that sco1- <dig> hypocotyls contained starch grains, indicative of the presence of amyloplasts in the endodermis . starch grains in sco1- <dig> root columella cells also appeared similar to those in wild type . consistent with the role of amyloplasts in gravity perception  <cit> , gravitropism of hypocotyl, root, and inflorescence in sco1- <dig> was found to be similar to wild type . these data indicate that amyloplast development is normal in the sco1- <dig> mutant seedlings.

transcript abundance in conditional-lethal sco <dig> alleles
given the location of the genetic lesions in sco1- <dig> and sco1- <dig>  we wanted to determine if the relative abundance of sco <dig> transcript in each mutant was related to the different albinism phenotypes of their cotyledons. using primers specific to sco <dig>  we determined that sco <dig> transcript abundance was similar in wild-type and sco1- <dig> seedlings . since the ems mutation in sco1- <dig> converts a glycine contained within the gtp-binding domain to an arginine, transcription was expected to be similar to wild-type. however, the level of transcript in sco1- <dig> is significantly reduced, which is consistent with the location of the t-dna insert in the promoter region of sco <dig>  the level of transcript amplification of ubiquitin  was similar in the mutants and wild type. we also found that sco <dig> protein tagged with gfp was targeted to chloroplasts and to several non-photosynthetic plastids , confirming data presented by albrecht et al.  <cit> .

embryo development in wild type and sco <dig> 
since arabidopsis embryos are green during much of their growth, we examined embryos of sco1- <dig> plants to determine if chloroplast development was impaired in the mutant during embryogenesis. embryos dissected from the middle of siliques between  <dig> and  <dig> days after fertilization  showed that sco1- <dig> and wild-type embryos were similar in both morphology and developmental rate . embryos from both sco1- <dig> and wild type were observed to become visibly green around  <dig> daf, and remained so until approximately  <dig> daf when the chloroplasts began to dedifferentiate in preparation for dehydration and maturation of the seed. sco1- <dig> embryos dissected from siliques that were  <dig> , or  <dig> daf and the embryos were still green, were able to develop green hypocotyls and cotyledons when precociously germinated on agar growth medium, but embryos dissected after the embryos had turned white  developed the characteristic white cotyledons seen in the sco1- <dig> mutant . at  <dig> daf, arabidopsis embryos are in the early stages of desiccation and the onset of dormancy, and chloroplasts are beginning to dedifferentiate  <cit> . since the sco1- <dig> phenotype could be rescued by bypassing the maturation stage of embryogenesis, the function of the mutant ef-g appears to be particularly critical during late stages of embryo development when eoplasts form.

expression levels of the arabidopsis ef-gs
the most current annotation of the arabidopsis genome predicts a total of three nuclear-encoded ef-gs. unlike the plastid-targeted sco <dig>  the two other ef-gs  contain predicted mitochondrial-targeting sequences  <cit> . according to the subcellular prediction program targetp, their targeting sequences may allow for dual targeting of the proteins to the mitochondria and plastids. during the course of arabidopsis development, sco <dig> is the most highly expressed of the ef-gs, with expression levels peaking at  <dig>  times the levels of at1g <dig> and at2g <dig> in cotyledon tissue . transcript levels of sco <dig> are reduced in adult rosette tissue as compared to cotyledon tissue, whereas at1g <dig> and at2g <dig> mean expression levels remain relatively constant throughout development, but are always much lower than for sco <dig> 

discussion
sco <dig> encodes for a translation elongation factor g
in general, the chloroplast genome encodes for genes that can be classified into several functional categories, including genes specific to transcription and translation within the plastid, photosynthetic genes, and genes involved in the synthesis of metabolic compounds  <cit> . many of the components of the chloroplast proteome, however, are nuclear-encoded  <cit> , including a number of factors that have been shown to be important in regulating translation of plastid genes  <cit> . for example, studies in various plant species indicated that protein initiation factors and elongation factors, including elongation factors ef-g and ef-tu, are present in the nuclear genome and contain chloroplast-targeting sequences  <cit> . much of our knowledge of plastid gene function in transcription and translation has drawn from structural and functional similarities to prokaryotic proteins that serve in a similar capacity. the presence of plastid-specific ribosomal proteins , however, indicates that at least some aspects of the translation mechanism in chloroplasts is unique to plants  <cit> .

as shown here and by albrecht et al.  <cit> , the nuclear sco <dig> gene encodes for a protein translation elongation factor g with a chloroplast-targeting signal sequence. although biochemical activity has not been directly demonstrated for sco <dig>  similar functionality seems highly likely since the predicted amino acid sequence of sco <dig> is over 50% identical to the e. coli ef-g fusa , including conservation of glycine  <dig>  which was changed to an arginine in the sco1- <dig> mutant.

during the elongation phase of plastid protein biosynthesis, the elongation factor ef-tu binds to an aminoacyl-trna, which is then directed to the a site of the ribosome. the ef-g protein is then required to translocate the newly formed peptidyl-trna from the ribosomal a-site to the p-site. although the sco1- <dig> mutant is viable when provided with sucrose during germination , the two alleles we identified with t-dna insertions in the sco <dig> coding sequence  have an embryo-lethal phenotype , indicating that sco <dig> is an essential gene. the g to a base change in the sco1- <dig> mutant converted a conserved glycine residue to an arginine at position  <dig>  which is between the p-loop and switch i regions of the conserved gtp-binding domain found in the 70s-ribosome-binding region of elongation factors. since the activity of ef-g is dependent upon hydrolysis of gtp  <cit> , the amino acid change in sco1- <dig> may interfere with gtp hydrolysis activity in the mutant protein, affecting binding to or release from the ribosome. since sco1- <dig> plants are viable once they produce leaves from the apical meristem, the mutant ef-g produced is likely to retain partial ef-g activity. however, we have not found reports describing a similar mutation in e. coli.

the sco1- <dig> allele, which contains a t-dna insertion upstream of the sco <dig> start site, most likely produces a normal ef-g but at reduced levels compared to wild type , which could cause the pale cotyledon phenotype . the different cotyledon phenotypes of sco1- <dig> and sco1- <dig> is likely due to differences in the manner in which translation is altered. previous research has demonstrated that in adult leaf tissues, proper plastid protein translation is absolutely essential for cell survival  <cit> , and a similar reduction in protein translation in sco1- <dig>  <cit>  reveals that plastid protein translation is also critical during seedling development.

sco <dig> is critical during late embryogenesis and/or early germination
the plastid defects seen in sco1- <dig> and sco1- <dig> are most pronounced in seedling cells that were derived from the embryo. a few other published arabidopsis mutants exhibit seedling-specific abnormal chloroplast development, including white cotyledon  <dig>   <cit>  and sigma factor  <dig>   <cit> . mutations in sig <dig> cause similar seedling stage-specific effects on chloroplast development to sco1- <dig>  such as albino to pale-green cotyledons and normal leaf development. it was suggested that the sig <dig> mutant is able to produce normal chloroplasts in adult tissues due to redundancy in the role of sigma factors throughout development. in the wco <dig> mutant, the white cotyledon phenotype is highly dependent on light intensity, and the plants show various other defects in addition to the seedling albinism, including a marked reduction of chlorophyll content in adult rosette leaves. the wco <dig> phenotype is thought to result from a disruption of  <dig> s rrna maturation, making it one of several mutants that appear to affect  <dig> s rrna maturation and disrupt chloroplast development  <cit> .

since the eoplast to chloroplast transition is defective in sco1- <dig> and sco1- <dig> mutants, it appears that sco <dig> activity is particularly critical during either the transition from chloroplast to eoplast, or when eoplasts redifferentiate into chloroplasts after germination. when we precociously germinated sco1- <dig> embryos before their chloroplasts had converted to eoplasts, green seedlings were obtained, indicating that some aspect of eoplast formation is critical for the sco1- <dig> mutant phenotype to develop. because all plastid types would be expect to be impaired if eoplasts were abnormal, the presence of starch-containing amyloplasts in sco1- <dig> seedlings suggests that eoplast formation may be relatively normal in the mutant embryos and that the eoplast to chloroplast transition may be more demanding of ef-g activity than for the eoplast to amyloplast transition. consistent with observations in albrecht et al.  <cit> , we found that the sco <dig> tagged with gfp was targeted to chloroplasts. in addition to this previously determined chloroplast targeting, we found that the sco1::gfp was also localized to non-photosynthetic plastids such as those in root and petal cells.

even in the white sco1- <dig> cotyledons, chloroplasts were observed by chlorophyll fluorescence and microscopy in cells surrounding the vasculature . in addition, while some sco1- <dig> seedlings appear almost entirely albino , others show a variegated phenotype with sectors of 'wild-type' green cells . when green sectors are present, they are mostly located around the cotyledon margin and the cells appear to contain a full complement of chloroplasts. it has been shown that lipid and starch deposition, which are associated with the progression of maturation in cotyledons of developing soybean embryos, begins in the interior cells of the organ and progresses to the periphery  <cit> . if maturation of arabidopsis cotyledons follows a similar gradient, cells along the margin may not fully dedifferentiate their chloroplasts into eoplasts prior to seed maturation. since we could rescue the sco1- <dig> phenotype by precocious germination, it is possible that the stages of plastid development that appear to be most dependent on sco <dig> activity may be bypassed in a subset of cells that happen to arrest prior to full eoplast formation.

the lethality of the t-dna insertion alleles  is consistent with the hypothesis that sco <dig> represents an essential gene in arabidopsis involved in protein synthesis in plastids. there are at least two other predicted ef-gs in the arabidopsis genome, both of which are predicted to encode ef-gs with mitochondrial-targeting and possibly plastid-targeting sequences. dual targeting has been observed for other plant transcripts, including at least  <dig> of the arabidopsis aminoacyl-trna synthetases  <cit> . at1g <dig> and at2g <dig> are over 98% identical to each other and show 43% identity and 62% similarity to sco <dig>  respectively, excluding the targeting sequences. if at1g <dig> and/or at2g <dig> are dual-targeted, it is possible that they may provide ef-g activity in at least some cell and/or plastid types that can aid, or compensate for, the impaired activity of sco <dig> in the sco1- <dig> and sco1- <dig> mutants. it is also possible that one or both of these other ef-g genes can contribute to protein synthesis during later stages of plant development, which could allow the sco1- <dig> and sco1- <dig> mutants to develop green leaves. it is also possible that in the absence of normal sco <dig> levels, expression of the other ef-gs may be increased. however, expression analyses of these three ef-gs in wild-type plants indicates that sco <dig> expression greatly exceeds that of the other two ef-gs in both cotyledons and mature leaves . more detailed analysis of expression levels and protein localization for all three ef-gs during development will help distinguish between the various potential explanations. given the lethal phenotype of t-dna inserts in sco <dig>  however, neither of these other ef-gs appears fully capable of providing sufficient ef-g function for plastid development in the absence of sco <dig> activity during early stages of embryo development.

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here show that the ef-g encoded by the sco <dig> gene in arabidopsis is essential for plant growth since t-dna insertions in the gene cause embryo lethality. the stage-specific phenotypes of the sco1- <dig> and sco1- <dig> mutants described here, and for the wco <dig> and sig <dig> mutants, reveal fundamental differences between plastid development in embryo-derived cells and cells derived from the apical meristem. analysis of other seedling plastid-defective mutants should provide a better understanding of plastid formation during this critical period in plant development.
