BACKGROUND
a major challenge in plant biology is the identification of biological functions for all genes from the main model plant species, arabidopsis thaliana and rice. to this end, a large number of genetics and genomics resources are being developed in both model plants  <cit> . in particular, collections of induced mutants that can be screened by reverse genetics, such as t-dna or transposon insertional mutants  <cit>  provide a unique resource for functional studies. however, the mutational spectrum of insertional mutagenesis with effect on gene function is mostly limited to gene knock-out disruptions. genes whose severe loss-of-function is lethal or highly pleiotropic cannot be functionally dissected with such mutants. in addition, the size of saturated populations containing insertion mutants randomly generated for most genes of an organism is extremely high because each line carries only a rather small number of mutations  <cit> . as a complementary resource, chemically induced mutants have been shown to provide an efficient alternative because each individual line can bear single point missense and nonsense substitutions in hundreds of genes  <cit> . therefore, an allelic series of induced mutations with different effects on gene function can be easily isolated by screening a few thousands mutagenized plants  <cit> .

in the past few years, chemically induced mutants have become a major resource for reverse genetics studies thanks to the development of tilling   <cit> . tilling enables the reverse selection of single point mutations by cleavage of mismatches in heteroduplex dna with the endonuclease cel i. this powerful strategy was first applied in an a. thaliana mutant collection induced with ethyl methanesulphonate   <cit>  in the commonest genetic background columbia  whose genome sequence had been first completed  <cit> . since then, tilling collections of ems induced mutants have been developed in a large number of plant species including rice, maize, barley, sorghum, wheat, brassica napus, b. oleracea and medicago truncatula, as well as model animals like drosophila and caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . in most of these ems mutant collections, reference genetic backgrounds of wide and general interest are used. however, given the limitations of having mutations in a single genetic background, new populations of chemically induced mutants for tilling analyses are currently being developed in other reference strains of several species like rice or soybean  <cit> . in addition, the quality of tilling mutant populations is determined by the density of mutations per individual, since this limits the size of allelic series than can be isolated for each gene and the size of a saturated genome population. for this reason, other tilling populations have been developed in rice, barley, soybean or m. truncatula, aiming to increase the amount of mutations per line by either using different mutagens like sodium azide and n-methyl-n-nitrosourea or increasing the mutagen dose  <cit> .

in a. thaliana, several reference genetic backgrounds are widely used such as col or landsberg erecta . the latter is the second most commonly studied strain because many mutants have been classically isolated in it and a large portion of its genome sequence was available soon after col sequence  <cit> . in this work we have developed a new collection of a. thaliana ems induced mutants for tilling reverse genetics, aiming at two major objectives. first, to extend tilling resources in a. thaliana by using ler reference genetic background, for which reverse genetic tools are rather limited. second, to enrich the number of independent mutations available in this collection as much as possible by increasing the density of mutations per line. tilling evaluation of this population for several gene fragments indicates that it carries the largest density of chemically induced mutations reported in diploid organisms, hence demonstrating its usefulness for reverse selection of mutants.

RESULTS
generation of a permanent collection of highly ems-mutagenized lines in arabidopsis
to obtain a new population of chemically induced mutant lines useful for reverse genetic studies in arabidopsis thaliana, seeds of the landsberg erecta  glabrous1- <dig> genotype were mutagenized with ems at concentrations of  <dig> to  <dig> mm . the effects of ems and the efficiency of the mutagenesis treatment were estimated by quantifying three parameters on m <dig> plants: seed germination, frequency of albino chimeras and fertility . germination of m <dig> seeds was negatively correlated with ems dose , while the frequency of m <dig> albino chimeras increased with concentration  . seed fertility of m <dig> plants and the degree of m <dig> embryo lethality was quantified by estimating the proportion of fully or nearly sterile fruits  and the proportion of semi or normal fertile fruits . as shown in figure 1c, the total frequency of class a fruits increased linearly with ems concentration, whereas the frequency of fertile fruits rapidly decreased. to maximize the frequency of mutations per individual, only m <dig> plants from treatments showing a frequency of fertile fruits smaller than 35% but larger than 2% were individually harvested. a total of  <dig> m <dig> families were grown to isolate individual m <dig> dna and to harvest their m <dig> offspring seeds. to ensure independence of the mutations present in this population, a single m <dig> plant was harvested from each m <dig> plant. in agreement with the high proportion of embryo lethality, all m <dig> families segregated for easily visible morphological mutations . fifty six percent of m <dig> lines were derived from  <dig> mm ems mutagenesis, and on average, ems treatments used to obtain the collection show less than 25% fertile fruits . the dna of m <dig> plants and the m <dig> seeds of the  <dig> lines were stored  providing a permanent population of mutant lines for tilling analysis in ler genetic background. this population has been named as the arabidopsis tiller collection.

ems dose
*: number of screened lines is estimated as the total sum of individuals analyzed for each of the  <dig> gene fragments.

**: weighted averages are shown according to frequency of lines of the different ems dose.

mutation frequency, distribution and functional spectrum in tiller collection
the quality of this collection for mutant discovery was evaluated after the analysis of  <dig> gene fragments distributed among four of the five a. thaliana chromosomes and chosen from requests by different research laboratories . these fragments have a gc content similar to that of fragments studied in col background tilling collection  <cit>  and to average coding regions of a. thaliana genome  <cit> . on average, amplicons were  <dig>  kb long and  <dig> % corresponded to exon sequence, which is similar to genome average exon proportion  <cit> . in total, we found and confirmed by sequencing  <dig> mutations in the  <dig>  kb analyzed from different amplicons. all mutations corresponded to g/c to a/t transitions, in agreement with the nearly unique type of nucleotide substitutions observed in previous analyses of ems-mutagenized a. thaliana plants  <cit> . the distribution of mutations among the ems doses of the lines was independent of the number of lines per dose . a larger number of mutations were found at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mm than expected from the number of lines, while the opposite was found at  <dig> mm. in addition,  <dig> lines carried several mutations in the same or two different gene fragments . an excess of these lines was found in plants derived from high ems concentrations  while a deficiency appears in low ems concentrations  when comparing with the expected number according to the proportion of lines from each ems dose . therefore, the higher the ems concentration used to obtain the lines, the larger the number of mutations per line.

*: number of heterozygous/homozygous mutations are given for each of the three mutations classes.

**: truncations include mutations generating premature stop codons and mutations in splice sites.

on average we analyzed  <dig> lines per fragment and detected  <dig>  mutations per  <dig> mutant lines . twenty-one to  <dig> mutations were found per fragment, and in most gene fragments there was a reduction of mutation detection in the ~ <dig> bp terminal segments , as expected from li-cor detection system . however, mutations appeared evenly distributed along the rest of the gene fragments within exon and intron regions .

for all but one gene fragment we found mutations of three classes according to their predicted effects on protein structure: silent, missense and truncation mutations . the observed frequencies of the three classes of mutations fitted the expected frequencies of silent, missense and truncations, respectively, as estimated by coddle analyses . truncations include nonsense mutations generating premature stop codons and mutations in intron splice sites, the observed frequencies of both classes  also fitting expected frequencies . interestingly, truncation mutations were obtained for  <dig> of the  <dig> fragments, as expected from their  <dig> % frequency and the large average number of mutations found per gene .

as shown in table  <dig>  an average ratio of heterozygous/homozygous mutations of  <dig>  was found, which is significantly different from the expected 2: <dig> proportion for m <dig> plants . although an excess of heterozygotes appeared for silent mutations , this ratio was extreme for truncations since all but one of such mutations were present as heterozygotes. in addition, distortion from the expected proportion was larger for high ems dose lines  than for low concentrations  .

from these analyses we estimated an average density of detected mutations per line of  <dig> mutation per  <dig> kb , which was calculated after subtracting  <dig> terminal base pairs with low li-cor detection, from each amplicon . however, the density of mutations varied from 1/ <dig> kb to 1/ <dig> kb depending on the ems dose used to generate the lines, a two-fold variation being found between  <dig> and  <dig> mm . to contrast this average mutation frequency estimation, the density of mutations was also independently calculated from the number of pool samples with two mutant individuals in the same fragment or from the number of individual lines with two mutations in the same gene fragment  <cit> . forty-four pool samples were found to carry two mutant individuals when analyzing the individual lines. thus, a total of  <dig> pool samples were originally detected as positive pools, which contain  <dig> ×  <dig> individuals representing a sample analyzed at individual level to find second mutations. from these  <dig> pool samples with at least one positive line we estimated a density of  <dig> mutation/ <dig> kb , which is similar to previous estimate. on the other hand, when sequencing positive lines for their corresponding fragments, five individual lines were found to carry two mutations within the same fragment. therefore,  <dig> lines were sequenced and can be considered a sample analyzed to detect second mutations by sequencing. from these lines we calculated a density of  <dig> mutation/ <dig> kb , which is comparable to the above estimates. in contrast to previous calculations, this latest density was estimated from the complete amplicon length  because it was derived from the sequencing of entire fragments and not from li-cor detection of positive lines.

from the above density of mutations we have calculated an average number of  <dig> mutations per line, the complete tiller collection providing a total of  <dig>  million mutations. taking into account the observed frequencies of truncation and missense mutations , and the total length of gene regions of a. thaliana genome , we have roughly estimated that each tiller line contains, on average,  <dig> genes with knock-out mutations and  <dig> genes with aminoacid substitutions.

discussion
we have developed a new permanent collection of  <dig> independent ems-induced mutant lines for reverse genetic analysis in the reference laboratory strain landsberg erecta of a. thaliana. to maximize the number of mutations present in this population we have increased the frequency of mutations per m2/m <dig> line by using m <dig> plants with lower seed fertility than that of plants used to obtain the existing population in columbia background  <cit> . by compromising fertility, we aimed to saturate the number of chemically induced mutations that can be tolerated by a. thaliana plants that are still viable and able of sexual reproduction. we estimated that, on average, the lines of this new ler collection carry one mutation every  <dig> kb, which is significantly larger than the density of 1/ <dig> kb estimated in current col population  <cit> . as expected, we found that the higher the ems concentration the higher the density of detected mutations per line. thus, experimental control of ems mutagenesis enables substantial increase of the frequency of induced mutations in viable and seed fertile plants. however, we cannot discard that mutation density differences between both tilling populations of a. thaliana might be partly due to natural genetic variation between both wild type strains for their tolerance to chemically induced mutations. accordingly, it could be speculated that such natural variation might be determined by variation for reproductive system plasticity or for dna repair mechanisms.

as described by greene et al.  <cit>  estimations of the density of chemically induced mutations detected by tilling procedure can be biased due to several factors such as: 1) uneven mutation detection among the pools of eight plants; 2) uneven mutation detection along the length of gene fragments; 3) higher gc content of analyzed fragments  than average genome   <cit> ; and 4) dilution of one fourth of the m <dig> mutations in m <dig> plants. taking into account these factors, it has been estimated that col population shows a corrected average mutation density per line of 1/ <dig> kb. despite these factors, the 1/ <dig> kb average frequency of induced mutations detected in ler population is nearly twice higher than that of col. furthermore, ler lines obtained from the highest ems dose show a 1/ <dig> kb mutation density, which triplicates the lowest density estimate of col population. comparisons with tilling populations in other species indicates that a. thaliana ler collection carries the highest mutation density induced by different chemical agents in diploid plants, including brassica oleracea, medicago truncatula, rice, barley, maize and sorghum; or animals like drosophila and caenorhabditis elegans, or the oomycote phytophthora sojae . only rapeseed and wheat collections carry a higher density of mutations, as expected from their polyploid nature and consequently, their higher tolerance to loss-of-function mutations due to gene duplications and redundancies . thus, the density of mutations found in ler a. thaliana population increases the estimated load of chemically induced mutations that diploid species can tolerate in sexually fertile individuals.

the two a. thaliana tilling populations, ler and col, also differ in the proportion of heterozygous:homozygous mutations recovered in tilling analyses, ler showing substantially higher total average ratio than col   <cit> . the largest deficiency of homozygous mutations corresponds to truncations, which shows the largest difference between both populations . therefore, a stronger negative selection against deleterious mutations seems to affect ler than col collection. this is probably a consequence of the extreme high-density of mutations present in ler lines, since the maximum load of deleterious induced mutations that can be tolerated by a viable and fertile m <dig> plant will likely be determined by a threshold number of homozygous truncations and deleterious missense mutations. m <dig> plants carrying a higher number of homozygous deleterious mutations than this threshold will not be viable or fertile. given the self-fertilizing nature of a. thaliana, the higher the m <dig> mutation density, the higher the proportion of m <dig> offspring plants that will surpass the maximum number of homozygous deleterious mutations and, consequently, stronger selection against such mutations. thus, higher m <dig> mutation densities will lead to higher m <dig> ratios of heterozygous/homozygous mutations due to lower frequency of m <dig> plants below the threshold of homozygous deleterious mutations. this relationship is supported by the larger ratios observed in ler lines with high mutation density generated with ems doses ≥ <dig> mm, than in lines with lower density obtained with 25- <dig> mm ems. nevertheless, presumed silent mutations including synonymous and intronic mutations also showed a significant defect of homozygotes in ler collection, whereas this was not observed for missense mutations. potential genetic mechanisms accounting for this unexpected result are unknown but it cannot be discarded that the genes surveyed in this work are biased for the deleterious effect of their mutations. in agreement, other a. thaliana public mutant collections do not contain mutations in several of the genes analyzed here http://www.arabidopsis.org suggesting that mutations in their coding and non-coding regions show stronger deleterious defects than genome average.

CONCLUSIONS
the tiller collection generated in this work provides a new resource for reverse selection of ems induced mutants in a. thaliana. the high mutation density of this population increases the size of allelic series that can be obtained and reduces the population size that needs to be screened. however, this high mutation density implies that more backcrosses are required to eliminate undesired background mutations in selected mutant lines. it has been estimated that  <dig> mutations are necessary to have  <dig>  probability of finding a missense deleterious mutation per gene  <cit> . considering the ~50% observed frequency of missense mutations and assuming that 25% of them are deleterious, we have calculated that on average,  <dig> tiller lines are sufficient to obtain  <dig> mutations per ~ <dig> kb gene fragment, while the larger analyses carried out until now are providing additional truncation mutations for ~90% of the genes. currently, tiller collection is screened as a public service to search for mutants in genes of interest for any laboratory http://www.cnb.csic.es/~tiller/. the availability of another tilling service in the second commonest reference genetic background of a. thaliana enables deeper gene functional studies such as those aiming to uncover new gene effects or interactions of specific mutations with genetic backgrounds. given the success of current existing collections, it can be expected that the use of chemically induced genetic variation will further extend in the near future with the development of similar resources in other reference strains and/or using other mutagens.
