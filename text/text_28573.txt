BACKGROUND
the innate immune response plays an important role in the clearance of pathogens following an infection, including during bovine mastitis. components of the recognition and response pathway, mediated by toll-like receptor  <dig>  are susceptible to regulation of gene expression by epigenetic mechanisms. for example, dna-methylation of the tlr <dig> gene promoter has been linked to lower expression and diminished response to lps in intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> . conversely, dna hypomethylation has been implicated in over expression of myeloid differentiation factor - <dig> in human iecs leading to higher responsiveness to lps exposure  <cit> . therefore, it may be postulated that phenotypic variation in the response to lps between individuals may be partially controlled by epigenetic modification. environmental exposures have been linked to alteration in the innate immune response as well, with studies conducted on pregnant rats showing that prenatal exposure to lps leads to a suppressed innate immune response in offspring when examined at  <dig> days post birth  <cit>  or even after  <dig> weeks of life  <cit> . understanding the role of dna methylation on the lps response as an animal ages, may in time yield candidate regions of control to investigate differential responses to lps between animals.

we have previously demonstrated an age-dependent increase in the immune response of bovine dermal fibroblasts  <cit> , with cultures from collected the same individual at  <dig> versus  <dig> months of age showing an increase in il- <dig> production in response to lps. understanding the potential epigenetic mechanisms regulating the development of the bovine innate immune response within an individual could be used to help understand underlying causes of variation between individuals. for example, dairy cows display a range of responses when exposed to the same bacterial pathogen in experimental mastitis challenge studies  <cit> . we have also found a substantial range between animals in the magnitude of response of fibroblasts to lps stimulation that relates to the in vivo response to intravenous lps  <cit>  or intramammary e. coli challenge  <cit> . the use of fibroblasts collected from the same animal at different ages allows for the investigation of phenotypic variation without confounding genotypic differences.

one potential mechanism controlling the tlr response pathway may be dna methylation. some data exists on the role of dna methylation affecting the tlr <dig> signaling pathway in humans  <cit> , though only limited data exists for dairy cows  <cit> . in addition, changes in dna methylation with age have previously been described, further implicating it as a potential mechanism of age associated alterations in gene expression and innate immune response. analysis of human fibroblasts utilizing the infiniun humanmethylation <dig> assay, which investigates methylation levels at approximately  <dig>  cpg loci, identified both site specific and regional alterations of methylation levels when comparing younger  with older  individuals  <cit> . in a separate longitudinal study, use of the infinum humanmethylation <dig> assay found methylation differences between individuals at ages  <dig> and  <dig> years based upon hierarchical clustering, denoting changes both within and across individuals due to age  <cit> . our work aims to investigate whether a similar phenomenon may be occurring in the bovine model, and whether this may be linked to alterations in cell signaling and subsequent physiological processes.

while the bovine innate immune response has been well characterized under both in vitro and in vivo conditions  <cit> , little research has been conducted to determine the development of the response to lipopolysaccharide due to age within an individual. in addition, though a factor with potentially broad implications in gene expression and disease, there is only a limited data set available detailing dna methylation in the economically important bovine model. much of the previous work investigating the development of the innate immune response was conducted using mixed cell models from different individuals, which may yield false positive results due to variable cell-mixture proportions rather than true changes in methylation levels  <cit> . this study uses a pure cell model, and eliminated genotypic variation by isolating cells from the same individual at different ages reducing much of the technical and biological variation that may have been present in previous studies offering a clear view of the age-dependent changes in tlr <dig> signaling.

this study aimed to map transcriptomic alterations in the tlr <dig> response pathway of bovine dermal fibroblasts isolated from the same individuals at different ages and to determine what effect changes in dna methylation patterns have on this response. to accomplish this, rna-seq was performed on bovine dermal fibroblasts exposed to lps for  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours. in addition, methylated cpg island recovery assay sequencing  was performed on fibroblast dna from the same individuals collected at the two different ages. this project allowed for the first in depth look at transcriptome wide changes in gene expression due to age in the bovine fibroblast model while also creating the first descriptive study of the bovine fibroblast methylome and its potential role in altering the innate immune response within an individual over time.

RESULTS
fibroblast challenge with lps and epigenetic modification
fibroblasts isolated from  <dig> dairy heifers at ~ <dig> and  <dig> months of age have previously been described as showing an age-dependent increase in il- <dig> production in response to lps in vitro  <cit> . to determine if dna methylation may have contributed to this age effect, pairs of fibroblast cultures collected at  <dig> and  <dig> month of age from three mid-level responding animals were selected for epigenetic modification using the demethylating agent aza prior to lps exposure for  <dig> h. neither control nor aza treated cultures produced detectable il- <dig> in the absence of lps. however, in response to lps, young and old cultures displayed greater than 5-fold differences in il- <dig> production , with 5-month-old fibroblasts producing  <dig> ±  <dig> pg/ml in contrast to  <dig>  ±  <dig> pg/ml produced by the older cultures . following aza treatment, the differential response between age groups was abolished  with increased il- <dig> levels of  <dig>  ±  <dig> pg/ml and  <dig>  ±  <dig> pg/ml produced by the cultures from younger and older individuals, respectively. the cultures from  <dig> month old animals in particular displayed much higher  lps-induced il- <dig> production following aza treatment, while the increase in production from 16-month old cultures, though still significant , was more muted. the effect of aza exposure to basal expression levels was not measured, but has previously been reported by us within a similar data set  <cit> .figure  <dig>

rna-seq analysis of young and old response to lps
total rna samples from each of the three animals, collected at two ages, and exposed to lps for  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours were prepared for rna-seq analysis. this analysis generated approximately  <dig> million reads per sample following quality control. alignment to the umd v <dig>  bovine genome yielded 96% of reads falling within alignment parameters and thus an average of  <dig> million reads per sample. at hour  <dig>  under our definition of expression ,  <dig>  targets were detected forming the core transcriptome of the bovine dermal fibroblast under basal conditions. following lps exposure,  <dig>  and  <dig>  targets were detected after  <dig> and  <dig> hours, respectively. in comparison to hour  <dig>  exposure to lps revealed differential gene expression  of  <dig> transcripts at hour  <dig>  and  <dig> transcripts at hour  <dig> . among the genes displaying differential induction due to lps exposure were those involved in the pro-inflammatory response including il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ccl <dig>  tnf, and cxcl <dig> among others . in addition to pro-inflammatory cytokines, the presence of lps induced many type-i interferon related genes, including myxovirus - <dig>  ubiquitin-like gene - <dig>  and interferon induced with helicase c domain - <dig>  among others. this wide array of cytokines and interferon related genes demonstrate the ability of the dermal fibroblasts to recognize and respond to lps.table  <dig>

comparing expression between cultures from younger and older animals revealed  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> differentially expressed genes  at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours post-lps exposure, respectively . of these differentially expressed genes,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> displayed higher levels in 16-month old cultures at hours  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the lower number of significantly, differentially expressed genes at hour  <dig> reflects greater inter-culture variation in response at this time. pathway enrichment analysis using david indicated that at hour  <dig> genes within the inflammatory response  and defense response  pathways were the most strongly implicated as different between cultures due to an animal’s age. similar analysis at hour  <dig> implicated a larger subset of pathways as being differently expressed, however, inflammatory response  and defense response  were still different between the groups. among the genes in these pathways displaying differential expression between cultures from younger and older animals at either  <dig> or  <dig> hours post lps were il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnf, and ccl <dig> among others .figure  <dig>

in addition to genes related to the immune response, those that may be implicated in differential methylation levels were investigated. among these are the family of dnmt genes along with ubiquitin-like containing phd and ring finger domains  <dig>  expression of dnmt3a and 3b, which are involved in de novo methylation, showed no differences between cultures collected from younger and older animals. expression levels of dnmt <dig> and uhrf <dig> however, involved in dna methylation maintenance, were significantly higher in 16-month old cultures cultures at all time points. at hour  <dig>  dnmt <dig> levels were  <dig>  fold higher while uhrf <dig> expression was  <dig>  fold higher. these levels of differential expression were maintained at hours  <dig> and  <dig> post-lps .

confirmation of rna-seq by rt-pcr
several genes were selected for rt-pcr confirmation of expression differences between cultures collected from  <dig> and 16-month old animals that were indicated by rna-seq analysis. il- <dig>  tnf-α, tlr <dig>  and cd <dig> show consistent values in comparison to those from the rna-seq data set. the greatest difference in expression between cultures from the two groups for il- <dig>  and tnf-α  was at hour  <dig> post-lps with  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold higher expression, respectively, in cultures from 16-month old animals. by hour  <dig>  cultures from older animals were still producing higher levels of both il- <dig>  and tnf-α , but the differences between the two groups had been reduced. in contrast, cd <dig>  and tlr <dig>  showed little response to lps, but displayed consistently higher expression in cultures from older animals. for tlr <dig>  cultures from 16-month animals displayed  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  fold higher expression at hours  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  cd <dig> followed a similar pattern, with  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  fold higher expression in 16-month old cultures at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours, respectively. ccl <dig>  and saa <dig>  displayed a strong response to lps in cultures from both groups, but were more highly expressed in the 16-month old group. no differences in expression were seen at hour  <dig>  however cultures from the older animals produced  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold higher transcript levels of ccl <dig> at hours  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. saa <dig> expression was not different between ages at hours  <dig> or  <dig>  but at hour  <dig>  16-month old cultures produced  <dig>  fold more transcripts. the gene expression values generated by rt-pcr were all in general agreement with rna-seq data, validating the transcriptomic results.figure  <dig>

mira-seq
the  <dig> mira-seq samples resulted in an average of approximately  <dig> million reads per library following quality control. alignment to the umd v <dig>  bovine genome yielded 96% of reads falling within alignment parameters and an average of  <dig> million mapped reads per sample. the genome was analyzed by construction of sequential 3kb windows in which the read count between cultures from the two age groups were compared. analysis of the 3kb genome scan yielded  <dig> regions that showed significantly different levels of methylation between groups . of these differentially methylated regions ,  <dig> displayed higher methylation levels in the cultures from 5-month old animals, while  <dig> indicated higher methylation in cultures from 16-month old animals. of the  <dig> dmrs displaying higher methylation levels in 5-month old cultures,  <dig> were found at least partially within an annotated gene while  <dig> of the  <dig> dmrs showing higher methylation in 16-month old cultures were within annotated genes . no differences were seen between cultures from the two groups however at the level of promoter methylation, as determined by our definition of − <dig> bp to +  <dig> bp from transcription start site. mira-seq data was also used to construct a heat map of the bovine fibroblast methylome using the circos software package to illustrate the genome-wide nature of dna methylation .table  <dig>

the role of dna methylation on gene expression
the association between methylation levels within a gene body or gene promoter region and that gene’s levels of expression was analyzed by fisher’s exact test. mira-seq values for a gene body or gene promoter were plotted against rna-seq expression levels at  <dig> h post-lps. each data point was binned as either being a high or low, with a gating value of reads per kilobase per million matched reads  = <dig> or rpkm =  <dig>  for rna-seq and mira-seq, respectively. analysis of the relationship between promoter methylation level and that gene’s subsequent expression level showed that the two values were significantly  dependent upon one another, and indicating a strong inverse relationship between gene promoter dna methylation and gene expression . the relationship between gene body methylation levels and that gene’s expression levels were also significantly  dependent upon one another, though to a smaller extent than promoter methylation . the 8-hour time point was selected for presentation as this offered the period with the greatest number of genes showing high expression levels as analyzed by edger. analysis of the  <dig> and 2-hour post-lps times gave similar results .figure  <dig>

dna methylation levels were also measured in relation to genomic region. methylation was measured as rpkm in gene promoters, gene bodies, or intergenic regions and revealed that promoter regions have significantly less methylation than gene body or intergenic regions while these two showed no difference from one another .

discussion
the ability of an individual to recognize and respond to bacterial components such as lps during an infection plays a critical role in host defense  <cit> . previous work has suggested that neonates are deficient in innate immune responsiveness in comparison to adults  <cit>  however these studies utilized mixed-cell models and were subject to highly variable responses. in using bovine fibroblast cultures, we are able to examine a single population of cells isolated from the same animal at different times, but cryopreserved and once revived, exposed to lps in side by side wells, eliminating much of the technical and genetic variability seen in these previous studies. a broader understanding of the regulated development of the innate immune response within an animal would potentially allow the application of this knowledge to determining factors that may be producing variability between animals in their response to different pathogens.

the goals of this study were to further our previous observation of age-dependent differential gene expression in response to lps, and to determine what role dna methylation may be playing in this process. previously we had found that fibroblast cultures from the same individual but collected at either five or sixteen months of age showed distinct differences in their ability to produce il- <dig> in response to lps, with the cultures from older animals displaying a more hyper-responsive phenotype  <cit> . in addition, we found that variability in the response between individuals could be abolished with the exposure of cultures to aza, a global demethylating agent, thus implicating dna-methylation as a factor contributing to the variation  <cit> . in the current experiment, we expand on these results and explored the bovine transcriptome to fully describe age-dependent differences in gene expression following lps exposure.

differential response to lps due to age
rna-seq data showed a great deal of differential expression between cultures from younger and older animals, predominantly cytokine and chemokines previously shown to play an important role in the resolution of bacterial infections such as e. coli mastitis  <cit> . in addition, tlr <dig>  the extracellular receptor of lps, as well as cd <dig>  an important co-receptor in the tlr <dig> signaling pathway  <cit>  were differentially expressed. the identification of lps recognition genes suggests that cultures from older animals are more readily able to detect danger signals by the binding of pamps. subunits of the nf-κb complex, namely p <dig> and p <dig> showed higher expression  in 16-month old cultures  <dig> hours post-lps exposure, but were not differentially expressed due to age at  <dig> or  <dig> hours post-lps.

another cytokine of interest is il-1α, which can have a strong autocrine effect on cells producing it  <cit> . of interest is the fact that cultures from older animals produced  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold higher levels than cultures from young animals at  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-lps respectively. intracellular il-1α has been linked to increased sensitivity to inflammatory stimuli by nf-κb and ap <dig> suggesting that it plays an important role in the modulation of the inflammatory response  <cit> . this correlates with related research showing responsiveness to lps exposure in airway epithelia of rhesus monkeys, as measured by il- <dig> protein production as well as il-1α transcript, increased in an age dependent manner  <cit> . research on the response to lps in human monocytes and dendritic cells confirmed an increase in the tlr signaling response with age as responsiveness of infants increased over time reaching adult levels within one year of age  <cit> . the gene expression data presented here, along with the work conducted by others suggests that individuals undergo a distinct maturation of response to lps.

temporal response to lps
the rna-seq data also presents a comprehensive view of the temporal aspects of the lps response. there are several hundred genes displaying age-dependent differential expression at hour  <dig>  presenting a picture of the basal variation in expression within an individual due to age. after  <dig> h of lps exposure there is a marked reduction in the absolute number of differentially expressed genes due to high levels of variability across the cultures sampled. this would appear to indicate that within the first two hours of lps exposure, the machinery controlling gene expression is in flux limiting discernable bias between young and old cultures in the speed in which they responded. however, by  <dig> hours post-lps, variability within age groups had been reduced and a greater number of significant differences are seen between the cultures. a similar look at the effects of time on the transcriptome of bovine mammary epithelial cells in response to lps showed low levels of differential expression due to treatment at an early time point  in comparison to a later time , demonstrating that the early response to lps may be more affected by rapid changes in gene expression making it difficult to generate statistical significance between groups  <cit> .

expression of dna methylation-associated genes
rna-seq analysis also highlighted differences in genes involved in the maintenance of dna methylation. cultures from older animals showed higher levels of expression of dnmt <dig> the catalytic methyltransferase enzyme responsible for the addition of the methyl group onto an unmethylated cytosine residue  <cit> . expression levels were also elevated in 16-month old cultures cultures for uhrf <dig>  this gene product identifies hemi-methylated dna following mitosis, recruits dnmt <dig> to the site, and physically flips the methylcytosine residue from the parent strand out of the double helix to sterically allow access of dnmt <dig> to the demethylated daughter strand  <cit> . the lower levels of dnmt <dig> and uhrf <dig> expression in the cultures from younger animals potentially suggest these cultures may be less engaged in high fidelity maintenance of methylation levels. in contrast, cultures from older animals, having gone through a major developmental shift, are now expressing higher levels of both genes in an effort to maintain dna methylation. however, differences in dna methylation due to differential expression of dnmt <dig> and uhrf <dig> would potentially occur as minor changes rather than active, wholesale modifications in dna methylation status.

the role of methylation in the development of the innate immune response is limited
the innate immune response in intestinal epithelial cultures had previously been linked to dna methylation of the nf-κb inhibitor iκbα as measured by production of il- <dig> following tnf-α exposure  <cit> . in our experiments the relative increase in lps-induced il- <dig> response following aza treatment was much greater in fibroblasts from younger individuals. this eliminated the differences seen between the cultures due to age in the absence of aza, suggesting that dna methylation plays an important role in the development of the immune response. to more directly determine where dna methylation was changing over time within individuals we performed mira-seq on dna from fibroblast cultures established from skin biopsies collected from three animals at two ages.

while rna-seq data showed major changes in the transcriptome of an individual due to age, mira-seq analysis of the bovine methylome showed fewer alterations than expected. our methylation analysis identified only twenty 3kb regions that were differentially methylated between younger and older individuals. while our comparison within individuals showed little statistically significant changes in methylation levels, this was not due to high variability between individuals. this would appear to indicate that there is a limited change in methylation seen within an individual over the 11-month period investigated within this study. while highly variable methylation levels have been reported in healthy human populations there has been a more limited description of methylation differences within individuals  <cit> . the results from our data suggest that there are a restricted number of wholesale age-dependent changes in the fibroblast methylome that can be detected by the mira-seq analysis. however in light of the results following aza exposure it appears that more subtle changes, not detectable by mira-seq, are occurring that affect the innate immune response. dna methylation quantification by mira-seq has been shown to be less sensitive due to the nature of the assay in comparison to other methods, including reduced representation bisulfite sequencing and whole genome bisulfite sequencing, which would limit the ability of our study to detect any minor changes in methylation levels  <cit> .

a limitation of the current study is the low-resolution nature of mira-seq. exposure of cultures to aza demonstrated that dna methylation is playing a role in the development in the immune response by rescuing the phenotype of young cultures. while mira-seq allows for an overall visualization of the methylome and can discern differences in overall quantity of methylated cpgs down to approximately a  <dig> bp resolution, subtle methylation patterns are missed. this is problematic as regions altered by just a few cpg dinucleotides have been shown to have appreciable effects on gene expression  <cit> . previous studies that successfully found differences in methylation due to development did so with a single base pair resolution  <cit> . in addition, work conducted in human epidermal tissues found that the overall methylome was relatively stable within an individual over time, and alterations were limited to minor, local changes which again would be lost in our analysis  <cit> . future studies would benefit from an increase in the resolution of the analysis technique.

the role of methylation on bovine fibroblast gene expression
mira-seq data allowed for the construction of a genome-wide dna methylation heat map. this map, the first built for the bovine fibroblast methylome, displayed dense regions of methylation interspersed throughout all of the genome. as a composite of the six mira-seq libraries created, we are able to see regions of methylation likely playing major regulatory roles in fibroblast gene expression and differentiation. while there is currently a dearth of information on the methylation status of different bovines tissues, the construction of the fibroblast methylome is an important first step towards a comparative analysis of methylation across cell types within the bovine system.

mira-seq analysis of our samples was able to confirm several important phenomena seen previously in other target species in terms of dna methylation’s relationship to gene expression, and the non-random placement of methylated cpg dinucleotides across the genome. our data reaffirmed the relationship between gene expression and methylation levels in that heavily methylated genes had a significant tendency towards lower expression levels  <cit> . in addition, our data suggested that the placement of methylation along dna is not a random process, but biased in relation to dna sequences with distinct functions. more specifically, methylation levels are clearly depleted in the promoter region of genes. analysis also showed no differences in methylation levels between gene and intergenic regions, suggesting that the promoter region of a gene is highly sensitive to methylation and the one most highly regulated in terms of de novo dna methylation, confirming what has been previously reported  <cit> .

while rna-seq technology was able to define major differences in the recognition and response of bovine dermal fibroblasts to lps, data investigating the role of dna methylation in this process was inconclusive. the results from this investigation would suggest that major regulatory changes are occurring within the fibroblasts of individuals due to age, potentially due to differential levels of methylation, or a change in the sensitivity to dna methylation due to age. as these genes have demonstrated the ability to be regulated due to age alone, it is possible to determine biomarkers from this study to identify malleable candidate genes that can potentially be manipulated to produce a more ideal phenotype. while our results focused on the innate immune response, it would seem likely that many cellular processes are undergoing similar alterations during development. in addition, our data using aza as a global de-methylation agent points to dna methylation as a major player in the alteration of cellular responsiveness to lps. a mira-seq-based genome-wide scan of methylation however was able to find only a handful of candidate regions differentially methylated due to age. these regions require further investigation with a more sensitive tool for measuring methylation levels on a larger sample size.

CONCLUSIONS
the lps-induced transcriptome of bovine dermal fibroblasts is greatly altered due to age, with epigenetic regulation playing a potentially important role. using multiple cultures from single individual would appear to give researchers an ideal model for investigating not only the role of aging in disease but also general mechanisms controlling the innate immune response. by investigating effectors altering lps responsiveness, this data may be applicable to finding variations within a population in relation to variation in phenotypic response to pathogens.
