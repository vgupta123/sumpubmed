BACKGROUND
cotton is the major source of natural fibers used in the textile industry. apart from its economic importance, the cotton fiber provides a unique single-celled model system to study cell elongation and cell wall biogenesis in the absence of cell division  <cit> . cotton fiber development consists of four distinct but overlapping stages, including fiber initiation, elongation, secondary cell wall biosynthesis, and maturation  <cit> . each cotton fiber is a single cell that initiates from the epidermis of the outer integument of the ovules at or just prior to anthesis  <cit> . fiber elongation starts on the day of anthesis and continues for about 3 weeks before the cells switch to intensive secondary cell wall cellulose synthesis. lint fibers of the economically important gossypium hirsutum generally grow about 30–40 mm in length. during peak elongation fiber cells can increase in length at rates of 2 mm per day or more depending on environment and genotype  <cit> . the fiber cells elongate up to  <dig> fold during 3 weeks which makes them the fastest growing and longest single cell known in higher plants  <cit> . understanding the molecular basis of fiber elongation would provide a means for cotton breeders and researchers to improve the fiber length while maintaining yield and other cotton characteristics.

genetic mutants are useful tools for studying the molecular mechanisms of fiber development. our laboratory uses two short fiber mutants, ligon lintless- <dig> and ligon lintless- <dig>  as a model system to study fiber elongation  <cit> . both li <dig> and li <dig> are monogenic and dominant mutations, resulting in an extreme reduction in the length of lint fiber to approximately 6 mm on mature seeds  <cit> . both mutations are located in the dt subgenome of g. hirsutum: the li <dig> gene is on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , whereas the li <dig> gene is on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . cytological studies of cotton ovules did not reveal much difference between mutants and their near-isogenic wt lines during initiation and early elongation up to  <dig> dpa  <cit> . in a fiber developmental study kohel and co-authors observed that the elongation pattern is similar and restricted in both, li <dig> and li <dig> fibers  <cit> . however, unlike the normal morphological growth of the li <dig> plants, the li <dig> mutant exhibits pleiotropy in the form of severely stunted and deformed plants in both the homozygous dominant and heterozygous state  <cit> . the near-isogenic lines  of li <dig> and li <dig> with the elite upland cotton variety dp <dig> previously used in our research  <cit>  provide an excellent model system to study mechanism of fiber elongation.

in our previous report we used a microarray approach to identify common genes related to fiber elongation, those with altered expression as a result of the li <dig> and li <dig> mutations, growing in the field and a greenhouse  <cit> . we found a relatively small number;  <dig> genes were differentially regulated in both short fiber mutants, which may be due to limitations of microarray technology. rna-seq offers a larger dynamic range of quantification, reduced technical variability, and higher accuracy for distinguishing and quantifying expression levels of homeologous copies than microarray  <cit> . rna-seq can provide a more comprehensive and accurate transcriptome analysis of cotton fiber development by using the reference genome sequence of gossypium raimondii ulbr.  <cit> .

in this study we used a rna-seq approach for the same goal: to determine fiber elongation related genes affected in both mutants growing in the field and a greenhouse. we found a larger number of differentially regulated genes common to both mutants, and from those the major intrinsic proteins were significantly over-represented among the down regulated genes. we measured the osmolality and concentrations of major osmotic solutes in sap of fiber cells. although the osmolality and the concentrations of soluble sugars were less in saps of both short fiber mutants than in wt the concentrations of k+ and malic acid were significantly higher in saps of mutants than in wt during rapid elongation time. the higher concentrations of malic acid and ions suggest limited uptake of water into fiber cells of mutants that can be result of down regulation of major intrinsic proteins.

RESULTS
sources of variability in rna-seq data
we examined genome-wide gene expression in elongating cotton fiber cells at  <dig> dpa in li <dig>  li <dig> mutants and wt under different growing conditions, in the field and greenhouse. the time point  <dig> dpa was selected because our earlier research revealed significant transcript and metabolite changes between the li <dig> and wt nils during this time of fiber development  <cit> . approximately  <dig>  billion 100 bp reads from  <dig> libraries, including  <dig> libraries from field grown plants  and  <dig> libraries from greenhouse grown plants , were trimmed with sickle  <cit>  and mapped to transcripts from the g. raimondii genome reference sequence  <cit> . the results of mapping reads are provided in additional file  <dig> 

principal component analysis  was applied to explore relationships in gene expression among the samples. according to pca, the samples from the near-isogenic lines and from the same lines growing in the field and a greenhouse are separated, indicating effects of the mutations and growth conditions on gene expression . to further investigate the proportion of variation in gene expression explained by each factor, a principal variance components analysis  was run on the same data set. this approach first reduces data dimensionality with pca, and then fits a mixed linear model to each principal component with variance components analysis . the largest source of variability in fiber transcriptome was the variance component l , whereas the variance component e  explained  <dig> % of the total transcriptional variance .figure  <dig>

differential gene expression analysis
an anova model for gene expression was specified in which the measured level of gene expression in li <dig> and li <dig> under different growth conditions was compared with gene expression in corresponding wt. the anova analysis of transcript data is provided in additional file  <dig>  we found that  <dig>  genes were significantly  up-regulated in field grown li <dig> fibers, whereas only  <dig>  genes were up-regulated in field grown li <dig> fibers and  <dig>  genes were up-regulated in greenhouse grown li <dig> fibers . the largest amount of down-regulated genes  <dig>  was detected in field grown li <dig> fibers, whereas  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were down-regulated in field and greenhouse grown li <dig> fibers, consequently. only small portions of these genes were common among up-regulated  and down-regulated  in all tested conditions by anova model . in the following gene set enrichment analysis we focused only on these common genes since our objective was to identify fiber elongation related genes common between short fiber mutants growing in the field and a greenhouse.figure  <dig>

mapman ontology was used for gene set enrichment analysis  <cit> . two main categories  were overrepresented among up-regulated genes and five main categories  were overrepresented among down-regulated genes in li1- li <dig> developing fibers. figure 2b shows only sub-categories from the above mentioned main categories which are significantly  overrepresented in the li <dig> – li <dig> fiber transcriptomes. particularly, nadh dehydrogenase, cytochrome c and alternative oxidase were significantly  overrepresented sub-categories in electron transport, whereas abc transporters and transport of amino acids were overrepresented sub-categories li <dig> – li <dig> up-regulated genes. the most significantly  overrepresented sub-categories in li <dig> – li <dig> down-regulated genes were: major intrinsic proteins and transport of sulphate in transport category; and the plastocyanin –like enzyme family.

genes categorized into transport functional category were overrepresented among up-regulated and down-regulated pools of genes; however, proportions of gene family members of transporters were different among up-regulated or down-regulated genes. significantly up-regulated and down-regulated transporters in li <dig> – li <dig> mutants growing in the field and a greenhouse are shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  major intrinsic proteins, sulphate and phosphate transporters were present only among pool of down-regulated genes, whereas proportions of amino acids and abc transporters were significantly higher among pool of up-regulated genes. the sugars transporters were not significantly more abundant among up-regulated than down-regulated genes.table  <dig>

major intrinsic proteins
major intrinsic proteins or aquaporins were one of the most significantly  over-represented gene family among down-regulated genes in li <dig> – li <dig> fibers. aquaporins facilitate the efficient transport of water and other small molecules across membranes in plants and other organisms  <cit> . cotton aquaporins form a large family of proteins phylogenetically divided into five subfamilies including: plasma membrane intrinsic proteins , tonoplast intrinsic proteins , nod26-like intrinsic proteins , small basic intrinsic proteins , and the recently identified x  intrinsic proteins   <cit> . to assess which subfamily members of aquaporins were affected by li <dig> – li <dig> mutations: first, we conducted phylogenetic analysis of g. raimondii genes annotated as aquaporins; and second, evaluated their expression level in li <dig> – li <dig> developing fibers. the analyzed g. raimondii aquaporins clustered into five main clades  representing the above mentioned subfamilies . the members of subfamilies pip , tip  and nip  were down-regulated in li <dig> – li <dig> developing fibers . the most highly induced aquaporins in wt fibers, for which transcript levels were dramatically reduced in li <dig> – li <dig> mutants, were tested by rt-qpcr. in most cases results of rt-qpcr analysis were consistent with results of rna-seq analysis . there were a number of aquaporins which showed increased transcript level only in greenhouse grown li <dig> , indicating interactive response to li <dig> mutation and growth conditions. however, relative expression level of those genes was considerably less compared with wt expressed aquaporins as shown in figure  <dig> .figure  <dig>

osmotic concentrations and solutes in saps of li <dig> and li <dig> fiber cells
we measured the osmotic concentration and calculated osmotic pressure of the sap of cotton fiber cells. the sap solution represents the average osmotic concentration of the vacuole, the cytoplasm, and the apoplast  of the fiber cells. in fiber cells the vacuole occupies approximately 90% of the cell volume  <cit> ; therefore the measured osmotic concentration values largely represent the solute concentration of the vacuoles. the calculated osmotic pressure in sap of wt fibers was steadily high during rapid fiber elongation, at  <dig> –  <dig> dpa, and significantly dropped during the transition to the cell wall biosynthesis stage . the pattern of osmotic pressure in sap of li <dig> fibers was similar with pattern in wt; although the osmotic pressure was significantly lower  at  <dig> –  <dig> dpa. in sap of li <dig> fibers the osmotic pressure was significantly lower than in wt at  <dig> –  <dig> dpa, but higher at  <dig> dpa.figure  <dig>

soluble sugars, k+, and malate are major active solutes in elongating fibers, to which are often attributed 80% of the fiber sap osmolality  <cit> . to assess which osmotic solutes altered in the li <dig> and li <dig> developing fibers we measured the concentrations of sugars, malic acid, and ions in fiber sap solutions . concentrations of hexoses  were significantly less in sap of li <dig> and li <dig> fibers compared to wt during rapid fiber cell expansion . the level of sucrose was low during elongation at  <dig> –  <dig> dpa in sap of all near-isogenic lines; however, at  <dig> –  <dig> dpa the concentration of sucrose significantly increased in li <dig> and li <dig>  but not in wt fiber. surprisingly, the concentrations of malic acid and k+ were significantly  higher in sap of li <dig> and li <dig> fibers comparing to wt during elongation . the concentrations of na+ were not significantly different in saps of li <dig>  li <dig> and wt. we also measured the concentrations of ca+ <dig> and phosphorus, which were significantly higher in saps of mutants compared to wt.figure  <dig>

discussion
experimental design for identification of fiber elongation related genes
in this study we compared the transcriptomes of developing fibers of two short fiber mutants and their wt nil growing in the field and a greenhouse. the mutated genes of the li <dig> and the li <dig> are yet to be discovered. a defect in the li <dig> gene affected a number of traits , while the defect in li <dig> gene affected only fiber length. therefore, the li <dig> and li <dig>  most likely, are different types of genes; their alterations interrupt different parts of a complex biosynthetic process, but in both cases cause a short fiber phenotype. both li <dig> and li <dig> mutations have an enormous effect on the fiber transcriptomes; the largest source of variability in the fiber transcriptome data was due to mutations . however, altered expression of many genes in li <dig> – li <dig> transcriptomes can be result of chain-reactions to adverse effects of the causative mutation, and is not necessary directly related to fiber elongation process. also it is known that many fiber-related genes are environmentally regulated  <cit> ; in our experiment the environmental factor contributed  <dig> % to the data variability . therefore, to reduce noise in the data we selected common regulated genes between li1/wt and li2/wt grown in the field and li2/wt grown in a greenhouse. this approach allowed the identification of transcripts directly related to fiber elongation process regardless of far downstream effects of the mutations and environmental conditions.

gene set enrichment analysis
we found a large number of differentially expressed genes common to both mutants . to gain insight into biological processes altered by li <dig> – li <dig> mutations we used mapman ontology for gene set enrichment analysis. consistent with our previous microarray study, mitochondrial electron transport functional category was over-represented among up-regulated genes in short fiber mutants  <cit> . enrichment of the cell wall functional category was expected among down-regulated genes and described for li <dig> and li <dig> in our previous reports  <cit> . however, strong down-regulation of major intrinsic proteins in short fiber mutants was not noticed before in our microarray studies, probably due to limitations of microarray techniques. here, we found that the major intrinsic proteins were the most down-regulated gene family in both short fiber mutants; their role in osmoregulation of li <dig> – li <dig> fibers is discussed below.

osmoregulation in short fiber mutants
the rapid expansion of fiber cells requires high turgor pressure and cell wall relaxation  <cit> . the force of turgor pressure is related to the osmotic potential and to the transport coefficient for water uptake  <cit> . the maintenance of sufficient osmoticum to compensate for dilution effects resulting from the influx of water is an important component of sustainable cell expansion  <cit> . in the fiber sap of short fiber mutants we detected significantly lower osmotic pressure than in wt. the reduced osmotic pressure in li <dig> – li <dig> may not be sufficient to maintain rapid and sustainable cell expansion and may cause short fiber phenotype. soluble sugars, k+ and malic acid are considered as major active solutes in rapidly expanding fiber cells  <cit> . we detected lower concentrations of glucose and fructose in sap of short fiber mutants than in wt that correlate with lower osmotic pressure, suggesting sugars are the main solutes to positively impact turgor in fiber cells. sucrose was almost undetectable in mutants and wt fibers during the rapid elongation phase . in developing fiber cells, sucrose is degraded into hexoses by sucrose synthase in the cytoplasm and acid invertase in the vacuole  <cit> . we tested the expression levels of sugars transporters in mutants because their regulation may cause a reduced supply of sugars in developing fibers. however, the number of up-regulated sugars transporters in li <dig> – li <dig> was higher than down regulated:  <dig> versus  <dig> genes, correspondingly . therefore, the transport of sugars is unlikely altered in short fiber mutants. in our previous report we observed significant reductions in the levels of detected free sugars, sugar alcohols, sugar acids, and sugar phosphates in the li <dig> metabolome; also biological processes associated with carbohydrate biosynthesis were significant down-regulated in the li <dig> transcriptome  <cit> . consequently, detection of low amount of sugars in sap of li <dig> – li <dig> fibers might be the result of reduced de novo synthesis of sugars in mutants.

the driving force for the transport and accumulation of ions into the protoplast and vacuole is provided by the plasma membrane and vacuolar h+-atpases  <cit> . we did not detect the plasma membrane and vacuolar h+-atpases among common li <dig> – li <dig> up-regulated or down-regulated pools of genes. numbers of calcium, potassium and other metal transporters were not significantly different between pools of up-regulated and down-regulated genes in short fiber mutants; except for sulphate and phosphate transporters which were present among down-regulated genes only . thus, ion transport in li <dig> – li <dig> is unlikely to be affected by the mutations and proceeds normally as in wild type plants. the higher concentrations of malic acid, k+ and other inorganic ions detected in sap of li <dig> – li <dig> can be explained by reduced influx of water into fiber cells of mutants . since malic acid and k+  cannot restore the balance of water uptake into developing li <dig> – li <dig> fibers, there is another factor, which might be crucial for osmoregulation of cotton fibers – the major intrinsic proteins .figure  <dig> 
a possible mechanism of termination of fiber elongation in the
li

and
li

mutants. the high osmotic pressure in fiber cell of wt and high level of expression of aquaporins facilitates influx of water that contributes to the rapid fiber elongation. the higher accumulation of ions in fiber cells of li
 <dig> – li
 <dig> may be the result of limited uptake of water. the reduced influx of water  causes the reduced fiber elongation in the li
 <dig> – li
 <dig> mutants.



the major intrinsic proteins or aquaporins were the most overrepresented gene family among down-regulated genes in both short fiber mutants . the expression level of some members of pips and tips at  <dig> dpa of fiber development in wt was enormous, up to  <dig>  reads . it has been indicated in a number of studies that the osmotic water permeability  is controlled by the activity of aquaporins. for instance, javot and co-authors showed that arabidopsis pip2; <dig> is highly expressed in several root cell types, and that, by comparison to wt plants, the hydraulic conductivity of corresponding knock-out mutants  was reduced by 14%  <cit> . the hydraulic conductivity of pip1; <dig> mutants and pip2; <dig> and pip2; <dig> double mutants was decreased by 20% and 40% respectively, compared to that of wt  <cit> . a link between aquaporins and cell growth has also been shown in different species. virus-induced silencing of rose pip2; <dig> resulted in a reduction in size of cells and petal expansion  <cit> . over-expression of a cauliflower tip1-gfp fusion in tobacco suspension cells or of ginseng tip in arabidopsis leaves led to an increase in cell size  <cit> . vacuole regeneration and cell expansion were accelerated in protoplast prepared from by- <dig> cells over-expressing the nttip1; <dig>  <cit> . knockdown of expression of ghpip <dig> genes by rna interference in g. hirsutum markedly inhibited fiber elongation  <cit> . thus, the reduced expression of aquaporins in short fiber mutants may reduce the influx of water into fiber cells and slow down the elongation process .

CONCLUSIONS
here, we used an rna-seq approach to determine common fiber elongation related genes in developing fibers of li <dig> and li <dig> mutants growing in the field and a greenhouse. we found that the aquaporins were the most down-regulated gene family in both short fiber mutants. the osmolality and concentrations of soluble sugars were less in saps of li <dig> – li <dig>  whereas the concentrations of malic acid, k+ and other detected ions were significantly higher in saps of mutants than in wt. these results suggest that higher accumulation of ions in fiber cells, reduced osmotic pressure and low expression of aquaporins, may contribute to the cessation of fiber elongation in li <dig> and li <dig> short-fiber mutants.
