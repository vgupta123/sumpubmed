BACKGROUND
sweetpotato  is a hexaploid  dicot and belongs to the family of convolvulaceae. it is one of the world's important food crops, especially in developing countries. the tuberous roots of sweetpotato are usually used as staple food, animal feed, industrial material or raw material for alcohol production. according to the food and agriculture organization  statistics, the world production of sweetpotato in  <dig> was more than  <dig> million tons, and the majority came from china, with a production of around  <dig> million tons from about  <dig>  million hectares  <cit> . due to the high sink potential of the tuberous root, sweetpotato has one of the highest dry matter productivity rates among crops  <cit> . in addition to its agricultural importance, the sweetpotato tuberous root, involved in carbohydrate storage and vegetative propagation, is also a unique organ, which has the value of biological research for organogenesis and evolution. therefore, understanding the processes regulating the root formation and development is of particular importance. during the last decade, a large number of transcriptomic and genomic sequences became available in model organisms, such as arabidopsis, antirrhinum and rice, which have greatly improved the understanding of the complexity of growth and development in higher plants. for sweetpotato, a total of  <dig>   <dig> est sequences have been deposited in genbank database . after trimming and assembly, only  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons were obtained . however, the tuberous root formation and development of sweetpotato are complex biological processes involving morphogenesis as well as dry matter accumulation. the publicly available data are not sufficient for elucidating the molecular mechanisms controlling the traits of interest, and moreover, with traditional methods sequencing of these randomly selected cdna clones from various tissues often has insufficient coverage of less-abundant transcripts, which usually play irreplaceable functions. in addition, to date, only about  <dig> ssr markers were developed for sweetpotato  <cit> . est collections will also facilitate the development of molecular markers for further genetic research in this and related species. therefore, extensive genomic and transcriptomic sequence data are needed for sweetpotato, which can be used to discover new genes related to tuberous root formation and development, and can also make it possible to construct high density microarrays for further characterization of gene expression profiles during these processes.

however, given that cultivated sweetpotato is a hexaploid outbreeding species with a large genome   <cit>  and a high degree of heterozygosity, the prohibitive costs associated with sequencing and assembling such a large and complex genome make it infeasible to consider whole genome sequencing in the near future. fortunately, transcriptome sequencing is an attractive alternative to the whole genome sequencing. it is well known that the majority of most eukaryotic genomes are composed of non-coding dna, and transcribed sequences excluding introns contain a high content of functional information  <cit> . furthermore, large collections of ests have proven invaluable for functional genomics and molecular marker development  <cit> . currently, however, traditional sequencing methods for the generation of ests require costly and time-consuming approaches involving cdna library construction, cloning, and labor intensive sanger sequencing. the newly developed high throughput sequencing technology, i.e. next generation sequencing , including the roche/ <dig> genome sequencer flx instrument, the abi solid system, and the illumina genome analyser, is a powerful and cost-efficient tool for advanced research in many areas, including re-sequencing, microrna expression profiling, dna methylation, especially de novo transcriptome sequencing for non-model organisms  <cit> . over the past several years, ngs has greatly accelerated our understanding of the complexity of gene expression, regulation and networks in model and non-model organisms. though the transcriptome sequencing for non-model organisms using ngs was almost confined to  <dig> pyrosequencing due to its longer read length compared with the other two platforms  <cit> , it is noteworthy that a draft genome sequence for the giant panda has been generated and assembled successfully using only illumina genome analyser sequencing technology  <cit> . recently whitefly transcriptome was also characterized using this short read sequencing platform  <cit> .

in the present study, we utilized illumina paired-end sequencing technology to characterize the root transcriptome of sweetpotato and to develop est-derived ssr markers. non-normalized cdna collections from different types of roots were used to generate a broad survey of genes associated with tuberous root formation and development. to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first exploration to characterize the root transcriptome of sweetpotato through the analysis of large-scale transcript sequences resulting from illumina paired-end sequencing. in addition to offering valuable sequence resource to sweet potato community, our objective was also to provide an efficient, inexpensive and reliable approach for transcriptome sequencing that can be readily adopted by researchers studying non-model organisms.

RESULTS
illumina paired-end sequencing and de novo assembly
with the purpose of generating a broad survey of genes associated with tuberous root formation and development, rna was extracted from fibrous roots, pencil roots and tuberous roots at three developmental stages. using illumina paired-end sequencing technology, each sequencing feature can yield  <dig> Ã—  <dig> bp independent reads from either end of a dna fragment. in this study, a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw sequencing reads with the length of  <dig> bp were generated from a  <dig> bp insert library. an assembler, soapdenovo http://soap.genomics.org.cn developed specifically for use with next-generation short-read sequences, was employed for de novo assembly. after stringent quality check and data cleaning, approximately  <dig> million high-quality reads were obtained with  <dig> % q <dig> bases . based on the high quality reads, a total of  <dig>  contigs were assembled with an average length of  <dig> bp. the length of contigs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp. contigs with length more than  <dig> bp accounted for  <dig> % .

with paired-end reads, it is possible to identify contigs derived from the same transcript as well as the distances between these contigs. we, therefore, mapped the reads back to contigs, and then with paired-end information joined contigs into scaffolds using "n" to represent unknown nucleotides between each two contigs. as a result,  <dig>  scaffolds were obtained with an average length of  <dig> bp . scaffolds with the length ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp accounted for  <dig> %. although  <dig> % scaffolds had not a gap at all , roughly  <dig>  mb gaps  remained unclosed.

to further shorten the remaining gaps, we gathered the paired-end reads with one end mapped on the unique contig and the other end located in the gap region and performed local assembly with the unmapped end to fill in the small gaps within the scaffolds. such sequences containing least ns and not being extended on either end were defined as unigenes. in this step, more than half of gaps were filled, and only  <dig>  mb gaps  remained unclosed. the gap distribution for unigenes was shown in figure  <dig>  finally the de novo assembly yielded  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of  <dig> bp and a total length of  <dig>  mb . the length of assembled unigenes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp. there were  <dig>  unigenes  with length varying from  <dig> to  <dig> bp,  <dig>  unigenes  in the length range of  <dig> to  <dig> bp, and  <dig>  unigenes  with length more than  <dig> bp .

to evaluate the quality and coverage of the assembled unigenes, all the usable sequencing reads were realigned to the unigenes using soapaligner  <cit> , allowing up to  <dig> base mismatches. the sequencing depth ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  folds, with an average of  <dig>  folds. about  <dig> % of the unigenes were realigned by more than  <dig> reads,  <dig> % were remapped by more than  <dig> reads, and almost 10% were realigned by more than  <dig> reads . to further assess the extent of transcript coverage provided by unigenes and to evaluate how coverage depth affected the assembly of unigenes, we plotted the ratio of assembled unigene length to a. thaliana ortholog length against coverage depth . most of a. thaliana ortholog coding region can be covered by our individual unigenes, although a large number of deeply covered unigenes failed to cover the complete coding regions of their a. thaliana orthologs. it is worth noting that, to a certain extent, increased coverage depth can result in higher coverage of the coding regions. actually, in many cases, multiple unigenes covered different regions of a. thaliana orthologs. plotting the summed proportion of a. thaliana orthologs covered by all illumina unigenes showed that  <dig> orthologs could be covered by unigenes with a percentage more than 80%, and the cover percentage of around  <dig>  orthologs ranged from 50-80%. additionally, 27% orthologs were covered with only 20% or lower . the results indicated that additional sequencing would be needed for more comprehensive transcriptome coverage.

functional annotation by searching against public databases
for validation and annotation of assembled unigenes, sequence similarity search was conducted against the ncbi non-redundant protein  database and the swiss-prot protein database using blastx algorithm  <cit>  with an e value threshold of 10- <dig>  the results indicated that out of  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>   showed significant similarity to known proteins in nr database and matched  <dig>  unique protein accessions. as expected, the similar percentage was found for the search against swiss-prot database. of all the unigenes,  <dig>   had blast hits in swiss-prot database and matched  <dig>  unique protein accessions. compared with  <cit> , in which only  <dig> % had blast hits in nr database, the higher percentage in this study was partially due to the higher frequency of long sequences in our unigenes   <cit> . as reported by  <cit> , the longer contigs were more likely to have blast matches in the protein databases. our results also showed that 79% of unigenes over  <dig> bp in length had blast matches, whereas only 30% of unigenes shorter than  <dig> bp did . the e-value distribution of the top hits in the nr database revealed that  <dig> % of the mapped sequences showed significant homology , and nearly 20% of the sequences with greater than 80% similarity were found . the e-value and similarity distributions of the top hits in the swiss-prot database had a comparable pattern with 30% and 15% of the sequences possessing significant homology and similarity, respectively . altogether, blast searches identified a total of  <dig>  unique protein accessions, indicating that in this study the illumina paried-end sequencing project generated a substantial fraction of sweetpotato genes.

of all the  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig> were uniquely mapped by more than  <dig>  reads, which represented the most abundant transcripts in sweetpotato root cdna library . since sweetpotato tuberous root contains approximately 70% starch of the total dry weight, it is not surprising that some transcripts encoding the enzymes involved in starch metabolism were highly expressed, such as plant glycogenin-like starch initiation protein  <dig>  adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase beta subunit, granule bound starch synthase i, alpha- <dig>   <dig> glucan phosphorylase l isozyme and beta-amylase  <cit> . besides the high starch content, sweetpotato tuberous root also contains plenty of other components, such as alkaloid and vitamin c . therefore, we also found two transcripts were highly expressed, one encoding the putrescine methyltransferase, which participates in alkaloid biosynthesis  <cit> ; the other encoding the gdp-d-mannose  <dig> -epimerase , which is generally considered to be a key enzyme of the major ascorbate biosynthesis pathway in higher plants through converting gdp-d-mannose to gdp-l-galactose  <cit> . notably, we found an abundant transcript encoding rac-like gtp-binding protein, which was preferentially expressed at the tip of root hairs and believed to be involved in cell polarity control during the actin-dependent tip growth of root hairs  <cit> . some transcripts encoding superoxide dismutase and metallothionein-like protein were also highly expressed, and these enzymes may play a role in the defense system or keeping metal homeostasis or detoxification  <cit> . in addition, abundant transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins and like-sm ribonucleoprotein -related were also identified. however, it is noteworthy that the two most abundant transcripts, which had  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads mapped, respectively, showed no significant similarity to any known gene.

functional classification by go and cog
gene ontology  is an international standardized gene functional classification system which offers a dynamic-updated controlled vocabulary and a strictly defined concept to comprehensively describe the properties of genes and their products in any organism. go has three ontologies: molecular function, cellular component and biological process. on the basis of nr annotation, the blast2go program  <cit>  was used to obtain go annotation for unigenes annotated by nr. then the wego software  <cit>  was used to perform go functional classification for these unigenes. in total,  <dig>  unigenes with blast matches to known proteins were assigned to gene ontology classes with  <dig>  functional terms. of them, assignments to the biological process made up the majority  followed by molecular function  and cellular component .

the assigned functions of unigenes covered a broad range of go categories. under the biological process category, metabolic process  and cellular process  were prominently represented, indicating that some important metabolic activities occur in sweetpotato root. interestingly,  <dig> unigenes were assigned to the pigmentation category. it was also noteworthy that a large number of genes  involved in response to different stimulus. under the category of molecular function, binding  and catalytic  represented the majorities of the category. among the  <dig>  unigenes assigned to the binding part, protein binding  represented the most abundant classification, followed by ion binding , atp binding , dna binding  and rna binding  . for the cellular component category,  <dig>  unigenes were located into intracellular, whereas only a few genes were assigned to extracellular region, macromolecular complex and virion.

the cluster of orthologous groups  database is a database where the orthologous gene products were classified. every protein in cog is assumed to be evolved from an ancestor protein, and the whole database is built on coding proteins with complete genome as well as system evolution relationships of bacteria, algae and eukaryotes. all unigenes were aligned to the cog database to predict and classify possible functions. out of  <dig>  nr hits,  <dig>  sequences were assigned to the cog classifications . among the  <dig> cog categories, the cluster for general function prediction only  represented the largest group, followed by transcription , replication, recombination and repair , posttranslational modification, protein turnover and chaperones , signal transduction mechanisms , carbohydrate transport and metabolism  and translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis , whereas only a few unigenes were assigned to nulcear structure and extracellular structure. in addition,  <dig> unigenes were assigned to secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism .

functional classification by kegg
the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway database records the networks of molecular interactions in the cells, and variants of them specific to particular organisms. pathway-based analysis helps to further understand the biological functions and interactions of genes. firstly, based on a comparison against the kegg database using blastx with an e-value cutoff of <10- <dig>  out of the  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>   had significant matches in the database and were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways. among them,  <dig>  unigenes having enzyme commission  numbers were assigned to the metabolic pathways. as shown in figure 8a, the kegg metabolic pathways contained carbohydrate metabolism, the biosynthesis of secondary metabolite, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism and energy metabolism. in the secondary metabolism,  <dig>  unigenes were classified into  <dig> subcategories, and most of them were mapped to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis, limonene and pinene degradation, and flavonoid biosynthesis . surprisingly, in the kegg map, most enzymes were mapped to the unigenes. these results indicated the active metabolic processes in sweetpotato root, but also implies that a variety of metabolites are synthesized in the root, suggesting that it, besides storing starch, is a valuable food source with various nutrients, such as complex carbohydrates, dietary fiber, beta carotene, vitamins, flavonoid and isoflavonoid, anthocyanin and alkaloid.

in addition to the genes assigned to the metabolism pathways,  <dig>  unigenes were sorted to the genetic information processing involving transcription, translation, folding, sorting, degradation, replication and repair, and about  <dig> unigenes were classified into membrane transport, signal transduction, immune system and environmental adaptation. the results demonstrated the powerful ability of high-throughput sequencing to identify novel genes in non-model organisms, and these annotations also provided a valuable resource for investigating specific processes, functions and pathways involved in root formation and development.

development and characterization of cdna-derived ssr markers
for further assessment of the assembly quality and development of new molecular markers, all of the  <dig>  unigenes generated in this study were used to mine potential microsatellites which were defined as di- to hexanucleotide ssr with a minimum of four repetitions for all motifs. using the misa perl script http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/, a total of  <dig>  potential cssrs were identified in  <dig>  unigenes, of which,  <dig> sequences contained more than  <dig> cssr, and  <dig> cssrs were present in compound form . in order to identify the putative function of genes containing the cssr loci,  <dig>  unigenes were searched against uniprot database http://www.uniprot.org with e-value cutoff less than 10- <dig>  among them,  <dig>  unigenes had blast hits to known proteins in this database. based on the cssr-containing sequences,  <dig> pairs of cssr primers were designed using primer premier  <dig>  . the detailed information of designed primers is shown in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  of the  <dig> designed cssrs,  <dig> were found in the coding regions,  <dig> in the 5' untranslated regions ,  <dig> in the 3' utr and  <dig> in those genes without any hit to known proteins. among the  <dig> primer pairs,  <dig> primer pairs were successful in pcr amplification in cultivated sweetpotato. the remaining  <dig> primers failed to generate pcr products at various annealing temperatures and mg2+ concentrations and would be excluded from further analysis. of the  <dig> working primer pairs,  <dig> amplified pcr products at the expected sizes, and  <dig> primer pairs resulted in larger pcr products than what expected, suggesting that there may be an intron within the amplicons, and pcr products of the other  <dig> primer pairs were smaller than expected, suggesting the occurrence of deletion within the genomic sequences or a lack of specificity or the possibility of assembly errors.

in addition, the frequency, type and distribution of the potential  <dig>  cssrs were also analyzed in this study. the compilation of all cssrs revealed that, on the average, one cssr can be found every  <dig>  kb in unigenes, and the frequency of cssr was  <dig> %. among the  <dig>  cssrs, the di-and tri-nucleotide repeat motifs were the most abundant types , followed by tetra- , penta-  and hexa-nucleotide  repeat motifs. di- to hexa-nucleotide motifs were further analyzed for cssr length . cssr length was mostly distributed from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, accounting for  <dig> % of total cssrs, followed by  <dig> -  <dig> bp length range . there were  <dig> cssrs with length larger than  <dig> bp.

within the searched cssrs,  <dig> motif sequence types were identified, of which, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotide repeat had  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> types, respectively. the ag/ct di-nucleotide repeat was the most abundant motif detected in our cssrs , followed by the motif aag/ctt , at/ta , aat/att , act/atg , agt/atc , ccg/cgg , agg/cct  and ac/gt . the frequency of remaining  <dig> types of motifs accounted for  <dig> % .

discussion
illumina paired end sequencing and assembly
transcriptome sequencing is one of the most important tools for gene discovery. however, large-scale est sequencing using the traditional sanger method is time-consuming and expensive. during the past several years, the ngs technology has become a tremendous approach for high-throughput gene discovery on a genome-wide scale in non-model organisms. in addition to its great improvement of efficiency and speed, ngs platforms can eliminate the bacterial cloning step that can bias the composition of the cdna library. due to its long read length and appearance ahead of the other two platforms, roche gs flx has been the most widely used platform for de novo transcriptome sequencing in many organisms, such as chestnut  <cit> , pine  <cit> , olive  <cit> , ginseng  <cit> , a. thaliana  <cit> , maize  <cit> , artemisia annua  <cit> , fish  <cit> , insects  <cit> , and worms  <cit> . in contrast, illumina transcriptome or genome sequencing was mainly limited to organisms with reference genomes available  <cit> . over the last two years, with the further confirmation that the relatively short reads can be effectively assembled  <cit> , especially with the great advantage of paired-end sequencing  <cit> , the illumina transcriptome or whole genome de novo sequencing and assembly have been successfully used for model  <cit> and non-model organisms  <cit> . consistent with these publications, our results also indicated that relatively short reads from illumina paired-end sequencing can be effectively assembled and used for novel gene discovery and ssr marker development in non-model organism. here, approximately  <dig> million of 75-bp paired-end reads were generated from illumina genome analyzer iix. such great numbers of reads and paired-end information resulted in a relatively high depth of coverage . these sequences also produced longer unigenes  than those assembled in previous studies for example, butterfly   <cit> , eucalyptus grandis   <cit> , coral larval   <cit> , lodegpole pine   <cit> ) and whitefly   <cit> ).

in this study, we also provided evidence that a paired-end strategy had a strong impact on assembly as opposed to single-end approach. during de novo assembly, contigs were assembled from  <dig> bp reads data excluding mate-pair information, however, unigenes were assembled from the same read data combining with the mate-pair information. a comparison between contigs and unigenes revealed that both average and maximum lengths of unigenes were greatly larger than those of contigs, though the number of contigs was more than that of unigenes . this illustrated the critical importance of reads pairs for obtaining high-quality assemblies. the high quality assembled unigenes were validated by a high proportion of unigenes matching to known proteins using blastx and by the efficient pcr amplification of cssr markers developed in our unigenes.

nonetheless, only 40% of reads were assembled into unigenes, which is less than that reported for  <dig> transciptome assemblies . large numbers of un-assembled reads could result from several causes, including the relatively short reads generated by illumina genome analyzer, the assembly options , genes expressed at low levels, repeat regions, and the difficulties with de novo transcriptome assembly caused by the alternative splicing. these high-quality unassembled reads are still a very important sequence resource for sweetpotato. to combine the use of longer reads for example from the flx- <dig> sequencing platform would possibly further improve the de novo assembly.

when we realigned all the usable sequencing reads to the unigenes, a  <dig> Ã— average coverage depth was obtained. however, of the  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>  had a coverage depth less than  <dig>  this is in part due to the drawback to the de bruijn graph approach  <cit> , which is the algorithm used by soapdenovo. in de bruijn approach, the reads are decomposed into k-mers, which maybe cause the loss of information. in a few cases, only partial k-mers from the reads can be used for assembly, leading to assembled sequences that are not supported by the underlying reads. this also implied that the paralogs that share a high level of sequence similarity may have been assembled into one contig because they can not be distinguished due to the short read length and the lack of reference genome.

functional annotation of unigenes
estimating the number of genes and the level of transcript coverage is an important issue for transcriptome sequencing projects, but is difficult in this study due to the lack of a reference genome. using blast, we indirectly evaluated the transcriptome coverage breadth by determining the number of unique genes in our collection. a great number of unigenes could match unique known proteins in public databases, which implied that our illumina paired-end sequencing project yielded a substantial fraction of unique genes from sweetpotato. like  <cit> , if we assumed that the number of genes in sweetpotato was commensurate with that in arabidopsis , our annotated unigenes  would likely represent more than 80% of genes in sweetpotato. a large number of unigenes were assigned to a wide range of gene ontology categories and cog classifications , also indicating that our paired-end sequencing data represented a wide diversity of transcripts. based on the kegg pathway, the well represented pathways were carbohydrate metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolite, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism and energy metabolism . in the secondary metabolism,  <dig>  unigenes were classified into  <dig> different subcategories . these results indicated the active metabolic processes in sweetpotato root development. notably, we also found all of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of brassinosteroid . we estimated that the expression of brassinosteroid biosynthetic genes was lower than that of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of starch and sugar. therefore, these results also strongly suggested that most of the genes involved in the different metabolic processes came into being through high-throughput illumina transcriptome sequencing. furthermore, the unigenes without blast hits likely corresponded to 3' or 5' untranslated regions, non-coding rnas, or short sequences not containing a known protein domain, most of which might represent potential sweetpotato-specific genes. taken together, such large number of sequences and deep depth of coverage can provide sufficient transcriptomic sequence information for discovering novel genes, and also confirm that high throughput illumina paired-end sequencing is an efficient, inexpensive and reliable tool for transcriptome characterization and gene discovery in non-model species. generally speaking, cdna normalization is often used when gene discovery is the primary purpose of sequencing. according to previous publication, there is no real advantage to normalization when thousands of sequences were generated  <cit> . in this study, such deep depth and wide breadth of coverage provided by the powerful illumina paired-end sequencing platform suggested that it was feasible to obviate the need for normalization.

cssr marker identification and characterization
in this study, a total of  <dig> pairs of high quality pcr primers were designed and used for further assessment of the assembly quality. of these,  <dig>  could successfully yield amplicons. among the  <dig> working primer pairs,  <dig> amplified pcr products at the expected sizes, and  <dig> primer pairs resulted in larger or smaller pcr products than what expected, suggesting that there may be an intron or deletion within the amplicons or a lack of specificity, it also can not ruled out the possibility of assembly errors due to the short read length. this result was similar to previous studies in which success rates of 60-90% amplification have been reported  <cit> , and also provided evidence for the quality validation of our assembled unigenes and the possibility of the utility of the cssrs produced in the present study.

as is commonly known, polymorphic ssr markers are important for research involving genetic diversity, relatedness, evolution, linkage mapping, comparative genomics, and gene-based association studies. next generation transcriptome sequencing produces plenty of sequences for molecular marker development. currently there exist only several hundreds genetic markers in sweetpotato. the  <dig>  cssrs identified from our data will provide a wealth of markers for further genetic study. based on these identified cssr-containing sequences, we will design more pcr primers and assess their polymorphism among cultivated and wild ipomoea species and provide a more valuable resource of genetic markers for future research in sweetpotato.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, in addition to the characterization of the root transcriptome of sweetpotato, we achieved some valuable resources for new gene discovery and cssr marker development for further study. many genes generated in the present study will certainly accelerate the understanding of the processes regulating sweetpotato root formation and development. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt using illumina paired-end sequencing technology for sweetpotato root transcriptome de novo sequencing and assembly without reference genome. additionally, in these generated sequences,  <dig>  cssrs were identified and characterized as potential molecular markers. the enormous size and complexity of sweetpotato genome make it essential to develop thousands of molecular markers for the fine-scale mapping of interest traits. thousands of cssr markers produced in this study will enable genetic linkage mapping construction and gene-based association studies. the results demonstrated that illumina paired end sequencing can be used as a fast and cost-effective approach to the gene discovery and molecular marker development for non-model organism, especially those with large genome.
