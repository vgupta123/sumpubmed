BACKGROUND
pathogenic fungi use signal transduction pathways to sense the environment and to adapt quickly to changing conditions. identification of the components that comprise signalling cascades controlling dimorphism in sporothrix schenckii has been of particular interest in our laboratory for years. studying the mechanisms controlling dimorphism in s. schenckii is important for understanding its pathogenicity and the response to the hostile environment encountered in the host  <cit> . dimorphism in s. schenckii as in other pathogenic fungi has been associated with virulence  <cit> . this fungus exhibits mycelium morphology in its saprophytic phase at 25°c and yeast morphology in host tissues at 35-37°c. studies on the role of calcium in s. schenckii dimorphism showed that calcium stimulates the yeast to mycelium transition and that calcium uptake accompanies this transition  <cit> .

calcium is one of the most important intracellular second messengers and is involved in a wide range of cellular events in many eukaryotic cells  <cit> . calcium can affect cellular processes by binding to calmodulin  that in turn activates ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases   <cit> . these serine/threonine protein kinases have two major domains: a highly conserved amino-terminal catalytic domain and a carboxy-terminal regulatory domain. the regulatory domain consists of the autoinhibitory and ca2+/cam binding domains. the autoinhibitory domain acts as a pseudosubstrate, blocking access to the catalytic site  <cit> . ca2+/calmodulin binding to the regulatory domain causes a conformational change in ca2+/cam kinases exposing the catalytic domain by removing the autoinhibitory domain. this enables the binding of the substrate and its subsequent phosphorylation  <cit> .

the ca2+/calmodulin kinases constitute a family of related kinases that includes camkk, myosin light chain kinase and camki to camkiv. the role of camks in mammalian systems, particularly in neurons is well established  <cit> , while their presence and role in fungi is not fully documented. camks have been described for saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , aspergillus nidulans  <cit> , schizosaccharomyces pombe  <cit>  and neurospora crassa  <cit> , among others. whole genome sequencing projects also show the presence of hypothetical proteins homologous to camk in many other fungi. in s. cerevisiae, the camks function in the survival of pheromone-induced growth arrest, salt tolerance and thermotolerance  <cit> . in the filamentous fungus a. nidulans, the disruption of the camk encoding genes, cmka and cmkb was reported to be lethal  <cit> . in this fungus, camk is required for progression through the nuclear division cycle  <cit> .

in s. schenckii, we described a camk encoded by the sscmk <dig> gene   <cit> . the sscmk <dig> cdna encoded a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. the analysis of the derived amino acid sequence revealed a calcium/calmodulin kinase containing the  <dig> conserved sub-domains necessary for a functional serine/threonine protein kinase  <cit>  and a serine/threonine protein kinase catalytic domain. experiments using three different inhibitors of the camk pathway, w- <dig>  kn- <dig> and lavendustin c  <cit> , showed that they inhibited the re-entry of yeast cells into the budding cycle  <cit> . this observation was the first evidence of the involvement of a calcium/calmodulin pathway in the regulation of dimorphism in s. schenckii  <cit> .

traditionally, gene function analysis have been performed by examining the phenotypic or biochemical changes observed in organisms harbouring a mutation in the gene of interest or by gene knockout studies  <cit> . in this respect s. schenckii has been considered a genetically intractable organism. in the case of s. schenckii no successful transformation protocol has been implemented. in many other fungi, the transformation process has proven laborious, time-consuming and has potential disadvantages such as non-homologous recombination. alternatively, rna-mediated gene silencing has been used to manipulate gene expression in eukaryotic organisms and fungi  <cit> . in fungi, rna-mediated gene silencing has been demonstrated in many species  <cit> . to date, there are no reports of the use of rnai for the study of gene function in s. schenckii.

in this work we provide evidence of the presence of the rnai mechanism in s. schenckii by identifying a key enzyme of the rnai system, a dcl- <dig> homologue. we show that s. schenckii can be successfully transformed. we also knocked down the expression of the sscmk <dig> gene in s. schenckii using rnai. transformed cells exhibited an inhibition in the development of the yeast phase, which coincides with our previous report that sscmk <dig> is needed for the expression of the yeast morphology. yeast two-hybrid analysis of proteins interacting with sscmk <dig> showed the interaction of this enzyme with a hsp <dig> homologue, a very important player in fungal thermotolerance. inhibiting sshsp <dig> with geldanamycin  also inhibited the development of the yeast form of the fungus and the growth observed was similar to that obtained with the sscmk <dig> rnai transformants.

RESULTS
presence of a dicer- <dig> homologue in s. schenckii dna
a pcr homology approach was used to identify a dicer- <dig> homologue in s. schenckii dna. figure  <dig> shows the conserved domains detected in this protein fragment using the ncbi conserved domain database. sequence analysis shows  <dig> characteristic domains of the dcl proteins: a helicase c domain, a dsrna binding domain and an rnase  <dig> domain. this pcr product  shows a  <dig> bp fragment, encoding  <dig> amino acids, corresponding to a central, inner fragment of a dicer- <dig> protein homologue . this sequence includes a putative intron from nucleotide  <dig> to nucleotide  <dig> because genomic dna was used as template for pcr. an intron is also present in the n. crassa gene in this position. the panther classification system identified this protein as a member of a yet to be named family of proteins comprised of the n. crassa and the schizosaccharomyces pombe atp dependent helicase dcl- <dig> with an e value of  <dig>  e- <dig> 

additional file  <dig> shows the amino acid sequence alignment of the ssdcl- <dig> fragment to other fungal dcl- <dig> homologues. this alignment shows that these proteins are highly conserved among fungi, specifically in the regions of the above mentioned domains.

transformation of s. schenckii
a method for the transformation of s. schenckii was successfully implemented based on a modification of the method of royer et al.  <cit> , for other ophiostomaceae. this method was chosen after testing various transformation methods with s. schenckii yeast cells. two transformations were done, one using psd2g and psd2g-rnai <dig> and the other using psd2g and psd2g-rnai <dig> . for the first transformation, yeast cells were grown from conidia to a concentration of  <dig> cells/ml as described previously, in a modification of medium m. these logarithmically growing cells were converted to protoplasts as described in methods. the number of cells converted to protoplasts in the first transformation was 76%. the protoplasts were not separated from the undigested cells in order to avoid further damage to these cells. the cells were divided into  <dig> groups, each containing  <dig> μl of the suspension. the cells in the first group were treated with non-transforming dna. in the second group, cells were transformed with psd2g  and in the last group; the cells were transformed with psd2g-rnai <dig> . two hundred and twelve colonies were obtained from the cells transformed with psd2g and  <dig> colonies were obtained from cells transformed with psd2g-rnai <dig>  transformants were transferred to fresh geneticin-containing medium and grown for 5- <dig> days in medium m plates at 35°c. ninety five percent of the colonies transformed with psd2g and 97% of those transformed with psd2g-rnai <dig> survived transfer under these same conditions.

for the second transformation the same protocol was used. seventy nine percent of the cells transformed with psd2g-rnai <dig>  survived transfer to fresh geneticin-containing medium. conidia from transformants surviving this passage were used to inoculate  <dig> ml of medium m with geneticin  at 35°c with aeration.

further passages decreased the number of the rnai transformants capable of growing at 35°c. these cultures, where no growth was detected at 35°c, were transferred to 25°c and all of them thrived, showing mycelium morphology in spite of their inability to grow at 35°c.

additional file 3c also shows the results of colony pcr used to detect the presence of the transforming dna in s. schenckii yeast cells transformed with psd2g-rnai <dig>  cell suspensions of s. schenckii transformants were used as templates for pcr using the g <dig>  and g <dig>  primer pair. lane  <dig> shows the  <dig> bp dna ladder. lanes 1- <dig> and  <dig> shows the bands obtained when the cells transformed with psd2g-rnai <dig> from colonies  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were used as template, respectively. in lanes  <dig> and  <dig>  suspensions of non-transformed cells were used as templates for pcr. a band of the expected size,  <dig> bp, detecting the presence of the geneticin resistance cassette was observed in transformed yeast cells.

morphology of transformed cells
conidia from cells transformed with psd2g or psd2g-rnai <dig> were inoculated in liquid medium with geneticin  and incubated at 35°c, distinct differences were observed between the growth of cells transformed with psd2g and those transformed with psd2g-rnai <dig>  the cells transformed with psd2g grew as abundantly as the wild type cells with the appearance of yeast cell growth, while the cells transformed with psd2g-rnai <dig> showed little growth, resembling mycelia, a morphology not observed at 35°c . tube  <dig> shows the growth observed in wild type cells, tube  <dig> shows the growth observed in cells transformed with the empty plasmid psd2g and tubes  <dig> to  <dig> show the growth obtained from colonies  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, transformed with psd2g-rnai <dig> 

a second transformation using psd2g-rnai <dig> corroborated the phenotypic changes observed with the 3' fragment insert  and served as evidence that the observed morphological changes when using psd2g-rnai <dig> for transformation were not due to off-target effects. the same morphology was obtained when the fragment cloned into psd2g was from the 5' end of the sscmk <dig> gene  as shown in figure 2b. tubes  <dig> and  <dig> show the growth observed with the wild type cells and cells transformed with the empty plasmid, respectively. tubes  <dig> to  <dig> show the growth obtained from colonies  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, transformed with psd2g-rnai <dig> 

transformants, even those that could not grow at 35°c, developed into mycelia and grew almost as abundantly as the wild type at 25°c. figure  <dig> shows samples of the mycelial growth obtained in agar plates of a modification of medium m with geneticin at 25°c. figure 2c corresponds to the growth observed in cells transformed with psd2g and figure 2d and 2e correspond to the growth observed from colonies  <dig> and  <dig> transformed with psd2g-rnai <dig>  respectively.

microscopic morphology of transformed cells
the microscopic observation of the cultures mentioned above in figure 2a revealed that wild type cells and cells transformed with psd2g grew as yeasts at 35°c as shown in figure 2f and 2g, respectively. the cells transformed with psd2g-rnai <dig> showed clumps of mycelia and very few yeast cells when compared to the controls  at this same temperature.

quantitative real-time rt-pcr
yeast two-hybrid assay
more than  <dig> inserts from colonies growing in quadruple dropout medium   from two different s. schenckii yeast cdna libraries were analyzed for the presence of sscmk <dig> interacting proteins. only inserts from colonies that grew in qdo were cloned and sequenced. two different inserts were identified as belonging to a homologue of hsp <dig>  the sequence obtained by pcr from one of these inserts showed a  <dig> bp product and a derived amino acid sequence of  <dig> amino acids of the c-terminal domain of this protein. the other insert contained  <dig> bp and encoded the last  <dig> amino acids of the protein.

the complete coding cdna sequence of sshsp <dig> is shown in additional file  <dig>  in this figure, amino acid residues involved in the interaction with tetratricopeptide repeat proteins are shown in red letters and the hatpase domain is shaded in yellow.

additional file  <dig> shows the multiple sequence alignment of various fungal hsp <dig> and the human hsp <dig> isoform  <dig>  this figure shows the high degree of conservation of hsp <dig> fungal homologues, including sshsp <dig>  the hatpase or n terminal domain region is boxed in blue while the hsp <dig> domain region is boxed in red. a blue line marks the c terminal domain.

discussion
implementing a suitable transformation system that would be effective for s. schenckii was one of our main goals. gene knockout studies in s. schenckii have been hindered by two main reasons: first, the fungus is possibly diploid and second, no suitable transformation system has proven useful for this fungus. the information suggesting that s. schenckii is diploid comes from early studies done by us comparing the dna content of our strain  with that of a diploid candida albicans and haploid s. cerevisiae. in these experiments the dna content of our strain was similar to that of the diploid c. albicans and to twice that of the haploid s. cerevisiae . if our s. schenckii strain is diploid, one would have to effectively knockout both copies of a given gene using  <dig> markers to select the transformants.

a variety of transformation systems have been developed for many fungi, being the most popular that of ito and collaborators for s. cerevisiae  <cit> . preliminary work done by us using this method showed that this transformation protocol was not useful for s. schenckii yeast cells . in this paper we describe the adaptation of a method originally designed for the transformation of ophiostoma ulmi by royer et al., for the transformation of s. schenckii  <cit> . this method uses permeabilized cells and treatment with β-mercaptoethanol, both of these conditions have been observed by us to increase the success of transformation of s. schenckii, as is the case of ophiostoma ulmi  <cit> .

the frequency of transformation for all fungi is dependent on a variety of different parameters such as the nature of the transforming dna, the concentration of the transforming dna and the selection agent, among others  <cit> . our primary goal in this work was to obtain the greatest number of transformants; therefore a concentration of transforming dna of the order of  <dig> μg per  <dig> cells was used. having used this amount of dna, a frequency of transformation of approximately  <dig> transformants/μg of dna was obtained. this number of transformants is within the range reported with other fungi specifically when unlinearized dna is used  <cit> .

after having a reliable transformation system for s. schenckii, the next goal was to inquire if rnai was an option to study gene function in this fungus. due to the uncertainty as to the presence of the gene silencing mechanism in some fungi such as s. cerevisiae and ustilago maydis  <cit> , we identified the presence of one of the enzymes involved in processing rnai in s. schenckii dna, a dicer- <dig> homologue. as stated previously, the dicer enzymes are important components of the mechanism that processes double stranded rna precursors into small rnas  <cit> . in the filamentous fungi, one or two dicer-like homologues have been described  <cit> . n. crassa is the fungus where quelling was first described and has been more thoroughly studied  <cit> . in this fungus two dicer-like homologues, dcl- <dig> and dcl- <dig> genes have been described  <cit> . the double mutant dcl- <dig> and dcl- <dig> showed the suppression of the processing of dsrna into sirna in n. crassa.

having validated the presence of the rnai processing mechanism and having a suitable transformation system for s. schenckii, the sscmk <dig> gene was targeted using rnai directed to knockdown the expression of this gene. s. schenckii yeast cells were first transformed with psd2g-rnai <dig> containing a segment of the 3' end of the sscmk <dig> gene. the size of the sscmk <dig> insert used for transformation was in the range used for other fungal rnai transformations  <cit> . real-time pcr  confirmed that the levels of sscmk <dig> transcript were lower for the cells transformed with the psd2g-rnai <dig> than for the cells transformed with the empty plasmid at 35°c.

the psd2g-rnai <dig> transformants grew from the beginning as mycelium type colonies in the selection plates at 35°c. later when cultivated in liquid medium with aeration at 35°c, the growth observed, if any, was scarce and had the appearance of mycelium clumps with very few yeast cells. upon further transfers to fresh medium, some of the conidia lost the capacity to grow at 35°c but could grow as mycelia when these same cultures were transferred to 25°c, as stated previously. the inability to grow at 35°c could be due to a gradual lowering of the intracellular sscmk <dig> levels and the resulting impairment of thermotolerance in these cells, not viability. the fact that the conidia from some psd2g-rnai <dig> transformants could not grow at 35°c but if transferred to 25°c developed into mycelia and grew almost as abundantly as the wild type reinforces our previous results that suggest that sscmk <dig> is necessary for the development of the yeast form of the fungus.

in order to dismiss the possibility that the morphological effects could be due to an off-target effect, a second transformation was done using a different insert, this time from the 5' end of the sscmk <dig> gene. the same abnormal morphology and growth at 35°c was observed when psd2g-rnai <dig> was used for transformation.

the growth phase affected by silencing the sscmk <dig> gene was that of the yeast form of the fungus. in s. schenckii, the development of the yeast form of this fungus is favoured by increasing the temperature to 35°c. the capacity to tolerate temperatures between 35-37°c is essential for s. schenckii to grow in the human host. some other species of the ophiostomaceae that are plant pathogens, can produce yeast cells but most lack the ability to grow at 35-37°c and are non-pathogenic to humans  <cit> .

previous results using camk inhibitors pointed to the role of sscmk <dig> for the proliferation of the yeast cells induced to re-enter the cell cycle and for the maintenance of the yeast morphology in s. schenckii. in this work, we observed these same results but we also observed that the actual effect could lie in the loss of thermotolerance by the fungus when sscmk <dig> was silenced.

cam kinases in many systems, including fungi, have been reported to have an effect in the control of the cell cycle, differentiation and/or gene expression, specifically through the activation of transcription factors  <cit> . at the time of our first report, we hypothesized that sscmki was needed for the phosphorylation of proteins involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and/or for the phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors needed for the dimorphic transitions of the fungus. however, we mentioned that the final interpretation of our results awaited the identification of the interacting partners of sscmki that was also accomplished in this work.

important information related to the role of sscmk <dig> in s. schenckii, was obtained with the yeast two-hybrid assay. among the many proteins identified as interacting with sscmk <dig> we identified a s. schenckii homologue of hsp <dig>  this interaction was corroborated with co-ip. it is a well-known fact that all organisms from bacteria to higher eukaryotes respond to elevated temperatures by producing heat shock proteins. two important observations regarding a connection between the heat shock response and camks have been reported. in c. albicans, this kinase was shown to have a role in the capacity of fungal cells to grow at elevated temperature  <cit>  and in arabidopsis thaliana, camk- <dig> has been observed to be part of the heat shock response, possibly by the phosphorylation of the heat shock response factor and the induction of the transcription of the heat shock proteins  <cit> . in tomato , lecpk <dig>  a camk, is up regulated in response to heat stress  <cit> .

heat shock proteins are a widespread family of molecular chaperones found in bacteria and all eukaryotic organisms. these chaperones ensure both the folding of newly synthesized proteins and their refolding under denaturing stress conditions  <cit> . hsp <dig> has been reported to interact with protein kinases. specifically during the cell cycle, hsp <dig> has been reported to intervene, together with cdc <dig>  in the stabilization of the monomeric cdk <dig>  prior to its interaction with cyclin d  <cit> . it has also been reported to interact with the protein phosphatase, calcineurin that dephosphorylates camks  <cit> .

the interaction of hsp <dig> with protein kinases occurs at the n terminal domain of the hsp and two hypotheses has been postulated regarding the role of this hsp in the activity of protein kinases. hsp <dig> could facilitate the activation of the protein kinases by the induction of a conformational change in these kinases or could maintain the phosphorylated kinases sequestered until needed  <cit> . nevertheless, sscmk <dig> binds to the c terminal domain of sshsp  <dig> where effectors of this heat shock protein interact. this domain starts with amino acid d <dig> in the human homologue of hsp <dig>  this suggests that instead of hsp <dig> regulating sscmk <dig>  the kinase could in some form or another be regulating hsp <dig>  if this were correct, lowering the levels of sscmk <dig> would affect the function of hsp <dig> and in turn render the cells intolerant to high temperatures as was observed by us.

based on this observation, we assumed that inhibitors of hsp <dig> should have similar effects on the growth of s. schenckii as was observed for psd2g-rnai <dig> and psd2g-rnai <dig> transformants. one of the most important inhibitor of hsp <dig> is geldanamycin. this compound was used to inhibit hsp <dig> in c. albicans where it induced yeast cells to undergo a switch to filamentous growth  <cit> . in s. schenckii, at a concentration of  <dig> μm, this compound induced the development of conidia into an abnormal mycelial morphology very similar to that observed in the psd2g-rnai transformants, at conditions suitable for the development of the yeast morphology. this is in accordance with the observation that sscmk <dig> might be needed for the correct functioning of hsp <dig> and thermotolerance in the s. schenckii. further testing using the yeast two-hybrid assay will help us identify if calcineurin is also interacting with hsp <dig> in s. schenckii, as has been reported in other fungi such as c. neoformans and c. albicans  <cit> . if this is so, we could postulate that camk <dig> regulates hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig> in turn regulates camk <dig> by its effects on calcineurin and that these interactions are needed for thermotolerance in this fungus. a possible model for the interaction of hsp <dig> and sscmk <dig> is included in figure  <dig>  in this figure we propose that sscmk <dig> binds to hsp <dig> at its c terminal and this activates hsp <dig> and the release of effector proteins that bind to its n terminal domain, one of which can be calcineurin that can dephosphorylate the sscmk <dig> and inhibit its activity. it can also release other kinases that are also effectors of fungal dimorphism. in this figure the interactions regarding calcineurin are speculative although the interaction has been reported in c. neoformans, this protein has not been identified in s. schenckii  <cit> 

CONCLUSIONS
the present study provides new evidence regarding the role of sscmk <dig> in the development of the yeast form of s. schenckii. the knockdown of the sscmk <dig> gene expression using rnai inhibited the growth of the yeast form of the fungus at 35°c but had no effect on mycelial growth observed at 25°c. these results suggest that the viability of the fungus was not affected in the rnai transformants and that the observed effects were due to the loss of thermotolerance. a yeast two-hybrid assay using sscmk <dig> as bait revealed that this kinase interacts with sshsp <dig> at the c terminal portion of hsp <dig>  inhibiting hsp <dig> brought about thermal intolerance in s. schenckii yeast cells and the development of a morphology at 35°c reminiscent of that observed in the sscmk <dig> rnai transformants. this suggests that the role of sscmk <dig> in thermotolerance could be through its effects on sshsp <dig>  these results confirmed sscmk <dig> as an important enzyme involved in the dimorphism of s. schenckii. this study constitutes the first report of the transformation of s. schenckii and the use of rnai to study gene function in this fungus.
