BACKGROUND
salinity and drought stresses are the two most important environmental factors limiting plant growth and development in semiarid and arid areas  <cit> . over  <dig> countries in the world have been identified as being affected by salinity  <cit> , and the scale of the problem seems to be increasing at an alarming rate  <cit> . salinity, together with drought, has far-reaching implications for food security, economic sustainability and the irreplaceable biodiversity of any affected area, and it is anticipated that these challenges will be exacerbated by the projected impact of climate change. the effects of water-insufficiency stresses have been studied extensively; they limit water and micronutrient uptake and lead to closure of stomata, decline in carbon metabolism, stunted growth, ion/salt toxicity and reduced yield  <cit> .

for plants to survive under such conditions, they must sense and respond to these abiotic stresses rapidly and in a complex manner  <cit> , through signalling and regulatory pathways  <cit>  mediated by abscisic acid  <cit>  or ethylene  <cit> , generally resulting in altered expression of transcription factors  <cit> , and in many cases in increased expression of genes encoding products required for osmoregulation, cell protection and/or acclimation . these modifications may lead to changes in signal transduction, ionic homeostasis, scavenging of reactive oxygen species, accumulation of compatible solutes and growth regulation . a common strategy for the identification of overall changes in gene expression under salt stress is to compare the transcriptomes of the targeted species or cultivars using microarrays and/or rna-seq technologies  <cit> . a plethora of comparisons between salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant cultivars of model and non-model plant species, including arabidopsis, rice  <cit> , poplar , tomato  <cit> , potato  <cit> , medicago truncatula <cit> , sugarcane  <cit>  and olive  <cit> , have been reported to date. these studies have identified more than  <dig> families of transcription factors and numerous enzyme-encoding genes involved in responses to salt stress  <cit> . however, overall changes in gene expression and physiological responses to salt stress vary greatly between different species, particularly between sensitive and non-sensitive pairs of related species . it is often difficult to ascertain whether these differences were caused by divergence during the course of evolution or were brought about through adaptive differentiation. it is therefore of interest to compare the overall changes in gene expression that occur in sister species under salt stress, as this will minimise phylogenetic effects.

here we examine differences in the transcriptomes of two sister desert poplar species under salt stress. populus serves as a model for elucidating physiological and molecular mechanisms of stress tolerance in tree species . both p. euphratica and p. pruinosa grow in dry deserts with high summer temperatures . both species can tolerate high salinity and survive nacl concentrations of more than 300 mm  <cit>  in nutrient solution, and p. euphratica has been used as a model species for studying abiotic responses to salt or drought stress . in addition to differences in leaf and hair morphology between the two species, they also occur in different types of habitat. p. euphratica is found in dry deserts with deep underground water while p. pruinosa is distributed in deserts where the underground water is closer to the surface, and therefore more accessible, but also saltier near ancient or extant rivers. it is likely that these two species have diverged due to ecological differentiation, in spite of ongoing gene flow  <cit> .

in order to test whether regulatory and metabolic pathways in these two species have diverged during their adaptive interactions with salt and other stresses, the transcriptomes of callus subjected to 24 h of salt stress, and control callus samples, from p. euphratica and p. pruinosa were compared in order to identify differentially expressed genes  and alternative splicing  events that occurred in response to salt stress. our results revealed that these two poplar species have both common and species-specific patterns of gene expression under salt stress. the dynamic transcriptome expression profiles of these sister species under salt stress obtained in this study may provide useful insights to inform further analyses of the mechanism of high salinity tolerance in plants. in addition, the genes found to be differentially expressed under salt stress in both species may facilitate the identification of key genes as potentially suitable targets for biotechnological manipulation with the aim of improving poplar salt tolerance.

RESULTS
analysis and mapping of illumina-solexa sequencing tags
we used the illumina-solexa sequencing platform to sequence the p. euphratica <cit>  and p. pruinosa <cit>  transcriptomes obtained from the four treatments, including two unstressed callus samples as controls  and two salt-stressed callus samples as treatments . after removing low-quality sequences and trimming adapter sequences, ~ <dig> million 75-bp paired-end clean reads were generated from each of the cdna libraries in the illumina genome analyzer runs . these tags from the four digital gene expression  libraries were mapped to the available p. trichocarpa transcript sequences. approximately 80% of the tags had matches. most  of the tags with matches were unique tags , while the remainder  were non-unique  or unaligned. for more detailed investigation of gene expression in the different treatments, only unique tags were used in the analysis. in total,  <dig>  transcripts were identified from the four conditions. the transcripts identified accounted for  <dig> % of the  <dig>  annotated genes in poplar. in both control and salt stress treatments, the numbers of mapped genes in p. euphratica  were found to be similar to those in p. pruinosa  . we further compared the mapped genes among the four treatments , and found that ~ <dig> % of them were present in at least two treatments .table  <dig>

degs in the two species under salt stress
to identify global transcriptional changes occurring under salt stress, we applied four independent metrics to identify genes that were differentially expressed between the 24-h salt-stressed callus and control callus samples in p. euphratica and p. pruinosa. for each metric, we selected those degs whose expression profiles met three criteria:  the fpkm value was ≥ <dig> in either of the libraries,  log <dig>  was >  <dig> or < - <dig>  and  the adjusted p-value  was <  <dig> . in this study, degs with higher expression levels in salt-stressed callus when compared with control callus samples were termed ‘up-regulated’, while those with lower expression levels in salt-stressed callus were termed ‘down-regulated’. there were  <dig> and  <dig> genes identified by all metrics as being up-regulated in p. euphratica and p. pruinosa, respectively, and  <dig> and  <dig> genes identified by all metrics as down-regulated in p. euphratica and p. pruinosa, respectively . there were more up-regulated degs in p. pruinosa than in p. euphratica, while there were more down-regulated degs in p. euphratica than in p. pruinosa.figure  <dig> 
comparison of four metrics for classifying degs. venn diagrams of the numbers of up-regulated  and down-regulated  genes identified by four comparisons of control callus and salt-stressed callus from p. euphratica  and p. pruinosa .



the degs identified were classified into eight clusters according to their expression patterns . of these eight clusters, four were up-regulated or down-regulated exclusively in a single species, as follows: up-regulated exclusively in p. euphratica  or in p. pruinosa ; down-regulated exclusively in p. euphratica  or in p. pruinosa . the remaining four clusters consisted of genes that were up- or down-regulated in the two species; two of these clusters showed similar co-regulation patterns whereas the other two showed opposing regulation patterns. in the two clusters with similar co-regulation patterns,  <dig> degs were co-up-regulated and  <dig> degs were co-down-regulated in the two species. within the co-up-regulated clusters, only one transcript  was undetectable in the calli of the two species under unstressed conditions , suggesting that this gene is expressed specifically under salt stress in both species. in the two clusters with opposing patterns of regulation, only  <dig> deg was up-regulated in p. euphratica but down-regulated in p. pruinosa, and only  <dig> deg was down-regulated in p. euphratica but up-regulated in p. pruinosa. this result suggested that our integrated deg identification was sensitive and reliable.figure  <dig>

confirmation of differentially expressed candidate genes by qrt-pcr analysis
to confirm the gene expression inferred from rna-seq, a total of  <dig> candidate degs with salt-related process were selected for the qrt-pcr analyses, comprising  <dig> degs exclusively regulated in a single species,  <dig> co-up-regulated and  <dig> co-down-regulated in the two species . although the exact change did not exactly match each other, the expression trends of all  <dig> genes from qrt-pcr and illumina-solexa rna sequencing analyses were largely consistent , demonstrating the reliability of the rna-seq results .figure  <dig>

gene functional categories of two species under salt stress
firstly, an overview of the main results was obtained by wego and the degs were assigned to go terms in the three component ontologies . then, groups of genes with functions involved in salt responses were identified using parametric analysis of gene set enrichment  . go enrichment in p. euphratica was significantly different from that in p. pruinosa. in the cellular component ontology, ‘apoplast’  appeared to respond to salt stress in both species; while ‘cell part’  and ‘cell’  were enriched only in p. euphratica; whereas ‘extracellular region’ , ‘external encapsulating structure’  and ‘cell wall’  were enriched only in p. pruinosa. in the molecular function ontology, ‘cofactor binding’ , ‘coenzyme binding’ , ‘peptidase inhibitor activity’  and ‘endopeptidase inhibitor activity’  were enriched in both species, while another nine terms from the molecular function ontology were enriched exclusively in p. euphratica. six terms from the biological processes ontology were enriched exclusively in p. euphratica and three terms were enriched in both species. the go terms enriched in p. euphratica were related to responses to stress and metabolic processes, and the most highly enriched term was ‘response to stress’ . we also used singular enrichment analysis  to identify functional groups of genes differentially expressed in the two species under salinity . go enrichment for genes up-regulated or down-regulated exclusively in p. euphratica was significantly different from that in p. pruinosa. the detected differences suggested that these two desert poplars might have developed different genetic pathways for adaptation to differentiated salty desert habitats.figure  <dig>

differences in expression of hormone-related genes in the two species under salt stress
using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database as our source of annotations,  <dig> out of  <dig> populus genes annotated as being involved in hormone biosynthesis  <cit>  were detected in the four libraries and  <dig> of these genes were differentially expressed in either p. euphratica or p. pruinosa under salt stress . among these hormone biosynthesis-related degs,  <dig> were identified in p. euphratica, of which  <dig> were up-regulated and one was down-regulated during salt stress, while  <dig> were identified in p. pruinosa, including  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated degs; only  <dig> were co-regulated in the two species. hierarchical clustering of the  <dig> hormone-related degs showed overall differences between p. euphratica and p. pruinosa in response to salt stress . under salt stress, most hormone-related degs were co-up-regulated or co-down-regulated in both species. interestingly, three aba metabolism-related genes , poptr_0011s <dig>  and poptr_0001s <dig> ) were up-regulated exclusively in p. pruinosa.figure  <dig>

differences in expression of transporter-encoding genes in the two species under salt stress
on the basis of annotations in the database of arabidopsis thaliana transporter proteins , a total of  <dig> genes differentially regulated according to all metrics in either p. euphratica or p. pruinosa during salt stress were categorized as transporters . among these,  <dig> degs were identified in p. euphratica, of which  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated during salt stress, while  <dig> were differentially regulated in p. pruinosa, consisting of  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated degs, and  <dig> were co-regulated in the two species. for example, we found that poptr_0003s <dig> , poptr_0008s <dig>  and poptr_0006s <dig> , which are homologous to arabidopsis thaliana na+/h+ antiporter  <dig> , potassium transporter  <dig>  and abc transporter , respectively, were co-up-regulated in both species. however, poptr_0005s <dig>  and poptr_0014s <dig> , which are homologous to arabidopsis thaliana sodium/hydrogen exchanger  <dig>  and potassium transporter  <dig>  genes, were up-regulated only in p. euphratica. in contrast, poptr_0004s <dig>  and poptr_0013s <dig> , which are homologous to arabidopsis thaliana chloride channel protein clc-c  and potassium transporter  <dig>  genes respectively, were up-regulated exclusively in p. pruinosa. these results corroborate previous findings , and confirm that genes encoding proteins such as sodium and potassium ion transmembrane transporters, and chloride channel and abc transporters, which are important for maintaining and re-establishing homeostasis in the cytoplasm, are induced to high levels in response to salinity stress  <cit> .

differences in expression of transcription factor genes in the two species under salt stress
we identified  <dig> transcription factors in populus trichocarpa and classified them into  <dig> families  based on published annotations. a total of  <dig> genes that were differentially regulated in either p. euphratica or p. pruinosa during salt stress were categorized as transcription factors . of these,  <dig> degs were identified in p. euphratica, including  <dig> that were up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated during salt stress, while  <dig> degs were identified in p. pruinosa, of which  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated. only  <dig> degs were co-regulated in both species . several of the transcription factors, such as ap2/erf and bzip, which are known to be induced by stress in model plant species   <cit> , were highly expressed in response to salinity stress in p. euphratica or p. pruinosa.table  <dig>

the co-up-regulated degs in the two species under salt stress and allele mining
a total of  <dig> co-up-regulated degs in the two species were identified in salt stress  and the important ones were selected and listed in table  <dig>  the candidate genes identified in the present study contained both the previously reported salt-responsive genes and some species-specific ones. of them, most genes were involved in and highly enriched in functional categories such as response to stress, signal transduction, transmembrane transport, transcriptional regulation and basic metabolic processes . these findings are beneficial to allele mining of two poplar species related to their common or differentiated response to stressed habitats in the future. allele mining based on the candidate genes were found to be important in dissecting naturally selected allelic variations that controlled differentiated traits  <cit> . in addition, promoters are found to play a key role in gene regulation, and any change in these regions will change gene expression and the controlled traits. therefore, the identified variations through such an approach may be mainly located in the promoter regions  <cit> . overall, the co-up-regulated degs identified in the present study provide critical genetic bases for further allele mining, functional analyses and transgenic practices for developing the salt-tolerant poplars and crops.table  <dig>

a comparison of degs identified by our results and other transcriptome studies of the salt-stressed poplars
in order to test the consistency of degs across different treatments and approaches, we compared degs between our results and other available transcriptome studies of the salt stressed poplars. ottow et al.  <cit>  examined changes in transcript levels of various genes known to be involved in salt or general stress signaling or adaptation in p. euphratica leaves by dot-blot expression. they identified nine genes with significant changes in response to salt stress. some of them were be confirmed in the present study, for example, galactinol synthase  <dig> , calcineurin b-like protein  <dig> , alternative oxidase 1a  and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase  . galactinol synthase  catalyzes the first step in the biosynthetic pathway of raffinose oligosaccharides using galactose and myo-inositol as substrates and this gene was also up-regulated in plants under cold, heat, drought, and salt stress  <cit> . significant increases in galactinol synthase and alternative oxidase after salt stress point to shifts in carbohydrate metabolism and suppression of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria under salt stress  <cit> . in addition, gu et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> genes with altered transcript accumulation in the salt-stressed p. euphratica by microarray hybridization. the genes of them, responsible for hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein, carbonic anhydrase  <dig>  cytochrome p <dig>  aquaporin, sucrose synthase and aspartate aminotransferase were confirmed in these present study. these genes were also revealed to be salt-responsive in other studies  <cit> .

the drought responses of plants are similar to those in response to salinity because both stresses lead to physiological water deficit  <cit> . bogeat-triboulot et al.  <cit>  provided a comprehensive analysis of p. euphratica subjected to gradual soil water depletion, and observed  <dig> regulatory and protective genes involved in long-term response to drought. similar results were also found by cohen et al.  <cit>  and tang et al.  <cit> . among them, those genes involved in metabolites of proline, raffinose, galactose, inositol and sucrose under drought stress were found to have changed their expressions in response to salt stress in the presnet study. an increase in galactinol, raffinose and stachyose content may have improved osmoprotection and ros scavenging when poplars were stressed by drought or salt. however, in the present study, we identified numerous more transcripts with significant up-regulations in both poplars when stressed, including udp-glycosyltransferase-like protein, fad-binding and bbe domain-containing protein, putative nucleoredoxin  <dig>  and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. all these newly identified genes should have also played an important role during salt adaptation of two species. their functions and molecular mechanisms need further clarifications in the future.

alternative splicing of transcripts in the two species under salt stress
finally, to investigate the role of alternative splicing  in response to salt stress, we conducted a survey of transcript isoforms across the four libraries and examined six common types of ‘alternative splicing events’. for each of these event types, reads deriving from specific regions can be used to identify the expression of one alternative isoform or the other . we identified  <dig>  as events which were mapped to the  <dig> poplar genomic loci from the four libraries, suggesting that ~20% of  <dig>  loci in poplar are potentially subject to as. this observed as percentage is comparable to the percentage of the genes shown to undergo as in a. thaliana  and rice   <cit> . in both control and salt stress treatments, the number of genes exhibiting as events in p. euphratica  is similar to that in p. pruinosa , respectively. in addition to the as loci  common to both species, around  <dig> and  <dig> of the loci show as events only in either p. euphratica or p. pruinosa in response to salt stress . we further classified those genes that underwent as events on the basis of functional ontology. go enrichment for the genes displaying as events exclusively in p. euphratica was significantly different from that for genes undergoing as in p. pruinosa .table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
our transcriptional profiling analysis revealed numerous genes that were differentially expressed in both p. euphratica and p. pruinosa under salt stress. the differential expressions of the selected genes inferred from rna-seq were confirmed by qrt-pcr data. gene ontology analyses of these degs suggested that go enrichment in p. euphratica was significantly different from that in p. pruinosa. we found that numerous genes involved in hormone biosynthesis, or encoding transporters or transcription factors, showed different expression patterns between these two species under salt stress. these differences suggest that these two desert poplars may have developed species-specific pathways for adaptation to salinity during the course of ecological speciation in their different salty desert habitats. the results of our comparative analyses imply that different species, even sister species, may employ different genetic pathways to cope with salt stress. this suggests that it may be more difficult than previously anticipated to design salt-tolerant plant cultivars  <cit> . in order to develop cultivars with high salt tolerance, particular attention should be paid to those genes that are differentially expressed in two or more different species under salt stress. such genes can be used to facilitate genetic improvement of crops, including cultivated poplars, for growth on saline soils.
