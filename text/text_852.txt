BACKGROUND
the nematode caenorhabditis elegans is a facultative hermaphrodite that reproduces either by virtue of self-fertilization or cross-breeding with a male . the hermaphrodites are somatically female but produce a limited number of sperm during their late larval development before switching to the production of eggs. the sperm is stored in the spermatheca and can be used to fertilize the newly formed eggs. except for a very few males  that arise spontaneously as the result of x chromosome non-disjunction, the entire self-progeny is hermaphroditic. males can mate with hermaphrodites and give rise to 50% males in the cross-progeny. cross-fertilization is not possible among hermaphrodites  <cit> . male derived sperm is also stored in the spermatheca where it competes with the hermaphrodite's own sperm for the fertilization of the oocytes. male sperm is usually larger and therefore has a competitive advantage over the hermaphrodite's sperm  <cit> .

if hermaphrodites can reproduce by self-fertilization, males are superfluous. in fact, they could even represent a burden, decreasing individual fitness, in analogy with the two-fold cost of males in theories on the evolution of sex  <cit> . therefore, the persistence of males represents an important puzzle for our understanding of c. elegans biology. its explanation is expected to advance a more general insight into the evolution of androdioecy. to date, the function of c. elegans males has been addressed using two main approaches:  experimental evolution in the laboratory, and  analysis of  outcrossing rates in wild populations.

the experimental evolution of laboratory populations of the standard strain n <dig>  uniformly demonstrated that initial male frequencies of either 50% or 33% rapidly and steeply decline to less than 10% within ten to  <dig> generations  <cit> . furthermore, compared with the dioecious species caenorhabditis remanei, mating behaviour was severely compromised in the n <dig> strain, i.e. males often fail to find hermaphrodite mates, possibly due to limited production and/or degeneracy of the hermaphrodite's sex pheromone . taken together, these results suggested that males represent evolutionary relics without any particular function, which are only still present, because of a relatively recent switch to hermaphroditism and selfing in the lineage leading to c. elegans  <cit> . interestingly, however, other natural isolates show clear differences to n <dig>  the spontaneous production of males is a pre-requisite for male maintenance and it reaches values of more than 3% of the total offspring in some isolates – clearly more than n <dig> with a value of less than  <dig> %  <cit> . similarly, males are able to persist in populations of some strains, e.g. the hawaiian strain cb <dig> and the oregon strain px <dig>  <cit> . this effect seems to be enhanced in these two strains  if worm populations are subjected to fluctuating environmental conditions like variable exposure to different mutagens  <cit> . similarly, populations with deficient dna repair and thus increased mutations rates also maintain males at higher frequencies  <cit> . these results suggested that males are beneficial to ensure frequent outcrossing, which is favored under variable environmental conditions and/or high deleterious mutation rates  <cit> .

an alternative albeit indirect route to assess the function of males is to infer outcrossing rates in natural populations. several recent studies analysed new c. elegans isolates from different parts of the world using a variety of molecular markers such as microsatellites, aflps, or dna sequence polymorphisms. they unanimously demonstrate that outcrossing does occur, but that it is usually extremely rare  <cit> . the only exception is an inferred outcrossing rate of  <dig>   <cit> , whereas all other studies suggest it to range in between 10- <dig> up to  <dig>   <cit> . consequently, males leave a genetic footprint in natural populations. in consistency with the conclusions from experimental evolution in the lab, rare outcrossing may be sufficient to eliminate mutational load and/or maintain genetic diversity required for rapid adaptation to fluctuating environments  <cit> .

in the first part of this publication we describe the decline of the proportion of males in eight different natural isolates under standard laboratory conditions. the fact that males are lost at very different rates even if the strains are maintained under the same conditions indicates that the difference is genetically determined and is therefore a putatively selectable trait. in the second part we evaluate the possible reasons for the difference in male persistence between the two common laboratory strains n <dig> and cb <dig>  several behavioral and physiological factors could account for this difference, for example: i) the mating efficiency of the males, ii) the mating efficiency of the hermaphrodites , iii) the competitive advantage of the male derived sperm, iv) the number of sperm transferred, v) the difference between the maximum number of progeny a hermaphrodite can produce with and without mating. in order to address these points, we performed a systematic analysis of intra- and inter-strain crosses between n <dig> and cb4856- to our knowledge for the very first time in this context. our results indicate that cb <dig> males are capable of mating successfully with more hermaphrodites than n <dig> males and that n <dig> hermaphrodites produced a higher number of  self-progeny even after mating. both these effects result in a higher proportion of males in the next generation for cb <dig> if compared with n <dig>  thus potentially explaining male persistence in the former but not the latter strain.

male maintenance assay
this assay served to determine the persistence of males over time in different natural c. elegans isolates and in different population sizes. for each strain, we set up several crosses using a male:hermaphrodite ratio of 2: <dig>  these crosses yielded populations with a gender ratio of approximately 1: <dig>  for each strain, the populations were mixed four days after setting up the crosses and a defined number of individuals  was randomly chosen and transferred onto ngm plates for the experiment . these experimental populations were all treated as follows: after three days adult males and hermaphrodites were counted . on the next day the population was reduced to the original population size and transferred to a new plate . three days later, adult males and hermaphrodites were counted again, followed by population size reduction and worm transfer one day later, as above. this whole procedure was repeated for a total of eight times . all male maintenance assays were done on  <dig> cm ngm plates, seeded with  <dig> ml of e. coli op <dig> culture. two sets of experiments were performed: i) two replica runs per strain and population size were done in parallel for strains n <dig>  cb <dig>  ab <dig>  ju <dig>  my <dig>  my <dig>  my <dig> and rc <dig> using population sizes of  <dig> and 150; and ii) five replica runs per strain and population size were done in parallel for n <dig> and cb <dig> using population sizes of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in this context, one important objective was to evaluate the effect of different population sizes on male persistance. the exact numbers used  were chosen arbitrarily.

counting
the plates were placed under a dissecting microscope and searched systematically always using the same search path with the help of a grid, which was positioned below the plates. the first  <dig> to  <dig> adults encountered were then used to determine the number of adult hermaphrodites and adult males. note that this is equivalent to a random choice of individuals. only hermaphrodites with developing embryos in the uterus were counted as adult hermaphrodites. this may have lead to a slight underestimation of the number of hermaphrodites.

transfer
worms were washed off plates with m <dig> buffer and counted without paying attention to the developmental stage or sex of the worms. the volume that was expected to contain the desired number of worms was transferred onto a new plate. thus, the populations always consisted of mixed generations, so that the effective reproductive population was smaller than the actual number of animals.

male mating efficiency assay
this assay served to evaluate the mating efficiency of males in terms of mated hermaphrodites, total offspring produced per male and also cross- as well as self-progeny produced per mated hermaphrodite. a single male was confronted with an excess of hermaphrodites, so that it could mate as often as possible. in a pilot experiment,  <dig> hermaphrodites were found to be sufficient to ensure that the male would never come close to mating with all of them. in fact, during the main experiment the highest number of mated hermaphrodites per plate was  <dig> 

mating plates were prepared four days prior to the experiment. one male and  <dig> young adult hermaphrodites were placed on mating plates. every  <dig> hours the male was moved to a new mating plate with  <dig> young adult hermaphrodites until no more successful mating was observed. hermaphrodites, which were exposed to males, were placed individually on ngm plates seeded with  <dig> μl e. coli op <dig>  the hermaphrodites were transferred to new plates every  <dig> h. after three days the progeny was counted or, if the number of plates was too high to be processed immediately, equal numbers of plates from both treatments were put at 4°c and counted within a few days. this step allowed us to do more replicas in parallel and have all plates scored by the same person, in order to avoid possible observer biases. we did not observe any lethality in response to the cooling step. a hermaphrodite was considered to be mated when more than one male was found among the progeny . the number of cross progeny per mated hermaphrodite was estimated as twice the number of male progeny. since it was not feasible to do all crosses in parallel, we used an incomplete block design, where two different crosses were set up in parallel and different pairs of parallel crosses were assayed in four experimental runs: i) n <dig> males crossed with n <dig> and with cb <dig> hermaphrodites; ii) cb <dig> males crossed with n <dig> and with cb <dig> hermaphrodites; iii) n <dig> and cb <dig> males crossed with n <dig> hermaphrodites; iv) n <dig> and cb <dig> males crossed with cb <dig> hermaphrodites.

mating behavior assays
these two assays were used to characterize in more detail the time required by males until first contact with a hermaphrodite and first spicule insertion  and also the number of contacts with hermaphrodites as well as spicule insertions over a nine hour period . in both assays, we used the same general conditions as in the male mating efficiency assay , in order to permit comparison of results.

one hour assay
l <dig> males and l <dig> hermaphrodites were transferred to separate plates one day prior to testing in order to obtain virgin adult animals. at the beginning of the experiment, one male was placed together with  <dig> hermaphrodites on a mating plate. we then measured the time until the male touched a hermaphrodite and showed mating behavior  and until the first time the spicule was inserted . observations were terminated after spicule insertion or, if these did not occur, after one hour.

nine-hours assay
 <dig> l <dig> hermaphrodites per plate were placed on mating plates one day prior to the experiment. at the same time l <dig> males were collected and placed on a plate without hermaphrodites. to start the experiment single males were transferred onto the mating plates with the  <dig> hermaphrodites. within  <dig> hours, the plates were inspected  <dig> times . at every inspection, the male was scored as either having no contact with a hermaphrodite, being in contact with a hermaphrodite, or having its spicule inserted.

self-brood-size assay
this assay served to determine the number of offspring produced trough self-fertilization in the absence of males for two natural isolates, n <dig> and cb <dig>  young adult hermaphrodites, which had no developing embryos in the uterus yet, were placed individually onto plates and moved to new plates at least once every day until they stopped laying eggs. three days after the removal of the mother the progeny on every plate was counted and summed up to total numbers.

hermaphrodite outcrossing efficiency assay
this assay was used to test how more frequent mating affects the hermaphrodite's production of self- as well as cross-progeny. mating plates were prepared four days prior to the assay. one l <dig> hermaphrodite was placed together with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> males onto a mating plate. the hermaphrodite was transferred onto a new mating plate with new young males every day until it stopped laying eggs. the old males were removed from the plates. after one day, additional food bacteria  were added to the plates and hermaphrodites and males were counted two days later, when they were young adults.

statistical analysis
all statistical analyses were done with the program jmp in version  <dig> . <dig>  or spss version  <dig>  . the male proportion over time in populations of the different isolates was evaluated using logistic regression based on a full factorial model with time and either population size or c. elegans strain as fixed predictors. the male proportion at specific time points was additionally examined with a wilcoxon sign rank test. variation in the number of mated hermaphrodites, the number of offspring per male, and the self- and cross-progeny per mated hermaphrodite was assessed with a general linear model, using an incomplete block design, including male strain, hermaphrodite strain and the interaction between them as fixed factors and experimental block as a random factor. in case of significant interaction terms, significant differences among groups were evaluated with tukey hsd posthoc tests. variation in offspring number per repeatedly mated hermaphrodite was tested with an anova, using a full factorial design with male strain and hermaphrodite strain as fixed factors. subsequent posthoc tests were performed with tukey hsd. a similar anova was performed to assess the effect of different numbers of males on offspring numbers of repeatedly mated hermaphrodites. in this case, number of males was used as a fixed predictor in the model. with respect to mating behaviour, the time measurements until first contact or first copula were always terminated after  <dig> min, resulting in non-continuous data. therefore, differences between crosses were assessed using the wilcoxon sign rank test. the variation in the number of copulas during this time frame were examined with the fisher exact test. differences in the number of contacts or copulations over  <dig> observation points within a  <dig> h interval were assessed with the wilcoxon sign rank test, since the data were non-parametric.

RESULTS
variation in male maintenance among c. elegans strains
we first tested in how far there is variation in male maintenance among populations of different natural c. elegans isolates. eight strains were tested at two different arbitrarily chosen population sizes . the proportion of males was significantly affected by the factor time, the strain studied, and also the interaction of the two. in particular, males disappeared completely from the cultures of some strains, among them n <dig>  in contrast, in other strains, among them cb <dig>  the cultures appeared to reach a stable frequency of males after about two weeks .

to refine the analysis we examined the persistence of males at four different arbitrarily chosen population sizes  for n <dig> and cb <dig> . the proportion of males was significantly reduced within few generations. in fact, males disappeared almost entirely from all n <dig> cultures. the loss was much slower in cb <dig> populations. here, male frequencies were significantly affected by population size, whereby larger populations  sustained a higher number of males . for these two population sizes, the final male frequency was significantly different between n <dig> and cb <dig>  while this was not the case for the smaller populations .

taken together, our results confirm long-standing anecdotal knowledge available within the c. elegans community: we, and many others, have noticed that it is necessary to deliberately set up crosses with an excess of males every few generations in order to maintain n <dig> populations with males for genetic analysis. for cb <dig> this is not necessary. our data are also in agreement with previous studies, in which males were rapidly lost in experimental populations of n <dig>  <cit>  but maintained at constant levels in those of cb <dig>  <cit> . since during our experiments the different strains were kept in parallel under identical conditions, the difference in male maintenance between them must have a genetic basis. thus, our results suggest that c. elegans bears considerable intra-specific genetic variation that affect male frequency, making it a potentially selectable trait. interestingly, population size differences had a significant effect on male persistence. this finding may be a consequence of the population size itself, e.g. smaller populations may loose males more often due to chance, thus accelerating male decline. a non-exclusive alternative explanation may be density differences among the population sizes. in this case, higher densities in the large population sizes may associate with more male-hermaphrodite contacts, which could result in higher mating rates, thus stabilizing male frequencies. at the moment, our results do not allow to distinguish between these two effects.

we decided to further characterize the proximate processes that account for variation in male persistence between two of the extremes, namely the strain n <dig> and cb <dig> 

proximate determinants of male persistence: male mating efficiency
the factors underlying variation in male maintenance were systematically assessed by reciprocal crosses. the analysis was based on all possible mating combinations between cb <dig> and n <dig>  using an incomplete block design . the main experiment focused on the consequences of repeated mating for individual males, which is likely to be realistic in most populations, where male frequency is usually less than  <dig>   <cit> . three parameters were simultaneously evaluated: i) the number of successful copulations per individual male, which was offered an excess of virgin hermaphrodites  every day over a period of six days, ii) the number of sired offspring per male with – accordingly – virtually unlimited access to mates, and iii) the number of cross- and self-progeny per successfully mated hermaphrodite . since early reproduction should have a stronger influence on population dynamics than late reproduction, we also performed a separate analysis of the data from only the first two days . the results lead to essentially identical conclusions like the results for the full reproductive period . therefore, in the following we focus our discussion on the data for the full reproductive life-span.

a, for each cross , the hermaphrodite strain is given first, the male strain last. the mean number of mated hermaphrodites per male, the mean number of offspring per male, the mean number of cross-progeny per male and mated hermaphrodite as well as the mean number of self-progeny per male and mated hermaphrodite are shown. se, standard error. statistical results  are shown for the whole model. if the latter shows at least a trend , then the statistical importance of different factors in the model are given. the model also included the random factor "experimental date", which however never produced a significant effect . significant probabilities are given in bold.

cb <dig> males had significantly more successful copulations  and significantly more offspring than n <dig> males . these two traits were not significantly affected by the hermaphrodite strain used. therefore, the difference in progeny production by males is most likely a consequence of the differences in mating rates. it does not seem to be caused by variations in the fertilization rates males achieve per successful mating event: the number of cross-progeny per mated hermaphrodite was not significantly affected by any factor of the model or the overall model as a whole . at the same time, it is interesting to note that n <dig> males appear to produce more cross-progeny with n <dig> rather than cb <dig> hermaphrodites . this effect may account for the trend of a difference produced by the factor male strain in this context . it is responsible for the significant interaction term, which was inferred for the data from the first two days . one possible explanation for this result is a certain degree of genetic incompatibility, which only becomes visible in one type of cross between the two strains  and which may be related to the recent report of genetic incompatibilities among different natural c. elegans isolates  <cit> .

a, for each cross , the hermaphrodite strain is given first, the male strain last. the mean number of mated hermaphrodites per male, the mean number of offspring per male, the mean number of cross-progeny per male and mated hermaphrodite as well as the mean number of self-progeny per male and mated hermaphrodite are given. se, standard error. statistical results  are shown for the whole model. if the latter shows at least a trend , then the statistical importance of different factors in the model are given. in case of a significant interaction factor , we also provide the results of tukey hsd posthoc tests, whereby significantly different groups are indicated by different superscript captial letters in the top part of the table. the model also included the random factor "experimental date", which did not produced a significant effect  except of the analysis of self-progeny per mated hermaphrodites . significant probabilities are given in bold.

interestingly, n <dig> hermaphrodites always had significantly more self-progeny than cb <dig> – irrespective of the type of the male and irrespective of the cross-progeny produced . this can be explained by their generally higher fertility. in agreement with other authors  <cit>  we found in a separate experiment  that unmated n <dig> hermaphrodites produced more self-progeny than unmated cb <dig> hermaphrodites . in general, our results on total cross-progeny sired by n <dig> males  as well as total self-progeny by n <dig> hermaphrodites  are within the range of previously published data  <cit> .

further dissection of mating behavior
in a separate set of experiments we measured different aspects of mating behavior within either the first one or nine hours. as in the above experiments, we combined an individual male with  <dig> hermaphrodites, although in this case both were always of the same strain . within the first one hour, the different crosses did not show any significant variation, neither regarding the time until first male-hermaphrodite contact , nor in the time until first successful spicule insertions , nor in the number of replicates with successful spicule insertions . we conclude that the cb <dig> males are neither generally better in finding their first mates nor in achieving their first spicule insertion. this result is consistent with the previous finding that n <dig> and cb <dig> show similar behavioral responses to a hermaphrodite-derived cue  <cit> .

however, over  <dig> observation points within the first  <dig> hours, the cb <dig> × cb <dig> crosses produced significantly more male-hermaphrodite contacts  and spicule insertions . from these observations, we conclude that over time cb <dig> males achieve a higher rate of mate contacts and spicule insertions than n <dig> males. these results are in excellent agreement with the results presented in fig.  <dig> and table  <dig>  consequently, an overall higher mating frequency could contribute to the observed higher male persistence in cb <dig> relative to n <dig>  we cannot explain why n <dig> males mate less frequently than cb <dig>  one possibility would be that n <dig> males require a longer time to replenish their sperm stocks. if so, they could produce a smaller number of sperm over their life time which would explain the reduced number of progeny sired.

variation in male sperm competitiveness  could have also affected the observed differences in male persistence. we have not as yet measured this trait. however it is unlikely to have significantly influenced the results on mating efficiency in fig.  <dig>  we followed the mated hermaphrodites until they ceased to produce progeny, presumably because they had used up their supply of sperm . in this case, all male sperm transferred during mating should have contributed to offspring production irrespective of their competitiveness.

consequence of repeated mating of hermaphrodites
in the experiments leading to figure  <dig> and table  <dig> it is likely that individual hermaphrodites mated only once or very few times since they were in excess and they were removed from the males after one day. given the low number of males in natural c. elegans populations, mating only once, if at all, might be realistic. however, in our male maintenance assays , the male frequency was initially set to approximately  <dig> , thus allowing for repeated mating interactions. therefore, we asked whether repeated mating could influence the number of self- as well as cross-progeny. for this purpose, we set up all reciprocal crosses between n <dig> and cb <dig> and, for each cross, single hermaphrodites were mated each day with a virgin male until the hermaphrodite ceased to produce progeny .

in agreement with earlier literature  <cit> , we found that repeated mating  increased the total number of progeny and the proportion of cross-progeny . n <dig> hermaphrodites produced significantly more progeny than cb <dig> hermaphrodites  and the proportion of self-progeny was small. the origin of the male did not make any significant difference . analysis of the first two days only produced essentially identical results . consequently, in the case of repeated mating of hermaphrodites, n <dig> would produce a significantly larger number of cross-progeny and thus a larger proportion of males than cb <dig> 

at first sight, this result appears to contradict our findings from the male maintenance assays, where n <dig> populations loose males rapidly in contrast to cb <dig>  however, hermaphrodites in the repeated mating experiment were exposed to "new" virgin males every day , whereas hermaphrodites in the male maintenance assay encounter the same males over consecutive days, which are likely to show reduced mating efficiency over time . the reduction in mating efficiency is particularly pronounced in n <dig> . therefore, we expect fewer matings, a relatively larger number of self-progeny, and thus a continuous decrease of males in the n <dig> populations over time.

a possible higher cost of multiple mating may further contribute to more rapid initial male decline in n <dig> in the male maintenance assays. repeated mating with increasing numbers of males caused a significant reduction in offspring number in both strains . importantly, this reduction was more pronounced for n <dig>  for which it caused a loss of up to 53% progeny compared to a maximum of about 40% for cb <dig> . consequently, if repeated mating of hermaphrodites did occur in the experimental populations, then the higher costs  of copulations with multiple males for n <dig> should decrease male frequencies and thus outcrossing rates to a larger extent in n <dig> than cb <dig> 

the finding of a cost of multiple mating is likely a consequence of sexual conflict, as reported for a large diversity of organisms  <cit> . one possible explanation for this observation could be increased intra-sexual male-male competition or otherwise detrimental male-male interactions, which were shown in the past to decrease c. elegans male life-span  <cit> . alternatively, it could result from inter-sexual antagonisms such as those mediated by male manipulative substances that are transferred during copulation, in order to enhance male fertilization success  <cit> . in c. elegans, the possible relevance of such inter-sexual conflict was previously indicated by reduced hermaphrodite longevity after mating  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our experiments suggest that the combination of two traits are likely involved in determining the difference in male maintenance between cb <dig> and n2: i) cb <dig> males achieved a larger number of successful copulations and therefore sired more cross-progeny than n <dig>  consequently, a mixed-gender cb <dig> population will contain a larger number of cross-fertilized hermaphrodites and thus produce more males than a corresponding n <dig> population. the resulting higher frequency of males should further enhance cross-fertilization rates in cb <dig>  because male density positively links with hermaphrodite mating rates  <cit> . ii) unmated and singly mated n <dig> hermaphrodites produced a higher number of self-progeny than corresponding cb <dig> hermaphrodites. this parameter reduces male density and thus mating rates in n <dig>  which additionally amplifies the loss of males within n <dig> populations.
