BACKGROUND
the qinghai-tibet plateau, known as the “roof of the world”, is the highest  and largest  highland on the earth. the environmental condition of the plateau is characterized by the reduced oxygen availability, low ambient temperature, high ultraviolent radiation and amid climate. the unique ecological condition imposes severe physiological challenges on inhabits in the high-altitude region. native inhabitants like tibetans have evolved the adaptive mechanism to address the harsh environment during the long history of colonization. today, a number of researchers have identified particular physiological traits favoring local adaption in tibetans. the adaptive traits include increased nitric oxide level, elevated resting ventilation, reduced pulmonary vasoconstrictor response and low hemoglobin concentration compared with acclimated lowlanders .

although the physiological traits in response to high-altitude environments are relatively well characterized, an understanding of the molecular basis underlying these traits has significantly lagged behind. recently, population genomics offers an effective approach to characterize the adaptive mechanism of tibetans and other colonists in the qinghai-tibet plateau. one common approach is involved in genotyping a large number of loci across the genome on divergently differentiated populations, and searching “outliers”  in the extreme tail of the empirical distribution of statistics like fst
 <cit>  and locus-specific branch length  values . to date, a series of genomic scan researches have highlighted more than a dozen of candidate genes subject to natural selection in tibetans . two major candidate genes  in the hypoxia-inducible factor  pathway have been concordantly shown to carry the adaptive mutations  <cit> . both epas1
 <cit>  and egln1
 <cit>  variants are associated with the adaptively low hemoglobin level of tibetans relative to acclimatized lowlanders. recently, a non-synonymous mutation in the egln <dig> gene is suggested to be the causal variant for local adaption in tibetans  <cit> . intriguingly, tibetans show distinct adaptive mechanism as compared to other highland populations including ethiopians  <cit>  and andeans  <cit> , in which different variants in egln <dig> and different selection-nominated candidate genes like bhlhe <dig> have been identified. in non-human species indigenous to the qinghai-tibet plateau, the draft genomes of the tibetan antelope  <cit>  and yak  <cit>  have been recently generated. adaptive signals have been detected in genes associated with oxygen transmission, energy metabolism and dna repair in the two species, improving our understanding of the genetic mechanisms of high-altitude adaptation in highland animals.

the tibetan pig, one of tibetans’ domestic animals, is originally distributed in farming and farming-pastoral regions at altitudes of  <dig>  -  <dig>  m in the qinghai-tibetan plateau  <cit> . like tibetans and other colonists in the plateau, tibetan pigs have several key adaptive features for coping with the harsh environment at high altitude  <cit> . first, they have black skin and hair with long and dense bristle that protect them from high solar radiation and cold ambient temperature in winter . second, their well-developed heart and lung may be required for the increased rate of blood flow and oxygen transportation to tissues in response to hypoxia. third, they have developed a blunted erythropoietic response to high-altitude hypoxia by exhibiting lower than expected hemoglobin concentrations relative to their lowland counterparts and acclimatized lowland pigs  <cit> . this feature, in contrast to tibetan yak, goat and sheep that show elevated hemoglobin levels at high altitude, is a crucial protection mechanism for excessive erythrocytosis  in tibetans . forth, their alertness and agility enable them to survive in the grazing condition.figure  <dig>

to elucidate the genetic basis of the altitude phenotypes in tibetan pigs, we have previously searched for population-differentiated snps across the genome between two tibetan pig populations and  <dig> lowland breeds using the illumina 60 k snp data. we identified several candidate genes that might play a role in high-altitude adaptation in tibetan pigs  <cit> . more recently, li et al.  <cit>  characterize fast evolved genes in tibetan pigs and highlight a set of genes that may contribute to high-altitude adaptation using whole-genome sequence data. the two studies treated all tibetan pigs as a single population. however, the qinghai-tibet plateau stretches across a vast region. several geographically isolated populations of the tibetan pig are currently living in the region, including sichuan, yunnan, gansu and tibet populations  <cit> . environmental factors including temperature, humidity, precipitation and vegetation are variable across the hypoxic and high-ultraviolet plateau  <cit> . therefore, different tibetan geographical populations may have experienced independent adaptive mechanism for the harsh environment. besides, it remains an open question whether tibetan pig populations have experienced differentiation and subdivisions during the long period of their colonization in the plateau.

here we genotyped a broad panel of  <dig> pigs from  <dig> tibetan regional populations and  <dig> lowland breeds using high-density snp genotyping arrays. by applying population genetic and genomic approaches, we characterize the genetic landscape for tibetan pigs and reveal both population-shared and -specific candidate genes contributing to local adaptations in the  <dig> tibetan populations. our findings provide novel insights into evolutionary history of tibetan pigs and the genetic architecture of high-altitude adaptation in highland animals and their owners.

RESULTS
population structure and evolution history of tibetan pigs
to investigate population structure of tibetan pigs, we first constructed a neighbor-joining  tree based on genome-wide allele sharing of the  <dig> pigs from  <dig> tibetan populations,  <dig> chinese lowland breeds  and  <dig> western breeds . a notable feature of the nj tree is the high concordance with which individuals cluster to their population origin. the topological tree  clearly illustrates that all individuals from the same population or breed gather together, and western pigs form a cluster separating from chinese indigenous pigs. the genetic relationships between chinese breeds are strikingly concordant with their geographic locations. for instance, erhualian, meishan, jiangquhai, jinhua, tongcheng, ganxi and shaziling from the middle-lower belt of yangtze river defined a separate grouping, while breeds from south china and southwest china including luchuan, wuzhishan, bamaxiang, dahuabai, congjiang xiang and diannan pigs appeared as a closely related cluster. intriguingly, five tibetan regional populations did not form a separate cluster. instead, tibetan pigs from gansu province were more closely related to north china breeds like bamei and hetao than to any of the other tibetan populations. moreover, tibetan pigs from sichuan and yunnan provinces were grouped together with their geographic neighbors, rongchang and neijiang. the two populations  in the tibet autonomous region clustered in an independent clade.

to better understand the population structure of tibetan pigs, we further performed a principal component analysis  using a subset of  <dig>  snps with low linkage disequilibrium  extents  in all tested pigs. the pca plot  shows the differentiation pattern between chinese and western pigs that is highly consistent the nj tree results. the differentiation patterns of the five tibetan regional populations resemble the nj results. the tibetan pigs from yunnan and sichuan provinces exhibit strong genetic affinity to their geographic neighbors including neijing and rongchang, whereas the gansu tibetan population cluster near their neighbors, bamei and hetao pigs. the gongbujiang and milin populations are more genetically similar to each other than to any of the other tibetan populations.

to assess evolutionary origin and historical admixture patterns of tibetan pigs in a context of worldwide populations, we further conducted a bayesian ancestry inference analysis using the program admixture . within chinese pigs, from k =  <dig> to k =  <dig>  variable fractions of chinese wild ancestry were evidenced. at k =  <dig> and  <dig>  five ancestry fractions were detected in chinese breeds, including the ancestors of gongbujiangda tibetan, congjiang xiang, luchan, jinhua and erhualian pigs. when we focused on tibetan pigs, the gansu tibetan population was derived from two ancestry fractions of gongbujiangda tibetan  and erhualian  pigs, and its ancestry structure was similar to their geographic neighbors: bamei and hetao pigs. the ancestry structures of tibetan pigs from sichuan and yunnan were nearly identical, which consist of 75% of gongbujiangda tibetan, 10% of luchuan and 15% of erhualian ancestry fractions and resemble the structures of their lowland neighbors including neijing, rongchang and mingguang pigs.

to further infer population splits and mixtures of tibetan pigs, we used a recently developed approach, treemix  <cit> , to construct a maximum-likelihood tree of the  <dig> tibetan populations,  <dig> chinese lowland breeds and  <dig> chinese wild boar population. a close examination of residuals from the inferred tree without migration events  revealed that  <dig> pairs of populations were apparently not compatible with the best-fit tree, suggestive of gene flow events. indeed, the tree model without migration events only explained  <dig> % of the variance in the relatedness between populations. we sequentially added migration events to the maximum-likelihood tree . the new tree model allowing  <dig> major migration events explained higher percentage  of the variance in the relatedness between populations. in the inferred graph , the regional populations from tibet, yunnan and sichuan provinces were grouped into one of the two major groupings, whereas the gansu tibetan population clusters with the other major grouping consisting of bamei and hetao pigs. an ancestral edge further divided tibet and yunnan/sichuan populations into different subgroups. again, yunan and sichuan tibetan populations clustered with their geographic neighbors neijiang and rongchang. of the six migration events, the strongest signal suggests a genetic contribution from the ancestry of tongcheng, shaziling and ganxi breeds to dongshan pigs  =  <dig> %). another visually apparent event is a gene flow from the ancestry of wuzhishan and luchuan pigs into diannan pigs . we also inferred a significant admixture event from meishan to hetao individuals . for tibetan pigs, we found a gene flow event from the early gansu tibetan population into the ancestry of the other four tibetan populations with a migration weight of  <dig> %.figure  <dig>

taken together, we conclude that tibetan pig geographic populations have experienced substantial genetic differentiation and population admixture. during the formation of current populations, tibetan pigs were likely influenced by their geographic neighbors. tibetan pigs are thus not a single breed, which appear to be  <dig> independent populations corresponding to the tibetan, gansu, and sichuan & yunnan locations .

population-specific genomic signatures of selection in tibetan pigs
according to the above-mentioned population genetic analyses, we divided tibetan pigs into three independent populations: tibet, gansu and scyn. to identify population-specific loci under positive selection in tibetan pigs, we calculated the lsbl value for each of the  <dig>  informative snps along the genome using a three-group contrasting model: one tibetan population, one chinese lowland group and the other two tibetan populations . the three-group test identified snp outliers that had highly differentiated allele frequencies in one tibetan population relative to the other two groups. these outlier snps are candidate loci  under selection for adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia.

we identified a total of  <dig> snp outliers , corresponding to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> candidate genes  in gansu, tibet and scyn populations, respectively . few common signals were found between the three tibetan populations . c9orf <dig>  grin2b and grid <dig>  three functionally plausible genes , exhibited the most significant signals of selection in gansu, tibet and scyn populations, respectively . these snps showed a marked allele frequency difference between one tibetan population and the other tibetan and lowland populations .figure  <dig>

we sequentially performed gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway enrichment analyses on highlighted candidate genes in each tibetan pig population. go analysis identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> overrepresented genes in gansu, tibet and scyn populations, respectively . these genes are involved in several biological processes that likely play a role in local adaptation of tibetan pigs, such as neuron-neuron synaptic transmission , detection of mechanical stimulus involved in sensory perception , artery development , positive regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation  and glutamate receptor signaling pathway . we also identified  <dig> and  <dig> kegg pathways in gansu and tibet populations  that were overrepresented after correction for multiple testing: basal cell carcinoma , circadian entrainment , nicotine addiction  and adherens junction  pathways in the gansu population, and propanoate metabolism , sulfur metabolism  and dna replication  in the tibet population.table  <dig>

population-shared genomic signatures in all tibetan pigs
to test if tibetan pig populations have common adaptive loci for the plateau, we also looked across the genome to identity signals of selection using the three-group test model with all tibetan pigs as one group and two chinese lowland groups . a total of  <dig> snp outliers were visualized on the top  <dig> % of the empirical distribution, corresponding to  <dig> genes . the lsbl value plots and allele distribution patterns of the top three loci are depicted in figure  <dig>  each top locus shows highly differentiation pattern between tibetan pigs and chinese lowland animals. for instance, at the top of the list is an intergenic snp between hfm <dig> and znf <dig> . allele c at the snp is predominantly presented in tibetan pigs with average frequency of  <dig>  whereas is much rarer in chinese lowland breeds at an average frequency of  <dig>  except for neijiang , a breed known for its well adaptability to diverse environmental conditions  <cit> . the biological role of hfm <dig> and znf <dig> in response to hypoxia has not been established and warrants further investigations. the second strongest lsbl snp  is located at 12 kb upstream of the pla2g12a gene, a biologically plausible gene . the third strongest outlier is located at ~17 kb downstream of a hypoxia-inducible gene: rgcc.

go analysis identified  <dig> overrepresented genes that are involved in the regulation of collagen metabolic process , histone h3-k <dig> methylation , positive regulation of positive chemotaxis , regulation of cytokinesis , fatty acid catabolism , detection of mechanical stimulus involved insensory perception of pain , and behavioral defense response  . meanwhile, we found  <dig> kegg pathwaysthat were overrepresented after correction for multiple testing: valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation , fat digestion and absorption  and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  . kegg: <dig>  is particular interesting as it may reflect gene selection for fully utilizing fat as an energy source in case of food shortage, a critical ecological factor restricting the viability of highland animals.

signatures of selection in three well-characterized hypoxia genes
egln <dig> and epas <dig>  two critical regulators in the hif pathway, have been repeatedly identified as targets of selection for high-altitude adaptation in tibetans . adam <dig> is the most prominent locus showing signal of positive selection in the tibetan yak  <cit> . we, therefore, are interested in whether any of the three genes has experienced convergent selection in tibetan pigs. as no snp on the current porcine 60 k chip is located around the three genomic regions, we sequentially genotyped  <dig> snps at an average density of  <dig> snp/ <dig>  kb covering the three genes on a panel of  <dig> individuals including  <dig> tibetan pigs and  <dig> lowland animals. the resulting genotype data were merged into the 60 k snp dataset. we then performed the lsbl analysis on the  <dig> individuals using a common subset of informative snps. no significant selection signal was detected at both egln <dig> and adam <dig> loci . two of  <dig> snps around the epas <dig> gene appeared to be population-shared outliers surpassing the significance threshold . the two snps showed apparently different variation patterns between tibetan pigs and low-altitude individuals .

comparison of our findings with previous reports
as shown in figure  <dig>  a majority of candidate genes implicated in the current study are distinct from those hypoxia genes identified in tibetans , other highlanders  and tibetan antelope  <cit>  and yak  <cit> . we argue that tibetan pigs may have evolved a different biological adaptation mechanism. even compared with the recent findings of hypoxia-related genes in tibetan pigs based on the whole-genome sequence data  <cit> , most of candidate genes including those ranking in the top list of the current study  are reported for the first time.figure  <dig>

discussion
population history of tibetan pigs
the formation of tibetan present-day pig populations was likely influenced by the migration of their owners: tibetans. today, both archaeological and genetic data support an ancient initial colonization of modern humans in the early upper paleolithic before the last glacial maximum  and a recent population expansion and gene flow from outside the highland region in the early neolithic   <cit> . the recent migration events are believed to bring agriculture into the himalayan region, leading to the establishment of farming and yak pastoralism on the plateau  <cit> . since then, the trade between the tibet and southeastern/northeastern china lasted for thousands of years through three major routines: the tangbo ancient road and the tea-horse ancient road including the yunnan-tibet and the sichuan-tibet routes. the tangbo ancient road extends from chang’an  to lhasa. historically, it was a very important trade route linking the upper yellow river region and the tibet especially during the dang dynasty . the tea-horse ancient road played a crucial role in communication and exchange between the residents of yunnan, sichuan and tibet. it had been flourishing for over a century until the end of world war ii. the long-standing trade likely brought along human-mediated dispersal of lowland pigs in southwestern and northwestern china into the tibetan plateau. genetic data from mitochondria dna support a local domestication origin of tibetan pigs  <cit> . however, there were multiple migrations of tibetan ancestors at different times from different places and ample trade exchanges between the tibet and the outside regions. this leads us to assume that the genetic makeup of current tibetan pig populations may be influenced by their lowland neighbors, leading to population subdivisions of tibetan pigs. the hypothesis is supported by our following observations.  in the pca results, pc <dig> axis separated tibetan pig populations into different groupings corresponding to their geographic locations.  in the nj phylogenetic tree, the gansu tibetan population defined an independent branch with its neighbors including the bamei pig in qinghai and the hetao pig in inner mongolia. the sichuan and yunnan tibetan populations formed another cluster together with two lowland neighbors  in the sichuan basin. the two local populations from the tibet appeared to be a distinct clade.  the treemix analysis showed the evolutionary splits between the tibetan populations. the gansu tibetan population was assigned to one ancient major group separating from the other tibetan pig populations. again, sichuan and yunnan tibetan populations together with neijiang and rongchang defined a subgroup separating from the tibet populations. these findings collectively support the contribution of geographically neighboring lowland populations to the today’s tibetan populations. the historical admixture events, at least to a certain extent, are responsible for the substantial inter-population differentiation in tibetan pigs. altogether, we believe that tibetan pig populations have experienced distinct demographic histories and have various degree of admixture with different neighboring populations. in general, tibetan pigs can be divided into  <dig> independent populations: tibet, gansu and sichuan & yunnan.

distinct selection-nominated loci in different tibetan pig populations
in tibetans, a list of genes has been highlighted as potential targets of natural selection . while epas <dig> and egln <dig> at the top list are consistently identified in multiple tibetan studies, many of these selection candidate genes are unique to each study. such differences may be at least partly attributed to different demographic histories and genetic differentiation among tibetan populations that likely have various degree of admixture with different neighboring populations  <cit> . tibetan pigs show similar population history patterns to their owners. as mentioned above, our genetic data suggest long-term population isolation and genetic differentiation among tibetan pig populations with potential for admixture with geographic neighbors. it is therefore reasonable to speculate that each of tibetan pig population may have unique adaptive variants. our genome scans on individual population confirm the speculation. the snp outliers in one population are largely different from the others . especially, the top snps corresponding to c9orf <dig>  grin2b and grid <dig> genes exhibit population specific signals in the gansu, tibet and sichuan & yunan populations, respectively . these candidate genes are worthy mentioning because of their statistical significance and function implications. further investigations of their potential role in the high-altitude adaptation of tibetan pigs are worthwhile.

c9orf <dig>  also known as aminopeptidase o, encodes a member of the m <dig> zinc aminopeptidase family that catalyzes the hydrolysis of amino acid residues from the n-terminus of peptide. c9orf <dig> is involved in the renin-angiotensin pathway, in which c9orf <dig> cleaves angiotensin iii to generate angiotensin iv  <cit> . it is known that angiotensin iv regulates the vasoconstriction  <cit>  and the hydromineral balance as well as arterial blood pressure  <cit> . moreover, high expression level of c9orf <dig> is positively correlated with maximal oxygen uptake and the percentage of type  <dig> fibers in humans  <cit> . as predicted by malacards  <cit> , c9orf <dig> is associated with newborn respiratory distress syndrome. therefore, preferential selection on the c9orf <dig> gene is likely required for tibetan  pigs to increase oxygen uptake and avoid pulmonary or cerebral vascular hypertension and edema during the long-standing living in the hypoxic highland.

grin2b encodes a subunit of n-methyl-d-apartate receptor that is the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter receptor in the mammalian brain. the receptor has a central role in memory and cognitive function. defects in the grin2b gene have been found in human patients with mental retardation  <cit> . grid <dig> encodes glutamate receptor delta  <dig>  a subunit of glutamate receptor channels that mediate most of the fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and play key roles in synaptic plasticity  <cit> . variations in the promoter region of the grid <dig> gene have been associated with human schizophrenia  <cit> . positive selection of these genes may suggest the importance of neural regulation in the establishment of quickly response to attack under grazing conditions in tibetan pigs.

common selection targets in tibetan pigs
in addition to population-specific candidate loci, we highlighted a list of selection-nominated candidate genes shared by all tibetan pigs. many of these genes are functionally related to energy metabolism, angiogenesis, melanin synthesis and behavior defense response. of note, pla2g12a and rgcc in our top-ranking list stand out as strong candidate genes that likely play a role in high-altitude adaptation in tibetan pigs.

pla2g12a encodes secreted phospholipase a <dig>  group xiia enzyme. the enzyme hydrolyzes phospholipids into arachidonic acid and other lipophilic molecules that exert a variety of biological effects. of note, arachidonic acid plays an important role in regulation of pulmonary vascular tone in lungs of both newborns and adults. in pigs and other species, arachidonic acid can induce dilation in pulmonary arteries. altered arachidonic acid metabolites have been implicated in the development of pulmonary hypertension in chronically hypoxic piglets  <cit> . therefore, pla2g12a is a strong candidate gene contributing to high-altitude adaptation in tibetan pigs. high frequencies of pla2g12a favorable mutations in tibetan pigs could be beneficial for increasing blood flow at low degree of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension.

rgcc plays a critical role in hypoxia-induced antiangiogenesis. it has a physical interaction with hif1α and vascular endothelial growth factor  that are key mediators in cellular response to hypoxia and ischemia  <cit> . in response to acute hypoxia, hif1α activates the expression of vegf that is critically important for skeletal muscle angiogenesis. the increased growth of blood vessels has been associated with capillary leak  <cit> . therefore, the preferentially selected variants in the rgcc gene may inhibit the capillary growth and consequently avoid capillary leak in tibetan pigs under long-term exposure to the hypoxic environment.

epas <dig>  the “master regulator” of erythropoiesis in the hif pathway , also appear to be a target of selection in this study. epas <dig> allelic variants that are common in tibetan pigs may be loss of function and be negative associated with hemoglobin concentrations as a blunted erythropoietic response observed in tibetans and tibetan pigs . it should be noted that the other well-characterized hypoxia gene egln <dig> is not a target of selection in tibetan pigs.

a complex picture of the genetic mechanism underlying high-altitude adaptation in tibetan pigs
in this study, we identified a total of  <dig> genes as potential selection targets in all tibetan pig populations . a majority of these candidate genes have not been implicated in previous genome-wide studies on highlanders and high-altitude animals. many genes are functionally related to high-altitude physiology, such as angiogenesis , pulmonary hypertension remodeling , oxygen intake , neural response , melanin synthesis  and heart development . further characterization of these genes will be necessary to identify variants responsible for the observed signals. both distinct and shared genomic signatures of selection were illustrated in tibetan regional pig populations. we argue that both independent and shared adaptive variants could be responsible for local adaptation in each tibetan pig population. our findings reflect a complex picture of the genetic mechanism underlying high-altitude adaptation in tibetan pigs. the adaptive mechanism seems to involve a range of genes regulating diverse biological processes. distinct set of genes including some broadly shared loci act in a highly coordinated manner to offset severe physiological challenges imposed by the harsh hypoxic environment in different tibetan pig populations.

future analyses
our analysis provides a list of potential genes involved in high-altitude adaptation in tibetan pigs, which will be the ground for future investigations. it is worthwhile to conduct resequencing of the most promising genomic regions. haplotype similarity analysis based on the resequencing-called variants would allow us to identify tibetan specific and minimal-shared haplotypes. the functional variants residing in these haplotypes, such as protein-altering mutations and regulatory mutations at the evolutionary conserved sites, would be strong candidate causative mutations.

although we identified a list of candidate genes for high-altitude adaptation in tibetan pigs, we are limited by the ascertainment bias and low genomic coverage of our snp dataset. the 60 k snps on the illumina porcine dna chip were primarily characterized from western pigs that have relatively higher ld extents compared to tibetan pigs  <cit> . a mass of tibetan specific variants are not included in the chip. therefore, we must not have the power to identify all variants under positive selection for local adaptation of tibetan pigs. own to the substantially decreasing cost, whole-genome sequencing is now affordable in domestic animals. such population-scale genome analyses on a broad sample of representative individuals would identify additional adaptive variants and further improve our understanding of the genetic basis of high-altitude adaptation in tibetan pigs.

CONCLUSIONS
tibetan pig populations have experienced substantial genetic differentiation. geographically neighboring lowland breeds likely contributed to tibetan pigs by historical admixture events. the present-day tibetan pigs can be divided into  <dig> independent populations: tibet, gansu and sichuan & yunnan. after a long period of colonization in the qinghai-tibetan plateau, tibetan pigs have developed a complex biological adaptation mechanism that could be different from that of tibetans and other highland animals. different tibetan pig populations appear to have both distinct and convergent adaptive loci for the harsh environment of the plateau.
