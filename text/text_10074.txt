BACKGROUND
the widespread use of dense single-nucleotide polymorphism  assays for genomic prediction has led to the creation of large reference populations across multiple countries and breeds  <cit> . previous studies have utilized these assays to identify and characterize regions of the genome that have undergone positive selection, referred to as selection signatures  <cit> . selection signatures are characterized by distributions of nucleotides around favorable mutations that differ statistically from that expected purely by chance due to directional selection increasing the frequency of the favorable allele over time  <cit> . nucleotides linked to the favorable mutation also tend to increase in frequency a phenomenon referred to as “hitchhiking”  <cit> . a recent study by kemper et al.  <cit>  provided evidence that locating signatures of selection is difficult for complex traits due to hundreds of loci associated with the trait undergoing weak selection. even though a selection signature is difficult to detect for complex traits, selection does change the allele frequency of loci associated with the trait. turchin et al.  <cit>  showed that specific alleles of snp associated with human height were at a higher frequency in northern than southern europe, which mirrors observations of differences in height in european populations.

a potential alternative to detect signatures of selection for complex traits may be to characterize regions of the genome that have a higher likelihood of occurring within a continuous run of homozygosity   <cit> . a roh is generated when an individual receives a haplotype that is identical by descent from each parent  <cit> . furthermore, parents can pass on identical chromosomal segments to a child even when the relationship between them is a very distant one, which creates a continuum of homozygous length, depending on the degree of shared ancestry and its age  <cit> . in dairy cattle the use of artificial insemination has allowed elite bulls to produce thousands of progeny, resulting in a high frequency of familial relationships within the pedigree, potentially giving rise to a high and non-uniform distribution of roh frequency across the genome within a given population. utilizing a roh based metric, referred to as locus autozygosity, on united states  holstein sires, kim et al.  <cit>  showed that differences in the location and distribution of roh regions varied across groups that underwent different degrees of selection pressure. furthermore, multiple regions that they declared as different were found to be associated with milk yield traits.

in general dairy cattle breeding programs have similar breeding objectives, regardless of country, that are driven by traits of economic importance such as milk, fat and protein yield along with fertility, longevity and conformation. the environments and management conditions in which individual animals perform differ greatly across countries. this is confirmed by genetic correlations varying from  <dig>  to  <dig>  between us and new zealand  and us and australia  for milk, fat and protein yield  <cit> . furthermore, the relative importance of a given trait varies across countries potentially giving rise to different selection pressures across the genome. selection in north america is mainly practiced in environments where confinement and total mixed ration are typical management settings, in comparison to nz and au where performance is predominantly in pasture based systems. different management systems may lead to variation in the importance of a given genomic region, thereby differentially increasing the frequency of favorable alleles. for example, kolver et al.  <cit>  confirmed that north american holstein-friesian cows have a greater capacity to convert feed to milk when fed a total mixed ration type diet in comparison to cows from nz. studies involving holsteins have confirmed that the nz holstein is genetically different than holstein derived from other european and north american countries  <cit> . recently pryce et al.  <cit>  combined genotype panels on holstein animals from multiple research herds  and conducted a pca analysis on the genomic relationship matrix  and found slight differences across research herds with the greatest difference arising in the nz population compared to the other research herds.

a limited number of studies have investigated genetic differences across countries within the jersey breed  <cit> . characterizing what causes these subtle changes at the genomic level within the jersey dairy cattle breed is worthwhile because of the higher levels of inbreeding and smaller effective population size in jerseys when compared to the holstein breed  <cit> . furthermore, lower correlations of production and fertility traits evaluated in northern  and southern  hemisphere countries have been estimated for the jersey breed in comparison to the holstein breed  <cit> , which could make detection of regions of the genome that are under differential selection across countries more insightful. also, in comparison to the holstein breed, there has been somewhat less international gene exchange, therefore characterizing differences across population could allow for more efficient collaborations to enhance genomic improvement. the objective of this study was to characterize differences and similarities in the location and frequency of homozygosity related measures of jersey dairy cows and bulls from the united states us, au and nz.

RESULTS
population stratification and average homozygosity across the genome
the populations utilized to make comparisons across populations consisted of a subset of genotyped jersey cows born in the us  and au  and jersey progeny tested bulls from the us , au  and nz . the snp in common across the  <dig> cow and  <dig> bull populations totaled  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. each sex was analyzed separately as different selection pressures are likely to exist across sexes and a higher level of diversity is expected within the cow populations. the number of animals within a year on the complete set is outlined in table  <dig>  to assess the degree of differentiation across populations, a principal component analysis  on the genomic relationship matrix constructed separately for the cows and bulls based on yang et al.  <cit>  was used. also, a traditional measure of population differentiation, wrights fst statistic, was computed as outlined by weir & cockerham  <cit>  and reported as the average fst of a moving  <dig> snp window. measures used to characterize the homozygosity averaged across the genome included the proportion of the genome that is homozygous and the proportion of the genome that is contained within a roh. using a sliding window approach, a roh was declared when a region of  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> contiguous homozygous snp with no heterozygotes was observed.table  <dig>

characterizing the frequency of autozygosity across and within populations
in order to detect subtle differences across the genome in the location and length of long stretches of homozygosity, the roh metric of snp length  <dig>  described by kim et al.  <cit> , was calculated. the roh <dig> metric has advantages over conventional roh because it captures the number of times a snp is in a roh without declaring the beginning and end of a roh. therefore, animals with slightly different start and stop sites for a particular roh region will still be grouped into a snp that is in a roh region which is illustrated graphically in figure  <dig>  the roh <dig> value for each snp was compared across the two populations using a chi-square test and a statistical threshold determined using a permutation test  <cit> . a region was declared different across populations when at least  <dig> contiguous significant  snp were detected in a region greater than 4 mb. regions of high roh <dig> frequency  that were at least  <dig> contiguous snp and greater than 4 mb across all populations were considered similar across populations.figure  <dig>

regions with high levels of autozygosity for all populations were detected on bta <dig>  and bta <dig> , as shown in figure  <dig>  across all populations the location of the maximum roh <dig> frequency for bta <dig> and bta <dig> was between  <dig>  -  <dig>  and  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb, respectively. multiple regions of the genome displayed different autozygosity frequencies as outlined in table  <dig> and displayed graphically in figure  <dig>  the number of regions that were different across populations was greatest for the us and nz bull comparison, which is in agreement with the difference between the two populations obtained by the principal component analysis and by the fst metric.figure  <dig>

characterizing the change in autozygosity within each population
the change of locus autozygosity  across time was modeled using logistic regression of autozygosity on year of birth, where there were at least  <dig> genotyped animals. initially the analysis was conducted on both bulls and cows, but no regions were found to be significant for the cows, possibly due to the narrow range in birth year of cows  in comparison to the bulls. therefore only the bull results are presented.

multiple regions have undergone changes in autozygosity across time for the us and au bull population, although no regions were significant for nz . the us bull population had  <dig> regions that have undergone autozygosity change across time and they are located on bta <dig>  and bta <dig> . the two regions located on bta <dig> were also shown to have different roh <dig> frequencies across populations. the au bull population had  <dig> regions that have undergone autozygosity change across time and they are both located on bta <dig> . figure  <dig> clearly displays that differences across the genomes in the frequency of roh regions exist, although the exact mechanism by which these occur, such as selection or drift cannot be disentangled.

effect of regions of high autozygosity or large differences across populations on yield traits
regions that had differential roh <dig> frequencies across population, high roh <dig> frequencies in common across all population, and regions that have undergone significant autozygosity change across time were further investigated  to determine if snp within these regions are associated with traits of economic importance. yield deviations  for cows that were derived from standardized lactation milk, fat and protein yield were weighted according to garrick et al.  <cit>  and a single marker regression model on the subset of snp was used to describe the association between a trait and snp. markers with p-values smaller than  <dig>  were declared significant. the false discovery rate  was calculated for each trait according to benjamini and hochberg  <cit> .

multiple regions contained snp that were associated with milk, fat and protein yield and the fdr for milk, fat and protein yield was  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. the region with the largest number of snp was on bta <dig>  and included  <dig> snp associated with fat yield. furthermore, a region on bta <dig>  had  <dig> snp associated with fat yield and a region on bta <dig> had  <dig> snp associated with milk yield. a complete list of the regions in addition to candidate genes are presented in additional file 2: table s <dig>  a gene network analysis revealed a network involved in immune system function for milk yield  involving  <dig> genes that are outlined in additional file 3: figure s <dig> with  <dig> genes below the  <dig>  threshold on bta <dig> , bta <dig>  and bta <dig>  and the remaining  <dig> below the  <dig>  threshold.

discussion
the current study characterized the frequency and distribution of roh across cow and bull populations derived from us, au and nz. previous reports across multiple dairy breeds have similarly found that the nz population is genetically different from other dairy cattle populations  <cit> . the correlations published by interbull for milk, fat and protein yield  <cit>  for the jersey breed between us and nz is weaker, i.e. further away from  <dig>  in comparison to au and nz. as the genetic correlation deviates from  <dig> it indicates that the expression of the trait is different across environments  <cit> . a traditional method to examine the degree of differentiation is to compute wright’s fst statistic across two populations. the use of this measure is advantageous when large differences in allele frequencies occur, such as across cattle breeds. within a breed, small differences in allele frequencies are expected across populations and particularly when there is some degree of genetic exchange, as is the case of the jersey population. due to this the usefulness of fst to determine regions that are different within a breed is reduced, therefore alternative methods were used.

one such alternative method to characterize the genomic differences across populations is to compute the average or a specific region’s roh frequency. the roh metric has previously been used to examine population history  <cit>  and as an alternative inbreeding metric  <cit> . recently, kim et al.  <cit>  characterized the variation in roh frequency in us holstein dairy cattle utilizing an unselected holstein population compared to two heavily selected holstein populations. the mean number of roh per individual was significantly lower in the unselected population than the two selected populations  <cit> . this study confirms that there are also differences in roh levels across populations within the same breed, which may be due to different selection intensities across countries or different thresholds on the levels of allowable consanguineous matings.

furthermore, kim et al.  <cit>  found that several of the regions that had differing levels of roh across populations were associated with economically important traits including milk, fat and protein yield. the same approach was utilized in this study to detect signatures of selection in common and different across populations. two regions on bta <dig> and bta <dig> were found to have high roh <dig> frequencies across all populations. previous studies have also found selection signatures on the same region of bta <dig>  <cit> , which contains the slc35a <dig> gene at  <dig>  mb. a mutation in this gene is known to cause a lethal recessive mutation in holstein dairy cattle known as complex vertebral malformations   <cit> . a lethal mutation would not give rise to the high level of autozygosity surrounding the cvm mutation, although selection at a nearby linked locus could potentially cause the region to have high levels of autozygosity. the selection signature on bta <dig> confirms the findings of kemper et al. in several cattle breeds  <cit>  and qanbari et al. in fleckvieh cattle  <cit>  and harbors multiple olfactory genes. olfactory receptors detect and identify a wide range of odors, providing a cue for the animal to interact with its environment. furthermore, gene duplications within the beef cattle genome tend to encode genes that interface with the external environment such as olfactory receptors  <cit> , suggesting that they may be under strong selection for newly evolving functions.

multiple regions of the genome displayed different autozygosity and interestingly, regions that were different across the us and nz bull populations are similar to the results described by kim et al.  <cit>  where the comparison was between selected versus unselected holstein populations. the regions include bta <dig> , bta <dig> , bta <dig> , bta <dig> , bta <dig>  and bta <dig> . this suggests that selection for yield has resulted in similar regions of high roh <dig> frequency across different breeds.

furthermore, snp within regions that have undergone a significant autozygosity change have previously been reported to be associated with milk yield traits. the snp with the largest significance within bta <dig>  and bta <dig>  were within 1 mb of snp that have been previously shown to be associated with milk, fat and protein yield and fat and protein percentage, respectively  <cit> . it is unsurprising that no regions have undergone a significant autozygosity change in the nz population, given their rather low and relatively uniform level of autozygosity across the genome in comparison to the greater variability in length and location of roh in au and us.

functional analysis of genes within 500 kb in both directions of the significant snp revealed regions involved in behavior , milk fat synthesis , fatty acid metabolism , and metabolism . a previous study that investigated selection signatures across multiple beef and dairy breeds found a sweep region on bta <dig> containing nbea  <cit> , which could be associated with traits associated with behavior  <cit> . fatty acid binding proteins such as fabp <dig> are one of the key intracellular fa transporters and is highly expressed in the mammary gland  <cit> . in general the favorable allele that was associated with the yield trait based on estimated snp effects from a single marker regression model using the current dataset had a higher frequency in the us population in comparison to au or nz, which has lower levels of milk production, although other reasons may have caused allele frequencies to drift other than solely selection such as random genetic drift.

the gene network involving immune function is unsurprising due to a strong selection emphasis towards traits involving milk production which has led to a more pronounced negative relationship with metabolic, reproduction and health fitness traits  <cit> . in a study by parker-gaddis et al.  <cit>  using us holstein data, the genetic correlation for fitness traits such as ketosis, lameness, mastitis, metritis, and retained placenta were all negative with the us net merit index  <cit> . furthermore, the particular environment that an animal is managed in may differentially compromise the host immunity and increase the incidence of variety of diseases  <cit>  thereby augmenting the selection pressure on a given region. for the genes involved in immune function the frequency of the favorable allele based on estimated snp effects from a single marker regression model using the current dataset was not consistently higher in a particular population.

combining snp assay data across multiple countries was initially aimed at increasing the reliability of genomic breeding value estimates  <cit> . nonetheless, other potential uses can be garnered from the multi-country collaboration. one example, may be to use this a priori knowledge of the location of these genomic differences in mating schemes in order to decrease the level of homozygosity in the progeny at the genomic level. the availability of a multi-country reference population allows for the detection of a diverse set of haplotypes, which could potentially be exploited using methods such as optimum-contribution selection methodologies  <cit>  that weights selection response versus future inbreeding. furthermore, a multi-country reference population increases the likelihood of detecting selection candidates with favorable but different combinations of chromosomal segments  <cit> . relationship matrices that characterize the similarity of haplotype segments  <cit>  may allow for a more effective progeny inbreeding penalty. a sizable body of literature exists on using genomic information to constrain parental relationships and control the rate of inbreeding or level of homozygosity  <cit> . in general these methods constrain relationships averaged across the genome, although pryce et al.  <cit>  confirmed that certain regions have a larger impact on inbreeding depression than other regions. therefore, optimum-contribution selection algorithms that incorporate this a priori knowledge of regions that have a large impact on inbreeding depression and different levels of roh across countries, may be more effective in controlling homozygosity at the genomic level and minimizing inbreeding depression. in order for genomic information to be utilized in mating designs whole herd genotyping is required, which currently is not a common practice. as the technology improves and the cost of low-density genotyping platforms decreases, mating designs that utilize genomic information could assist producers in managing their herd at the genomic level.

some limitations of the current study regarding roh distribution and frequency could stem from the maf threshold chosen, that may have resulted in removing snp that have a low maf in one population and higher maf in another population, or snp near fixation in all populations. as a consequence, potential regions that are similar and different across populations may not be detected if they are near fixation in one or more populations. this editing procedure was used because the detection of “hard sweep” selection signatures involving breed defining traits such as coat color or polledness was not the primary emphasis in this study. also, it has been shown that the medium density snp panel is not sensitive enough for the precise determination of short roh segments  <cit> . a high density snp panel was not available across all populations, but we anticipate that denser panels  should help to disentangle the selective history for short segments. lastly, criteria used for inclusion of individuals in the genotyped populations may not be similar across populations, which may have resulted in genotyped animals in some of the populations not necessarily being representative of the animals within the given country. multiple editing procedures were here used to minimize this phenomenon in order to make comparisons meaningful.

CONCLUSIONS
regions that displayed differential roh <dig> frequencies across bull and cow resource populations from us, au and nz were characterized and the largest difference was between the us and nz population which was in line with the pca analysis. regions of the genome that had high levels of autozygosity across all populations were found on bta <dig> and bta <dig>  furthermore a proportion of the regions that were different across populations were associated with milk yield traits. these subtle populations differences could potentially be exploited at the animal level in order to design mating schemes, that are tailored toward maximizing the level of heterozygosity along with superior additive genetics in the progeny, which will be the focus of future research.
