BACKGROUND
the mammalian homologues of the drosophila transient receptor potential  channel are plasma membrane cation channels sharing significant sequence homology and a common structure. in mice  <dig> genes have been described coding for trp proteins  <cit> . the superfamily of trp channels has been divided into six subfamilies in mammals, trpc, trpv, trpm, trpa, trpp and trpml according to structural similarities and modes of activation  <cit> . the members of subfamilies trpc, trpv, trpm and trpa comprise the group  <dig> trps, since trpp and trpml members are distantly related and classified as the group  <dig> trps  <cit> . trp genes are almost ubiquitously expressed and occur in splice variants  <cit> . the channel proteins interact with a variety of other proteins to form macromolecular complexes  <cit> . the selectivity for specific cations is diverse among trp channels. some of them are selective for ca2+, some for na+ or mg2+, while others seem to be non-selective cation channels. the known functions of trp channels are extremely diverse as well. some of them mediate sensory transduction of cold, heat, mechanical, osmotic or noxious stimuli  <cit> . others are involved in the regulation of neuronal function, vascular tone  <cit> , epithelial calcium absorption and the regulation of cellular calcium and magnesium homeostasis  <cit> . the variety of isoforms and splice variants and the fact that one cell type often expresses several types of trp proteins makes it difficult to elucidate the precise function of trp channels in individual cells types and tissues. in some cases, one channel isoform is dominant in a specified cell type, i.e. it can be detected in relatively high levels by rt-pcr, in situ hybridization and immunochemical methods. in these rare cases trp channel expression can be correlated with physiological function such as inward currents of cations and the modulation of cellular excitability or calcium homeostasis.

as the majority of trp channels allows an influx of calcium into the cell and since calcium is the most common cellular second messenger, trp channel function may have important consequences for cell growth and division, differentiation and also for cell damage and cell death  <cit> .

to study the roles of trp channels in cells and tissues, it is important to know where they are expressed and at what level they are expressed. in order to obtain valid data about the tissue specific expression it can be important and helpful to test gene expression with several independent techniques. unfortunately, the current expression studies in mammals are heterogeneous with regard to species, applied methods, number of included tissues and cell types and number of included trp channels. some authors show the expression of several trpc isoforms in a variety of rat tissues and cell lines  <cit> , some focus on specific tissues as vessels or vascular smooth muscle  <cit>  or human tissue samples of the central nervous system  <cit> . most studies cover only one subfamily of trp channels, e.g. trpc  <cit>  or trpv  <cit> , although in many cell types channels of several families are expressed and certain members of different families may have overlapping physiological functions. at present it is not clear whether trp channels show a characteristic tissue-specific expression that is constant in different mammalian species or mouse strains.

the current study was designed to prepare a basis for investigating the relevance of trp channels in mammalian tissues in health and disease. we determined the expression of  <dig> trp channel genes in the mouse, one of the major model organisms of man. besides the method of rt-pcr, we used the quantitative method of real-time rt-pcr to investigate the relative expression levels of trp channel genes in a broad spectrum of tissues in three mouse strains. this should give information about the relative significance of distinct trp isoforms in a specific tissue and address the question whether redundancy is a characteristic feature of trp channels. before doing functional studies it is important to know whether there is a dominating channel expressed in a certain tissue or cell type. to verify the data obtained with real-time rt-pcr using an independent method, we applied the technique of in situ hybridization. although we focus on nerve and muscle tissue, an almost complete set of data for a wide spectrum of mouse tissues is presented.

RESULTS
detection and quantification of trp channel transcripts in mouse tissues
using standard rt-pcr as well as real-time rt-pcr we detected signals for all above mentioned trp channel transcripts in many murine tissues. we observed characteristic expression patterns and differences in gene expression of individual trp channels ranging over three orders of magnitude.

standard rt-pcr of trp channel transcripts from peripheral tissues and brain regions from balb/c mice as well as from the mouse skeletal muscle cell line c2c <dig> yielded pcr products of expected size. all products were sequenced in an exemplary manner and revealed the expected dna sequence. figure  <dig> shows the results for some frequently observed trp channels, trpc <dig>  trpc <dig>  trpv <dig>  trpv <dig>  trpm <dig>  trpm <dig> and gapdh, respectively. all tested tissues were positive for trpv <dig> mrna coding for a cation channel sensitive to extracellular osmolarity. the strongest response was observed with kidney . the occurrence of trpm <dig> mrna showed the largest variation among the tested tissues and, in contrast to all other transcripts a low expression in brain regions . the tested brain regions were consistently positive for trpc <dig> and  <dig> as well as for trpv <dig> and  <dig> mrnas. brain regions showed the overall strongest expression of trp channel transcripts and at the same time the highest diversity of trp channel gene expression. muscle tissues, aorta , heart  uterus  and skeletal muscle  were positive for few trp mrnas, in particular trpc <dig> and trpv <dig>  but the signals were relatively weak.

in order to quantify tissue specific trp channel expression more precisely we applied taqman rt-pcr on tissue samples from adult c57bl/ <dig> mice. for the murine transcripts of trpc <dig> and  <dig>  trpv <dig> and  <dig> as well as for trpm2- <dig> and trpm <dig> specific taqman primers and probe sets were developed. they were used to prepare dna standards and to perform real-time rt-pcr. for all other transcripts coding for trp channels commercially available primers and probe sets were used. the primer pairs were chosen in order to obtain products that cross intron-exon borders to exclude results from a contamination with genomic dna. parallel to the analyses of trp channel transcripts, the copy number of eukaroytic 18s rrna was determined for each individual sample. only minor differences in the expression of this housekeeping gene were observed between the different tissues , suggesting that 18s rrna can be used for normalization.

the strongest expression of trpc channels was found in brain areas. in cerebrum trpc <dig> and trpc <dig> dominated followed by trpc <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  trpc <dig> and  <dig> only occurred in low concentrations reaching 2% of that of trpc <dig> . trpc <dig> mrna showed a rather constant level in all tested brain areas while other isoforms varied considerably. trpc <dig> mrna was very prominent in cerebrum and basal ganglia but much less expressed in cerebellum. in the hippocampus trpc <dig> was the most abundant isoform among the trpcs. trpc channel transcripts were also prevalent in peripheral tissues. in the muscle tissues, skeletal muscle, aorta and heart, the trpc <dig> transcript dominated over all other members of the trpc subfamily . the next most frequent isoforms were trpc <dig> and trpc <dig> reaching about 10% of the level of trpc <dig> in heart and diaphragm .

members of the trpv subfamily of cation channels are known for their functions in sensation of heat, cold and other stimuli  and for ca2+ transport through the epithelia . in this study trpv <dig> mrna was hardly detectable in any of the tested tissues and only found at significant levels in basal ganglia and testis. trpv <dig> was the dominating isoform in all tested brain areas. among the trpvs only trpv <dig> reached similar levels. however, compared to the trpc transcripts, trpv <dig> and  <dig> mrnas were expressed at much lower levels reaching only 3â€“10% of those of trpc <dig> and trpc <dig> . as expected, strong signals were found for trpv <dig> in kidney and trpv <dig> in lung. in addition trpv <dig> transcripts were found at high levels in these two organs. altogether in lung and kidney transcripts coding for trpv channels dominated over those of trpcs. in muscle tissues transcripts of trpv <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were regularly detected. while trpv <dig> showed quite a strong expression in tibial and gastrocnemius muscle, trpv <dig> and trpv <dig> were the most abundant isoforms in diaphragm and aorta. in heart muscle the expression the trpvs was very low .

channels of the trpm subfamily serve different functions as they are involved in cold sensation , mg2+ transport  and can have an enzymatic function in addition to their channel activity . in the mouse, the trpm <dig> gene was consistently expressed in all tested organs and tissues and it was at the same time it was the dominating isoform except for brain areas. in brain trpm <dig> mrna was found at highest levels and trpm <dig> transcripts were also found at considerable levels reaching about 10% of those of trpm <dig> and  <dig> . in muscle tissues trpm <dig> dominated, followed by trpm <dig> and  <dig>  the highest expression and diversity among trpms was observed in the aorta, while heart muscle showed the overall lowest expression .

the trpa <dig> transcript coding for a channel possibly involved in cold and chemosensation was found in low levels in various brain regions as well as in reproductive organs and spleen .

taken together, brain areas showed a high diversity and strong expression of trp channels. most prominent were trpm <dig> and m <dig> and trpc <dig> and c <dig>  but many other isoforms are potentially relevant as their transcripts occurred at significant levels. kidney revealed a more restricted and characteristic pattern of trp channels dominated by trpm <dig>  trpv <dig> and v <dig>  followed by trpc <dig> and c <dig>  muscle tissues showed much lower expression, at least one order of magnitude lower than brain and kidney. there seem to be differences in trp channel expression between smooth muscle , skeletal muscles and heart but it is difficult to recognize a typical tissue-specific pattern that is characteristic and differentiates the three muscle tissues.

cellular localization of trpc <dig>  trpc <dig> and trpc <dig> mrnas
the in situ hybridization technique was used to localize mrnas of trpc <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in certain cell types of the cns and peripheral organs. furthermore, the technique was used to visualize mrna levels in these tissues. the experiments were performed with tissue slices of c57bl/ <dig> mice. for trpc <dig>  c <dig> and trpc <dig> positive reactions were observed in the cytoplasm of neuronal cells in the c <dig> area of the hippocampus without any strong variation of expression levels . sense probes applied as controls did not show positive results . in kidney, epithelial cells of the distal tubule showed intense staining of trpc <dig> mrna, while glomeruli and proximal tubules were negative. distal tubules were also positive for trpc <dig> and  <dig> but the staining intensity was much weaker . in lung tissue an intense staining was observed in bronchial epithelium for trpc <dig> and c <dig> while trpc <dig> detection was only slightly positive in these cells. for all three transcripts, pneumocytes showed a lesser reaction than bronchial epithelium, and even poorer staining was observed for blood vessels . epididymis revealed strong expression of trpc <dig> in the epithelium of the ductuli epididymis and ductuli efferentes testes while the other cell types were negative. the same result was obtained for trpc <dig> and  <dig> in these cells . cross sections of skeletal muscle showed most intense sarcolemmal staining for trpc <dig> and less for trpc <dig>  the mrna of trpc <dig> was not detectable in these tissue slices . the results of in situ hybridization as well as staining intensities for many tissues and cell types are summarized in table  <dig> 

differences in trp channel expression between mouse strains
in order to address the question of whether the findings on trp channel gene expression can be generalized for the mouse, in addition to c57bl/ <dig> mice tissue we analyzed samples from animals of two other mouse strains, nod and balb/c. for most of the trp channel transcripts and tissues similar levels were obtained for nod and balb/c mice compared to the c57bl/ <dig> strain . however, some differences between the mouse strains became obvious. to ensure that possible polymorphisms in the primer or probe binding sites would not influence the amplification of the pcr products, we determined the amplification efficiencies for all transcripts and mouse strains shown in fig.  <dig>  for individual genes, pcr efficiencies varied only by several percent between the strains, indicating that they cannot account for the strain specific differences in gene expression. on this basis, trpc <dig> expression was higher in some tissues, e.g. in cerebrum, skeletal muscle and heart of c57bl/ <dig> mice while trpc <dig> expression was lower in the same tissues . data of nod and balb/c mice showed a high degree of congruence. in contrast to c57bl/ <dig>  nod and balb/c mice showed a significant expression of trpv <dig> and v <dig> in the heart and skeletal muscle. the very high expression of trpm <dig> and m <dig> in cerebrum of c57bl/ <dig> mice was not observed in nod and balb/c. furthermore, trpm <dig> expression was very low in tissues of nod mice compared to the c57bl/ <dig> and balb/c strain .

discussion
the trp superfamily of ion channels is a structurally defined group of cation channels showing an enormous functional diversity  <cit> . although several studies have shown the distribution and tissue specific expression of these channels in mammals, the relative importance of individual channels for certain tissues or cell types is widely unknown in most cases. the present study systematically quantifies the expression of all members of the trpc, trpv, trpm and trpa subfamilies in a broad spectrum of tissues.

our results suggest a high relevance of trpm channels in many murine tissues, since members of this subfamily showed the highest expression levels. these findings may qualify some studies that focused on members of the trpc subfamily and tried to correlate gene expression with physiological function. among the trpms, the chanzyme trpm <dig> dominated over all other tested trp members and seems to be ubiquitously expressed. as trpm <dig> has a unique function for cellular mg2+ homeostasis  <cit>  its wide distribution in all tested tissues looks plausible. in most brain areas the copy number of trpm <dig> mrna exceeded even that of trpm <dig>  in contrast to humans where trpm <dig> shows a high expression in kidney  <cit> , mouse kidney did not reveal extensive expression of trpm <dig>  this is in agreement with the results of grimm and coworkers  <cit> , who studied the tissue distribution of trpm <dig> using northern blot analysis and immunochemical methods. obviously, the osmotically regulated channel trpm <dig> has different physiological relevance in different species.

members of the trpc subfamily were also widely distributed in murine tissues, but their overall expression was about one order of magnitude lower than that of the trpms. the dominant and most widely distributed isoform is trpc <dig>  which occurred in high concentrations in all tested brain areas. in addition, trpc <dig> expression was obviously present in many other tissues such as liver, lung, kidney, ovary and testis. this is largely in agreement with results from rat tissues  <cit> , only the absence of trpc <dig> from rat liver showed a marked difference to our results. further, we did not observe the strong expression of trpc <dig> shown by garcia and schilling  <cit> . in many parts of human brain trpc <dig> showed an at least tenfold higher expression than in peripheral tissues  <cit> , a finding that is supported by this study in the mouse. riccio and coworkers  <cit>  also showed a high prevalence of trpc <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> in the cns, i.e. a much stronger expression in all brain regions than in peripheral tissues. only trpc <dig> expression was in the same range in cns as in peripheral tissues. our study comes to similar results for the mouse. furthermore, as levels of trp channel mrnas are normalized to that of 18s rrna , it is possible to estimate the relative importance of an individual trp member for a certain tissue or brain region. for the cellular localization of trp mrnas in the cns we used the in situ hybridization technique. in agreement with two previous publications  <cit>  we detected trpc <dig> mrna and trpc <dig> mrna preferentially in purkinje cells, neurons of basal ganglia and ventricle ependym, while trpc <dig> mrna was only found in a very small amount in any of these cell types. the morphometric results of the mrna levels for trpc <dig>  c <dig> and trpc <dig> displayed a good correlation between real-time rt-pcr and in situ hybridization experiments.

members of the trpv subfamily showed an overall lower expression compared to members of trpc and trpm subfamilies. this is not surprising, since several of these channels serve as molecular sensors for pain and heat sensation and occur preferentially in sensory nerve terminals  <cit> . however, some characteristic exceptions have to be mentioned. high expressions of trpv <dig> and trpv <dig> were observed in kidney . this finding is in agreement with earlier studies showing the importance of trpv <dig> for calcium re-absorption in the kidney  <cit> .

trpa <dig> expression was even lower than that of trpvs and more or less restricted to nervous tissue, ovary, testis and spleen. low expression of trpa <dig> in brain is compatible with its presumed function as a neuronal sensor molecule. its occurrence in reproductive organs is described for the first time in this study.

tissues or organs that mainly consist of muscle cells such as the aorta, skeletal muscle and heart showed an overall low expression of trp channels. however, calcium conducting trp channels may also be of great importance for muscle function, since contraction is controlled by calcium ions. the modulation of muscular calcium signaling by increased calcium entry through the sarcolemma can have consequences for muscle function and may cause dysfunction and disease  <cit> . for members of the trpc subfamily the expression in smooth muscle and tissue preparations such as the aorta have been well investigated. signals of trpc <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> have been reported in mouse and rat aorta, while trpc <dig> and c <dig> transcripts were not observed  <cit> . our study confirms many of these results. in addition, we observed the presence of trpc <dig> in the aorta, but very low signals for trpc <dig> and c <dig>  furthermore, other members of the trp family may be of relevance for aortic smooth muscle. we found trpv <dig> expression almost as high as that of the most abundant trpc member, trpc <dig>  trpc <dig> and trpv <dig> expression was even exceeded by trpm <dig> and trpm <dig> .

in human heart muscle several trpc transcripts have been detected. trpc <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> mrnas show moderate levels compared to cns  <cit> . this study comes to the result that among trpc family members only trpc <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> occur in mouse heart at significant levels. we found only traces of trpc <dig> and c <dig> mrnas. differences between mouse and human heart or the fact that trpc <dig> and c <dig> are not constitutively expressed may be responsible for these findings. recently, the upregulation of trpc <dig> and c <dig> was shown in cardiomyocytes in response to inhibition of serca expression. in this model trpc <dig> and c <dig> seem to be induced after insufficient function of sr calcium accumulation  <cit> . using in situ hybridization experiments we were able to localize the mrnas for trpc <dig> and trpc <dig> in cardiac muscle cells but not in the endothelium of cardiac blood vessels. it is known that the subgroup of trpc3/c6/c <dig> can assemble into homo- and heterotetramers  <cit> . as trpc <dig> and c <dig> are expressed at significant levels in mouse heart, these two channels have the potential to form several ca2+ conducting non selective cation channels in myocytes and contribute to cardiac ca2+ homeostasis.

surprisingly, cardiac expression levels of trp mrnas showed considerable variability among different mouse strains. in c57bl mice trpc <dig> was dominantly expressed in heart muscle whereas trpc <dig> was the major isoform in nod and balb/c hearts. heterogeneity was also observed for trpv <dig> expression. this mrna was only found in nod and balb/c hearts and almost absent in the c57bl strain. recently, the presence of trpv <dig> in the sarcolemma of cardiac muscle has been reported. further, the cardiac-specific overexpression of trpv <dig> caused a cardiomyopathy due to cellular ca2+ overload in a transgenic mouse model. the severity of the cardiomyopathy was roughly related to sarcolemmal trpv <dig> levels  <cit> . these data show that trpv <dig> can be an important element of cardiac ca2+ homeostasis. besides trpcs and trpv <dig>  other members of the trp family were found to be expressed in heart muscle, e.g. trpv <dig>  v <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig>  this is in accordance with previous studies showing the expression of trpv <dig>  <cit> , trpv <dig>  <cit> and trpm <dig>  <cit>  in murine heart.

in addition to earlier studies that focussed on the trpc subfamily  <cit> , we investigated expression levels of trpv and trpm channels in skeletal muscle. two reports described the presence of trpc <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> mrnas by standard rt-pcr and showed that the corresponding channel proteins are localized in the sarcolemma  <cit> . these data are in agreement with our results, however we suggest a dominant role of trpc <dig> in mouse muscle, since the trpc <dig> transcript occurs in much higher concentrations than those of the other trpc members. in addition, mrnas of trpv <dig>  v <dig> and v <dig> as well as trpm <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> were found in considerable concentrations in several mouse skeletal muscles including diaphragm.

apart from rt-pcr studies, databases containing expressed sequence tags  can be used to estimate gene expression. the relation of the ests of a certain gene to the total number of ests derived from a tissue provides a measure for gene expression  <cit> . however, trp transcripts code for membrane proteins of low abundance and constitute only a small fraction of the cellular transcriptome. therefore it is not surprising that ests derived from trp rnas occur at very low frequencies. est databases are not very informative for tissues such as skeletal muscle and heart, since the number of hits for individual trp transcripts is often  <dig> or  <dig>  large numbers of ests exist for certain brain regions. in combination with the fact of a rather high trp channel expression in nervous tissue est frequencies may reflect gene expression and can be compared to rt-pcr data. for cerebrum and cerebellum our rt-pcr data  widely agree qualitatively with the occurrence of est frequencies included in unigene. both sets of data show high expression most trpc members, trpm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  followed by trpv <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  however, current est data show quantitative differences to the rt-pcr data and reveal some unexpected negative results. for example, in unigene there is no hit for trpc <dig> in cerebrum and cerebellum is negative for trpv <dig> and  <dig>  thus, to date rt-pcr seems to be the superior method for studying gene expression of low abundance transcripts such as trp channel mrnas.

CONCLUSIONS
we have characterized the tissue specific mrna expression of  <dig> trp ion channels of four major subfamilies. we conclude that transcripts coding for members of the trpc, trpv, trpm and trpa subfamilies are present in a broad spectrum of murine tissues. in addition to well studied tissues we detected many trp isoforms in poorly investigated tissues such as skeletal muscle, heart and reproductive organs. expression levels of members of the trpm subfamily were generally higher than those of trpc and trpv subfamilies indicating important physiological roles of trpms. for some trpc members the data obtained by quantitative rt-pcr were largely confirmed by in situ hybridization. in view of the mouse as the major model organism of man, differences between trp channel expression in human and murine tissues are of major interest. this study offers a guideline for the investigation of the physiological relevance of individual members of almost the whole trp channel superfamily.
