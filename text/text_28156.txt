BACKGROUND
g-protein-coupled receptors  are the largest superfamily of signalling molecules in the human genome with approximately  <dig> genes, each containing a seven-helix transmembrane domain   <cit> . gpcrs are distributed throughout the body in cellular membranes and act as conduits, binding extracellular ligands  or capturing light photons , converting the energy they embody into intracellular responses by stabilizing certain receptor conformational states, in turn influencing intracellular binding of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins  or β-arrestin  <cit> . as gpcrs are highly abundant in the human body and involved in many diverse signalling pathways , as well as typically binding small ligands, they serve as excellent drug targets  <cit> . gpcrs are currently targeted by ~40% of today’s marketed drugs and it is likely that their potential “druggability” is even greater  <cit> . indeed, of the  <dig> non-olfactory gpcrs,  <dig> have already been drugged with small molecules  <cit> .

despite their known importance as drugs targets and role in human disease  <cit> , the mechanisms that precisely control gpcr ligand binding and receptor activation have until very recently been hindered by a lack of structural knowledge, in particular due to a relative lack of crystallized active receptor states and receptor-ligand complexes. gpcrs are grouped into distinct classes with class a  being the largest and containing the greatest number of crystallized structures, mostly in their inactive state. however, significant advances in crystallization has recently permitted the structural determination of several class a receptors in active  states, i.e. β2-adrenergic  <cit> , adenosine a2a  <cit> , metarhodopsin ii  <cit> , neurotension nts <dig>  <cit> , acetyl choline muscarinic m <dig>  <cit> , and p2y <dig>  <cit>  receptors. these active structures have significantly added diversity and detail to gpcr structural knowledge, which before them was primarily limited to the inactive structures of rhodopsin , antagonist-bound β2/1-adrenergic  and adenosine a2a receptors . furthermore, in addition to the recent emergence of several active structures, several more class a receptors have been crystallized in their inactive antagonist-bound state, e.g. mu-  <cit> , kappa-  <cit> , delta-  <cit> , n/ofq-  <cit>  opioid receptors, muscarinic m <dig> receptor  <cit> , chemokine receptors cxcr <dig>  <cit>  and ccr <dig>  <cit> , and protease-activated receptor  <dig>   <cit> . as a consequence, several studies have taken advantage of these recent developments in crystallization and attempted to identify various activation mechanisms in class a gpcrs, primarily through visual comparison of specific receptor structures in inactive and active states  <cit> . some studies have also identified specific “micro-switches”, i.e. small groups of residues that undergo conformational change during receptor activation  <cit> . molecular dynamics has been used to investigate pathways of activation in class a receptors, such as β2-adrenergic  <cit> ), adenosine a2a  <cit> , muscarinic acetylcholine m <dig>  <cit> , s1p <dig>  <cit>  and rhodopsin  <cit> . several intrahelical features have also been identified as important in gpcr structure and function, such as kinks or α-bulges, often near prolines in highly conserved positions  <cit> , and sulphur-containing residues acting as molecular gears  <cit> . biased signalling, i.e. different ligands selecting for different intracellular binding partners, is another area that is gaining particular attention  <cit> , such as β2-adrenergic receptor adopting different conformations of tm <dig> for selective gi or gs binding  <cit> , enhancement of β-arrestin over g-protein binding with δ-opioid receptor through disruption of interhelical interfaces  <cit>  and serotonin 2a receptor where hallucinogenic and non-hallucinogenic agonists respectively stabilize different conformations of an intracellular loop region implicated in partner binding  <cit> .

however, although informative in their own way, none of these studies have quantitatively assessed gpcr conformational change at an overall level between active and inactive states, nor utilised the extra number of receptor structures that have recently become available to provide increased statistical power. furthermore, in our opinion, an explanation of how the common functional mechanisms that appear to be at work in gpcr activation  are mediated through agonist  binding has not yet been convincingly made. such an understanding would greatly aid the design of new or more selective/biased agonists or antagonists to target therapeutically important gpcrs, as well as explaining the effect that naturally occurring mutations have on constitutive receptor activity and disease, or indeed predicting where mutations could be inserted to intentionally modulate receptor activity. we believe the opportunity for such analyses has become possible due to the recent surge of new crystal structures in varying states of activation. here, we present a quantifying analysis of gpcr conformational change with statistical comparison, using a set of  <dig> class a structures:  <dig> active and  <dig> inactive and two algorithms: helix packing pair  <cit>  and povme  <cit> . our intention is to quantify existing theories of class a gpcr activation, as well as potentially discovering new ones, and in doing so help to form a better understanding of the common features governing receptor activation. however, we do not attempt to replicate specific analyses of previous studies that focus on highly detailed aspects of particular receptors or nuanced differences. instead we focus on overall conformational changes between tm helices, which can be identified as being in common across the whole class a receptor family, as far as is currently possible with the structures available. we also seek to identify the most important aspects of conformational change according to statistical significance so that these can potentially be correlated with agonist or antagonist binding patterns. regarding the algorithms we chose to employ, helix packing pair mathematically measures the dihedral angle between packed helix pairs  as well as measuring the extent of atomic interaction and distances between helices  <cit> , thereby detecting rotational and translational movements of each helix and their changing interactions. povme measures binding pocket volume and shape and permits a mathematical comparison between different gpcr conformational binding-site volumes. as a result, by combining the various data, an internal geometrical picture of each gpcr can be made, which can then be compared to different conformations of a particular receptor or across different receptors  or used to calculate average features across all known gpcr states. here we specifically compare the geometrical features of active class a gpcr structures with respect to inactive structures, both in terms of individual receptors and across the family as a whole, and as a result identify the most statistically significant and common conformational changes involved. furthermore, with respect to five specific class a receptors whose inactive and active states are both known, including the recently released p2y purinoceptor  <dig>  <cit>  and  <cit> , we compare protein-agonist and protein-antagonist interactions and possibly identify a common means of agonist-mediated action that likely stabilizes the active state.figure  <dig> the interhelical dihedral angle: degree of rotation between planes of two interacting helices defined by axis vectors and perpendicular vector of closest approach. helix pair interaction is assessed by number of interhelical van der waals contacts and h-bonds.



RESULTS
in order to quantify conformational changes in  <dig> class a gpcr crystal structures,  <dig> in the inactive state and  <dig> in the active state, an analysis was made with helix packing pair  <cit>  to determine the orientation of helix pairs in each 7tm domain and how these differ between receptor states. three conformational features were assessed:  helix tilt by measuring degree of rotation between contacting helices, i.e. their interhelical angle from 0-90°   <cit> ,  helix translation by measuring interhelical distances between centrally positioned and highly conserved residues in the core of each receptor ,  interhelical interaction by counting the number of van der waals’ , hydrogen bonds and electrostatic contacts between helices. in total, in each receptor twelve helix pairs are commonly observed with tm <dig> participating in five pairs, tm <dig> and tm <dig> participating in four each, tm <dig>  tm <dig> and tm <dig> in three each, and tm <dig> in two . in this context, tm <dig> can be considered the central “hub” helix in the 7tm fold, making the most interhelical packing contacts. the interhelical angles, interhelical distances and interhelical contacts in twelve helix pairs were compared across all receptor structures with the average values for active and inactive receptor states shown in figure  <dig> , figure  <dig> , figures  <dig> and  <dig> . in addition, the differences between these states and hence overall conformational changes are shown proportionally in figure  <dig>  overall the average interhelical angles involving tm <dig> remain mostly static across inactive and active states as its tilt and that of its interacting partners remain relatively constant. an exception to this rule is the tm3-tm <dig> angle, which undergoes a significant adjustment as the intracellular end of tm <dig> tilts outwards during receptor activation, becoming more parallel with respect to tm <dig> . however, tm <dig> undergoes a significant translational movement upwards and towards tm <dig>  reducing the distance between residues l/i/v/t <dig>  and d <dig>  . the upward axial movement of tm <dig> has been proposed before as a component of receptor activation  <cit>  but the sideways movement towards tm <dig> also appears to be an important feature, contributing to a more compact 7tm fold. as well as the interhelical angles involving tm <dig>  the angles involving tm <dig>  tm <dig> and tm <dig> remain mostly constant between active and inactive states, suggesting a degree of rigidity in this side of the receptor. however, noticeably greater differences are observed between active and inactive states with respect to tm <dig>  tm <dig> and tm <dig>  as already mentioned, the outward tilting of tm <dig> at the intracellular side seen in g-protein-bound activated receptors  <cit>   also creates key changes in interhelical angles: tm5-tm <dig> and tm6-tm <dig>  the angle between tm <dig> and tm <dig> decreases as these helices become more parallel  while the angle between tm <dig> and tm <dig> increases as these helices become less parallel . these angle differences also reflect a movement in the helices partnering tm <dig>  i.e. tm <dig> undergoes a minor tilt outwards at its intracellular side and tm <dig> tilts inwards at its intracellular side in the reverse direction to tm <dig>  the tilting of tm <dig> also causes a minor reduction in the tm1-tm <dig> angle as these two helices become more parallel . there is also a significant inward translational movement of tm <dig> towards tm <dig> , as well as a statistically significant increase in the number of vdws between these two helices in active receptor states . conformational change in tm <dig> can perhaps be considered the most defining features of gpcr activation as it is statistically significant across all three conformational categories and is seemingly independent of g-protein binding .figure  <dig> helix pairs in class a gpcrs.  extracellular view of 7tm fold of the muscarinic acetylcholine m <dig> receptor .  2d representation of average conformational changes during receptor activation . helices are solid black circles. helix pairs connected with black dotted lines. line width is proportional to change in interhelical angle. circular arrows give angle rotation direction: anticlockwise for angle decrease , clockwise for angle increase . solid black arrows show translational movement of helices.



in general terms, the number of vdws between packed helices is greater in active states relative to inactive states , suggesting a more compact fold in activated receptors. with regards to h-bonds the picture is more balanced with both losses and gains occurring across all helix pairs, although a loss of interaction between helices tm <dig> and tm <dig> is noticeable although not statistically significant . this observation partly reflects the loss of the “ionic lock” that occurs in some receptors during activation as tm <dig> tilts outwards on the intracellular side away from tm <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, the distance between tm <dig> and tm <dig> at their midpoints does not change between active and inactive states, suggesting that tilting of tm <dig> around its centre point is responsible for conformational change between tm <dig> and tm <dig> in g-protein-bound receptor structures  rather than a translational movement. an increase in the number of h-bonds between tm <dig> and tm <dig> is also noticeable in active structures and is close to statistical significance  as is a translational movement of tm <dig> towards tm <dig> . these features are indicative of a stronger interaction between tm <dig> and tm <dig>  which has previously been described in b2ar and m2r activation  <cit> . in general terms, it is striking how the distances between helix pairs at their centre points  do not change much apart from the three examples mentioned: tm3-tm <dig>  tm2-tm <dig> and tm5-tm <dig>  instead it appears that helix tilting is the primary means of imparting conformational change in class a gpcrs, with changes in interhelical angles mainly involving tm <dig>  tm <dig> and tm <dig> 

in order to inspect conformational changes in more detail, interhelical angles and their effect on receptor conformation were assessed in the inactive and active states of five receptors: β2-adrenergic receptor , adenosine a2a receptor , muscarinic acetylcholine m <dig> receptor , rhodopsin , and p2y purinoceptor  <dig>  . these five receptors are the only gpcrs that have been crystallized in both active and inactive states, although a2ar and p2y12r are only “semi-active” as they contain no bound g-protein or stabilizing nanobody. the interhelical angle changes observed in these five receptors reflect the averages as one might expect, although to differing degrees. the greatest conformational change is seen in the fully activated receptors with bound g-protein e.g. b2ar and m2r, and to a lesser extent rho, which has a bound intracellular fragment. some conformational change is also apparent in “semi-active” a2ar and p2y12r, although it is more subtle. taking each helix pair at a time, the greatest change between tm <dig> and tm <dig> occurs in m2r, where a shift of -22° is observed during activation . the smallest change in the tm5-tm <dig> angle is observed in a2ar, where a shift of -4° is explained by a relative lack of movement in tm <dig> as a result of no bound g-protein . likewise, the greatest change in the tm3-tm <dig> angle occurs in m2r, with a shift of -20°, while the smallest change is seen in rho with -4°. with regards to the tm6-tm <dig> angle, four receptors show a significant change upon agonist-induced activation, while in p2y12r the change is more moderate. the greatest is observed in b2ar where tm6-tm <dig> shifts by +21°  and is the lowest in p2y12r with a shift of +4° , a result of no bound g-protein and little intracellular movement of tm <dig>  however, more unusually, inward bending of tm <dig> towards the orthosteric binding pocket on the extracellular side contributes to a change in the tm6-tm <dig> angle in p2y12r. this demonstrates that although a common rotational change between tm <dig> and tm <dig> occurs in activated receptors, this conformational movement can be delivered in different ways, either through a relative tilting of tm <dig> with respect to tm <dig> or vice versa, or indeed a combination of both in the larger conformational change seen in fully activated receptors, e.g. b2ar and m2r. likewise, despite no bound g-protein, a significant change in the tm6-tm <dig> angle is observed in the “semi-active” state of a2ar with a shift of +13°  due to an inward tilting of tm <dig> on the intracellular side. in particular, this suggests that an intracellular movement of tm <dig> is a pre-requisite step for full activation, which is followed by intracellular movement of tm <dig> and g-protein binding. all five receptors show an increased level of interaction between tm <dig> and tm <dig>  in agreement with average observations, with the greatest change seen in b2ar and m2r, reflecting their fully active status . likewise, the interhelical tm3-tm <dig> distance decreases in all receptors with the greatest change seen in a2ar, where residue s <dig>  undergoes a shift towards i <dig>  by  <dig>  Å . however, in other receptors a shift of  <dig> - <dig>  Å is more common.figure  <dig> the difference between interhelical angles in inactive and active states of class a gpcrs:  β2-adrenergic receptor,  rhodopsin,  adenosine a2a receptor,  muscarinic acetylcholine m <dig> receptor,  p2y purinoceptor  <dig> 



in view of the observed movements of tm <dig> in relation to tm <dig> and tm <dig>  the interaction of tm <dig> and tm <dig> with co-crystallized agonists and antagonists was compared in five receptors . rho is different from the others as its ligand  is covalently bound to tm <dig> and undergoes a conformational switch upon photo-activation, contributing to a different orientation of tm <dig> . the four other receptors bind diffusible agonists/antagonists and changes in the orientation of tm <dig> are observed between inactive and active states in all . in the active state of a2ar, where tm <dig> makes an intracellular inward tilt with respect to tm <dig> , the agonist uk- <dig> makes three h-bonds with tm <dig>  whilst in the inactive state, the antagonist zm <dig> makes none . in addition, the agonist also makes an extra h-bond with tm <dig>  in the active and inactive states of b2ar, the agonist  and antagonist  both make two h-bonds with tm <dig>  however unlike the antagonist, the agonist makes an h-bond with tm <dig> . this may contribute extra stability to the different orientation between tm <dig> and tm <dig> . furthermore, the agonist in b2ar is shorter in length than its respective antagonist, requiring a translation of tm <dig> to maintain the h-bonding pattern. in the active state of p2y12r, an inward movement of tm <dig> is concomitant with the agonist  making an h-bond with tm <dig>  while an extracellular inward movement of tm <dig> accommodates three h-bonds between agonist and tm <dig> . these interactions are absent in the inactive state of p2y12r, where the antagonist  makes only a single h-bond with tm <dig> . finally, m2r is different from the other receptors as the crystal structure of the active state contains an allosteric modulator  as well as an agonist  . both the antagonist  and iperoxo make a classical h-bond with tm <dig>  while the latter also forms a close ch--o interaction with y <dig>  . furthermore, ly <dig> makes two h-bonds with tm <dig> and tm <dig>  respectively . these additional allosteric interactions may stabilise the observed change in the tm6-tm <dig> angle . therefore, taken together, the observed pattern of h-bonding interactions in these five receptors suggests agonist interactions with tm <dig> and tm <dig> encourage a shift in the tm6-tm <dig> interhelical angle, while h-bonds with tm <dig> additionally encourage a reduction in the tm3-tm <dig> distance, both seemingly common features of receptor activation, likely constituting the principal mechanism of agonist action.figure  <dig> a comparison of antagonists  in inactive states  and agonists  in active states  of class a gpcrs:  rhodopsin,  adenosine a2a,  β2-adrenergic,  muscarinic acetylcholine m <dig>   p2y purinoceptor  <dig>  only side-chains on tm <dig> and tm <dig> that make covalent or h-bonds with antagonists/agonists are displayed. h-bonds shown as black lines, calculated with chimera  <cit> . agonists typically make more h-bonds with tm6/ <dig> than respective antagonists.



in order to investigate the effect changes in the tm3-tm <dig>  tm5-tm <dig> and tm6-tm <dig> interhelical angles, as well as tm3-tm <dig> distance, have on the orthosteric binding-site, pocket volume in five receptors: b2ar, a2ar, m2r, rho, and p2y12r was calculated with povme  <cit>  in inactive and active states, respectively. this reveals a common conformational event that occurs during activation in terms of both pocket shape and volume . regarding shape, the binding-site in each receptor narrows as a result of the inward transition of tm <dig>  also in four of five receptors, pocket volume significantly decreases during activation by an average of - <dig> Å3 ±  <dig> s.e.m. , a consequence of angle changes involving tm <dig>  tm <dig> and tm <dig> and translation of tm <dig> and tm <dig>  the one exception to this rule is rhodopsin whose pocket volume remains constant despite undergoing conformational narrowing . rhodopsin may be a special case as unlike the other receptors it does not bind a diffusible ligand and has an internalized extracellular loop  <dig>  which traverses inside its 7tm domain. as a result, rhodopsin has the smallest pocket compared to other receptors . this unusual feature likely restricts rhodopsin from making more extensive conformational changes upon receptor activation and without needing to bind its ligand, perhaps removes the need for it to do so. the significant conformational shift of tm <dig> is seemingly mediated by increased interactions with agonists, which results in an increase in the tm6-tm <dig> angle, reduction in tm3-tm <dig> distance and a narrower pocket. the extent of pocket shrinkage during activation varies between receptors, observed at its greatest in m2r whose pocket decreases by -60%, followed by p2y12r whose pocket decreases by -54%, -40% in a2ar and -26% in b2ar . nevertheless despite these differences in magnitude, it appears that the five receptors function in a similar fashion, both in terms of their relative reorientation of tm <dig>  the binding mode of the agonist, and overall effect on binding-pocket shape and volume. these suggest a common functional mechanism.figure  <dig> a comparison of inactive states  and active states  of class a gpcrs :  and : adenosine a2a receptor,  and : rhodopsin,  and : β2-adrenergic receptor, investigate pathways of activation and : muscarinic acetylcholine m <dig> receptor,  and : p2y purinoceptor <dig>  binding-site volumes  were calculated with povme  <cit> .



the intracellular g-protein binding-site of class a gpcrs generally gets less attention than the orthosteric ligand binding-site, although recent studies are addressing this  <cit> . in recognition, we also focussed povme on the intracellular side of the five receptors in order to inspect conformational changes in the g-protein binding-site. as three receptors are co-crystallized with a bound intracellular partner , we expected to see strong intracellular changes and reassuringly we did . in these three receptors, the intracellular g-protein binding-site increases in volume by an average of  <dig> Å3 ±  <dig> s.e.m.  from inactive to active state. this number is interesting as it is approximately twice that of the observed average decrease in the orthosteric binding pocket upon agonist binding. this supports the notion that conformational changes are amplified or “doubled” from extracellular to intracellular sides  <cit> . a2ar and p2y12r, who have no co-crystallized intracellular partner, and despite apparent conformational changes on their extracellular sides, show no statistical volume changes in their intracellular g-protein binding-sites. however despite this, there is clear intracellular conformational change, particularly with respect to a2ar, whose outward tilting of tm <dig> and inward pinching of tm <dig> creates a flatter, wider space . binding of a g-protein would therefore likely stabilize an even greater displacement of tm <dig> and create a larger volume difference. p2y12r also shows some intracellular conformational differences but these are a result of subtle changes in the c-terminal structure of tm <dig> rather than helix tilting, with a partial unravelling of tm <dig> by half a helix-turn also changing the orientation of h <dig>  this has an effect of increasing the space between tm <dig> and tm <dig> and changing the shape of the pocket but not its overall volume . however, in way of caution, both the inactive and active states of p2y12r are crystallised with bril-fusion constructs , meaning intracellular conformational changes may be restricted.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
although comparative studies of gpcrs in active and inactive states have been performed before  <cit> , these have generally been based on visual comparisons of structural superimpositions, which can lead to different interpretations. this is particularly the case when conformational changes in receptors are large or comparison between different receptors is difficult because of alternative structural alignments. here, we implement quantifying methods for gpcr conformational analysis: helix packing pair  <cit>  and povme  <cit>  that operate independently of structural superimposition as each receptor structure is analysed internally, making for easier comparison between active and inactive states. it also allows for a statistical evaluation of the average differences between receptor states.

despite the calculations involving different receptors, as class a gpcrs share many sequence and structural features as well as g-protein binding partners  <cit> , we believe such comparisons are meaningful and can potentially reveal common conformational changes and shared mechanisms of agonist/antagonist action. the results generated with a set of  <dig> class a gpcrs, and subset of five receptors in detail, suggest a common overall set of conformational changes that occur during gpcr activation, and that these are mediated by agonist interaction with tm <dig> and particularly tm <dig>  the statistically significant conformational changes in active states, with respect to inactive, can be summarized as follows:  an inward translation of tm <dig> with respect to tm <dig> and tilting of tm <dig> with respect to tm <dig>  increasing the tm6-tm <dig> angle and increasing the interaction between tm <dig> and tm7;  a lateral and upward translation of tm <dig>  decreasing the distance between tm <dig> and tm3;  stabilized by g-protein binding, an outward tilting of tm <dig> that increases the tm6-tm <dig> angle and decreases the tm3-tm <dig> angle . in an analysis with povme in both active and inactive states, the sum of these conformational changes results in the narrowing of the orthosteric binding-site between tm <dig> and tm6/tm <dig>  significantly decreasing pocket volume. on the intracellular side, significant increases in volume of the g-protein binding-site are observed in activated receptors with bound g-protein or derivatives, which are approximately twice the size in magnitude of changes on the extracellular side. even in receptors with no bound g-protein, some intracellular conformational change is apparent, which may assist g-protein binding. these observed changes suggest common conformational change is apparent in an overall sense of class a gpcrs, which is mirrored by a repeating trend of increased h-bonding by agonists to tm <dig> and tm <dig> with respect to antagonists. indeed, it is tempting to speculate that design of agonists through rational means should include functional h-bonding groups for strong contact with residues at the c-terminus of tm <dig> and the n-terminus of tm <dig>  likewise, antagonists should possibly be designed to preclude h-bonding with the n-terminus of tm <dig> and to a lesser extent with tm <dig> as well, although potentially still h-bonding with the n-terminus of tm <dig>  which may act as an “anchor”.

another interesting aspect of gpcrs is the contribution this family of receptors makes to human disease through naturally occurring mutations that result in loss or gain of constitutive activity. strikingly, of those mutations that are documented in various class a gpcrs, a large proportion are located on tm <dig> and tm <dig>  particularly at their mutual interface, which appears to confirm the functional importance of tm <dig> and tm <dig> conformational change. other mutations are also found on tm <dig> or tm <dig> in their respective interfaces with tm <dig> or tm <dig>  <cit> . some mutations directly affect ligand binding, for example, mutation of k <dig>  or e <dig>   in rhodopsin affects retinal binding and eradicates the salt bridge formed between tm <dig> and tm <dig> that stabilizes the inactive state  <cit> . other residues are found on the intracellular side of tm <dig>  such as d <dig> , which forms the ionic lock between tm <dig> and tm <dig> e.g. in follicle-stimulating hormone receptor , thyrotropin receptor  and n <dig>  in melanocortin  <dig> receptor , whose mutations cause destabilization of the inactive state  <cit> . however, the majority of residues are located midway on helices tm <dig> and tm <dig> at their common interface e.g. m/l <dig>  , t/v <dig>  , c <dig>  , p <dig>  , n <dig> , n <dig> , and l <dig>    <cit> . mutation of any of these residues results in increased constitutive receptor activity by disrupting the packing between tm <dig> and tm <dig> and possibly by interfering with a water-mediated interhelical h-bonding network in inactive receptor states e.g. tshr and rhodopsin  <cit> . it can be further speculated that mutation in this “hotspot” area  would likely affect activity of other class a gpcrs. unfortunately, studying the exact nature of the water-mediated effect between tm <dig> and tm <dig> in a statistical way is not possible as the crystal structure resolution of the majority of receptors is not high enough . however the high-resolution crystal structures of inactive a2ar and inactive delta opioid receptor  <cit>  have recently been determined   <cit>  and show three water molecules bound between n <dig> , n <dig>  and l <dig> , and one water molecule next to p <dig>  . it can be speculated that these water molecules exist in other class a gpcrs stabilising their inactive states, and need to be rearranged for receptor activation when the tm6-tm <dig> interhelical angle changes or when residues in this interface are mutated. indeed, molecular dynamics studies of water molecules in class a gpcrs have recently shown that a continuous central water channel opens up during receptor activation, which is not present in the inactive state  <cit> . this highlights the functional role of dynamic waters in receptor activation although a high-resolution crystal structure of a class a gpcr in its active state is ideally required to confirm this hypothesis. in addition to the tm6-tm <dig> interface, mutations in other interfaces alter the activity of some class a gpcrs. in particular, mutations are often found in the tm3-tm <dig>  tm5-tm <dig> and tm1-tm <dig> interfaces whose respective interhelical angles are seen to follow trends in receptor activation e.g. a <dig>  in the interface with tm <dig>  whose mutation causes a gain in receptor activity and y <dig>   whose mutation causes a loss of activity. similarly located on tm <dig> in the interface with tm <dig> is d <dig>   whose mutation causes a gain in receptor activity  <cit> . conversely, on tm <dig> in the interface with tm <dig> is f <dig>  , whose mutation results in a loss of receptor activity  <cit> . finally, located on tm <dig> and involved in the interface with tm <dig> is c <dig>   whose mutation causes a gain in activity  <cit> . taken together, these mutations point to the functional importance of several interhelical conformational changes, primarily involving interhelical angles tm6-tm <dig> and tm3-tm <dig> but also tm5-tm <dig> and tm1-tm <dig> figure  <dig> tm6-tm <dig> interface of rhodopsin in its inactive state  with residue positions  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  highlighted  . upon mutation these “hotspot” residues increase constitutive activity of some class a gpcrs by destabilising their inactive states. extracellular side of membrane is represented by red dots and the intracellular side by blue dots.



the analysis performed here also potentially offers a new means of classifying gpcr structural states. for instance, in active  receptors, the tm6-tm <dig> angle resides between 15-30°, tm5-tm <dig> between 8-21° and tm3-tm <dig> between 24-35°, while the tm2-tm <dig> and tm3-tm <dig> distances reside between  <dig> - <dig>  Å and  <dig> - <dig>  Å, respectively. on the other hand, in inactive receptors the tm6-tm <dig> angle adopts 0-19°, tm5-tm <dig> between 19-35° and tm3-tm <dig> between 31-46°, while tm2-tm <dig> and tm3-tm <dig> distances reside between  <dig> - <dig>  Å and  <dig> - <dig>  Å, respectively. although these ranges overlap to some degree, as more active gpcr crystal structures become available these features can likely be refined further, as well as the statistical analysis between receptor states made even more robust. however, they currently offer a useful guide for classifying conformational states and extent of activation of gpcr structures through quantifiable means without the need for visual comparison of structural superimpositions.

the recently developed strategy of crystallizing gpcrs in active states with co-crystallized g-proteins/nanobodies has made it possible for quantifying class a gpcr activation with statistical significances. this has been aided by the recent crystallization of agonist-bound receptor structures that can be classified as “semi-active”. these structures show conformational changes on the extracellular side just like fully active structures but less noticeably on the intracellular side. they are particularly interesting as they give a suggestion of the intermediate steps that occur during receptor activation prior to g-protein binding. clearly as more gpcrs are crystallized in their active state, statistical analysis of gpcr activation will become more powerful and potentially reveal more of the mechanistic subtleties involved, as well as identifying other common or differential aspects between receptors. however, it seems apparent that in terms of overall conformation change, class a gpcrs share several features, as well as similar agonist/antagonist binding patterns, which can possibly be used as a starting point for the design of new drugs with predictable action against other class a gpcrs.
