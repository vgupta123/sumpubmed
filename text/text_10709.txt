BACKGROUND
proliferative enteropathy, which is caused by lawsonia intracellularis, is responsible for relevant economic losses in swine production systems due to increased mortality rates, increased drug usage and compromised weight gain  <cit> . porcine proliferative enteropathy  is characterized by enterocyte proliferation and thickening of the intestinal mucosa  <cit> . it can cause either chronic enteritis, manifested by diarrhea and a reduction in growth rate and hemorrhagic enteritis, which is associated with sudden death in finishing pigs  <cit> , or a subclinical presentation in which the pigs show reduced growth but no clinical signs  <cit> .

serology is an efficient method for determining swine exposure to a specific agent when sufficient samples are collected  <cit> . immunoperoxidase monolayer assay  is a serological test with high sensitivity and specificity that can be used to determine the herd serological profile for ppe  <cit> . determining the age group in which the peak seroconversion occurs in the herd makes it possible to estimate the time of infection and recommend the use of antibiotics or vaccination, which allows for the development of an active immune response and avoids economic losses from clinical and subclinical diseases  <cit> .

very few prevalence studies of swine enteric diseases have been conducted in brazil  <cit> . despite the economic impact of ppe  <cit> , risk factor analyses are rare  <cit> .

the purpose of the present study was to determine predominant serological profile to l. intracellularis antibodies in intensive pig production regions of minas gerais and to identify risk factors related to its infection in pigs and the herd-level seropositivity and the seroprevalence.

RESULTS
one hundred serum samples were obtained from  <dig> swine herds; however, one finishing animal sample was lost, resulting in a total of  <dig> samples.

seroprevalence
all sampled herds had at least one positive serum sample for igg against l. intracellularis. no significant differences were found among the seroprevalences of the analyzed regions  . regarding the weighted seroprevalence,  <dig>  %  of the pigs tested positive for anti-l. intracellularis igg.fig.  <dig> serological profile for l. intracellularis antibodies in swine herds from minas gerais state, brazil. the bars indicate the standard error for the prevalence in each category

risk factors associated with l. intracellularis infection
four variables were considered associated to the l. intracellularis herd-level seropositivity  in the primary univariable linear regression  but only “cleaning before disinfection” showed a relationship to seropositivity , with p<  <dig>  in a multicolinear association.table  <dig> linear regression results for risk factors. only the “cleaning before disinfecting” showed a significant association to the l. intracelularis herd level seropositivity

discussion
this is the first anti-l. intracellularis seroprevalence study using ipma in intensive swine herds in minas gerais state, brazil, one of the very few evaluations of seroprofiles of herds and risk factors for seropositivity. none of the included herds in the study were using the l. intracellularis attenuated vaccine. all of the herds had at least one seropositive sample, which demonstrates that l. intracellularis is endemic in the state, with an overall animal seroprevalence of  <dig>  %. the relative low overall seroprevalence can be explained by the two potential seronegative categories, susceptible nursery piglets without seroconversion for l. intracellularis infection and multiparous sows that may previously have had igg but not at the time of sampling, once the igg titers decrease three months post infection  <cit> .

susceptibility to l. intracellularis infection starts in pigs of approximately 6 weeks of age and is followed by seroconversion 2 weeks later  <cit> , which suggests increased igg detection in animals older than 8 weeks. therefore, detectable antibodies in grow/finishing pigs and sows/gilts likely arise from the immunological response due to direct exposition to the bacteria as none of the farms were current using a vaccine immunization protocol against l. intracellularis. these infection dynamics explain the higher seroprevalence for finishing pigs in all four regions. in addition, as nursery piglets younger than 5 weeks may have been sampled, the detected igg antibodies in this phase may correspond to maternal antibodies; therefore, the positive results do not indicate an active immune response. to avoid this type of misinterpretation, only nursery pigs older than 5 weeks should be sampled.

the serological profiles obtained in the present study are consistent with the disease dynamics of infection that were previously observed in herds in which intensive antimicrobial protocols were in place for growing phases, without the restriction of growing promoters  <cit> . a total of 97 % of the sampled herds used antimicrobials as growth promoters and/or to prevent diseases, and all herds had at least one positive sample by ipma, which indicated that drug usage does not prevent infection. in these production systems, usually, the infection tends to occur after the decrease of maternal antibodies , a period that coincides with weaning stress, mixing pig groups , as well as diet changes  <cit> . antimicrobial usage reduces infection pressure in the nursery and, therefore, seroconversion begins in the growing strata, reaching peak levels at finishing phase and declining in sows that are kept in the herd for breeding  <cit> . in european herds, where the administration of antimicrobials as growth promoters is not allowed, seroconversion tends to occur earlier, about six weeks after weaning, corresponding to 70 days of age  <cit> . this probably reflects the nursery piglets susceptibility, in addition to the absence of antibiotics in feed, which make these pigs becoming infected and seroconverted earlier in relation to the herds there were sampled in the present study.

the sample weighting used in this study allowed an increase in the external validity and a better estimate of the prevalence of l. intracellularis infection in minas gerais and allowed comparisons to different sampled regions and pig categories. without sample weighting, there may be a distortion of variance, with either overestimation or underestimation of the results  <cit> . despite its importance, this type of analysis is not commonly used in other studies that compare crude seropositivity findings to either different categories or different country regions .

the only published study regarding l. intracellularis seroprevalence in brazil, which used an indirect fluorescence antibodies method, demonstrated that  <dig>  % of the herds from minas gerais were exposed to the bacteria  <cit> , results very similar to our findings. moreno et al.  <cit>  sampled  <dig> herds in the same state, and 16 % had l. intracellularis dna detected by pcr in fecal samples. viott et al.  <cit>  demonstrated the l. intracellularis presence in minas gerais herds, also using pcr, in co-infections in  <dig>  % of the herds. these differences may be due to the low sensitivity of pcr, the small number of tested herds and samples or because pcr only detect shedders, whereas serology detects antibodies that last longer, suggesting a greater chance of detecting a seropositive animal, and consequently a positive herd  <cit> . regardless of methodological differences, similar to our results, high herd prevalence was found in several countries worldwide, such as canada  <cit> , us  <cit> , australia  <cit> , france, spain  <cit> , china  <cit> , and russia  <cit> . despite the management and animal production law differences in these countries, l. intracellularis has been found in most herds.

of more than  <dig> variables selected from the questionnaire, “cleaning before disinfecting” was indicated as a “protective factor”. properties that adopted this management method reduced the seropositivity approximately 4 %, similar to the findings of corzo et al.   <cit> . the correct management of facilities, with cleaning and disinfection, decreases environmental l. intracellularis maintenance  <cit> , which indicates in a lower infection pressure that prevents the infection to naïve pigs housed in the facilities.

the uniformity of sanitary management procedures among the studied herds may explain the lack of significant differences for both seropositivity and risk factors. this finding indicates that the included farms were homogeneous for management and biosecurity and were positive for l. intracellularis antibodies, the probability of finding a variable to discriminate positive and negative herds decreases as well as the differences in prevalence among regions. other risk factors were previously found, but due the reasons mentioned above, they could not be associated to the infection in the present study. solid and slatted floor in growing and finishing batches  was adopted by 100 % of the properties research at our research. herd size, pointed as a risk factor by bronsvoort et al.   <cit>  could not be statistically associated with the herd positivity, as the  <dig> properties were classified in the same strata  <cit> . the "all in-all out" system, indicated as a protective factor  <cit>  was adopted in  <dig> properties . farrow-to-finish management and routinely use of antibiotics in feed were associated with susceptibility to contamination of canadian herds  <cit> , however, the surveyed herds showed a widespread practice . cleaning and disinfection of the premises may also be related to lower prevalence  <cit> , but  <dig>  % of the  <dig> properties reported disinfect the facilities with some kind of disinfectant. presence of water depth in the growing and finishing facilities, a potential characteristic for bacteria maintenance in the environment  <cit> , was adopted by 90 % of the properties, a small discriminatory factor to associate with seropositivity.

CONCLUSIONS
l. intracellularis antibodies were present in all of the sampled herds in minas gerais, which indicates the high circulation of the agent in the state and the overall weighted pig seroprevalence in minas gerais was  <dig>  %. the predominant serological profile is consistent with that previously observed in herds from other countries, with finishing animals exhibiting the highest prevalence. “cleaning before disinfecting” was a protective factor against l. intracellularis infection at the herd level.
