BACKGROUND
molluscan feeding, with its repetitive protraction and retraction of the radula to ingest food, has provided a simple model system for the study of central pattern generator neuronal networks and of the way in which the pattern is reshaped by neuromodulators  <cit> . in the buccal ganglia of the pond snail, lymnaea stagnalis, octopamine is released by  <dig> octopamine-immunoreactive  interneurons  <cit>  onto all the identified neurons  in the buccal feeding system. the effects of octopamine are particularly interesting because it has a double role: both short-term  and long-term . the short term effects of the oc cells are to excite protraction phase neurons , inhibit retraction phase neurons , and make electrical connections with the neurons which fire in the same phase  of feeding cycle as the oc interneurons   <cit> . however, the synaptic outputs of the oc interneurons do not account for all the changes that these interneurons have on the feeding pattern: they also produce a long lasting  modulation of the feeding system. at the network level, the oc interneurons make the protraction phase modulatory interneurons  much more effective in driving fictive feeding, making the feeding pattern stronger and more robust. this effect can occur even if the oc interneuron is stimulated  <dig> s  before the protraction phase neurons  <cit> .

the network effects of the oc neurons can be accounted for by two cellular processes. first, they produce an increase in the excitability of the protraction phase interneurons , so that the same current pulse gives more action potentials. secondly, they increase the strength of the synapses made between protraction phase neurons, including the synapses from the so and n1l to the n1m cpg interneuron and b <dig> motoneuron. both these effects are mimicked by bath-applied octopamine in the range 1– <dig> μm, which is below the threshold at which octopamine directly depolarises the membrane potential  <cit> .

an increase in membrane excitability has been found to underlie many behavioural processes, including contributions to the modulation seen during learning  <cit>  and that seen in crustacean pattern generating networks  <cit> . in these systems, a variety of ionic mechanisms have been found to be substrates of the increase in excitability  <cit> . we now show that two of the three largest buccal motoneurons, b <dig> and b <dig> are more excitable in the presence of octopamine. in order to explore the changes in ionic currents by which the oc interneurons produce a change in excitability, we have voltage clamped these cells and examined the action of their transmitter, octopamine on their membrane currents. as a control, we also voltage clamped the b <dig> motoneuron which shows a decrease in excitability with octopamine. we have modelled the currents seen in the b <dig> with a hodgkin-huxley style simulation. we find that an increase in inward sodium current, of the same magnitude as that recorded in the voltage clamp, produces a lower threshold and an increase in excitability of the b <dig> motoneuron. an outline of this work, giving initial data, was recently published  <cit> 

RESULTS
octopamine increases the excitability of the b <dig> and b <dig>  but not b <dig> motoneuron
excitability experiments were performed in hi-di to decrease spontaneous synaptic inputs on the cell under study. this made the neurons silent and only the intracellular pulses were able to evoke action potentials. in hi-di saline, a series of depolarising pulses of increasing amplitude was used to determine the threshold and excitability of the b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> motoneurons . the averaged data show that the mean thresholds are just under  <dig> and  <dig>  na  and between  <dig> –  <dig> na . above threshold the number of action potentials increases with stimulus current, though the b <dig> curve starts to flatten off when six times the threshold current is applied, indicating a sigmoidal stimulus/response curve. 

in  <dig> μm octopamine, the threshold of the b <dig> and b <dig> motoneuron is reduced while the b <dig> threshold is increased. for supra-threshold currents, the b <dig> and b <dig> motoneuron generate more action potentials in octopamine than control saline, while b <dig> generates less. with two to four times threshold stimulus current, these differences are significant . with high stimulus currents, the sigmoidal curves for control and octopamine treatments start to merge together. the effect of octopamine on excitability is at least partially reversed by washing for  <dig> minutes.

outward currents are not affected by octopamine
when any of the three large buccal neurons, b <dig>  b <dig> or b <dig> are held in voltage clamp at - <dig> mv in normal saline, depolarizing pulses elicit an outward current . this outward current reaches its peak within  <dig> ms and is thereafter maintained for the duration of the  <dig> ms pulse. 

the sustained outward current activates at about - <dig> mv, and increases as the step becomes more positive . in the b <dig> neuron, its reversal potential is - <dig> ±  <dig>  mv  . this was determined by activating the outward current with a step to + <dig> mv, followed by clamping at values between - <dig> and - <dig> mv and measuring the tail currents. although well fitted by a straight line, some rectification is observed. the sustained outward current is blocked by tetraethylammonium  , like the delayed rectifier, ikv seen in other molluscan neurons  <cit> . the kinetics of the outward current, like that of anisodoris neurons  <cit> , is not well fitted by a single exponential raised to a power between  <dig> and  <dig>  while connor & stevens' data  <cit>  was fitted with the product of two terms, we achieved a better fit using the sum of two processes, suggesting that the b <dig> cell may have multiple outward currents. the more rapid component  corresponds with a steeply voltage-activated potassium current, while the slower process  may represent one of the other potassium currents, e.g. a calcium- activated potassium current  <cit> .

when the b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> neurons are stepped from a more negative holding potential, - <dig> mv, the outward current shows an initial peak that is not seen at - <dig> mv . the steady-state current is often the same as that reached when the holding potential was - <dig> mv. subtraction of the curves shows a rapidly activating, quickly inactivating outward current . this current reaches its peak after 3– <dig> ms and declines to 50% within 15– <dig> ms in the b <dig> and b <dig> motoneurons, while the half-life is less than  <dig> ms in the b <dig> motoneuron. it activates at - <dig> mv and increases as the potential becomes more positive . it is blocked by 4-aminopyridine  but not by tea . in these characteristics, it resembles the ia currents first recorded in molluscan neurons by connor & stevens  <cit>  and the two a currents reported by alekseev and ziskin  <cit> . over the first  <dig> ms, the rise and fall of the ia current is well fitted with the product of a single exponential, raised to the power  <dig> , and a single exponential . a linear approximation to the time constant gave a good fit over the range - <dig> to + <dig> mv. for the inactivation of ia, we did not use the lymnaea data of alekseev & zaykin  <cit> , because its half-inactivation at - <dig> mv predicts that holding at - <dig> mv should only give a small ia, whereas we found that holding at - <dig> mv gave a substantial ia . we therefore measured the inactivation of ia in the b <dig> motoneuron, giving a half-inactivation value of - <dig> mv , closer to the - <dig> mv determined by connor & stevens  <cit> .

the summary current-voltage relationship  shows that the peak outward currents are largest in the b <dig> neuron and smallest in the b <dig> neuron. the ratio of ia to ikv , measured from recordings of steps to  <dig> mv, is larger  in b <dig> than in b <dig> or b <dig> .

application of octopamine has no significant effect on the amplitude or activation voltage of either the delayed rectifier or transient components of the outward current in any of the b <dig>  b <dig> or b <dig> neurons . the inward currents last less than  <dig> ms before they are overtaken by outward currents. the inward current activates with the first step to - <dig> mv , and with the next few steps, the amplitude increases while the latency to the peak current decreases. in the b <dig> and b <dig> neurons, the peak inward current is reached when the step is to between - <dig> and - <dig> mv. we conclude from these properties that this current is a na+ current like those in other molluscan preparations  <cit> . this was confirmed by a series of saline replacement experiments. the current was not reduced when tea or 4-ap was applied; instead it was slightly increased , when sodium was removed from the saline , the inward current disappears completely.

the inward current transient was well fitted by the product of a rising exponential raised to the third power times a decaying exponential. the inward current activates and inactivates more quickly than reported in anisodoris  <cit>  or aplysia  <cit> , with lower minimum value and more negative voltage at which the time constant is half maximal  compared with other lymnaea cells  <cit> ).

in the b <dig> neuron, the maximum inward current is reached at - <dig> to - <dig> mv, and this suggests that the b <dig> inward current is different from the inward current measured on b <dig> and b <dig> 

bath applied octopamine,  <dig> μm, increases the size of the fast inward current in the b <dig> and b <dig> neurons, but no increase is seen in the b <dig> neuron . this is clear from the individual steps  where the size of the control inward current spike is shown by the dotted line: the b <dig> and b <dig> neurons respond to octopamine with a larger inward current. this is also reflected in the summarised current-voltage graphs . for the b <dig> neuron, the peak inward current is seen with steps to - <dig> mv and octopamine increases this from - <dig> ±  <dig> na to - <dig> ±  <dig> na . paired t-tests show that the increase in fast inward current is significant for steps in the range - <dig> mv to - <dig> mv . for b <dig>  the inward current at a step to - <dig> mv increases from - <dig> ±  <dig> to - <dig> ±  <dig> na  and the paired t-tests indicate a significant increase over most of the steps to - <dig> to - <dig> mv. the time for the inward current to reach its peak is not altered by the application of octopamine .

in contrast, for the b <dig>  the inward current in octopamine is not increased; rather it is less than in the control. at the peak current, seen with steps to - <dig> mv, the current in octopamine is 73% of the control; over the range - <dig> to + <dig> mv the inward current in octopamine is 77% of the control . however, only at the steps to - <dig> and + <dig> mv is the reduction statistically significant .

in molluscan neurons, the inward current may be carried not only by sodium but also by calcium ions  <cit> . in the experiments shown in fig.  <dig>  we used salines containing  <dig> μm cadmium to block the calcium component. in the presence of  <dig> mm tetraethylammonium , the delayed outward current is blocked . addition of  <dig> μm octopamine to this saline still increases the peak inward current, but leaves the size of the outward current unchanged . in another preparation, we blocked both transient and delayed outward currents, and any calcium current by using  <dig> mm tea,  <dig> mm 4-ap and  <dig> μm cadmium . addition of  <dig> μm octopamine to this saline still increases the fast inward current, confirming that the main effect of octopamine is on the fast inward na+ current . in this saline the increase is 20%, in the same range as seen in normal saline for the - <dig> mv voltage step .

basic physiology of the b <dig> motoneuron
the resting potential of the b <dig> motoneuron was  <dig> ±  <dig>  mv . action potentials had a threshold of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  na . the mean  time constant for hyperpolarising pulses was  <dig> ±  <dig> ms .

simulation
in voltage clamp simulations, the membrane potential was stepped from a holding voltage of - <dig> mv to - <dig> mv, and the simulation repeated, incrementing the step potential by  <dig> mv. the calculated sustained and transient outward currents  closely resemble the forms of the observed currents . over the range - <dig> to + <dig> mv, the sustained outward current tracks the iv curve  within one standard error at zero mv. the calculated ia current increases more slowly below  <dig> mv than the observed data, but becomes larger than the observed current thereafter. simulations run from - <dig> mv  show the ia reduced from  <dig> to  <dig> na peak for the step to + <dig> mv. under voltage clamp, the calculated inward current  is transient, with both the onset and decay becoming faster as the steps become more positive.

we have compared the calculated voltage clamp response with that from two representative preparations which had a holding potential of - <dig> mv . with a step to - <dig> mv, the calculated and actual currents agree well for the first  <dig>  ms, but thereafter the actual inward current is much larger. the sudden inflection in the trace suggests that this is the result of an action potential in the  contralateral b <dig> motoneuron. with steps to - <dig> to + <dig> mv the agreement between calculated and actual traces is similar to the variation between preparations. there is a good match for both the time of peak inward current, and also for the zero crossing mark. at  <dig> ms, the total current for the - <dig> mv and - <dig> mv is slightly lower than expected, but at + <dig> mv the calculated trace falls between the two observed traces.

solving the current clamp equations for the resting potential gave a stable value of - <dig>  mv . in the region - <dig> to - <dig> mv, the maintained outward current, ik, and the leak current dominate. the resting conductance of  <dig> ns, is the same as the value measured in seven preparations using a series of 6– <dig> hyperpolarising pulses  <dig> to  <dig> na,  <dig> to  <dig> s in duration, which gave a mean b <dig> conductance of  <dig> ±  <dig> ns . the capacitance of the cell was set at  <dig>  pf .

in current clamp simulations, positive currents led to depolarisation of the cell membrane. above  <dig>  na action potentials were produced  <dig> ms in duration, rising to + <dig> mv, with a noticeable after-hyperpolarisation . comparison of the shape with recorded action potentials indicates the model is good, though the peak depolarisation is not quite matched. the  <dig>  na threshold is within  <dig> standard error of that recorded in normal saline . increasing the stimulus current increases the number of action potentials seen in each  <dig> s of simulation .

to mimic the effect of  <dig> μm octopamine, the simulation was run with the maximal sodium conductance  increased by 33% , and this reduces the threshold to  <dig>  na. for each stimulus current, the simulation now produces more action potentials , e.g. at  <dig>  na the action potentials increase from  <dig> to  <dig> in the  <dig> ms run . reducing the inward conductance to 70% of its control value, to  <dig>  μs, raised the threshold and made the firing rate of the simulated cell slower.

in the snail feeding system, prolonged depolarisation may occur through the tonic release of octopamine, serotonin, peptides or other neuromodulators. although this might be expected to increase the firing of the cell, this is not always the case. in hodgkin-huxley simulations, addition of steady depolarising currents can lead to a reduction in activity, because the sodium channels become inactivated. we therefore modelled the effect of a continuous  <dig>  na depolarising current into the b <dig> on the number of action potentials produced by sharp current pulses. this changes the resting potential to - <dig> mv; it also lowers the threshold and increases the firing rate .

we also tested the effects of increasing the sodium channel conductance in two publicly available models of other molluscan neurons. the simplest model is the space-clamped hodgkin-huxley model of a squid axon which has only a single inward and single outward current. running the implementation by bezanilla  <cit>  the threshold to a  <dig> ms stimulus is reduced from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μa when the maximum sodium conductance  is increased by 33%. this also increases the excitability from  <dig> to  <dig> action potentials in the  <dig> ms,  <dig> μa pulse. we chose a model of the abdominal sensory neuron  <cit>  because this models a range of calcium and potassium currents and the calcium levels inside the cell and therefore treats more factors than our maple simulation. this is a good choice from the range of published snnap models because it seems possible that some of our potassium current may be calcium dependent. starting from the implementation downloaded in the snnap package, increasing g¯

discussion
octopamine enhances the excitability of b <dig> and b <dig> motoneurons
we have extended our previous observations that low concentrations of octopamine increase the excitability of buccal feeding interneurons  <cit>  to show that octopamine has the same effect on the b <dig> and b <dig> motoneurons. their action potential threshold is reduced, and supra-threshold stimuli evoke more action potentials in octopamine than normal saline. this is a specific cellular response, not some general effect, because the b <dig> motoneuron becomes less, not more, excitable. the behavioural consequence of this increase in excitability will be to make the motoneurons that drive feeding movement  more responsive to cpg input. their additional action potentials will serve to make the contractions of the muscles they innervate  more powerful. the effects on excitability work in conjunction with the synaptic effects, since the octopamine-containing  interneuron chemically excites b <dig>  and has an electrical synapse with b <dig>  <cit> . the next sections of the discussion address the cellular and ionic mechanism of this increase in excitability.

overview of the voltage activated currents in b <dig>  b <dig> and b4
the ionic currents in large molluscan neurons have been extensively analysed ever since the  <dig> microelectrode voltage clamp technique was introduced in the 1960s  <cit> . although the network connections of the lymnaea buccal neurons have been extensively analysed  <cit> , their ionic currents have not been described previously. each of the b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> motoneurons shows a transient and a delayed outward potassium current and an inward sodium current. these currents are similar to the accumulated data from other neurons in aplysia, helix and lymnaea  <cit> .

outward currents
both transient  and delayed outward potassium currents  are present in all three buccal motoneurons . ia and ikv activate at - <dig> and - <dig> mv respectively and are blocked separately by 4-ap and tea. the transient current is inactivated at a holding potential of - <dig> mv. the delayed potassium current has two kinetic components, one fast and steeply voltage dependent, and a slower one, which may be due to a calcium-activated potassium current. this would fit with both the kinetics and with the i-v curve from three neurons. in these, the iv curve was extended to + <dig> mv  and it sagged above + <dig> mv. a  <dig> ms prepulse to  <dig> mv abolishes the sag, and this suggests a role for a calcium-activated potassium current  <cit> .

each cell type has its own typical shape to its outward current trace. the most characteristic difference is that the transient current in the b <dig> motoneuron inactivates more quickly than that of the b <dig> or b <dig> neurons, and this may indicate differences in the ia subtypes expressed in the buccal motoneurons  <cit> . secondly, the magnitude of the current differs between cells, with the b <dig> neuron having more current in steps to, for example,  <dig> mv, than b <dig> or b <dig>  as the b <dig> neuron is smaller than b <dig>  this means that the channel density must be higher in b <dig>  thirdly, the shape of the outward current trace reflects the ratio of ia / ikv and this is larger in b <dig> than b <dig>  implying that expression of the channels are controlled independently.

we have no data suggesting the presence of two other common channel types, either s-channels or inward rectifiers, though straub & benjamin  <cit>  had predicted an ih current in b <dig> from current clamp recordings. hyperpolarizing steps to - <dig> to - <dig> mv showed no activating currents in any of the b <dig>  b <dig> or b <dig> motoneurons under our conditions.

inward currents
an inward transient sodium current , is the main inward current in the b <dig> and b <dig> cells, with the peak current seen in steps to - <dig> to - <dig> mv. however, the fast inward current in the b <dig> neuron differs, with the peak current occurring at less negative potentials, . this suggests that the b <dig> inward current may be a mixture of ina and a high-voltage activated  ca++ current. hva ca++ currents have been reported from isolated buccal neurons  <cit>  and from other lymnaea neurons, including the cgc  <cit>  and caudo-dorsal cells  <cit> .

effect of octopamine
at  <dig> μm, octopamine does not affect the resting membrane potential of the buccal neurons b <dig> and b <dig> although this concentration is enough to modulate their excitability.  <dig> μm octopamine is also enough to produce significant changes in the ionic currents evoked by voltage steps in the b <dig> and b <dig> motoneurons.

in the b <dig> and b <dig> neurons, low concentrations of octopamine, affect the inward, but not the outward currents. the mean value of the inward na+ current is increased by 33%  – 45% , and the difference is significant at the  <dig> % level for one and two data points. the octopamine i-v curve appears as an amplified version of the control, with similar maximal activation voltage. our simulations show that the effects produced by low concentrations of octopamine on the voltage activated currents will be synergistic to the effects of high  concentrations of octopamine on membrane potential, a depolarisation of about  <dig> mv  <cit> . at the b <dig> motoneuron, as octopamine arrives, it will increase excitability though an increase in the transient inward current; as the concentration increases, the membrane will depolarise so that the cell is closer to its threshold and fires faster in response to the same input.

in the b <dig> neuron,  <dig> μm octopamine has no effect on the voltage-activated outward currents. however, the b <dig> motoneuron differs from the b <dig> and b <dig> neurons, in that low concentrations of octopamine do not increase the fast inward current. in fact, octopamine reduces the fast inward current in the b <dig> motoneuron, though this is only just significant at the 5% level at two data points.

the effects of high concentrations of octopamine  on the b <dig> motoneuron are also different to their effect on the b <dig> and b <dig> cells  <cit> . high octopamine concentrations hyperpolarize the b <dig> cell, which will supplement the initial decrease in excitability seen at low concentrations of octopamine.

simulation of b1
we have modelled the voltage-activated currents of b <dig> motoneuron using a hodgkin-huxley style simulation, with a view to confirming that the 33% increase in inward sodium current confers an increase in excitability. in this model, we included a sustained outward current  and a transient outward current as well as the inward current. the architecture of this model resembles those devised by connor & stevens  <cit>  and those implemented using snnap  <cit> . as with these models it generates typical voltage clamp currents, a stable resting and action potential, which resemble the b <dig> data in shape and size. when positive current is applied, the difference between our data  and the simulation  is small: with the default parameters the threshold current modelled in silico  is within one standard error of the average recorded in vivo .

the main purpose of the simulation is to test in a quantitative manner the effects of increasing the inward sodium current on excitability. the simulation clearly shows that a 33% increase the maximum inward sodium reduces the threshold and enhances the firing rate in response to the same constant current stimulus. this increase in excitability when the inward sodium conductance is increased is preserved in our simulation when it is started with different parameters, for example when the maximum sustained outward current is reduced. when a small depolarising current is added to the simulation, a further increase in excitability is seen.

a decrease in threshold and increase in the spikes elicited by constant current pulses when the inward sodium current is increased is also seen in two other molluscan action potential simulations, of a gastropod sensory neuron and of the squid giant axon. thus an increase in inward sodium current seems to be a general mechanism for an increase in excitability, as it is seen in all  <dig> models we have used. conversely, a 33% reduction in the inward sodium conductance reduces excitability and increases the threshold.

mechanism for octopamine to increase b <dig> and b <dig> excitability
the octopamine – induced increase in the fast inward current means that depolarizing synaptic inputs will open more na+ channels and so be more likely to generate an action potential in the presence of octopamine. this provides a straightforward explanation of the increase in excitability, which was manifested in b <dig> and b <dig> as more action potentials were evoked for the same depolarising stimulus. we have confirmed this effect using in a quantitative simulation. our observation of octopamine-induced increase in ina in two cell types suggests that a similar cellular mechanism may underlie the increase of excitability of the so, n1l and n1m. our simulation also supports the idea that the decrease in excitability in the b <dig> motoneuron may result in part from the small decrease in inward current.

comparison with other mechanisms to increase excitability
a very wide range of neuromodulators have been shown to control the excitability of neurons in snails, crustacea and vertebrates. among these, modulation of inward currents has been demonstrated by amines  <cit>  and peptides  <cit> . changes in excitability may also arise from modulation of outward currents. in many cases, the behavioural context or endogenous source of the modulator is not clear, but this is not the case with the serotonergic modulation of gill-withdrawal in aplysia. in classical conditioning, reduction in iks underlies the increase in excitability, but an independent reduction in ikv increases spike width – for review see  <cit> . in another well-established model, hermissenda type b photoreceptors, an increase in excitability is produced by reduction in ia and the calcium-activated k+ current during conditioning  <cit> .

as well as changes during conditioning, modulation of neuronal excitability plays a fundamental part of the reconfiguration of neuronal networks. again, in many model systems, control of voltage activated channels occurs in synchrony with effects on resting membrane potential. this has been extensively explored in the stomatogastric ganglia of crustacea  <cit> , but these are hard to put in a behavioural context. voltage clamp data has been obtained from many neurons in molluscs, but in most cases the functional role is again missing.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that low concentrations of octopamine modulate the excitability of motoneurons in the snail feeding system. the changes in the inward sodium current quantitatively account for the increased excitability of the b <dig> motoneuron. thus, for the first time in molluscs, we are able to relate voltage clamp data using a quantitative simulation to a rhythmic network where we have a good data on how behavior is changed by the modulatory effect of octopamine  <cit> . the increase in inward sodium current provides an explanation for the polycyclic modulation of the feeding system by the oc interneurons. a similar effect on the so and n1l interneurons would well account for neuromodulation by the oc interneurons, making feeding easier to initiate and making the feeding bursts more intense  <cit> .
