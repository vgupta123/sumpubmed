BACKGROUND
the african wild dog  is an endangered canid species )  <cit> . while the species formerly ranged over most of sub-saharan africa, wild dogs suffer from a suite of threats including severe habitat fragmentation, human persecution, and disease epidemics. they are now restricted to less than seven percent of their former range  <cit> , with only small, and frequently declining, remnant populations in fragmented pockets of eastern and southern africa . they maintain enormous home ranges  and naturally live at very low densities, even compared to other carnivores  <cit> . primarily a hunter of antelopes, the african wild dog is a highly distinct canine. wild dogs are differentiated from other canine species by their anatomical adaptations related to hypercarnivory and cursorial hunting, including high-crowned, sectorial teeth and the lack of dewclaws  <cit> . they have a highly specialized social structure in which both males and females disperse to form new packs and only a single dominant pair in each pack reproduces  <cit> . wild dogs are also noted for their colorful pelage, from which they derive their species name pictus , and the absence of an undercoat.fig.  <dig> south african wild dog pack  and map of extant and former wild dog range . the sampling locations of the two individuals are noted on the map. ranges are modified from woodroffe and sillero-zubiri  <cit>  and marsden et al.  <cit> . extant range data used with permission from the international union for the conservation of nature . photograph by micaela szykman gunther




eastern and southern populations of wild dogs are genetically and morphologically distinct  <cit> , although there is a large admixture zone covering botswana, south-eastern tanzania, and zimbabwe  <cit> . gene flow occurs across the species’ entire range  <cit> , which is unsurprising given the excellent dispersal capabilities documented in lycaon pictus  <cit> . nevertheless, marsden et al.  <cit>  documented both genetic structuring between extant lycaon populations  and a recent reduction in effective population size  since the 1980s. furthermore, african wild dogs exhibit very little major histocompatibility complex variation, which may reflect population decline  <cit> .

to better understand african wild dog genomic evolution, genetic variation and population history, we shotgun sequenced whole genomes from two individuals from widely separated populations with very different modern ecological histories: laikipia county, kenya and hluhluwe-imfolozi park, kwazulu-natal province, south africa. wild dogs disappeared from laikipia, kenya in the 1980s and reappeared in  <dig> – likely recolonizing from a small population in neighboring samburu district . the population in laikipia alone now numbers more than  <dig> dogs and  <dig> packs  <cit> . we sequenced a female  from this recolonized population. in contrast, wild dogs were reintroduced to hluhluwe-imfolozi park, kwazulu-natal province in  <dig> and remained as a single pack for many years  <cit> . eventually, lycaon breeding effectively ceased until new animals were introduced in  <dig> and afterwards   <cit> . the kwazulu-natal wild dogs are now managed as part of the south african lycaon “metapopulation”  <cit> . we sequenced a male , born in kwazulu-natal to parents that were translocated from limpopo province in  <dig>  therefore, the south african individual’s ancestry represents genes from the northeastern part of the country.

the genomes from these two populations represent some of the first published wild canid genomes and are particularly valuable given the susceptibility of wild dogs to diseases and habitat fragmentation  <cit> . we used our novel genome sequences to reconstruct the last  <dig> , <dig> years of lycaon genome demography and population history. we identified over a million polymorphic sequence variants for further population-level study. these variants produced ~ <dig> million predicted genic effects. we identified over  <dig>  candidate genes that may have undergone adaptation since the lycaon/canis divergence. we found evidence of positive selection on the lycaon mitochondrial genome. finally, we examined genes involved in canid coat phenotype to identify candidate genes underlying the characteristic lycaon pelage.

RESULTS
genome sequencing of the african wild dog
based on alignment with the domestic dog genome, we have sequenced ~90%  of the kenyan individual’s genome and ~93%  of the south african lycaon individual’s genome. we identified  <dig> , <dig> autosomal sequence variants  separating our lycaon genomes from the domestic dog  genome    <cit> . of these,  <dig> , <dig>  were polymorphic in the african wild dog. the remaining  <dig> , <dig> autosomal sequence variants  were monomorphic in the two lycaon individuals. we identified  <dig>  x-chromosomal variants , of which  <dig>   were polymorphic and  <dig>   were monomorphic in the african wild dog. additionally, we sequenced the kenyan and south african wild dog mitochondrial genomes to depths of 943× and 1021×, respectively. we annotated the lycaon autosomal and x-chromosomal sequences using the domestic dog genome annotations  and the mitochondrial genome  and msy sequences  using their reference sequence annotations .

lycaon demographic history
we analyzed the two wild dogs’ autosomal population histories using psmc   <cit> . both genomes exhibited a strong reduction in n
e starting  <dig>  years ago from maximum n
es of ~ <dig>   and ~ <dig>   individuals and leveling off  <dig>  years ago at n
es of ~ <dig>  individuals each. analysis of the kenyan individual’s x - chromosomal history using psmc showed a similar pattern . n
e fell from a maximum of ~ <dig>  individuals  <dig>  years ago to ~ <dig> individuals  <dig>  years ago. this n
e reduction may represent a past population bottleneck e.g.  <cit>  or lineage splitting e.g.  <cit> . further genomic analysis of individuals from across the lycaon range, especially those from larger founder populations, would help clarify the cause of this pattern.fig.  <dig> reconstruction of the lycaon individuals’ autosomal and x-chromosomal demographic history using the pairwise sequentially markovian coalescent. initial results are plotted using dark-colored curves, with the bootstrap replicates plotted in lighter hues of the corresponding colors




psmc analysis of the kenyan x chromosome revealed a secondary reduction in n
e started  <dig>  years ago to a final n
e of ~ <dig> individuals  <dig>  years ago. we are unable to infer more recent population history accurately using this method due to the limited numbers of available mutations in the short time frame  <cit> . further research using historical museum lycaon specimens would fill in this temporal gap e.g.  <cit> . while our reconstructions were robust to coverage variation , higher coverage genomes would also increase the resolution of population history reconstructions  <cit> .

candidate selected processes and genomic regions
based on the domestic dog genome annotations, snpeff  <dig>  l predicted that the identified lycaon autosomal and x-chromosomal sequence variants would cause  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> genic effects in the kenyan and south african individuals, respectively   <cit> . the majority of sequence variant effects fell within introns  and intergenic regions . to discover candidate genes that have diverged since lycaon’s divergence with canis, we identified lycaon genes that contained missense mutations and stop codon gains using snpsift  <dig>  l  <cit> . we identified  <dig>   kenyan and  <dig>  south african wild dog candidate divergent genes.  <dig> divergent genes  were found in both wild dogs. these divergent genes were determined by  <dig>  kenyan sequence variants  of and  <dig>  south african variants .  <dig>  variants were shared between the two lycaon individuals. these variants were very homozygous , which suggests that they are the result of divergence between the lycaon and canis clades, rather than more recent variants arising within lycaon.

we annotated the candidate divergent genes’ functions using david  <dig>  with domestic dog  as the genomic background  <cit> . we found  <dig> and  <dig> enriched processes in the kenyan and south african individuals, respectively . we filtered these terms with a benjamini-hochberg false discovery rate of  <dig>   <cit> . after filtration, seven terms  were significantly enriched in the kenyan individual. ‘olfactory transduction’ was significant in the south african individual. the differences in significant terms may reflect population-specific selection pressures on wild dogs. further population-level investigation is needed to determine the roles these pathways play in lycaon evolution.

in order to identify regions of low and high diversity, we calculated the numbers of segregating snp sites across the lycaon autosomes in  <dig>  bp non-overlapping windows using vcftools  <dig> . <dig>   <cit> . by averaging over large genomic windows, we limited the effects of sequencing errors and allelic drop-out due to low sequencing coverage. we identified  <dig>  segregating lycaon snps . we observed individual-specific regions of low diversity . the kenyan individual had runs of low diversity  on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  while the south african individual had runs of low diversity on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  these low-diversity regions may be the result of inbreeding and/or population-specific natural selection. due to the long lengths of these low-diversity runs, encompassing numerous genes, we are not currently able to link low diversity levels to selection on individual genes. these results are not surprising since both populations are recently re-established, either by natural recolonization  or deliberate reintroduction . previous genetic investigations using microsatellites and mitochondrial dna found some evidence of rare inbreeding in wild dogs from the greater limpopo transfrontier conservation area and kwazulu-natal  <cit> . however, free-ranging wild dogs strongly avoid incestuous matings  <cit> . for instance, at kwazulu-natal, becker et al.  <cit>  observed only one of six breeding pairs being more closely related than third-order kin. while our chromosomal diversity data do not permit us to discern between inbreeding and/or population-specific natural selection, the possibility of inbreeding is, therefore, concerning from a conservation standpoint. additional population-level data are required to determine the causes and effects of these low-diversity regions.fig.  <dig> segregating autosomal snp sites across the lycaon genomes. chromosomes are distinguished by color and separated by black lines. the number of segregating snps per  <dig>  bp window is plotted on the y-axis in logarithmic scale. we identified population-specific regions of low diversity in both the kenyan  and south african  individuals. there are also highly variable regions on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in both individuals, chromosome  <dig> in the kenyan individual, and chromosome  <dig> in the south african individual




we also identified regions of high diversity  on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in both individuals and chromosome  <dig> in the south african individual . the high-diversity regions comprised  <dig> % of the total segregating snps in both individuals and included  <dig> kenyan and  <dig> south african segregating snps on chromosome  <dig>  kenyan and  <dig> south african segregating snps on chromosome  <dig>  and  <dig> south african segregating snps on chromosome  <dig>  using the ucsc genome browser  <cit> , we scanned the genome within  <dig>  bp upstream and downstream of these high-diversity regions for known genes mapped to canfam <dig> . these included fer, fkbp <dig>  snrpf, and pja <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  hus <dig> and pkdil <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  and rnf <dig> and tbc1d <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  these genic regions may have undergone positive or relaxed selection since the lycaon/canis divergence or may represent chromosomal duplications. future functional analyses will determine which roles  these genes play in lycaon evolution.

positive selection on the mitochondrial genome
each of the  <dig> protein-encoding mitochondrial genes from the two novel lycaon mitochondrial genomes were aligned against the corresponding genic sequences from the domestic dog mitochondrial reference sequence and the one publically available near-complete lycaon pictus mitochondrial genome sequence   <cit> . we calculated ratios of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site  and tested for positive selection using the codon-based z-test in mega <dig>  <cit> . we found evidence for positive selection on  <dig> of  <dig> genes . to determine whether selection occurred primarily on the lycaon or canis branches, we reran these analyses excluding the domestic dog sequence. we found evidence for positive selection on all  <dig> lycaon mitochondrial genes .

to confirm branch specific signatures of selection, we aligned the lycaon cytb sequences against published canid taxa  using mafft  <dig>   <cit>  as implemented in geneious  <dig> . <dig> . we then generated a phylogenetic tree with fasttree  <dig>   <cit> . using the ‘codonml’ algorithm in paml  <dig>   <cit> , we performed pairwise comparisons on cytb codon data and compared the likelihood of the alternate  or null hypotheses . a likelihood ratio test was calculated from ln values obtained from these comparisons to determine where evidence of selection was occurring in canids. we found significant evidence  of positive selection between african wild dogs and coyotes   and between lycaon and cuon . we also found branch-specific selection between the kenyan and south african lycaon individuals .

the  <dig> candidate selected lycaon mitochondrial genes are involved in the electron transport chain and adenosine triphosphate synthesis. this suggests natural selection on lycaon metabolic processes e.g.  <cit> , which is likely given their unique antelope hunting strategies and diet. moreover, these results are consistent with african wild dogs’ very high metabolic rate and hunting energy expenditure in comparison to domestic dogs  <cit> .

pelage genes
we extracted cds corresponding to  <dig> genes involved in canid coat color  and type   using geneious  <dig> . <dig>  in cases where there were multiple isoforms or cds annotations , we chose the longest variant alignable to the domestic dog cds reference sequence to maximize detection power. to detect positively selected genes, we identified non-synonymous and synonymous snps compared to the domestic dog sequence and calculated the non-synonymous/synonymous  ratio .


asip and pmel had elevated n/s ratios suggestive of positive selection . lycaon pmel also had a stop codon gain at amino acid  <dig>  suggesting selection at this locus. additionally, we found a threonine insertion at amino acid  <dig> in the lycaon mlph gene and a six amino acid deletion corresponding to domestic dog amino acids 186– <dig> in the lycaon mitf gene. to further characterize these four candidate genes, we compared the lycaon coding sequences against all publically available canid sequences using blast+  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . none of the lycaon asip, pmel, mitf, and mlph cds haplotypes have been identified in other canids previously. lycaon asip shares 99% nucleotide identity, but only 96% amino acid identity, with domestic dogs. wild dog pmel shares both 99% nucleotide identity and amino acid identity with domestic dogs. excluding the six amino acid deletion, lycaon mitf haplotypes had >99% nucleotide and amino acid identity with domestic dogs. lycaon mlph haplotypes had 98% nucleotide identity and 97–98% amino acid identity  to domestic dogs.

these four genes are strong candidates to explain the characteristic lycaon pelage. mutations in asip alter relative production of eumelanin and pheomelanin, resulting in lighter and darker hair colors, in numerous species including domestic dogs  <cit> . variants in pmel cause merle patterning in domestic dogs  <cit> . mitf is associated with white-spotting phenotypes in domestic dogs and causes coat color variants in laboratory mice . mitf variants are also associated with deafness, small eye size, and poor bone resorption in mice  <cit> . nevertheless, further laboratory assays  are needed to confirm that these identified variants are functional and to determine their phenotypic effects. furthermore, our data do not permit us to distinguish between positive selection on the lycaon and canis branches .

CONCLUSIONS
we provide two genome sequences of lycaon pictus, representing two individuals from highly divergent ecological regions . we identified over a million polymorphic lycaon snps, useful for further population-level analyses. analyses of these genomes showed that extant lycaon populations have endured at least two population contractions within the last  <dig> , <dig> years. we identified chromosomal regions of high and low diversity and over  <dig>  candidate divergent genes. furthermore, lycaon mitochondrial genomes have undergone positive selection, suggestive of selection for metabolic processes. finally, we identified four candidate genes  that may be involved in lycaon pelage patterns.
