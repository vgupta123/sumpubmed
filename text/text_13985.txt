BACKGROUND
understanding transcriptional regulation is one of the main goals of the post-genomic era. transcriptional regulation is a very complex biological phenomenon that is controlled by many factors  <cit> . here, we focus on the transcriptional regulation mediated by discrete, genomic  regions called cis-regulatory modules . each crm responds independently to a particular set of tfs, and causes a particular level of transcription to occur at the promoter it controls. crms might therefore be involved in "situation-specific" gene expression . to understand what role crms are playing in "situation-specific" gene expression, we need computational models that predict the genomic location of the crm responsible for triggering the expression of the target gene in a specific situation. similarly important are computational models that predict the transcription rate mediated by a given dna sequence. those models can be applied to identify dna regions with regulatory functions.

here, we present a single computational model applicable to both prediction tasks on a specific gene in d. melanogaster. our approach is distinct from previously reported crm predictors  because it not only predicts the location of putative crms, but also assigns a specific transcriptional response to a single crm. to accommodate the second prediction task, the model can also be used to predict the transcription rate of the target gene mediated by any dna sequence.

to achieve this, we extend a recently-developed, steady-state, quantitative model of the transcriptional regulation of a particular gene in the fruit-fly   <cit> . this model was originally described by reinitz et al.  <cit> , and will be referred to herein as the "reinitz" model. earlier work successfully tested the reinitz model on the even-skipped gene  in d. melanogaster, which controls segmentation in the fruit-fly and is expressed in seven stripes along the anteroposterior axis in the embryo  <cit> . more specifically, they applied the model to the crm controlling the second  stripe. this crm is called "minimal stripe element two" , and is located  <dig>  kb upstream of the eve gene  <cit> .

the ability of the reinitz model to describe the output of mse <dig> is of particular interest in light of a very recent study by segal et al.  <cit> . they studied a different mathematical model of regulation in d. melanogaster that fails to predict the output of mse <dig> correctly. one of the reasons that the reinitz model accurately models the behavior of mse <dig> might be that a different regulatory role was assigned to one of the tfs, hunchback . segal et al. used hb as repressor while janssens et al. used it as activator. another difference between the approaches is that the reinitz model was applied to a very detailed measurements of the output of mse <dig> and the seven controlling tfs-hb, bicoid , caudal , giant , kr√ºppel , knirps  and tailless   <cit> . this also sets the reinitz model apart from other modeling approaches introduced by bolouri et al.  <cit>  and zinzen et al.  <cit> .

the reinitz model aims to simulate the tf-dna binding and interaction events. it divides the set of regulators into activators and repressors, here called "quenchers". the model contains adjustable parameters that describe the maximal transcription rate  and the energy barrier . in addition, the parameter set also contains two variables for each tf that define its ability to bind to the dna  and its effectiveness as a quencher or activator, . the model predicts the transcriptional output of a promoter due to the action of a particular crm, where the crm is represented by a transcription factor binding site map  specifying the positions and binding strengths of all binding sites for the set of tfs. tfbs binding strengths are given as log-odds scores derived from a position weight matrix  for the corresponding tf.

janssens et al.  <cit>  first applied the reinitz model to the mse <dig> in d. melanogaster. they used a mixture of predicted and experimentally verified tfbss, which we will refer to as "knowledge-based" tfbss. they also introduced additional free parameters to the original reinitz model that allow for individual binding site affinities that are not in agreement with the theoretical justification for the reinitz model. we refer to this variation of the original model as the "janssens model".

janssens et al.  <cit>  showed that the janssens model could be trained to fit the data on the expression level of eve at different times and locations in the developing d. melanogaster embryo. they also showed that the model correctly predicts  the effect on eve expression in a d. melanogaster mutant lacking one tf . in addition, they showed that the model correctly predicts qualitative changes in anteroposterior location of eve expression, as well as increases and decreases in expression, caused by various mutations of tfbss.

janssens et al.  <cit>  primarily studied the ability of a variation of the reinitz model to accurately describe transcriptional output of the eve gene in d. melanogaster as a function of the concentration of certain tfs and their predicted binding to a particular crm. the current work, however, aims to use the original reinitz model in the two predictive tasks stated above: to predict the transcriptional output of the eve mse <dig> in d. melanogaster, and to predict the genomic location of mse <dig> in d. melanogaster and other drosophila species.

an additional objective of the current work is the verification of the generalization accuracy of the janssens model. by generalization accuracy, we refer to how well the model captures the underlying mechanisms of transcriptional regulation, rather than just fitting the training data. we do this using standard cross-validation.

it is believed that the eve gene in other drosophila species is subject to the same regulatory mechanisms as it is in d. melanogaster. while the function is conserved, the mse <dig> sequence and the extent of the regulatory region has changed. ludwig et al.  <cit>  investigated d. pseudoobscura and three close relatives to d. melanogaster. they found that a dna fragment containing the mse <dig> from the other species was able to drive the correct stripe  <dig> expression when combined with a lacz reporter and transfected into d. melanogaster.

to investigate if the reinitz model correctly predicts the stripe  <dig> expression given the mse <dig> regions from other species, we train the model on the mse <dig> region in d. melanogaster, and evaluate its predictions on the mse <dig> regions in seven other drosophila species. the goal is to confirm the ability of the model to correctly predict the transcriptional output mediated by the crm in other species. this will verify the assumption that, though the mse <dig> region has evolved, the regulatory mechanisms have stayed the same  <cit> .

to investigate the ability of our approach to identify the location of a specific crm, we use it in a simple dna scanning algorithm. the task is to identify the mse <dig> region in the dna sequence surrounding eve in d. melanogaster and other species of drosophila by finding the dna region that the model predicts will produce the correct transcriptional output. this will determine the specificity of the model in distinguishing between the true mse <dig> and other tfbs-clusters with tfbss of the same set of tfs but with "wrong" order, spacing and quantity.

the previous work by janssens applied  the reinitz model to tfbs-maps with mainly experimentally-validated tfbss. however, in general, only a small fraction of functional tfbss are experimentally validated. therefore, for the model more generally applicable in a scanning algorithm, it should be able to function well using tfbs-maps consisting solely of predicted tfbss. however, because in silico prediction of tfbss is notoriously error-prone  <cit> , the model needs to be robust enough to cope with wrongly predicted and missing tfbss. we investigate the robustness by comparing the performance of the janssens model with the reinitz model using predicted-only tfbs-maps for mse <dig> 

RESULTS
 <dig>  assessing the generalization accuracy of the janssens model
to assess the performance of the benchmark model-the janssens model-from a machine learning point of view, we reproduce a modification of the experiment reported by janssens et al.  <cit> . rather than training on the full data set as done by janssens et al.  <cit> , we performed a seven fold cross-validation  . briefly, the data consists of measurements taken at seven time points during the early development of the d. melanogaster embryo. we train the model on all data corresponding to six of the seven time points, and test on the remaining data. we repeat this seven times, leaving out each time point once. the accuracy of the model on each of the seven held-out data sets is a measure of its ability to generalize to unseen data. because the training process is stochastic and not guaranteed to converge to the optimum parameter values, we repeat the training  <dig> times for each fold of cross-validation, starting the optimization from different randomly-selected parameter values each time.

the janssens model is able to fit the training data quite well, with an average  root-mean-squared  error over the six training time points, seven cv-folds and  <dig> repeats of  <dig>  . this is an average error of  <dig> % of the maximal observed mrna expression rate. though the testing  error is larger- <dig>  -, fig.  <dig> shows that the characteristic expression of eve generated by mse <dig> is qualitatively correctly predicted.

 <dig>  using predicted-only tfbs-maps
in order to use the reinitz model as part of a scanning algorithm capable of identifying dna regions with regulatory function, it is desirable that the model is applicable to any dna sequence. this means that the approach should be based on predicted tfbss only. in this section we train the reinitz model using predicted sites and compare its performance to the performance of the janssens model. the tfbs prediction for our model is done as described in methods sec.  <dig> , and results in  <dig> tfbss compared to the  <dig> "knowledge-based" sites used by janssens et al.  <cit> .

tab.  <dig> shows the comparison between the janssens model and our model using predicted tfbss. again the reported rms errors are an average over the six time points and  <dig> independent runs in each of the seven cv folds. the janssens model fits the training data slightly better . the difference in the training error is small, but statistically significant . however, in terms of the generalization accuracy , the models are indistinguishable . the better ability of the janssens model to fit the training data might be due to the additional free parameters. these additional parameters appear to enable a closer fit to the training data, while not aiding in capturing the underlying mechanisms of transcriptional regulation, as evidenced by the statistically indistinguishable testing error of the two models.

the table shows the average  rms error for three independent training runs using the janssens model  and our model , respectively. training was done using the simulated annealing algorithm. for the model using predicted sites, we used a log-odds threshold of  <dig> bits and the d. melanogaster background base frequencies with a total pseudo-count of  <dig> .

the above experiment indicates that it should be possible to use the reinitz model trained on predicted-only tfbss  as part of a scanning algorithm. we therefore train a final model , trained on all time points. it achieves an average training error over the  <dig> independent repeats of  <dig>  . we noticed that the data points from time points t <dig> and t <dig> are very similar to each other . in order to avoid biasing the model, we also evaluate a second final model , which is trained on a "redundancy-reduced" training set, where all data from time point t <dig> is removed. this model has a training error of  <dig>  . the output of both models is shown in fig.  <dig> and the trained parameter values are given in the supplementary material .

 <dig>  predicting the exact location of mse <dig> in other drosophila species
it is believed that the transcriptional output of eve mediated by mse <dig> and the protein concentration of the seven tfs have stayed the same despite the speciation  <cit> . a good indication of the generality of the reinitz model is therefore its ability to accurately predict the mse <dig> location and its mediated transcriptional output in other drosophila species. to test this, we apply trainedall model and trainedminust <dig> model, trained on the mse <dig> in d. melanogaster, to all windows in the  <dig> kb surrounding the eve gene in d. melanogaster and other drosophila species . we measure the rms error for all time points by comparing the predicted output using the mse <dig> in a given species with the known transcriptional output for d. melanogaster. since we do not know the exact extent of the mse <dig> in the other species we consider all window sizes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp , and compute the rms error of the prediction from each window compared with the known transcriptional output of d. melanogaster for all time points. the window with the lowest rms error-the "optimal window"-is then the predicted mse <dig>  to measure the prediction accuracy, we calculate the performance coefficient   <cit>  using the sequences aligned to mse <dig> in d. melanogaster in the ucsc alignments  <cit>   as the "gold standard" for the location and extent of mse <dig> in the other species.

we compare the ability of our model to predict the location and extent of mse <dig> in the various drosophila species with the cluster-buster algorithm. cluster-buster searches a dna sequence for clusters of matches to the set of motifs in its input. we provide cluster-buster with the same seven pwms as used by our model. cluster-buster allows the user to set a parameter controlling the expected gap length between sites in a cluster. we ran cluster-buster with gap lengths from one to  <dig> and report the highest pc achieved in fig.  <dig>  to calculate pc for our method, an rms threshold must be chosen . we compute the average pc of the  <dig> trainedall models and trainedminust <dig> models using different rms thresholds ranging from zero to  <dig>  and report the highest pc achieved. as can be seen in fig.  <dig>  the predictive accuracy of our models is competitive or better than cluster-buster in three of the seven species other than d. melanogaster . on two distant species  both models are markedly inferior to cluster-buster. surprisingly, the trainedminust <dig> model does extremely well at predicting the location of mse <dig> in the distantly related species d. willistoni. the results also indicate that the inclusion of time point t <dig> may be biasing the model toward the later time points. although the trainedminust <dig> model achieves a better maximum pc than trainedall model for only two species , the region with the lowest rms error overlaps mse <dig> on average in  <dig>  species  compared with  <dig>  species for the trainedall models .

the performance of our model is illustrated by the predictions made by the trainedminust <dig> model with the best training error amongst the  <dig> repeats, herein referred to as "best trainedminust <dig> model". fig. 5a shows that the known  mse <dig> overlaps the best scoring window predicted by our best trainedminust <dig> model in six out of eight species. for the two species where the optimal window does not overlap mse <dig>  the rms errors at the mse <dig> region are among the lowest as shown in fig.  <dig>  also shown in the table is the prediction accuracy achieved by the optimal window over all time points.

to investigate if the predictive accuracy in the other drosophila species is mainly due to the similarity of its mse <dig> region to that of d. melanogaster, we compare the tfbs-map of the window with the best rms error to the tfbs-map of the training window in d. melanogaster using the tfbs-map alignment tool mmeta  <cit> . except for d. melanogaster itself, the mmeta scores are very low, indicating that only a small number of tfbss in the two maps can be aligned. therefore, the tfbs-maps in the regions predicted by the best trainedminust <dig> model differ significantly from the mse <dig> tfbs-map for d. melanogaster. the mmeta scores for the predicted mse <dig> regions and the ucsc-aligned regions are almost the same  in all but one species, indicating that the tfbs-map from the window predicted by trainedminust <dig> model can be aligned to the tfbs-map from d. melanogaster with the same quality as the homologous mse <dig> sequence identified by ucsc. interestingly, in d. ananassae the homologous mse <dig> sequence achieves a better mmeta score than the trainedminust <dig> model-predicted window. this means, that though the tfbss in the homologous region can be better aligned to the ones from the training region in d. melanogaster, the predicted output is worse than the one mediated by the predicted window, whose tfbss can not be aligned very well to the mse <dig> in d. melanogaster. which of the positions is the true mse <dig> for d. ananassae can only be determined in wet-lab experiments.

the tfbs-maps for the predicted regions and ucsc aligned mse2s as well as a multiple alignment are shown in the supplementary material .

fig. 5b illustrates how well the predicted transcriptional response mediated by the optimal windows fit the observed mrna concentrations. this is particular surprising for the optimal windows that do not overlap the mse <dig> . if not an artifact, they might be additional mse <dig> regions. small et al.  <cit>  found that regions outside the mse <dig> aid in increasing the expression level of stripe  <dig>  their observation was limited to regions within  <dig> kb upstream of eve. however, it may be that there are additional enhancers within the  <dig> kb eve locus.

 <dig>  predicting the exact location of mse <dig> in d. melanogaster
as part of the previous experiment, we evaluate the prediction of the best trainedminust <dig> model using tfbs-maps corresponding to all windows of various sizes in the  <dig> kb surrounding eve. this detects a window near eve in d. melanogaster with the same rms error as the training window, but  <dig> bp shorter. fig. 6a shows the location of the shorter window relative to the  <dig> bp long training window.

the  <dig> bp of the extended mse <dig> region used for training was constructed by janssens et al.  <cit>  to demonstrate that the sequence downstream of the annotated mse <dig> has regulatory function and can mediate a weak stripe  <dig> expression. the extended mse <dig> has, therefore, a strong stripe  <dig> and weak stripe  <dig> expression in contrast to the annotated mse <dig>  which only mediates the stripe  <dig> expression  <cit> . since there was no wet-lab experiment undertaken to identify the minimal region able to evoke stripe  <dig> and stripe  <dig> expression, it is likely that the  <dig> bp construct contains sequence parts with no regulatory function. the shorter  window identified in-silico may therefore be the minimal sequence element evoking the observed pattern, especially because it fully contains mse <dig> and extends the region only a short stretch downstream.

the predicted outputs of the three regions are shown in fig. 6b. while the predicted window and the training window produce the same output, the predicted response for the annotated mse <dig> is very low. but, as expected, there is only a transcriptional response predicted for stripe  <dig>  and no response at the location of stripe  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we have introduced a computational tool to predict the transcriptional output mediated by the predicted tfbs-map of a specific crm. we have generalized a recently developed mathematical model to make it applicable to any dna sequence. we have demonstrated the ability of the model to predict the transcriptional response and the location of the mse <dig> region in other drosophila species. in six out of the eight drosophila species, the model identifies the correct position as the window with the lowest rms error. the overall low rms error indicates that the model captures the underlying mechanism of transcriptional regulation and generalizes to control regions in other species.

however, preliminary studies  indicate that the current reinitz model fails to generalize to crms other than mse <dig>  this is in agreement with the recent study by segal et al.  <cit> , where their model fails specifically for mse <dig>  but succeeds for several other crms in various drosophila genes. this suggests that the biological mechanism involved in the regulation of mse <dig> may be different than that of other enhancers. this is particularly the case for the transcription factor hb, which seems to be an activator in mse <dig> while it seems to be a repressor in other enhancers  <cit> . how and why the regulatory mechanism can be different for mse <dig> although the same set of tfs are involved remains to be investigated. particularly, the proposed cooperativity between hb and bcd may enable hb to be an activator for the regulation of mse <dig> 

we further plan to substitute the biologically unrealistic discrete tfbss with continuous binding gradients over the dna. an interesting intermediate step would be to use tfbss predicted by cluster-buster, where the reported tfbss are not chosen based merely on their pwm scores, but by taking their location relative to other tfbss into account.
