BACKGROUND
inorganic phosphate  is an essential nutrient required for signal transduction, energy metabolism, and biochemistry in all organisms. maintaining a constant, stable concentration of internal inorganic phosphate is a major challenge for biological systems. because external concentrations of inorganic phosphate fluctuate unpredictably, microorganisms have evolved strategies to sense external phosphate levels  <cit> , communicate this information to the nucleus  <cit> , and induce transcription to respond to phosphate flux  <cit> . the phosphate signal transduction  pathway in the budding yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, is the most thoroughly studied example of phosphate homeostasis in eukaryotes  <cit> .

the transcription factors pho <dig> and pho <dig> play a key role in the phosphate starvation response in s. cerevisiae. when cells are grown in conditions where inorganic phosphate is plentiful, pho <dig> is multiply phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinase-cyclin  complex, pho85-pho <dig>  <cit> . when pho <dig> is phosphorylated, it is localized to the cytoplasm  <cit> , does not interact with pho <dig>  <cit> , and the pho regulon is not expressed. during phosphate starvation, the cdk inhibitor pho <dig> binds to the secondary metabolite myo-d-inositol heptakisphosphate  and inhibits the pho85-pho <dig> complex  <cit> . inhibition of pho85-pho <dig> allows pho <dig> to be dephosphorylated, enter the nucleus  <cit> , co-operate with pho <dig>  <cit> , and induce a set of genes responsible for harvesting inorganic phosphate from the environment  <cit> . pho <dig> function can be conveniently monitored by measuring the activity of the secreted acid phosphatase, pho <dig>  which is one of the most highly induced members of the pho response  <cit> . the genes that comprise the pho regulon have been well characterized and the precise sites within the genome where pho <dig> binds during phosphate starvation are known  <cit> . pho <dig> regulation occurs in response to changes in external phosphate levels and pho <dig> activity is not thought to be regulated by other stress responses.

in this study we ask the following: is the pho transcriptional response observed in s. cerevisiae conserved in the distantly related ascomycete, schizosaccharomyces pombe? s. pombe presents an interesting opportunity for addressing this question because:  s. pombe did not experience a recent whole-genome duplication event – thought to contribute to specialization  <cit>  – possibly preventing the pho response from developing a dedicated regulatory network;  the orthologs for the pho pathway either do not exist  or are not involved in the pho response  in s. pombe <cit> ; and  recent work utilizing a deletion collection in s. pombe has outlined a basic regulatory structure for the pi-inducible, secreted acid phosphatase pho1+  creating an opportunity for comparison with the s. cerevisiae pho response  <cit> . during phosphate starvation s. pombe pho <dig> – a putative transcription factor containing a zn2cys <dig> binuclear cluster  <cit>  – activates pho1+ expression. csk <dig> – a cdk-activating kinase-activating kinase   <cit>  – represses pho1+ expression in high-pi conditions. epistasis analysis indicates that pho <dig> acts downstream of csk <dig> 

in this study, we explore how these factors affect transcriptional output by characterizing the pho transcriptional response in s. pombe. we analyze this response as a function of phosphate, pho <dig>  and csk <dig> availability using dna microarrays. we delineate a core pho transcriptional response comprising the genes pho1+, spbc8e <dig> c , and spbc <dig>  , whose induction in response to phosphate starvation is conserved between s. cerevisiae and s. pombe. interestingly, while these three genes share a functionally analogous regulatory pathway  we find that the mechanism for regulation differs widely between species. our analysis of the pho7-regulated transcriptional output – coupled with a global profile of pho <dig> binding to promoters of stress responsive genes – leads us to the conclusion that, unlike pho <dig>  pho <dig> plays a role in multiple stress response pathways. we conclude that while there is a core pho transcriptional response shared between these two ascomycetes, the systems logic and specialization of pho components varies widely.

RESULTS
pho7+ and csk1+ regulate a core subset of the pho response in s. pombe
the kinetics and maximal output of transcription vary widely between different environmental stress response pathways  <cit> . to outline the specific pho response in s. pombe for subsequent analysis, and to avoid indirect activation of non-phosphate starvation regulated genes, we performed a single time-dependent, genome-wide expression analysis of wild-type s. pombe cells in medium lacking inorganic phosphate .

the starvation time-course revealed two distinct responses to phosphate starvation. the rapid response contained  <dig> genes that exhibited an increase in expression at  <dig> minutes post-starvation . this class contains the secreted acid-phosphatase, pho1+ , spbc8e <dig> c , and spbc <dig>  . as pho1+ and spbc8e <dig> c induction has been previously observed in response to pi starvation  <cit> , we believe that this set accurately reflects the genes that respond rapidly to changes in external pi. in contrast, the slower response  was significantly enriched for genes previously implicated in a generalized stress response  <cit> . we focused our attention on the fast responding genes to avoid indirect effects caused by persistent stress in cells.

previous work indicated that pho7+ and csk1+ are important regulators of pho1+ expression  <cit> ; we expected that they would also play a significant role in regulating additional components of the pho response. to test our hypothesis, we probed the transcriptional profiles of wild-type, pho7Δ, csk1Δ, and pho7Δcsk1Δ strains in high-pi and no-pi conditions at  <dig> minutes post-starvation using dna hybridization microarrays.

we identified  <dig> genes induced in response to pi limitation . if expression of these genes is dependent on the activity of pho7+, then their transcript abundance should decrease in a pho7Δ strain when compared to a wild-type background . induction of  <dig> %  of these genes during pi starvation is pho7+ dependent . if the repressor  prevents this induction by pho7+ in high-pi conditions, then transcript abundance in a csk1Δ strain compared to the csk1+ background in high-pi conditions should increase. three genes display this response . a complete listing of all genes regulated by pi, pho7+, and/or csk1+, along with their orthologs in s. cerevisiae can be found in additional file  <dig>  finally, comparisons of the pho7Δ, csk1Δ, and pho7Δcsk1Δ double deletion strains confirm the previously described epistatic relationship between pho7+ and csk1+  .

when phosphate is limiting, s. cerevisiae pho <dig>  along with pho <dig>  induces the transcription of genes required for phosphate acquisition  <cit> . the orthologs of pho <dig>  pho <dig>  pho <dig>  and pho <dig> are not found in s. pombe or involved in the pho response, raising the question: does a functionally analogous signaling pathway involving pho7+ and csk1+ regulate the pho transcriptional response in s. pombe? comparing the pho <dig>  pi-starvation induced genes in s. cerevisiae <cit>  with the pho7+, pi-starvation induced genes in s. pombe reveals an overlap of only three orthologs . for pho1+, spbc8e <dig> c, and spbc <dig>  a similar system of transcription factor activation, with repression by a kinase in high-pi conditions, occurs. unlike pho85-pho <dig> regulation of pho <dig> in s. cerevisiae, most of the pho7+-mediated response is independent of csk1+ regulation. further, a large segment  of the observed s. pombe pho response is not conserved between s. pombe and s. cerevisiae. therefore, the primary role for pho7+ and csk1+ in the pho pathway is regulating the core set of phosphate harvesting and transport genes .

pho <dig> is enriched at the pho core promoters during pi starvation
pho <dig> is classified as a putative transcription factor because it possesses a zn2cys <dig> binuclear cluster , a dna binding domain for a number of transcription factors  <cit> . to test if pho <dig> binds to pho7+-regulated promoters, cells containing a functional, epitope tagged version of pho <dig>  were grown in high-pi or no-pi medium and purified dna associated with pho <dig> was processed via high-throughput sequencing .

surprisingly, there is widespread pho <dig> binding even in high-pi conditions  . during pi starvation  <dig> pho7-bound sites exhibit an increase in pho <dig> enrichment. the highest levels of enrichment were observed in the promoters of pho7-regulated genes identified in the microarray analysis . further, there is a distinct overlap between genes whose expression levels are regulated by pi and/or pho7+ and those whose promoters display enrichment in pho <dig> binding.  <dig> of the  <dig> pi dependent genes ,  <dig> of the  <dig> pho7+ dependent genes , and  <dig> of the  <dig> genes regulated by both pi and pho7+  have promoters that are enriched for pho <dig> binding in no-pi medium . these results are very different from the global binding profile of pho <dig> in s. cerevisiae. in that system, pho <dig> is only recruited to the promoters of pho regulated genes during phosphate starvation and, even then, only to relatively few locations  within the genome  <cit> .

pho <dig> binding is significantly enriched in the promoters of pho1+, spbc8e <dig> c, spbc <dig> , spac9e <dig> c, spbpb2b <dig> , and spcc <dig> c in no-pi conditions . in the case of pho1+, spbc8e <dig> c, spac9e <dig> c, and spbpb2b <dig>  there is enrichment of pho <dig> even in high-pi conditions . this explains the previously noted basal expression of pho1+ in s. pombe <cit>  – it appears that pho <dig> is bound and activating transcription even in the absence of stress . based on our microarray results, we note that increased pho <dig> enrichment during pi starvation is not due to an increase in pho7+ transcript abundance . moreover, we observe no significant difference in pho7-tap protein levels during pi starvation . together these observations suggest that the enrichment of pho <dig> in the promoters of pho7-regulated genes is attributable to increased affinity for the promoter and not due to an increase in pho <dig> abundance. further, the number of distinct pho <dig> binding events varies between different promoters , and we do not observe a clear correlation between the number of binding events and transcriptional up-regulation. our attempts to identify a dna binding motif for pho <dig> based solely on our chip-seq data were unsuccessful .

csk <dig> does not regulate pho <dig> promoter occupancy
motivated by the following observations, we studied what effect loss of csk <dig> would have on pho <dig> enrichment in high-pi conditions:  csk <dig> represses the expression of the core pho genes  in high-pi medium ; and  a decrease in pi results in enrichment of pho <dig> at the core pho promoters . if binding of pho <dig> to the pho promoters is necessary to drive increased transcriptional output, and csk <dig> represses transcription by preventing pho <dig> binding, then a loss of csk <dig> in high-pi conditions should result in an increase in pho <dig> binding . pho <dig> binding at the pho1+ promoter in a csk1Δ background is mildly increased compared to a csk1+ background . this increase in binding is less than the observed increase in pho <dig> binding in csk1+ cells grown in no- vs. high-pi conditions , suggesting that csk <dig> is not the major regulator of pho <dig> binding at the pho1+ promoter.

we then examined the global effect of csk <dig> loss on the binding profile of pho <dig> using chip-seq with csk1Δ cells grown in high-pi conditions. unlike the enrichment during pi starvation, deletion of csk <dig> does not result in a global increase in pho <dig> binding in high-pi conditions . at the core pho responsive genes we observe either no change  or a slight increase in pho <dig> binding in the csk1Δ strain , which is still well below the enrichment seen during pi starvation . as we observed during pi starvation, the loss of csk <dig> does not influence either pho7+ transcript abundance  or pho7-tap protein levels . we draw two conclusions from these data:  the level of pho <dig> bound in high-pi conditions would be sufficient to induce high levels of transcription if not for the repressive action of csk1; and  csk <dig> does not repress pho <dig> activity by preventing pho <dig> from binding to the promoters of responsive genes.

a pho <dig> upstream activating sequence  and an independent pi sensing module control pho1+ expression
based on our chip-seq results, we know pho <dig> binds between nucleotides - <dig> and - <dig> in the pho1+ promoter. to determine whether the sequences in this region are necessary and/or sufficient for pho7-dependent, pi-starvation induced expression, we utilized an in vivo strategy for confirming pho7-promoter interactions using exogenous expression plasmids. briefly, differing lengths of the pho1+ promoter driving the expression of yellow fluorescent protein  were constructed in a vector and transformed into pho7+, pho7Δ, and csk1Δ backgrounds . yfp+ expression was measured using facs with mean yfp intensity serving as a proxy for promoter activity . the  <dig> kb segment of the pho1+ promoter activates yfp+ expression during pi-starvation - it exhibits a ~7-fold increase in yfp intensity upon starvation . this induction is dependent on pho <dig>  as it is abolished in a pho7Δ background . surprisingly, we find that loss of csk <dig> does not result in high-levels of yfp+ expression with the  <dig> kb reporter in csk1Δ cells grown in either high-pi or no-pi growth media. while the levels of expression are above those seen in pho7+ cells grown in high-pi conditions and pho7Δ cells grown in any condition, they are significantly lower than the levels observed in a pho7+ background in no-pi conditions . based on our evidence that trimming the pho1+ promoter beyond  <dig> kb results in high level, constitutive expression of yfp+ in csk1Δ cells , our results with the  <dig> kb fragment in the csk1Δ background might be complicated by:  an additional repressor element located between  <dig> kb and  <dig> bp in the pho1+ promoter; and/or  differences between the chromatin structure/promoter architecture of the endogenous pho1+ locus and the exogenous  <dig> kb pho1+pr-yfp+ vector that are influencing transcription in the csk1Δ cells. therefore, we focused on the behavior of the shorter construct  as a proxy for the interaction of csk <dig> at the region bound by pho7-tap in the pho1+ promoter.

if the pho1+ promoter sequence bound by pho7-tap in the chip-seq experiment is necessary for activation of pho1+ transcription during pi-starvation, then deletion of this region should result in a loss of yfp+ expression during pi-starvation. to test this hypothesis, we generated a construct in which the  <dig> bp centered under the pho7-tap chip-seq signal were deleted . in high-pi growth conditions, the loss of the pho <dig> bound region results in a slight increase in yfp+ expression , and in pi-starvation this uasΔ pho1+pr-yfp+ construct no longer fully activates yfp+ expression . the loss of pho7+ results in a further decrease in expression from this uasΔ pho1+pr-yfp+ construct . it is possible that pho <dig> recognizes additional segments of the promoter, though such contributions to activation in pi-limiting conditions are modest. together these results demonstrate that the pho7-tap bound promoter element is necessary for pho7-dependent transcriptional activation during pi-limitation. we have termed this region the pho <dig> upstream activating sequence .

to test whether the pho <dig> uas is sufficient for pho7-dependent, pi-limitation induced transcriptional activation we deleted all but the first  <dig> bp of the pho1+ promoter and assayed in vivo yfp+ expression . yfp+ expression from the  <dig> bp pho1+pr-yfp+ construct is elevated in high-pi conditions, and is only marginally activated during pi-starvation . expression from this construct is reduced in a pho7Δ background and is unaffected by pi limitation – thus, expression in high-pi conditions and the modest expression increase in pi-limiting conditions are dependent on pho <dig> . in each background tested, the mean yfp intensities from the  <dig> bp pho1+pr-yfp+ construct vary by less than  <dig>  fold between high-pi and no-pi conditions . this is in contrast to both yfp+ expression from the  <dig> kb pho1+pr-yfp+ construct and endogenous expression of pho1+ during pi-starvation which exhibit >10-fold induction in pi limitation. thus, the pho <dig> uas is necessary but not sufficient for pho7-dependent transcriptional activation during pi-starvation.

interestingly, the  <dig> bp pho1+pr-yfp+ construct is capable of inducing full yfp+ expression in no-pi conditions in a csk1Δ background . however, the  <dig> bp pho1+pr-yfp+ construct is not capable of relieving csk <dig> repression in pi-starvation conditions – expression is not induced in response to pi limitation. trimming beyond the pho <dig> uas results in transcriptionally inactive promoters in all backgrounds tested . we conclude that there must be promoter elements present in the region between - <dig> kb and - <dig> bp in the pho1+ promoter that act as a pi-sensor:  preventing partial pho7-dependent activation in high-pi conditions; and  are important for csk <dig> de-repression during pi-starvation.

our facs and chip-seq results lead us to the following model for pho <dig> and csk <dig> regulation at the pho1+ promoter. in high-pi conditions some pho <dig> is bound to the uas in the pho1+ promoter. pho <dig> in this state drives basal expression of pho1+. csk <dig>  through an interaction with either pho <dig> or elements near the uas , prevents the full activation of pho1+ expression. the upstream pi-sensor in the promoter ensures that csk <dig> remains repressive in these conditions through an as yet unspecified mechanism. during pi starvation, csk <dig> repression is relieved and additional pho <dig> is recruited to the pho1+ promoter, driving maximal expression . investigating the promoter elements and transcription factors that comprise the pi-sensor – as well as the use of this promoter structure at additional pho7-dependent and pi-starvation inducible promoters – is an exciting area for future research.

pho <dig> regulates gene expression in response to multiple stress conditions
during our expression analysis we noticed a set of genes with decreased expression in high phosphate conditions in a pho7Δ background that are not induced during phosphate starvation . additionally, pho <dig> is bound to the promoters of a number of these genes in the chip-seq analysis . these observations raise the following question: is pho <dig> dedicated solely to the phosphate starvation pathway, like pho <dig>  or does it play a broader role in the stress response?

to answer this question, we identified the genes from our microarray analysis that display an increase in expression between the wild-type and pho7Δ backgrounds  and asked whether their promoters contained a significant peak of bound pho <dig> within  <dig> bp of the start codon – there are  <dig> genes that meet these requirements. this gene set was then processed through the gene ontology tools: term enrichment algorithm  <cit> , allowing us to look for biological functions over-represented in our gene set. for a go term to be considered enriched, we required at least three unique gene products be included in the term family and the enrichment must have a p-value ≤  <dig> .  <dig> of the original  <dig> genes meet these requirements and are classified by the highest parent term available .  <dig> of these  <dig> genes are involved in transmembrane transport, including  <dig> involved in phosphate ion transport. characterizing the transmembrane category in further depth we find genes involved in iron, copper, and zinc transport . a complete listing of go terms and the enriched gene set can be found in additional file  <dig> 

from the  <dig> identified genes, we utilized gpd1+, hxk2+, fio1+, and ctr4+ expression as proxies for pho7-mediated transcriptional induction in various stress conditions. gpd <dig> is a glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase that synthesizes glycerol and is essential for survival during osmotic stress  <cit> . during osmotic stress, glycerol pools increase, protecting the cell. hxk <dig> is a hexokinase that plays a role in regulating alternative carbon utilization when glucose sources are limited  <cit> . it is maximally induced in response to a switch from glucose to glycerol as a carbon source. fio <dig>  in conjunction with fip <dig>  comprises the oxidase-permease iron transport system responsible for harvesting iron in depleted conditions  <cit> . during iron repletion fio1+ is repressed by the activity of fep <dig>  an iron sensing transcription factor  <cit> . during iron starvation fio1+ is de-repressed and induced ~70-fold. finally, ctr <dig> is a high-affinity copper transporter that is induced in copper depletion conditions by cuf <dig>  a copper sensing transcription factor  <cit> . we designed rt-qpcr primer sets for each of these genes and measured their expression as a function of osmotic, iron, copper, and carbon utilization stress in both pho7+ and pho7Δ backgrounds .

as previously demonstrated  <cit> , loss of pho <dig> completely abrogates induction of pho1+ in no-pi medium . for each of the additional stresses tested, the loss of pho <dig> causes a significant decrease  in the maximal induction of the target gene . the pho <dig> dependence of these genes varies, with some  showing a relatively minor pho <dig> component, while others  appear fully dependent on pho <dig> to reach a peak level of induction in stress. none of the pho7-regulated responses were as dramatic as that observed for pi starvation, which may indicate that pho <dig> plays a more subtle role in coordinating expression at pi-independent loci. given this subtle response, the only recent availability of a deletion collection for s. pombe <cit> , and the fact that pho <dig> function was unverified until recently, it is not surprising that the more general role for pho <dig> has not been previously observed.

it remains possible that the stress response effects we observe are artifacts limited to only the few genes we studied using rt-qpcr. using microarray analysis with rna collected from pho7+ or pho7Δ cells grown in non-stress and stress conditions, we examined the stress response mediated by pho7+ in the above conditions. we find that of  <dig> genes induced in the stress conditions studied,  <dig> genes are pho7+ dependent  . pho7+ is responsible for coordinating between  <dig> - <dig> % of the total stress response in each condition . in each stress we find enrichment of distinct go terms. the set of iron-responsive, pho7+-regulated genes is significantly enriched for the biological process of iron assimilation , the set of copper-responsive, pho7+-regulated genes is enriched for copper ion transport , and the osmotic shock-responsive, pho7+-regulated gene set is enriched for metal ion transport . with the carbon switch, pho7+-regulated response we see an enrichment of genes responsible for small molecule metabolism as well as conjugation. the reasoning for the conjugation process enrichment or why pho7+ would be involved is unclear. overall, the biological processes are generally linked with transmembrane transport, suggesting that pho7+ is responsible for coordinating the correct transport of nutrients required for each stress response. unlike the system in s. cerevisiae, where the central pi-starvation regulator is tightly linked with the pho response, the pho7+ based system in s. pombe functions differentially in a number of stress response networks.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have defined and characterized the gene regulatory network in s. pombe responsible for coordinating the response to inorganic phosphate starvation. there are two distinct temporal responses in the pho pathway in s. pombe: a fast response concerned with immediately harvesting inorganic phosphate from the environment and transporting it into the cell, and a slower one associated with a general stress response. within the fast response we define a core pho regulon comprised of the pho1+, spbc8e <dig> c, and spbc <dig>  genes whose induction in response to phosphate starvation, and regulatory behavior, has been conserved between s. pombe and s. cerevisiae.

unlike the pho response in s. cerevisiae, however, the positive regulator in s. pombe is bound to the pho1+ and spbc8e <dig> c promoters irrespective of external phosphate availability. using our pho7-tap chip-seq dataset, we identified a single pho <dig> binding region in the pho1+ promoter. this region – located between nucleotides - <dig> and - <dig> – serves as a pho7-dependent uas, which is necessary for transcriptional activation of pho1+. the interaction of pho <dig> with the uas leads to a basal expression of the secreted acid phosphatase in high-pi conditions. the  <dig>  kb region preceding the uas in the pho1+ promoter is required for pi sensing, coordinating the activation by pho <dig> and repression by csk <dig> based on pi availability. csk <dig> prevents full activation of pho <dig> during phosphate replete conditions and repression is maintained even in the minimal uas construct . during phosphate starvation this inhibition is relieved  and additional pho <dig> is recruited to a number of sites throughout the genome, causing further induction of pho7+-dependent genes . in previous work, csk <dig> was shown to regulate transcription by activating the positive transcription elongation factor b  ortholog, cdk <dig>  <cit> . cdk <dig> coordinates transcript elongation and processing, and its full activation by csk <dig> leads to an increase in ctd kinase activity  <cit> . how this generally positive regulatory network is switched to an inhibitory role in the pho system remains an open question.

we were also surprised to find that pho <dig> was bound throughout the genome in both high-pi and no-pi conditions. we had thought based on previous evidence that pho <dig>  like pho <dig>  would be specific to the pho response. instead we demonstrate that pho <dig> binds within the promoters of additional stress responsive genes and plays a role in iron, copper, osmotic, and alternative carbon utilization stress. each stressor elicits a different pho7+-dependent transcriptional response, though it appears that the main regulatory role of pho7+ is coordinating stress-specific transmembrane transport. there must exist some mechanism to either direct pho <dig> to the proper location for inducing the correct genes or activate pho <dig> at only the appropriate locations . in s. cerevisiae, the osmotic, oxidative, and glucose limitation stress responses are mediated by the transcription factor msn <dig>  <cit> . in normal conditions, msn <dig> is phosphorylated and its entry into the nucleus is limited  <cit> . different stresses elicit distinct dynamics of nuclear transport, leading to different transcriptional outputs  <cit> . given that pho <dig> is bound to the genome constitutively, we do not expect that nuclear exclusion will play as large a role as it does with msn <dig> regulation, but it remains possible that differential post-translational modifications are responsible for this combinatorial activation by pho <dig>  pho <dig> may be playing a more passive role in regulation, with additional factors determining pho <dig> genomic localization.

nonetheless, we have demonstrated that within the evolutionary parallel signal transduction networks that comprise the pho pathway there exists a core pho transcriptional regulon. the specific mechanisms involved in regulating the pho response in s. cerevisiae and s. pombe show remarkable flexibility. an interesting area for future research centers on the environmental factors that contributed to the development of these two parallel networks. why is the pho response in s. pombe under the control of a general stress transcription factor, pho <dig>  while s. cerevisiae has developed the phosphate starvation specific pathway for pho <dig> activation? what are the environmental pressures that favor a “leaky” response in s. pombe and a tightly controlled one in s. cerevisiae? broadly speaking, our study provides a framework for determining the fundamental requirements for regulating phosphate homeostasis in ascomycota and the specific points in the signal transduction pathway that can be altered as conditions merit.
