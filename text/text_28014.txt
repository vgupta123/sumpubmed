BACKGROUND
the growth rate of corpora lutea  immediately after ovulation is 4- to 20-fold more intense than that of some of the most malignant human tumours and is sustained by the formation of new blood vessels from capillaries of the theca interna compartment  <cit> . actually, 85% of the dividing cells in the primate corpus luteum during the early luteal phase are endothelial cells  <cit> . the duration of this intense angiogenic phase in the corpus luteum varies among species, but appears to be completed by day  <dig> of the luteal phase in primates when capillaries surround almost all luteal cells and capillary dilation is evident  <cit> . vascular endothelial growth factor  effect on endothelial cells mitosis and differentiation is considered fundamental in vascular bed development. we have previously determined the ability of swine granulosa and theca cells of growing follicles as well as luteal cells to produce vegf  <cit> .

after the stimulation of endothelial cells mitosis for neovascular tubes development, the remodelling of extracellular matrix is necessary and different proteolytic enzymes are involved  <cit> . the extracellular matrix  has become recognized as a key regulatory component in cellular physiology, providing an environment for cell migration, division, differentiation, anchorage, and in some cases, an ultimate fate between cell survival or cell death  <cit> . the highly regulated control of ecm turnover and homeostasis occurs, in part, by the action of a specific class of proteolytic enzymes known as the matrix metalloproteinases . the mmps and their associated endogenous inhibitors act in concert to control aspects of reproductive function. in the ovary and uterus, the mmp system has been postulated to regulate all the dynamic structural changes that occur throughout the oestrous cycle  <cit> .

to allow repeated opportunities of fertilization, the duration of cl life is rigorously programmed, in fact, after a first period of rapid growth the tissue becomes stably organized and prepares to switch to the phenotype required for its next apoptotic regression  <cit> . five to ten grams of luteal tissue growth and disappear at each ovarian cycle .

the switch between growth and regression is mainly regulated by lh  and pgf2α  and their receptors balance as well as by cytokines, growth factors, apoptosis/oncogenes related factors and plasminogen activator/matrix metalloproteinase activators and inhibitors  <cit> . if fertilization has not occurred, or implantation was unsuccessful, or the pregnancy ends, luteolysis is initiated whereby the cl rapidly loses its progesterone-producing ability followed by degradation of luteal tissue  <cit> . luteal regression is thought to occur through apoptotic  <cit>  and proteolytic  <cit>  mechanisms; however, the molecular mechanisms underlining this event are not well characterized  <cit> . apoptosis requires a wide extracellular matrix remodelling  <cit>  as well as the action of a ca++/mg++-dependent endonuclease, that is developmentally regulated in rat luteal cell nuclei  <cit> , leading to the degradation of genomic dna into discrete oligonucleosome fragments. therefore angiogenesis and apoptosis and their regulation in the cl play a fundamental role in the maintenance of reproductive performances. furthermore, the ovary is the unique organ where strictly regulated tissue hyperplasia and regression take place in a cyclic manner under physiological conditions.

this study was aimed at characterizing the temporal expression pattern of vegf, mmp- <dig>  mmp- <dig> and ca++/mg++-dependent endonuclease throughout the lifespan of swine cl and investigating whether the expression levels of those molecules are related to cl functional stage.

RESULTS
cl functional stage assessment
both luteal progesterone  concentration and prostaglandin f2α receptor  mrna expression followed typical swine luteal phase patterns. p <dig> concentrations increased gradually during the formation of cl, reaching the highest level during the mid-late phase , and then declined significantly on day  <dig> . similarly, fpr mrna levels increased gradually to a greater extent on day  <dig> . at pregnancy, high levels of p <dig> and fpr mrna  were observed.

dnase activity assay
a regulated ca++/mg++-dependent endonuclease expression and activity were detected in swine cl. fig 2a illustrates the ca++/mg++-dependent endonuclease activity found in luteal nuclei obtained at days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  a marked activity was obtained with both ca++ and mg++ whereas the addition of zn++ inhibited almost completely the enzyme activity.

the amount of activable dnase gradually increased during the oestrous cycle, maintaining high at pregnancy. moreover, a high level of spontaneous apoptosis in the control group  at day  <dig> was also observed .

vegf content
both vegf mrna and protein presented similar patterns of expression throughout the oestrous cycle. the highest values of vegf were observed immediately after ovulation, decreasing significantly at day  <dig>  and remaining unchanged during the mid-luteal phase. at day  <dig>  a second significant drop was observed. at pregnancy vegf mrna and protein levels were intermediate between those of day  <dig> and  <dig> .

mmps activity assay
three distinct bands of gelatinase activity corresponding to latent mmp- <dig> , latent mmp- <dig>  and active mmp- <dig>  were evidenced in the swine cl . gelatinolytic activities for both latent and active forms of mmp- <dig> were considered together for the analysis. the activities of mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> changed over the luteal phase. constant levels of mmp- <dig> activity were observed during cl formation, increasing significantly in late  luteal phase . in contrast, mmp- <dig> activity peaked in the early  and late  luteal phase, showing the lowest values in the midluteal phase . at pregnancy, basal levels of mmp- <dig> and high levels of mmp- <dig> were observed.

discussion
the cl is a transient endocrine gland, which is formed from the remnants of an ovulated follicle  <cit> . during this process, a capillary network invades from the theca tissues into the granulosa layers through a dynamic angiogenesis process such that after its formation, the cl is one of the most vascularised organs in the body  <cit> . during vegf driven angiogenesis, microvascular endothelial cells produce gelatinases , which breach the perivascular basement membrane and allow endothelial cells to migrate outward through the extracellular space  <cit> . mmps are also involved, together with ca++/mg++-dependent endonuclease, in apoptotic tissue remodelling at luteolysis.

in this study, proteases with gelatinolytic activity that is consistent with mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> family members  <cit>  were identified in cl collected during the oestrous cycle and at pregnancy. the gradual increase of fpr mrna expression, peaking on day  <dig>  together with the accumulation of ca++/mg++-dependent endonuclease, confirms the competence acquired by the luteal tissue around this moment to rapidly react to pgf2α and to initiate the regression. these characteristics are maintained in the pregnant cl which is always sensible to pgf2α. moreover, elevated concentrations of p <dig> at day  <dig> corroborate the cl ability to sustain an eventual pregnancy.

members of mmp-system may be involved in several of the proteolytic events that take place in the ovary during the reproductive cycle  <cit> . mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> have previously been detected by zymography in homogenates of rat ovaries  <cit> , and in cl of bovine  <cit> , human  <cit> , primates  <cit> , mouse  <cit> , ovine  <cit>  and swine  <cit> . the main role proposed for mmps concerns the tissue remodelling associated to luteolysis.

our findings demonstrated the presence of mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> in the corpus luteum during different ovarian phases. mmp- <dig> activity was basal during early-mid luteal phase and at pregnancy while was maximal during luteolysis. mmp- <dig> plays a role in various tissue remodelling processes, including trophoblast invasion  <cit>  and tumour cell motility  <cit> . however, a persistence of mmp- <dig> activity throughout the cl formation supports suggestions that tissue remodelling continues throughout cl development and maintenance.

concerning mmp- <dig> activity, high levels were observed during early luteal phase, luteolysis and pregnancy. mmp- <dig> is probably involved in the extensive tissue remodelling that occurs during cl formation, when extracellular material, composed primarily of follicular elements that represent a basement membrane-type ecm, is removed  <cit> . this clearance may create a more hospitable or spacious environment for the subsequent rapid proliferation and intermingling of luteal cells  <cit>  and development of luteal ecm  <cit> . this hypothesis is supported by the findings that it is the primary metalloproteinase detected in follicles explants  <cit> . in addition, mmp- <dig> is the major mmp secreted into the culture medium of luteinised bovine  <cit>  and human granulosa cells  <cit> .

a different activity profiles for both mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> were also observed in human  <cit>  and bovine  <cit>  corpus luteum. in the porcine cl, mrna expression for mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> was low during early luteal period , increasing significantly during midluteal period , and reaching the highest values during the late luteal period   <cit> . these results agree well with ours, considering that the authors did not studied the earliest period of oestrous cycle , period in which we verified major alterations of mmp- <dig> activity.

in the early luteal phase, we also detected the highest levels of vegf. as expected, vegf mrna and protein were detected during all days of the oestrous cycle and showed similar pattern of expression. high levels were verified immediately after ovulation, concomitantly with the intense luteal vascular growth and cl formation. thus supporting the role of vegf in the angiogenesis of the newly formed cl. changes of vegf levels in cl during the oestrous cycle have been reported also in other species  <cit> . those reports, in accord with our results, demonstrate that the highest vegf mrna expression and vegf protein concentration are detected during the early luteal phase, and are followed by a significant decrease of expression during the mid and late luteal phases.

taken together, our results provide that in addition to intense angiogenesis , elevated luteal gelatinases may contribute to the extensive luteal ecm and tissue remodelling that occurs as the postovulatory follicle is transformed into the cl  <cit> . many studies relative to neoplastic growth well describe the interplay between vegf and mmps  <cit> . bergers et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that mmp <dig> is able to mobilize matrix attached vegf isoforms and this action results essential for the switch between vascular quiescence to angiogenesis during carcinogenesis. another study showed that vegf regulated ovarian cancer invasion through secretion and activation of mmps  <cit> .

after the cl is fully formed, steroidogenesis is maximal during the midluteal period, and mmp activity and vegf concentration are at basal levels. interestingly, we previously reported an increased expression of the less abundant and matrix-attached vegf splice variants  as well as of the two vegf receptors in this moment  <cit> . in this phase, luteal tissue prepares itself to the next step cumulating high levels of fpr and endonuclease making the tissue very sensitive to luteolytic stimulus. with the onset of structural regression, the mmps are again called into action for the remodelling and removal of the cl  <cit> .

the elevated expression of vegf associated to the presence of mmp- <dig> at pregnancy suggests that initial angiogenic process during the early luteal phase may be renewed in swine pregnant cl. increased angiogenesis at pregnancy in luteal tissue is controversial. wulff et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that luteal rescue is associated with a second wave of angiogenesis in human cl, while rowe et al.  <cit>  stated that no pregnancy-induced angiogenesis take place in marmoset cls. certainly, a stable and efficient vascular bed are required for the endocrine function of pregnant cl. pauli et al.  <cit>  reported that the administration of anti-vegfr- <dig> antibody during the pre- and post-implantation periods in rodents, disrupted maternal ovarian function eliminating pre-existing luteal blood vessels. thus, vegf/vegfr- <dig> pathway is critical to maintain the functionality of luteal blood vessels during pregnancy and might also be involved in regulating vascular permeability and p <dig> release into the bloodstream  <cit> . therefore, the increase in vegf at pregnancy is not unexpected but the increase in mmp- <dig> needs further clarifications. the different profile of vegf/mmp- <dig> expression observed between fully formed  and pregnant cls should be taken into account when physiological effects will be monitored.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that cl development and regression is a very useful model for studying vegf/mmps relationships. during the very early luteal phase, high mmps activities coupled with high vegf levels drive the tissue to an "angiogenic phenotype", allowing cl growth under lh stimulus. in the late luteal phase, low vegf and elevated mmps levels may play role in the apoptotic tissue and ecm remodelling during structural luteolysis.
