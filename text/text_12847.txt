BACKGROUND
diarrhoea is a common problem in neonatal foals. almost all foals develop transient diarrhoea within the first weeks of life  <cit> . studies have reported different viral, bacterial, and parasitic causes . between the days  <dig> and  <dig> of a foal’s life, when the dam’s first post partum oestrus is expected, diarrhoea in foals is observed frequently  <cit> . the diarrhoea is termed ‘foal heat diarrhoea’. although commonly there is no reduction in behaviour of the foals, some of them suffer from diarrhoea more than 20 days within the first 2 months of life and develop not as good as foals with shorter diarrhoea periods. the establishment of intestinal microflora and maturation of the gastrointestinal mucosa are some reasons proposed for diarrhoea in this period of life  <cit> . however, little is known about the development of the intestinal microflora during this period. during and following birth, neonates are exposed to a variety of microorganisms originally from the dam or environment. on the day of birth, aerobes, facultative anaerobes, and strict anaerobes were already detected in the faeces of the foals  <cit> . before foals are fed solid food, cellulolytic bacteria have already colonized the digestive tract  <cit> . because the intestinal microflora is a crucial line of resistance against colonization by exogenous microbes, it is highly relevant in the prevention of tissue invasion by pathogens  <cit> .

probiotic bacteria were defined by a joint fao, who  <cit>  as ‘live microorganism which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host’. some probiotics are known to have a positive effect on the intestinal microflora. for example, yuyama et al.  <cit>  reported that supplementation with probiotics led to an earlier recovery from foal heat diarrhoea, probably by enhancing establishment of the normal intestinal microflora. however, other studies that showed that supplementation with probiotics in foals increased the occurrence and duration of diarrhoea compared to placebo-treated foals  <cit> , and weese and rousseau  <cit>  reported that probiotic administration was significantly associated with development of signs of depression, anorexia, and colic in foals.

the aim of the study was to investigate the effects of oral probiotic supplementation on the growing intestinal microflora in equine neonates. previous studies have shown positive effects of bacillus cereus var. toyoi on intestinal health in calves, piglets, poultry, broiler chickens, and growing rabbits . baum et al.  <cit>  observed trophic effects of bacillus cereus var. toyoi on the small intestinal mucosa of pigs as demonstrated by longer villi, thicker mucosa and more mature, i.e. acidic mucins. vilà et al.  <cit>  showed that feeding of bacillus cereus var. toyoi reduced the prevalence of pathogens such as salmonella in poultry and improved the performance variables of broiler chickens. we hypothesized that oral supplementation with b. cereus var. toyoi from birth until 2 months of the foal’s life would modify the intestinal microflora and mucosa, and therefore lead to a reduction of diarrhoea in foals.

RESULTS
during the observation period, haematolgy parameters like erythrocytes, haematocrit or leukocytes were in the reference range obtained for foals . 24 h after birth serum igg levels were always higher than the lowest critical threshold of 8 g/l. serum igg levels of the foals were in median between  <dig>  g/l and  <dig>  g/l . during the observation period, serum igg levels decreased down to  <dig> – 70% of initial value at day  <dig> . diarrhoea occurred in up to 90% of the foals for at least one 1 day between days  <dig> and  <dig> of life. in particular, during transition period between orange-brown milk faeces and more adult-like greenish faeces a loose consistency  was observed in 92% of the foals. despite this, foals remained bright and alert and continued to nurse.

supplementation with b. cereus var. toyoi had no significant effect on dry matter content of the faeces of the foals. furthermore, supplementation with b. cereus var. toyoi had no significant effect on blood parameters and there was no change in the incidence of diarrhoea in foals in the first 58 days of life .table  <dig>

discussion
the present study was performed on a studfarm under typical field conditions. to minimize effects related to husbandry, feeding, and season, our study took place at one thoroughbred farm, within one foaling period from february to may. according to lahrssen and zentek  <cit>  such a study design is important when working with a limited number of animals. probiotic dosing and treatment period were in accordance with studies by jeroch et al.  <cit> , jadamus et al.  <cit> , and vilà et al.  <cit> .

unfortunately some foals were treated with antibiotics during a severe period of illness which may have an impact on the subsequent microbial profile in faeces.

bacterial microflora in faeces was used as an indication of the effects of b. cereus var. toyoi on the intestinal health of foals. although faeces might have some limitations for describing the gut ecosystem, by comparing microflora and the digestion process in the colon with faeces in fistulated horses julliand and goachet  <cit>  showed that the faecal ecosystem is an appropriate marker of intestinal changes appearing in the colon ecosystem.

culture-plate methods were used to access bacterial microflora in the faeces of the foals to establish basic knowledge. for following studies culture-dependent methods should be extended by pcr methods to improve knowledge about diversity of genes.

in our study, diarrhoea did not lead to changes in normal foal behaviour. foals remained bright and alert and continued to nurse. clinical parameters including heart and respiratory rate, body temperature, and body weight were in the proper physiological range. we conclude that diarrhoea in foals between days  <dig> and  <dig> of the foal’s life is not primarily pathogen related. during this period, we observed diarrhoea when orange-brownish faeces changed to green, soft faeces. these changes in faeces colour might mark the transition from only digestion of milk to increasing digestion of solid nutrients like crude fibre. in that context, hemicellulose and cellulose could be responsible for a higher water-binding capacity and a reduction of intestinal passage. as a result, adsorptive and secretory intestinal processes are influenced and free water in the colon could simulate lower dry matter content in faeces of the foals. another reason for the reduction of dry matter content in faeces could be osmotically-acting metabolites of bacterial digestion of crude fibre.

meconium has been reported to be free of bacteria  <cit>  and no bacterial pcr products were obtained from meconium samples  <cit> , which confirmed that the gastrointestinal tract of a foetus is sterile  <cit> . in mares, bacterial flora remained largely stable from 14 days before until 42 days after foaling, whereas the presence of bacterial species and intensity of bacterial growth changed over time in foals  <cit> . these results were confirmed in our study, as aerobic and anaerobic bacteria , but also lactobacilli, enterococci and c. perfringens counts in the faeces of the foals increased after birth until day  <dig> or day  <dig>  foals start to consume forages and concentrates very early in life. as a result, the intestinal microflora is adapting rapidly to improve digestion of the feed. in foals, there may be great genetic selective pressure for early colonisation of microflora to avoid acidic stomach conditions and to occupy a more distal region  than would be the case in calves or lambs  <cit> . by day  <dig> of a foal’s life, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, enterobacteria, lactobacilli, and enterococci had decreased to the levels in the faeces of mares . these changes seemed to be related to the stabilisation of microflora by increasing fibre intake and digestion processes within the first 2 months of the foal’s life.

bacillus cereus var. toyoi did not have any effects on the health status of the foals. there is a great diversity of bacteriophages, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa that might have an unselective entry to the gastrointestinal tract of the foals. therefore, even if probiotic bacteria survive the acidic conditions after day  <dig> of life, they will experience heavy competition within the very rapidly developing intestinal microflora of foals.

probiotic supplementation with lactobacillus pentosus we <dig> was significantly associated with development of signs of depression, anorexia, and colic in foals  <cit> . also, supplementation with lactobacillus rhamnosus and enterococcus faecium led to increased diarrhoea in foals  <cit> . in contrast, we found that supplementation with b. cereus var. toyoi had no effect on the growth and health parameters in foals kept under high-quality standard husbandry.

CONCLUSIONS
supplementation with b. cereus var. toyoi had no effect on health status or the intestinal microflora in suckling foals. diarrhoea occurred in up to 90% of the foals for at least one 1 day between days  <dig> and  <dig> of life. despite this, foals remained bright and alert and continued to nurse. diarrhoea might be a part of the normal physiological development of the intestinal microflora. competition with diverse, rapidly colonizing intestinal microflora seems to suppress b. cereus var. toyoi and its possible effects.
