BACKGROUND
the perchlorate ion has been found to contaminate ground and surface water, as well as food, vitamins, and drinking water  <cit> . perchlorate is known to inhibit the sodium-iodide symporter, which is responsible for the supply of iodine to the thyroid and to milk in the mammary glands  <cit> .

the environmentally stable perchlorate ion can be removed from contaminated water using ion-exchange in combination with a microbial treatment processes. during bacterial respiration perchlorate acts as an electron acceptor and requires the addition of an electron donor  <cit> . perchlorate is metabolized through a series of reductions to chlorite and then a dismutation to chloride and molecular oxygen  <cit> . in many cases, perchlorate is present in very low concentrations and must be treated to even lower levels, e.g., 6 ppb in california  <cit> , and 2 ppb in massachusetts  <cit> . this makes biological treatment very difficult as a stand-alone process since other electron acceptors such as nitrate and oxygen are often preferred.

ion-exchange processes have been used to remove perchlorate to meet the required treatment goals, but the perchlorate and other co-contaminant anions such as nitrate are merely transferred to a concentrated brine stream, which in turn must be treated  <cit> . the combination of ion-exchange to remove and concentrate the perchlorate from the contaminated water source and biological treatment to remove the perchlorate from the brine is an attractive option for drinking water treatment. since nitrate is often present with perchlorate and will also be concentrated in the ion-exchange brine, the biological system should also remove nitrate.

the cultures examined here were initially enriched from marine sediment in the year  <dig>  the culture designated as p <dig> has been maintained continuously in the laboratory in a defined 3% nacl saline medium with perchlorate and acetate as the sole electron acceptor and donor respectively in a  <dig>  l batch reactor  <cit> . in  <dig>  half of the p <dig> culture was transferred to a new reactor and fed with both nitrate and perchlorate as the electron acceptors and acetate as the sole electron donor. this culture was designated as np <dig>  the cultures have been used as the basis for many published studies over the last 10 years  <cit> .

in order to better understand these cultures, an initial characterization of the microbial populations was obtained by cloning 16s rdna genes and characterizing them by either dgge or 16s rdna sequencing  <cit> . in the work reported here, we further our understanding of the biota in these cultures by characterizing the total community dna of both the p <dig> and np <dig> cultures using illumina dna sequencing technology. this metagenome analysis is supplemented by sequencing the 16s rrna genes of several strains that have been isolated from the cultures and successfully cultivated in the laboratory. the combination of these two approaches provides new insight into the major and minor components of the cultures and their contribution to perchlorate and nitrate removal from contaminated water.

RESULTS
pure culture isolation
four pure strains were obtained using anaerobic incubations: nw  and ny , originated from np30; pw  and py , originated from p <dig>  another four pure strains were obtained from aerobically incubated plates and designated as nwo, nyo, pwo and pyo following the naming scheme for anaerobic isolates. when these new strains were transferred back into p medium, none of them could reduce perchlorate after 120 days’ incubation, although growth was observed. a single additional isolate that can reduce perchlorate was obtained from the np <dig> culture and characterized in detail as reported elsewhere  <cit> . this strain was identified as marinobacter sp. strain p4b <dig> a member of the alteromonadaceae. 16s rdna sequences were obtained for all the pure strains except the nw isolate, which produced heterogeneous sequencing patterns. table  <dig> presents a summary of the results obtained by comparing the sequences obtained for the pure cultures with those from the ncbi nt database. all belong to the phylum proteobacteria. two of the np <dig> strains were identified as members of the rhodobacteraceae closely related to stappia indica. the other was an azoarcus like isolate close to the members of a recently discovered and vaguely defined genus denitromonas . three of the five p <dig> isolates were identified as hyphomonas jannaschiana. the remaining p <dig> isolate was identified as a cellulomonas strain that belongs to the cellulomonadaceae and is closely related to the c. hominis type strain.table  <dig>

comparative metagenomic analysis
illumina sequencing of the two cultures yielded approximately  <dig>  million reads for p <dig> and  <dig>  million for np <dig>  table  <dig> summarizes the assembly of the metagenomic contigs. the data analysis strategy yielded converging estimates for the taxonomic composition of the p <dig> and np <dig> microbial communities at the family level and above . as shown in figure  <dig>  both mixed cultures were found to be dominated by alpha, beta, and gamma proteobacteria, while the proportion of other phyla is substantially lower. as shown in figure  <dig>  alphaproteobacteria from the family rhodobacteraceae constitute a prevailing taxonomic group in the p <dig> culture . the second most abundant fraction is formed by betaproteobacteria belonging to rhodocyclaceae, which is followed by gammaproteobacteria from families chromatiaceae, ectothiorhodospiraceae and pseudomonadaceae. in the np <dig> culture, figure  <dig>  the rhodobacteraceae have effectively completely disappeared and are now replaced by an expanding representation from the rhodocyclaceae and the emergence of the alteromonadaceae at a much lower but increasingly significant fraction of the community. other taxonomic groups found in the np <dig> community include gammaproteobacteria from the families pseudomonadaceae, ectothiorhodospiraceae and chromatiaceae and betaproteobacteria from families burkholderiaceae and comamonadaceae.table  <dig>

p <dig> culture
np <dig> culturethe relative abundance of members of the alpha, beta, and gamma proteobacter are shown in a pie chart with approximate percentages indicated. the dramatic decrease of the alphaproteobacter in the np <dig> culture and accompanying increase in the betaproteobacter is clearly illustrated.
relative abundance of major bacterial families in p <dig> and np <dig> communities. relative abundance was estimated using the contigeval analysis pipeline. height of the colored boxes represents a number of identities in all contigs assigned to a given taxon related to a number of identities in all contigs assigned to all taxa. the boxes are clustered by class. names associated with each color are provided that list class, order, and family. for each culture, only the most abundant families contributing to the 90% of cumulative percentage are shown. an alternative representation in which they are ordered by taxon abundance averaged for p <dig> and np <dig> cultures is provided as additional file  <dig> 



estimates of the p <dig> culture composition at the genus level vary depending on the employed data processing procedure. when the contigs were evaluated against ncbi nt nucleotide database , the highest scoring taxon was the genus ruegeria . however, when contig-derived protein sequences were searched against protein databases, the major portion of the hits was assigned to other members of the same family, either roseovarius or roseobacter. this discrepancy may reflect an influence of non-coding genomic sequences or codon usage pattern on the taxonomic assignment of the contigs. other highly represented genera included rhodobacter, dinoroseobacter and phaeobacter , azoarcus and thauera , burkholderia , pseudomonas , allochromatium  and thioalkalivibrio . while the abundance rank of the mentioned taxons depends on the contig binning method used, they can often be found among the top genera. the composition of the np <dig> culture exhibits less ambiguity. the most abundant genera are azoarcus and thauera. they are followed by marinobacter, pseudomonas and, in some reconstructions, the rhodocyclaceae genera azospira and dechloromonas. the alphaproteobacteria genera that dominate the p <dig> culture are remarkably absent in the np <dig> culture.

in addition to binning the metavelvet-assembled contigs by similarity search in global sequence databases, taxonomic composition of the perchlorate-degrading cultures was assessed by cataloging 16s rrna gene sequences extracted from metavelvet and oases assemblies of the metagenomic reads . the p <dig> culture featured 16s rdna signatures related to the alphaproteobacteria genus roseovarius , the betaproteobacteria genera azoarcus, azospira, thauera and rhodocyclus , the gammaproteobacteria genus marinobacter , and several gammaproteobacteria genera of unclear phylogenetic relatedness . in the np <dig> culture, 16s rdna sequences belonging to the rhodobacteraceae specifically and the alphaproteobacteria in general were not observed. the betaproteobacteria family rhodocyclaceae was represented by all the above-mentioned genera with the addition of the genus azonexus while the list of gammaproteobacteria was expanded by addition of the genus halomonas. the np <dig> culture also exhibited signatures of bacteroidetes and spirochaetes, which were not seen in the p <dig> culture.

searches of the metagenomic contigs for genes involved in perchlorate degradation revealed the presence of identical perchlorate reductase gene clusters, pcrabcd, and chlorite dismutase genes, cld, in both p <dig> and np <dig> cultures. the recovered perchlorate reductase sequence showed highest similarity to an enzyme from dechloromonas aromatica rcb, which is a member of the rhodocyclaceae family. there is 64% sequence identity between the molybdopterin-bearing catalytic subunits , 67% identity between the iron-sulfur subunits , and 47% identity between the cytochrome-type subunits . the closest homolog for the chlorite dismutase found in these cultures is the cld gene found in the betaproteobacterium ideonella dechloratans . in view of the negative effect of nitrate addition on the abundance of members of the rhodobacteraceae in the np <dig> culture, the metagenomic contigs were searched for genes encoding nitrate-metabolyzing enzymes . it was found that only a few of the functionally annotated p <dig> and np <dig> contigs with highest similarity to nitrate reductase genes are taxonomically affiliated with alphaproteobacteria taxa including the family rhodobacteraceae. on the other hand, the contigs similar to respiratory and dissimilatory nitrate reductase genes from beta- and gammaproteobacterial sources were observed in substantially larger numbers in both p <dig> and np <dig> communities. this observation points to a relatively low nitrate-metabolizing potential of the alphaproteobacteria fraction of the mixed cultures compared with that of the other taxonomic groups.table  <dig>

discussion
the stability of microbial populations and function of cultures used for industrial wastewater treatment is an important consideration. it is therefore important to understand what the key organisms are in the p <dig> and np <dig> cultures and ultimately how these populations are effected by changes in the feed brine. the ability to characterize and subsequently monitor culture composition is important for early recognition and treatment of undesirable changes. in this regard, the metagenomic characterization described here is much more informative than earlier methods such as dgge  <cit> . moreover, in light of ongoing advances in high throughput sequencing such as multiplexing and the use of paired end reads, the metagenomics approach is competitive in time and cost potentially allowing routine comprehensive monitoring of the communities at regular intervals in the future.

the communities examined here differ from those used in most other studies of perchlorate and nitrate reducing cultures due to their salt tolerance and longevity. they thus represent unique ecosystems. comparing the results obtained in this study with the earlier characterization obtained with dgge  <cit> , it is noticed that the diversity of the cultures has likely decreased with time. some of the prevailing genera of gammaproteobacteria, such as dechloromarinus in p <dig> and acholeplasma-like species of the phylum firmicutes in both p <dig> and np <dig> observed in  <dig>  <cit>  have effectively disappeared in the present study. this change was probably due to the high salt concentrations  occasionally fed to the two cultures, since similar changes were observed when the cultures were fed with ion-exchange brines  <cit> . the groups of rhodocyclaceae and rhodobacteraceae in p <dig> had been dominating since  <dig>  <cit>  and continue to dominate in this study . members of the gammaproteobateria  observed in the np <dig> culture in  <dig>  <cit>  are still observed in this study. however, their abundance decreased with members of the betaproteobacteria  making up the difference. this may be because of the increased perchlorate concentrations in the np <dig> feed that began in  <dig>  consistent with this interpretation is the observation that the genus denitromonas emerged to be an abundant member of the np <dig> community when the community was fed with only perchlorate for one month  <cit> . the very defined media fed to the cultures has likely helped to maintain the long-term stability of the cultures, although, the change of the relative ratio of major electron acceptors could greatly change the community. nevertheless, on the whole, given that the the p <dig> and np <dig> communities are almost exclusively comprised of alpha, beta, and gamma proteobacteria they are far less diverse than what is encountered in natural environments such as soils.

obtaining key organisms in pure culture will facilitate our understanding of the changes in biochemistry required to effectively utilize perchlorate in the presence or absence of nitrate in saline environments. in addition, such pure cultures could be used in practice to augment the mixed culture should the perchlorate-reducing bacteria be lost or diminished. the metagenomics approach has clarified the likely properties and known relatives of the key organisms in each culture. thus, to the extent individual organisms can be isolated from the p <dig> and np <dig> cultures, it is now possible to understand their significance in the context of the larger community.

further effort is needed to obtain a complete set of representative cultures. previously, a species of marinobacter, a member of the alteromonadaceae, was isolated from the np <dig> culture and found to utilize perchlorate in the presence of nitrate in saline environments  <cit> . the metagenomic results confirm that this organism is likely a significant part of the np <dig> community. in the present study, several additional isolates have been obtained from both cultures, but none degraded perchlorate.

an azoarcus like betaproteobacterium was isolated from the np <dig> culture. it belongs to the rhodocyclaceae that dominate the np <dig> culture and are highly represented in the p <dig> culture. on the other hand, hyphomonas sp. was not found in significant numbers in either culture in the metagenomic analysis. however, its distinct cellular morphology allowed it to be observed microscopically as a minor component of both cultures. the other two organisms obtained in pure culture, stappia sp. and cellulomonas sp., do not appear to be present in large amounts in either culture and may have been enriched from small numbers on the solid medium due to their ability to grow in low nutrient conditions. thus, the isolation of the pure cultures was seemingly influenced by an ability of individual strains to proliferate under selected cultivation conditions in the absence of other members of the microbial communities rather than by their abundance in the mixed cultures.

the marinobacter strain is the only isolate obtained to date that is capable of degrading perchlorate and nitrate simultaneously, although it prefers perchlorate as the electron acceptor  <cit> . in other studies, a marinobacter species was found as the dominant organism in hydrogenotrophic membrane biofilm reactors  treating ion-exchange brines containing perchlorate  <cit> . van ginkel et al.  <cit>  examined the microbial community in four h2-based mbfrs treating ion-exchange brines. four different inocula including np <dig> were used in that study. except the freshwater inoculum, the other three salt-tolerant inocula in the reactors resulted in similar consortia, with members of the gammaroteobacteria representing 95% and alphaproteobacteria representing 0-4% of the total 16s rrna gene clones. among them, marinobacter constituted 38-81% of the total clones. even in the freshwater inoculated mbfr, marinobacter represented 34% of the total clones. since the nitrate fed to np <dig> was more concentrated than perchlorate, marinobacter would have a competitive advantage over organisms that could only degrade perchlorate or preferred nitrate to perchlorate. its significant elevation in numbers in the np <dig> cultures relative to the p <dig> cultures supports this argument. less clear is why the marinobacter are not present in large numbers in the p <dig> culture. although marinobacter can utilize perchlorate under saline conditions the simplest explanation is that the yet to be cultured rhodobacteraceae species are simply better adapted to the saline environment. previous studies  <cit>  showed that marinobacter sp. p4b <dig> grew much better at low salt  than in the 3% concentration used here.

the genera azoarcus and thauera were consistently found in the metagenome studies as representatives of the rhodocyclaceae that are major components of both cultures. these organisms are phylogenetically similar to each other and both are close relatives of the widely-known perchlorate-reducers of the betaproteobacteria genera dechloromonas and azospira  <cit> . members of azoarcus and thauera are known as denitrifiers capable of halobenzoate degradation  <cit> . in another study, azoarcus was one of the major organisms in a toluene-degrading compost biofilter  <cit> . in a previous study of the np <dig> microbial community by fluorescent in situ hybridization   <cit> , azoarcus was proposed to be a major perchlorate reducer in np <dig>  however, the pure azoarcus strain ny isolated from the np <dig> culture in this study was not able to reduce perchlorate after over ~120 days’ incubation. since nitrate was not available in the p <dig> mixed culture, the azoarcus strain that was isolated need not be a denitrifier. two ecologically different groups of azoarcus exist: 1) soil-borne strains which can degrade aromatic hydrocarbons under denitrifying conditions, and 2) “plant-associated” strains which can fix nitrogen and require microaerobic conditions for growth on n <dig>  <cit> . if strain ny is truly representative of the community, then the members of the azoarcus in p <dig> and np <dig> may be the plant-associated type that are growing under microaerophilic conditions produced during perchlorate degradation.

matches to roseovarius, rhodobacter, or ruegeria were frequently found in the metagenome studies. likewise, rhodobacter sequences were consistently observed in dgge analysis of the p <dig> culture as well  <cit> . unfortunately, no members of the rhodobacteraceae that dominate the p <dig> cultures have yet been obtained in pure culture. in the course of earlier fish studies, roseobacter accounted for only 0-5% of the total organisms in the np <dig> culture  <cit> . this is consistent with the much reduced representation of the rhodobacteraceae seen in the metagenome analysis of the np <dig> culture described here.

the genus stappia is also in the rhodobacteraceae. two stappia strains now and nyo were isolated in the pure culture studies, but they were recovered unexpectedly from the np <dig> culture where rhodobacteraceae are present in small numbers. the genus was created from reclassification of marine agrobacterium  <cit>  and is closely related to ruegeria. they usually form star-shaped-aggregates  <cit> , which were observed in the isolated stappia strain nw. the type species of ruegeria, ruegeria atlantica, could reduce nitrate to nitrite and to n <dig> gas  <cit> , while some species of ruegeria could only reduce nitrate to nitrite but not to n <dig> gas  <cit> . neither of the pure strains, nwo and nyo, could reduce perchlorate.

previous attempts to use real time pcr and other biochemical techniques from the literature to quantify and or isolate and purify enzymes associated with perchlorate and/or nitrate reduction were unsuccessful. the metagenome data allowed a preliminary search for such genes. many, e.g. the perchlorate reductase genes belonging to the pcrabcd cluster and the chorite dismutase genes, were in fact found in both the p <dig> and np <dig> cultures. however, the matches to known sequences were moderate to low, which likely explains earlier difficulty in amplifying them. this difference may be due to the saline environment.

CONCLUSIONS
the major components of the p <dig> and np <dig> microbial communities have been established and several representative strains obtained in pure culture. members of the rhodobacteraceae dominate the p <dig> culture, but their numbers dramatically decrease in the np- <dig> culture that is fed both nitrate and perchlorate. the rhodobacteraceae are largely replaced in the np <dig> culture with members of the rhodocyclaceae and to a lesser extent the altermonadaceae. consistent with their common ancestry, the rest of the community remains similar in the two cultures. with the community structure established at the family level, it will now be possible to attempt to culture additional key community members by utilizing published recipes and growth conditions of known members of the same families.

although almost all known perchlorate-reducing organisms can effectively reduce nitrate, the rhodobacteraceae that dominate the p <dig> culture apparently can’t and thus may represent a novel group of perchlorate reducers. these rhodobacteraceae, as well as other organisms in these cultures, may be a promising source of unique salt-tolerant enzymes for perchlorate reduction.
