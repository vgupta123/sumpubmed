BACKGROUND
micro rnas  are  <dig> to  <dig> nt long, non-coding, single-stranded rnas that can fine-tune the expression of protein-encoding genes  <cit> . one example is the post-transcriptional repression of mrna targets involving the so called mirna "seed" which is nt 2- <dig> of the mature mirna which recognizes complementary bases in the 3'untranslated region of the mrna target  <cit> . mirna genes form primary transcripts that are converted by drosha to mirna precursors of 70- <dig> nt length. processing of mirna precursors into mature mirna's is catalyzed by the rna processing enzyme dicer  <cit> . processing enzymes recognize the secondary hairpin-structure of the mirna precursor  <cit> . most mirna precursors have indeed a distinctive stem-loop structure that is often highly conserved among distant species and that is used to distinguish them from other small rna classes.

the exact number of mirna genes, collective expression of which makes the mirna repertoire of an organism, is not known and the question how new mirna genes arise is an interesting and insufficiently studied problem in evolutionary biology. the conserved hairpin structure in mirna precursors was applied in two primary mirna identification methods: directional cloning and computational identification  <cit> . consequently, newly evolved, not-conserved mirnas were likely to be overlooked by these methods. furthermore, some mirna gene candidates accumulated sequence mutations that, over time, either led to mature mirna genes or to gene inactivation  <cit> . both actions make it difficult today to trace back the origin of mirna genes. using a deep sequencing approach, a large group of evolutionarily young mirna genes was discovered in drosophila  <cit> . in this study, a high birth rate of new mirna genes was described . the main sources for gaining mirna genes in plants are based on mirna gene duplication events and local inverted duplication events of short segments from protein-coding genes  <cit> . an alternative source of short inverted sequence segments could be based on transposons as these often carry terminal inverted repeats or as they can insert at short distance from their origin, resulting in an inverted gene arrangement  <cit> . the involvement of transposons in the birth of clusters of mirna genes might be underestimated as computational mirna detection methods were designed to exclude transposon sequences  <cit> . however, recent analyses in several mammalian species  <cit>  indicated that a number of mirna gene clusters were derived from repetitive elements. this may have contributed to "leaps" in the expansion of the mirna repertoire in placental mammals  <cit> .

approximately, 40% of the mouse genome is composed of repetitive elements, the largest part of which is interspersed between or within genes. two examples are simple repeats and b <dig> elements , an alu-like family of retrotransposons in rodents). each occupies a similar fraction of the mouse genome   <cit> . mouse b <dig> elements are rodent-specific retrotransposons  that may have originated from reverse transcription of ancestral 7sl rna  <cit> . transposable elements like b <dig> in mice and alu in humans were previously thought to be either harmless "junk" or to influence functional genes negatively  <cit> . more recently, however, it was proposed that retrotransposons can actually contribute to gene function and genome evolution, either by promoting local duplications, inversions or deletions events or by altering gene expression  <cit> . simple repeats are present in micro- and, minisatellites which are short tandem repeats of one repetitive unit  <cit>  with a characteristic length and sequence. for instance, in microsatellites, the repeat unit is  <dig> to  <dig> bp long. it has been shown that microsatellites are characterized by a high sequence mutation rate   <cit> . this makes microsatellites an adaptable reservoir for genetic changes, in addition to the phenomenon that numerous host genes evolved from retrotransposons  <cit> .

a number of recent findings suggest that the biology of mirna's and of retrotransposons may be connected at several levels. one starting point is the idea that rna interference is a mechanism that protects genomes against an unacceptably high, self-destructive retrotransposon activity  <cit> . interestingly, the rna interference pathway and the maturation and action of mirnas share some processing proteins and both mediate endonucleolytic cleavage  <cit> . furthermore, the evolutionary growth of an alu-rich primate mirna cluster  <cit>  and a marsupial mirna cluster  <cit>  were proposed to be driven by local duplication events involving retrotransposons. for the mirna genes in the human chromosome  <dig> cluster, the encoded seed sequence was found to be complementary to the most conserved parts of alu rna  <cit> .

in the present study we have analyzed the sequence of a large mirna cluster which is specifically located in intron  <dig> of the sfmbt <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig> of the mouse . this cluster is very rich in b <dig> retrotransposons and microsatellites, which are ordered in a regular manner. in rats the same repeat elements are present, but small changes in dna sequence may have resulted in less-stable hairpins and failure to form mature mirna from precursors. in all other mammals an ortholog of c2mc could not be detected. on basis of this analysis we propose that b <dig> retrotransposons have contributed to rapid growth of the mouse c2mc mirna cluster, which further illustrates the connection between retrotransposition and the evolution of a mirna repertoire in mammals.

RESULTS
 <dig>  large mouse-specific mirna gene cluster in intron  <dig> of the sfmbt <dig> gene
during our search for mammalian mirna gene clusters in which sine repeats may have contributed to cluster growth  <cit>  our attention was drawn to c2mc, a large group of mirna genes on chromosome  <dig> of the mouse. this cluster is located in intron  <dig> of the sfmbt <dig> gene and spans more than  <dig> kb . the c2mc cluster is predicted to contain  <dig> mirna genes which are annotated by ucsc and which are present in mirbase. each mirna gene in the cluster is encoded by the  strand, i.e. parallel to the coding strand of the sfmbt <dig> gene. the c2mc cluster was found to be specifically present in the mouse when considering orthologs or paralogs of the sfmbt <dig> gene. first, in or immediately around the paralogous mouse sfmbt <dig> gene, no mirna genes were found . second, no mirna genes associated with the sfmbt <dig> gene were found in any other species, except for the rat where one mirna gene was found in intron  <dig> . in fact, we noticed that in the total  <dig> kb area of the mouse sfmbt <dig> locus, sequence homology to other mammals  was lowest with the mouse intron  <dig> region . low sequence homology was also found with between mouse sfmbt <dig> intron  <dig> and the same region in genomes of rabbit, ground squirrel, guinea pig and kangaroo rat . as can be seen in additional file  <dig> figure s1b, the rat orthologous intron  <dig> region on chromosome  <dig> is of the same size as in the mouse  and has a high density of simple repeats and sine elements. repeats are also clustered in intron  <dig> of the mouse . when we looked in further detail in the central region of intron  <dig> of the mouse  we found a regular spacing of mirna genes, simple repeats and sine repeats with an apparent repeat length of  <dig>  kb and we propose to call this repeat unit mlong <dig>  a tandem array of  <dig> mlong <dig> elements is sufficient to account for all mirna genes in the center of the c2mc cluster . the sine repeats of the mouse sfmbt <dig> intron  <dig> are all classified as b <dig>  which belong to the alu family. the b <dig> elements in mlong <dig> are more frequent, significantly smaller and more uniform in orientation than b <dig> elements in the collected set of all other introns of mouse chromosome  <dig> . we next investigated the exact composition of the  <dig>  kb repeat unit mlong <dig> 

 <dig>  tandem repeats of mshort <dig> explain the cluster of mirna genes in the sfmbt <dig> gene
blast analysis of mlong <dig> indicated that this repeat was in itself a composite unit, built by a tandem array of ten mshort <dig> elements . the mshort <dig> consensus sequence  aligned to  <dig> individual mshort <dig> copies  that form a tandemly head-to-tail array in intron  <dig> of the sfmbt <dig> gene and together account for >90% of the intronic space. a more detailed view of the mshort <dig> element consensus  suggested that the first  <dig> nucleotides are a 3' fragment of the rodent b1f <dig> element, while the middle part  was homologous to the pre-mirna gene consensus which overlapped with two self-complementary microsatellites. the tandem repeat of mshort <dig> elements could account for all  <dig> pre-mirna genes that are annotated in the cluster. when clustering ten mshort <dig> elements into a mlong <dig> element, loss of sequence and accumulation of mutations may explain why only three pre-mrna genes and up to seven b1f <dig> fragments are recognized by blast . a similar situation exists in intron  <dig> of the sfmbt <dig> gene of the rat. in this species, a  <dig> nt rshort <dig> consensus was found that aligns to  <dig> copies which are also tandemly repeated . the mshort <dig> and rshort <dig> consensus elements were found to be homologous to each other , but mshort was extended by  <dig>  kb at its 3' end.

 <dig>  the mouse-specific mirna gene cluster expanded in two phases
we next constructed the phylogeny the individual mshort <dig> elements in order to model the evolutionary growth of c2mc. blast analysis allowed the identification of  <dig> mshort <dig> sub-clusters each of which containing  <dig> or  <dig> copies of highly similar mshort <dig> elements . mshort <dig> elements that could not be sub-clustered , were more distant from each other, as were mshort <dig> elements compared across sub-clusters. all sub-clustered mshort <dig> copies were found to be located in the center of c2mc , while the mshort <dig> elements that could not be sub-clustered were specifically present in the c2mc flanks. the regularly ordered arrangement of mshort <dig> units could be modeled by the formation of mlong <dig>  which is tandemly repeated in the center of c2mc . similar observations were made for rat rshort <dig> copies. however, the rat cluster central region has a less stringent fixation of rshort <dig> copies in longer units that would represent the rat equivalent to mouse mlong <dig> . these results suggest that, during the most recent expansion of the mouse mirna gene cluster, which occurred in the c2mc central region, an array of tandem repeated mshort <dig> copies, fixed as mlong <dig>  was duplicated  <dig> times.

 <dig>  mirnas in mshort <dig> and rshort <dig> are different from mirnas outside the sfmbt <dig> locus
all mirna genes in mshort <dig> and rshort <dig> belong to mirna families  <dig> and  <dig>  a hallmark of mirnas embedded in mshort <dig> and rshort <dig> is that the hairpin precursors overlap with two self-complementary microsatellites n and n, which might have shaped an ancestral hairpin. mirnas of families  <dig> and  <dig> are not exclusively found within c2mc, but also on other mouse chromosomes and in other species than mouse and rat. however, blast analysis of other genomes  for mshort <dig> retrieved no results while in mouse and rat gave only results within intron  <dig> of the sfmbt <dig> gene. to analyze the relationship between the members of the mirna families  <dig> and  <dig> in detail, we selected the  <dig> pre-mirnas of these two families that are located in other species and outside c2mc. we added 100nt up- and downstream sequence to evaluate cross-species conservation and compared the sequences to mshort <dig> and rshort <dig>  all analyzed pre-mirna sequences of the other species contained microsatellites resembling a n repeat instead of a n or n repeats as found in the c2mc mirna genes. an exception might be the sequence containing has-mir- <dig> with n and n microsatellites . we also assessed the impact of the microsatellite-related mirna-stem on mirna family classification by pairwise alignments. the consensus sequence of mshort <dig> and rshort <dig> was included in the analysis to represent the c2mc mirna genes. with an exception from mshort1/rshort <dig> and sequences of mirna- <dig>  no sequence similarity was detected any other mirna precursor sequence when the microsatellite content was masked . therefore, it is likely that mirna genes in mshort <dig> and rshort <dig> have originated independently from all other mirnas that are classified within mirna gene families  <dig> and  <dig> 

 <dig>  secondary structure predicts a more stable hairpin in mshort <dig> than in rshort1
the next point we addressed was the paradox that, although intron  <dig> of the rat and mouse genes contain mainly copies of short <dig> including self-complementary microsatellites, the mouse has  <dig> mirna-producing genes in this region, while the rat only has one gene that expresses mir-466d. a possible explanation could be the stability of the secondary structures, which are considered relevant for pre-mirna processing by drosha and dicer  <cit> . to address this point, we predicted the secondary mrna structures from the rat and mouse short <dig> consensus sequence . the analysis was done using three structure prediction methods ). for mouse and rat, a  <dig> nt double stranded hairpin was found that coincided with the predicted pre-mirna sequence in the mouse. a major difference, however, was found in the entropy of the hairpin region, which was much lower as compared to immediate surroundings in the mouse than in the rat . when we repeated the analysis without the extra  <dig>  kb at the 3' end of mshort <dig>  a similar result was obtained as compared to full length mshort <dig> . therefore, we found a comparable overall stem-loop structure, but more pronounced differences in entropy in the region demarcating the 82- <dig> nt hairpin structure in the mouse mshort <dig>  a detailed view on the rshort <dig> hairpin showed that next to point mutations, two deletions of two nucleotides caused a shift in the hairpin structure. for example, in rshort <dig> nt  <dig> does not pair to nt  <dig>  as seen in mshort <dig>  but to nt  <dig> . consequently, the rshort <dig> hairpin does not resemble the pre-mirna structures of this mirna cluster as closely as mshort <dig> does. our results support the idea that both low entropy and structural resemblance is relevant for the pre-mirna processing in the mouse.

discussion
in this study, we analyzed the repeat elements of c2mc, a mouse specific mirna cluster in a large intron of a protein-encoding gene. the encoded protein sfmbt <dig>  belongs to the polycomb protein family which is implicated in embryonic development  <cit> . interestingly, the sfmbt2-gene is imprinted and primarily expressed from the paternal allele in early embryos  <cit> . this makes another example of a large cluster of non-coding small rna genes in regions of imprinted dna  <cit> . in the analysis we performed in this paper, evidence was found for the idea that b <dig> transposons together with two self-complementary microsatellites, have generated a mirna-containing cassette that has duplicated many times during a relatively short time of evolution. this idea fits well into an emerging concept that retroposon-driven local expansion of mirna clusters can contribute to the mirna repertoire of mammals  <cit> . in our analysis, the smallest repeat unit bearing one mirna gene  is composed of a 3' fragment of a b1f <dig> element, two microsatellites and additional sequence . the two microsatellites overlap with the mirna gene of mshort <dig> and could have created a stable hairpin due to base pair complementarity. perfect hairpins were proposed to be a source of de-novo generated plant mirnas  <cit> .

one can argue about the point whether or not the encoded small non-coding rnas in c2mc are "real" mirna's. in general, mirna's are defined by a combination of five criteria for both expression and biogenesis . previous work has indicated that the mirnas of c2mc fulfill three of these criteria  <cit> :  detection of a distinct expressed mature ~ <dig> nt rna transcript;  the identification of its precise genomic match;  the dependence on dicer for mirna production  <cit> . what is lacking for the c2mc mrna's is phylogenetic conservation of the ~ <dig> nt mirna sequence and its predicted fold-back precursor  <cit> . phylogenetic conservation may be exist, however as suggested by other mirnas that are classified together with c2mc mirna's into families  <dig> and 467)  <cit> . but one should be cautious about this as, we found that this family classification does largely depend on the microsatellite related origin of these mirnas. while mirnas of c2mc do contain a combination of n and n microsatellite, the other species' mirnas grouped in these mirna families generally involve a n microsatellite . indeed, when we analyzed a  <dig> nt sequence with the microsatellite content masked, the mirna genes of c2mc showed no sequence similarity to other mirnas the  <dig> and  <dig> families. therefore, the mirnas of c2mc might have a different origin, and should perhaps be grouped in a separate mirna family. an interesting detail is that mouse mirnas of families  <dig> and  <dig> that do not belong to c2mc could not be confirmed in an experimental mirna evaluation approach  <cit> . the last criterion for mirna evaluation describes structural requirements for a hairpin precursor that contains the ~ <dig> nt mirna sequence. in this criterion, the hairpin must be the folding alternative with the lowest free energy and should not contain large internal loops or bulges, particularly not asymmetric bulges  <cit> . we have arguments that the small rna's from c2mc are different from pirnas . first, pirna gene clusters are present in intergenetic regions  <cit> , while the small rna's in c2mc are encoded in an intron of a protein-encoding gene. second, the mature small rnas of c2mc have a length of  <dig> nt, which is characteristic of mirnas, and smaller as the length of pirnas   <cit> .

differences between mshort <dig> and rshort <dig> should explain why the mouse mirna cluster c2mc contains more mirnas than its rat counterpart. in comparison to mshort <dig>  the right arm of the rshort <dig> hairpin shifted laterally by  <dig> nt and gained  <dig> asymmetrical bulges, while mshort <dig> had none . an energy profile of primary mirna transcripts is described for humans. there, the region of the lower hairpin stem towards the basal segments and the upper stem close to the drosha cleavage site were identified as thermodynamic most stable  <cit> . this energy profile is accentuated by the entropy profiles of mshort <dig>  but it is less consistent with the profile of rshort <dig> . further, sequences flanking the hairpins were described as essential for efficient in vitro processing  <cit> . however, rshort <dig> lacks this sequence on its  <dig> prime side . together these differences might explain the low number of genes producing mature mirnas in the rat cluster.

the results of blast analysis of mshort <dig> suggests a model for the evolution of c2mc . short <dig> copies accumulated via a recombination-based mechanism in the common rodent ancestor of today's mice and rats . these ancestral short <dig> units may have been more similar to mshort <dig> than to rshort <dig>  in fact, some repeat units in the cluster of modern rats resemble mshort <dig> instead of rshort <dig>  while all repeat units in modern mice only resemble mshort <dig> . thus, a truncation event resulting in the ~200nt rshort <dig> occurred in the rat after the speciation of mice and rats. we speculate that single nucleotide mutations and small deletion events in  <dig> neighboring mshort <dig> units, caused the formation of one larger unit mlong <dig> . mlong <dig> was further multiplied in the c2mc center. this model is similar to what we proposed before in primates . in the mouse the individual mirnas of c2mc have been duplicated together with a b1f <dig> retrotransposon.

what could be the biological implication of the growth of the c2mc mirna gene cluster? one possibility is that such growth contributes to the well known expansion of a mirna gene repertoire in mammals  <cit> . in order to regulate a great diversity of mrna targets, a repertoire of "seeds" is needed. this requires a large set of mirna genes. local duplication events of mirna genes in clusters are, therefore, to some extent analogous to a repertoire of variable immunoglobulin, t-cell receptor and trypanosome variable surface glycoprotein genes  <cit> . a problem with this explanation is that the growth of the c2mc cluster has not yet generated new "seeds'" to regulate novel mrna targets: the mirnas from c2mc share the "seed" region within a group of five distinct mirna clusters, present in mouse, human and zebra fish  <cit> . on the other hand, the mirna genes may be evolutionary young and since they overlap with microsatellites, rapid evolution of the "seed" sequences may still occur. another possibility of gene duplication is a dosage effect of mirna's with the same seed. this is particularly interesting for imprinted genes such as sfmbt <dig>  more research is needed to evaluate the impact of mirna concentration generated by the mirna genes in c2mc and to compare this action with that other amplified mirna clusters, e.g. on chromosome  <dig> in primates.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we analyzed c2mc, a large mouse mirna cluster that expanded during the time since mice and rats diverged from each other. our data indicate that a b1f <dig> retrotransposon has contributed to the generation of a tandemly repeated unit mshort <dig>  which grouped into the  <dig>  kb mlong <dig> element. the latter led to rapid growth in the center of the cluster by further duplication events. our study indicates that c2mc is a new example of the phenomenon in which lineage-specific sine elements contribute to growth of the mirna gene repertoire in a particular species.
