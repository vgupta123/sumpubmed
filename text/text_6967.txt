BACKGROUND
the fumonisins were discovered in  <dig> and are divided in four series a, b, c, p  <cit> with the b <dig> , b <dig>  and b <dig>  as the most abundant naturally occurring homologues  <cit> . they were first isolated from fusarium verticillioides  strain mrc  <dig> by gelderblom et al.  <cit> . fb <dig> is mainly produced by f. verticillioides and f. proliferatum  <cit> . however, production of type b fumonisins by other fusarium spp. has also been reported, e.g. from f. dlaminii, f. napiforme, f. nygamai and f. oxysporum  <cit> . fumonisins are important mycotoxins because they are suspected to cause human and animal toxicoses by the consumption of contaminated corn-based food and feeds  <cit> . fumonisins have been shown to induce outbreaks of equine leukoencephalomalacia in horses and pulmonary edema and hydrothorax in pigs  <cit> . the fumonisins are structurally similar to sphingolipids and have shown to inhibit the sphingolipid biosynthesis via the ceramide synthase pathway  <cit> . to avoid possible health risks, the u.s. food and drug administration recommends that corn products should not be used for human consumption when contaminated with more than 2- <dig> mg/kg total fumonisins   <cit> . whereas eec has a regulatory limit of  <dig> - <dig> mg/kg   <cit> .

fumonisins produced by fusarium species have been isolated from corn  <cit>  and corn based products  <cit>  such as tortillas  <cit>  and beer  <cit> , as well as other commodities like rice  <cit> , black tea leaves  <cit> , asparagus  <cit>  and pine nuts  <cit> .

factors that affect the production of fumonisins in fusarium have been well studied, and include solid substrates  <cit> , liquid substrates  <cit> , temperature  <cit> , water activity   <cit> , ph  <cit> , addition of nitrogen repressor  <cit> , aeration of the substrate  <cit>  and addition of fumonisin precursors  <cit> , but often corn kernels have been used as substrate since corn is the primary crop infected with f. verticillioides.

recently putative homologues to the f. verticillioides fumonisin gene cluster were found in two different aspergillus niger genomes  <cit> , and it was subsequently shown that three full genome sequenced strains and the ex type strain of a. niger actually can produce fb <dig> in comparable amounts to fusarium strains  <cit>  when grown on agar substrates with high amounts of sugar, glycerol or nacl.

this was followed by the discovery of additional fb <dig> production  by a. niger  <cit>  in agar cultures and naturally a. niger contaminated thai coffee beans  <cit> .

the objectives of the present work were to i) screen a. niger and fusarium strains, for production of fb <dig>  fb <dig> and fb <dig> on three different agar substrates, ii) investigate the effect of incubation temperature on the production of fumonisins and iii) study the effect of the solutes glycerol, nacl and sucrose on the production of fumonisins. the current work is performed on agar media instead of natural substrates in order to more easily asses the water activity.

RESULTS
optimization of extraction
the efficiency of five different extraction solvents to extract fb <dig> from a. niger  varied significantly, with methanol:water  being most efficient, followed by acetonitrile:water  with a 20% lower efficiency and methanol:dichloromethane:ethyl acetate  . the use of water  and hot water  was not suitable for extraction of fb <dig> from a. niger nrrl  <dig> with a relative efficiency of <1%, when compared to methanol:water. the most effective solvents concerning f. verticillioides ibt  <dig> were acetonitrile:water  as the best followed by methanol:water  and water at room temperature with an efficiency of 93%. the use of hot water as extraction solvent was less efficient , compared to methanol:water. the acidic methanol:dichloromethane:ethyl acetate , had the lowest extraction efficiency with 26%. the difference between each of the two replicates for all incidences was in the interval 1-40% with an average of 10%.

validation of methanol-water extraction from a. niger
the recovery of fb <dig> from two spiked non-fb <dig> producing strains showed a recovery of 75% ± 10%  and 85% ± 10% . the calibration curves from standards and spiked samples, used to calculate recovery from all had r <dig> better than  <dig> . the relative standard deviation  of the extracted amounts of fb <dig> from the  <dig> isolates  varied within 4-50%, with an average rsd of 20%. lod were found to be  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> fungal culture.

screening of strains for fumonisin production
the results from the screening experiment are shown in table  <dig>  the a. niger strains were able to produce fb <dig> on all three substrates, with the highest production on rc and cyas. none of the a. niger strains produced detectable amounts of neither fb <dig> nor fb <dig>  lc-ms/ms analyses have shown that fb <dig> is produced along with fb <dig>  although the amount of fb <dig> normally lies in the range 5-20% of the fb <dig> amounts  <cit> .

the concentration of fb <dig> was detected in the methanol:water  extract. the values are means of the replicates plus/minus the standard deviation. the replicates are made in biological duplicates on two separate plates.

n.d. not detected.

standard deviation calculated on two measurements

of the a. niger strains, nrrl  <dig> had the highest production of fb <dig> on rc and cyas. but on pda the three strains, nrrl  <dig>  nrrl  <dig> and ibt  <dig>  produced very similar amounts of fumonisins, although lower than rc and cyas. the fb <dig> production on rc and cyas of a. niger nrrl  <dig>  ibt  <dig> and  <dig> differed only slightly, whereas fb <dig> production by the other two, nrrl  <dig> and nrrl  <dig> were clearly favored by growth on rc. all fusarium spp. with the exception of the two f. dlaminii strains ibt  <dig> and ibt  <dig> produced fumonisins under these conditions. six fusarium strains, f. napiforme ibt  <dig>  f. proliferatum ibt  <dig> and ibt  <dig>  f. verticillioides ibt  <dig> and f. nygamai ibt  <dig> produced amounts close to the detection limit of fb <dig> on rc; in addition ibt  <dig> also produced fumonisins on pda. f. nygamai ibt  <dig>  ibt  <dig> and ibt  <dig> showed a higher production of fb <dig> than fb <dig> on pda , and f. proliferatum ibt  <dig> had the highest concentration of total fumonisin measured. only seven strains had a total production of fumonisin above  <dig> μg/ml extract on rc compared to  <dig> strains on pda.

seven fusarium strains did not have any measurable production of fb <dig>  fb <dig> nor fb <dig> on pda compared to two non-producers on rc. on the other hand pda supported production of higher amounts of fumonisins, strains which had a barely detectable amount of fb <dig> on rc, also showed production of either fb <dig> or both fb <dig> and fb <dig> on pda.

strains for the next experiments were selected on the basis of the above mentioned experiments. besides the five a. niger strains five fusarium strains were selected, with both good and poor producers at 25°c, two strains with a high fb production, f. verticillioides ibt  <dig> and f. oxysporum ibt  <dig>  one with an average fb production f. proliferatum ibt  <dig>  one with a low fb <dig> production f. napiforme ibt  <dig> and a strain with a higher production of fb <dig> than fb <dig> f. nygamai ibt  <dig> was selected.

the effect of temperature on growth and production of fumonisins by a. niger and fusarium spp
only one of the a. niger strains was able to grow at 15°c, although very slowly . the growth increased at higher temperature and peaked at 30-37°c, followed by a slight reduction of the growth at 42°c. all fusarium strains were able to grow at 15°c followed by an increased growth at higher temperatures and peaked at 25-30°c, above this temperature the growth decreased and no growth was observed at 42°c. the effect of temperature on the production of fb <dig> by the five a. niger strains is shown in figure 1a. none of the isolates produced detectable amounts of fb <dig> at 42°c, even though all strains grew well. the only a. niger strain, nrrl  <dig>  that was able to grow at 15°c, did not have any detectable production of fb <dig> 

at 37°c, the optimal temperature for growth by a. niger, the fb <dig> production was very limited. nrrl  <dig> had the highest production of the five strains at 25°c and 30°c; however at 20°c nrrl  <dig> showed the highest production. this strain showed also the highest growth rate at this temperature. four strains, nrrl  <dig>  nrrl  <dig>  nrrl  <dig> and ibt  <dig> had the highest fb <dig> production at 25°c, followed by 30°c, 20°c, and 37°c . one strain, ibt  <dig>  differed from the other four, since it had a maximal production at 30°c, followed by 25°c, 20°c and 37°c.

the concentration of fb <dig>  fb <dig> and fb <dig> produced by fusarium spp. is shown in figure 1b, and four of the fusarium spp. had maximal production at 20°c: f. verticillioides ibt  <dig>  f. proliferatum ibt  <dig>  f. napiforme ibt  <dig> and f. nygamai ibt  <dig>  f. oxysporum ibt  <dig> had a maximal production of fumonisin at 25°c. only three of the fusarium strains, f. verticillioides ibt  <dig>  f. oxysporum ibt  <dig> and f. proliferatum ibt  <dig> had a measurable production of fumonisin at 15°c. f. napiforme ibt  <dig> was only able to produce detectable amounts of fumonisins in the temperature range 20-25°c. at 20°c this strain had detectable concentrations of fb <dig>  fb <dig> and fb <dig>  but at 25°c only fb <dig> and fb <dig> were detected . even though there was growth of all five fusarium strains at 37°c there were only in one case detectable production of fumonisins, this was produced by f. verticillioides.

the effect of glycerol, nacl and sucrose on the growth and production of fumonisins by a. niger and fusarium spp
all strains of a. niger and fusarium spp. were able to grow at all glycerol concentration  . the growth of a. niger was only slightly reduced at aw  <dig> ; below this there was a continuous decrease in the growth. for the fusarium spp. the growth was reduced at aw  <dig>  and below, which was the same as the a. niger. all a. niger strains were able to produce fb <dig> at all glycerol concentrations tested . the effect of glycerol on the quantitative fb <dig> production for a. niger was very strain dependent, but in general the average fb <dig> production was reduced  <dig> % per  <dig>  aw unit . three of the five fusarium strains were able to produce fumonisin at all glycerol concentrations: f. nygamai ibt  <dig>  f. oxysporum ibt  <dig> and f. verticillioides ibt  <dig> . for two of these, ibt  <dig> and ibt  <dig>  fumonisin production was increased up to 20% when glycerol was added. the other two strains f. napiforme ibt  <dig> and f. nygamai ibt  <dig> did not have a measurable production of fumonisins at aw  <dig>  and  <dig> . the average total fumonisin production was reduced 18% per  <dig>  aw unit .

for the five a. niger growth in the presence of nacl was partially inhibited below aw  <dig>  and all strains were able to grow at all aw tested. the fusarium species had the highest growth rates at the highest aw and the growth declined until aw  <dig>  where they were unable to grow.

the fb <dig> production of all a. niger strains was stimulated when nacl was added with fb <dig> being detected at all nacl concentrations . the production peaked at aw  <dig> - <dig>  depending on the strain. a reduction of the fb <dig> production started at aw  <dig> - <dig>  and a comparison by a regression analysis to the cultures with no nacl added the average production of fb <dig> decreased 13% per  <dig>  aw unit . the addition of nacl clearly reduces the production of fumonisins by fusarium , and was not detected in any culture below aw  <dig> . one strain, f. napiforme ibt  <dig>  did not even have a measurable production of fumonisin when nacl was added. but no correlations in the average decrease of fumonisin production was observed.

the a. niger and fusarium spp. strains grew better on sucrose, compared to nacl and glycerol. the addition of sucrose increased the production of fb <dig> for all the a. niger strains . the increase in the fb <dig> production was followed by either a reduction or stagnation in the production level at higher sucrose concentrations. the average decrease in the total fumonisin production were  <dig> % per  <dig>  aw unit 

only three of the five fusarium strains were able to produce fb <dig>  fb <dig> and fb <dig> when cultured on different sucrose concentrations . because a commercial potato extract without sucrose was not obtainable, the base potato extract was prepared on home-made boiled potatoes. the three fusarium strains with a detectable fumonisin production were f. oxysporum ibt  <dig>  f. proliferatum ibt  <dig> and f. verticillioides ibt  <dig>  fusarium oxysporum ibt  <dig> had a maximal production at aw  <dig> , while f. proliferatum ibt  <dig> peaked at aw  <dig>  and f. verticillioides ibt  <dig> peaked at aw  <dig> . a reduction of the fumonisin production was observed at higher sucrose concentrations. there were no correlations in the average decrease of fumonisin production

discussion
we found that a. niger was able to produce fb <dig>  in agreement with frisvad et al.  <cit>  who showed that a. niger produced fb <dig> on the agar substrates rc and cyas. on the other hand they did not measure any production of fb <dig> on pda, whereas all five a. niger strains in the present study had a detectable, albeit low, production of fb <dig> on this substrate. besides f. verticillioides, also f. napiforme, f. nygamai, f. proliferatum and f. oxysporum were found to produce fumonisins on laboratory agar substrates. the ability to produce fumonisins by these species correlates with findings of nelson et al.  <cit>  and kpodo et al.  <cit> . however nelson et al.  <cit>  described the production of fb <dig> by f. dlaminii, but this was not supported in our study. the findings of strains, capable of producing more fb <dig> than fb <dig> was also described by musser & plattner  <cit>  as well as leslie et al.  <cit> . apart from the four a. niger strains shown to produce fb <dig> by frisvad et al.  <cit> , additional  <dig> strains did produce this mycotoxin. among the  <dig> a. niger strains investigated until now, only two have been unable to produce fumonisins in detectable amounts on the media investigated.

astoreca et al.  <cit>  found the optimal temperature for growth of a. niger to be 30°c, the highest investigated temperature in their study. in correlation to this study palacios-cabrera et al.  <cit>  also found that a. niger grew optimally at temperatures of 30°c, which was also the optimal temperature for linear growth in our study. marin et al.  <cit>  found that the growth of both f. verticillioides and f. proliferatum was best at  <dig> to 30°c, which is in agreement of our results. according to marin et al.  <cit> f. verticillioides is more tolerant to temperature above 30°c than other fusarium spp., however this was not obvious in our study.

we found that the optimal production of fb <dig> by a. niger was at 25°c and in one case 30°c. since there has been only one report of the fumonisin production by a. niger we have compared our results to the production of ochratoxin a. our results correlates with an investigation of esteban et al.  <cit> , who showed that the optimal temperature for production of ochratoxin a by a. niger was at 20-25°c. in contrast to this, other authors found that the optimal ochratoxin a production in a synthetic grape juice medium was significantly better at 15°c compared to both  <dig> and 35°c  <cit> . findings in our study showed that at 20°c a significant decrease in the fb <dig> production occurred compared to 30°c. earlier studies show that the optimal temperature for production of fumonisins by f. proliferatum is at 15-20°c where f. verticillioides prefers the higher temperatures of 30°c  <cit> . this partly correlates with the results from our study, where both isolates showed the highest production at 20°c, but also produced fumonisins at 30°c. however fumonisin production by f. verticillioides was less inhibited than f. proliferatum by the higher temperature. dilkin et al.  <cit>  and alberts et al.  <cit>  found the optimal temperature for fumonisin production to be 25°c, followed by  <dig> and then 30°c. these results deviate from our results, because four isolates had the best production at 20°c and one at 25°c. marin et al.  <cit>  described the production of fb <dig> by f. verticillioides at 37°c, which was also observed in our study. from our results a general pattern in the fumonisin production for both genera was observed, namely the maximal production of fumonisins being 5°c below the optimal growth.

comparing a. niger with the fusarium spp., all a. niger strains grew better at all tested aw values. leong et al.  <cit>  found the optimal aw for ochratoxin a production by a. niger to be aw  <dig> , whereas esteban et al <cit>  found it to be in the range of  <dig> - <dig> , and that it was very strain dependent. these values are lower than those observed in our study for fumonisins where four of the a. niger strains had the highest production of fb <dig> at aw  <dig> , with one isolate produced most fb <dig> at aw  <dig> . earlier studies have shown that the optimal aw for fumonisin production by fusarium is in the interval  <dig> - <dig>   <cit> . the optimal aw value from our study was aw  <dig> , which is a bit higher than the above mentioned aw values. frisvad et al.  <cit>  also found that the addition of 5% nacl  or 20% sucrose  increased the production of fb <dig> by a. niger. the present study showed that not all the used strains had the same pattern. only four of the five strains had an increase in fb <dig> production at aw  <dig>  compared to the zero sample when grown on nacl. the last a.niger nrrl  <dig> had only an increase at aw  <dig>  followed by a decrease at higher nacl concentrations. the same was observed with sucrose where three strains had an increase in the fb <dig> production compared to a sucrose concentration of 3% in standard medium. the last strains had a decrease in the production at the previous mentioned sucrose concentrations. in conclusion it is clear that there is very large strain variability in fumonisin production at different water activities between the a. niger strains used in these experiments.

further studies on the effect of physiological variables on fumonisin production by a. niger is needed on large numbers of strains, due to large strain differences, and should further be backed up by studies of commodities where a. niger is common. this will lead us to a better understanding of how large a food safety problem fumonisin production by a. niger is. only one report of fumonisins from a. niger in food  has been reported, however the amounts were well below the regulatory limit  <cit> . fumonisin contamination in a series of foods, often contaminated with a. niger, may show to be an overlooked mycotoxin problem, since surveys have only mostly targeted corn and rice, based on the belief that it was only fusarium spp. that could produce these important mycotoxins.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study shows that the regulation of fumonisin production is very different in a. niger compared to fusarium, with the latter preferring high aw  and low temperature  and with a. niger preferring lower aw and higher temperature . fumonisin produced by a. niger may be an overlooked health risk in foods not previously associated with fumonisins, especially because a. niger is known as a common food spoilage organism on a wide variety of foods  <cit> .
