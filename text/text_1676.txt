BACKGROUND
nima-r elated kinase  <dig>  is a member of the kinase family sharing sequence identity to catalytic domain of the essential aspergillus nidulans gene nima . mutations in nek <dig> are causal in the murine models of polycystic kidney disease kat and kat2j, resulting in a recessive pleiotropic phenotype that includes progressive cystic kidneys, male sterility, dwarfing, abnormal olfactory lobes, facial dysmorphism, choroid plexus cysts, hydrocephalus, uremia and anemia  <cit> . although it has been suggested that nek <dig> may play roles in cell-cycle control, meiosis, gametogenesis, and in the nervous system  <cit>  the cellular function of nek <dig> has remained elusive.

the neks are considered to be cell cycle kinases  <cit> , but some members of the family play additional roles in ciliary function. our studies in chlamydomonas revealed both cell cycle and ciliary functions for two neks: fa2p plays a role at the g2/m transition of the cell cycle and is essential for the deflagellation response  <cit> , whereas cnk2p is a ciliary protein that participates in the assessment of cell size prior to commitment to enter mitosis and plays a role in regulation of flagellar length  <cit> . a survey of the neks encoded by the genomes of various organisms supported our idea that the nek family may have co-evolved with the alternating use of centrioles as basal bodies and as the foci of spindle poles  <cit> . these results lead us to speculate that dual roles in ciliary and cell cycle regulation might be a hallmark of the nek family.

we recently completed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the nek family across the eukaryotes and discovered that they are an ancient family  <cit> . our analyses suggest that six or seven different neks were already present in the ciliated unicellular organism that gave rise to all of the eukaryotic lineages. the further observation that neks representative of each extant clade localize to centrosomes and/or cilia supports our idea that the original expansion of the neks was associated with dual roles in the regulation of cilia and the cell cycle, possibly co-ordinating ciliogenesis with cell cycle progression  <cit> . dual roles in cilia and cell cycle have not yet been demonstrated for any of the mammalian neks.

there is some indication that the mammalian kinase, nek <dig> may subserve both roles. aberrant ciliary signaling and cell cycle regulation are both implicated in the etiology of renal cysts  <cit>  and mutations in nek <dig> are causal for kidney cyst formation. additionally, we have previously localized nek <dig> to centrosomes  <cit> . we thus set out to explore the cellular activities of nek <dig> in order to further test our hypothesis about the dual roles of this kinase family.

here, we report that transient over-expression of mnek <dig> in the ciliated renal epithelial cell line imcd <dig> results in failure to assemble cilia. this effect depends upon the kinase activity of nek <dig>  in contrast, expression of dominant negative forms of nek <dig> caused disruption of centrosomes, as indicated by loss of γ-tubulin and centrin foci. these disruptive effects require the coiled-coil domain of nek <dig>  in addition to kinase activity. we show that the coiled-coil domain of nek <dig> is sufficient for nuclear, centrosomal and ciliary localization of the protein. we propose that nek <dig> activity in differentiated kidney epithelial cells contributes to the dynamic regulation of the centrosome and the primary cilium, a sensory apparatus critical for the maintenance of tubules and in the prevention of renal cytogenesis.

RESULTS
mnek <dig> is comprised of a basic region and an acidic region
transfected constructs are first expressed prior to post-mitotic ciliation
entry of a transfected plasmid into the nucleus to gain access to the transcription machinery is one of the critical steps limiting exogenous gene expression  <cit> . liposome-mediated transient transfection is greatly enhanced by events associated with mitosis  <cit> , probably due to the nuclear encapsulation of plasmid arising from the breakdown and reformation of the nuclear envelope  <cit> . two hours post-transfection with pegfp, we observe that ~80% of imcd <dig> cells expressing egfp are adjacent to another egfp-expressing cell, often still connected by a cytokinetic bridge . we infer that under our experimental conditions, cells first express exogenous protein following mitosis. thus, as previously reported by others, recently-transfected cells expressing the exogenous protein represent a population having recently completed mitosis.

cells reabsorb their cilia prior to mitosis and regrow them after mitosis . if the only cells expressing egfp in the first few hours after transfection are those that have recently completed mitosis, then we predicted that the extent of ciliation of this population of cells will increase with time, corresponding to post-division ciliogenesis. as expected, ciliation of egfp-expressing cells increases between  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-transfection .

transient over-expression of egfp-mnek <dig> disrupts ciliogenesis
subcellular localization of transiently transfected mnek <dig> n-terminally tagged with egfp matches previous reports of localization of the endogenous mnek <dig>  <cit> . that is, egfp-mnek <dig>  localizes to foci adjacent to the γ-tubulin-rich centrosomes  and is excluded from the nucleus . we observe that imcd <dig> cells transfected with egfp-mnek <dig> for  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> hours lack the primary cilium  but retain γ-tubulin-rich centrosomes . in contrast, cells transfected with egfp alone are increasingly ciliated over  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours . these data indicate that over-expression of mnek <dig> inhibits ciliogenesis.

in order to determine whether inhibition of ciliogenesis requires kinase activity, we generated the mutation k33r in the invariant lysine residue within the atp-binding domain  <cit> . the cognate mutation inactivates kinase function in nek <dig> and nek <dig>  <cit> . we refer to constructs containing this mutation as presumptive kinase-dead. in contrast to cells expressing mnek <dig> with a lysine at position  <dig>  cells expressing mnek <dig> containing the kinase-inactivating k33r mutation show no abnormal phenotype .

deletion of the presumptive regulatory acidic domain creates a dominant negative form of nek <dig> which disrupts centrosomes
several kinases, such as fak and plk, are regulated in part through inhibition of kinase activity by the c-terminal, non-kinase domain of the protein  <cit> . the c-terminus of nek <dig> can bind the n-terminal kinase domain  <cit> , and we sought to determine whether the acidic c-terminal domain of mnek <dig> influenced the ability of overexpressed egfp-mnek <dig> to disrupt the primary cilium.

imcd <dig> cells were transiently transfected with various truncations of egfp-tagged mnek <dig> and those expressing egfp were scored for the presence of centrosomes  and cilia . neither egfp alone, nor the egfp-tagged kinase domain of mnek <dig>  affected centrosomes or cilia , but expression of the egfp-tagged basic region  resulted in the loss of centrosomes in a substantial proportion of cells . given that the integrity of centrosomes is a pre-requisite for ciliogenesis, it is not surprising that these cells also lack cilia. cells expressing an egfp-n-terminal mnek <dig> fusion protein  retain their γ-tubulin foci and their cilia, indicating that disruption of centrosomes requires the coiled-coil domain present in residues 353– <dig>  with the exception of the kinase domain alone these truncations localize to the nucleus, an observation in accord with a previous report  <cit> .

quantification of the loss of γ-tubulin foci is based on examination of  <dig> transfected  cells from each of three independent experiments. these were scored as either retaining or lacking detectable γ-tubulin foci. shown is the average number of transfected cells that lack γ-tubulin foci, plus or minus the standard deviation. constructs containing at least the first two coiled-coils significantly reduce the number of transfected cells retaining γ-tubulin foci .

in order to determine which of the predicted coiled-coils is necessary for the depletion of γ-tubulin foci, we expressed a panel of egfp-tagged, truncated mnek <dig> constructs that sequentially remove the four coiled-coils of the coiled-coil domain. we observe that the constructs containing both coiled-coils  <dig> and  <dig> , the first three coiled-coils , and all four  cause depletion of γ-tubulin foci, whereas the constructs containing either none , or only the first coiled-coil  fail to deplete γ-tubulin foci. these data suggest that the second coiled-coil of mnek <dig>  is required for the depletion of γ-tubulin foci, whereas the third and forth coiled-coils are not involved in this activity.

in order to determine whether disruption of centrosomes requires kinase activity, we generated the presumptive kinase-dead k33r mutation in the various truncation constructs. in contrast to cells expressing truncated forms of mnek <dig> with a lysine at position  <dig>  cells expressing truncations of mnek <dig> containing the kinase-inactivating k33r mutation retain their γ-tubulin foci and their cilia . we conclude that kinase activity is required for disruption of centrosomes. in addition, these cells lacked foci of the centrosomal components pericentrin, pcm <dig>  bbs <dig> and the targets of autoimmune serum m <dig> . this indicates that the effect represents the loss of pericentriolar material, and is not specifically limited to γ-tubulin.

γ-tubulin loss occurs rapidly after expression of mnek <dig> and precedes centrin loss
to evaluate the kinetics of loss of the pericentriolar material of egfp-mnek <dig> , we examined cells during the first  <dig> hours post-transfection. in contrast to egfp-transfected cells , which displayed increasing numbers of ciliated cells and retention of γ-tubulin foci, egfp-mnek <dig>  transfected cells  lost their γ-tubulin foci  within the first four hours post-transfection. additionally, we never observed a cell transfected with egfp-mnek <dig>  retain exactly one γ-tubulin focus during the first  <dig> hours post-transfection . because the loss of detectable γ-tubulin foci occurs within a few hours, and because we did not observe cells with only one γ-tubulin focus, we infer that the loss of pericentriolar material is not a consequence of defects in centriolar replication or segregation of centrosomes during division.

in order to determine whether mnek <dig> affected the stability of the centrioles in addition to the pericentriolar proteins, we stained for centrin, a centriolar component that localizes to the distal centriolar lumen  <cit> . during the first 4- to 24-hours post transfection an increasing fraction of cells transfected with myc-mnek <dig>  lack centrin-containing foci , whereas cells transfected with the presumptive kinase-dead construct myc-mnek <dig>  retain centrin foci . co-staining with γ-tubulin revealed instances of cells with centrin foci devoid of γ-tubulin, but we never observed a cell that retained γ-tubulin foci that lacked centrin . these observations indicate that γ-tubulin loss precedes centrin loss. to determine whether gross detrimental effects to the cytoskeleton precede loss of γ-tubulin, we visualized cellular microtubules with an α-tubulin antibody. we did not observe changes in the microtubule network, even in cells that lack γ-tubulin foci , leading us to conclude that effects on the cytoskeleton did not cause the loss of γ-tubulin foci.

we next asked whether the disruptive forms of mnek <dig> were triggering loss of centrosomes as a consequence of causing activation of an apoptotic program. using an antibody against cleaved-parp as a marker for early apoptosis, we determined that cells lost their γ-tubulin foci and yet remained negative for cleaved-parp . furthermore, cleaved-parp positive cells are no more common in cultures transfected with disruptive constructs than in cell transfected with non-disruptive mnek <dig> constructs . we conclude that loss of γ-tubulin foci is not a consequence of apoptosis.

to evaluate whether transfected cells with compromised centrosomes continue to progress through the cell cycle, we co-stained with an antibody against pcna , an accessory protein for polymerase δ often used as a marker for cells in s phase  <cit> . at  <dig> hours post-transfection with myc-mnek <dig> , we observe that transfected cells lacking γ-tubulin foci are negative for pcna staining, whereas 10% of myc-mnek <dig>  expressing cells are positive for pcna . we conclude that mnek1-induced centrosomal loss results in failure to progress through the cell cycle. this is consistent with a recent report that the integrity of the centrosomes is a requirement for progression through the cell cycle  <cit> .

presumptive kinase-dead mnek <dig> localizes to the primary cilium
intriguingly, we observed ciliary and centrosomal localization of presumptive kinase-dead  versions of the same nek <dig> full-length and truncation constructs that caused inhibition of ciliogenesis and disruption of centrosomes, respectively . these data suggest that the disassembly of centrosomes induced by kinase-active forms of mnek <dig> requires correct targeting to these organelles.

expression of a panel of constructs that encode fusion proteins removing the four coiled-coils revealed that constructs containing coiled-coils  <dig> and  <dig> localize to the primary cilium  whereas coiled-coils  <dig> and  <dig> are dispensable for localization to the primary cilium . furthermore, the coiled-coil domain alone is sufficient for localization to the primary cilium .

the observation of nek <dig> localization to the primary cilium is novel. we have not observed endogenous mnek <dig> in the primary cilium , nor do we observe any of our other tagged-nek <dig> constructs in the cilium. based on these observations, we propose that nek <dig> may normally cycle through the ciliary compartment but only kinase-dead nek <dig> is retained in the cilia long enough  to be visualized.

discussion
nek <dig> is a centrosome-associated protein and mice without functional nek <dig> develop polycystic kidneys  <cit> . a link between centrosomal or ciliary dysfunction and the formation of kidney cysts is well-established and generally thought to be causal, although the molecular details have not yet been worked out  <cit> . kidney cysts are associated with aberrant cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and loss of proper orientation of mitotic spindles along the axis of the renal tubules  <cit> . this is consistent with a growing body of evidence that many signals for proliferation and differentiation are received and processed by the primary cilium  <cit> . consequently, nek <dig> provides a promising opportunity to test our prediction that some mammalian nek proteins play dual roles in the regulation of cilia and cell cycle progression  <cit> .

we have shown here that transient over-expression of mnek <dig> inhibits ciliogenesis and overexpression of a nek <dig> construct lacking its inhibitory domain causes disassembly of centrosomes. these data suggest that the normal function of the endogenous protein might involve regulation of centrosomal integrity and ciliogenesis. unfortunately, we were unable to complement this work with studies of mnek <dig> knock-down because none of our mnek <dig> rnai experiments yielded greater than 50% knock-down of mnek <dig> protein expression, and we did not detect any mutant phenotypes in these cells . it is unlikely that this failure to generate knock-down cells is a consequence of some essential function of mnek <dig> because the kat and kat2j mice are viable as homozygotes. nevertheless, the over-expression studies allow us to deduce some aspects of the cellular activities of nek <dig> 

we found that overexpression of full-length nek <dig> and certain truncated forms of the protein inhibit ciliogenesis . we think that the over-expression phenotype is a consequence of excessive mnek <dig> kinase activity. this conclusion is supported by the observation that over-expression of presumptive kinase-dead forms of mnek <dig> do not inhibit ciliogenesis. over-expression of full-length kinase is expected to add substantial nek <dig> kinase activity to the cell, even if the bulk of the protein is inhibited. an excess of nek <dig> activity could inhibit ciliogenesis by blocking post-mitotic upregulation of ciliary proteins, by interfering with assembly or docking of pre-ciliary complexes at the centrosome, or by stimulating excessive rates of ciliary disassembly.

there are precedents for nek activity to enhance rates of ciliary disassembly. ciliary assembly, disassembly and length control are all mediated by a balance of the rates of anterograde and retrograde ift . the chlamydomonas nek cnk <dig> is an axonemal protein that affects ciliary length by modulating the rate of disassembly and the delay before onset of assembly  <cit> . stable overexpression results in cilia that are shorter than normal, whereas rnai-based knockdown results in long cilia. the shorter flagella were shown to be a consequence of accelerated rates of disassembly in the chlamydomonas cells that were overexpressing cnk <dig>  importantly, the longer cilia in cells with reduced cnk <dig> were not a consequence of decreased rates of disassembly. rather, when levels of cnk <dig> are reduced there is a decrease in the lag time preceding ciliary assembly. taken together, these data suggest that activated cnk <dig> promotes ciliary disassembly both during reabsorption of cilia and in the initial stages of ciliogenesis, perhaps providing a ciliary assembly checkpoint which coordinates ciliogenesis with exit from mitosis. in the multi-ciliated protist tetrahymena, overexpression of the cnk <dig> orthologs also result in short cilia, suggesting conservation of function  <cit> . nek <dig> may directly regulate the ift machinery because it directly interacts with kif3a, a subunit in the heterotrimeric molecular motor kinesin- <dig> responsible for anterograde ift  <cit> .

overexpression of the mitotic kinase aurora a leads to the loss of cilia in mammalian cells  <cit> . although the disappearance of cilia was attributed to disassembly, inhibition of post-mitotic ciliogenesis was not ruled out. nevertheless, loss of cilia in the context of excess aurora a was shown to be mediated by activation of the tubulin deacetylase hdac <dig>  pugacheva and colleagues showed that cilia are retained in cells with excess aurora a, if these cells are treated with hdac inhibitors. in contrast, we could not rescue nek1-dependent cilia loss by incubation with the same hdac inhibitors, although acetylation of microtubules was greatly increased in these cells . we conclude that nek <dig> is affecting ciliogenesis by a different pathway than aurora a.

we next considered the possibility that nek <dig> was affecting ciliogenesis as a consequence of disruptive effects on the centrosomes/basal body apparatus, the docking site for protein complexes en route to the cilium. we did not detect disruption of localization of centrosomal components in cells overexpressing nek <dig> , nevertheless these cells failed to assemble cilia. it is possible that there may have been subtle centrosomal defects not detected because when truncation mutants lacking the presumptive inhibitory c-terminal domain were expressed, we detected rapid loss of γ-tubulin at the centrosomes, followed by loss of the centrin signal . similar to the inhibition of ciliogenesis by the full-length protein, these effects depended upon the kinase activity of nek <dig> because constructs carrying the kinase-disrupting mutation k33r did not disrupt centrosomal integrity and ciliogenesis occurred normally . we interpret these data to reflect a more severe augmentation of nek <dig> kinase activity by the truncation mutants, which may be constitutively active. if the centrosome disassembly induced by these mutant forms of the protein reflects a pathological manifestation of a more subtle centrosome-remodelling activity of the endogenous protein, then these data would support the idea that the inhibition of ciliogenesis by over-expression of full-length mnek <dig> might be secondary to effects on the integrity of the centrosome.

we observed that presumptive kinase-dead nek <dig> truncation mutants localized to the cilium and the nucleus . kinase-active proteins were also found in the nucleus, but these cells did not have cilia . we used presumptive kinase-dead constructs to identify a ciliary targeting domain in the first two coiled-coils of mnek <dig> . this same domain is also required for the centrosome/primary cilium disruption caused by expression of constructs that encode the wild-type kinase domain, suggesting that nek <dig> might act directly on the centrosome and possibly also within the cilium. one caveat is that although the coiled-coil domain of mnek <dig> is sufficient for localization to the primary cilium, fusion proteins composed of the entire c-terminus of mnek <dig>  fail to localize to the primary cilia . this could indicate that the c-terminus prevents ciliary accumulation. although we demonstrate the necessity of a functional ciliary targeting sequence for inhibition of ciliogenesis , we can not rule out the possibility that the effect was via nuclear activity because each of fusion proteins that disrupted centrosomes also localized to the nucleus.

CONCLUSIONS
based on our data, we conclude that the cellular roles of endogenous nek <dig> likely include regulation of ciliogenesis, possibly via effects on centrosome remodelling. we interpret the results of this study with caution because they are based exclusively on over-expression phenotypes of tissue culture cells. nevertheless, the pattern of phenotypes caused by the array of mutant forms of nek <dig> used in this work is informative. our data strongly indicate that the phenotypes are related to nek <dig> kinase activity. furthermore, the phenotypes are specific to over-expression of mnek <dig>  for example, over-expression of mnek <dig> does not affect ciliogenesis, centrosomes or cell cycle progression  <cit> . therefore, from the current work we conclude that an excess of nek <dig> kinase activity inhibits assembly of cilia. considering our data in the context of other studies  we further speculate that nek <dig> participates in signalling between the primary cilium and the nucleus and effects the coordination of ciliogenesis with cell cycle progression.
