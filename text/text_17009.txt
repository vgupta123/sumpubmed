BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small rna molecules of about  <dig> nucleotides that are negative regulators of protein expression. studies have shown that these small rnas are involved in the regulation of a variety of biological processes, including developmental timing, cell death, cell proliferation, haematopoiesis and patterning of nervous systems  <cit> . mirnas regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level  <cit>  by two modes. in the first model, mirnas bind to target transcripts by precise or near-precise pairing, leading to direct mrna cleavage and degradation through a mechanism involving the rna interference  machinery  <cit> . in the other model, the pairing of a mirna to its targets is usually less perfect, but still affects the mrnas' stability. targets are hence degraded by translational repression  <cit> . at the time of writing, mirbase  <cit> , which is the most comprehensive mirna repository, contains  <dig>  mirna entries from primates, rodents, birds, fish, worms, flies, plants, and viruses, among which  <dig> are human mirnas . recent work in computational prediction of mirna targets  <cit>  revealed that each human mirna could potentially target hundreds of genes and at least 30% of the human genes could be targeted by mirnas.

since  <dig> many computational approaches have been developed to predict mirna targets, some of them which are publicly available  <cit> . most of them rely on knowledge of the base pairing nature between the mirna and the target gene in animals and plants. the general idea is to find complementarity between the 3'-utr of the potential targets and mirnas, with emphasis on the critical pairing at the 5' end of the mirna  <cit> , which is often called the "seed" region. the conservation of the target 3'-utr sequences in orthologous genes, the kinetic and thermodynamics of the base pairing are also useful criteria. approaches differ in the methods used to measure conservation and to predict single  <cit>  or multiple  <cit>  binding sites in mirna targets, and in the statistical approaches chosen. position-based features, captured by machine learning classifiers, were also introduced in recent studies to model the shape and the mechanism of the seed pairing  <cit> .

in spite of its progress, computational prediction of mirna targets is still unreliable partly due to the lack of experimentally validated targets  <cit> . a recent study that compared some published methods for mammalian mirna targets prediction found that the overlap of identical predictions from the different computational approaches varied between 10% and 50% for a common set of  <dig> mirnas  <cit> . this indicates that false positive predictions could account for a large percentage of all the predicted mirna target genes and hence need to be filtered by a post-processing step.

here we present a machine-learning algorithm based on support vector machine  that can be used as a post-processing software for filtering the targets predicted by other mirna prediction tools. the prediction system is trained with the experimentally supported animal mirna targets found in tarbase  <cit> . each mirna:target interaction is mapped into a feature vector in a feature space. the feature space includes various k-gram  <cit>  frequencies in the interacting mirna:target pairs. we use a feature selection procedure to filter out those features with low discriminating abilities, resulting in feature space consisting of  <dig> features. support vector machines  are a class of supervised learning algorithms first introduced by vapnik  <cit> , and have been shown to produce superior results than other supervised learning methods in a wide range of applications. given a set of labeled training feature vectors , an svm learns to discriminate between the two classes. the result is a trained model that can be used to classify unlabeled inputs. our mirna target prediction system, named mirtif , achieves sensitivity and specificity of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the prediction system also produces a large auc of  <dig> , which provides a proper measure for the quality of the ranking of a classifier  <cit> . higher values of auc could be interpreted as an indication that positive samples are more likely to receive higher scores from the svm decision function than negative ones. this is a preferred behavior as it would be possible to rank the query samples according to their likelihood of being true positives. in addition, the majority of the negative mirna:target interactions  have been correctly predicted as false ones by mirtif, meaning the system did not simply classify all input samples as positive, as it might have been expected for a classifier trained with an un-balanced data. the potential problem of over-fitting has also been studied and ruled out by repeating the same training procedure using non-validated, randomly selected targets. we believe that mirtif can be used effectively as a post-processing filter for mirna:target interactions predicted by other methods that do not use training sets  <cit> . with an increasing set of experimentally validated positive and negative target, knowledge-based, machine-learning methods will certainly become more popular. mirtif can be accessed from .

the prediction accuracies of the ten-fold cross-validation are listed in table  <dig>  in the table, tp stands for true positive , fn for false negative , tn for true negative , and fp for false positive . the sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy of the 10-fold cross-validation are  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. auc has been shown to be a better measure than accuracy  <cit> , and our system produces a considerably high auc  <dig> .

current mirna target prediction methods are mostly based on similar characteristics of base pairing derived from lin- <dig> and let- <dig>  and their genetically validated mrna targets in c. elegans  <cit> . despite the fundamental similarities of those methods, many of their predictions are not in common. in addition, the prediction methods usually produce hundreds of targets for a given mirna, meaning a large number of them could be false positives. using the known mirna:target interaction pairs, our trained svm classifiers successfully predict most of the false positives:  <dig> out of the  <dig>  negative samples are correctly predicted to be false interactions. although this is at the expense of  <dig> incorrectly predicted positive samples, most of the positive samples  are correctly predicted.

informative features
the feature space used in current svm classification system includes various k-gram frequencies in the interacting mirna:target pairs . features are ranked according to their ability to discriminate positive and negative samples , and only those with high discriminating abilities are retained for svm training. these features are hence termed "informative features". table  <dig> lists the  <dig> most informative features, their means, standard deviations and f scores. see methods for the calculation of f scores.

                              σ

                              f
features are in the format of k-gram type, region, and k-gram code. for example, "3-gram, non-seed, mismatch/au/au" represent a mismatch followed by an au pair followed by an au pair in the non-seed region . for each feature, its means and standard deviations in both positive and negative sets are listed. the f score is defined as |/|, which measures the discriminating ability of the feature.

it is worth noting that almost all the  <dig> most informative features in table  <dig> come from either the non-seed region or the entire duplex . for example, two of the interesting features, the gap frequencies in the non-seed region and the entire region , differ considerably between the positive and the negative samples. we suspect that a highly discriminative k-gram code in the non-seed region makes some contribution to the discriminating ability of the same k-gram code in the entire region; otherwise we would have observed a high f score for this k-gram code in the seed region. this observation hints the potential importance of the k-gram frequencies in the non-seed region in discriminating positive and negative mirna:target interaction pairs. in fact, among the  <dig> most informative features, non-seed region features account for  <dig>  entire region features account for  <dig>  whereas seed region features only account for  <dig>  it again shows that many of the highly informative features lie within the non-seed region.

discussion
to study the potential over-fitting problem due to the relatively small number of training samples , we took non-validated targets from mirbase  <cit>   and randomly partitioned them into sets of  <dig> and  <dig>  those targets come from the predictions for the mirnas listed in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  non-validated targets were taken this way. we repeated the random partitioning, i.e., selecting  <dig> and  <dig> samples out of the  <dig>  non-validated targets,  <dig>  times. for each randomly partitioned 195/ <dig> data set, we performed the same feature filtering and svm parameter optimizing steps. each random data set was tested by ten-fold cross validation using the optimal svm parameters. the averaged auc was  <dig>  with a standard deviation of  <dig> , a considerable drop comparing with the auc of  <dig>  using the experimentally validated tarbase samples. this result suggests that over-fitting may not be a severe problem otherwise we would have seen equally high auc values using non-validated targets as the training set.

mirtif should not be considered as a general tool for mirna target prediction. it is rather a post-processing filter for the mirna:target interactions predicted by other seed-sensitive computational methods. because mirtif is trained on validated mirna:target duplexes, both positive and negative training duplexes possess the known mirna:target binding properties such as the strong seed complementarity and high binding energy. a random duplex  without prescreening by those seed-sensitive programs is not the ideal candidates for using mirtif.

machine learning techniques such as naïve bayes and svm have been previously applied to the mirna target prediction problem  <cit> . unlike mirtif, mitarget  <cit>  and nbmirtar  <cit>  are general target prediction tools . the svm-based mitarget could not easily impose criteria other than features embedded in the encoded duplex. for example, features such as species conservation and the over-representation of conserved adenosines flanking the seed complementary sites  <cit>  are difficult to implement into an svm feature vector. being a post-processing filter, on the other hand, mirtif takes in predicted duplexes from other programs and the abovementioned features are already taken into consideration by these prediction tools. the work by yan et al.  <cit>  is an ensemble machine learning application that helps to predict mirna targets. an ensemble algorithm is the one that runs several different algorithms and summarize their outputs to generate the final output. in  <cit> , the ensemble algorithm consists of a naïve bayes, a neural network, a decision tree and an svm algorithm.

the lack of validated negative mirna:target interaction remains a problem for machine learning-based target prediction approach. for example, the training set of the ensemble algorithm  <cit>  contains only  <dig> negative samples, in addition to  <dig> positive ones. moreover, sethupathy et al. pointed out that only two out of the  <dig> or so experimentally refuted mirna:target interactions for mammals listed in tarbase are unbiased with respect to various prediction programs  <cit> . with such a limited number of negative samples, researchers have to rely on artificially generated negative mirna:target interactions. in nbmirtar  <cit> , for example, negative mirna:target interactions were produced by using artificially generated mirnas and their putative targets predicted by miranda  <cit> . the putative targets are believed to be false positive predictions because the query mirnas are not true. in our study, the potential over-fitting problem due to the lack of sufficient positive and negative samples is addressed by repeating the same training procedure using non-validated, randomly selected targets. as described in results, the validation for randomly selected target genes suggests that over-fitting may not be a severe problem otherwise we would have seen equally high auc values using non-validated targets as the training set.

in our study, the validated mirna:target interactions and the associated binding patterns were retrieved from tarbase, which obtained their information from respective original research papers. although the duplexes were generated by different prediction tools, many of the duplexes have at least their seed regions experimentally validated. in comparison with mitarget, where the binding patterns were re-computed using rnafold  <cit>  by the author themselves, we believe that our way of taking samples from tarbase remains to be a better approach for a post-processing mirna target prediction tool, since otherwise we would have to require all potential users of mirtif to prepare the duplexes using rnafold.

one of selection criteria employed by many mirna target prediction algorithms such as targetscans  <cit> , pictar  <cit>  and miranda  <cit>  is the perfect or near perfect seed complementarity. as a result, those mirna:target interactions that are later proven to be negative also have strong seed complementarity as the positive ones do. this explains why most of the highly informative features are within the non-seed region .

the current collection of experimentally validated mirna:target interaction pairs is still far from being sufficiently comprehensive to give an accurate representation of the target site diversity. problems with limited dataset can be observed in table  <dig>  where nine of the  <dig> features have  <dig> mean and standard deviation in the negative sets. for example, the 3-gram code "mismatch/au/au" in the non-seed region, which ranks number  <dig> in the list, does not appear in the negative set. limited training sets may have problems to distinguish highly homogenous compositions, and hence restrict the types of sites that can be predicted. this problem was also pointed out in the tarbase paper  <cit> . here we provide the list of mirnas used for the svm training . the  <dig> positive mirna:target interaction pairs contain  <dig> mirnas, while the  <dig> negative samples contain  <dig> mirnas. since the performance of mirtif on other mirnas cannot be tested, table  <dig> should provide users a guide about the applicability of mirtif. with so many mirna research works going on worldwide, we expect a rapid increase in the experimentally validated target sites. mirtif, hence, will be updated periodically to provide mirna target filtering service with an up to date coverage of the validated target sites.

to demonstrate how mirtif is applied in real world, table  <dig> lists a comparison between mirtif and three ab initio target prediction software programs, pictar, mirbase and targetscan. here the example mirna is hsa-mir- <dig>  this mirna is the most significantly up-regulated mirnas in hepatocellular carcinoma patients  <cit> . the mirtif discriminant scores were suggested to the experimental biologists working on the mir- <dig> project along with the predictions made by pictar, mirbase and targetscan. among the predictions, the apoptosis inhibitor- <dig>  was experimentally validated as a mir- <dig> specific target  <cit> . we believe that the value of mirtif's resides in that it provides an additional suggestion to experimental biologists when choosing targets to validate.

ranking indicates the rank predicted by respective software program. "na" indicates that the particular program did not produce an interaction between the corresponding target gene and mir- <dig>  for the discriminant scores under mirtif, positive scores indicate true predictions while negative scores negative predictions. the score is proportional to the sample's distance from the hyperplane. so a large positive value implies high confidence that the sample lies in the positive class.

CONCLUSIONS
we built an svm classifier serving as a post-processing filter for mirna target prediction. the system, mirtif, takes the targets predicted by other target prediction tools as the input and reports the svm scores indicting the likelihood of them being true mirna targets. tested with the experimentally validated mirna targets found in tarbase using ten-fold cross validation, the obtained high auc measurement  indicates that true positives are indeed ranked higher than false ones. with more biologically validated mirna:target duplexes in the future, the accuracy increase of knowledge-based, machine-learning approaches such as mirtif could be anticipated.
