BACKGROUND
mycorrhizal association between plants and fungi is a common phenomenon in plants. in fact, most orchid species depend on interactions with mycorrhizal fungi for completing their life cycle, particularly during their early developmental stages because orchids lack endosperm or seed-based nutrient reserves  <cit> . some orchid species are achlorophyllous through their entire life and must obtain carbon and nutrients for their growth and survival through mycorrhizal fungi  <cit> . it has been suggested that fully mycoheterotrophic orchids often show high specificity toward their mycorrhizal fungi  <cit> . conversely, mycorrhizal association may vary in photosynthetic orchids  <cit> . thus, identifying mycorrhizal fungi that are important for the survival and growth of mycoheterotrophic orchids may provide insights into the evolutionary dynamics between orchids and their fungal associates.

gastrodia species form one of the largest achlorophyllous and mycoheterotrophic orchid genera, and are distributed throughout oceania to asia, including australia, vietnam, china, taiwan, japan and south korea  <cit> . the rhizomes of gastrodia elata are a prominent herbal medicine for human diseases such as vertigo, blackout and headache  <cit> . it has been suggested that g. elata depends on mycena fungi for germination  <cit>  and relies on armillaria fungi for carbon and nutritional supply after germination  <cit> . in addition, some gastrodia species are associated with litter- or wood-decaying fungi  <cit> . ogura-tsujita et al. first demonstrated that the adult g. confusa gain carbon through several wood- or litter-decaying mycena species  <cit> . in contrast, g. similis was found to be associated largely with the saprotrophic resinicium fungi  <cit> . moreover, g. sesamoides, a common obligate mycoheterotrophic orchid species, relies on the saprotrophic fungi campanella and marasmius for its carbon supply instead of on an ectomycorrhizal fungal partner of a photosynthetic plant  <cit> . the above four gastrodia species all depend on saprotrophic fungi for carbon and nutrition regardless of their geographic regions. in this study, we examined the fungal composition in the tubers of g. flavilabella, an endemic species of taiwan  <cit> , to identify the predominant fungi species associated with this plant. the identification is important because gastrodia species do not always associate with the same fungal species for their growth.

concurrent association of several fungi with an individual orchid is common, especially in photosynthetic orchids  <cit> , suggesting the importance of studying the whole community of mycorrhizal fungi rather than the presence of individual fungal species. however, current mycorrhizal fungi identification requires microscopic identification and culturing or dna segment cloning/sequencing, which may not provide sufficient resolution for the whole fungal community in the plant  <cit> . in this study, we used a deep sequencing approach to investigate the fungal community structure in the tubers of g. flavilabella and in the surrounding soil. we also investigated if g. flavilabella is preferentially associated with certain fungi.

environmental and ecological factors may affect the extent of mycorrhizal preference of plant and the degree of dependence of plant on fungi for carbon and nutrients  <cit> . for example, the habitat characteristics and the presence of mycorrhizal fungi are important factors for the distribution of the orchid cypripedium californicum because c. californicum is associated with multiple fungal families and may switch among different mycorrhizal fungi relatively easily  <cit> . in addition, mccormick et al. showed that the distribution of a mycoheterotrophic orchid, corallorhiza odontorhiza, and three green orchids correlated strongly with the abundance of the required mycorrhizal fungi  <cit> . thus, we also asked if the preferential fungal association of g. flavilabella is influenced by the fungal composition of the environment and/or by other environmental factors.

RESULTS
fungal samples and the 28s rdna sequences
to study the fungal communities in g. flavilabella, we collected five tuber samples  and five soil samples from their surrounding soil  . from the genomic dnas of each sample, the 28s rdna segments were amplified and the pcr products were subjected to illumina paired-end  sequencing . there were at least  <dig>  pe reads for each of the ten tuber and soil samples . after merging pe reads and selecting high-quality merged reads , about  <dig>  or more reads were obtained for analyzing each sample. the merged pe reads were deposited in ncbi sra database under the sra id srp <dig>  for all samples expect the fla <dig> samples, ~60% of the data were of high-quality . the lower percentages of high-quality merged reads in the fla <dig> tuber and soil samples could be attributed to the shorter read length and lower sequencing quality. the length of the fla <dig> paired reads  only allowed merged reads of size up to 190 bp, while the merged reads of other fla samples could go up to 260 bp. in terms of mean quality, the fla <dig> tuber and soil samples were the lowest at the tails of both paired reads . note that our soil samples contained higher fractions of long amplicons  than the tuber samples . because the fla <dig> data did not allow long merged reads, we expected a lower percentage of merged reads in the fla <dig> soil data than in the fla <dig> tuber data; this was indeed the case .figure  <dig>

taxonomic classification of the amplicon data
we used a blast-based nearest neighbor approach for taxonomic classification of the merged reads, i.e., amplicon sequences . to prepare a reference database,  <dig> lsu sequences were collected from ncbi , of which  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were fungi, metazoan, and viridiplantae, respectively. based on the alignment results, our fungal specific lsu primers not only captured the 28s rdnas of fungi, but also those of viridiplantae and metazoan . as expected, the percentages  of viridiplantae sequences in the tuber samples were higher than those  in the soil samples . most of the viridiplantae sequences in the fla tuber samples were classified into the same family of orchidaceae , and they likely corresponded to the g. flavilabella sequences . in all the soil samples except fla <dig>  the percentages of metazoan sequences were higher than those in the tuber samples. in the tuber samples, the non-zero percentages of metazoan sequences suggest the presence of metazoa in the tubers and/or contamination. however, even if contamination occurred, the extent was relatively small and should not alter our major findings . note that some of the lsu references were not classified at all the seven taxonomic levels, which explained most of the unclassified sequences. the high percentage  of unclassified reads suggested a large fraction of novel species in the soil samples. in the following, we focused only on the fungal reads.table  <dig>

comparison of fungal communities by amplicon size distribution
our fungal specific primers were designed to amplify a variable region of lsu rdna sequence. the amplified fungal 28s rdna fragments were expected to be 167–218 bp in size. most of the fungal amplicons of all the tuber samples were in the range of 175–180 bp and showed a single major peak at size of 179 bp . in contrast, the fungal amplicons of the soil samples were in the range of 162–200 bp and showed several major peaks. compared to the tuber samples, the broader spectrum of amplicon sizes of the soil samples indicated greater fungal diversity in the soil surrounding the plants.figure  <dig>

highly diversified fungal communities in tubers and the surrounding soil
it has been suggested that achlorophyllous orchids often show high specificity to their mycorrhizal fungi and mycorrhizal association may vary in photosynthetic orchids  <cit> . to study fungal diversity in the tubers and the surrounding soil, we examined the fungal communities by amplicon sequences. before analyzing the fungal communities, we removed singletons and chimeric reads using the uparse pipeline . this removed  <dig> - <dig> % of the amplicons of tuber samples and  <dig> - <dig> % of the amplicons of the soil samples. for each sample, we clustered similar amplicon sequences into operational taxonomic units  by uparse using a default setting of 97% sequence similarity. we found 82– <dig> and 945– <dig> otus in the g. flavilabella tubers and the surrounding soil, respectively . the numbers of otus were closer to saturation for the tuber samples than for the soil samples . thus, the fungal diversity of the soil was underestimated. it is likely that we also have underestimated the fungi diversity in the tubers of g. flavilabella because some of the filtered singletons might be authentic. in any case, the clearly larger numbers of otus in the soil indicated more complex fungal communities in the soil . note that the majority of the otus in the tubers were not abundant . however, two to seven otus in the tubers occupied more than 1% of the fungal community, indicating concurrent association of several fungal species in the tubers of g. flavilabella.table  <dig>

fungal communities in the tubers and the soil are different
we examined if the fungal communities of the tubers are influenced by the fungal communities of the soil. to this end, the representative sequences of otus of all samples were gathered and the distances between the fungal communities were measured by unifrac . the distances were visualized after principal component analysis . the first two principal axes of the weighted analysis, i.e., considering otu abundance, captured  <dig> % of the data variance. as shown in figure 4a, all the soil samples formed a cluster, indicating a certain degree similarity of the fungal communities in the soil of the area. the fungal communities of all the tuber samples also formed a group, which could be divided into two subgroups: fla <dig>  and fla <dig> , <dig>  this indicated different fungal communities in the plants of the two subgroups. moreover, the fungal communities in nearby soil could change quickly with distance, as the fungal communities of the fla <dig> and fla <dig> soil samples  did not cluster together. so far, we observed that  the fungal communities in the tubers were different from those in the soil,  fungal communities in tubers at different locations were similar and  the fungal communities in soil could change quickly with distance.figure  <dig>

fungal communities and compositions in the tubers and the soil
to identify the fungal species in the tuber and soil samples, we examined the taxonomies of the otus of all the ten tuber and soil samples. we used a blast-based nearest neighbor approach for classifying the otus’ representative sequences. at the phylum level, the percentages  of basidiomycota fungi in all tuber samples were higher than those  in the soil samples . conversely, the percentages of ascomycota fungi in all tuber samples except fla <dig> were lower compared to the corresponding soil. in addition, the percentages of the next three abundant phyla in all tuber samples were lower than those in the soil samples. most  of the basidiomycota fungi in the tuber samples were from the class agaricomycetes, whereas the ascomycota fungi split into several classes . similar trends were observed in the soil samples, but  <dig> - <dig> % of the basidiomycota fungi in the soil did not belong to the agaricomycetes. at the order level, the overall fungal compositions were similar to those at the phylum level. for example, most of the agaricomycetes in the fla tubers were agaricales species. such a nearly monocomponent of taxonomy at the lower taxonomic ranks continued to the family and genus levels for most of fla tuber samples except for the fla <dig> tuber sample, where most of the abundant otus were unclassified below the order level. these otus were unclassified beyond the order level mainly because the sequences were aligned equally well to more than one reference, which carried different taxonomic classifications .figure  <dig> 
fungal compositions in tuber samples and the surrounding soil samples at six taxonomic levels. at each level, we selected the  <dig> most abundant taxonomies  based on the mean percentage across all samples and stacked them from bottom to top. the remaining classifications were lumped into “others”. the parts between the stack top and 100% were constituted by unclassified reads. sample id suffix: _t, tuber; _s, soil



at all taxonomic levels, especially the lower ones, the fungal composition between a tuber sample and the corresponding soil sample was apparently different . this and the following observation were consistent with figure  <dig>  first, the fungal communities of the fla <dig>  fla <dig>  and fla <dig> tuber samples were more similar to each other than to the fla <dig> and fla <dig> tuber samples. second, among the soil samples, fla <dig> and fla <dig> showed more similar fungal compositions compared to other samples. third, the fungal communities of soil were more complex than those observed in the tubers. compared to the tuber samples, the higher percentages of unclassified amplicons in the soil samples might indicate a large fraction of novel fungal species in the soil.

mycena species are the predominant fungi in g. flavilabella
the species closely related to mycena cf. quiniaultensis osc  <dig> constituted  <dig> - <dig> % of the fungi communities in the fla <dig>  fla <dig>  and fla <dig> tuber samples . in the fla <dig> tuber sample,  <dig> % of fungi communities were mycena species, of which  <dig> % and  <dig> % were closely related to mycena cf. quiniaultensis osc  <dig> and mycena chlorophos, respectively. thus, mycena species were the predominant fungi in the g. flavilabella, except that only  <dig> % of mycena species were in the fla <dig> tuber sample . note that the taxonomy of some abundant otus did not appear in figure  <dig> when they were unclassified at the taxonomic level . take fla <dig> tuber sample for example, the most abundant otu  was classified as the agaricales; however, it was perfectly aligned to  <dig> different mycena species and  <dig> non-mycena species. that is, the most abundant otu in the fla <dig> tuber might still be mycena species, but they were surely distinct from mycena cf. quiniaultensis osc  <dig>  our data also suggested that the predominance of mycena fungi in the g. flavilabella tubers was not influenced by the fungal composition of the environment because the percentages  of mycena fungi in all soil samples were much lower than those in the tuber samples .

discussion
preferential association between mycena fungi and g. flavilabella
based on the clear distinction between the fungal communities in the g. flavilabella tubers and those in the surrounding soil , we proposed that specific fungal communities had developed in the tubers of g. flavilabella. moreover, the species closely related to mycena cf. quiniaultensis osc  <dig>  was the predominant fungus in g. flavilabella tubers because it constituted  <dig> - <dig> % of the fungi communities in the fla <dig>  fla <dig>  and fla <dig> tuber samples, but only a small fraction in all the soil samples . interestingly, some differences were observed among the tubers. for example, mycena species closely related to mycena cf. quiniaultensis osc  <dig> or mycena chlorophos were the top abundant fungi in the fla <dig> tuber sample, while other mycena and non-mycena species were abundant in the fla <dig> tuber sample. however, since they are all mycena fungi, we concluded that adult g. flavilabella has a strong preference for association with mycena fungi.

the highly diversified fungi in the tubers of g. flavilabella suggested that g. flavilabella does not have a strong defense mechanism to prevent fungal invasion and this perhaps reflects a fully mycoheterotrophic orchid’s nature to exploit any possible nutrient source. but why did the preference of g. flavilabella for mycena fungi occur? it is possible that mycena fungi were the first few fungi that invaded the tubers of g. flavilabella and g. flavilabella had since became dependent on mycena fungi. it is also possible that the preference developed simply because mycena fungi are saprotrophic and can provide g. flavilabella suitable nutrients. on the other hand, g. flavilabella might have changed its physiology to provide a stable environment for mycena species or g. flavilabella might be able to stimulate the growth of mycena species as has been observed in some mycorrhizal fungi  <cit> .

association of saprotrophic fungi with g. flavilabella
to date, achlorophyllous orchids were the only plants reported to solely rely on the saprotrophic fungi for carbon and nutrition  <cit> . most of the mycoheterotrophic plant associated mycorrhizal fungi also form symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic plants, so that many mycoheterotrophic plants may also obtain carbon and nutrients from surrounding photosynthetic plants through ectomycorrhizal fungi  <cit> . ogura-tsujita et al. reported that g. confusa is associated with several mycena species and obtains carbon from these saprotrophic fungi but not from the surrounding photosynthetic plants  <cit> . it has been suggested that adult g. elata depends on armillaria species for nutritional supply and can be cultivated without photosynthetic plants  <cit> . now, there is more evidence that gastrodia species is associated with litter- or wood-decaying fungi such as resinicium, campanella and marasmius species for carbon and nutrients  <cit> . we found that g. flavilabella has preferential association with mycena fungi, and possibly also with dictyopanus, mycenoporella, favolaschia, panellus, cruentomycena, and resinomycena fungi. association of these litter- or wood-decaying saprotrophic fungi suggested that g. flavilabella is a fully mycoheterotrophic orchid that does not rely on photosynthetic plants. however, we cannot rule out that g. flavilabella also obtains nutrients from surrounding photosynthetic plants.

environmental factors might affect the fungal communities of tubers and the surrounding soil
although the fla <dig> and fla <dig> plants were only ~ <dig>  meters apart , the fungal communities in the two soil samples were not the most similar among the soil samples, indicating that the fungal communities in soil could change quickly with distance . however, the fungal communities of the fla <dig> and fla <dig> soil did cluster together in unweighted analysis, which considered only the identity but not the quantity of species . thus, the identities of microbes could be similar in a nearby region but their abundances could change quickly even in only  <dig>  meters apart. as soil nutrient content could influence the abundance of soil microbes  <cit> , we suspected that the slight difference of the microenvironment such as composition of nutrients could affect the abundance of fungi in the soil. it is likely that the environmental factors could also affect the fungal communities of g. flavilabella tubers. indeed, environmental factors such as soil moisture, organic content, and total nitrogen content in fla <dig>  fla <dig> and fla <dig> soil samples were rather similar, which might explain the similarity among the fungal communities in fla <dig>  fla <dig> and fla <dig> tubers . in addition, the clustering of fungal communities in the tubers was different from that of the soil , indicating that the fungal community in a fla tuber was not strongly influenced by the fungal community of the surrounding soil. therefore, environmental factors such as water and nutrient content of the soil apparently have greater impacts on the fungal communities of tubers than the fungal communities of soil did.table  <dig>

metazoa in the orchid samples
metazoa can infect plants with no mutual benefits, leading to plant parasitism. for example, the nematode meloidogyne incognita can invade the roots of almost all cultivated plants  <cit>  and induce the re-differentiation of root cells  <cit> . many herbivore insects are also plant parasites and some arthropods can live within plants; e.g., phylloxera is an endo-parasite of grapes  <cit> . it is thus not peculiar to observe metazoan sequences in our tuber samples. among the metazoan sequences in our fla tuber samples, nematodes and arthropods were the two major phyla in most cases .

the metazoan sequences might be in part due to contamination from the surrounding soil. in this scenario, we expected the metazoan community in the fla tubers to be, to some extent, similar to that in the surrounding soil. however, the fla <dig>  fla <dig>  and fla <dig> tubers did not cluster with the surrounding soil in unifrac analysis . when focusing on the identities of metazoa, i.e., unweighted analysis, only the fla <dig> tuber and soil samples clustered together . thus, contamination should not be a major concern. interestingly, we did not observe a common pattern of metazoan compositions in the fla tubers, indicating no host specificity for metazoans.

lsu database
lsu sequences have been collected in the databases rdp  <cit>  and silva  <cit> . however, we decided to curate our own lsu sequences because many lsu sequences in ncbi were not included in these databases. the rdp database  provides  <dig>  fungal specific 28s rdna sequences, so that they can not be used to classify non-fungi amplicons. in contrast, silva contains many non-fungal sequences but relatively few fungal sequences. among the  <dig>  lsu sequences in silva ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  belong to fungi, metazoa and viridiplantae, respectively. in contrast, we collected  <dig>  lsu sequences, of which  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  were fungi, metazoan and viridiplantae, respectively. our more comprehensive lsu references allowed us to infer taxonomy with a higher accuracy. note that some of our lsu sequences were not classified at all the seven taxonomic levels and some were only partial 28s rdna sequences. this is perhaps one reason why other databases do not collect such sequences. nevertheless, incomplete information was better than missing information and the partial 28s rdna sequences were useful for our analysis.

taxonomy classification
several computational tools, e.g., rdp classifier  <cit> , greengenes classifier  <cit>  based on nast alignments  <cit>  and the blast-based method  <cit> , have been proposed for taxonomic classification. the blast-based method was shown comparable to rdp classifier and greengenes classifier in terms of internal consistency of taxonomic assignments, but was less sensitive than greengenes  <cit> . at the time of this study, nast was not available. moreover, greengenes was only available as a web-server and thus could not accommodate our large datasets. we had tried the rdp classifier, but found some practical challenges. first, the rdp classifier requires references to have complete taxonomy classifications from domain to genus. this immediately dismissed those perfectly aligned or highly identical references that had missing taxonomy information. second, the reference sequences of rdp classifier were not comparable to our amplicons in length. our blast-based nearest neighbor approach classified most  of the good-quality merged tuber amplicons to fungi, metazoa or viridiplantae . although  <dig> - <dig> % of the soil amplicons could not be classified to fungi, metazoa or viridiplantae, those unclassified amplicons in the soil samples might correspond to the novel species in the soil.

confidence of taxonomy classification
our own lsu references were still not sufficient for giving all the sequences the right classification. for example, most of the viridiplantae amplicons in all tuber samples were classified as “viridiplantae; streptophyta; liliopsida; asparagales; orchidaceae; campylocentrum; campylocentrum micranthum” instead of being g. flavilabella. this was the result of no gastrodia lsu sequence in the ncbi database. the classification, however, was reasonable because gastrodia belongs to the orchidaceae family. moreover, the alignment identity of the corresponding otu representative to the campylocentrum micranthum reference was only  <dig> % .

the otu representative classified as mycena cf. quiniaultensis osc  <dig> was  <dig> % identical to the corresponding reference sequence . a similar observation was made for the otu classified as mycena chlorophos, the third most abundant otu in the fla <dig> tuber sample. in the fla <dig> tuber sample, the three most abundant otus were classified as agaricales, agaricomycetes and ascomycota fungi, respectively, but were aligned to multiple taxonomic groups at the family or higher level. for example, the most abundant otu was classified as agaricales fungi; however, the otu representative was perfectly aligned to  <dig> different mycena species and  <dig> non-mycena species. moreover, none of the best alignments were to the mycena cf. quiniaultensis osc  <dig>  indicating that the dominating mycena species in the fla <dig> tuber sample was different from those in other fla tuber samples. the taxonomic classification for the second and third most abundant otus were agaricomycetes and ascomycota fungi; however, none of the best alignments was to the tricholomataceae family, indicating non-mycena species of these two otus. we emphasized again that our blast-based nearest neighbor approach to species classifications might not be  <dig> percent correct if the species sequence information in the database was missing or not correct. however, it is certain that the sequences classified differently, e.g., as mycena cf. quiniaultensis osc  <dig> and mycena chlorophos, were distinct, thus truly representing different species.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study using a ngs deep sequencing approach for identifying the fungal communities in the tubers of g. flavilabella and in the surrounding soil. we found highly diversified fungal communities in the tubers, and mycena species were the predominant fungi in the tubers of g. flavilabella, indicating that the mycoheterotrophic g. flavilabella has a preferential association with saprotrophic mycena fungi. so far, it has been shown that gastrodia species such as g. elata, g. confuse, g. similis and g. sesamoides are associated with litter- or wood-decaying fungi such as armillaria, mycena, resinicium, campanella and marasmius species for carbon and nutrients  <cit> . finally, the environmental factors such as soil water and nutrient contents might have a greater impact on the fungal communities in the tubers than the fungal communities in the soil.
