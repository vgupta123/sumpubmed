BACKGROUND
micrornas are an abundant group of small rnas with length ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides, averaging  <dig> nucleotides, and performing post-transcriptional regulation of the expression of genes involved in a wide variety of biological processes. the complex biogenesis of mature mirnas has recently been reviewed  <cit> . sequences of more than  <dig> mirnas have been deposited in the mirbase database  <cit> , the majority of them having been discovered by traditional cloning approach. bioinformatics predictions with experimental validation indicate that the total number of mirnas is significantly higher than previously estimated  <cit> . it is essential to characterize the whole repertoire of mirnas and to fully understand their integrated expression patterns. the next-generation sequencing  techniques enable these efforts with lower cost and have been applied in mirnas studies in many species of animals, plants and viruses.

sample preparation is of major importance for ngs and assessing the quality of a library preparation by cloning validation before sequencing is necessary  <cit> . different commercial protocols for mirna library preparation have been developed. illumina, inc. published a mirna sample preparation protocol  for sbs sequencing in  <dig>  which requires a minimum of  <dig> days of procedure. in  <dig> illumina, inc. proposed an alternative protocol  which only requires one day of sample preparation. applied biosystems, inc. developed a mirna library preparation protocol for the solid  system, also requiring one day procedure, but its adapter ligation principle is based on hybridization. these protocols can be applied in all current sequencing techniques though the downstream procedures can be variable.

the cloning frequency of an individual mirna should generally reflect its relative abundance in a sample, and the novel ngs methods offering a much richer source of sequence information should provide more accurate quantitative expression measurements  <cit> . however, in reality biases caused by sample preparation cannot be avoided, sometimes leading to inaccurate conclusions. a systematic bias in the cloning protocol has previously been detected: mirna clone counts did not correlate well with their concentrations in the pool  <cit> . biased cloning efficiencies were also observed for two different mirnas from the same cluster, leading to discrepancies between cloning frequency and small rna blot results  <cit> .

different protocols of library preparation may influence the cloning frequency significantly. the adapter ligation efficiency can be affected by the 5'- and 3'-end nucleotides or the secondary structure of mirnas, and the number of polymerase chain reaction cycles or gel isolation procedures may also influence the results. in this article we compared sequencing data of libraries constructed by the above-mentioned three different protocols, and validated some results by qrt-pcr using stem-loop primers  <cit> . bias of length, sequence variation, and ess were observed for all three protocols. based on our data, we suggest that methods such as solid and qrt-pcr, based on hybridization, may provide better quantitative measurement of mirna abundance.

RESULTS
statistics for cloning and illumina sbs sequencing libraries
we assessed the quality of libraries by cloning and a sanger sequencing approach.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> high quality reads were obtained for hu sheep libraries constructed by solid, illumina v <dig> and illumina v <dig>  protocols, respectively.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> high quality reads were obtained for dorper sheep using solid, illumina v <dig> and illumina v <dig>  protocols, respectively. the ratio of reads mapping to known micrornas, rrnas, and mrnas, and the reads which have not been mapped to any known sequences, were compared between the different protocols .

the libraries constructed from dorper sheep and hu sheep, using the illumina v <dig> protocol, were used for illumina sbs sequencing. about  <dig> million raw reads were obtained for each library. eighty-four percent of the hu sheep reads mapped to known ovis aries sequences and  <dig>  were unique reads for hu sheep. concerning dorper sheep, 82% of the reads could map to known ovis aries sequences, and  <dig>  unique reads were observed. about  <dig>  and  <dig>  million reads were obtained after adapter removing for dorper sheep and hu sheep respectively. of these reads 82% and 84%, respectively, have previously been annotated as either known rnas , repeat regions, or are contained within the boundaries of protein coding genes for dorper sheep and hu sheep. the number of reads that were annotated as known micrornas was  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> for dorper sheep and hu sheep respectively.

length distribution for libraries
the length distribution of all cloning and sbs sequencing data was assessed . they follow a gaussian-like distribution with the mean set at  <dig> nt. kurtosis of each distribution curve varies according to the protocols. the solid protocol covers a wider range of length, as the gradient of the distribution curve is flatter. the illumina protocols have intensive enriching effects for  <dig> nt mirnas, the v <dig> protocol showing the highest effect. a more strict length distribution may be obtained by introducing additional gel purification steps in the protocols. length distribution of illumina genome analyzer  data  coincided with illumina v <dig> cloning data as the same library preparation protocol was used.

different protocols generate different bias of sequence variation and end secondary structure 
the sequence variations of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in our data were assessed by weblogo tool . the sequences obtained by solid cloning display a higher diversity than the ones from illumina. we observed obvious higher-frequency variation of nucleotides near 3'-end sites. the adenine and thymine at the 3'-end of mir- <dig> were truncated in the majority of solid cloning sequences. variations of 5'-end nucleotides were also found in solid cloning data, but were rare in all the data from illumina protocols. comparing the sequences obtained by the two illumina protocol versions, we observed a generally high conservatism, though nucleotides near the 3'-end showed slightly more diversity using illumina v <dig>  protocol.

the  <dig>   <dig> sites of mir- <dig> have lower conservatism and more diversity for solid cloning sequences , this phenomenon can also be observed at the  <dig>   <dig> sites of mir- <dig> in solid data, but not in illumina's . the sites listed above all locate near the 3'-end, however, the sites near the 5'-end indicated high conservatism for both solid and illumina data. diversity of these sites near the 3'-end may be caused by the hybridization-based adapter ligation in the solid protocol.

bias of ess for mir- <dig> sequences were observed between solid and illumina protocols . the presence of ess at 5'- or 3'-ends was highly uneven. the frequency of 5'-ess was much lower than 3'-ess for mir- <dig> sequences, which may be due to lower-frequency variation in 5'-end sequences. in the solid cloning data 75% and 80% of the mir- <dig> sequences contained 3'-ess for dorper sheep and hu sheep, respectively. conversely, the 3'-ess sequences accounted for less than 15% of the illumina data. 5'-ess sequences were rather rare in the illumina ga data , and were absent in the illumina cloning data with the two version protocols due to limited counts of reads, but 5'-ess accounted for 10% and  <dig> % for solid cloning data of hu sheep and dorper sheep, respectively. the solid data contained significantly more ess than illumina's, which may be caused by an enrichment effect on ess using the solid protocol, or an enrichment effect on non-ess using the illumina protocol.

bias of ess also existed between the two versions of illumina protocols . data acquired with the v <dig>  protocol contained more than 10% 3'-ess for mir- <dig> sequences, while the data of the v <dig> protocol did not contain any ess for mir- <dig> sequences.

relative abundance of mirnas varied for different protocols
we sorted the reads mapping to known micrornas into different families, assessing the read counts of each mirna family by correlative analysis. for dorper sheep, we obtained sequences from  <dig> mirna families for illumina sbs sequencing while only  <dig> families were observed when combining the results from the three libraries for cloning and sanger sequencing , indicating a high depth of sbs sequencing. the  <dig> families mentioned above were analyzed in sbs and sanger sequencing data, and the same procedure was used for hu sheep. the sequencing data all correlate significantly, but the correlation coefficients varied for different protocols. the correlation coefficients between solid and illumina data were the lowest, regardless of sbs or sanger sequencing, and the illumina ga data correlated best with illumina cloning data because the same protocol was used  .

correlation coefficients between qrt-pcr and sequencing data were calculated by the data listed in additional file  <dig>  correlation coefficients between different sequencing data were calculated by the data listed in additional file  <dig> 

a relatively higher frequency of sequences that do not map to known mirnas was observed for solid cloning data , including the sequences mapping to mrnas, repeats, or rrna genes, and sequences that do not map to any known sequences .

qrt-pcr results correlate the best with solid cloning data
the relative abundance of  <dig> mirnas calculated by qrt-pcr was compared with the read counts of the same families in sequencing data. the muscle-specific mirnas, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  were the two most abundant mirnas as analyzed by qrt-pcr, and confirmed by sequencing data, as well as by a previous report  <cit> . sequencing and qrt-pcr data all significantly correlated, displaying correlation coefficients above  <dig>  . correlation coefficients between solid cloning data and qrt-pcr were the highest  . the correlation between illumina ga data and qrt-pcr were also excellent . the high correlation between data from qrt-pcr and solid protocol may be explained by the similar principle of hybridization between the mirna templates and the stem-loop primers or the adapter mix.

fold difference analysis between hu sheep and dorper sheep using qrt-pcr and sequencing
except for mir-486-5p, the mirnas assessed showed a similar orientation of fold change using qrt-pcr or illumina ga . the correlation coefficient between the fold difference of the  <dig> mirnas calculated by qrt-pcr and illumina ga was  <dig> . fold difference of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> for cloning data using different protocols were compared with sbs sequencing data and qrt-pcr . fold difference of mir- <dig> was inverted for illumina v <dig>  cloning data, and fold difference of mir- <dig> could not be detected by cloning using illumina v <dig> protocol. for solid cloning data, the fold difference of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> was similar with illumina ga data and qrt-pcr, indicating relatively more accurate quantitative measurement for mirna abundance of the solid protocol.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we assessed three different protocols of mirna library construction using cloning or sbs sequencing, and validated our results by qrt-pcr. sbs sequencing provided a high-throughput and deep measurement for mirna expression, while the sequencing depth of cloning was much lower, though a concatemerization cloning strategy was developed  <cit> . sbs sequencing data correlated better with qrt-pcr results than did illumina cloning data, indicating that sequencing depth would influence the quantitative measurement of mirna abundance, but the discrepancy caused by it was not significant, as seen from the high correlation between sbs and illumina cloning data.

bias of sequence variation, end secondary structure , and length distribution was observed for the different protocols of library construction. the solid data differ from the illumina data, due to distinct principles of adapter ligation in protocol. the adapter ligation principle based on  <dig> random nucleotides  hybridization seemed to provide a more dispersed distribution of length, higher frequency variation for nucleotides near the 3'- or 5'-ends, higher frequency of reads containing ess, and higher frequency of reads which do not map to known mirnas in sequencing data. the two nucleotides at the 3'-end of the majority of the reads of mir- <dig> in solid cloning data were truncated, which may be due to rna editing. we also found that the truncated sequence of mir- <dig> can form 3'-ess while the original sequence can not . the end secondary structures can hide the 5'- or 3'- end nucleotide, so that the direct adapter ligation may fail, but the pre-hybridization step preceding ligation may eliminate the ess, enabling subsequent successful ligation. that can explain the high-frequency of ess occurring in the solid cloning data. we also observed more than 10% 3'-ess for mir- <dig> sequences in illumina v <dig>  cloning data, but no ess for the illumina v <dig> protocol, indicating that the t <dig> rna ligase  <dig>  used in v <dig>  protocol may enable more adapters to ligate to mirnas with a double-stranded structure at the 3'-end  <cit> .

we finally assessed the relative abundance of  <dig> mirnas by qrt-pcr. the principle of reverse transcription -pcr with stem-loop primer is based on hybridization as for the solid protocol, which could explain the high correlation between qrt-pcr and solid cloning data. the fold difference data between hu sheep and dorper sheep using qrt-pcr and sbs sequencing correlated significantly, and the fold difference data for mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> using solid cloning were similar to data obtained with sbs sequencing and qrt-pcr, indicating that the methods using a hybridization principle may be more suitable for quantitative measurement of mirna abundance. moreover, qrt-pcr has been used prevalently for validation of microarray results  <cit>  and its accuracy has been recognized.
