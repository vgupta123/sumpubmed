BACKGROUND
escherichia coli is an important pathogen in cattle, medicine and public health  <cit> , and shiga toxin-producing strain  have emerged as important food-borne pathogens, especially serotype o157:h <dig>  human diseases caused by this serotype that produces stec ranges from mild diarrhoea to haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic uraemic syndrome  and typically it affects children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients  <cit> . healthy domestic ruminants such as cattle, sheep, and goats can harbor stec and e. coli o157:h <dig> in their faeces and are thus natural reservoirs of these pathogens . the pathogenicity of stec resides in a number of virulence factors, including shiga toxins , intimin, enterohaemolysin, and the stec autoagglutinating adhesin   <cit> . shiga toxin–producing  and enteropathogenic escherichia coli  represent two of the six different categories of diarrheagenic e. coli that can cause disease in humans  <cit> . stec, which is defined by the production of two shiga toxins, stx <dig> and/or stx <dig>  is a zoonotic pathogen that is a major cause of diarrhea worldwide. stx <dig> is more closely related to these diseases than stx <dig>  <cit> . there are three stx <dig> subtypes  and seven stx <dig> subtypes  according to the subtyping nomenclature proposal put forth at the 7th international symposium on shiga toxin –producing escherichia coli infection, held in buenos aires, in  <dig> 

the use of antimicrobial in animal feeds as growth promoters is common worldwide. across the globe, a variety of antimicrobial agents are available for therapeutic use or as growth promotion in animals. many studies have supported the claim that with the increased use of antimicrobial agents in animals and humans, an increased prevalence of resistant strains may be selected as a direct consequence of the antimicrobial use  <cit> . humans, via the food chain, ingest a lot of bacteria originating from food-producing animals, which have been recognized as major reservoirs of e. coli habouring ctx-m β-lactamase an enzyme that confers resistance to β-lactam antibiotics  <cit> . sasaki  <cit>  have reported a high prevalence of ctx-m β-lactamase encoding gene among enterobacteriaceae in stool specimens from healthy asymptomatic volunteers in a rural community in thailand. concerns exist about the potential spread of the β-lactam-ctx-m genes from food animal products to humans through the food chain. ctx-m β-lactamase genes have been reported in e. coli from various food-producing animals worldwide raising a potential threat to public health . giving the frequent occurrence of o <dig> stec as foodborne pathogen in north america and some parts of the western world, there is a clear need to gather data on the prevalence and distribution of stec producing e.coli and the antibiotic resistance profiles of isolates of this organism recovered from faecal samples from commercial dairy cattle farms in the eastern cape of south africa where pastoral farming is a major source of income for many families. this study therefore aimed at characterizing e.coli o <dig> isolates from fecal samples of two dairy cattle farms in the eastern cape province of south africa. ability of isolates to produce shiga toxin and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns as well as presence of some resistance determinants were screened by molecular approaches.

methods
ethical clearance
ethical clearance was obtained from the university of fort hare ethics committee prior to sample collection and permission was sought from farmers from whose farms samples were collected.

study population and sampling
details on the study population and sampling procedures are as follows. briefly, samples were collected from commercial dairy cattle farms in nkonkobe district of eastern cape province, south africa. a total of  <dig> samples from two commercial dairy farms were collected for the study. rectal fecal grab samples of approximately 10 g were collected from individual cattle using sterile gloves into appropriate capped containers. after collection, samples were shipped on ice to the university of fort hare microbiology laboratory for immediate processing.

preliminary sample processing
approximately 1 g of each fecal sample was mixed in 9 ml of trypticase soya broth  with 20 mg/l novobiocine and incubated for 6–8 h at 37 °c. this was streaked out onto sorbitol macconkey agar  supplemented with 1 mg/l potassium tellurite and incubated for 18–24 h at 37 °c. a pale colony each  was picked as presumptive e. coli o <dig> per sample. the pure colonies were each inoculated into separate tsb and incubated for 24 h at 37 °c from which glycerol stock was made and then stored at −80 °c for further analyses.

dna extraction
bacterial dna was prepared as previously described by bai  <cit> ; briefly, bacterial culture from glycerol stock was resuscitated by an overnight growth in trypticase soya broth   at 37 °c with slight agitation. from this culture, 2 ml was centrifuged for 5 min at  <dig>  rpm and the pellet was washed with normal saline . after the addition of 150 μl of rapid lysis buffer , the suspension was votexed, boiled for 15 min, centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm, supernatants collected in a dnase free eppendorf tube and stored at −20 °c. these were then used as templates in all the polymerase chain reactions  that were performed in this study.

molecular serotyping and virulence typing
molecular serotyping using the o-unit flippase gene  was performed: primers used for detection of o <dig> strains are shown in table  <dig>  e. coli o157:h <dig> atcc  <dig> served as the positive control. specific primers were used to detect the presence of virulence genes encoding the shiga-toxins  as previously described by  <cit> . amplification was performed using 25 μl of pcr mix containing 5 μl of bacterial dna purified as described above, 12 μl of 2x dream taq master mix , 10pmol of both forward and reverse primers and 6 μl of water of pcr grade. the conditions for pcr amplification performed in a thermal cycler  were 94 °c for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 93 °c for 60 s, either 55 °c for 60 s and 72 °c for 60 s. the final cycle was followed by an extension step at 72 °c for 7 min. the amplified products were visualized by standard gel electrophoresis using 5 μl of the pcr product on 2 % agarose gels in  <dig> x tbe buffer . gels were stained using ethidium-bromide  and photographed under uv light in a transilluminator .table  <dig> primers used in pcr detection of shiga toxin genes and determination of serotypes

pcr profiling of resistance genes
prevalence of amr genes
results of genetic profiling of the observed phenotypic resistances among the isolates showed predominance of blaampc 90 %, blacmy 70 %, blactx-m 65 %, and blatem 27 %, among the isolates that were resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cephalothin, cefuroxime, ceftazidime. pcr amplification of the blashv, blaveb, blactx-mgroup <dig> and blactx-mgroup <dig> did not yield any amplicon. the tet and stra resistance genes were amplified from 70 % and 80 % respectively of the isolates that were phenotypically resistant to tetracycline, oxytetracycline and streptomycin.

altogether, amr genes were detected in all e. coli isolates. the most frequent resistance genes were tet, str, bla-ampc,bla-cmy-i . with a very few exceptions, susceptibility test results were consistent with genotyping results. gel photographs of some of the amplified resistance genes are shown in figs.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  overall, amr genes were identified in 92 % of the o <dig> isolates recovered from studied samples. resistance genes detected from isolates as shown in table  <dig> table  <dig> pcr targeted genes and their percentage occurrence among the isolates

discussions
the prevalence of stec o <dig> serogroup in fecal samples collected from commercial dairy cattle was investigated. escherichia coli o157:h <dig>  is the shiga toxin-producing e. coli  serotype most frequently isolated and most often associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome  in the united states  <cit> . according to the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention, an estimated  <dig>  stec infections occur each year in the united states. stec o <dig> causes about 36 % of these infections and non-o <dig> stec cause the rest  <cit> . stec inhabits in the guts of ruminant animals, including cattle, goats, sheep, deer, and elk  <cit> . the major source for human illnesses is cattle and around 5–10 % of those who are diagnosed with stec infection develop a potentially life-threatening complication known as hemolytic uremic syndrome  with young children and the elderly more likely to develop severe illness and hemolytic uremic syndrome  than others.

in this study, a total of  <dig> fecal samples were collected from two commercial dairy farms in the eastern cape province of south africa. these samples were analyzed for the presence of o <dig> e.coli strain. a total of  <dig> isolates confirmed by pcr targeting the o-unit flippase gene  were delineated to be o <dig> isolates. results of the determination for the presence of shiga toxin encoding gene  among the  <dig> isolates showed that  <dig>  harbored the stx <dig> gene,  <dig>  were positive for stx <dig> while  <dig>  harbored both stx <dig> and stx <dig> genes. twenty five  of the isolates were commensals as no shiga toxin genes were detected in them.

according to gyles  <cit> , ruminants especially cattle and sheep are the major reservoir of stec and individual animal could carry more than one serogroups of stec. during processing, meat derived from infected animals may become contaminated by stec contained fecal materials if they are mistakenly mixed with it. barlow and mellor  <cit>  had reported the presence of stec in fecal samples of cattle from australia where a prevalence of 10 % was observed with e.coli o <dig> accounting for  <dig>  % of all the isolates. it is possible for fresh farm produce to be contaminated with stec where irrigation water or soil treated with farm effluent or manure is used in growing them. a prevalence as high as  <dig>  % of stec in bulk milk has been reported internationally  <cit> . it is also possible for stec to survive for a long time in soil applied with manure from cattle and sheep. the possibility of water sources being contaminated by stec is also very high as fecal materials of animal origin could be washed through storm drains into fresh waterbodies thus posing health challenges to the people who depend on such waterbodies for several uses. who  <cit>  had reported waterborne transmission of stec in both drinking and recreational water indicating the animal fecal matters are capable of transmitting stec producing e.coli.

there are increasing concerns about the use of antimicrobial products in food-producing animals and focus has been on human food safety because foods of animal origin are sometimes identified as the vehicles of food borne disease as well as resistant food borne pathogens carrying resistant genetic materials. we profiled the antimicrobial susceptibility of e.coli o <dig> isolates recovered from commercial dairy cattle that are constantly receiving  antimicrobial agents. we observed a very high level of multiple antimicrobial resistances among the isolates and the most common resistance was to tetracycline. this is not surprising since tetracycline is often used as a first-line antimicrobial in disease prevention and growth promotion in food animals and its widespread use has likely contributed to high rates of resistance  <cit> . the frequency of tetracycline resistance among the e. coli isolates from the farms that we investigated was  <dig>  %, which is within the range of values described in previous reports   <cit> . genetic profiling of the resistance determinants showed that the resistances were encoded by blaampc, blacmy, blactxm,blatem genes for the eslbs , while teta and stra genes were responsible for tetracycline and streptomycin respectively. high prevalence of ctx-m β-lactamase–encoding genes in enterobacteriaceae has been reported in stool specimens from healthy asymptomatic volunteers in a rural community in thailand  <cit> . the fact that bacteria which infect animals could also establish infections in humans poses concerns about the potential spread of the bla-ctx-m genes from food animal products to humans through the food chain. ctx-m β-lactamase has been increasingly reported in e. coli from various food-producing animals worldwide raising a potential threat to public health with the earliest account of ctx-m β-lactamase of food animal origin from spain, where a ctx-m-14–producing e. coli was isolated from healthy chickens  <cit> . since then, e.coli harboring ctx-m β-lactamase encoding gene has been reported from healthy cattle from japan  <cit>  and hong kong  <cit> , and from sick or healthy cattle from france  <cit>  and in the united states  <cit> . similarly, e.coli strains isolated from pigs that have the genetic repertoire to produce ctx-m-β-lactamase have also been reported from hong kong  <cit> , china  <cit> , spain  <cit> , and france  <cit> . in this study, genetic resistance determinants were however not amplified from some of the isolates and this could be attributed to the fact that the genetic elements targeted in our pcr profiling were not responsible for the observed phenotypic resistances as there are numerous arrays of genes that encodes for resistances to the drugs. besides, there are many resistance mechanisms like the efflux pump, intrinsic resistance, innate resistant or acquire resistance to one or few classes of antimicrobial agents. our findings also showed that most of the isolates were susceptible to imipenem, amikacin, kanamycin, the quinolones  and gentamicin. this finding is curious as regards the susceptibility to the quinolones because the farms that were sampled uses advocin  which is a synthetic fluoroquinolone in the treatment of respiratory disease in chickens, cattle and pigs and ought to have selected for other quinolone resistances as they have similar structure and mode of action.

to understand the bases of high tetracycline resistance among our isolates, we screened for tet determinants. the predominance of the tet efflux gene observed in our study is similar to that previously documented in coliforms  of human and animal origins by marshall  <cit> . in this study, we observed also a very high resistance to streptomycin among the isolates which is in partial agreement with the reported 53 % resistance of e.coli o <dig> isolates from feedlots by rao  <cit> . also, sawant  <cit>  reported a prevalence of 93 % of tetracycline resistance in e.coli of dairy cattle with tet accounting for the resistance determinant in 93 % of their isolates and this is similar to our finding though mediated by different variants of the gene.

the fact that bacteria from animals spread to the food products during slaughter and processing has been extensively documented . the detection of e.coli resistant to antibiotic growth promoters  in food products derived from animals where agps have been used therefore comes as no surprise. resistant bacteria and active antibiotics, or active metabolites of antibiotics can also spread on farmland with manure. in this study, we isolated toxigenic o <dig> e.coli strains carrying stx <dig> and stx <dig> genes that were also multi-resistant to many antibiotics some of which are medically important in human medicine. the possibility of these antibiotic resistant strains being shed into the environment and the eventual transmission of the resistance determinants to nonpathogenic environmental bacteria is high. such transfer of resistance determinants could fuel the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria  that could have grave implications on the health of humans and animals thus increasing the burden of disease in the community. there is therefore need for urgent policy formulations on the prudent use of antimicrobials in both human and veterinary medicine as failure in this regards could spell doom in the nearest future.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study demonstrated that antimicrobial resistant  determinants were present in dairy cattle exposed to veterinary antimicrobials for both therapeutic and as growth promoting agents. the overall resistance rate was high and the isolates have the genetic repertoires to survive antimicrobial pressure. though genetic capacity for shiga toxins production have been reported among e.coli nono <dig> serogroups, we did not profile for any other serogroups apart from o <dig> in the fecal samples analyzed. the observed phenotypic multiple resistances among the isolates were also genetically confirmed. there were high β-lactam resistances among the isolates and this poses health implications as these are the drugs of choice for the management of numerous gram negative infections. the results of this study suggest that agricultural activities, specifically antimicrobial use may have a significant impact on amr evolution in general. more studies with larger sample sizes and more precise amr genes typing by dna sequencing and molecular typing of bacterial strains are needed to further throw more light in this regard.
