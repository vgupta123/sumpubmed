BACKGROUND
maximal fio <dig> values  have been administered to horses to maintain or improve the arterial partial pressure of oxygen  and tissue oxygenation since the advent of inhalant anesthesia  <cit> . maximal fio <dig> concentrations are used in the belief that their use optimizes arterial o <dig> content  and o <dig> delivery  to tissues providing cardiac output  is maintained  <cit> . lower than expected  pao <dig> values are frequently encountered during equine inhalant anesthesia despite the use of maximal fio <dig>  <cit> . subnormal pao <dig> values usually develop during the first  <dig> to  <dig> min of anesthesia, continue for the duration of anesthesia, and resolve within  <dig> min of recovery to standing  <cit> . the  <dig> mechanisms producing subnormal pao <dig> values are decreased fio <dig>  diffusion impairment, vascular shunting , hypoventilation, and ventilation-perfusion mismatching   <cit> . decreased fio <dig>  diffusion impairment, and vascular shunts are unlikely to contribute to subnormal pao <dig> during inhalation anesthesia in normal horses. hypoventilation  is a common occurrence during equine anesthesia because virtually all anesthetic drugs cause respiratory depression. hypoventilation is easily corrected by mechanical ventilation  <cit> . the use of mechanical ventilators, mechanical ventilation and increased fio <dig> probably reduces the incidence of subnormal pao <dig> values however a significant number of horses continue to experience subnormal pao <dig> despite normocapnia and increased fio <dig>  <cit> .

the major cause of subnormal pao <dig> values in anesthetized horses is ventilation-perfusion mismatching within the lung parenchyma  <cit> . functional residual capacity and residual volume are reduced in recumbent horses during inhalant anesthesia  <cit> . the distribution of ventilation is shifted to non-dependent areas of lung and altered by changes in diaphragmatic function and mechanical ventilation  <cit> . the shifting of the distribution of lung ventilation uncouples ventilation and perfusion because lung perfusion remains primarily caudal-dorsal regardless of body posture  <cit> . ventilation-perfusion mismatching is exacerbated by atelectasis because collapsed alveoli continue to be perfused with little or no gas exchange. the two primary causes of atelectasis are compression  and absorption . compression atelectasis is more pronounced in dorsally recumbent horses compared to other species due to its long, sloping diaphragm  <cit> . the development of compression atelectasis can be partially offset or delayed by initiating mechanical ventilation early during the anesthetic period but predicted pao <dig> values are not always achieved  <cit> . ventilatory recruitment maneuvers including the use of positive end expiratory pressure  have been investigated in horses, however improvements are inconsistent and only occur when peep values that compromise q are employed  <cit> .

the relationship between pao <dig> and hemoglobin saturation varies with blood temperature, ph and intracellular factors  <cit> . although equine hemoglobin is more than 90% saturated at pao <dig> values greater than  <dig>  kpa , there is rapid desaturation at values below  <dig>  kpa   <cit> . one author has provided data from anesthetized horses demonstrating that do <dig> decreases when pao <dig> decreases, and that pao <dig> values less than  <dig>  kpa  are associated with decreases in venous partial pressure of oxygen , an indicator of the adequacy of do <dig>  <cit> .

the recognition that atelectasis contributes to ventilation-perfusion mismatching, intrapulmonary shunt and subnormal pao <dig> values has raised questions about the use of maximal fio <dig>  <cit> . absorption atelectasis is exacerbated by administering maximal fio <dig> because o <dig> is more readily absorbed than other, less soluble, gases such as nitrogen. further, studies in humans suggest that the use of maximal fio <dig> promotes alveolar damage, reduces cardiac index, and increases peripheral vascular resistance  <cit> . the use of  <dig>  fio <dig> could reduce absorption atelectasis and augment alveolar o <dig> tensions  thereby improving gas exchange and do <dig>  the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of  <dig>  fio <dig> and > <dig> % fio <dig> on pulmonary gas exchange, shunt fraction  and do <dig> in dorsally recumbent horses during inhalant anesthesia. our hypothesis was that  <dig>  fio <dig> would reduce ventilation-perfusion mismatching and increase the fraction of pulmonary blood flow that is oxygenated, thus improving cao <dig> and do <dig> 

RESULTS
all horses completed all phases of the experiment. initial flow rates for the  <dig>  fio <dig> group were  <dig> l/min of o <dig> and  <dig> l/min of air. flow rates required to maintain  <dig>  fio <dig> when the total flow rate was set at  <dig> ml/kg bwt/min ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> l/min for o <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> l/min for air. all horses were administered dobutamine during each trial . one horse developed atrial fibrillation  <dig> min after induction of anesthesia during the second procedure . atrial fibrillation continued throughout anesthesia and an electrocardiogram confirmed normal sinus rhythm  <dig> hr after the horse stood. blood pressures and heart rates in this horse were similar to other horses in this treatment group and ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bpm prior to the onset of atrial fibrillation and from  <dig> to  <dig> bpm after the onset of atrial fibrillation.

there were no changes or differences in right atrial pressure , mean pulmonary artery pressure , cardiac output , cardiac index , or systemic vascular resistance  over time or between groups . dobutamine-augmented arterial blood pressures were significantly decreased from preanesthetic values in both groups from  <dig> to  <dig> min after induction to anesthesia. arterial blood pressure was significantly higher than preanesthetic values  <dig> min after standing in the  <dig>  fio <dig> group but only mean arterial blood pressure  was significantly higher in the > <dig>  fio <dig> group at this interval. there were no differences between groups. respiratory rate was controlled at a rate of  <dig> -  <dig> breaths/min during anesthesia. respiratory rate was significantly decreased compared to preanesthetic levels  <dig> min after anesthesia in both groups.

discussion
the use of  <dig>  fio <dig> in dorsally-recumbent isoflurane-anesthetized horses did not reduce qs/qt or vd/vt compared to > <dig>  fio <dig>  arterial partial pressures of o <dig> and po <dig> were higher in horses breathing > <dig>  fio <dig> but do <dig> was not different between groups during  <dig> hr of anesthesia or after anesthesia. reduction of fio <dig> from >95% to 50% did not improve pulmonary gas exchange or oxygenation.

the results of this study support the hypothesis that the development of qs/qt mismatching from compression atelectasis is the most likely cause of impaired arterial oxygenation during inhalant anesthesia in the horse  <cit> . shunt fraction, po <dig>  and vd/vt increased in both groups after induction to anesthesia in our study. our results differ from two previous reports that found a greater qs/qt in horses that breathed > <dig>  fio <dig> compared to horses that breathed air during intravenous anesthesia  <cit>  and an increase in vd/vt when > <dig>  fio <dig> was compared to  <dig>  fio <dig> in spontaneously breathing, halothane-anesthetized horses  <cit> . in agreement with our results, the administration of varying helium-oxygen mixtures did not change qs/qt but resulted in progressive increases in po <dig> and pao <dig> as fio <dig> increased  <cit> . differences between our results and those of others may be due to the fio <dig> selected , the effects of intravenous and different inhalant anesthetics , the duration of anesthesia, the mode of ventilation , or body position . positive pressure ventilation and inhalant anesthetics alter the distribution of ventilation in the anesthetized horse but most have accepted this limitation of the two techniques in the interest of normalization of paco <dig> and the maintenance of consistent anesthetic depth  <cit> . body position is a primary determinant of oxygenation in anesthetized horses with dorsal recumbency consistently associated with larger decrements in pulmonary function and gas exchange  <cit> . the cause for the decrements in pulmonary function has classically been attributed to a gravity-dependent shift in blood flow and a shift in ventilation to less dependent lung zones  <cit> . this description has been challenged by several studies that have demonstrated that only small shifts in blood flow occur in anesthetized horses after changes of body position  <cit> . we purposefully selected overweight horses and placed them in dorsal recumbency for an extended period in order to maximize the potential for changes in fio <dig> to improve gas exchange and reduce hypoxemia  <cit> .

similar to others we confirmed that > <dig>  fio <dig> is associated with greater pao <dig> and po <dig> values than the those produced by  <dig>  to  <dig>  fio <dig> and that cao <dig> and do <dig> may not be markedly different if arterial hemoglobin remains fully saturated  <cit> . step-wise increases in fio <dig> to titrate pao <dig> and cao <dig> have been proposed  <cit>  but such an approach requires multiple gas sources, the ability to determine fio <dig> and frequent sampling of arterial blood for arterial blood gas analysis. the differences in pao <dig> and po <dig> between the two groups in the face of no difference in calculated qs/qt is a function of the sigmoid shape of the oxyhemoglobin saturation curve and highlights the importance of considering both pao <dig> and cao <dig> when assessing the significance of changes in the ranges of pao <dig> and qs/qt routinely encountered in the anesthetized horse  <cit> .

the incidence of subnormal pao <dig> values and hypoxemia in dorsally recumbent anesthetized horses is a recurring problem during equine anesthesia and has been associated with body shape, body weight, low pulse pressures, emergency case status, and male gender  <cit> . it has been suggested that the application of controlled ventilation immediately after induction to anesthesia is more likely to maintain pao <dig> during anesthesia but controlled ventilation may decrease q and thus do <dig>  <cit> . additional proposed methods of improving oxygenation in anesthetized horses include peep, inhalation of aerosolized bronchodilators such as albuterol, selective mechanical ventilation of dependent lung regions and breathing helium-oxygen mixtures  <cit> . positive end expiratory pressures of at least  <dig> cm of water may improve cao <dig> without changing qs/qt but q is reduced unless fluids and cardiac inotropes  are administered  <cit> . aerosolized albuterol is reported to increase pao <dig> but its effects are inconsistent in the authors' and other's experience regarding efficacy and consistency of effect  <cit> . selective mechanical ventilation combined with selective peep consistently increases do <dig>  however it requires a surgical procedure  and multiple ventilators  <cit> .

the lowest individual pao <dig> measurements in our study ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kpa  in the  <dig>  fio <dig> group and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kpa  in the > <dig>  fio <dig> group. all horses in  <dig>  fio <dig> group had pao <dig> values below  <dig>  kpa  at some time during the anesthetic period and  <dig> of  <dig> horses had pao <dig> values below  <dig>  kpa . only one of  <dig> horses in the > <dig>  fio <dig> group had a pao <dig> below  <dig>  kpa . all horses in both trials had pao <dig> values below  <dig>  kpa  ten minutes after discontinuation of anesthesia but cao <dig> did not change from preanesthetic levels and was not different between groups at any time suggesting there was no apparent advantage with either technique. further, recent studies in laterally recumbent isoflurane anesthetized horses have determined that breathing > <dig>  fio <dig> for  <dig> min does not affect erythrocyte membrane dynamics or structure, blood viscosity or muscular perfusion and that breathing room air  decreases skeletal muscle oxygenation  <cit> .

the results of our study, although limited by a relatively small sample size, are similar and consistent with those of others  <cit> . one of our horses developed atrial fibrillation, which could have influenced the development of v/q and our results. the range of hr and q for the horse that developed atrial fibrillation was similar in both trials so we do not believe that it affected our results since the development of atrial fibrillation in the absence of cardiac disease, is not necessarily associated with the deterioration of hemodynamics  <cit> . we did not have the capability of performing the multiple inert gas elimination technique which would have allowed potential differentiation between pulmonary units with low and high v/q and shunt  <cit> . regardless, the ability to more precisely identify v/q matching and shunt would not have changes our results. decreases in atelectasis, qs/qt, and po <dig> are interesting but unless they result in improvements in pao <dig>  cao <dig>  and do <dig>  their impact is suspect. the risks of inhaling > <dig>  fio <dig> are well documented in other species  <cit>  but we could find no reports of pathology associated with the use of > <dig>  fio <dig> in horses anesthetized for clinically relevant durations. to the contrary, isoflurane anesthetized horses breathing > <dig> % o <dig> for  <dig> min demonstrated minimal damage from reactive oxygen species and no alterations in muscular perfusion  <cit> . the use of submaximal fio <dig> requires additional equipment and more stringent monitoring thus increasing expense. in the absence of evidence of benefit, the authors do not recommend the use of submaximal  <dig>  fio <dig> in anesthetized horses.

CONCLUSIONS
the purpose of breathing increased fio <dig> during equine anesthesia is to partially offset the loss of the adaptive mechanisms that are initiated by hypoxemia in awake horses such as increases in ventilation, q and contraction of the spleen  <cit> . these mechanisms are obtunded or eliminated during inhalant anesthesia in horses. our study suggests that decreasing fio <dig> to  <dig> % from maximal levels does not improve pulmonary gas exchange or do <dig> during inhalant anesthesia in horses. further studies investigating the benefits of alternative gas mixtures  and modes of ventilation in conjunction with changes in fio <dig> are warranted.
