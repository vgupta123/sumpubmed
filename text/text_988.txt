BACKGROUND
biology has seen the proposition of several species concepts. of these, the biological species concept  <cit>  is historically the most influential; according to it all individuals belong to the same species if they produce viable and fertile offspring in nature, i.e., they share a common gene pool. to account for inherent difficulties to test this concept in practice, especially in allopatric populations that never encounter each other, biologists tend to supplement it by elements of the morphospecies concept . with the advance of molecular genetic data over the past decades many researchers now define species by genetic characteristics rather than morphological ones because genetics provides a means of actually measuring recent or ongoing genetic connectivity between species  <cit> . species boundaries are strengthened by accumulation of genomic incompatibilities preventing formation of zygotes, so called dobzhansky-muller incompatibilities  <cit> . once evolved, post-zygotic isolation is irreversible, in contrast to pre-zygotic barriers such as mate recognition. there is much evidence that post-zygotic barriers evolve slowly in birds  <cit> , potentially contributing to the high rates of hybridisation observed in this group  <cit>  and explaining why genetic distances can be low in spite of large morphological differences  <cit> .

when populations diverge into species their gene pools become disconnected, and even in the absence of ecological differentiation stochastic effects, i.e., genetic drift, will drive each new species towards increased differentiation. if introgression of genetic material of one species into another occurs regularly enough in the absence of genomic incompatibility, one would expect that these events oppose genetic drift by exchange of alleles that the two subsequently will have in common. such potential sharing of alleles at genetic loci through genetic admixture can directly be observed by the study of genetic markers. one type of genetic marker that has recently received a lot of attention is the 'single nucleotide polymorphism'   <cit> . due to the abundance of snps in genomes and suitability for high automation in genotyping, snps can be characterised in large numbers, yielding a representative image of an entire genome. with snp data from multiple species, one can study the sharing of genetic material at the same loci, providing a new means of studying species divergence by the speed of loss of genetic coherence.

while persistent genetic admixture can lead to the merging of species  <cit>  this does not generally seem to be the case in some taxonomic groups. for example, ducks  show much hybridisation in the wild, with viable and fertile offspring  <cit> . in spite of this, duck species remain morphologically distinct. males especially display species-specific plumage, ornamentation, and courtship behaviour . in the present study, we utilise a recently developed snp set for the mallard   <cit>  to infer the degree of genomic connectivity among five species of closely related, ecologically similar and morphologically well differentiated duck species, among which interspecific hybridisation is commonplace. with this example we set out to illustrate how analysis of "snp persistence time" facilitates the understanding of the evolutionary impact of ongoing hybridisation, how it can reveal the existence of superspecies complexes, and how it sheds light on longstanding unresolved puzzles of speciation processes.

RESULTS
genotypic differentiation between anas platyrhynchos and other duck species
we screened  <dig> snps developed for the mallard, anas platyrhynchos,  <cit>  in the genomes of six duck species, five of genus anas and one of aythya, the latter mainly for outgroup comparison: anas platyrhynchos , anas acuta , anas crecca, , anas penelope , anas strepera  and aythya fuligula . the snps were evaluated for minor allele frequency  spectrum, hardy-weinberg equilibrium and linkage disequilibrium in anas platyrhynchos from nine localities on three continents. the great majority of snps does not significantly deviate from neutrality and are unlinked.

we plotted the results of a series of principal component analyses  for several combinations of individual of anas platyrhynchos and other species genotypes. all plots are based on the first and second pca axes. other axes were investigated visually but did not provide further insight. no clear genetic clusters among specimens of anas platyrhynchos were discernible in this analysis when analysed separately, and the evident absence of genetic structure in mallards is reflected by low values of explained variance in the first and second pcas . geography had no influence on genetic similarity. even after correcting for potential mislabelling or outliers  a few individuals seem to lie a bit outside the main cluster, but note that the scaling of differences between anas platyrhynchos individuals in this pca is different from the scaling in analyses involving other duck species . interestingly, a lack of population structure in mallards has also been described on a continent-scale for mitochondrial data  <cit>  and on a global scale using snps . the other species form distinct clusters if analysed together : anas penelope and anas strepera form one cluster and are hard to distinguish from each other. anas acuta and anas crecca each form their own specific clusters. aythya fuligula is of a different genus and hence not a dabbling duck. it serves as outgroup here and clearly lies outside these clusters. when individuals of all species are analysed jointly in this way , anas platyrhynchos is clearly distinct from the other species. a putative hybrid between anas acuta and anas platyrhynchos is placed exactly in between its assumed parental species, thereby confirming its supposed hybrid status.

snp sharing among duck species is unexpectedly high
genotyping was successful in the non-anas platyrhynchos species with only 14-24% missing genotypes while within anas platyrhynchos  this number was 4%. of  <dig> anas platyrhynchos snps,  <dig>  were polymorphic in anas acuta,  <dig>  in anas crecca,  <dig>  in anas penelope,  <dig>  in anas strepera, and  <dig>  in aythya fuligula . the proportion of shared snps between the anas species are high compared with those reported in studies comparing other species with similar evolutionary distances. bovines , for instance, have a relatively recent, pleistocene radiation  <dig>  million years ago , yet snp sharing does not exceed 5%  <cit> . snp sharing in the genus gallus , another taxon with putative pleistocene speciation and recent introgression from domestic animals, is also estimated at 5% <cit> , while in sheep  it is estimated at only 1%  <cit> . the same low levels of snp sharing also occur in invertebrate and plant species. the flies drosophila pseudoobscura and d. miranda show  <dig> % snp sharing  <cit>   while the plant pairs arabidopsis halleri/a. lyrata petraea and a. lyrata lyrata/a. l. petraea share  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively  <cit>  . given the divergence time of anas platyrhynchos from, e.g., anas acuta and anas crecca of at least  <dig>  mya  <cit>   they share up to an order of magnitude more snps than shown in these previous reports.

generally, the rate of snp sharing in closely related species, as reported thus far, appears to be in the order of a few percent, at maximum. random genetic drift usually purges polymorphisms as a function of time , effective population size  and initial maf, allowing an approximation of the time to fixation of allele frequencies under genetically neutral conditions  <cit> . for anas platyrhynchos we estimate the mean persistence time  for alleles with the highest possible maf to be  <dig>  million years, assuming a generation time of one year and ne being constant at the present-day number. in the other duck species studied here it ranges between  <dig>  and  <dig> million years. rare alleles, e.g. maf <  <dig> , are lost more quickly . the probability distribution for this loss has a long tail towards longer persistence times, with 5% of the shared polymorphisms with a maf =  <dig>  expected to be retained after a calculated threshold of  <dig> ne generations  <cit> . for anas platyrhynchos this would equate to  <dig>  million years . thus, anas platyrhynchos could have retained some of the ancestral shared polymorphisms since that split. however, anas acuta and anas crecca currently have much smaller ne, and are unlikely to have retained more than 5% of their ancestral polymorphisms for periods longer than  <dig> and  <dig>  million years , if these species were reproductively fully isolated. even with three times higher ne or generation time, the number of shared snps between the studied duck species is higher than expected: the persistence times of the 5% fraction of snps with maf =  <dig>  for anas acuta and anas crecca  just exceed their divergence time from anas platyrhynchos . on the other hand, under these scenarios anas penelope and anas strepera would not have retained more than 5% of snps with maf =  <dig>  after  <dig>  and  <dig>  million years, respectively, at a minimum divergence time from anas platyrhynchos of  <dig> mya  <cit> . in conclusion, it seems the number of shared snps between the studied duck species exceeds what is likely under the neutral theory even when conservatively high estimates of ne  and conservatively low divergence times  are assumed.

increased population size by ongoing interspecific hybridisation
what can then explain the high level of shared polymorphisms? we argue that these  duck species are part of a superspecies complex, here defined as a group of distinct species that frequently hybridise, with fertile offspring as the result. the superspecies concept was put forward by mayr in  <dig>  <cit> , as a translation of the german expression artenkreis, based on the work of rensch  <cit> . initially, it was used to assign species status to allopatric "races" that were too distinct to be lumped into the same species  <cit>  . later, the definition was widened by kiriakoff  <cit>  and mayr and short  <cit>  to be no longer exclusive to allopatric populations. for the anas platyrhynchos complex this concept has previously been used by scherer  <cit> . being aware that "superspecies" is not an official taxonomic category we here choose to use the term superspecies  to embrace the sympatric distribution of interbreeding duck species. in doing so, we do not attempt to redefine nomenclatural classification schemes, nor do we propose to change current nomenclature. the term superspecies is clearly "an evolutionary taxonomy category but not nomenclatural rank"  <cit> , thus to be preferred when studying biological systems rather than nomenclature.

there is longstanding anecdotal, morphological and experimental evidence for high hybridisation rates in ducks  <cit> , but molecular proof has been limited thus far. two studies using mitochondrial dna in the anas rubripes/platyrhynchos  <cit>  and anas zonorhyncha/platyrhynchos  <cit>  complexes confirm hybridisation between these species. these findings were corroborated by studies investigating one to two nuclear markers  <cit> . our study, using shared polymorphisms at hundreds of independent loci across the entire genome provides a more powerful means of analysing gene pool connectivity between closely related species and our results are consistent with a high level of genetic transfer between species via hybrid production and backcrossing.

a structure  <cit>  analysis identified several cases where genetic admixture from other species seems supported by their genotypes. when all six duck species were analysed jointly with the genetic clustering software structure, all non-anas platyrhynchos individuals were assigned to the same cluster . anas acuta individuals in particular showed partial anas platyrhynchos genome admixture, and many anas platyrhynchos individuals displayed some admixture from other species. when anas platyrhynchos individuals were excluded, structure assigned anas penelope, anas strepera and aythya fuligula individuals to their species specific clusters, although one anas strepera individual  was almost fully assigned to anas penelope. anas acuta and anas crecca were lumped into one cluster, and the hybrid was correctly assigned to that cluster by only 50% of its genome . excluding the hybrid from analysis did not alter the assignment of these two species to the same cluster. the same data sets were analysed with comparable settings in the software instruct  <cit> , which does not assume hardy-weinberg equilibrium in the inferred populations, and yields qualitatively similar results as the structure analysis. this may be direct evidence of partial gene pool sharing between species, hence the establishment of a superspecies complex.

for example, a superspecies complex comprising anas platyrhynchos, anas acuta and anas crecca would have a joint census population size of  <dig> million individuals and hence an ne of  <dig>  million , although sub-division of this possible superspecies due to assortative mating makes this an over-estimate <cit> . however, an ne of  <dig>  million results in a mean persistence time of almost  <dig> million years . with an estimated most recent common ancestor at  <dig>  mya, these species could have on average retained even snps of lower maf =  <dig> . we refer to this analysis as 'persistence time analysis'.

species status and the supra-population concept
the ducks studied here have not only remained morphologically distinct, their genetic cluster species designation  <cit>  is strongly supported by principal component analysis of snp genotypes: we find clear genetic differentiation between anas platyrhynchos and the other duck species, as well as among these . even though all these species live in sympatry, such a combined population is highly structured by assortative mating. while geographical substructure would be indicated by the term "meta-population", the situation in ducks leads us to define a new term that does not have a geographical connotation: "supra-population". we define a supra-population as a group of individuals that are part of the same sympatric superspecies complex and within which natural hybridisation occurs. individuals of a superspecies complex are genetically-connected hybridising species, in which species barriers are primarily maintained by pre-zygotic factors.

a new model of speciation in ducks
genomic incompatibilities usually lead to irreversible post-zygotic isolation of populations, but other, reversible, barriers can also be strong drivers of speciation. visual cues have been identified as drivers of speciation in sexually dimorphic bird species  <cit>  while sexual imprinting alone can explain assortative mating in modeling studies  <cit> . an empirical example from another anatid species, the snow goose anser caerulescens, which has two wide ranging colour morphs, nicely illustrates the case  <cit> . at any rate, a model for speciation in ducks must be able to explain the observed pattern of genetic and morphological differentiation in spite of the high degree horizontal gene exchange.

paleogeographic and paleoclimatic evidence suggest that ecological conditions have been favourable for a duck radiation 6- <dig> mya. this late miocene period was warm and humid  <cit> , but in transition towards a colder climate. precipitation remained relatively high  <cit> , making wetlands abundant and turning large inland salt water bodies brackish or even freshwater . globally, during this transition towards a colder, wet climate tropical forests were largely replaced by open grasslands  <cit> , a habitat well suited for ducks. the fossil record of ducks beyond the pleistocene is still very poor  <cit>  but the few studies on the subject suggest that morphological change in respective duck species has been very limited over the last few million years  <cit> , after a larger waterfowl species turn-over 15- <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the first fossil that resembles anas platyrhynchos is thought to be from the late pliocene, about  <dig> mya  <cit> . this is close to the suggested lower bound of divergence times of some anas species in the latest phylogeny of anatidae  <cit> . we propose that an anas-like duck split into multiple sister morphs sympatrically and simultaneously at that time, subsequently diverging by assortative mating. our results indicate that the resulting cluster of species still exchanges portions of their genomes. we argue that since branching off of the anas clade at least  <dig> mya these mostly sympatric species remain separate by isolating mechanisms other than genetic incompatibilities, mostly by assortative mating. though we acknowledge that this speciation scenario rests on the assumption of widespread sympatry for millions of years, we feel comfortable in making this claim. although we only sampled five species for the present study, our model system sensu lato is the specious genus anas, and even though species distributions change over time there certainly have always been several anas species living in sympatry.

theoretical studies suggest that sexual imprinting can drive speciation even in sympatry  <cit> . moreover, experimental manipulations clearly demonstrate that individuals of anas platyrhynchos can be imprinted on nearly any species of waterfowl but when raised in isolation they recognise conspecifics as mates  <cit> . this suggests that imprinting is important but incomplete in ducks; genetic factors also contribute to mate recognition. the presence of assortative mating and recognition mechanisms are prerequisites for sympatric speciation leading to a superspecies complex around anas platyrhynchos.

CONCLUSIONS
the amount of shared polymorphism between the studied duck species cannot be explained by large population sizes of the respective species only. we suggest extraordinary and evolutionarily sustained hybridisation rates as drivers of ongoing gene pool mixing. gene flow continues and will allow the transfer of genetic material among duck species. at present, extensive hybridisation still occurs. the genetic compatibility of different duck species, combined with mixed effects of genetically determined and imprinted mate choice leads to speciation reversals  <cit>  despite genotypically and morphologically defined species boundaries. present-day occurrence of anas platyrhynchos in large numbers and wide geographical extent may even drive some of their close relatives to extinction by hybridisation  <cit> . this is a major concern in many parts of the world, especially where anas platyrhynchos is not indigenous  <cit> . many species of the genus anas are hard to fit into the biological species concept because their evolution has rather led to a superspecies complex with discernable lineages. besides the five dabbling duck species studied here, it is likely that many more of the ca.  <dig> anas species are part of the global supra-population.

besides conservation implications, this creates large evolutionary potential, comparable to bacteria, which are able to exchange genes among different species by horizontal gene transfer. further, increasing effective population sizes into the millions may allow non-adaptive evolutionary processes to act, opening up additional degrees of evolutionary freedom  <cit> . snp-based analysis at hundreds of independent loci across the entire genome, as done here, may serve to re-evaluate long-standing puzzling patterns of speciation and hybridisation in several bird groups, such as other waterfowl, galliforms, hummingbirds and woodpeckers  <cit> , as well as in many other organisms where species pairs exhibit unusually high levels of hybridisation.
