BACKGROUND
the development of dna microchip technology has allowed the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism  on a genome-wide scale to identify genetic variants associated with diseases. researchers have proposed many methods to investigate association patterns of complex diseases. two recent reviews  <cit>  presented detailed analyses on many popular methods and tools, such as multifactor dimensionality reduction   <cit> , random jungle  <cit> , bayesian epistasis association mapping   <cit>  and plink  <cit> . mdr is a popular non-parametric approach for detecting all possible k-way combinations of snps that interact to influence disease traits. random jungle , is to solve classification and regression problems. in random forest, decision trees are combined to produce accurate predication. its ability to handle the high dimensional problems in gwas has been shown in  <cit> . beam designs a bayesian marker partition model which classifies snp markers into three types: snps unassociated with the disease, snps contributing to the disease susceptibility independently, and snps influencing the disease risk jointly with each other. in this model, a first order markov chain is designed for the accommodation of correlation between adjacent snps. markov chain monte carlo  sampling is used to optimize the posterior probability of the model. in addition, the "b-statistic" designed in beam can be used in the frequentist hypothesis-testing framework. plink provides a toolkit for flexible analyses, in which various statistical tests for single-locus analysis, haplotype analysis and allelic-based interaction analysis are implemented. recently, a new method named "boost"  <cit>  allows examination of all pairwise interactions in genome-wide case-control studies. as a result, many genetic susceptibility determinants have been mapped.

however, there is another type of association pattern, which often occurs within local regions in the genome and may not be detected by these methods. this association pattern involves multiple correlated snps with neither strong marginal effects nor strong interaction effects. but they can jointly display strong associations. here we use some simple regression models to explain this association pattern. suppose we have two dependent variables, x <dig> and x <dig>  and one independent variable y. we can fit two regression models ,  and , to test the association significance of these two variables. here  and  are named as marginal coefficients. if these two marginal coefficients are very small, single variable analysis methods will consider them statistically insignificant and ignore them.

however, if x <dig> correlates with x <dig>  fitting the model y ~ β1x <dig> + β2x <dig> may identify a new association pattern with β <dig> and β <dig>  being significantly larger than  and . this phenomenon is referred to as unfaithfulness. it means that the marginal effects of correlated variables do not express their significant joint effects faithfully due to the correlation cancelation  <cit> . figure  <dig> provides some synthetic examples to show the unfaithfulness involving two variables. there are four scenarios to illustrate the relationship between marginal coefficients  and bivariate regression coefficients. the first scenario ) is a reference case that involves no correlations between x <dig> and x <dig>  the marginal coefficients  and  are equal to the bivariate regression coefficients β <dig> and β <dig>  respectively. in the second scenario ), x <dig> is positively correlated with x <dig>  the marginal coefficients are bigger than the bivariate regression coefficients. in the third scenario ), x <dig> is negatively correlated with x <dig>  the marginal coefficient  and  could be significantly smaller than the bivariate regression coefficients β <dig> and. β <dig> in the the fourth scenario ), x <dig> is positively correlated with x <dig>  but the sign of β <dig> is the opposite of the sign of β <dig>  the correlation effect in the third scenario and the fourth scenario causes the unfaithfulness. in mathematics, the relationship between the marginal coefficients and the bivariate regression coefficients is formulated as   

where  is the expectation of the marginal coefficient , ρ is the population correlation between x <dig> and x <dig>  the marginal coefficients depend on their bivariate regression coefficients as well as the variable correlation, as we illustrated in figure  <dig>  we will give more explanation on this relationship in the high dimensional setting in the discussion section.

from the statistical point of view, different correlation patterns could cause the marginal coefficients  and  significantly different from the bivariate regression coeffcients β <dig> and β <dig> . in fact, the issue of unfaithfulness has been discussed in the causality literature  <cit> . in gwas, the correlation among snps arises due to the linkage disequilibrium pattern of the genome. a natural question arises: does the issue of unfaithfulness occur in gwas?

to answer this question, a computational method for detecting associations masked by unfaithfulness is necessary. in this paper, we propose a simple method to detect such associations involving two snps. it can evaluate each snp pair in genome-wide case-control studies in a fast manner. we have applied our method to analyze seven data sets from the wellcome trust case control consortium . the experimental results show that these associations widely exist in gwas. in this work, we only handle the unfaithfulness issue involving two snps while the unfaithfulness can exist among a large number of markers. the detection of associations involving three or more snps is too time-consuming and beyond the scope of this work.

RESULTS
experiment on simulation study
the simulation study is designed to compare our proposed method with other three methods for detecting associations in the presence of unfaithfulness. these three methods include the marginal association test , lasso  <cit>  and beam  <cit> . the reasons that we choose these methods for comparison are as follows:

• marginal association test is used in almost every gwas due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

• lasso is a shrinkage and selection method for  linear regression. it imposes a sparsity constraint  and uses l <dig> penalty to eliminate irrelevant variables. fast algorithms are available for lasso. thus, it can simultaneously analyze a huge number of variables. it is very popular in genetics  <cit> .

• beam has the capability of detecting both marginal associations and interactions in large-scale data sets. it uses first order markov chain to accommodate the correlation between adjacent snps.

the details about the parameter settings in simulation are provided in the method section. in our simulation study, we only handle the unfaithfulness involving two associated variables x <dig> and x <dig> by using β <dig> >  <dig>  β <dig> <  <dig> and ρ >  <dig> as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the marginal coefficients  and  will be small due to the cancelation given by equation . when β <dig> >  <dig>  β <dig> >  <dig> and ρ <  <dig> the unfaithfulness also happens. this corresponds to a situation that the minor alleles of both x <dig> and x <dig> increase the diseases risk but x <dig> and x <dig> are negatively correlated, as illustrated in figure  <dig> 

the results in figure  <dig> indicate that it is difficult for existing methods to detect the association masked by unfaithfulness while our proposed method achieves reasonable performance. specifically, the poor performance of the marginal association test is not surprising since the marginal effects are weak in the presence of unfaithfulness. although lasso can simultaneously analyze all snps, it still suffers from the difficulty of detecting associations masked by unfaithfulness. this agrees with the analysis result in  <cit> . beam has a better performance, which should be attributed to its first order markov chain designed for the accommodation of correlation. but its performance is still not comparable with the performance of our proposed method in most settings.

another interesting point is that the statistical power of existing methods decreases as the linkage disequilibrium  r <dig> increases. although our proposed method also degrades its performance when ld increases, it maintains a relatively high power for strong ld .

experiment on seven data sets from wtccc
we have applied our method to analyze the data sets  from the wtccc  <cit> . wtccc studies seven common human diseases, including bipolar disorder , coronary artery disease , crohn's disease , hypertension , rheumatoid arthritis , type  <dig> diabetes  and type  <dig> diabetes . these data sets are generated using the affymetrix  <dig> k chip. we first apply a similar quality control procedure as suggested in  <cit>  to pre-process the data. the numbers of remaining snps for seven data sets are around  <dig> . in current stage, beam cannot directly handle these data sets  <cit> .

t <dig> - the threshold of bonferroni-corrected p-value is  <dig> ; t <dig> - the threshold of bonferroni-corrected p-value is  <dig> ; t <dig> - the threshold of bonferroni-corrected p-value is  <dig> ; dist - the physical distance threshold between two snps is at least  <dig> mb. this threshold is used to see how many unfaithfulness associations involving two remote loci

from the identified associations, we further conduct the gene mapping and identify some suspicious genes closely related with the disease traits. table  <dig> and table  <dig> report the unadjusted single-locus p-values, the unadjusted joint p-values, the marginal coefficients and joint bivariate coefficients for these associations. the other details are listed in the supplementary document . these identified associations coincide with figure  <dig>  to date, we can only connect some identified associations to publicly available results from other association studies. many identified association patterns still remain unexplained. in the following, we explain the details of some associations that are confirmed by other studies.

here we assume additive effects in regression.

bipolar disorder 
among associated snp pairs identified from the bd data set, we find two suspicious snp pairs,  and . the unadjusted p-values for these two snp pairs are  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  respectively. they are still significant after bonferroni correction. however, none of these three snps  was reported in  <cit>  because their marginal effects are too weak to be detected by the single-locus association test. the unadjusted p-values for these three snps based on the single-locus association test are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. all three snps reside in the intron of gene mcoln <dig>  the protein mucolipin- <dig>  encoded by gene mcoln <dig> and also known as trpml <dig> , has been confirmed to have strong associations with bipolar disorder in a family-based association study  <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the first identified association between the mcoln <dig> gene and the bipolar disorder risk in a population-based association study.

we further use beagle  <cit>  to impute the snps in this local area so that we can see the enriched signals after imputation. this region includes  <dig> snps. it begins with the snp rs <dig> and ends with the snp rs <dig>  after imputation, we analyze the imputed data and the result is given in figure  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the enriched signal. the intensity shows -log10p values given by the joint regression . figure  <dig> shows the ld structure of this local area. figure  <dig> shows the -log10p values obtained using single-snp analysis . figure  <dig> shows the locations of rs <dig>  rs <dig> and rs <dig>  from figure  <dig>  we can see the following:

• although this region is in strong ld ), association masked by unfaithfulness does not happen across the entire area. this shows that this type of asssociation not only depends on the correlation structure but also depends on the effects of the snps, as we illustrated in figure  <dig> .

• from figure  <dig>  the marginal effects of the imputed snps are very weak. this indicate that this type of association is not caused by some ungenotyped causative snps. instead, it is a genuine effect.

coronary artery disease 
we identify four suspicious associations involving five snps. the unadjusted p-values for these four associations range from  <dig>  × 10- <dig> to  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  the unadjusted single-locus p-values for five snps involved in these five associations indicate that they do not have noticeable marginal effects. all five snps reside in the intron of gene fsip <dig> . we have not found evidence to directly connect gene fsip <dig> with the coronary artery disease. however, the ld analysis identifies a well studied gene thbs <dig> , which is centromeric to gene fsip <dig> and has been confirmed to increase the risk of coronary artery disease in many studies  <cit> . it would be of great interest to investigate gene fsip <dig> in determining genetic susceptibility to coronary artery disease.

here we also show the enriched signals obtained from the imputation. figure  <dig> shows the -log10p given by the joint regression. figure  <dig> shows the ld structure  in that region. figure  <dig> shows the -log10p of single snp analysis. figure  <dig> shows the locations of the genotyped snps which are listed in table  <dig>  again, the marginal effects of the imputed snps are weak. we see clearly that the signal of unfaithfulness appears in the block-like manner.

type  <dig> diabetes 
most identified associations from the t1d data set are linked with the mhc region. the mhc region at chromosomal position 6p <dig> encodes many genes  that have been associated with type  <dig> diabetes  <cit>  by using the single-locus test. however, it is still unclear which and how many loci within the mhc region determine t1d susceptibility because of the functional complexity of this small human genome segment. the mhc region has been connected with more than  <dig> diseases, such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, asthma and various autoimmune disorders. our results provide additional information to locate disease-associated loci. concretely, one suspicious association involves snp rs <dig> and snp rs <dig>  the unadjusted p-value of this association is  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  the unadjusted single-locus p-values of rs <dig> and rs <dig> are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. snp rs <dig> resides in the intron region of gene gnl <dig> and snp rs <dig> resides in the intron region of gene ppp1r <dig>  both genes are located in the mhc region and adjacent to each other. gene gnl <dig> belongs to the hla-e class. the locus in hla-e has been strongly associated with type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . the detailed examination of the relationship between gene gnl <dig> and gene ppp1r <dig> may provide some new insights in studying the causes of type  <dig> diabetes.

hypertension 
among associations identified from the ht data set, we find one suspicious pair involving snp rs <dig> and snp rs <dig>  the unadjusted p-value is  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  the unadjusted single-locus p-values for rs <dig> and rs <dig> are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. both snps reside in the intron of gene rcan <dig>  gene rcan <dig> mainly functions as a regulator of calcineurin. calcineurin participates in many cellular and tissue functions. its abnormal expression is associated with many diseases including hypertension  <cit> .

crohn's disease , rheumatoid arthritis  and type  <dig> diabetes 
currently, we have difficulties to connect the identified associations of cd, ra and t2d to publicly available findings from other association studies. their biological implications need to be further explored.

experiment on the illumina data sets from other independent studies
we further analyze the crohn's disease data set  <cit> , in which  <dig>  autosomal snps were assayed on the illumina humanhap <dig> chip. after a standard quality control , the number of remaining snps is  <dig> .

we apply our method to this data set and do not find any significant associations masked by unfaithfulness. our explanation is that illumina chip uses the tagsnp design and the correlation among snps is less than that of affymetrix  <dig> k chip used by wtccc. this result indicates that it is unlikely to detect associations masked by unfaithfulness using the tagsnp design.

in order to check if imputation helps in identifying significant association masked by unfaithfulness, we focus on the snp regions in which we have identified associations from the wtccc cd data set , impute the corresponding snp data from  <cit> , and re-run our analysis. unfortunately, we fail to replicate those findings in the wtccc cd data set. we have examined the imputation result carefully. at those local regions we are interested in, few snps are directly genotyped. in the hapmap data, hundreds of snps locate in those areas. this implies hundreds of snps need to been imputed using the information coming from the reference panel. in fact, the frequencies of those imputed haplotypes are almost the same in cases and controls. this is probably the reason that we cannot replicate those findings. hopefully, next-generation sequencing will provide high resolution snp data to resolve this issue. another important reason may be that these two cd data sets are from different populations .

similarly, we have analyzed another ra data set  <cit>  from genetic analysis workshop  <dig>  this data set is acquired from north american population. the snps are genotyped by the illumina chip. we also have difficulties to replicate the findings of the ra data set from wtccc. we hope we can get access to more data sets to verify our results in the future.

discussion
the unfaithfulness issue in the high dimensional feature space
in the high dimensional feature space, many features could correlate with each other by chance, which leads to the existence of unfaithfulness and poses a great challenge on feature selection and association analysis. in this work, we only handle the unfaithfulness issue involving two variables , while the unfaithfulness can exist among a huge number of variables. the relationship between the marginal coefficient  and the regression coefficient  is given as follows  <cit> :   

where  is the expectation of marginal coefficient, ρ is the population correlation between xq and xp. if , then  can be close to zero no matter how large βp is. in addition, the number of involved variables could be very big. to exclude the effect of unfaithfulness in feature selection, fan and lv  <cit>  had to make an assumption that there is a c >  <dig> such that  for p =  <dig> ..., s, and then proved that the truly associated variables will be among those having the highest marginal coefficients.

in our simulation study, we only handle the unfaithfulness involving two associated variables x <dig> and x <dig> by using β <dig> >  <dig>  β <dig> <  <dig> and ρ >  <dig> as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the marginal coefficients  and  will be small due to the cancelation given by equation . when β <dig> >  <dig>  β <dig> >  <dig> and ρ <  <dig>  the unfaithfulness also happens. this corresponds to a situation that the minor alleles of both x <dig> and x <dig> increase the diseases risk but x <dig> and x <dig> are negatively correlated, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the simulation result shows that the marginal test and lasso perform poorly. the better performance of beam should be attributed to its first order markov chain designed for the accommodation of correlation. although our exhaustive method performs reasonably well, the direct extension of our method to deal with three or more loci is computationally expensive. therefore, solving the unfaithfulness issue is still challenging.

the relationship between interaction models and unfaithfulness
in this work, we only deal with a two-locus association pattern involving the unfaithfulness. there are many works  <cit>  discussing two-locus associations. most of them belong to the category of interaction analysis . the snp interaction is also referred to as "epistasis". the most common statistical definition of interactions is the statistical deviation from the additive effects of two loci on the phenotype  <cit> . using the same example we discussed in the introduction section, testing interactions between x <dig> and x <dig> is to first fit the regression model  y ~ β1x <dig> + β2x <dig> + β12x1x <dig> and then test the significance of β <dig>  there is no direct connection between β <dig>  and β <dig> in the analysis of unfaithfulness, the relationship between marginal coefficients  and joint coefficients  is given in equation . the interaction term plays no role here. therefore, it is not appropriate to use interaction models to detect associations masked by unfaithfulness.

the relationship between unfaithfulness and confounding
suppose we are studying the relationship between two variables x and y using model . confounding arises when there is another observed variable z which is independently associated with x and y. specifically, we have  for model  and  fot model . when studying the relationship between x and y, it is necessary to account for the confounding effect by using model y ~ βyzz + βyxx. in other words, confounding is more like the situation illustrated in figure  <dig> . readers are referred to  <cit>  for the detailed explanation of confounding.

the unfaithfulness is different. for model  and , both  and  are close to zero. for joint model y ~ β1x <dig> + β2x <dig>  both β <dig> and β <dig> are not zero, as illustrated in figure  <dig> and  <dig> 

biological interpretations
there are two possible biological interpretations. the first interpretation is illustrated in figure  <dig>  consider two loci xp and xq which are positively correlated. when xq increases the disease risk  and xp acts as a protective locus , unfaithfulness happens. the identified associations and their coefficients listed in table  <dig> indicate that these associations indeed exist.

the second interpretation is illustrated in figure  <dig>  consider two loci xp and xq which are negatively correlated. when both xp and xq increase the disease risk , unfaithfulness also happens. this case may be particularly interesting when analyzing snps with low allele frequencies  <cit> . suppose the allele frequencies of both xp and xq are low and thus the mutations happening at these two loci are relatively recent. we can further assume the haplotype a - a does not exist . this implies these two loci are negatively correlated. unfortunately, we do not identify this type of associations. possible reasons include:  the current genotyping chip is designed based on the "common disease/common variant" model  <cit> , the low frequency snps are not directly assayed.  the statistical power of current testing strategy is relatively low to handle rare variants.

the unfaithfulness implications on tagsnps
gwas is considered as a powerful approach to detecting genetic susceptibility of common diseases. such studies require the genotypes of a huge number of snps across the genome, each of which is tested for association with the phenotype of interest. this is generally referred to as the direct test of association, in which the functional mutation is presumed to be genotyped. an alternative approach is to take advantage of the correlation between snps. this approach genotypes a subset of snps, called tagsnps, which are in high linkage disequilibrium with other snps  <cit> . the association tests of tagsnps are used to indirectly infer the association of other correlated snps. this approach is widely used to save genotyping costs in gwas. many tagging methods  <cit>  have been developed to reduce the number of markers to be genotyped. one key assumption in these methods is that the association analysis of a set of highly correlated snps is equivalent with the association analysis of tagsnps of this set. however, the existence of unfaithfulness poses a challenge for these methods. the weak marginal association of a tagsnp does not imply the weak association of the corresponding genome region in which this tagsnp is located. the reason is that some non-genotyped snps correlating with the tagsnps may jointly display strong associations in the presence of unfaithfulness.

in this work, we analyzed the wtccc data generated by the affymetrix  <dig> k chip and a crohn's disease data set generated by the illumina chip. the affymetrix  <dig> k chip spaces snps along the genome and the illumina chip uses the tagsnp design. ld becomes less apparent in the illumina data set and we did not find any association masked by unfaithfulness. this result suggests that it is very difficult to detect these associations by using the tagsnp design. if more snps could be genotyped in the future gwas, we would detect more unknown associations.

CONCLUSIONS
the phenomenon named "unfaithfulness" has been discussed as a mathematical concept in the literature. in this work, we answered the question whether there exist associations masked by unfaithfulness in genome-wide association studies. we developed a simple and fast method to examine all snp pairs and demonstrated that our method is applicable to analyze genome-wide snp data sets. we conducted experiments on both simulated data and seven real data sets from wtccc and identify many associations masked by unfaithfulness. as expected, these identified associations only occur in local area. this implies that only the local search is needed to find such associations.

to date, we can only connect some identified associations to publicly available results from other association studies. as independent data set is limited as this moment, we have difficulties to replicate these findings. the biological interpretation of many findings remains unclear. it would be of great interest if their biological functions could be investigated. in addition, we only handle the two-locus associations in the presence of unfaithfulness. detecting such associations for three or more loci is still an open problem.
