BACKGROUND
p. putida kt <dig> is a ubiquitous bacterium which can break down a variety of organic materials for food. because of its versatile metabolic activities, p. putida kt <dig> is thought to play a pivotal role in the recycling of organic wastes and the degrading of biogenic and xenobiotic pollutants in the environment  <cit> . according to various carbon sources, we want to know the difference of networks according to the substrates. to simplify the culture condition, we selected succinate and benzoate as a sole carbon source. the easy carbon-utilization source, succinate and the required biochemical degradation-requiring benzoate were chosen for the comparison of a network analysis combined with the different proteomic data. an interactome of a species provides important clues about how to interpret metabolic pathways of constituent enzymes and global protein networks, which facilitates understanding the mechanism responsible for the cellular functions. recently, the genomic-scale identification of protein-protein interaction  in model organisms, such as synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> and xanthomonas oryzae, have been published to map the whole protein-protein interaction networks  <cit> . thanks to advanced high-throughput ppi experiments and information technology, many biologists can access large-scale species specific ppi data on the web  <cit> . several web sites have been developed to disseminate ppi data such as point  <cit> , ophid  <cit> , and piana  <cit> . point and ophid systems provide predicted ppi information using sequence homology. piana integrates several proteins and interaction databases. however, these web services do not include the following methods: structure domain or domain-domain interaction, interaction networks in a graphical network viewer, functional annotation, localization, or the physicochemical properties of ppi data.

we constructed a web-based server, putidanet specifically for p. putida using major ppi algorithms. functional and physicochemical annotations are provided using kegg  <cit> , gene ontology  <cit> , amino acid distribution, instability index, isoelectric point, gravy score, and sub-cellular localization. putidanet is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use.

methods
prediction of protein-protein interaction
the prediction of ppi is based on .psimap  <cit> , peimap, and ipfam   <cit> . psimap predicts interactions among proteins by using the blastp algorithm  <cit>  with a common expectation value  cut-off of  <dig> . interactions among domains or proteins for known pdb  http://www.rcsb.org/pdb structures are the basis of the predictions. peimap includes integrating various experimental protein-protein interaction databases such as bind  <cit> , dip <cit> , intact  <cit> , mint  <cit> , hprd  <cit> , cygd)  <cit> , and biogrid  <cit> . psimap and peimap assume that, in terms of unknown proteins, the query tends to interact with its homolog's partners. the most commonly used concept is 'homologous interaction'  <cit> . in this step, we used to recruit homologous sequences using the psi-blast  <cit>  with a cut-off of 40% sequence identity. furthermore, we have aligned the pfam  <cit>  domains of all the p. putida kt <dig> proteins with hmmpfam by the cut-off of  <dig>  .

in order to select more reliable ppis, we developed and used a 'combined score' between any pair of proteins which were predicted by peimap, psimap, and ipfam algorithms. this scoring method is also used by the string server http://string.embl.de <cit> .

protein function annotation
in order to understand the biological function of p. putida kt <dig> proteome, we searched physicochemical properties and cross-reference databases using kegg and go. we used biopython  <cit>  modules to acquire physicochemical properties, including hydropathy profile, gravy score , molecular weight, amino acid distribution, isoelectric point, and protein instability index. in addition, we predicted trans-membrane helices and signal peptides using phobius  <cit>  and signalp  <dig>   <cit>  programs for the sub-cellular localization prediction of p. putida kt <dig> proteome.

putidanet provides cross-reference to public database information such as 1) kegg pathways, 2) go categories, and 3) go-slim  <cit>  through protein id mapping. in order to gain more accurate statistical test results of kegg and go assignment, we added fisher's exact test algorithm .

protein network analysis case study
cell culture and ms/ms analysis
in order to find significant features, we integrated ppi network and proteomic data which were produced as previously described  <cit> . p. putida kt <dig> was pre-cultured at 30Â°c with vigorous shaking in culture media  and then inoculated into  <dig> l culture media containing succinate  or benzoate  as a sole carbon source. the bacteria were harvested at the late exponential phase  and suspended in  <dig> mm tris-hcl buffer . bacteria were disrupted by a french pressure cell  at  <dig>  lb/in <dig>  and soluble protein mixtures were prepared by centrifugation . the protein samples were fractionated by 12% sds-page. the gel lanes were divided into  <dig> fractions according to molecular weight, and the sliced gels were digested with trypsin . the resulting peptide extracts were pooled and lyophilized in a vacuum concentrator. tryptic peptides were dissolved with  <dig> % tfa  solution prior to further 2d-lc fractionation and used for ms/ms analysis using ltq linear ion trap ms . for the database search, the p. putida protein database was downloaded from the national center for biotechnology information http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. tryptic peptides were identified using sequest .

for better accuracy of protein identification by ms/ms analysis, the p. putida protein database and the reverse protein database were used to exclude any false-discovered proteins  <cit> .

sub-network
we acquired the protein lists in culture media including succinate or benzoate. in order to find regulated sub-network by succinate and benzoate, we analyzed betweenness centrality , the number of shortest paths going through a certain node, and degree, the number of interaction partners, using networkaanalyzer, a cytoscape plugin  <cit> . we used the r software containing some packages and welch two sample t-test for p-value  <cit> . also, we found potential functional modules using mcode, a cytoscape plugin that finds clusters  in protein networks  <cit> .

RESULTS
putidanet, a free accessible database with  <dig>  proteins for p. putida kt <dig>  contains  <dig>  ppi partners that have been predicted. using the ppi algorithms, we obtained  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>   predicted ppis except for self interaction. these ppis were around  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  of the p. putida kt <dig> proteins. although the total number of predicted interaction targets is very large, as they are ranked by combined score, experimentalists can select high ranking  ones according to their functional interests.

in order to find features in protein networks, we detected functional modules as highly interconnected sub-networks. as a result, we found five functional modules with kegg pathway information . the functional modules are important ppis because they represent protein complex or sub-pathway sharing biological functions. the modules which have less than a  <dig>  p-value were various metabolic pathways and ribosomes. the metabolic pathway modules describe the characteristics of p. putida kt <dig> which has a high level of metabolic diversity for biodegradation. this high level of diversity enables the bacterium to utilize a wide range of carbon sources. the ribosome is an organelle that coordinates protein synthesis in all cells. the bacterial ribosome consists of more than  <dig> ribosomal subunit proteins and three rrnas. since bacterial cells contain vast amounts of ribosomes, most ribosomal subunit proteins can be observed as main peaks by mass spectrometry.

CONCLUSIONS
putidanet is the integration of mutually complementary protein-protein interaction information for the systematic analysis of pseudomonas putida. the putidanet server is the first web server that provides various kinds of functional information such as a ppi viewer, physicochemical properties, biological pathways, gene ontology, and protein-protein interaction for p. putida kt <dig>  it can assist researchers to access and obtain the information through an automatic annotation for queried proteins. using proteomics data from certain medium conditions, we analyzed the characteristics of p. putida kt <dig> using putidanet. proteomic data gave us the quantitative information of induced proteins at benzoate or succinate culture conditions, which supplements the database. ppi combined with proteomic data can give users more specific information.
