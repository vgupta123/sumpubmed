BACKGROUND
prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among american men  <cit> . due to the high incidence of prostate cancer the biology of the organ has been extensively studied. crucial to our understanding of the cancer process is the biology of prostate development, in particular, the gene expression changes that accompany epithelial cell differentiation. dna microarray technology has revolutionized the field of gene expression profiling and has seen wide application in the study of prostate cancer  <cit>  as well as other types of cancer  <cit> . a byproduct of these studies is the gene expression profiles of most tissues of the human body have been assessed . the next step in understanding how a tissue functions at a molecular level is to determine the transcriptome profile of individual cell types that constitute the tissue. cell-type specific transcriptomes will allow us to more precisely define prostate cell lineages, cell-cell interactions, autocrine or paracrine signaling pathways, and would be useful to identify biomarkers for diseases such as cancer.

the main problem encountered in studies of cells from solid tissue has always been determining a method to separate the cells of interest from the organ. our solution to the cell separation problem was to use collagenase digestion of tissue combined with cell sorting based on cell-type specific cluster designation  antigens  <cit> . a comprehensive cd phenotyping of the constituent cell types of the prostate  <cit>  now makes it possible to sort most cell populations from the tissue by flow cytometry. the use of antibodies targeting cell-surface cd markers to separate blood cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting  is well established, and has been used for microarray analysis  <cit> . in this study, we used magnetic cell sorting  to isolate the major prostatic cell types: luminal secretory and basal cells of the epithelium, and fibromuscular cells of the stroma for transcriptome profiling. endothelial cells were also sorted to represent a cell type not specific to the prostate. analysis of the transcriptomes identified cell specific gene expression signatures and paracrine signaling pathways that are potentially active within the prostate.

RESULTS
specificity of antibodies used in macs
the cd molecules targeted by macs were cd <dig>  for luminal cells, cd <dig>  for basal cells, cd49a  for stromal fibromuscular cells, and cd <dig>  for endothelial cells. immunohistochemistry performed with the antibodies that were used for macs sorting is shown in fig.  <dig> and confirms their specificity for the cell-types that were targeted. the antibodies that primarily recognize basal epithelial cells and luminal secretory cells  show some staining of endothelial cells  <cit> . therefore, the endothelial cell data was used to filter out genes expressed by endothelial cells from the cd <dig> and cd <dig> transcriptomes.

cell type-specific transcriptomes
microarray expression data from the four prostate cell types were compared with each other. raw data is available in the ncbi geo database under the accession number gse <dig>  from our website  <cit> , and in softmatrix format . anova was performed on the data  to determine the effectiveness of macs at enriching the signal of transcript from the target antigen . the cd <dig> and cd49a transcripts were differentially expressed in their respective sorts relative to the other sorts , as were cd <dig> and cd <dig> transcripts , thereby confirming the effectiveness of our sorts. to further assess whether the populations of sorted cells provide accurate representation of the targeted prostate cell types, we compared the expression of genes documented in the literature as primarily expressed by luminal, basal, or stromal cells with our sorted luminal, basal, and stromal datasets . the luminal cell genes cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig>  <cit>  were all found to be differentially expressed in the cd <dig> populations . the basal cell genes cd <dig>  p <dig>  and krt <dig>  <cit>  were also differentially expressed in the cd <dig> populations . finally, the stromal cell genes col6a <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  <cit>  were differentially expressed in the cd49a populations . many of the documented cell type-specific genes such as p <dig> were detected at or near background intensity level in cells that were not targeted by sorting. the specificity of p <dig> protein expression to basal cells was verified by immunohistochemistry and confirmed the array data . these analyses indicated that the transcriptomes generated by macs of prostate tissue were representative of luminal, basal and stromal cells.

comparison of cell type transcriptomes with whole tissue

to assess the value of cell sorting in transcriptome profiling we compared sorted cell expression profiles with those of whole prostate tissue archived in the novartis geneatlas project  <cit> . the data from geneatlas was produced with custom affymetrix human genechips. the genechips we used had  <dig>  probesets in common with the arrays used in the geneatlas project. the  <dig>  probesets represent  <dig>  genes. comparison of the transcriptomes revealed that  <dig>  genes were detected in our sorted cell transcriptomes but not in the whole tissue . the detection of genes in sorted cells but not whole tissue indicated an enrichment of cell-type specific genes by sorting. conversely, a list of genes detected in whole tissue but not in sorted cells was also compiled. initially, there were  <dig>  genes in the list, detection of which could be attributed to blood cells and other non-targeted cell types present in whole prostate tissue. to account for the genes that appeared in whole tissue but not sorted cells we subtracted geneatlas data for whole blood in silico, which reduced the number of genes by 80% to  <dig>  subtracting datasets for cd8+, cd4+, cd34+, and cd14+ cells, which were shown in our previous work  <cit>  to be present in the prostate, reduced the number of genes only detected in whole tissue to  <dig> . of the remaining genes only  <dig> were detected at signal levels greater than  <dig>  which was considered to represent moderate expression . overall the sorted cell dataset included  <dig> % of the genes detected in the whole prostate plus an additional  <dig>  genes not detected in whole tissue.

prostate luminal, basal, and stromal genes
our next analysis was aimed at determining which genes were uniquely detected in each cell type and could therefore serve as an expression signature for that cell type. comparison of the genes detected in each sort by venn diagram revealed an expected similarity between the epithelial cell types where luminal and basal cells have roughly twice the number of genes in common than do luminal and stromal cells . to identify significant unique expression, anova was performed for the genes determined to be present in the sorted cells. a total of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes had significant p-values of <  <dig>  in luminal, basal, and stromal sorts respectively . these genes are likely to represent a cell specific signature for the corresponding cell types. we also note that for some highly expressed genes such as psa signal is detected in non-specific cell types . the non-specific detection is due to low levels of contaminating cells in a sort , however, it is clear from statistical analysis that the only cell type where psa shows significant expression is the luminal cells, as would be expected.

cell specific signaling pathways
determination of cell specific transcriptome profiles allowed us to examine the differential expression of genes involved with signal transduction in the prostate. we chose to investigate the expression of tgfβ family members by applying our expression signatures to the genes that compose the tgfβ pathway as compiled in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes . a group of genes that are assigned to the kegg tgfβ signaling pathway were significantly differentially expressed as determined by anova  in prostate stromal cells relative to basal, luminal, and endothelial cells . the analysis suggested that in prostate stromal cells, autocrine signaling via the classic tgfβ pathway might be reduced by high expression of decorin. tgfβ paracrine signaling from stromal cells to basal and luminal cells appears to occur via tgfβ <dig> since the basal and luminal cells express tgfβ receptors but low to undetectable levels of tgfβ <dig>  however, autocrine and paracrine signaling in the prostate via the bone morpohgeneic protein  signaling-pathway , which is closely related to tgfβ and is a component of the kegg tgfβ signaling system, could be enhanced by high expression of bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> by stromal cells.

discussion
our approach to cell specific transcriptome profiling of solid tissues involves first identifying the specificity of cd cell-surface markers for cell types within the tissue. cd markers with the proper specificity can then be used to target cell types for isolation by cell sorting techniques such as macs. we chose macs as the separation method for this study because the procedure is much faster than facs  and allowed us to minimize the time cells were handled. we determined transcriptome profiles of four main cell types in the prostate: luminal secretory, basal epithelial, stromal fibromuscular, and endothelial cells. it is possible the approximately 18-hour time frame from surgical removal to cell sorting and storage contributed to some differences in the transcriptomes of luminal, basal, and stromal cells. reduction of the processing time should be considered in future studies. however, when we examined macs-sorted prostate cell transcriptomes, the effectiveness of our approach was demonstrated by the fact that luminal secretory, basal epithelial, and stromal fibromuscular transcriptomes differentially expressed genes that are well documented as specific to the prostate cell type we intended to capture by sorting. the transcriptomes revealed that luminal secretory cells were more similar to basal epithelial cells and less similar to stromal fibromuscluar cells, as would be expected for the two epithelial cell types.

the utility of cell specific transcriptomes is demonstrated by the identification of genes predominantly expressed in luminal, basal, or stromal fibromuscular cells of the prostate. to investigate paracrine signaling within the prostate we applied the expression data from our cell specific groups to the genes of the tgfβ and related signaling pathways , which allowed us to identify which cells were expressing components of the pathways in the prostate. we chose to investigate the tgfβ pathway because it had been extensively studied in the prostate and is known to be involved in control of apoptosis and growth of the prostate epithelium  <cit> . our data showed that in the cell types we assayed stromal fibromuscular cells differentially expressed tgfβ pathway members. interestingly, the activity of classical tgfβ signaling through tgfβ receptors may be reduced in prostate stromal fibromuscular cells through an autocrine mechanism mediated by the expression of a negative regulator of tgfβ signaling decorin  <cit> . paracrine signaling from stromal fibromuscular to basal cells also is likely to occur in the prostate since tgfβ receptors i and iii are expressed by basal cells.

although our data indicates that tgfβ signaling via the classic pathway is reduced in stromal fibromuscular cells, activity of the closely related bone morphogenic protein  signaling pathway appears to be enhanced. one result of bmp signal transduction is production of inhibitor of differentiation  proteins  <cit> . id proteins are negative regulators of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors and have been shown to be important in development, the cell cycle, and tumorigenesis. our data indicates that luminal, basal, and stromal cells of the prostate express all four isoforms of the id genes at high levels and that the expression of ids may be controlled by bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> produced by stromal cells. bmp <dig> is known to inhibit ductal budding during development of the mouse prostate  <cit> . recent work in a mouse model system has shown that bmp <dig> heterozygous adult animals have enlarged prostates due to increased branching of the prostate ducts during neonatal development  <cit> . bmp <dig> has also been shown to inhibit growth of the prostate cancer cell line lncap  <cit>  and induce the expression of id <dig>  id <dig>  and id <dig> in cell lines  <cit> . little is know about bmp <dig> with regard to the prostate, although its expression has been observed to be increased in benign prostatic hyperplasia  <cit> . our data suggests that bmp signaling from the stromal fibromuscular cells to epithelial cells may be necessary to maintain the differentiated state of the prostate by inducing expression of id family members 1– <dig> in these cells.

transcriptomes of prostate epithelial, stromal, and endothelial cells provide the basis for assessing the degree to which genes associated with prostate cancer are abnormally expressed. furthermore, cell specific transcriptomes also allow abnormally expressed genes to be assigned to a cell type in the prostate. genes over-expressed in prostate cancer include amacr, hpn, rdh <dig>  and tmprss <dig>  <cit> . confirmation that the source of these gene products is the cancer cell population of these tissues has been provided by immunohistochemical localization studies. our investigation found that in benign tissue very low levels of amacr and hpn transcripts were expressed only by luminal secretory cells, and not by other parenchymal cells, while rdh <dig> and tmprss <dig> were highly expressed in luminal secretory cells, which provides an indication that luminal cells are the origin of some cancers.

with respect to endothelial cells, virtually no work has been done investigating differential expression of molecular mediators of angiogenesis. we anticipate that defining endothelial gene expression patterns will be important in understanding prostate carcinogenesis, since tumor angiogenesis is a generic problem of significance in tumor biology, and studies of other tumors such as colon cancer have found it significant  <cit> . our study provides a normal endothelial transcriptome profile that can serve as a reference for such future studies of prostate tumor angiogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
the transcriptomes of prostate luminal, basal, and stromal fibromuscular cells we have generated are the first such data determined for a solid tissue and are of value for the study of prostate cancer. future investigation of the transcriptomes of cd sorted prostate cancer cell types will allow us to establish more fully their lineage relationship to the normal epithelial cell types and to discover aberrant signaling pathway activation or repression present in cancer. in conclusion, we have reported transcriptome profiles of individual cell types collected from live solid tissue and established a cell sorting methodology that can be used to isolate cells from other tissues which are suitable for transcriptome profiling.
