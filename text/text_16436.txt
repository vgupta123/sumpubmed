BACKGROUND
the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance among bacterial gram-negative pathogens is a serious threat to global health. a particular problem is related to the spread of multidrug resistant gram-negative bacterial infections belonging to the enterobacterial family that are responsible for the highest number of infections for human kind. the rapid increase in carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae that produce carbapenemase enzymes, such as kpc and ndm  <cit> , is of special interest. due to the paucity of novel antibiotics, polymyxins , although introduced in the 1950s, are gaining a renewed interest for treating infections due to said multidrug-resistant infections. polymyxins are cationic polypeptides  <cit>  that act by binding to the lipid a moiety of bacterial lipopolysaccharides , subsequently disrupting the bacterial membrane.

acquired and chromosome-encoded resistance to colistin has been reported among gram-negative bacteria and some species, such as neisseria spp. and serratia spp., are intrinsically resistant to colistin  <cit> . the most common mechanism of acquired resistance involves modification of the lps component of the outer membrane. specifically, resistance occurs due to modification of the 1’ and 4’ phosphate groups of lipid a to neutralize the negative charge and reduce binding of the positively charged colistin  <cit> . the phosphates are modified with 4-aminoarabinose by the aminoarabinose transferase arnt or by the addition of phosphoethanolamine  by pea transferase enzymes  . chromosome-encoded and acquired resistance to polymyxins is associated with mutations found in genes for two-component regulatory systems and result in expression of the transferase enzymes that modify lps  <cit> .fig.  <dig> structure of lipid a of e. coli showing reaction catalyzed by mcr- <dig>  phosphatidylethanolamine’s r <dig> and r <dig> groups are constituted of acyl chains. the phosphoethanolamine moiety that is transferred from phosphatidylethanolamine to lipid a is shown in red. in this reaction, the transfer has been shown to occur to the 4’ position of lipid a, however, transfer can also occur to the 1’ position



the x-ray structures of an arnt transferase as well as the catalytic domain of the neisseria meningitidis  and campylobacter jejuni  pea transferases have been determined . arnt is a membrane protein with a periplasmic domain and is a member of the gt-c family of glycosyltransferases, while the pea transferases have a membrane-spanning domain and a periplasmic catalytic domain . the catalytic domain of the lpta and eptc pea transferases have a similar structure and are members of the sulfatase group with a fold similar to alkaline phosphatase  <cit> .

very recently, a plasmid-encoded lps-modifying enzyme, named mcr- <dig>  that provides colistin resistance has been reported from enterobacteriaceae in china  <cit> . this is an additional source of concern since it is the first transferrable resistance to polymyxin antibiotics. it raises the specter of transferable pan-drug resistance in enterobacteriaceae. indeed, there are also recent reports of the spread of the same mcr- <dig> gene worldwide in community- and hospital-acquired pathogens in humans and in animals . the mcr- <dig> enzyme is  <dig> % and  <dig> % identical to the pea transferases lpta and eptc, respectively, and sequence comparisons suggest the active-site residues are conserved  <cit> . here, we report the x-ray crystal structure of the soluble, periplasmic catalytic domain of the mcr- <dig> enzyme determined at  <dig>  Å resolution. the fold of the mcr- <dig> catalytic domain is similar to that of the lpta and eptc transferases, as expected based on sequence homologies. in addition, many of the presumed active-site residues are conserved, although the number and position of active site zinc ions differ among the structures. the position of binding sites for lipid a and phosphatidylethanolamine are not apparent in the catalytic domain structure, suggesting that they are present in the membrane domain.

RESULTS
crystal structure of the catalytic domain of mcr-1
in order to examine the structural and molecular features of the catalytic domain of mcr- <dig> , we determined its x-ray crystal structure . two soluble domain truncations of cmcr- <dig>  mcr-1Δ1– <dig>  and mcr-1Δ1– <dig>  were produced with an n-terminal his6-tag sequence . it was found that the mcr-1Δ1– <dig> construct produced sufficient amounts of protein for purification and crystallographic studies. diffraction-quality crystals of cmcr-1Δ1– <dig> were obtained only after cleavage of the n-terminal his6-tag. excluding the his6-tag, the cmcr-1Δ1– <dig> protein consists of  <dig> residues with an estimated molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. the crystals diffracted to  <dig>  Å resolution and the phases of cmcr- <dig> were determined by single anomalous diffraction techniques using zinc as the anomalous scatterer. the cmcr- <dig> protein crystallized in the p <dig> space group with one molecule in the asymmetric unit . the determined structure shows a well-defined electron density for a total of  <dig> residues spanning from asp <dig> to arg <dig> fig.  <dig> structure of the catalytic domain of mcr- <dig> phosphoethanolamine transferase. secondary structure elements are depicted as a ribbon model and colored in cyan , purple , and salmon . additionally, the phosphothreonine  <dig> is represented in sticks. right, rotated  <dig> °, a view of the characteristic alkaline phosphatase α/β/α fold of cmcr-1

cmcr- <dig> is a globular protein with an overall hemispherical shape and a centrally located β-sheet composed of seven β-strands sandwiched between α-helical structures . the catalytic domain of mcr- <dig> assumes the α/β/α fold characteristic of the alkaline phosphatase superfamily. the first  <dig> residues of cmcr- <dig> constitute a random loop region that wraps around the surface of the protein. although unstructured, this region was found to be important for the expression and purification of the cmcr- <dig> protein in that the removal of this region  resulted in aggregation and poor purification yields .

upon inspection of the electron density map, a residual density was observed protruding from the side chain hydroxyl oxygen of thr <dig>  the biological function of the enzyme and the tetrahedral shape of the density suggested the presence of a phosphate group covalently attached to the side-chain oxygen resulting from phosphorylation of thr <dig> . the phosphate group was then modeled into this density followed by positional and occupancy refinement, and validation by using difference density maps. the average occupancy and b-factor of the phosphate group atoms following the refinement were  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å <dig>  respectively, indicating that nearly all of the enzyme was in the phosphorylated state. the phosphothreonine  <dig> is located centrally on the flat surface of the hemisphere opposite to the starting β-strand β <dig>  at the n-terminal end of the α <dig> helix . surrounding the phosphothreonine are three zinc ions, which were identified by the anomalous signal and further confirmed by difference maps . based on previous studies of pea transferases, the presence of phosphorylated threonine, and the zinc binding sites, this region of the catalytic domain was inferred as the active site of mcr- <dig>  <cit> .fig.  <dig> structure of the active-site phosphothreonine with associated zinc ions. the phosphothreonine  is represented as a yellow-orange-red stick model and the zinc ions  that surround the phosphothreonine are shown as slate blue spheres. the 2fo − fc simulated annealing difference map of the final refined model contoured at σ =  <dig>  is shown as a gray mesh. zn <dig> is also coordinated by glu <dig> from a neighboring molecule in the crystal. the neighboring mcr- <dig> protein is colored white and labeled with the prefix #2

the catalytic domain of mcr- <dig> contains six cysteine residues and the cysteines form three disulfide bonds between residues cys281/cys <dig>  cys356/cys <dig>  and cys414/cys <dig> . the location of the catalytic domain of full-length mcr- <dig> is presumably on the periplasmic face of the cytoplasmic membrane, based on the predicted five membrane spanning helices in the n-terminal transmembrane domain of the protein and previous results with pea transferases. the cmcr-1Δ1– <dig> construct used for protein expression, however, lacks the transmembrane domain and is expressed in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm. it is possible that, upon cell lysis for purification, the cysteines become oxidized to form the disulfide bonds. the cys281/cys <dig> disulfide bond bridges a loop region with the α3-helix on which the phosphothreonine is located. the cys356/cys <dig> bond is located in an extended loop region that connects the β4-strand and α8-helix and the cys414/cys <dig> disulfide bond is positioned near each end of the α11-helix .fig.  <dig> comparison of the crystal structures of the catalytic domains of mcr- <dig> , eptc   , and lpta   pea transferases and their conserved active-site residues . top panels – all of the enzymes adopt a similar fold and the active-site threonine is in phosphorylated form. the active site phosphothreonine is labeled for each enzyme. disulfide bonds are shown as space-fill spheres and the numbers of the participating residues are labeled. bottom panels – representative active-site residues are shown in stick model together with interacting zinc ions represented as slate blue spheres. the dashed lines represent interacting distances <  <dig>  Å. the mcr- <dig> active site has three zinc ions bound compared to one zinc for eptc and two zincs for lpta. the mcr- <dig> zinc ion that is coordinated by phosphothreonine- <dig>  glu <dig>  asp <dig>  and his <dig> is conserved in eptc and lpta



active-site and protein surface zinc binding sites
there are ten zinc ions in total per protein molecule in the crystal structure of cmcr- <dig>  three zinc ions  are located in the active site of the enzyme as well as an additional zinc ion  that is shared between two adjacent protein molecules in the crystal lattice . zn <dig> is buried in the active site of mcr- <dig> and is tetrahedrally coordinated by a phosphate oxygen of phosphothreonine- <dig> as well as the conserved residues asp <dig>  glu <dig>  and his <dig> . zn <dig> is bound by a phosphate oxygen of phosphothreonine- <dig>  nε <dig> atom of his <dig>  and three waters in a trigonal bipyramidal configuration. zn <dig> is less embedded in the enzyme and is tetrahedrally coordinated by four water molecules. the waters that coordinate zn <dig> and zn <dig> are connected to the protein by an extensive hydrogen bond network. for example, water- <dig>  involved in the binding of zn <dig>  is hydrogen bonded to the side chain oxygen of glu <dig> and the side chain nδ <dig> of asn <dig> . water- <dig> is also hydrogen bonded to water- <dig>  which also interacts with zn <dig> . in addition, water- <dig> forms a bridge between zn <dig> and zn <dig>  another zn <dig> ligand, water- <dig>  forms a hydrogen bond to nε <dig> of his <dig> and is also hydrogen bonded to water- <dig> and water- <dig>  each of which is a zn <dig> ligand . therefore, the waters that coordinate zn <dig> and zn <dig> are part of a network of hydrogen bonds that link the zinc atoms to each other and the protein. zn <dig> is also near the active site and interacts with phosphothreonine- <dig> and water molecules as well as glu <dig> from a neighboring cmcr- <dig> molecule so that zn <dig> serves as a bridge in a crystal contact . the remaining zinc ions are scattered over the surface of the protein and are mainly coordinated by aspartate and glutamate residues. the large number of zinc ions associated with the mcr- <dig> structure is likely due to the fact that the enzyme crystallized in a condition containing  <dig> mm zinc acetate .

test of the effect of a thr285ala substitution on mcr-1-mediated resistance
if thr <dig> is the catalytic nucleophile, mutation of this residue would be expected to greatly decrease mcr- <dig> function. this was tested by mutating this residue to alanine in a plasmid encoding the full-length mcr- <dig> gene with an n-terminal his-tag and measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration of colistin and polymyxin b. the strain containing wild-type mcr- <dig> exhibited minimum inhibitory concentrations  of  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/ml for colistin and polymyxin b, respectively, compared to a mic of  <dig>  μg/ml for the control strain containing the plasmid without mcr- <dig> . mutation of thr <dig> to alanine lowers the colistin and polymyxin b mics to near the control levels . similar results were obtained with the wild-type mcr- <dig> gene and t285a mutant without an n-terminal his-tag, indicating the his-tag does not impair in vivo mcr- <dig> function. to assess whether the t285a mutant is expressed and directed to the membrane, immunoblot analysis was performed using an anti-his-tag antibody . the immunoblot suggests that the t285a mutation does not affect the expression or the membrane location of the mcr- <dig> protein. altogether, these results indicate that thr <dig> is important for mcr- <dig> function and is consistent with it serving as the catalytic nucleophile.table  <dig> minimum inhibitory concentrations  for e. coli containing a plasmid encoding n-terminally his-tagged wild-type mcr- <dig> and mcr- <dig> t285a

structure homology between cmcr- <dig>  ceptc and clpta
the structure coordinates of mcr- <dig> were submitted to the dali server for comparison with other known protein structures. the closest structural homologues are the pea transferases eptc from campylobacter jejuni and lpta from neisseria meningitidis  <cit> . these enzymes had previously been noted as homologues of mcr- <dig> based on primary amino acid sequence homology  <cit> . an amino acid sequence alignment of mcr- <dig> with eptc and lpta is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

the cmcr- <dig> and ceptc enzymes are highly similar and share the majority of their secondary structures . the cmcr- <dig> and ceptc structures have a root-mean-square deviation  of  <dig>  Å between  <dig> residues when matching cα atom pairs. both cmcr- <dig> and ceptc contain three disulfide bonds. the mcr- <dig> cys281/cys <dig> disulfide bond near the catalytic thr <dig> is positioned similarly to the ceptc cys262/cys <dig> bond and the cmcr- <dig> cys414/cys <dig> bond that is distant from the active site is equivalent to the ceptc cys377-cys <dig> pair . the cmcr- <dig> cys356/cys <dig> pair has no equivalent in ceptc. this pair resides in an extended loop between the β <dig> strand and the α <dig> helix in cmcr- <dig>  and this loop is significantly shorter and lacking a disulfide bond in ceptc . in addition, ceptc contains a cys312/cys <dig> disulfide bond near the active site that is also conserved in the clpta enzyme but is not present in cmcr- <dig> . the functional consequences of these differences are currently not known.

the rmsd between  <dig> cα atom pairs of the structures of cmcr- <dig> and clpta is  <dig>  Å. this rmsd is slightly higher than that of cmcr-1/ceptc, but nevertheless, the structures are very similar. the disulfide-bonding pattern of these two enzymes varies in that clpta has ten cysteine residues  that form five disulfide bonds compared to only three in cmcr- <dig>  the cys281/cys <dig>  cys414/cys <dig>  and cys356/cys <dig> disulfide bonds found in cmcr- <dig> all have equivalents in clpta . as noted above, the cmcr- <dig> cys356/cys <dig> pair is in an extended loop between the β <dig> and the α <dig> helix and this loop is truncated in ceptc. similar to cmcr- <dig>  an extended loop is present in this region in clpta and contains a disulfide bond ; however, the conformation of this loop is different than that in cmcr- <dig> . of the two additional disulfide pairs found in clpta but not in cmcr- <dig>  one is cys327/cys <dig>  which is near the active site and has an equivalent in ceptc. in contrast, the second additional clpta disulfide bond  has no equivalent in ceptc or cmcr- <dig>  it is located towards the c-terminus of clpta, where it connects two α-helices. this region is an unstructured extended loop in cmcr- <dig> 

the active sites of mcr- <dig>  eptc, and lpta are highly conserved . all three enzymes contain a threonine residue that likely acts as a nucleophile for attack on the phosphate of the donor molecule phosphatidylethanolamine. this threonine is phosphorylated in all three structures . a bound zinc  is coordinated by the phosphothreonine in mcr- <dig> and this zinc is conserved in the structures of ceptc and clpta . glu <dig>  asp <dig>  and his <dig> also coordinate this zinc in cmcr- <dig> and these residues are conserved in ceptc and clpta. structural equivalents of this zinc and the coordinating residues are also conserved in alkaline phosphatase. therefore, this zinc site appears to be a core component of this family of enzymes and it has been proposed to stabilize the alkoxide of the active-site threonine for nucleophilic attack on the phosphate of the phosphatidylethanolamine substrate for lpta  <cit> .

the cmcr- <dig> his <dig> and his <dig> residues are also conserved in ceptc and clpta . in the cmcr- <dig> structure, his <dig> coordinates an additional zinc  in the active site, while his <dig> does not contact zinc. in the clpta structure, the his <dig> and his <dig> equivalent residues coordinate the second zinc . the differences between cmcr- <dig> and clpta for the his <dig> residue are due to the altered position of the second zinc in cmcr- <dig> compared to clpta . the ceptc active site contains only one zinc, so neither of these his residues coordinates zinc in the ceptc structure. finally, as noted above, mcr- <dig> contains a third zinc that contacts phosphothreonine- <dig> but is not coordinated by other mcr- <dig> residues and a fourth zinc that is bridged by a neighboring mcr- <dig> molecule in the crystal lattice . neither of these zincs is found in the clpta or ceptc structures  <cit> . the peripheral location of these zincs suggests they may not play a role in catalysis and may be a function of the high zinc concentration in the crystallization conditions for mcr- <dig>  the binding of multiple zinc ions by both clpta and particularly cmcr- <dig>  compared to ceptc, is likely due to increased zinc concentrations during crystallization. the functional significance of the additional zinc sites in cmcr- <dig> awaits further study.

discussion
pea transferase enzymes, such as mcr- <dig>  catalyze the lipid-to-lipid transfer of pea from phosphatidylethanolamine to the 1’ or 4’ phosphate positions of lipid a  <cit> . the catalytic domain of mcr- <dig> has the alkaline phosphatase superfamily fold and there is conservation of several residues in the active site compared to alkaline phosphatase. the mechanism of mcr- <dig> and other pea transferases is not known, although it may proceed similarly to alkaline phosphatase  <cit> . the zn <dig> site in mcr- <dig> is common to pea transferases and alkaline phosphatase . in alkaline phosphatase, this zinc stabilizes the alkoxide form of an active site serine for nucleophilic attack on the phosphate of phosphate monoesters  <cit> . in mcr- <dig>  this zinc may stabilize the alkoxide form of the structurally analogous thr <dig> for nucleophilic attack on the phosphate of phosphatidylethanolamine to create an intermediate with thr <dig> linked to pea. binding of lipid a in an appropriate position for nucleophilic attack on the lipid a 1’ or 4’ phosphate on the phosphate of the thr285-pea intermediate could then transfer the group to lipid a. as discussed below, however, there are no obvious binding sites for phosphatidylethanolamine and lipid a on the catalytic domain and insights into the catalytic mechanism await the structure of the entire mcr- <dig> protein in the presence of substrates or substrate analogues.

in support of the catalytic threonine as a nucleophile for attack on a phosphate, this residue is phosphorylated in the cmcr- <dig>  clpta, and ceptc structures  <cit> . this is unlikely to be a true intermediate, however, as there is no indication of electron density for ethanolamine attached to the phosphate. this may be due to expression of the protein without the membrane domain and thus it is not localized to the membrane where the lipid substrates reside.

although the structure of cmcr- <dig> reveals active site similarities to alkaline phosphatase and a putative nucleophilic threonine, the binding sites for the lipid a and phosphatidylethanolamine substrates are not obvious. the mcr- <dig> catalytic domain has a hemispheric shape and the zinc binding pocket containing phosphothreonine- <dig> resides on a relatively flat surface. the structure of the arnt aminoarabinose transferase that also uses lipid a as substrate and, like the pea transferases, acts at the 1’ and 4’ phosphate positions of lipid a, was recently determined  <cit> . the aminoarabinose transferred by arnt to the lipid a phosphates is provided by the lipid carrier undecaprenyl phosphate. although arnt is not homologous to the pea transferases and the structures are not expected to be conserved, it is a lipid-to-lipid transferase with similar substrates and a similar function as pea transferases. the arnt apo-structure revealed cavities that could potentially bind the lipid substrates and a structure with undecaprenyl phosphate indicated a cavity that binds this substrate, thereby also suggesting the binding site of lipid a resides in another large cavity  <cit> . the lipid binding cavities of arnt reside both within the membrane-spanning section and near the periplasmic interface  <cit> . in contrast, no such cavities are apparent in the cmcr- <dig> structure. an important difference between the arnt and cmcr- <dig> structure experiments is that the entire arnt protein structure was determined, including the membrane portion containing  <dig> membrane-spanning helices while only the periplasmic domain structure of mcr- <dig> was solved. it is likely that the membrane domain of mcr- <dig>  with five predicted membrane spanning helices, contributes to the lipid binding sites, which may reside in the interface between domains as suggested previously for lpta  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the high-resolution structure of the polymyxin resistance enzyme mcr- <dig> has been determined at  <dig>  Å resolution. the structure of the catalytic domain of mcr- <dig> reveals conservation of structure, particularly in the active site, with other pea transferases  <cit> . pea transferases are an interesting drug target in that they are present in a wide range of gram-negative bacteria and play a role in modifying the bacterial lipopolysaccharide in response to environmental conditions, including host defenses  <cit> . the structural conservation of the mcr- <dig> active site with other pea transferases suggests that inhibitors of mcr- <dig> may also inhibit chromosomally encoded pea transferases. such inhibitors would not only restore polymyxin susceptibility but also modify the ability of bacteria to avoid host defenses during pathogenesis.
