BACKGROUND
since the publication of the first human reference genome in  <dig>  sequencing technologies have rapidly evolved, leading to increased throughput and reduced cost. currently, one can obtain a complete human genome in less than two weeks at a cost of usd ~ <dig> or less, whereas the human genome project took over a decade and usd ~ <dig> billion to complete. this advance has paved the way for obtaining personal human genomes quickly and inexpensively. comparison of personal genomes and select regions of the genomes against the reference genome has provided a comprehensive view of human genetic diversity
 <cit> . rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of rare disease risk alleles and facilitated the practice of personalized medicine when making treatment decisions, though such applications are at their infancy
 <cit> .

currently, published personal genomes predominantly represent individuals of european ancestry
 <cit> . genomes of individuals representing the yoruba west-african, han chinese, south korean, khoisan and bantu of africa, japanese, and australian aborigines have also been published
 <cit> . recently, an indian male genome was also published
 <cit> . while a few studies have been conducted to understand the genetic diversity across populations in india, none have catalogued genetic variation at the whole genome level of a female individual from the subcontinent
 <cit> . understanding the extent of variations in the indian population will be important for identifying clinically relevant changes in the asian indian subcontinent context.

using a massively parallel sequencing approach, we have obtained the complete sequence of a south asian indian female  genome. we identified over  <dig>  million snps from this genome of which over  <dig>  were found to be private snps. in performing an analysis of clinically relevant variants we have identified snps that indicate susceptibility to multiple sclerosis.

RESULTS
genome sequencing and alignment to the human reference
we generated  <dig>  gb of sequence data  that was aligned to the human reference sequence  using bwa
 <cit> . we aligned  <dig> % of the reads  to the reference sequence resulting in an average coverage of  <dig>  fold across the genome . the coverage depth distribution of the sequenced genome is shown in figure 
1a along with a poisson distribution with the same mean value. compared to the poisson distribution, which has been used to model sequence data in several earlier studies, we observe that the coverage distribution has more weight on both tails. a decrease in the average coverage with increasing gc content in  <dig> kb non-overlapping windows across the whole genome was also observed . while  <dig> % of the reference genome was covered by at least five reads ,  <dig> % of it was covered by at least one read.

we performed a de novo assembly of reads that did not align to the chromosomes in grch <dig>  using soapdenovo
 <cit> . this generated  <dig>  contigs comprising  <dig> , <dig> bases with an average contig length of 412 bp. of these,  <dig> % sequences aligned to the unanchored contigs and chromosomes in grch <dig> and another  <dig> % of the sequences aligned to the alternative human assemblies. about  <dig> % of the assembled sequences aligned to other human sequences in the nt database, while another  <dig> % of the sequences aligned to non-human primates with an e < 10- <dig> 

snps and indels
we identified a total of  <dig> , <dig> single nucleotide variants  in this genome, by comparing it against human reference genome assembly , using methods previously described
 <cit> . the snp calls were further validated using illumina humanomni1-quad beadchipsnp array data. we observed a  <dig> % concordance between the snp calls made using the sequencing data and the snp array, confirming the validity of the sequencing derived snp calls. the single nucleotide variants identified in the saif genome are referred to as snps  in the results below and this does not include single base insertions/deletions. of the total snps identified,  <dig> , <dig>  mapped to gene  coding regions of the genome. given that exons form a small part of the gene coding region, of the total intragenic snps identified, only  <dig> %  mapped to them . this is consistent with the lower mutation rates typically observed with coding regions of the genomes
 <cit> . among the snps in coding exons,  <dig>  are synonymous  substitution that are distributed among  <dig>  genes and  <dig>  are non-synonymous  changes that map to  <dig>  genes. this is consistent with a non-syn:syn  ratio of ~ <dig> expected of a normal genome
 <cit> . of the snps identified,  <dig> , <dig>  mapped to repeat containing regions of the genome
 <cit> . further, we found that about two-thirds of the snps identified in the repeat regions were found in long interspersed elements  or short interspersed elements .

in addition to snps, insertions and deletions  are a class of variations that shape evolution of genomes
 <cit> . in the saif genome, of the total  <dig>  indels identified,  <dig>   were found in gene coding regions. as observed with snps, only  <dig>   of indels  occurred within exons. of the total indels,  <dig>   were found in repetitive regions, proportionally higher than snps that occurred in this region. this very likely reflects the slippage that occurs during replication leading to increased occurrence of indels in repeat regions
 <cit> . further, it is interesting to note that while indels were predominant  in simple repeats , only 2% of the snps were found in the simple repeat regions.

the presence of snps and indels can affect the gene regulatory regions such as transcription factor binding region /promoters and enhancer sites. we first looked at the average enrichment of snps and indels around transcriptional start sites  of known genes. interestingly, we observed an increased snps density around tss, suggesting an important role for variations in modulating expression across individuals
 <cit> . in contrast to snps, there were fewer indels downstream of tss . this likely suggests a need for preserving the promoter length/architecture around tss. we further investigated all conserved tfbr and enhancer sites catalogued by ucsc genome browser
 <cit>  and vista enhancer browser
 <cit> , respectively in the saif genome to understand the extent of variations in these regions. for tfbr, we focused on snps and indels that are present within 5 kb upstream of the genes. we found  <dig>  snps and  <dig> indels within the tfbr and  <dig>  of snps and  <dig> indels in the enhancer sites. the top tfbr snp containing sites included regions adjacent to forkhead box j <dig> transcriptional activator protein, myocyte enhancer factor- <dig> involved in cellular differentiation, brachyury protein involved in mesoderm formation and differentiation, chx <dig> protein involved in progenitor cell proliferation and bipolar cell determination in developing retina, and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma  protein that regulates adipocyte differentiation. in general, we found genes involved in cancer pathways to be enriched for snps in their promoter regions .

coding snps are predominant in olfactory genes
coding snps  can lead to amino-acid substitutions in proteins encoded by the genome. in the saif genome, of the  <dig>  csnps that occur in the protein coding sequence  <dig>  lead to non-synonymous  substitutions . while the synonymous snps  map to  <dig>  genes, the nssnps are distributed among  <dig>  protein-coding genes in the genome. to understand the significance of the csnps, we assessed their enrichment in kegg pathways using david
 <cit> . while distribution of both ssnps and nssnps was significantly enriched  in ecm-receptor interaction pathway genes, only the olfactory transduction pathway genes showed a statistically significant enrichment for nssnps . this is consistent with the higher levels of polymorphism observed in human olfactory gene family
 <cit> . the nssnps included  <dig>  missense substitutions and  <dig> non-sense mutations that lead to premature stop . genes with premature stop included casp <dig>  a cysteine protease involved in inflammation and innate immune response, and or1b <dig>  an olfactory receptor interacting with odorant molecules in the nose. the casp <dig> protein contains an n-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domain  and a c-terminal catalytic cysteine protease domain characteristic of caspase family of proteins . the non-sense mutation observed in the saif genome codes for a truncated casp <dig> protein that contains just the n-terminal card domain. recent re-sequencing studies have shown that this truncated form of casp <dig> confers resistance to sepsis and is predominant across many populations
 <cit> . another non-sense mutation in the saif occurred in the or1b <dig>  which encodes a g-protein coupled olfactory receptor. the or1b <dig> snp leads to truncation of the 7-transmembrane receptor domain present in or1b <dig> . this truncated variant of or1b <dig> protein has been observed in a recent study
 <cit>  and is thought to affect metabolism of serum cholinesterase
 <cit> . overall, our assessment of the effect of the nssnps using sift
 <cit>  indicates that  <dig>  are likely damaging .

unlike snps, indels in coding regions, in addition to non-sense mutations, can lead to frame shift changes. of the  <dig> coding region indels,  <dig> are in-frame and  <dig> lead to frame-shift change . genes where the indel leads to a frame-shift includes hif3a, hypoxia inducible factor  <dig> alpha subunit, thought to be a negative regulator of hypoxia-inducible gene expression; mmp <dig>  a matrix metallopeptidase involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix for both normal physiological and disease processes; and hnf1a, a transcription factor required for the expression of several liver-specific genes. the frame-shift at position  <dig> in mmp <dig> protein introduces a premature stop codon at  <dig>  this results in loss of zinc-dependent metalloprotease and hemopexin-like repeat domain, leading to a truncated mmp <dig> protein that lacks a catalytic domain . sift analysis of the indels indicated  <dig> indels to be deleterious .

comparison and novel variants
we compared saif snps against those from other published personal genomes, the variations from the  <dig> genomes project and dbsnp database . the personal genomes used to perform the comparison had a sequencing coverage of at least 10x. shared snp sites, where both the saif genome and the genome it is compared to carry a snp, provide a measure of the degree of similarity between the genomes. we also compared the indels found in the saif genome with those reported by the  <dig> genomes project.

snps level comparison of the saif genome found that this individual shared  <dig> % of the snp sites with na <dig>  genome,  <dig> % with the na <dig>  genome,  <dig> % with the venter  genome,  <dig> % with the na <dig>  genome,  <dig> % with the na <dig>  genome,  <dig> % with na <dig> ,  <dig> % with yh  genome,  <dig> % with sjk  genome,  <dig> % with abt  genome,  <dig> % with irish  genome,  <dig> % with kb <dig> ,  <dig> % with the recently published indian male genome
 <cit> ,  <dig> % with dbsnp  <dig>  and  <dig> % with  <dig> genomes project variation collection.

overall, we found that  <dig> %  of the snps and  <dig> %  of the indels to be unique to saif genome . the complete list of novel snps and indels is provided in additional file
1: table s <dig>  of the novel snps,  <dig>   mapped uniquely to genes,  <dig>   mapped specifically to repeat regions,  <dig>   mapped to both gene coding and repetitive regions and  <dig>   mapped to other regions of the genome. further, of the total novel snps that mapped to coding regions,  <dig> led to protein level alterations . genes having novel non-sense substitutions include tsg <dig>  a phosphoprotein implicated in tumorigenesis and the cd <dig> gene that plays a role in hematopoiesis. further, assessment of the protein altering novel snps using sift predicted  <dig> of these to be likely damaging.

mtdna analysis
mitochondrial dna  sequence is widely used to understand the maternal genetic history of human populations
 <cit> . analysis of the saif mt genome showed that it had  <dig> snps  compared to the cambridge reference sequence . the closest mtdna sequence of saif among the mtdna in genbank was ay <dig>  belonging to u1a <dig> haplogroup . this sequence was reported from a study involving the indian population
 <cit>  and contained  <dig> nucleotide differences compared to the saif mt genome. therefore, the most related haplogroup with the saif mt genome was the u1a <dig> haplogroup. this is consistent with the fact that the saif individual is from the southern indian state of kerala where the frequent occurrence of u <dig> haplogroup has been previously reported
 <cit> . the coalescence time for the u1a lineage was estimated to be about  <dig> kya . this deep divergence and genetic distance between saif and its closely related haplogroups suggest that the saif mt genome belongs to one of the distinctive lineages within the u1a haplogroups.
 <cit>  has  <dig> snps and the kb <dig> southern african
 <cit>  had  <dig> snps in comparison to rcrs.

snps with health and medical relevance
we assessed csnps identified in the saif genome using annotations in snpedia and omim for their health and disease relevance. this analysis identified  <dig> and  <dig> csnps with implications in health and disease from snpedia and omim databases
 <cit> , respectively . interestingly, this analysis revealed several snps with implications for susceptibility to cancer and cardiovascular diseases. the cancer susceptibility snps included the variation in sdhb gene , responsible for cowden-like syndrome, resulting in enrichment of carcinomas of human breast due to downstream inactivation of pten
 <cit> . we also found an exon  <dig> brca <dig> variant ,
 <cit>  and an epcam variant identified in chinese population  that are associated with increased risk for breast cancer. further, a snp in cenpf gene  that occurs in the saif genome is associated with a poor breast cancer survival
 <cit> . other snps with increased cancer susceptibility include fcgr2a h166r  associated with increased risk for non-hodgkin’s lymphoma
 <cit> , ankk <dig> e713k  involved in advanced adenoma recurrence, hnf1a s487n , mmp <dig> q166r , and xpc q939k  variants associated with lung cancer, atg16l <dig> t137a  with crohn’s disease, and ogg <dig> p332a  associated with bladder and gall-bladder cancer in japanese, chinese and indian populations. an atr  variant found in the genome has been associated with a poorer response to gemcitabine and radiation therapy in pancreatic cancer
 <cit> . we also found a protective snp that occurs in the pon <dig> gene  that is known to lower  risk for ovarian cancer
 <cit> . two common missense variations in elac <dig> gene  implicated in genetic susceptibility to heredity prostate cancer were found in the saif genome. this while not of direct significance to saif individual, could be of relevance to the male children, if any
 <cit> .

the cardiovascular disease associated snps found in this individual include those in lrp <dig>  and mmp <dig>  both of which increase risk for myocardial infarction, ros <dig>  variation associated with increased coronary heart disease, akap <dig> snp  associated with cardiac conductivity defect susceptibility and adrb <dig> variant  implicated in higher risk of cardiac events. also, two snps in the pon <dig>  show a high risk of cardiovascular disease
 <cit>  and a higher risk of coronary artery disease
 <cit> . a snp in snx <dig>  is linked to elevated risk of coronary heart disease but has also been shown to be associated with better response to statins and may be of clinical significance
 <cit> . other snps affecting cholesterol levels , familial obesity  and hypertension susceptibility  were also found in the genome.

in addition to this, several other snps associated with alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, tuberculosis susceptibility and macular degeneration were also detected. a snp in icam <dig> , associated with increased resistance to malarial infection, originally identified in a study of over  <dig> indian individuals
 <cit> , was also observed in the saif genome. it must be noted that a majority of the snps of health relevance used to annotate the coding snps were derived from studies involving western populations. hence, validating the relevance of these in the context of asian indian population will require controlled studies in a cohort representative of the indian subcontinent.

besides assessing the csnps using snpedia and omim, we performed a comprehensive assessment of predicted genetic risk of the saif genome for  <dig> diseases using varimed
 <cit> . as described recently
 <cit> , we first estimated the pre-test probability using the prevalence of each disease according to the age, gender, and ethnicity of saif. using this analysis of the saif genome we found  <dig> diseases that had post-test probability >5% .

we further assessed the relative genetic risk of saif against gujarati indians in houston  population represented in hapmap iii. we used the set of disease snps measured in both saif and gih, and recalculated the likelihood ratio  for saif and each of  <dig> gih individuals. we found that the saif individual had a higher genetic risk than 80% of gih for eight diseases . intersecting both results, we found that saif had a high genetic risk for four diseases, including multiple sclerosis , uterine leiomyoma , asthma , and obesity .

saif’s high genetic risk on multiple sclerosis is based on a rare heterozygous ag variant at rs <dig> in hla-dra , which appears in 4% gih individuals. multiple studies have linked the presence of the “a” allele with an increased risk for multiple sclerosis in american, australian, british, canadian, dutch, mixed european, and serbian populations
 <cit> . international multiple sclerosis genetics consortium used this allele as a proxy for the drb1* <dig> allele, which had been demonstrated as a causal variant for multiple sclerosis and validated in animal models in omim . this variant has also been validated as a functional regulatory variant, with evidence from transcription factor binding site, eqtl, and dnase peak from regulome db  with data from encode.

in addition to multiple sclerosis, saif had a high genetic risk of uterine leiomyoma, driven by a rare heterozygous ct variant at rs <dig> . the t allele had been validated to increase the risk of uterine leiomyoma with an odds ratio of  <dig>  and p-value =  <dig>  × 10- <dig> in japanese women
 <cit> . a high genetic risk for asthma and obesity were also identified in the saif individual
 <cit>  .

snps of pharmacogenomic relevance
an individual’s snps can be used to predict adverse drug reactions and also manage the dose of drugs prescribed. in order to understand snps of pharmacogenomic relevance, we evaluated saif variants using annotations present in the pharmgkb database
 <cit>  and a set of published snps relevant for drug interactions. we identified  <dig> snps with pharmacogenomic relevance based on pharmgkb . we identified  <dig> actionable snps from literature as it pertains to treatment with various drugs, some of which are also represented in the pharmgkb . as india has a high burden of diabetes, we looked at the saif genome for a snp in atm previously associated with metformin response
 <cit> . metformin is a drug widely prescribed to manage blood sugar levels in diabetics. we found a gg  variant in atm in the saif genome and this is associated with positive response to metformin
 <cit> . fda in the us has recommended testing for snps that help in deciding the dosage of warfarin, used as a blood thinner. based on the three snps  found in the saif genome, we conclude that a typical dose of warfarin is not likely to cause bleeding. given that the saif genome snps predicted an increased risk for multiple sclerosis, we looked at genes with snps that predict response to therapy in the context of multiple sclerosis. we found a ct variant  in gpc <dig>  which is associated with typical response to beta interferon therapy in relapsed multiple sclerosis patients. besides these expected drug responses, we have identified additional ones based on the saif genome and they are detailed in table 
 <dig> 

discussion
we have sequenced the genome of a female from kerala in southern india and identified  <dig> , <dig> snps and  <dig>  short indels. comparison with published personal genomes revealed that saif shared ~50% of the snps with each of the personal genomes published so far and had  <dig>  private snps. of the total snps detected, we identified  <dig>  missense substitutions and  <dig> non-sense mutations. we found olfactory genes to be enriched for non-synonymous snps suggesting that this family of genes may be under reduced evolutionary constraint in humans. besides the nuclear genome, analysis of the mitochondrial genome showed that saif mitochondria belonged to the u <dig> haplogroup which is known to occur in the southern indian state of kerala.

snps in personal genomes can be used to assess disease risk, carrier status and drug response/interaction. we have assessed the saif genome using omim, snpedia and varimed databases for snps with health and disease consequences. we identified higher risk for multiple sclerosis, among other diseases. drug response related snp assessment revealed that the saif genome carried a snp in the atm gene that predicts a favorable response to metformin used in treating diabetes. these and the other annotations made using experimentally verified variants will very likely be used by physicians for counseling and making treatment decisions.

a recent study on variations in india using snp array suggest that genetic diversity within india is at least three times that observed within europe
 <cit> . in india, burden of recessive genetic disorders is predicted to be high and likely to be unique within each population group
 <cit> . additional personal genomes from indian subcontinent that represent population groups within india will be critical to assessing the variation and disease burden.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we report the first complete sequence of a south asian indian female from the state of kerala in india. the availability of this genome and the variants identified is a first step in understanding the genetic diversity in the indian subcontinent. in addition, the clinically relevant changes identified in this personal genome, along with further studies on additional genomes from this region, should provide a comprehensive assessment of the disease burden in the indian population.
