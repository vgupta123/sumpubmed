BACKGROUND
endometriosis is cracterized by presence of endometrial glands and stroma in ectopic locations, as pelvic peritoneum, ovaries, and rectovaginal septum, affecting 6 % to 10 % of women in reproductive age  <cit> . endometriosis can cause dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, chronic pelvic pain and infertility  <cit> . the prevalence of endometriosis in women experiencing pain, infertility, or both is as high as 35 %–50 %  <cit> . the pathogenesis of endometriosis remains controversial. currently, an increasing number of studies have addressed whether changes in immune reactivity may facilitate development of endometriosis . in this sense, it has been strongly suggested that a fundamental part of immunologic system, the natural killer cells , are an important part of this process  <cit> .

nk cells are large granular lymphocytes, representing about 5 % to 15 % of peripheral blood lymphocytes  <cit> . nk cells are an important component of the innate immune system and have been extensively studied for their ability to defend the organism against infections and malignancies  <cit> . nk cells kill their targets by direct lysis or by the release of cytokines and chemokines  <cit> . these reactions are carefully balanced and the participation of cytokines such as interferons α and β and interleukin  <dig>  are essential  <cit> . in addition to increasing the traffic of nk cells to sites of injury, il- <dig> activation has a strong proliferative effect on nk cells  <cit> . studies have shown that nk cells activated by il- <dig>  are able to infiltrate and destroy tumors in lungs and livers of mice  <cit> , suggesting that activated nk cells may be of therapeutic importance in the setting of cancer. recently, a study demonstrated that activation of leucocytes with il- <dig>  induced a persistent reduction of endometriosis lesions in female rats  <cit> . on this basis, is possible that il- <dig> activated nk cells could form the basis of a new treatment alternative for patients with endometriosis.

RESULTS
our analyses show that exogenous a-nk cells injected via the i.v or i.p routes very efficiently infiltrate endometriosis lesions . in non-treated animals, endogenous nk cells are only found in very low numbers in endometriosis lesions . however, in animals treated with a-nk cells plus il- <dig> or with il- <dig> alone, the density of endogenous nk cells in the endometriotic lesions increased at least  <dig> fold .fig.  <dig> experimental endometriosis lesions 4 weeks after injection of endometrial tissue. donor mice: gfp transgenic c57bl/6; recipient mice: wild-type  c57bl/ <dig>  all pictures show endometriosis lesions from different animals

discussion
endometriosis affects almost  <dig> % of women in the reproductive age. the pathogenesis of endometriosis remains controversial. however, many recent studies have implicated the immune system and especially nk cells in endometriosis development. on this basis, nk cells, a fundamental part of immunologic system seems to play an important role in endometriosis development. several of these studies have reported a decrease in cytotoxicity of nk cells in the peritoneal fluid from women with endometriosis  <cit> . lack of nk cell cytotoxicity could, at least in part, facilitate the attachment of endometriotic cells at ectopic sites  <cit> . however, the reason for the decrease in cytotoxicity of peritoneal fluid nk cells remains to be clarified, but only few studies have assessed the role of nk cells in target endometriosis lesions. velasco and cols found that treatment of female rats with endometriosis with il- <dig>  resulted in the activation of leucocytes and a significant reduction in the size of endometriotic lesions compared to the untreated group  <cit> . however, when they look for activated nk cells, it seems to be in low number compared with control. differently, in our study we show that when activated by il <dig>  endogenous nk cells starts to migrate to the lesion becoming able to infiltrate it and that this effect seem to be potentiate when exogenous a-nk were injected via i.v or i.p. this important evidence shown at least in part that nk cells seem really play an important role on pathogenesis of endometriosis. we believe that ours findings were different from those found for velasco’s, first due the difference in experimental model, and second due the difference in protocols accessed by each study. while we collected tissue three days after a-nk cells induction, the other study wait 3 months to collect the simples, maybe this long time has influenced in activity and quantity of nk cells. on the other hand, due our short-term protocol, was not possible observe changes in lesions size. despite of this, for the first time we show that activated nk cells are able to track and infiltrate endometriosis lesions and the best way to promote this effect is through combination of endogenous a-nk cells and exogenous a-nk cells injected via i.p.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show at least in part that exogenous activated nk cells enhance trafficking of endogenous nk cells to endometriotic lesions. it seems to be a very promising result, and if confirmed that a-nk cells are efficient in killing endometriosis lesions, maybe in the future we could use this approach as an alternative treatment for women with endometriosis. therefore, we believe it is necessary understand better decreasing of cytotoxicity of nk cells in peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis and why endogenous nk cells seems not to be able to attack endometriosis and also if exogenous a-nk cells despite infiltrate the lesions, are really able to kill endometriosis.
