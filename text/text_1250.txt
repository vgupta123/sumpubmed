BACKGROUND
the investigation of metagenomes, which sequences dna from mixed environmental samples directly, has provided insights into microbial communities, and is now widely used to study various living microorganisms as a system  <cit> . the major goal of metagenomic studies is to determine the systemic properties of a microbial community, including the genetic, metabolic, ecological, physiological and behavioral aspects of all community members  <cit> . some high-throughput pipelines have been constructed for high-performance computational analysis of metagenomic data  <cit> . the pipelines facilitate taxonomic binning of huge amounts of sequencing data by referring to databases of known microbial genomes  <cit> . based on the above approaches, recent investigations have revealed enormous variations among the microbiomes of diverse environments, such as human intestinal and salivary microbiota  <cit> , microbial communities growing on sunken whale skeletons  <cit> , and open ocean communities  <cit> .

to study genetic materials from natural environmental samples, sanger sequencing technologies have been used for generating dna sequences  <cit> . yet, much more metagenomic datasets were conducted using next generation sequencing  technologies  which yield shorter fragments ranging from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp  <cit> . as huge amount of sequencing data were produced, analysis tools have become a critical player in data interpretation  <cit> . for example, when scaffolds and contigs are assigned to phylogenetically related groups, glimmer  <cit> , genemark.hmm  <cit> , and metagene  <cit>  are widely used to identify putative coding sequences . subsequently, the taxonomic assignment of cdss is performed using blast  <cit>  or other homology search tools  <cit>  with sequence databases. recently, some advanced taxonomic assigning tools like megan  <cit> , phymm  <cit> , phylopythia  <cit>  were published. however, the majority of the reads only contain partial coding regions. thus, they were usually unidentified because of the limited match length. for example, in two distal gut microbiomes, approximately 40% of  <dig>  high-quality reads were discarded after sequence assembly. moreover, approximately 40% of  <dig>  cdss predicted by using the glimmer package were excluded from further analysis due to insignificant blast scores  <cit> . in  <dig> healthy japanese individuals, 33% of  <dig> , <dig> shotgun reads failed to assemble, and 25% of  <dig>  cdss  were excluded from further analysis  <cit> . it is estimated that existing analytical methods discard approximately 30-40% of metagenomic data from sanger approaches  <cit> . considering the drawback, we were motivated to re-analyzed the discarded reads of metagenomes generated using sanger sequencing.

to overcome the limitations of current binning approaches, which rely heavily on the blast hit score, we propose a method for assigning reads discarded by the original studies . the new approach combines the blast search scores  and the concept of conserved gene adjacency. the rationale is based on the theory that genomes are shuffled, so local gene-order conservation reflects the specificity of microbial organisms  <cit> . for example, the conservation of the gene order in prokaryotes is known to be an important feature; hence, it has been used in function inference  <cit> . since gene order conservation is a genomic feature that is extensively conserved between closely related species  <cit> , the trend should be universal in prokaryotic genomes  <cit> . furthermore, it is known that overlapping gene pairs are frequently observed in microbial chromosomes  <cit>  and conserved across species  <cit>  in all three transcriptional directional classes: unidirectional , convergent , and divergent   <cit> . therefore, we argue that, if a genomic fragment contains two or more adjacent cdss that are identified by blastx, it is reasonable to assign the sequence by using the proposed strategy, which combines two blastx hit scores and the adjacency of the two genes.

a recent study showed that the average gene density in prokaryotic genomes is one gene per  <dig>  nucleotides  <cit> , which is close to the sequence length yielded by whole genome shotgun sequencing. thus, we were aware that the read length would be the limitation of this approach. in our study, we only applied the analyses to conventional sanger reads, which have higher potential to contain adjacent gene information than ngs. we first used simulated metagenomes to estimated the ratio of discarded singletons that may contain at least two neighboring genes  <cit> . we found that approximately 49% of discarded singletons contained gene pairs in all three transcriptional directional classes. subsequently, we collected data from conventional metagenome projects that were generated via sanger sequencing, and re-analyzed the fragments that were discarded from two types of metagenomic data,  <dig> healthy japanese individuals  <cit>  and the skeletons of whale carcasses   <cit> . two types of genomic fragments, assembled contigs and raw single reads , were analyzed separately. the results showed that between  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the discarded data were assigned to taxa. furthermore, the microbial compositions using discarded data and those reported in previous studies  <cit>  were highly consistent in the family and phylum ranks. therefore, we conclude that the proposed metagenomic sequencing approach provide a more comprehensive overview of the functional and taxonomic content of a microbiome.

RESULTS
ngs technology facilitates the investigation of microbial communities. because of the enormous number of short dna fragments in metagenomic datasets, some bioinformatics tools, such as megan  <cit> , phymmbl  <cit>  and tacoa  <cit> , have been developed for phylogenetic classification. however, current taxonomic binning methods have to discard a large number of sequences due to low homology scores. to address this problem, we developed a method that assigns discarded genomic fragments by combining the blast search scores and the criterion of gene adjacency. first, to assess the feasibility of our approach, we used simulated metagenomes to analyze the distribution of the number of cdss in discarded singletons. in the simulated data sets, which had different levels of complexity , we found that nearly half of the discarded singletons contained two or more partial cdss , suggesting that some of the discarded datasets could still be assigned to taxa.

binning discarded metagenomic fragments
we used two kinds of metagenomes from whale fall samples  and healthy japanese individuals  respectively . since the singletons were not available in the public domains, we repeated the assembly strategies and obtained similar datasets. as shown in table  <dig>  between  <dig>  and  <dig>  discarded contigs were collected from three whale fall microbiomes; and for the japanese individuals, between  <dig>  and  <dig>  discarded singletons were collected after the assembly process. under the proposed approach, between  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the discarded contigs in the whale fall samples were assigned to taxa. in the group of japanese individuals, we were able to assign between  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the discarded singletons  to taxa. based on the results, we suggest that the proposed binning strategy can be applied for re-analyzing the discarded reads of metagenomic data.

the consistency between binning with discarded fragments and that in the original studies was tested by the pearson correlation coefficient .

the consistency of binning with discarded fragments compared to the strategies in previous studies
to validate our approach, we compared the proposed taxonomic binning strategy using discarded datasets with the strategies in previous studies  <cit> . we used pearson correlation coefficient to evaluate the similarity of the two groups. for taxonomic assignments using homology search tools, reads were assigned down to the class, order, family, and genus ranks  <cit> . therefore, we separated the comparison into phylum and family ranks to describe the similarity between the original results and our binning results. we found that the results derived by our taxonomic binning strategy and those reported in previous studies were consistent. the correlation coefficients were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the phylum rank and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the family rank . for example, the compositional view of japanese individual f1-u showed a high degree of similarity between the two binnings . the correlation coefficient was  <dig>  in both the phylum rank and the family rank. the consistency between the two datasets indicates that taxonomic binning using discarded data is as representative as the binning strategies used in previous studies.

to further evaluate our approach, we used  <dig>  simulated singletons  for taxonomic binning to quantify the performance of our analysis. as shown in table  <dig>  the discarded singletons with the length of ~ <dig> kb  were correctly assigned with sensitivity between  <dig> - <dig> % and specificity between  <dig> - <dig> % between phylum and genus . the hit number is positively correlated with the sensitivity but is negatively correlated with specificity, while the e-values do not seem to affect accuracy. in comparison with same method but without considering the gene adjacency, our approach showed a slight decrease in specificity but increased in sensitivity. for example, in family and genus ranking, the sensitivity is approximately four times higher than the method that does not consider gene adjacency . furthermore, because of the lack of similar analysis for discarded reads, here, we referred to previous studies using whole metagenomic data. for example, in tacoa  <cit> , which reportedly performed better than phylopythia  <cit> , the average sensitivity for binning  <dig> kb singletons ranged from 71% in the superkingdom rank to 22% in the class rank; and the average specificity ranged from 73% in the superkingdom rank to 64% in the class rank. although our dataset sources  were different from tacoa , the results indicate that with suitable filters and criteria, reliable information in the discarded data can be retrieved.

criteria considering gene adjacency and without considering gene adjacency were tested separately. p: phylum, o: order, f: family, g: genus. sn and sp denote sensitivity  and specificity .

it has been observed that hgt  occurs frequently in prokaryotes  <cit> . such a mechanism of genetic variability within a species may create bias in taxonomic binning based on a traditional homology search method. however, not all genes are equally itinerant, and they do not exhibit the same hgt behavior  <cit> . preferential hgt correlates strongly with the functions of different types of genes. for example, informational genes  are far less likely to be transferred horizontally than operational genes  because they are complex systems  <cit> . in genome wide studies using  <dig> prokaryotes  <cit> , the authors reported  <dig>  hgt events in a total of  <dig> , <dig> orfs, but the horizontal transfer clusters  were relatively low . our approach considers the blast search scores and the criterion of conserved gene adjacency. hence, the bias resulting from hgt should be relatively low compared to that of other approaches using a single hit.

CONCLUSIONS
since a large amount of metagenomic data generated using sanger sequencing fails to satisfy the cut-off for taxonomic binning, we introduce a criterion based on a genomic feature, namely, the conservation of gene adjacency between prokaryotes. our analysis suggests that considering the conserved neighboring gene adjacency reduces the amount of data discarded by current methods. in fact, a latest update of megan software has incorporated similar analysis for pair reads, and the assignment for lca-gene has been improved considering the conserved adjacency  <cit> . in addition, we are aware that the vast majority of recent metagenomic datasets were produced by ngs technologies , and our analysis can only be applied to datasets with longer reads, such as sanger. yet, roche's first-generation instrument,  <dig> gs  <dig> , yielded 100-bp reads, the latest version gs junior system  already yielded demonstrably higher read lengths, exceeding  <dig> bp. hopefully, the limitations of sequence length will be resolved in the near future, and our study will provide a basis for analyzing metagenomic data.
