BACKGROUND
insects use chemical cues for most tasks they encounter during their life history. over long distances, airborne chemical stimuli guide insects to food sources, mates, and places for oviposition . within close range, olfaction as well as gustation are used to discriminate between different food qualities, to avoid toxins or harmful microbes, to communicate intra- or interspecifically, to identify suitable mating partners, and to find appropriate egg-laying sites . because of insects’ devastating impact on agriculture and stored food products, as well as their ability to serve as vectors for detrimental diseases, insect olfaction has become an important research field in biology  <cit> .

chemical signals are typically perceived within specialized antennal and palpal cuticular structures, the olfactory or gustatory sensilla. these chemosensory sensilla form a hollow structure filled with aqueous lymph and harbor the dendritic branches of the chemosensory neurons , namely the olfactory  or gustatory sensory neurons   <cit> . they are divided into several sub-types according to their different morphology  <cit> . the volatile molecules enter the cavity through wall pores finally to reach and activate the chemoreceptors on the dendrites of the osns. to enhance olfactory sensitivity and specificity, odorant binding proteins  or potentially chemosensory proteins  facilitate the translocation of many, mostly hydrophobic, chemicals through the aqueous lymph  <cit> . in insects, typically three different receptor families are involved in chemoreception  <cit> : the ionotropic glutamate-like receptors   <cit> , the gustatory receptors   <cit> , and the odorant receptors  . the irs are evolutionarily highly conserved chemoreceptors involved in protostome olfaction  <cit> . they contain three transmembrane domains and form functional heteromers between an odor-specific ir and a co-receptor  the grs are seven transmembrane receptors found across arthropods  whose quaternary structure , as well as the signal transduction mechanism  <cit> , are still under debate. the typical ors are seven transmembrane receptors found in pterygote insects  <cit>  that form functional heteromers with the atypical  odorant receptor co-receptor  . their signal transduction mechanism is currently discussed and they may either form an ionotropic receptor complex that is regulated by second messengers or be functional metabotropic receptors . the described influence of g-proteins and affiliated second messengers on insect olfaction supports both mechanisms . moreover, sensitive pheromone detection requires the or/orco complex to interact with a sensory neuron membrane protein  related to the scavenger receptor cd <dig> . besides the perireceptor events involved in effective activation, the high temporal resolution of olfactory reception probably also requires signal termination, which is supposedly mediated by secreted or membrane-bound odorant-degrading enzymes  .

activation of the described chemoreceptors elicits action potentials in the csns that are further transmitted via the antennal nerve to the antennal lobe , the first integration center of the olfactory pathway in the brain, or for gsns, to the primary gustatory center of the gnathal ganglion   <cit> . the al of insects consists typically of spherical sub-compartments, the olfactory glomeruli  <cit> . usually osns express only one typical  or gene and all antennal osns expressing the same typical or converge into the same olfactory glomerulus, creating a chemotropic map-like representation of chemical coding in the al , known as the central dogma of olfaction  <cit> . in drosophila melanogaster, the or/orco and ir derived sensory information from the antennae and the maxillary palps is processed in the al  <cit> , whereas in several hemimetabolous insects, csns from the palps converge typically in the lobus glomerulatus , next to but outside the al . in the al, olfactory information from the osns, is processed by a complex network of local interneurons . the processed odor information is further relayed by distinct antennal lobe tracts  formed by the projection neurons  to the mushroom body  and the lateral horn   <cit> . the mbs are higher-order integration centers for multiple processed sensory information and are responsible for odor discrimination, associative learning, as well as memory storage and retrieval. the lhs receive odor input directly from the als or indirectly from the mbs, decode the quality and intensity of the information, and finally trigger immediate odor-driven behavior .

despite the evolutionary success and ecological as well as economic importance of beetles  <cit> , little is known on the neuroanatomy, genetics, or biochemistry of their olfactory pathway. within the coleoptera, the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum has become the prime model organism for developmental biology and pest management  <cit> . with its fully annotated genome  and the multiple powerful genetic tools – such as systemic rna interference  <cit> , insertional mutagenesis  <cit> , and transgene-based misexpression systems  <cit>  – t. castaneum represents an eligible beetle model organism for olfaction. in the current study, we present a substantial overview of the olfactory pathway in t. castaneum, covering the morphology of the sensilla and the antenna, all major neuropils including al, mb, lh, lg, and the gnathal olfactory center , a previously undescribed glomerularly organized neuropil in the gng. additional support for the importance of the gnathal input into olfaction is provided by genome-wide expression analysis of gene families involved in chemoreception  and csps and obps, which have recently been published  <cit> .

RESULTS
the antenna of tribolium castaneum
to determine the distribution and number of csns, we used immunohistochemistry  with a cross-reactive antibody against orco, fluorescent in situ hybridization with an orco-specific probe, and a transgenic line, ef1-b-dsred, that labels almost all and only csns in the adult antenna . moreover, we generated an orco-gal <dig> line that partially covers the orco pattern, which we refer to as the partial orco-gal <dig> line . these different approaches unequivocally confirm that csns are restricted to the distal three segments  that form the enlarged club of the antenna  <cit>  . to improve on previous data in respect to the characterization, location, and exact number of antennal sensilla  <cit> , we used in addition to the confocal laser-scanning microscopy  approaches also scanning electron microscopy  . this morphologically verified the presence of chemosensory sensilla exclusively on the three club segments  <cit> , with the highest number and diversity on the apical part of the terminal segment  <dig> .fig.  <dig> sensilla types and distribution on tribolium castaneum antennae i. a chemosensory sensilla are restricted to the distal three segments  of the t. castaneum antenna, which is composed of scape , pedicel , and flagellum, and the last labial palp  and maxillary palp  segment. clsm-stack voltex projection of a transgenic beetle head . b–b'' sem images of the club segments with close-up of segments  <dig>  and  <dig> . single sensilla: clsm maximum intensity projection overlays  of antibody-enhanced ef1-b-dsred reporter signal  and cuticle autofluorescence . c'''–h''' sem analysis. mechanoreceptive sensilla: scam are small, smooth, and dome-shaped sensilla restricted to segment  <dig> ; scha – previously described as spines  <cit>  – are longitudinally corrugated, connected to a neuron at the socket , jointed , and solid . d–d'''' spab – in t. brevicornis called sensilla squamiformium  <cit>  – resemble modified  scha  <cit>  restricted to segment  <dig> . e–e'''' mstri  have previously been described in other species  <cit> . clsm analysis showed joint-like structures at the base  of the mechanoreceptive sensilla and sem revealed a small gap at their base . chemoreceptive sensilla: f–f''' cstri are hair-like structures restricted to segment  <dig>  with a rounded tip and a smooth transition of the base; g–g'''' sbas are smooth-surfaced pegs with rounded tips and smooth transitions at the base . h–h''' scoe are short and corrugated, and their transition into the antennal cuticle shows a typical elevation . all chemoreceptive sensilla  house dendritic branches of csns labeled by dsred. the close-up in c' shows a non-csn fiber entering only the base of a scha labeled with phalloidin . chemoreceptive sensilla show a smooth transition into the antennal cuticle . whereas all mechanoreceptive sensilla are solid cuticular structures , chemoreceptive sbas appear hollow . clsm confocal laser-scanning microscopy, csn chemosensory neuron, cstri chemosensilla trichoidea, lp labial palp, mp maxillary palp, mstri mechanosensilla trichoidea, p pedicel, s scape, sbas sensilla basiconica, scam sensilla campaniformes, scha sensilla chaetica, scoe sensilla coeloconica, sem scanning electron microscopy, spab spaculate bristle

four mechanoreceptive and three chemoreceptive sensilla types could be confirmed by the combination of these techniques  and the respective number of contained csns was identified. the mechanoreceptive sensilla include the spatulate bristles , the mechanosensilla trichoidea , the sensilla campaniformes , and the sensilla chaetica , which are the most dominant sensilla type present on the lateral sites of all  <dig> segments . the chemoreceptive sensilla subdivide into chemo-sensilla trichoidea , sensilla basiconica , and sensilla coeloconica . for the chemoreceptive sensilla, segments  <dig> and  <dig> carry mostly sbas  arranged in an axial ring at the apical edge of each segment  and two scoe , whereas the terminal segment  <dig> harbors sbas , some scoe , and many cstri  . a detailed analysis of the number and distribution of the different sensilla types in males and females revealed no sexual dimorphism .

the number of csns per antenna was estimated based on the number of csns per sensillum or prong and the number of the respective sensilla per antenna. cstri contain typically one orco-immunoreactive osn . this type of sensilla is known for its pheromone receiving abilities in lepidoptera  and had been described as olfactory sensilla in d. melanogaster  <cit>  and culex quinquefasciatus  <cit> . sbas of t. castaneum consist of up to five prongs  like other tenebrionidae  <cit> . each prong harbors about six csns  – the same number as in tenebrio molitor  <cit> . of them, four or five can be considered olfactory based on orco-immunoreactivity . findings in tribolium brevicornis  <cit>  suggest an additional gustatory function of sbas, leading to the conclusion that the sbas are bimodal chemosensilla. because of this constant number of csns per prong and the shared lymphatic space , we propose that multiple pronged sbas are derived from a fusion of single sensilla. nonetheless, we refer to and count multiple pronged sbas as a single sensillum independent of the number of prongs. scoe contain three csns  without orco-immunoreactivity . the scoe in t. castaneum might therefore harbor irs as shown in d. melanogaster  <cit> . altogether, we found on each antenna about  <dig> prongs of sbas with six csns each,  <dig> cstri with one csn, and  <dig> scoe with about three csns . this leads to a total number of about  <dig> csns per antenna of t. castaneum.

anatomy of the olfactory pathway in the red flour beetle brain
antennal projections
to get an impression of the innervation pattern of chemosensory neuropils, we performed antennal and palpal backfills. backfills via the antennal nerve labeled the ipsilateral al , the antennal mechanosensory and motor center  , as well as a distinct area in the gng . while this ipsilateral restriction is common in many insects  <cit> , it is in contrast to d. melanogaster and ceratitis capitata, where the majority of osns innervate the ipsi- and contralateral sides  <cit> . the antennal backfills labeled all al glomeruli except one, which is the only glomerulus labeled by backfills of the maxillary palp via the gng . this resembles the situation in lepidoptera, where co <dig> responsive csns from the palp project into a single al glomerulus devoid of antennal innervation  <cit> . the descending antennal projections into the gng  are not labeled in the partial orco-gal4/uas-dsred line and might therefore be from gustatory or mechanosensory neurons, as described in periplaneta americana and locusta migratoria  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the central olfactory pathway of t. castaneum. a backfill of one antenna  stains all glomeruli in the ipsilateral antennal lobe  except one. this glomerulus is exclusively labeled by a backfill of a maxillary palp . b in addition to the al glomeruli, backfilling  of one antenna labeled the ipsilateral antennal mechanosensory and motor center , located n-dorsally to the al, c as well as descending fibers to the gnathal ganglion . d maximum intensity projection of the backfills of mouthparts  shows massive innervation of the gng including the gnathal olfactory center   and the primary gustatory center . e backfill of the mouthparts  revealed in the cerebral ganglion beside innervation of a single ipsilateral al glomerulus also projections in the ipsilateral lobus glomerulatus . f reporter expression of the partial orco-gal4/uas-dsred line  revealed two paired input tracts  from the maxillary  and labial palps  that converge in a medial and n-anterodorsally located glomerular area, the goc, and ascend to a microglomerularly organized area, the lg. see also additional file 7: movie s <dig>  orientation bars in  also apply for  and . al antennal lobe, ammc antennal mechanosensory and motor center, gng gnathal ganglion, goc gnathal olfactory center, l lateral, lg lobus glomerulatus, na neuroaxis-anterior, pgc primary gustatory center, tr ﻿tritocerebrum﻿

antennal lobe
for the al of freshly eclosed adults, about  <dig> distinguishable olfactory glomeruli have been previously described using a synapsin antibody  <cit> . to evaluate the glomeruli number in als of beetles, 7 days after adult eclosion, we improved the analysis by deconvolution as well as using an additional antiserum against tachykinin-related peptides , which distinctly labels also densely packed glomeruli  <cit> . this more advanced analysis resulted in the 3d reconstruction of about  <dig> glomeruli per al with no obvious sexual dimorphism .

palpal projections into accessory olfactory centers
whole mouthparts or maxillary palp backfills  revealed besides the already mentioned single al glomerulus, innervation of three distinct neuropil areas: an unpaired glomerular organized neuropil in the gng, the primary gustatory center also in the gng  <cit> , as well as an area near the al, resembling the lg of hemimetabolous insects  <cit> . the unpaired neuropil located n-anterodorsal in the gng consists of  <dig> to  <dig> glomeruli , which are all innervated from both sides of the mouthparts. this neuropil is also labeled by the partial orco-gal4/uas-dsred line , which indicates innervation by osns originating in the maxillary or labial palps  that project via two tracts into the gng. this neuropil, therefore, represents an olfactory processing center in the gng that has to our knowledge never been described before and we term the gnathal olfactory center . some of the fibers labeled by the palpal backfills, as well as the partial orco-gal4/uas-dsred line pass through the goc, ascend via the neck connectives, and terminate ipsilaterally in an area medioventral to the al , resembling the lg, which to date had only been described in hemimetabolous insects  <cit> . since the position, innervation, and glomerularly organized structure of this paired neuropil in t. castaneum is similar to the lg in cockroach, locust, and silverfish , we refer to it as lg. in summary, our data suggest that in t. castaneum, odor information from the antennae and the mouthparts are processed separately. it appears that osns from the mouthparts do not project into the al but into the goc and the lg.

projection neurons
dye injections into the al of adult t. castaneum revealed three alts formed by the pns , exclusively in the ipsilateral hemisphere. the most prominent tract, the medial antennal lobe tract , connects the al with the calyx  of the mb and the lh. the mediolateral antennal lobe tract  passes the region near the mb spur without forming sub-branches  and further projects to the lh. the lateral antennal lobe tract  projects directly to the most n-posterior part of the lh. we could not observe any obvious direct projections of the mlalt and the lalt to the ca. however, since they possibly overlap with trajectories of the malt fibers from the ca to the lh  <cit> , we cannot exclude their existence, as described for other holometabolous insects  <cit> . previously only the malt had been clearly identified in coleoptera and the existence of a mlalt had only been presumed  <cit> . our results indicate that three alts are a common feature among most holometabolous insects, including beetles.fig.  <dig> antennal lobe tracts. maximum intensity projection of a clsm image stack after dye injection into the al  revealed three antennal lobe tracts – the medial , mediolateral , and the lateral antennal lobe tract  – as well as the calyx  and the lateral horn . in the ca, most fibers from the malt form microglomeruli . the staining in the optical lobe is an artifact caused by diffusion of the dye during application. phalloidin counterstaining in green. al antennal lobe, alt antennal lobe tracts, ca calyx, clsm confocal laser-scanning microscopy, lalt lateral antennal lobe tract, lh lateral horn, malt mediolateral lobe tract, mlalt mediolateral lobe tract

the detailed architecture of the mb of t. castaneum is described in  <cit> . the ca is innervated by the malt  and microglomerularly organized as indicated by phalloidin or synapsin antibody stainings . this is similar to several insects including apis mellifera  <cit>  and d. melanogaster  <cit>  and suggests a comparable wiring with the pns. the kenyon cells  were identified in dapi  stainings based on their smaller and brighter stained nuclei  <cit> . the number of about  <dig> kcs was determined by interpolation of volumetric data as well as by counting of the stained nuclei using morphographx  <cit> . both procedures resulted in comparable numbers with the interpolation of  <dig> cas from seven animals estimating about  <dig> kcs  and the counting of nine cas from five specimen indicating approximately  <dig> kcs  per mb.

genome-wide expression analysis of genes involved in chemoreception in t. castaneum
the fully sequenced genome of t. castaneum  led to the annotation of the major gene families involved in chemoreception. based on genome data and computational gene predictions, the obps  <cit> , csps  <cit> , irs  <cit> , grs  <cit> , ors  <cit> , and snmps  <cit>  were annotated, but only for the ors was a rt-pcr-based expression analysis performed  <cit> . to validate or correct the predicted gene models of these gene family members and to determine their tissue-specific expression, we performed transcriptome analyses of adult male and female antennae, heads , mouthparts , legs, and bodies . in addition, we identified potential odes, as well as orthologs from further genes described to be involved in d. melanogaster olfaction. the detailed analysis of the obps and csps has already been published  <cit>  and revealed that the majority of the classic obps and antenna binding proteins ii  seem to be involved in chemoreception while only a few of the minus-c obps  and csps are enriched in antenna or mouthparts. the following results are based on this same set of transcriptome data . like obps and csps  <cit> , also for the genes presented here, no significant differences on the expression level between male and female antenna samples were identified . therefore, the female and male antenna samples can serve as biological replicates and indicate that reads above  <dig>  reads per kilobase per million  are reproducible . however, to minimize the rate of potential false positives in our description, we considered only genes with rpkm ≥  <dig>  as expressed. we are aware that this might lead to an underestimation of the expressed gene numbers for each class of genes. since it is impossible to determine the exact number of genes that are functionally involved in chemoreception based only on transcriptomic expression analyses, we always present two values for expressed genes, one based on rpkm ≥  <dig>  and the other defined by statistical analysis as significantly enriched over body. all raw values and the re-annotated gene models are summarized in additional file  <dig> fig.  <dig> comparison of expression levels in male and female antenna. comparison of expression levels of odorant receptors , gustatory receptors , ionotropic glutamate-like receptors , sensory neuron membrane proteins , orthologous of candidates obtained from d. melanogaster  and potential odorant degrading enzymes  in male and female antennae. average values based on two male and three female antennal samples. scatter plot of the rpkm values. dmel d. melanogaster, grs gustatory receptors, irs ionotropic glutamate-like receptors, odes odorant degrading enzymes, ors odorant receptors, rpkm reads per kilobase per million, snmps sensory neuron membrane proteins

comparing expression profiles of the irs from t. castaneum, d. melanogaster, and anopheles gambiae confirmed the antennal specific expression, as well as the high degree of phylogenetic conservation of the antennal irs  as proposed  <cit> . in contrast, the divergent irs are non-antennal specifically expressed and are highly radiated within species clades as previously shown or predicted  <cit> . t. castaneum has a lower number of irs compared to d. melanogaster and an. gambiae, due to lesser expansions of divergent irs, but maintains the basic repertoire of antennal irs . the homologs of ir25a, ir93a, and ir40a, which are necessary for humidity perception in d. melanogaster  <cit> , are significantly enriched in antennae. ir40a is exclusively expressed in antennae, which correlates with the essential role of antennae in t. castaneum hygro-perception  <cit> . the homolog of the highly sensitive salt receptor and possible co-receptor ir76b  <cit>  is significantly enriched in antennae, mouthparts, and legs, while the co-receptors ir8a and ir25a  <cit>  are highly expressed in all tissues of t. castaneum .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of irs. based on protein sequences from t. castaneum , d. melanogaster , and an. gambiae . the tree was rooted using the ir8/ir <dig> clade, according to  <cit> . robustness of the tree topology was evaluated by  <dig> rapid bootstrap replications. outer rings represent the expression in antennae and mouthparts  as log2-fold change compared to body corresponding to the scale in the left lower corner. the scale bars within the trees represent one amino acid substitution per site. antennal irs are highlighted in yellow. basically the same figure is available with absolute values instead of fold changes to get an impression of the tissue-specific abundance of the transcripts as additional file 10: figure s <dig>  ir ionotropic glutamate-like receptor

the phylogenetic comparison of the grs in t. castaneum, d. melanogaster, and an. gambiae  confirmed that only the co <dig> receptors  are highly conserved  <cit> . the other grs seem to have undergone independent radiation during the transition to t. castaneum: e.g. the sugar receptor-related branch  contains  <dig> genes  <cit> , twice the number compared to the two chosen dipterans. in addition, the single fructose receptor  found in d. melanogaster and an. gambiae is represented by eight homologs in t. castaneum. the remaining  <dig> grs belong to several t. castaneum-specific expansion groups. specific orthologs to the known bitter receptors of d. melanogaster  <cit>  as well as to the thermo-sensitive dmelgr28bd  <cit>  cannot be predicted based on our phylogenetic analysis.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of gustatory receptors . mid-point rooted tree based on protein sequences from t. castaneum , d. melanogaster , and an. gambiae . robustness of the tree topology was evaluated by  <dig> rapid bootstrap replications. outer rings represent the expression in antennae and mouthparts  as log2-fold change compared to body corresponding to the scale in the left lower corner. the scale bars within the trees represent one amino acid substitution per site. potential sugar receptors , fructose receptors , and co <dig> receptors  are labeled. known bitter receptors from d. melanogaster are highlighted in green, and the thermos-sensitive gr28bd in light blue. basically the same figure is available with absolute values instead of fold changes to get an impression of the tissue-specific abundance of the transcripts as additional file 12: figure s <dig>  gr gustatory receptor




like other insects  <cit> , t. castaneum has three co <dig> receptors , while d. melanogaster has only two that form functional heteromers  <cit> . in t. castaneum, the expression of the co <dig> receptors is not restricted to one of the chemosensory organs with tcasgr <dig> and tcasgr <dig> being significantly enriched in antennae but also being expressed together with tcasgr <dig> in the mouthparts . this dual input is in contrast to but combines both the expression of the three an. gambiae co <dig> receptors that are restricted to the maxillary palps  <cit> , as well as the two d. melanogaster co <dig> receptors that are mainly expressed in the antennae  <cit> .

the presence of grs on insect antenna had previously been postulated based on physiological response to sugars  and was identified by antennal expression analysis . our interspecies comparison  confirms the antennal enrichment of several grs in the two analyzed dipterans. however, the high number of  <dig> significantly enriched grs in the antenna of t. castaneum is unusual, but reflects the increased total number of grs in this species. interestingly, the grs of t. castaneum are present in both antenna and mouthparts at similar numbers and expression levels .

the phylogenetic comparison of or expression patterns in t. castaneum, d. melanogaster, and an. gambiae  revealed that the atypical odorant co-receptor orco  is the highest expressed or in all tissues of all three species. in t. castaneum, orco is expressed highest in antenna, followed by mouthparts. orco is the only or of t. castaneum with clear orthologs in dipterans  <cit> . the high expression levels, the distribution, and the evolutionary conservation of orco are consistent with its ancestral origin  <cit>  and its outstanding role as a chaperone and co-receptor, forming functional heteromers with all typical ors  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of odorant receptors . protein sequences  from t. castaneum , d. melanogaster , and an. gambiae . the tree was rooted using the orco clade, according to  <cit> . robustness of the tree topology was evaluated by  <dig> rapid bootstrap replications. outer rings represent the expression in antennae and mouthparts  as log2-fold change compared to body corresponding to the scale in the left upper corner. the surrounding numbers on the outer thin line indicate the expansion groups  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . tcasor <dig> and tcasor72pse were previously assigned to expansion group  <dig>  the scale bar within the tree represents one amino acid substitution per site. basically the same figure is available with absolute values instead of fold changes to get an impression of the tissue-specific abundance of the transcripts as additional file 14: figure s <dig>  or odorant receptor




the exceptional high number of typical ors  in t. castaneum is the result of large gene radiations within the coleopteran and tenebrionid lineages  <cit> , which were previously subdivided into six expansion groups   <cit> . expansion groups  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are conserved in other coleopterans  <cit>  and are mainly expressed in antennae. the ors of the expansion groups  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are highly derived, have no described homologs in other insects, and their expression is unusually often mouthpart-enriched . this is consistent with the elaborated role of the mouthparts in t. castaneum olfaction. specific orthologs to deorphanized ors of d. melanogaster  <cit>  cannot be predicted based on our phylogenetic analysis.

identification and expression of potential odorant degrading enzymes
the genome of t. castaneum contains  <dig> aldehyde dehydrogenases   with two of them being significantly enriched, but not exclusively expressed in antenna. we found four predicted genes encoding aldehyde oxidases  with one being highly enriched in antennae and mouthparts, which, in contrast to alox odes from lepidopterans , does not encode a signal peptide . five of the  <dig> identified carboxylesterases  are significantly enriched in antenna, with two of them also in the mouthparts. two other cess are significantly enriched exclusively in the mouthparts. five of these seven candidates show a predicted signal peptide for secretion . tcascesxa shares sequence similarities with d. melanogaster est <dig>  and tcasces7j with dmeljhedup, with both d. melanogaster homologs having previously been identified as ode candidates  <cit> . tcasces10c is expressed highest in antennae and related to a pheromone degrading enzyme from the japanese beetle, popillia japonica  <cit> . we identified six epoxide hydrolases , which are supposed to be membrane bound odes  <cit> , with one being significantly enriched in antennae and having a predicted signal peptide . the glutathione s-transferases  of t. castaneum had already been annotated  <cit> . the revision confirmed most gene models, only tcasgstd <dig> and tcasmgst <dig> had to be modified . eight of the  <dig> gsts are significantly enriched in antennae, with three also in the mouthparts . one of these three, tcasgstd <dig> represents a member of the gst delta subfamily such as gst-msolf <dig> from manduca sexta, which is an olfactory-specific gst expressed specifically in the sex-pheromone-detecting sensilla  <cit> . analysis of the  <dig> previously described cytochrome p450s   <cit>  revealed that two predicted gene models  were fusions of two separate genes . seven other predictions had to be adjusted based on rnaseq data . the expression analysis of these  <dig> genes showed that  <dig> are significantly enriched in the antenna, with  <dig> also in the mouthparts . in addition, six cyps are significantly enriched in mouthparts, but not in antennae. for the coleopteran phyllopertha diversa, cyps have been shown to be involved in pheromone degradation in a membrane-bound manner  <cit> .fig.  <dig> expression of t. castaneum potential odorant degrading enzymes . heat map showing the expression level of the  <dig> potential odes as a log <dig> value in different tissues . the candidates are ordered according to their protein family and chromosomal localization. horizontal brackets above indicate clustering in the genome , and the arrowheads represent the orientation of the open reading frame. underlined genes were previously found on the protein level in antennae by  <cit> . the expression levels are represented by a greyscale with the highest shown expression levels labeled black. the asterisks mark statistically significantly differentially expressed genes compared to body . the red asterisks represent up- and the blue down-regulation . a black dot in the lowest line indicates a predicted signal peptide according to a signalp  <dig>   <cit>  prediction. ode odorant degrading enzyme, rpkm reads per kilobase per million




expression of potential olfaction signal transduction pathway components
the orthologs of genes encoding signal transduction pathway components known to be involved in olfaction of d. melanogaster  <cit>  were identified by blast and manually curated. the expression analysis revealed that four of them  are significantly enriched in the antennae . however, there is no chemosensory-specific candidate exclusively expressed in antennae or mouthparts. our data, therefore, do not indicate a chemosensory-specific metabotropic signal transduction pathway.fig.  <dig> expression of t. castaneum homologs of genes described to be involved in olfaction of d. melanogaster. heat map showing the expression level of the several genes supposed to be involved in d. melanogaster olfaction, as a log <dig> value in different tissues . the expression levels are represented by a greyscale with highest shown expression levels labeled black. the asterisks mark statistically significantly differentially expressed genes compared to body . the red asterisks represent up-regulation . rpkm reads per kilobase per million




expression and distribution of sensory neuron membrane proteins
the transcriptome analysis revealed that one of the seven previously identified tcassnmps  <cit> , namely xp_ <dig>  <cit> , was incorrectly annotated and does not encode for a cd36-related protein. moreover, the gene model previously named snmp1c  was a fusion of two snmps and overlaps with snmp1d   <cit> . in our re-annotation, we removed xp_ <dig> and separated tcassnmp1c and tcassnmp1d. in addition, the gene models of tcassnmp <dig>  tcassnmp1a, and xp_ <dig>  <cit>  had to be modified based on transcriptome and race-pcr data. for xp_ <dig>  we propose the name tcassnmp <dig>  to reflect its unclear phylogenic relationship. despite the more snmp1-like expression pattern  and chromosomal localization  of tcassnmp <dig>  the comparison of the amino acid composition revealed no clear affiliation to either the snmp <dig> or the snmp <dig> subgroup  <cit> . interspecies comparison revealed no clear orthology of tcassnmp <dig> to snmps from other species, including the so-called snmp <dig> of calliphora stygia  <cit> , which, based on phylogeny, clearly represents an snmp <dig> homolog. all six tcassnmps are expressed in antennae , which was also confirmed by rapid amplification of cdna-ends pcr ﻿ based on an antennae cdna pool, but only tcassnmp1a-d and tcassnmp <dig> are significantly enriched in antennal tissue. moreover, three of the tcassnmp <dig>  as well as tcassnmp <dig>  are also enriched in mouthparts , further supporting the importance of the mouthparts for olfaction in t. castaneum. in contrast, tcassnmp <dig> is expressed highest in body and significantly underrepresented in antennae and mouthparts , which is similar to its ortholog in d. melanogaster  <cit> . despite the observation that in most insects with a fully sequenced genome only two snmps were found  <cit> , the relatively high amount of six tcassnmps of t. castaneum is not unique, since transcriptome analysis, e.g., of other beetles, revealed four snmps in dendroctonus valens  <cit>  and dastarcus helophoroides  <cit> , as well as three in ips typographus and dendroctonus ponderosae  <cit> . however, t. castaneum is currently only exceeded by the hessian fly  with seven expressed snmps  <cit> .fig.  <dig> expression of t. castaneum sensory neuron membrane proteins . heat map showing the expression level of the six sensory neuron membrane proteins of t. castaneum, as a log <dig> value in different tissues . the candidates are ordered according to their chromosomal localization . horizontal brackets above indicate clustering in the genome, and the arrowheads represent the orientation of the open reading frame. the expression levels are represented by a greyscale with highest shown expression levels labeled black. the asterisks mark statistically significantly differentially expressed genes compared to body . the red asterisks represent up- and the blue down-regulation . snmp sensory neuron membrane protein, rpkm reads per kilobase per million




discussion
independent integration centers for antennal and palpal olfactory perception
in t. castaneum, odorants are mainly perceived with the last three segments of the antenna, which carries three types of chemoreceptive sensilla , as well as with the maxillary and labial palps . accordingly, expression analysis revealed that ors are mostly expressed in antennae, but also in the mouthparts  as previously shown for several dipteran species . in contrast to the diptera, where the palps are chemosensory appendages with limited odor coding complexity, the relatively high number of orco-immunoreactive csns  as well as the high number of expressed ors, snmps, potential odes, and obps  <cit>  in t. castaneum mouthparts  imply a more prominent role of the palps in olfaction. the palpal ors are possibly involved in the evaluation of the quality of food sources, like the ors on the proboscis of manduca sexta  <cit> .fig.  <dig> 
t. castaneum head scheme depicting the major olfactory pathway components. a head section  showing the brain and the csns from the antenna  and the mouthparts . b head section  showing the gng. section orientation is indicated at the upper right corner . double-headed arrows indicate body  and neuro-axis . chemical signals are sensed by about  <dig> csns located in  <dig> sbas,  <dig> cstri, and  <dig> scoe on the last three antennal segments. these csns express  <dig> irs,  <dig> grs,  <dig> ors, and six snmps. chemosensory information is also perceived in the palps by five irs,  <dig> grs,  <dig> ors, and six smnps . the antennal nerve  projects into the ipsilateral al, where all except one  of the about  <dig> gl  are innervated. a separate antennal tract  descends into the gng , where presumably gustatory and mechanosensory information is processed. incoming olfactory information is processed by a complex network of local interneurons  in the al and further relayed by projection neurons forming three alts. the medial alt  projects to and arborizes in the calyx of the mb formed by about  <dig> kcs  to eventually innervate the lh . the mediolateral alt  and lateral alt  directly innervate the lh. from the mouthparts, csns project via the maxillary  and labial palp nerves  into the gng, where the gustatory information is processed in the pgc. the olfactory sensory input from the palps is processed in an unpaired glomerularly organized gng structure, the goc, as well as in the lg, which receives input from some palpal osns via ascending neurons  passing through the goc. some of the palp-derived chemosensory information is processed in the single al glomerulus, which lacks antennal innervation and is, therefore, exclusively innervated by projections from the mouthparts . al antennal lobe, alt antennal lobe tracts, an antennal nerve, csn chemosensory neuron, cstri chemosensilla trichoidea, gl antennal lobe glomeruli, gng gnathal ganglia, goc gnathal olfactory center, gr gustatory receptor, ir ionotropic glutamate-like receptor, kc kenyon cells, lalt lateral antennal lobe tract, lg lobus glomerulatus, lh lateral horn, lns local interneurons, malt mediolateral lobe tract, mb mushroom body, mlalt mediolateral lobe tract, or odorant receptor, osn, olfactory sensory neuron; pgc primary gustatory center, sbas sensilla basiconica, scoe sensilla coeloconica, snmp sensory neuron membrane protein




moreover, in addition to the differences on the perception level, major dissimilarities to the diptera occur on the level of odor processing. the data from the partial orco-gal <dig> line as well as the backfills from the antenna and the mouthparts indicate that processing olfactory information at least at the level of the first central relay station occurs independently of each other . this is surprising, as many of the ors expressed on the mouthparts are also expressed on the antennae. in contrast, typical or expression is mutually exclusive between antenna and palps in d. melanogaster and an. gambiae  <cit> , where in addition, projections from the palps innervate several al glomeruli  <cit> . in t. castaneum, the olfactory input stemming from the antenna seems to be processed exclusively in the al , whereas the palpal-derived olfactory information is essentially processed outside the al, in the lg  and the goc, an unpaired and glomerularly organized first olfactory center in the gng . the lg had, as far as we know, previously been described only in hemimetabolous insects . a glomerularly organized olfactory center in the gng such as the goc has, to our knowledge, not been described in any insect so far. the number of  <dig> ors  that are expressed in the mouthparts is roughly consistent with the estimated  <dig> to  <dig> glomeruli in the goc. this suggests that the wiring in the goc may resemble the situation in the als with the difference being convergence into an unpaired medial structure. the only palpal projection into the al is a mutually exclusive innervation of a single ipsilateral glomerulus , which may be involved in co <dig> perception, as described in several moth species  <cit>  and proposed for some mosquitoes  <cit> .

antennae serve also as key organs for gustatory perception
in t. castaneum, antennae and mouthparts express similar high numbers and levels of grs, which indicates the antenna as a key gustatory organ besides the mouthparts . this finding may reflect the beetles’ ground-dwelling life style and indicates that the scanning behavior with the antennae not only gathers tactile but also chemical stimuli. this is in contrast to the diptera, where the labellum is the main gustatory organ .

postulation of exceptions to the central dogma
the number of  <dig> ors that we found to be expressed in t. castaneum antennae  exceed the numbere of about  <dig> glomeruli in the al. moreover, some glomeruli are likely to get exclusive innervation by osns that express irs, as described in d. melanogaster  <cit> . these observations do not conciliate with the central dogma postulating that osns express only one typical or and all osns carrying this same or converge into one and the same glomerulus, which was hypothesized to be the typical situation for insects  <cit> . however, for d. melanogaster, both co-expression of more than one typical or per osn as well as co-convergence due to innervation of one al glomerulus by more than one osn sub-type have been already described as exceptions  <cit> . for t. castaneum, we propose that such exceptions are much more frequent.

large repertoire of potentially functional odorant receptor genes and possible environmental regulation
the genome of t. castaneum harbors  <dig> or genes  <cit> , of which  <dig> seem to encode for functional ors. of the  <dig> ors with available full sequence information  <cit> , we find in our rnaseq data  <dig> ors to be expressed in adult antennae, mouthparts, and head by a threshold of  <dig>  rpkm . in comparison to the rt-pcr-based data from  <cit> , who found  <dig> ors to be clearly expressed in adult heads, we only confirmed  <dig> ors. in addition, we identified  <dig> ors previously declared as not expressed and  <dig> ors previously not tested  <cit>  as expressed . this discrepancy may partially be due to the different type of methodology used to identify expression. however, culturing conditions and the specific genetic variations of the strain used may also be responsible for the differences.

taking both studies together, there is clear experimental evidence for  <dig> ors that are expressed in the adult head. by including adult leg and all adult body data,  <dig> ors seem to be expressed in total, of which  <dig> actually do not encode an intact or. however, for  <dig> or functional gene models, no expression could be detected so far. this may be due to low expression in a single osn or conditional expression under exceptional circumstances. the red flour beetle can live for up to two years  <cit> . during this long period in their natural environment, the beetles can encounter a variety of challenges such as food shortages, which possibly triggers flight migrations over tens of kilometers  <cit> . under such exceptional circumstances, the not or low-expressed receptor genes may become active  <cit> , as shown in studies in d. melanogaster  <cit>  and an. gambiae  <cit>  where up to fivefold upregulation of several ors was triggered by temperature or feeding state.

inter-species comparison of olfactory components
the comparison of the number of main components of the chemosensory pathway of different insect species reveals the high diversity of evolutionary strategies to enable proper chemoreception and thus, reflects the diversity of insects and the manifold adaptations to their specialized lifestyles . in particular, t. castaneum has by far the lowest number of chemoreceptive sensilla  and consequently also of csns . in contrast to this low number, the number of grs  and ors , but not of the irs  encoded in the genome is exceptionally high. the number of olfactory glomeruli in the al is within the range of most other species   <cit> . comparing the relation of or genes and number of glomeruli, the highest discrepancy occurs with about fourfold higher numbers of or genes in t. castaneum. however, also in aedes aegypti, or gene numbers are more than double the number of glomeruli  <cit> . in most other analyzed insects, except ensiferan orthopterans that have hundreds of microglomeruli  <cit> , the number of or genes is typically similar to the number of glomeruli . despite the relatively low number of irs encoded in the genome of t. castaneum, the repertoire of irs involved in olfaction is highly conserved . the number of kcs is roughly the same as in d. melanogaster and seems to be independent of the or or al glomeruli number   <cit> .table  <dig> comparison of main components of the olfactory system of different insect model organisms

no apparent sexual dimorphism
sexual dimorphism of the olfactory system is described in many insect species  <cit> . however, in contrast to other coleopterans , our analysis revealed no apparent sexual dimorphism on antenna morphology or number and distribution of sensilla . expression analysis of male and female antenna samples revealed only a small but not significant dimorphism in the obp expression levels described earlier  <cit> . also for irs, grs, ors, and snmps, we could not find any significant sexual differences , similar to the striped flea beetle phyllotreta striolata  <cit>  and in contrast to described situations in diptera and lepidoptera  <cit> . different numbers of glomeruli or different sized glomeruli were observed in several insect species  <cit>  including the beetle holotrichia diomphalia  <cit> . however, the comparison of the als of t. castaneum males and females disclosed no obvious dimorphism as previously described also for the small hive beetle   <cit> . in summary, our study did not reveal any sexual dimorphism of the olfactory system in t. castaneum. this finding is consistent with behavioral studies that showed an attraction of both sexes to the aggregation pheromone  <dig> -dimethyldecanal  <cit>  and no sex preference in the mating choice of males  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
detailed analysis of the olfactory system in t. castaneum, a holometabolous insect of special importance for the study of coleopteran and pest biology, reveals that olfactory sensory input from the antennae is processed mostly in the antennal lobes of the brain, as observed in other insect species. however, tracing of olfactory projections from the mouthparts enabled the identification of two additional neuropils: a lobus glomerulatus described previously only in a hemimetabolous insect and an unpaired glomerularly organized olfactory neuropil in the gng , which has never before been described. in addition, the high number of grs on both the antennae and mouthparts indicates that there is no organotopic separation of olfaction and gustation in this beetle. these findings are a reminder of the wide variety of solutions to chemoreception that have evolved in the holometabolous insects. this should remind us that we have much still to learn about olfactory systems in general.
