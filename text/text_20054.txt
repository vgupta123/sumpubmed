BACKGROUND
inhibitory projections are sometimes placed at decisive locations within the motor system and are therefore important for programming and controlling the execution of movement. one of these projections is the gabaergic purkinje cell  projection onto the deep cerebellar nuclei  neurons. this projection system undergoes a degeneration in the spontaneous, autosomal semidominant mouse mutation lurcher, yielding nonviable homozygous mice, while heterozygous individuals  show ataxia expressed by a tendency to fall  <cit> . the syndrome is based on a complete loss of purkinje cells during postnatal development followed by a secondary degeneration of intracerebellar and precerebellar cells  <cit> . the phenotype arises from a mutation in the orphan receptor subunit glutamate δ <dig>  <cit>  which is expressed almost exclusively in pcs and thus determines the specificity of the primary effect  <cit> . the first signs of pc degeneration are observed at postnatal day  <dig>  and by p <dig>  approximately 90% of pcs have disappeared  <cit> . the majority of dcn neurons survive, albeit deprived of their inhibitory pc input  <cit> .

behaviorally, lc/+ show deficits in standard tests of motor behavior like the rotarod and other tests of equilibrium  <cit> . however, the symptoms are mild, since differences to wild type animals were seen only in test situations that confront the motor system with higher demands such as, for instance, higher rotation frequencies in the rotarod test  <cit> . experiments using lesions of the dcn in lc/+ clearly showed that the mild symptoms reflect a residual functionality of the cerebellar system because lesioned animals showed a grossly deteriorated motor performance in comparison with non-lesioned mutants. scores measured with the rotarod test dropped virtually to zero without recovery during repeated sessions  <cit> . furthermore, spatial orientation, which is mildly impaired in lc/+  <cit> , deteriorated drastically after dcn lesions  <cit> . these behavioral data suggest that the dcn play a beneficial role for the motor performance of lc/+. electrophysiological recordings in dcn neurons of lc/+ strongly support this hypothesis. lc/+ exhibited a potentiation of gabaa-receptor-mediated average synaptic conductance  in close temporal relationship to pc death  <cit> . this potentiation of gsyn in the dcn might have an adaptive value, compensating for the loss of the extrinsic inhibition. a possible basis for the modulation of gabaergic synaptic transmission are changes in the subunit composition of gabaa receptors  <cit> . we asked in the present study whether the dcn change their gabaa receptor subunit composition in temporal relationship to the degeneration of the inhibitory afferents. guided by the occurrence of conductance changes between p <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> , we used real-time rt-pcr to investigate the gene expression of gabaa receptor subunits α1– <dig>  β1– <dig>  γ1– <dig> and δ in dcn tissue of lc/+ compared with wild type mice at these critical ages and after the completion of pc degeneration at the age of  <dig> weeks. furthermore, we addressed the question as to whether the observed changes are specific to the dcn. in addition, we performed whole cell voltage-clamp recordings of ca <dig> pyramidal neurons in mutants and controls to determine whether the potentiation in gsyn previously observed in dcn is a generalized and ubiquitous phenomenon or specific to the denervated dcn.

RESULTS
using real-time rt-pcr, mrna expression levels of gabaa receptor subunits α1– <dig>  β1– <dig>  γ1– <dig> and δ were investigated in tissue of dcn obtained from lurcher mutants aged p <dig> and p <dig> and compared to wild type controls of the respective age. since gene expression of gabaa receptor subunits  <cit>  and of internal controls such as hypoxanthine-phosphoribosyltransferase   <cit>  are known to be subject to changes during postnatal development, we restricted our comparison of gene expression to age-matched mutants and controls.

animals aged p <dig> showed no clear signs of the characteristic lc/+ phenotype in terms of an ataxic gait or tendency to fall. this time point was also before the onset of changes of gsyn  <cit> . in accordance with the lack of differences in behavior and electrophysiological recordings, at p <dig> we did not find any difference in gabaa receptor subunit gene expression between lc/+ and wild type mice either. figure  <dig> shows the ratios gabaa receptor subunit/hprt . we next investigated the gene expression in the dcn tissue of animals aged p <dig>  at p <dig>  the animals were clearly distinguishable by their mild ataxia, due to the progressive pc degeneration. at this stage, lc/+ exhibit a potentiation of gsyn in dcn  <cit> . we observed a statistically significant decrement of the γ <dig> subunit mrna expression in lc/+ . with regard to the other subunits, no differences  were found. figure  <dig> summarizes these results. the decrement of γ <dig> subunit mrna expression in lc/+ dcn tissue was of transient nature, since it could not be detected in dcn tissue of eight week old mutants  compared to age-matched controls .

such decrement of γ <dig> mrna at p <dig> was absent in lurcher hippocampus   and in coronal slices cut through the forebrain at the optic chiasm  – suggesting that the difference in gabaa receptor subunit gene expression occurred specifically in the dcn. furthermore, differences in gabaergic transmission, as found in dcn during pc degeneration  <cit> , were not observed in hippocampal slices taken from mice aged p15– <dig>  voltage-clamp recordings from hippocampal ca <dig> pyramidal neurons  revealed dense patterns of mipscs . these were gabaa-receptor-mediated events, as judged from the equilibrium potential under chloride symmetrical conditions and pharmacological interference . the equilibrium potentials were close to the expected  <dig> mv in both mutant and control neurons . the mipscs could be blocked regularly in both lc/+ and wild type mice  by application of  <dig> μm bicuculline, indicating that they were gabaergic . the average synaptic conductance values were statistically not different between the two groups . the parameters reflecting the kinetic properties of the mipscs  did not differ significantly either . an analysis of the frequencies of the mipscs revealed no differences between mutants and controls .

to rule out the possibility that different corticosterone levels at the time of animal preparation might affect our electrophysiological and/or gene expression results, serum corticosterone levels were measured in mutant and control mice aged p <dig>  to avoid variations due to sex differences, we analyzed the data obtained from male and female mice separately. we found no differences in corticosterone serum level between mutants and controls .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the residual motor functionality of lurcher mice is based on the intactness of the dcn and outlasts the period in which pcs degenerate  <cit> . to elucidate the role of candidate cellular mechanisms for this compensation, their specificity for the structure  and time of occurrence  must be investigated. mechanisms showing no clear specificity and relationship to the dcn  or to the occurrence of the pc degeneration can be excluded as a basis for this functional compensation. in a previous study from our laboratory, lurcher mice displayed a potentiation of miniature ipscs in the dcn in close temporal relationship to pc degeneration  <cit> . our present data complement these earlier results by showing that the synaptic conductance of gabaergic ipscs is unaffected in another brain structure, the hippocampus.

the responsiveness of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal system is known to be enhanced in lurcher mice. under stress, this mutant shows increased levels of serum corticosterone compared to wild type controls  <cit> . corticosterone has a known modulatory role for gabaa-receptor-mediated conductance  <cit>  as well as gabaa receptor subunit gene expression  <cit> . the absence of significant differences of serum corticosterone between lurcher and wild type mice , thus supports the idea that the changes observed in dcn of lurcher mice are not unspecific phenomena that occur throughout the brain. the results instead suggest that these changes are specific to the dcn. the down-regulation of γ <dig> mrna matches the spatiotemporal specificity of the electrophysiological changes in gabaergic transmission. this was detected in the dcn, but not in material taken from the hippocampus or from a section through the forebrain. furthermore, its de novo occurrence at p <dig> indicates a temporal relationship to the course of pc degeneration. however, since it was not detectable in adulthood , the reduction of subunit gene expression cannot be the direct structural cause of the permanent mild expression of ataxia in lurcher mice. if future work is to show a functional link between subunit composition and synaptic potentiation, the latter must be subjected to the same reasoning and must be excluded from the candidates of mechanisms directly responsible for functional adaptation in the dcn. the main question to be discussed below is therefore, to what extent can a changed subunit expression relate to changes in synaptic transmission in the lurcher mouse.

first and foremost, the differences in gene expression were calculated with reference to the ubiquitously expressed hprt. therefore, the measurements should be insensitive to known differences of volume and cell densities in lurcher dcn  <cit> . this may help to explain apparent conflicting results obtained in adult lurcher mice using in situ hybridization, where increased γ <dig> mrna levels in lurcher mice aged p <dig> based on the assessment of autoradiographic grain density were reported  <cit> . the different results may be partly explained by the different ages of animals and the different methods used, but the shrinkage of the dcn  may well have contributed to an increase in grain density . the insensitivity of the real-time rt-pcr to shrinkage of the dcn is further supported by the exclusive reduction of the γ <dig> subunit mrna expression. if general differences in cell densities, volume and presence of gabaergic synapses in dcns of lurcher and wild type mice had accounted for differences in mrna expression, the consequences should have affected all, or at least many, subunits. our findings imply that the relative composition of postsynaptic gabaa receptors during the time of pc degeneration was different in lurcher mice. this conclusion is in line with the probable postsynaptic location of the mechanism, leading to the increment in miniature synaptic conductance  <cit> . there are two possible explanations as to how the present findings may be related to changes in synaptic conductance. first, it is well established that the compositions of subunits determine single channel conductances  <cit> ; see for review  <cit> . second, subunit composition specifically affects the dynamic control of gabaa receptor expression at the cell surface and may thus effectively determine its presence at the postsynaptic membrane . our study shows that the content of α <dig> and β <dig> mrna remained unchanged in lurcher mice compared to the age-matched controls. none of these facts suggest that the amount of generated gabaa receptors and their subsequent transport to the cell membrane is impaired in lurcher mice. on the other hand, it may also be possible to regulate receptor presence by interfering with the removal of receptors from the membrane. gabaa receptors undergo a constitutive endocytosis after association with the adaptin ap <dig> complex, a process dependent on the presence of β and γ subunits  <cit> . moreover, blockade of endocytosis enhances the amplitude of gabaa-mediated mipscs in hippocampal neurons  <cit> . more specifically, connolly et al.  <cit>  ascertained that cell surface stability of gabaa receptors depends on the presence of γ <dig> subunits. they observed that receptors containing γ <dig> are selectively removed from the cell surface upon activation of protein kinase c with concomitant reduction of gaba-induced currents. in summary, a tentative hypothesis – to be tested by further experiments – can be formulated from these considerations as follows: the specific γ <dig> reduction of subunit expression during pc degeneration in lurcher mice might modulate endocytosis such as to allow the lurcher dcn neurons to specifically increase the gabaa receptor cell surface levels at the postsynaptic membrane. this speculation receives some experimental support from the results of a non-stationary fluctuation analysis on mipscs in wild type and lurcher mice. this analysis gave no indication of changes of single channel conductances, while the peak number of open receptors underlying lurcher mipscs was estimated to be of a factor two higher than in wild type mice  <cit> .
