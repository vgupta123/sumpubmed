BACKGROUND

l-glutamate, the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the nervous system is involved in a wide variety of brain functions and plays a key role in the pathogenesis of many neurological disorders. it is a potent neurotoxin capable of neuronal destruction when present in high concentration. glutamate-evoked excitotoxicity has been implicated in the etiology of many neurodegenerative diseases including alzheimer’s disease , parkinson’s disease , and ischemic stroke  <cit> . glutamate-induced cell death is mediated in part by overstimulation of the postsynaptic glutamate receptor system  <cit>  and non-receptor mediated oxidative toxicity  <cit> . prolonged exposure to high concentrations of extracellular glutamate promotes oxidative toxicity by activation of mechanisms that negatively impact cysteine uptake into cells via the cystine/glutamate antiporter leading to depletion of glutathione   <cit> . depletion of gsh causes a downregulation of the cystine-dependent antioxidant system leading to excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species  accompanied by oxidative stress. oxidative stress perturbs mechanisms that regulate ca2 + homeostasis in the mitochondria and activates pathways that lead to collapse of the mitochondrial membrane polarity and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore .

mitochondria are autonomous double membrane-enclosed organelles present in most mammalian cells, and mainly involved in aerobic respiration. they are dynamic organelles that continuously undergo remodeling by fusion and fission in response to the cellular and environmental cues. mitochondrial fusion and fission play critical roles in the maintenance of mitochondrial function and regulation of bioenergetic state of the cell. three dynamin-related gtpases, mitofusins  <dig> , mitofusin  <dig>  and optic atrophy  <dig>  are required for fusion of the mitochondrial outer and inner membranes in mammalian cells ; while mitochondrial fission is mediated by the dynamin-like protein- <dig>  and the mitochondrial fission  <dig> protein   <cit> . mitochondrial fusion results in enlargement of the mitochondria through merging of two separate units. in addition, mitochondrial fusion presumably regulates electron transport, mitochondrial metabolism and calcium homeostasis  <cit> . in contrast, mitochondrial fission is essential to establish new mitochondria and to eliminate defective mitochondria by mitochondrial autophagy  <cit> . both processes are tightly controlled and uniformly balanced under physiological conditions.

autophagy is a vital intracellular catabolic process that causes cellular protein and organelle turnover, through sequestering and priming proteins for lysosomal degradation  <cit> . autophagy can be stimulated by a variety of stress-inducing conditions including nutrient depletion, reactive oxygen species, and hypoxia  <cit> . activation of this pathway may not necessarily lead to cell death  <cit> . defects in the autophagy-regulation and signaling have been associated with many human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders  <cit> . three types of autophagy  have been identified of which, microautophagy has been studies extensively  <cit> . a number of key signaling pathways ties autophagy to stress responses. activation of these pathways is orchestrated by a sequence of core autophagy-related  genes that are evolutionarily conserved. one of the proteins critical to this process is beclin- <dig>  the mammalian orthologue of the yeast autophagy protein atg <dig>  beclin- <dig> induces autophagy by interacting with several cofactors and vps- <dig>  a class iii phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate kinase , to form a complex that promotes autophagosome formation in the early stages of autophagy  <cit> . unlike beclin- <dig>  another member of the atg protein family, microtubule-associated protein  <dig> light chain  <dig>  localize to different autophagic membranes and is essential for final autophagosome formation. lc <dig>  synthesized as a pro-protein is rapidly converted to lc3-i by atg <dig> and further transformed by a series of conjugating and activating atg proteins to lc3-ii, the autophagosomal membrane bound form considered as a marker of autophagy activation.

selenium is central component at the catalytic sites of various selenium-dependent enzymes including glutathione peroxidase . selenium has been demonstrated to reduce ros production  <cit> , protect cells against glutamate toxicity  <cit> , oxidative stress  <cit>  and inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . animal experiments have showed that selenium supplementation reduces ros production, ameliorates cisplatin induced neurotoxicity and ischemia-induced brain damage  <cit> . however, the mechanisms by which selenium exerts its protective effect against glutamate insult in neuronal cells remains ambiguous. in this study, glutamate exposed ht <dig> cells were used as an in vitro model to examine signaling pathway through which, sodium selenite could potentially moderate glutamate-induced toxicity in neuronal cells. cellular viability, ultrastructural changes, ros production, and biomarkers for autophagy and mitochondrial fission were measured respectively. our results showed that sodium selenite blocked glutamate provoked neuronal death by restoring mitochondrial function, reducing ros production, inhibiting caspase activation, and impairment in autophagy.

RESULTS
glutamate decreased and selenite increased cell viability
the cell viabilities in vehicle and various concentrations of glutamate treated cells were assessed using mtt assay kit after 24 h of incubation . the results showed that incubation with 2 mm of glutamate reduced the cell viability from  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in control to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % , while 4 mm of glutamate reduced it to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . the cell viability was further decreased with the increased concentrations of glutamate. therefore, the cell viabilities were  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at 6 mm,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at 8 mm, and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at 10 mm of glutamate concentrations . in next experiments, we incubated the cell with 6 mm glutamate and 100 nm of sodium selenite concurrently and measured cell viability after  <dig>   <dig> and 24 h . the results showed that the cell viabilities were not significantly altered in selenite, glutamate and glutamate plus selenite groups compared with vehicle control after 6 h of incubation. the cell viabilities were significantly decreased after 10 h of glutamate incubation to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % comparing to control of 100 ±  <dig> % . the viability was further decreased to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % after 24 h of glutamate incubation compared with control . compared with glutamate incubation alone, the ht <dig> cells co-treated with glutamate and selenite had a mild improved cell viability after 10 h . however, the viability was significantly improved by selenite co-treatment at 24 h comparing to glutamate alone .fig.  <dig> cell viabilities in three experimental groups assessed by mtt assay. a cell viability assays were performed at 24 h of incubation with various concentrations of glutamate. the viabilities of the cells were reduced to  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % with the glutamate at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 10 mm concentrations. n =  <dig> in each group. **p <  <dig>  versus control by student’s t test. b cell viability after  <dig>   <dig> and 24 h of glutamate  incubation with or without concurrent addition of selenium . after 10 h of incubation, cell viabilities were reduced to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % by glutamate and the reduction was moderately improved by selenite . f =  <dig>  and p <  <dig>  by anova. after 24 h of culture, glutamate further reduced the cell viability to  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, while selenite rescued the viability to  <dig>  ±  <dig> %. f =  <dig> . *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig>  versus control and ##

selenium decreased glutamate-induced superoxide production
superoxide productions were measured by dhe fluorescent probe following glutamate and/or selenite incubation. as shown in fig.  <dig>  faint dhe immunofluorescence was detected in normal ht <dig> control cells, representing the basal amount of superoxide  produced during normal cellular metabolic activity. glutamate exposure resulted in a surge of dhe signal , suggesting significantly increased superoxide production . treatment with selenium in glutamate-incubated cells reduced the dhe fluorescent intensity to  <dig>  ±  <dig> , a 42% reduction comparing to that of non-selenite treated, glutamate exposed cultures .fig.  <dig> superoxide accumulation measured by dihydroethidium  fluorescence. accumulation of superoxide in the cells was measures by incubation in dhe  after 24 h following glutamate and/or selenium treatments. cells were counterstained with dapi to label the nuclei . relative immunointensity increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in control to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  after glutamate exposure. concurrent treatment of the cells with glutamate and selenite reduce the dhe immunointensity to  <dig>  ±  <dig> . f =  <dig> . **p <  <dig>  versus control and ##

glutamate activated and selenium suppressed mitochondria-initiated cell death pathway
since apaf- <dig>  caspase- <dig>  and caspase- <dig> play key roles in mediating mitochondria-initiated cell death pathway, we performed immunocytochemistry using antibodies against apaf- <dig>  cleaved caspase- <dig>  and cleaved caspase- <dig>  the results were further verified with western blots using antibodies against apaf- <dig>  total and cleaved caspase- <dig>  and total and cleaved caspase- <dig>  the results showed that there were very few faintly stained apaf- <dig> positive neurons in the normal control cells. glutamate exposure for 24 h significantly increased the immunoreactivity of apaf- <dig> in the cytoplasm as shown in fig.  <dig>  concurrent treatment with selenite reduced the immunoreactivity of apaf- <dig> in glutamate-exposed neurons. western blot using cytosolic fraction further support the findings showing that apaf- <dig> protein band intensity in the cytosolic fraction were significantly increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in control to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in glutamate treated cells . selenite treatment significantly reduced the apaf- <dig> protein band intensity to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  .fig.  <dig> immunocytochemistry and protein blotting of apaf- <dig>  apaf- <dig>  was detected using antibody after 24 h of glutamate or glutamate plus selenite treatments. dapi  was used to label the nuclei. western blot was performed using cytosolic fraction. relative band intensity was measured and presented in the bar graph. Β-tubulin served as internal protein loading control. glutamate incubation increased the apaf- <dig> protein band intensity to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and concurrent treatment with selenite reduced the value to  <dig>  ±  <dig> . f =  <dig> . *p <  <dig>  and **p <  <dig>  versus control; #

similarly, there were very few faintly stained caspase- <dig> positive cells in control cultures. after glutamate treatment for 24 h, the number of caspase- <dig> positively stained neurons increased and concurrent treated of selenium decreased immunointensity of caspase- <dig> . the results were further confirmed by western blot. consistently, glutamate caused significant elevation of cleaved caspase- <dig>  compared to control . treatment with selenite significantly ablated the glutamate-induced increase .fig.  <dig> immunocytochemistry and protein blotting of caspase- <dig>  immunocytochemistry was performed 24 h after treatments using antibody against cleaved caspase- <dig>  and counterstained with dapi . western blots were performed using antibodies against total and cleaved caspase- <dig> in the cytosolic fraction. beta-tubulin served as an internal control. relative band intensities were measured and presented in the bar graph. cleaved caspase- <dig> protein band intensity increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in control to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  after glutamate incubation and reduced to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  by selenite treatment. f =  <dig> . *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig>  versus control; #
p <  <dig>  versus glutamate by anova with post hoc tukey’s test. n =  <dig> in each group




there was faint punctuated caspase- <dig> positive staining localized in the cytoplasm of non-glutamate-incubated control cells. after glutamate incubation for 24 h, caspase- <dig> immunoreactivity significantly enhanced in the cytosol and nuclear translocation was noted. concurrent treatment with selenite prevented caspase- <dig> nuclear translocation but did not seem to reduce the immunoreactivity in the cytosol and prevented caspase- <dig> nuclear translocation . western blot using nuclear fraction revealed that cleaved caspase- <dig> increased significantly in glutamate-incubated cells  compared with control . such increases were ameliorated by selenite treatment .fig.  <dig> immunocytochemistry and protein blotting of caspase- <dig>  immunocytochemistry was performed 24 h after treatments using antibody against cleaved caspase- <dig>  and counterstained with dapi . western blots were performed using antibodies against cleaved caspase- <dig> in the nuclear fraction. beta-tubulin served as an internal control. relative band intensities were measured and presented in the bar graph. cleaved caspase- <dig> protein band intensity increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in control to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  after glutamate incubation and concurrent treatment of selenite reduced it to  <dig>  ±  <dig> . f =  <dig> . *p <  <dig>  and **p <  <dig>  versus control; #

selenium reduces glutamate-induced mitochondrial fission
mitochondrial fission markers fis <dig>  drp <dig>  and p-drp <dig> were detected in the mitochondrial fraction of the cell lysate using western blotting. as shown in fig.  <dig>  protein band intensity of fis <dig> increased significantly in glutamate treated cells  comparing to control cells . concurrent treatment of glutamate incubated cells with selenite significantly reduced the level of fis <dig> to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . similarly, glutamate increased the p-drp <dig> protein relative band intensity from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in control to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in glutamate incubated cells. treatment with selenite reduced the p-drp <dig> intensity to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . this is further supported by the following imaging study.fig.  <dig> western blotting of mitochondrial fission proteins. fission proteins fis- <dig>  total drp- <dig> and phospho-drp <dig>  were semi-quantified in the mitochondrial fractions using specific antibodies. cox iv served as an internal control. band relative densities were measured and presented in the bar graphs. fis- <dig> protein band intensity increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in control to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  after glutamate incubation and reduced back to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  by selenite. f =  <dig> . *p <  <dig>  and **p <  <dig>  versus control; #

p <  <dig>  and ##
p <  <dig>  versus glutamate by anova with post hoc tukey’s test. n =  <dig> in each group




selenium suppressed glutamate-activated autophagy
the last step of autophagy is the fusion of autophagosome with lysosome. therefore, colocalization of mitochondrial marker mitotracker green and lysosomal marker lysotracker red could be used as an indication of mitochondrial autophagy. as shown in fig.  <dig>  in control cells, punctate green staining was observed, representing normal mitochondria detected by the probe. there were almost no lysosomes were detected. after glutamate treatment for 24 h, both mitotracker green and lysotracker red staining increased significantly in the cytosol, suggesting increased numbers of mitochondria and lysosomes. treatment with selenite reduced the intensity of lysotracker labeling.fig.  <dig> co-localization of mitotracker green and lysotracker red. the cells were incubated for 30 min with mitotracker green  and lysotracker red  to visualize the colocalization of mitochondria and lysosomes. colocalization of the two dyes turns the color into orange. western blot detected lc3-i and ii in the mitochondrial fraction. relative lc3-ii band intensities were measured and presented in the bar graph. lc3-ii protein band intensity increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in control to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in glutamate and reduced to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in selenite treated groups. f =  <dig> . *p <  <dig>  and **p <  <dig>  versus control; ##
p <  <dig>  versus glutamate by anova with post hoc tukey’s test. n =  <dig> in each group




another marker of autophagy is the conversion of lc3-i to lc3-ii. lc- <dig> levels were measure in the cytosolic fraction of the cells. it was shown that the levels of lc3-ii band intensities significantly increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in control to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in glutamate treated cells  and selenite reverted the glutamate-induced elevation back to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  .

discussion
neuronal cell injury and death are major pathological features of many cns disorders such as alzheimer’s disease, parkinson’s disease, huntington’s disease, and stroke. these disorders provoke alterations in cell function and survival in distinct regions of the brain. for example, stroke triggers a significant neuronal death and several theories, including excitotoxicity, production of oxygen free radicals, nitric oxide level, and mitochondrial injury have been proposed to explain the cause of damage to neurons during stroke  <cit> . ischemic stroke occurs as a result of focal cerebral ischemia associated with permanent brain infarction. ischemic stroke often leads to excessive glutamate release, acute excitotoxicity and nerve cell damage. in this study, ht <dig> cells exposed to glutamate was used as in vitro model of stroke to explore the effects of selenium on glutamate excitotoxicity and to assess the underlying mechanisms that lead to attenuation of glutamate-induced toxicity in the cell. our findings showed that selenium could attenuate cell apoptosis, diminish superoxide production, and decrease expression of apaf- <dig>  caspase  <dig>  and caspase  <dig>  in addition, selenium decreased the level of the lc-3ii, a proxy for autophagosome and protected against mitochondrial impairment induced by glutamate. our results further indicate that glutamate-induced cell death appears to be a results caused by a mechanism that involves structural changes typical of apoptosis, including swelling of the mitochondria, chromatin condensation, and appearance of lysosomes.

selenium has traditionally been used as a supplement for several decades in the prevention and treatment of human diseases including keshan cardiomyopathy  <cit> , kashin-beck osteoarthropathy  <cit> , osteopenia  <cit>  and certain forms of cancers , and has been shown to modulate the functions of a variety of intracellular proteins . recent research has focused on the neuroprotective potential of selenium as a candidate for therapeutic intervention in hypoxic injuries and ischemia-induced neuronal damage . the neuroprotective effect of selenium may be dependent on its antioxidant properties. selenium in the form of selenoprotein is present in the active site of glutathione peroxidase and regulates the activity of the enzyme. glutathione peroxidase participates in the complex antioxidant defense signaling network that is essential for the detoxification of cellular stresses induced by free radicals. ros are chemically reactive molecules that contain oxygen such as superoxide, singlet oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide . they are produced as natural byproducts of normal metabolism and play beneficial roles in cell signaling  <cit> . however, excessive ros can be detrimental to cells as a result of induction of oxidative stress and cellular damage  <cit> . earlier studies describing the chronic effect of glutamate exposure in cellular toxicity point to the crucial role of oxidative stress-induced ros as a major stimulus of glutamate-induced cell death . it has been reported that excessive concentrations of extracellular glutamate antagonize the glutamate/cystine-antiporter and inhibit cystine uptake. this inhibitory effect leads to accumulation of ros, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial hyperactivation  <cit> . previous studies have shown that selenium attenuates the level of ros following various in vitro injury models . our results are in agreement with these studies. we observed high production of cellular superoxide radical with glutamate treatment that was considerably reduced upon co-treatment with selenium. this suggest that selenium exerts its influence partly by enhancing the activity of antioxidant systems in cells under stress.

apoptosis, also known as programmed cell death, is a tightly regulated cell suicide process necessary for growth, development, and aging in multicellular organisms. two well defined apoptotic pathways, intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, have been identified. both pathways can be are activated by a variety of physiological and pathological conditions or stimuli and converge on a common execution point driven by caspases. caspases are a family of cysteine-aspartic proteases endoproteases. caspases are generally divided into two subtypes, initiator and effector caspases. initiator caspases  contain large prodomains and act as regulators of the caspase proteolytic cascade. effector caspases  are activated by initiator caspases, through proteolytic cleavage, and function in disassembly of cells into apoptotic bodies  <cit> . glutamate induces cell death through processes that involve both necrosis and apoptosis  <cit>  although, apoptosis appears to be the major driver of cell fate at late time points. apoptotic process culminate in alterations in the integrity of the inner mitochondrial membrane that results in the formation of the mptp  <cit> , failure of the mitochondrial membrane potential and release of pro-apoptogenic proteins into the cytosol. among the proteins released from the mitochondria is cytochrome c , a major component of the electron transport chain. cyt c binds and activates apaf- <dig>  recruits procaspase- <dig> and datp, and thus facilitates assembly of the apoptosome. formation of the multi-protein apoptosome complex results in the activation of effector caspases  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which in turn translocates to the nucleus, and initiates cleavage of dna and subsequent degradation of nucleosomal proteins  <cit> . our findings show that the magnitude of apaf- <dig>  increased significantly in ht- <dig> cells under glutamate tension, while selenium antagonized the glutamate-induced increase in apaf- <dig>  furthermore, glutamate-dependent increase in apaf- <dig> was accompanied by concomitant increases in cleaved caspase  <dig> and cleaved caspase  <dig>  our data indicate that selenium also reduced the stimulation of caspase  <dig> and caspase-3-like protease activity that occurs in glutamate exposed cells. these selenium-dependent influences on effector caspase have been demonstrated previously in other cellular and in vivo animal models  <cit> . apaf- <dig> is one of the well-studied physiological regulator of events of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in most death pathways. typically, it exists in an auto-inhibited form in the cytosol until it binds to cyt c and promotes assembly of the apoptosome  <cit> . our present findings suggest that inhibition of apaf- <dig> activity may play a central role as a potential mechanism by which selenium protects ht <dig> cells from glutamate excitotoxicity.

the structure of mitochondria is mainly regulated by cycles of fusion and fission. during apoptosis, mitochondria undergo fission, chromatin condensation, and becomes highly fragmented  <cit> . the mammalian drp <dig> is a dynamin-related cytoplasmic gtpase that mediates mitochondrial fission. drp <dig> is a highly regulated protein and undergoes a number of steps including translocation from cytoplasm to the mitochondrial outer membrane for fission to occur  <cit> . our results showed that p-drp <dig>  as well as fis- <dig>  increased significantly after glutamate exposure, suggesting that glutamate triggered mitochondrial fission. selenium treatment hampered the increases of p-drp <dig> and fis- <dig>  indicating its ability of preventing mitochondrial fission. it is widely accepted that fragmentation associated with mitochondrial fission is a key activator of mitochondrial autophagy. during autophagy, components of damaged mitochondria are encapsulated in autophagosomes. progression of autophagy is dependent on the recruitment of lc3-ii, a c-terminal lipidated form of cytosolic lc3-i as a structural component of the autophagosomal membrane. thereafter, lc3-ii tagged autophagosomes are delivered to the lysosome/vacuole for degradation by lysosomal hydrolases. our results revealed that glutamate increased the presence of lysosome in the cytoplasm and colocalization with the mitochondrial marker, supporting the prediction that glutamate induces mitochondrial autophagy. the presence of autophagy was supported by quantifying the relationship between lc3-i and lc3-ii. glutamate exposure led to an increase in autophagy as reflected in the conversion of lc3-i to lc3-ii using western blotting. selenium on the other hand, significantly reduced the intensity of lysotracker labeling and blocked the alteration of lc3-i to lc3-ii, and thus, protected against glutamate-dependent cell death. increased levels of beclin  <dig> and upregulation of lc3-ii relative to lc3-i as markers of autophagy in cells exposed to glutamate have been reported in our earlier studies  <cit> . although the mechanisms by which selenium altered the ratios of lc3-i and lc3-ii in the presence of glutamate is uncertain, we posit that selenium could modulate this process potentially by blocking the upstream conjugation of phosphatidylethanolamine to lc3-i, or enable interconversion of lc3-ii back to lc3-i. the actual mechanism remains to be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that glutamate exposure causes increase of superoxide radical, activation of mitochondria-initiated cell death pathway, tilting mitochondrial dynamic balance towards fission and triggers mitochondrial autophagy. concurrent treatment with sodium selenite rescues glutamate-induced cell death by reducing superoxide production, inhibiting intrinsic cell death pathway, blocking mitochondrial fission and suppressing mitochondrial autophagy. it is concluded that the protective effects of selenium against glutamate cytotoxicity is associated with preserving mitochondrial integrity and dynamic balance.
