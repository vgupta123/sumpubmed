BACKGROUND
synapses facilitate efficient neuronal communication by bringing close together the organelles and molecules involved in the release and detection of neurotransmitters. thus, to understand how synapses function, it is necessary to elucidate the signaling pathways that regulate the development of cellular specializations unique to synapses. for this purpose, one particular synaptic specialization – found at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction  – has been examined extensively over the past several decades. enriched in the postsynaptic domain of the nmj are ion channels named acetylcholine  receptors  that open upon binding to the neurotransmitter ach; opening of achrs depolarizes the synaptic region of muscle to trigger contraction. the synaptic aggregation of achrs during nmj assembly is therefore a process of paramount importance, one that is recognized to be tightly controlled by the combined actions of both muscle- and nerve-derived factors.

achr clustering in muscle is initiated by the activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase musk  and it is mediated by the cytoplasmic protein rapsyn that binds to achrs and tethers them to the cytoskeleton  <cit> . during development, rudimentary achr clusters first appear before innervation in a musk-dependent manner and bestride the midline of embryonic muscle fibers  <cit> ; these clusters are referred to as "pre-patterned" clusters because they form in the absence of neural influence. later, in innervated muscle, achrs become concentrated at incipient synapses where musk is locally stimulated by the nerve-derived factor agrin  <cit> . this synaptic accumulation of achrs is furthermore coupled with the disassembly of the pre-patterned achr clusters  <cit> , and these two distinct processes together help generate a 1000-fold higher density of achrs at the nmj compared to extra-synaptic muscle  <cit> .

the disassembly of pre-patterned achr clusters, which is our focus here, was first shown to occur independently of achr activity  <cit> ; however, it was also reported that in rat and chick myotubes achr agonists trigger the loss of achr clusters  <cit> , an issue that has recently attracted renewed attention. it has been observed that pre-patterned achr aggregates, which are eliminated by embryonic day  <dig> or  <dig>  in innervated muscle fibers of normal mice, are retained in the muscles of mutant mice with defective motor innervation  <cit>  and of mice lacking the gene encoding the ach biosynthetic enzyme choline acetyltransferase   <cit> . these findings have engendered the view that ach directs the disassembly of achr aggregates, and it has been proposed that neural agrin protects synaptic achrs against ach-induced dispersal  <cit> . the dispersal of achr clusters by ach is further thought to involve the ser/thr kinase cdk <dig>  <cit>  whose activity, in turn, appears to depend on the regulation of the protease calpain by rapsyn  <cit> .

achr activity-independent achr dispersal has been well documented in frog and fish muscle where synaptogenic stimuli trigger both the assembly and disassembly of achr aggregates  <cit> . in our studies we have used embryonic xenopus muscle cultures to focus on the regulation of the achr dispersal process by tyrosine phosphatases  <cit>  because it is known that tyrosine phosphorylation stabilizes achr clusters by strengthening links between achrs and the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . we showed that tyrosine phosphatases mediate the dispersal of pre-patterned achr clusters by synaptogenic stimuli and that tyrosine dephosphorylation of pre-patterned clusters precedes the loss of achrs from these sites in situ  <cit> . to date, however, the specific phosphatases involved in dispersing achr clusters and the signaling pathways that stimulate them have remained unknown. these issues were addressed here using pharmacological and molecular methods and we describe for the first time a role of the tyrosine phosphatase shp <dig>  and its activator signal regulatory protein α <dig> , in the disassembly of pre-patterned achr clusters.

recombinant heparan-binding growth associated molecule  was generously provided by dr. heikki rauvala . neural agrin was obtained as described  <cit> . the following reagents were purchased: nsc- <dig> ; tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin  ; anti-phosphotyrosine  and anti-step tyrosine phosphatase monoclonal antibodies ; anti-shp <dig> monoclonal antibody and protein tyrosine phosphatase antibody kit ; secondary antibodies conjugated to fitc  and horseradish-peroxidase  ; triton x- <dig>  .

whole-mount in situ hybridization
xenopus embryos collected at different developmental stages were fixed in memfa solution  for  <dig> h at room temperature and then stored in absolute methanol at -20°c. embryos were re-hydrated through a graded methanol series before carrying out in situ hybridization as described  <cit> . the cdna encoding xenopus sh <dig> domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase shp <dig> in pcs2+ vector was kindly provided by dr. benjamin neel . this was used to synthesize digoxigenin-labeled crna probes in the antisense and sense directions with sp <dig> and t <dig> rna polymerases with the riboprobe in vitro transcription kit . hybridization reactions were carried out in parallel with these probes at a concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml  overnight at ~60°c. embryos were washed extensively with several buffers, including those containing rnasea  and rnase t <dig> , and then stained overnight at 4°c with alkaline phosphatase-linked anti-digoxigenin antibody. chromogenic reaction was carried out by using nbt/bcip as substrate in the alkaline phosphatase buffer . embryos were made transparent with a 2: <dig> mixture of benzyl benxoate:benzyl alcohol and imaged using a color ccd camera.

protein extract preparation and immuno-blotting
c <dig> mouse myoblasts  were differentiated into myotubes  and proteins were extracted from them using a tx- <dig> buffer  as described  <cit> . to extract xenopus embryonic muscle proteins, dissected tadpole tails were homogenized in the above triton buffer and the homogenates were incubated for  <dig> min on ice  before centrifuging them to obtain clarified extracts. proteins were resolved by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to pvdf membranes, which were blocked in tris-buffered saline containing  <dig> % tween- <dig> and 5% milk and immuno-blotted with antibodies diluted in the same blocking buffer. primary antibodies were detected using appropriate hrp-linked secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence substrate .

shp <dig> and sirpα <dig> cdna constructs and mrna synthesis
human wild-type and mutant shp <dig> cdna constructs were from dr. benjamin neel . the mutant shp2s were shp <dig> e76a, which has a point mutation in the n-sh <dig> domain and produces a constitutively active shp <dig>  <cit> , and shp <dig> deltap, which has a deletion in the catalytic domain and, lacking both catalytic activity and substrate-binding ability, acts as a dominant-negative mutant  <cit> . wild-type shp <dig> , shp <dig> e76a and shp <dig> deltap cdnas were cloned into psp64r <dig> vector  <cit> . human full-length sirpα <dig>  and truncated sirpα <dig>  constructs were from dr. david clemmons . in sirp-tr, the y <dig> site of the tandem phosphorylation domain of sirpα <dig> that binds to shp <dig> is eliminated, generating a sirpα <dig> mutant that does not activate shp <dig> and functions as a dominant-negative suppressor of shp <dig> signaling  <cit> . sirpα <dig> sequences were in pcdna <dig>  vector  <cit>  as were those encoding the reporter green fluorescent protein . shp <dig> mrnas were prepared with the sp <dig> in vitro transcription kit purchased from ambion  and the sirpα <dig> and gfp mrnas were prepared with the t <dig> ultra kit from the same company. shp <dig> and sirpα <dig> mrnas were mixed with gfp mrna before microinjection.

xenopus embryo microinjection and preparation of primary muscle cultures
mixtures of shp <dig> or sirpα <dig> and gfp mrnas  were injected into one cell of 2– <dig> cell stage xenopus embryos with a drummond nanoject oocyte injector . injected embryos were maintained in holfreter's solution containing 4% ficoll and those expressing exogenous mrnas were identified by green fluorescence and used for preparing muscle cultures  <cit> . myotomal muscle cells were cultured from stage 20– <dig> embryos as described  <cit>  and plated on glass coverslips coated with ecl  substrate . achr redistribution experiments used muscle cells maintained in culture for 2– <dig> days.

shp2-inhibitor, r-btx/antibody labeling and microscopy
the shp2-inhibitor nsc- <dig>  <cit>  was dissolved in water and then diluted into culture medium as required. r-btx-labeled muscle cells were incubated in culture medium without or with nsc- <dig>  in the absence or presence of agrin or hb-gam beads. polystyrene beads  were coated with hb-gam as described  <cit> . in cases where muscle cells expressed exogenous mrnas, live cultures were used to examine cells of comparable gfp fluorescence intensity and achr cluster redistribution data were collected from a minimum of five separate mrna injections and culture preparations. in experiments using wild-type cultures, muscle cells were fixed with cold 95% ethanol and stained with primary and fluorescent secondary antibodies. labeled cells were imaged using an olympus ix <dig> microscope equipped with a hamamatsu orcaii cooled-ccd or orca-er camera controlled by metamorph software .

RESULTS
shp <dig> expression in xenopus embryonic muscle
we previously reported that shp <dig>  a tyrosine phosphatase with two sh <dig> domains  <cit> , modulates achr clustering in c <dig> mouse myotubes by suppressing agrin/musk signaling  <cit> , but whether or not shp <dig>  participates in the dispersal of pre-patterned achr clusters by synaptogenic stimuli could not be tested. this is because in the c <dig> myotube cultures very few pre-patterned achr clusters developed and those that did form resembled new clusters induced by agrin. thus, to investigate tyrosine phosphatase involvement specifically in the disassembly of achr clusters, here we used primary cultures of embryonic xenopus muscle cells in which the dispersal of pre-patterned achr clusters by synaptogenic stimuli can be examined separately from the induction of new achr clusters and both processes can be quantified   <cit> . we began by staining the myotomal muscle cell cultures with antibodies against twelve different tyrosine phosphatases and found that an anti-shp <dig> antibody, unlike other antibodies tested, labeled the cells strongly and uniformly , which led us to determine if shp <dig> was present in embryonic xenopus muscle in vivo. whole mount in situ hybridization was carried out with an antisense digoxigenin-labeled rna probe made from xenopus shp <dig> cdna, and the results showed that shp <dig> mrna was enriched in the brains and myotomes of embryos at stages  <dig> and  <dig> . the detection of shp <dig> mrna was specific as no hybridization occurred with a control sense probe . moreover, in immuno-blotting assays using tadpole tail extracts, an anti-shp <dig> monoclonal antibody stained a single protein band of the size expected for shp <dig> , and the antibody also stained a band of similar size in c <dig> mouse myotube extracts . these results combined with previous demonstrations of shp <dig> expression in rodent muscle cells  <cit>  identified shp <dig> as a candidate tyrosine phosphatase involved in the dispersal of pre-patterned achr clusters.

shp <dig> inhibition and achr cluster dispersal
to test whether shp <dig> activity influences the dispersal of pre-patterned achr clusters during nmj formation, we exposed cultured xenopus muscle cells to nsc- <dig>  a recently identified chemical inhibitor of shp <dig>  <cit> . cells were stained with rhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin  to label achrs and incubated overnight without or with the drug. first, in the absence of synaptogenic stimulation, small achr clusters  developed in many of the nsc-treated but not control cells ; normal, pre-patterned clusters  were detected in both nsc-treated and control cells. when used at  <dig> μm, nsc- <dig> nearly doubled the percentage of muscle cells with achr micro-clusters , and at higher concentrations of nsc  there appeared to be a further increase  in achr clustering . in the  <dig> – <dig> μm range, nsc- <dig> is likely to inhibit  shp <dig>  and to a lesser extent ptp1b , but at high concentrations other phosphatases could be affected  <cit> . as no significant staining of xenopus muscle cells was detected using either the anti-shp <dig> or anti-ptp1b antibody, it is possible that at a concentration of  <dig> μm nsc's primary target in these cells is shp <dig>  moreover, unlike nsc, several control drugs against proteins unrelated to shp <dig> had no effect on achr clustering   <cit> .

the above results and those showing enhanced achr clustering in c <dig> mouse myotubes following the depletion or inhibition of shp <dig>  <cit>  support the conclusion that in xenopus muscle cells, as in mouse myotubes, shp <dig> limits the formation of achr clusters. but does shp <dig> also mediate the dispersal of pre-patterned achr clusters? to answer this we again used nsc-treatment and examined the achr clusters that form spontaneously in xenopus muscle cells that have been in culture for  <dig> or more days. these large achr clusters, which are often more than 10– <dig> μm across and were previously referred as "hot spots", were the ones considered here to be "pre-patterned" because they develop without synaptogenic stimulation. these pre-patterned clusters are stable for several days and do not disperse on their own, but they are rapidly disassembled when muscle cells are innervated by co-cultured nerves or when the cells are exposed to agrin or growth factor-coated beads  <cit> . we have previously demonstrated that the rate of dispersal of a pre-patterned cluster is directly related to its distance from a synaptogenic stimulation site as well as to the strength of the external stimulus  <cit> . in all experiments described below, muscle cells were labeled with r-btx before synaptogenic stimulation so that the true disassembly of pre-patterned clusters could be followed, and, in all cases, untreated  cells from the same culture preparation were examined in parallel to confirm that pre-patterned clusters had developed normally. these control cells additionally showed that during the course of the assays  there was no significant increase in spontaneous achr clustering, which is in accord with our previous work  <cit> . this point is important to consider because the rapid, net decrease in the number of pre-patterned achr clusters that follows synaptogenic stimulation demonstrates that external stimuli actively disperse old achrs clusters rather than merely preventing  the assembly of additional, new pre-patterned clusters . indeed, we have previously used growth factor-coated beads and time-lapse imaging of identified pre-patterned clusters to show their dispersal by applied stimuli in live cells  <cit> . lastly, in this study pure muscle cultures were used throughout to avoid any  presynaptic effect of nsc- <dig> that could potentially influence achr redistribution in nerve-muscle co-cultures.

in r-btx-labeled muscle cells, overnight treatment with agrin generated achr micro-clusters  and triggered the loss of pre-patterned clusters  as described before  <cit> ; in the absence of agrin pre-patterned clusters remained unaffected . in contrast, in muscle cells exposed to agrin plus nsc- <dig>  both small achr clusters and the larger aggregates resembling pre-patterned achr clusters were detected . similarly, small and large achr clusters were present on the surface of muscle cells treated with agrin and the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate  as shown previously  <cit> . these results suggested that agrin-dependent dispersal of pre-patterned achr clusters was blocked by the inhibition of shp <dig> 

to accurately quantify nsc's effect on dispersal, we stimulated muscle cells with beads coated with heparan-binding growth-associated molecule , which induce clusters of achrs associated with proteins that are also found at nerve-muscle synapses and achr clusters generated by agrin  <cit> . these beads generate achr clusters only at sites where they directly contact muscle cells, which eliminates any chance of mistaking induced achr clusters for pre-patterned ones  <cit> , and the ability to count separately these dissimilar  clusters makes it possible to easily distinguish an increase of spontaneous achr clustering caused by a drug-treatment  from the inhibition of cluster disassembly . following overnight stimulation with hb-gam beads, achr clusters were found at bead-muscle contacts in both control and nsc-treated cells, but unlike in control cells, in nsc-treated cells pre-patterned achr clusters were also readily detected . we determined the percentage of beads that induced new achr clusters and counted the pre-patterned achr clusters that were present on cells after exposure to beads. the latter numbers were then normalized relative to those obtained from untreated and nsc-treated cells examined in parallel to which beads had not been added – this was done to compensate for any potential change  in the number of pre-patterned clusters that might have arisen during the assay period. our pooled data showed that nsc-treatment inhibited bead-stimulated dispersal of pre-patterned achr clusters  but not the induction of new achr clusters . these results also indicated that cluster dispersal was not blocked due to an inability of the beads to initiate signaling per se in the presence of the shp2-inhibitor. this selective inhibition of dispersal by nsc-addition is akin to what is observed when muscle cells are exposed to pervanadate, but it differs from the effects of other compounds that either do not influence dispersal or which suppress dispersal by blocking synaptogenic signaling  <cit> .

to directly evaluate nsc-87877's effect on the achr cluster disassembly process, muscle cells were stimulated with hb-gam beads for  <dig> h and stained with a monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine . because the loss of phosphotyrosine labeling precedes the depletion of achrs from moribund pre-patterned clusters, the phosphorylation state of achr-containing clusters  can be used to measure the spread of the dispersal signal  <cit> . when we examined the phosphorylation of pre-patterned achr clusters in muscle cells in which beads had induced new achr clusters, the pre-patterned clusters in control cells were found to be tyrosine dephosphorylated significantly more  than those in nsc-treated cells . in the examples shown , the pre-patterned achr cluster in the control muscle cell is devoid of phosphotyrosine whereas the one in the nsc-treated cell has lost but a tithe of its phosphotyrosine. pooled data were quantified by sorting pre-patterned achr clusters in bead-stimulated cells  as being fully tyrosine phosphorylated, partially dephosphorylated  and completely dephosphorylated . these results indicated that shp2-inhibition hindered the spread of the achr cluster dispersing signal .

the above nsc- <dig> data suggest that shp <dig> signaling promotes the disassembly of pre-patterned achr clusters, which agrees with and extends our earlier finding that tyrosine phosphatase activity mediates achr cluster dispersal  <cit> .

exogenous shp <dig> expression and achr cluster dispersal
to investigate shp2's influence on achr cluster dispersal using a different approach, we next examined muscle cells expressing exogenous shp <dig> proteins. for this, mrnas encoding wild-type shp <dig> , constitutively active shp <dig>  or inactive shp <dig>  and the reporter green fluorescent protein  were injected into xenopus embryos from which muscle cells were cultured. achrs were labeled with r-btx and cells with exogenous proteins were identified by green fluorescence. in muscle cells expressing wild-type or constitutively active shp <dig>  fewer pre-patterned achr clusters were found than in cells expressing gfp alone , suggesting that shp <dig> inhibited the formation of achr clusters in these muscle cells as in c <dig> myotubes  <cit> . moreover, after stimulation with hb-gam beads, more complete dispersal of pre-patterned achr clusters occurred in muscle cells expressing wild-type or constitutively active shp <dig> compared to those expressing gfp only . to quantify these data, we divided the number of pre-patterned achr clusters in bead-stimulated cells  by the number of pre-patterned clusters in cells not exposed to beads ; here, this compensated for the reduced formation of pre-patterned achr clusters in cells over-expressing shp <dig>  these ratios were then further normalized using those calculated for cells expressing gfp alone. these results indicated that the presence of excess wild-type or constitutively active shp <dig> proteins in muscle cells is sufficient for promoting achr cluster dispersal . in these assays the exogenous shp <dig> proteins did not block the induction of new achr clusters  suggesting that higher shp <dig> activity and/or the activity of additional tyrosine phosphatases is required to inhibit achr clustering by hb-gam beads.

here we also tested whether ectopic expression of the inactive shp <dig> in xenopus muscle cells would significantly hinder achr cluster dispersal and found that not to be the case . this is possibly because we obtained only low-level expression of inactive shp <dig> in cells  and attempts to enhance this mutant's expression by injecting more of its mrna into embryos disrupted development as previously noted  <cit> . that shp <dig> signaling plays a role in mediating the dispersal of achr clusters, however, is suggested by experiments described below using the shp2-activator sirpα <dig> and a mutant form of it.

sirpα <dig> over-expression and achr cluster dispersal
sirpα <dig> is a transmembrane protein that, when tyrosine-phosphorylated, binds to shp2's tandem sh <dig> domains and stimulates shp <dig> activity  <cit> . we recently showed that in c <dig> mouse myotubes sirpα1's tyrosine phosphorylation and shp2-binding were enhanced by agrin-treatment and that increased sirpα1/shp <dig> signaling inhibited achr cluster formation  <cit> . to test whether sirpα1/shp <dig> signaling also regulates achr cluster dispersal, we injected xenopus embryos with mrnas encoding full-length sirpα <dig> , which can stimulate shp <dig>  or truncated sirpα <dig> , which lacks the shp2-binding tyrosine phosphorylation domain and acts as a dominant-negative suppressor of shp <dig> signaling in cells  <cit> . muscle cells expressing gfp or gfp and the sirpα <dig> proteins were exposed to hb-gam beads and the number of pre-patterned achr clusters remaining after stimulation was determined, divided by the number obtained from the cells not exposed to beads, and normalized relative to the value calculated for gfp-cells . compared to the expression of gfp only , expression of full-length sirpα <dig> in muscle cells significantly enhanced pre-patterned achr cluster dispersal by beads  whereas the expression of truncated sirpα <dig> inhibited dispersal . these effects, quantified in panel j, were produced specifically by sirpα1: in contrast to full-length sirpα <dig>  expression of a different phosphoprotein, p <dig> catenin , did not promote achr cluster dispersal, and unlike truncated sirpα <dig>  phospho-mutant p120ctn did not block achr redistribution  <cit> . taken together with our shp <dig> results, these findings suggest that full-length sirpα <dig> accelerated achr cluster dispersal by activating endogenous shp <dig> and that truncated sirpα <dig> suppressed dispersal by reducing the ability of endogenous signaling intermediates  to activate shp <dig> in response to synaptogenic stimuli.

discussion
the disassembly of pre-patterned achr clusters that occurs in muscle following motor innervation facilitates selective achr concentration at the nmj. here we studied the process by which achr clusters are disassembled by synaptogenic stimuli using primary cultures of xenopus muscle cells. we found that achr cluster dispersal was expedited when active or activatable shp <dig>  or the shp2-activator sirpα <dig>  was introduced into muscle cells, but that cluster dispersal was blocked when cells were exposed to an inhibitor of shp <dig> or when they over-expressed a mutant form of sirpα <dig> that curbs shp <dig> signaling. these results suggest that shp <dig> and its regulators such as sirpα <dig> promote the disassembly of pre-patterned achr clusters by synaptogenic stimuli during nmj development.

innervation of muscle triggers achr concentration at the nmj. for this to occur, three proteins are indispensable: rapsyn, for clustering achrs  <cit> , musk, for initiating the achr aggregation process  <cit> , and agrin, for enabling synaptic achr accumulation  <cit> . achr clusters are further stabilized by tyrosine kinases  <cit>  and the dystrophin complex proteins  <cit>  that directly or indirectly strengthen achr-cytoskeleton linkage. moreover, achr clustering requires dynamic actin polymerization  <cit> , which is regulated by small gtpases, their effectors and other modulators  <cit> , and clustering is also promoted by a transmembrane protein, lrp <dig>  <cit> , and the musk-binder, dok- <dig>  <cit> .

in addition to achr aggregation, innervation triggers the dispersal of pre-patterned achr clusters. in xenopus primary muscle cultures these two processes can be readily distinguished from one another and the redistribution of achrs in response to various stimuli can be accurately quantified  <cit> . we have previously shown that tyrosine phosphatases mediate achr cluster dispersal  <cit>  and here we identified shp <dig> as one of the phosphatases that facilitates dispersal. treatment of muscle cells with nsc- <dig>  a selective shp <dig> antagonist  <cit> , hindered the dispersal of pre-patterned achr clusters without preventing the induction of new achr clusters, as also seen with the general phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate but not other drugs  <cit> .

nsc-treatment enhanced achr clustering in xenopus muscle cells whereas the expression of active shp <dig> had the opposite effect, consistent with our results in c <dig> myotubes  <cit> . in c <dig> myotubes, however, the expression of dominant-negative shp <dig> promoted achr cluster formation  <cit>  but here no significant effect of this mutant on cluster induction was detected. additionally, because the inactive shp <dig> mutant was only poorly expressed in xenopus muscle cells, we could not test whether "dominant-negative" inhibition of shp <dig> would block achr cluster dispersal, as suggested by our pharmacological assays. but because shp2-dependent suppression of achr clustering in c <dig> myotubes could be stimulated by the phosphoprotein sirpα <dig>  <cit> , we examined if exogenous sirpα <dig> proteins can affect the dispersal of pre-patterned achr clusters in xenopus muscle cells. expression of full-length and truncated sirpα <dig>  which enhance and inhibit shp <dig> signaling  <cit> , promoted and blocked achr cluster dispersal, respectively. these results suggest that sirpα <dig>  spreads the signal that globally activates shp <dig> to facilitate achr cluster disassembly.

while our results have revealed a novel role of sirpα <dig> and shp <dig> in achr dispersal, it is likely that other, as yet unidentified proteins are also involved. this is because inhibition of all tyrosine phosphatases with pervanadate blocks achr cluster disassembly more effectively  <cit>  than reagents that target sirpα <dig> and shp <dig>  however, our current and previous findings suggest a signaling pathway for sirpα1/shp2-dependent dispersal of achr clusters in response to a synaptogenic stimulus. near innervation sites, for example, shp <dig> activated by sirpα <dig> in response to agrin-stimulation of musk could, in addition to curtailing the achr clustering signal  <cit> , dephosphorylate and increase the activity of src kinases  <cit>  in the surrounding area to trigger more sirpα <dig> phosphorylation and shp <dig> activation, and so on . such a "regenerative" signaling pathway with src, sirpα <dig>  and shp <dig> functioning sequentially was described in integrin signaling  <cit>  where it was shown that phosphorylation of sirpα <dig> leads to the activation of shp <dig>  which stimulates src that phosphorylates sirpα <dig>  because achr clusters induced in muscle cells by growth factor-coated beads and agrin contain a similar complement of signaling and scaffolding proteins  <cit> , it is possible that many of the same molecules activated following direct or indirect musk stimulation regulate the src, sirpα <dig> and shp <dig> signaling cascade. a spread of this signaling across muscle could trigger shp <dig> to dephosphorylate achr-associated proteins at pre-patterned clusters or achrs themselves, which are in vitro substrates of shp <dig>  <cit> ; dephosphorylation of achrs and/or other denizens of the pre-patterned clusters could then de-link achrs from the cytoskeleton  <cit>  and allow their redistribution.

several studies  have demonstrated that pre-patterned achr cluster disassembly occurs in amphibian and fish muscle independently of achr activity. for example, in xenopus muscle cells, pre-patterned clusters are dispersed by innervation when all achr channel activity is blocked using bungarotoxin or curare and no electrical activity or twitching is detected in muscle  <cit> . moreover, during nmj formation in vivo in zebrafish, pre-patterned achr clusters are redistributed when saturating concentrations of bungarotoxin are used or even when the bungarotoxin is added together with inhibitors of sodium channels to further ensure blockade of all neuronal activity  <cit> . thus, in these muscle cells, ach-dependent achr channel opening appears to be unnecessary for redistributing pre-patterned achr aggregates during nmj formation. whether ach can subtly influence the effectiveness with which other synaptogenic stimuli disperse pre-patterned clusters, however, requires further investigation.

in contrast to the above findings, in rodent and chick myotubes achr agonists reduce surface achr clusters  <cit>  and muscle electrical activity suppresses extra-synaptic achr synthesis  <cit> . other studies have revealed a more direct role of ach in achr cluster disassembly, as summarized by this recent model  <cit> : ach elevates muscle intracellular ca2+ and stimulates the protease calpain, which cleaves a protein named p <dig> to generate a p <dig> fragment  <cit> ; p <dig> potently activates the protein kinase cdk <dig>  which disperses achr clusters  <cit> . at the nmj agrin promotes calpain's interaction with rapsyn, which inhibits calpain and suppresses p <dig> production to locally limit cdk <dig> activity and block achr dispersal  <cit> . thus agrin is thought to protect synaptic achrs against dispersal by ach  <cit> . however, as discussed in these studies, some aspects of this dispersal pathway warrant further investigation. for example, calpain is activated in muscle more rapidly than cdk <dig>  suggesting that additional unknown factors regulate cdk <dig> during dispersal  <cit> . since cdk <dig> phosphorylation sites have not been found in achr subunits, it is also unclear exactly how cdk <dig> disperses achr clusters  <cit> . intriguingly, achr activity, which favors dispersal in embryonic muscle, stabilizes achrs during synaptic competition  <cit> , which could be due to changes in the molecular makeup of achr subunits or clusters during development  <cit> . and, the elevation of intracellular ca2+ by agonists of achrs and l-type calcium channels actually promote achr clustering  <cit> , suggesting that ca2+ can either favor achr cluster assembly and stabilization or cluster destabilization and dispersal .

roles of shp <dig> or other tyrosine phosphatases in ach-dependent achr dispersal have not been described, but phosphatase inhibition blocks ach-independent dispersal caused by defects in src signaling  <cit>  or intracellular ca2+ flux  <cit> . shp2's function at the nmj in vivo also remains elusive, although one study  <cit>  has reported that nmjs appear normal around birth in mice in which shp <dig> expression is reduced in muscle. in that study the presence of residual shp <dig> in muscle was not ruled out and the formation of pre-patterned achr clusters ~e <dig> and the dispersal of these clusters by ~e <dig> were not examined  <cit> . several other findings, however, argue in favor of shp2's involvement in nmj development: shp <dig> regulates neuregulin/erbb signaling and achr gene expression  <cit> , shp <dig> limits agrin/musk-dependent formation of new achr clusters  <cit> , and shp <dig> promotes the disassembly of pre-patterned . interestingly, shp <dig> associates with musk and is able to stabilize achr clusters in rodent myotubes  <cit> , which could be due to its ability to activate src. however, excessive src kinase or tyrosine phosphatase activity also destabilizes achr clusters in these cells  <cit> , which is compatible with our findings vis-à-vis sirpα <dig> and shp <dig> and the inhibition of achr clustering  <cit>  and the facilitation of dispersal . lastly, tyrosine phosphatases have recently also been found to regulate the membrane insertion of achrs at the nmj  <cit>  suggesting that additional novel functions of shp <dig> and other phosphatase in nmj development await discovery.

CONCLUSIONS
during the earliest stages of nmj establishment, motor innervation of muscle induces the clustering of achrs at incipient synapses as well as the disassembly of pre-patterned achr aggregates formed in muscle before innervation. in amphibian muscle, synaptogenic stimuli direct both of these processes independently of achr activity, with the former process being suppressed by tyrosine phosphatases and the latter being mediated by phosphatases. in this study we found that pharmacological or molecular manipulation of one specific phosphatase – shp <dig> – produced quantifiable changes in the dispersal of pre-patterned achr clusters in xenopus muscle cells: whereas dispersal was blocked by inhibitors of shp <dig> signaling, it was accelerated under conditions elevating muscle shp <dig> protein or activity levels. our results suggest a role of shp <dig>  in not only limiting achr cluster formation  <cit>  but also in promoting the disassembly of pre-patterned achr clusters by synaptogenic stimuli. functioning in these two distinct ways shp <dig> may enhance the efficiency with which achrs are concentrated at developing nmjs and depleted from non-synaptic regions of muscle. the participation of other muscle tyrosine phosphatases in the dispersal of pre-patterned achr clusters, by synaptogenic stimuli or by ach, and the potential involvement of shp <dig> signaling in the dispersal of achr clusters by ach remain to be tested.
