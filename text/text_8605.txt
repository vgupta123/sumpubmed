BACKGROUND
escherichia coli is a highly versatile bacterial species. commensal e. coli strains are normal inhabitants of the human colon  <cit> , but pathogenic strains of e. coli can cause intestinal and extraintestinal diseases of which urinary tract infections  rank first  <cit> . population genetic studies based on both multi-locus enzyme electrophoresis and various dna markers have identified four major phylogenetic groups a, b <dig>  b <dig>  and d and a potential fifth group e, among e. coli strains  <cit> . several studies have demonstrated a relationship between pathogenicity and phylogenetic groups. clones responsible for human extraintestinal infections frequently belong to b <dig>  and to a lesser extent d, phylogenetic groups, whereas commensal population strains are most common in groups a and b <dig> <cit> .

utis are the most common human infectious diseases and are a major cause of morbidity. it is estimated that there are about  <dig> million cases in the world per year  <cit> . uropathogenic strains of e. coli  are responsible for more than 80% of all utis  <cit> . virulence factors, such as adhesins, toxins and siderophores enhance the ability of upec to cause utis  <cit> . the ability to grow in human urine is certainly also a necessary criterion for the colonization of the bladder  <cit> . indeed, the ability of e. coli strains to survive and use resources available in urine efficiently is an important adaptation to the urinary tract  <cit> . this is illustrated by the asymptomatic bacteriuria  strains that colonise the urinary tract but do not cause disease. e. coli  <dig>  the abu strain prototype, which is unable to express functional type  <dig>  p and f1c fimbriae, grows extremely well in urine. its growth rate is high enough to overcome the losses due to micturition  <cit> .

endogenous reactive oxygen species , such as hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion radical and hydroxyl radicals are generated continuously in cells grown aerobically. they are responsible for damages on nucleic acids , as well as proteins and lipids, leading to cell death  <cit>  . defense mechanisms against the damaging effects of oxidative stress involve both enzymatic components, such as catalases and superoxide dismutases , and nonenzymatic components, such as glutathione-dependant reduction systems .

it has been demonstrated that growth under starvation conditions generates oxidative stress and significant changes in glutathione homeostasis  <cit> . the increased level of ros comes from the imbalance between production and antioxidant mechanisms. human urine is a high-osmolarity, moderately oxygenated, iron and nutrient-limited environment  <cit> . therefore, growth in urine could be perceived as a stressful environment. in order to evaluate the importance of endogenous oxidative stress of growing cells in urine, oxidative damages to lipids were assayed in a range of e. coli strains representative of various pathovars and phylogenetic groups. antioxidant defense mechanisms in four representatives of these e. coli strains were also analysed.

methods
strains
the twenty-one e. coli strains used in this study are described in table 1; nine were pathogenic, three were commensal and nine abu. the archetypal upec strain cft <dig> was originally isolated from the blood and urine of a woman admitted to the university of maryland medical system  <cit> . seven other upec prototypes, e. coli uti  <dig>  j <dig>  umn <dig>  iai <dig>  iai <dig>  ih <dig> and  <dig>  were also studied  <cit> . e. coli abu  <dig>  the archetypal abu strain, is a clinical isolate capable of long-term bladder colonization  <cit> . eight other abu strains were also included  <cit> . e. coli k- <dig> mg  <dig>  a commensal, laboratory derived strain, was originally isolated from the faeces of a convalescent diphtheria patient in palo alto in  <dig>  <cit> . e. coli iai <dig> is a commensal strain isolated from faeces of a young, healthy, military conscript in the 1980s in france  <cit> . e. coli ed1a, isolated in the 2000s from faeces of a healthy man in france, belongs to a human-specific, widespread, commensal clone that is increasing in frequency  <cit> . finally, an enterohaemorrhagic e. coli  o157:h <dig> sakai strain isolated during an outbreak in sakai city, japan, in  <dig> was studied  <cit> .

growth conditions, dissolved oxygen saturation and cell extracts
the study was performed in luria bertani  broth, a nutritionally rich medium and in human urine. three independent batches of urine from healthy volunteers were used. midstream urine was collected over  <dig> hours from healthy male volunteers, with no history of uti or antibiotic use in the last two months. the urine was pooled, centrifuged, filtered  and stored at −20°c. the growth experiments were assayed using  <dig> well plates and od <dig> was measured with a tecan infinite m <dig> plate reader. for the preparation of cell extracts, aliquots of 40 ml of pooled urine or lb broth in 50 ml vials were inoculated with the appropriate volume of the overnight culture to obtain  <dig> x  <dig> bacteria/ml. each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated in  <dig> different batches of urine or lb broth. cells were grown at 37°c under microaerobic conditions . dissolved oxygen saturation was measured by luminescence with a measure probe  in the different media during the exponential growth phase. the measure was repeated at least four times. cultures were sampled in mid-exponential growth phase and 30 min after the beginning of stationary phase. aliquots of 40 ml of culture were centrifuged at 4500 rpm at +4°c for 15 min. the bacteria were washed twice with  <dig> % nacl, pelleted and stored at −20°c until used. the cells resuspended in appropriate sonicating buffers  were disrupted by sonication on ice for 3 min  with an ultrasonic disrupter .

antioxidant enzyme and glutathione assays
the pellets were sonicated in phosphate buffer, ph  <dig> . all assays, except catalase activity, were performed on a roche diagnostics/hitachi  <dig>  catalase activity was determined using the catalase assay kit . the cu-sod activity, which corresponds to the periplasmic sod, was assayed using the sod assay kit  based on the method of mc cord and fridovich  <cit> . the cytosolic sod activity, which is effected by the mn- and the fe-sods, was calculated as the difference between the total sod activity measured at ph  <dig>  and the cu-sod activity measured at ph  <dig> . the glutathione oxidoreductase was assayed by the method of bleuter  <cit> . oxidized glutathione  was added and the disappearance of nadph was monitored at a wavelength of 340 nm. the assay of glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase  was based on bleuter’s method  <cit> , where glucose-6-phosphate was added and the reduction of nadp to nadph was monitored at a wavelength of 340 nm. the γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase  and the glutathione synthetase  were assayed as described previously  <cit> . briefly, adp generated by both enzymes in the presence of their substrates was determined using a coupled assay with pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase. oxidized and reduced glutathione concentrations were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography  equipped with a colorimetric detection system, using n-acetyl cysteine as an internal control  <cit> . each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated in  <dig> different batches of urine. the activities of the enzymes and the glutathione content in each sample were normalized with total proteins assayed by the method of bradford  <cit> .

measurement of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances 
lipid peroxidation was estimated as tbars content. tbars were measured by the standard procedure using the protocol according to the manufacturer’s instructions . when cells were either in exponential growth phase or in stationary phase, od <dig> of the cultures and tbars concentrations were determined. the pellets were sonicated in pbs buffer containing 1% triton x- <dig> and  <dig> % antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene to prevent further oxidation of lipid. each experiment was performed in duplicate and repeated in  <dig> different batches of human urine and lb broth.

statistical analysis
differences between means of at least  <dig> to  <dig> experiments were evaluated for statistical significance using the tukey's hsd  test. non-parametric data were analysed using a mann–whitney u-test. p values of <  <dig>  were considered significant. data are presented as mean ± standard deviation or as box-plots based on medians and quartiles.

RESULTS
growth in human urine is limiting
the growth capacity of twenty-one e. coli strains  was studied . as expected, growth in pooled human urine was significantly less than in lb medium, for all strains and supplementation of urine with casaminoacids improved growth . unlike lb broth, urine limits cell growth. moreover, in lb broth as in urine, it was found that all strains produced similar growth curves. only both strains abu  <dig> and iai <dig> grew slightly faster than four abu strains  during the exponential phase in urine . surprisingly, the growth capacity of abu in the urine is not better than that of upec and commensal strains.

the tbars content differs between strains grown in urine
the content of tbars, corresponding to the accumulation of membrane lipid peroxidation products was measured during exponential growth in both culture media, pooled human urine and lb broth . the levels of damage products accumulated have been used to assess oxidative stress induced by intracellular ros  <cit> . in all cases, p values were versus abu  <dig> strain. no significant difference was observed in tbars content of twenty-one strains grown in lb broth while differences occurred during growth in urine. similar amounts of tbars were produced by abu  <dig> and fourteen other strains. these amounts were significantly higher than those produced by five other e. coli strains . iai <dig> with a p value at  <dig>  was at an intermediate position. these data show that during exponential growth in urine, the intracellular ros level differs between strains. furthermore, the ros level is not linked to the phylogenetic groups. strains belonging to different phylogenetic groups were found in both groups with high and low tbars content, respectively. in the same way, no clear delineation between virulence categories was apparent . interestingly, it also appeared that strains which grew slightly faster or slower in urine e.g. abu strains  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, exhibited similar levels of tbars.

abu  <dig> strain more effectively controls the level of tbars in urine
changes in ros levels produced in the exponential and stationary growth in both pooled human urine and lb broth were studied using a representative panel of strains  . due to the sampling procedure, data obtained were subject to a new analysis of variance. the statistical analysis performed on a limited number of strains showed results quite similar to the first analysis. similar amounts of tbars were produced by abu  <dig> and cft <dig> during exponential growth in urine. these amounts were significantly higher than those produced by the four strains iai <dig>  sakai, uti <dig> and mg <dig>  ed1a and  <dig> with a p value at  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively were now at an intermediate position. no significant changes were observed in the stationary phase of growth. as a consequence, similar amounts of tbars were produced during the two phases of growth except for abu  <dig> in urine. in strain abu  <dig>  the level of tbars was higher in the exponential phase and decreased significantly in the stationary phase showing the ability of strain abu  <dig> to control the endogenous oxidative stress during growth in urine. in contrast, all isolates grown in lb medium exhibited similar levels of ros regardless of the growth phase.

* tbars values are expressed in micromoles per  <dig> cells. the data shown are means  of three independent experiments in different batches of urine and lb broth. differences between means were evaluated for statistical significance using the tukey's hsd  test.

**p values of <  <dig>  were considered significant. compared to abu <dig> under the same conditions.

the behavior of the commensal strains and upec in urine was also compared. as expected, no significant difference was observed in the amount of tbars produced . e. coli  is a diverse species, both in terms of gene content and sequence divergence  <cit> , so we then analysed strains from the phylogenetic b <dig> group only, which includes both commensal and pathogenic strains. no difference was observed between the upec and the ed1a intestinal commensal strains . however, clear differences were demonstrated in urine between the three upec strains selected  and the abu strain  <dig>  with a p value =  <dig> .

abu strain  <dig> has better antioxidant defense capacity than upec strains
the non-enzymatic and enzymatic components involved in antioxidant defense systems  were studied during growth in pooled human urine in a subset of four b <dig> upec and abu strains selected from the previous panel  . to increase the statistical power of our analysis, antioxidant defense mechanisms of the three upec were compared with those of abu  <dig>  the results are presented figure  <dig>  we also compared antioxidant defense systems between abu  <dig> and cft <dig> alone. similar results to those obtained for abu  <dig> and the three upec were obtained, however, the p values were less significant  .

glutathione system
the e. coli redox buffer in the cytoplasm is mostly composed of the tripeptide glutathione. the intracellular concentration is approximately 5 mm, and it is kept almost completely reduced . glutathione oxidoreductase  reduces glutathione disulphide , which is formed upon oxidation, at the expense of nadph  <cit> .

in urine, gsh content was low in the mid-exponential phase and then increased in all strains . however, gsh content was significantly higher for abu  <dig> than for the upec in the stationary phase. no significant difference was observed in enzyme-synthesised gsh  or gssg content between upec and strain abu  <dig> or between growth phases . gor activity was significantly higher for strain abu  <dig> than that of upec for all measurements and varied significantly between mid-exponential phase and the stationary phase .

enzymes responsible for the detoxification of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide
strain abu  <dig> growth in urine was associated with higher activity of the h2o <dig> detoxification system. catalase activity represents the peroxidase activity of several enzymes , such as hydroperoxydase i , hydroperoxydase ii  and the alkyl hydroperoxydase   <cit> . catalase activity of strain abu  <dig> was significantly higher in mid-exponential phase and stayed the same in stationary phase, for both groups . enzymes responsible for superoxide radical o <dig> - detoxification were induced more during growth and were also more active in this strain. all superoxide dismutases, periplasmic and cytosolic activity increased significantly during growth, becoming significantly greater in the stationary phase for strain abu  <dig> only . moreover, glucose- <dig> phosphate dehydrogenase  activity of strain abu  <dig> was significantly greater in the mid-exponential phase, and decreased to levels similar to those of upec in the stationary phase . this more active g6pdh could contribute to the synthesis of antioxydants .

as shown above, abu  <dig> growth in urine was related to a significantly higher level of tbars in the mid-exponential phase. the high level of antioxidant defenses of strain abu  <dig> resulted in a decrease of tbars, so there was no difference in the levels of tbars in the stationary phase between abu strain  <dig> and cft <dig> or three upec.

discussion
our studies demonstrate that growth in urine may be associated with endogenous oxidative stress. it is well known that urine supports bacterial growth. several studies have shown that upec strains grow well in human urine, whereas faecal isolates tended to grow more poorly  <cit> . other studies have also reported that abu isolates grow faster than upec strains  <cit> . however, alteri and mobley have recently shown that growth in urine is not restricted to upec bacteria or abu strains. commensal and enteropathogen e. coli strains produced growth curves indistinguishable from those of upec  <cit> . in agreement with their work, we found that the ability to grow of twenty-one e. coli belonging to different pathovars and phylogenetic groups was nearly similar in pooled human urine. the slow growth of a few isolates could reflect the rpos polymorphism in e. coli population  <cit> .

cultures were grown in microaerophilic conditions , where oxygen levels are similar to those in the human urinary tract  <cit> . this reduction in oxygen content leads to a redistribution of metabolic fluxes between fermentation and respiration  <cit> . such a shift may decrease the respiratory chain-mediated generation of ros. moreover, in our culture conditions, autoxidizable enzymes such as l-aspartate oxidase and fumarate reductase should not contribute significantly to the formation of h2o <dig>  however, metabolic reactions that generate nearly two-thirds of h2o <dig> are not yet identified  <cit> . therefore, we can expect that changes in metabolic fluxes generate different ros levels. analysis of metabolic capabilities in a collection of  <dig> e. coli  natural isolates  <cit>  and of gene expression in strains abu  <dig> and cft <dig> grown exponentially in urine  <cit>  revealed significant differences in their metabolic capacities. these metabolic changes could therefore generate different ros levels in our isolates.

urine is a complex growth medium and e. coli  must adapt to stress imposed by this tough environment. the high osmolality, high urea concentration, low ph and the limitation of certain components could provoke an oxidative response. to protect from these highly reactive intermediates, cells possess a defense system consisting of both enzymatic and non- enzymatic antioxidants that scavenge them. nevertheless, under several situations, the rate of generation of ros exceeds that of their removal and oxidative stress occurs. the levels of damage products accumulated  mirror the intensity of oxidative stress. our results demonstrate that e. coli strains can respond very differently to stress imposed by urine. tbars measurements revealed that many e. coli are exposed to ros during exponential growth in urine. surprisingly, this is the case of abu strain  <dig> that is very well adapted to growth in the urinary tract  <cit> . in contrast, two other abu strains  <dig> and  <dig>  as uti <dig>  sakai and mg <dig> showed a lower oxidative damage to lipid. no clear correlation between ros level and the phylogroups or pathogenic group was apparent.

abu isolates form a heterogenous group. individual abu strains display many differences between them in their genome contents and in virulence-associated genes such as lps, microcin, aerobactin, and mobility  <cit> . interestingly, our study shows that the two abu strains  belonging to the group b <dig>  differ from other by the low ros production in urine.

the commensal-like abu  <dig> strain and the pathogenic strain cft <dig> are very closely related and belong to the same b <dig> subgroup ii  <cit> , or to the same sequence type  <dig> clonal group  <cit> . these both strains are genetically very similar and differ only by a few hundred genes  <cit> . however, strain abu  <dig> is able to outcompete cft <dig> strain in urine  <cit> . the results presented herein indicate that both strains undergo an oxidative stress during the exponential growth. nonetheless, abu  <dig> strain displays more active antioxidant defenses which led to a significant decrease in ros level in stationary phase. our results agree with the gene expression profiling in strains abu  <dig> and cft <dig> in urine, which showed that soda, encoding superoxide dismutase and ahpc, encoding hydroperoxide reductase are significantly up-regulated  <cit> . interestingly the highest expression values were obtained in abu  <dig> strain  <cit> . to further explore the oxidative response, other studies will be performed to examine the contribution of each factor involved in this response and the importance of metabolic changes in these isolates.

the upec strains cft <dig> ,  <dig>  and uti <dig>   <cit>  are very well adapted for growth in the human urinary tract and present similar antioxidant defense systems. however, a clear distinction can be drawn between them. strains cft <dig> and  <dig> behave similarly with respect to ros formation in exponential phase in contrast to uti <dig> . the metabolic fluxes could be distributed differently in uti <dig>  which may decrease the endogenous production of ros.

the more efficient antioxidant metabolism related to greater exposure to endogenous oxidative stress may be responsible for the difference in lifestyle between abu  <dig> and cft <dig> strains. abu  <dig> strain exploits urine more efficiently than upec strains  <cit> . previous study has shown that a more active antioxidant defense system increases the capacity to colonize the bladder  <cit> . thus, a high level of antioxidant defenses associated to fast growth in the urine , low abundance of fimbriae, and possible biofilm formation  <cit>  could explain why abu <dig> strain is able to establish a long-term bacteriuria. additionally, ros are implicated in dna mutagenesis which may be adaptive as reported in biofilm for antibiotic-resistance  <cit> , or more generally, during starvation  <cit> . the high levels of ros in abu strain  <dig> may explain the genetic alterations described  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we showed that growth in human urine of many e. coli strains belonging to different phylogenetic groups and pathovars was associated with an endogenous oxidative stress. the growth of abu strain  <dig> was associated with a high level of ros and more active antioxidant defenses. the increased level of ros may be responsible for adaptive mutations. a more active antioxidant defense system could increase the capacity to colonize the bladder.
