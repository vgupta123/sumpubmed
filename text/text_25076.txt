BACKGROUND
west nile virus , a single stranded rna flavivirus, is a member of the japanese encephalitis virus  serocomplex. initially isolated in  <dig>  it has become endemic in africa, the middle east and parts of asia and europe  <cit> . wnv infection of humans typically results in subclinical or non-specific, mild febrile illnesses. however, about  <dig> in  <dig> patients will develop encephalitis and meningitis with high lethality rate due to virus invasion into the central nervous system   <cit> . since  <dig>  the virus has increasingly gained importance in north america as it caused an epizootic among birds and horses and an epidemic of meningitis and encephalitis in humans  <cit> . to date, no pharmacological treatment options for wnv-infected patients exist.

apoptosis is a highly conserved mode of programmed cell death, commonly mediated by the activation of caspases  <cit> . although neurons are regarded as the major target of wnv in vivo  <cit> , wnv infection has been shown to induce apoptosis in different cell lines in a similar manner in vitro  <cit> . this includes a wide range of different cell types such as mouse fibroblasts , mouse neuroblastoma cells , mouse embryonic stem cells, vero cells , human ovarian carcinoma cells , human neuroblastoma cells , leukemic cells , and human rhabdomyosarcoma cells   <cit> . different wnv proteins  and non-structural protein  <dig> ) were shown to induce caspase-dependent apoptosis when transfected into cells  <cit> . analysis of the influence of wnv infection on the gene expression of a <dig>  cells using microarray technique indicated upregulation of apoptosis-related genes  <cit> . although neural cells were used, no further evaluation of the distinct mechanism of cell death was performed. recently, it was shown that wnv-infection induces caspase- <dig> activation and apoptosis in brains of wild-type mice and in primary cns-derived mouse neurons  <cit> . both, caspase-3-/- genotype as well as treatment with caspase inhibitors decreased virus-induced cell death. however, role of upstream apoptosis pathways was not studied.

wnv infection-induced cell death may contribute to fatal wnv disease  <cit> . therefore, thorough knowledge of the molecular mechanism of wnv-induced neural cell death will allow us to better understand the progression of wnv infection and the associated neurological pathology. here, we used human glioma cell line t98g that is highly susceptible to wnv-induced apoptosis to investigate the contribution of caspase-dependent apoptosis to wnv infection-induced cell death. the potential of caspase inhibitors to increase viability of wnv-infected cell cultures was examined.

RESULTS
virus growth
when t98g cell cultures were infected at moi  <dig>  infectious virus titres increased from undetectable levels at  <dig> h p.i. to a maximum of  <dig>  ×  <dig> tcid50/ml at  <dig> h p.i. . infection at moi  <dig> resulted in  <dig> -fold  and  <dig> -fold  higher infectious titres  <dig> and  <dig> h p.i. relative to cultures infected at moi  <dig> . both infectious virus titres of cultures infected at moi  <dig>  and moi  <dig> rapidly decreased after reaching their maximum and were similar at  <dig> h  and  <dig> h  p.i. in contrast to decreasing infectious virus titres after a maximum at  <dig> h p.i., intracellular virus e protein accumulated in the infected cells as shown by western blot analysis .

induction of cytopathic effect 
in t98g cells infected at moi  <dig>  first signs of a characteristic cpe appeared  <dig> h p.i. impressing as rounding of the cells and detachment from the monolayer. the intensity of cpe increased with time and was highly noticeable at  <dig> h p.i. . in cultures infected at moi  <dig>  occurrence of cpe was delayed by approximately  <dig> h relative to cultures infected at moi  <dig> .

wnv infection reduces cell viability and induces parp cleavage in t98g cells
wnv infection markedly decreased cell viability of t98g cells in a time dependent manner as measured by mtt assay . this loss of viability was also dependent on the moi at which the cultures were infected. at  <dig> h p.i. cell viability of wnv-infected cultures decreased to  <dig>  and  <dig> % when infected at moi  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. to show whether wnv-induced cell death was due to apoptosis quantitative analysis of parp cleavage into proteolytic fragments was performed. at  <dig> h p.i. the amount of cells that stained for the  <dig> kd fragment of parp was  <dig> -fold higher than that of the mock infected control. induction of apoptosis depended on viral replication as inactivated wnv failed to induce parp cleavage .

wnv infection induces caspase activation and cytochrome c release in t98g cells
western blots performed with protein extracts of wnv-infected and mock-infected cultures at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h p.i. showed cleavage of the initiator caspases, caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig> and truncation of bid in infected cells. a  <dig> kd band, representing full-length pro-caspase- <dig>  was detected in all the lysates of mock-infected cultures with constant intensity. in wnv-infected cultures  this band decreased in intensity and was below detectable level at  <dig> h p.i. . a  <dig> kd band, corresponding to the cleavage product of caspase- <dig>  was absent in the protein lysates of mock-infected cultures but became apparent in the protein lysates of cultures infected with wnv  at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h p.i. the intensity of this  <dig> kd band increased with time . in all mock-infected cultures a  <dig> kd band representing full-length bid was detected with constant intensity. in wnv-infected cultures this band intensity decreased, indicating bid truncation during wnv-infection .

quantification of cytochrome c release showed that at  <dig> h p.i.  <dig> % of the wnv infected cells  did not stain for mitochondrial cytochrome c compared to  <dig> % of the mock infected control. the amount of negative cells increased to  <dig>  and  <dig> % at  <dig> and  <dig> h p.i., respectively in wnv-infected cells compared to  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the mock infected control . activation of caspase- <dig> was additionally quantified by immune-staining of infected cells. at  <dig> h p.i.  <dig> % of the cells infected with wnv  stained for cleaved caspase- <dig> compared to  <dig> % of the mock infected control. this amount increased to  <dig> % at  <dig> h p.i. compared to  <dig> % of the mock infected control .

inhibition of wnv-induced parp-cleavage by caspase inhibitor peptides
virus-induced parp cleavage was strongly inhibited when caspase- <dig> inhibitor  caspase- <dig> inhibitor  and pan-caspase inhibitor  were added directly to the cell culture medium of wnv-infected cells . all caspase inhibitors inhibited parp cleavage in a dose-dependent manner. z-vad-fmk exerted the strongest inhibitory effects on parp cleavage, followed by z-ietd-fmk. however, addition of z-lehd-fmk resulted in the weakest inhibition of parp cleavage.

pan-caspase inhibition prevents wnv-induced cell death without affecting infectious virus titre production
the addition of  <dig> μm z-vad-fmk directly to the cell culture medium of wnv-infected  t98g cell cultures prevented virus-induced cell killing as assessed by the trypan blue dye exclusion assay . to exclude that this finding was an effect of altered viral replication due to z-vad-fmk treatment, virus-titres of wnv-infected cultures  treated with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm z-vad-fmk were compared. caspase inhibition had no effect on infectious virus titres at  <dig> h p.i. .

discussion
the human glioma cell line t98g is permissive for wnv infection as demonstrated by the production of infectious virus and viral antigens. in the present study, we used this cell culture system to study effects of wnv infection on apoptosis induction in brain-derived cells. wnv infection killed t98g cells in a time dependent manner. although maximum virus titre was achieved  <dig> h p.i., wnv proteins continued to accumulate in infected cells at later times. the accumulation of viral proteins correlated with decreasing cell viability and the level of observed cytopathic effects. similar observation demonstrating that the induction of cell death can happen independently of wnv-replication were made before using other cell types including human kidney cell line  <dig> and human retinal pigment epithelial cells  <cit> . taken together, these data suggest that the treatment with inhibitors of virus replication at later time points p.i. may be limited in preventing wnv-induced pathogenicity. therefore, substances that inhibit wnv-induced cytotoxic effects may be used as additional treatment options in the therapy of wnv diseases to improve outcome.

many viruses including wnv have been shown to induce apoptosis in their target cells in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . activation of both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways has been described during viral infections. the extrinsic apoptotic pathway is initiated by binding of death activators  to their respective transmembrane death receptors. this binding allows interaction with cytoplasmatic adaptor proteins  which subsequently activates caspase- <dig>  the activation of caspase- <dig> leads to effector caspases  activation and the degradation phase of apoptosis  <cit> . the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is initiated by signalling from pro-apoptotic proteins of the bcl- <dig> family such as bax which trigger mitochondria-outer-membrane-permeabilisation  followed by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytoplasma in the induction phase. cytochrome c then associates with apaf- <dig>  caspase- <dig>  and atp to form the apoptosome. the apoptosome, similar to caspase- <dig> then induces the degradation phase of apoptosis via activation of effector caspases  <cit> . these pathways cross-interact rather than being single linear mechanisms. it has been suggested that cleavage of bid by caspase- <dig> can induce momp with subsequent release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasma  <cit> .

wnv infection induces apoptosis in different cell types under involvement of components of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. wnv infection as well as gene delivery of wnv capsid into the monkey kidney cell line vero, induced apoptosis through a mitochondrial-based caspase- <dig> pathway  <cit> . in mouse neuroblastoma cell line neuro-2a, wnv infection induced upregulation of bax gene expression  <cit> . moreover, the wnv ns <dig> induced host cell apoptotic pathways involving caspase- <dig> and - <dig> in different cell types  <cit> . recently, aspects of wnv-induced apoptosis in neural cells were studied in wild-type and caspase-3-/- mice and primary cns-derived mouse neurons  <cit> . caspase- <dig> activation and dna-fragmentation were demonstrated in brains of infected animals and in neuronal cultures. it was shown that, caspase- <dig> deficiency significantly decreased wnv-induced death of treated animals. our results are in concert with these findings, demonstrating that our culture system may be useful to study virus-induced cell death in neuronal cells. in contrast to this recently published report  <cit> , we also evaluated the apoptotic-pathways upstream of caspase- <dig> activation. our data reveal that wnv infection induces caspase- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> activation, parp cleavage, momp, as indicated by cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, and cell death in t98g cells. the induction of apoptosis in t98g cells was replication-dependent as uv-inactivated virus did not induce death of treated cells. the wnv-induced parp cleavage in t98g cells was strongly inhibited by the use of a pan-caspase inhibitor. furthermore, inhibition of caspase activity inhibited virus-induced cell killing without affecting virus replication. this demonstrates that wnv-induced apoptosis plays a significant role in wnv-induced death of t98g cells.

wnv infection induced cleavage of the effector caspase- <dig> and the initiator caspases- <dig> and - <dig>  suggesting contribution of both, the extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptotic pathways to wnv-induced apoptosis. in concordance, inhibition of caspase- <dig> as well as inhibition of caspase- <dig> significantly inhibited wnv-induced parp cleavage. bid truncation/activation in wnv-infected t98g cells suggests cross-talk between the extrinsic and the intrinsic caspase pathways.

inhibition of host cell apoptosis may improve outcome with or without affecting virus replication in different viral diseases. two broad-spectrum caspase inhibitors were shown to inhibit reovirus-induced myocardial pathogenesis and to improve survival in mice, without exerting inhibitory effects on virus replication  <cit> . coxsackievirus b <dig> induced apoptosis and cytopathic effects were prevented by inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase  <dig> beta  in cell culture  <cit> . apoptosis inhibition also prevented cytopathic effects of flaviviruses. a pancaspase inhibitor prevented jev apoptosis in murine  and human  neuronal cell lines  <cit> . treatment of n <dig> cells with dehydroepiandrosterone suppressed jev-induced cytopathic effects and jev-induced apoptotic cell death without influencing virus replication  <cit> . moreover, in vitro treatment of primary neurons with ifn-ß either before or after infection increased neuronal survival independently of its effects on wnv replication  <cit> , demonstrating that neuroprotective agents might be useful to prevent wnv induced neural damage. however, cell death in vivo is much more complex and involves multiple regulators. to underscore a need for detailed studies of apoptosis it should be noted that there are recent studies showing that apoptotic cells may induce apoptosis in neighbouring healthy cells through bystander-mediated events  <cit> . this possibility has not been ruled out in the wnv infected brain.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that wnv infection induces cell death in the brain-derived tumour cell line t98g by apoptosis under involvement of constituents of the extrinsic as well as the intrinsic apoptotic pathways. pan-caspase inhibition prevented wnv-induced parp cleavage as well as cell death without affecting virus replication. our results illuminate the molecular mechanism of wnv-induced neural cell death.
