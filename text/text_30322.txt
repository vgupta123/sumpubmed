BACKGROUND
the peroxidase from horseradish roots  is the most widely studied peroxidase, due mainly to its many diverse uses in biotechnology  <cit> . several reports of hrp immobilisation exist, commonly employing adsorption as the immobilisation technique  <cit> . although simple to implement, this approach suffers from several drawbacks, including the removal of adsorbed protein by stringent washing, high contamination  and denaturation of proteins adsorbed onto hydrophobic surfaces  <cit> . covalent immobilisation of proteins offers a more robust approach. traditionally, immobilisation of plant hrp relied on periodate oxidation of the enzyme's carbohydrates. in recent years, however, immobilisation technology has developed rapidly, primarily due to the increase in number and range of activated solid supports and the ability to engineer or chemically modify biomolecules to enable easier covalent attachment. several protein-engineering strategies have introduced reactive amino acids to promote directed protein immobilisation, with lysine being the most common. abian and co-workers  <cit>  selected asparagine, glutamic acid or arginine residues of pencillin g acylase  for replacement by lysine; these substitutions resulted in improved thermal stability of the immobilised pga, due to multipoint attachment to a glyoxyl agarose-activated solid phase. hrpc is a highly cationic protein that contains twenty-one arginine residues  <cit> ; however, only arg residues on the opposite side to the active site entrance were considered for substitution in the present study, as attachment to the solid phase via the "back" of the molecule should allow an orientated rhrp immobilisation. this primary condition was supplemented with additional structural criteria  and led to the substitution of arg <dig>  arg <dig> and arg <dig>  by lysines, thus permitting the investigation of orientated covalent attachment to two activated solid phases, polyethersulfone membrane and cnbr-activated sepharose™.

RESULTS
immobilisation on pes membrane
use of a modified pes membrane permitted successful orientated rhrp immobilisation. introduction of arg to lys substitutions  on the opposite face of the molecule to the active site, together with the removal of wildtype reactive lysine residues , forces the protein to orientate its active site away from the membrane and towards the bulk solution phase during covalent immobilisation. figure  <dig> demonstrates faster and more intense colour development for mutant  <dig> over an eighteen-hour period compared with wildtype. densitometrical analysis  using image j software confirms and underscores this point. equal concentrations of mutant  <dig>  mutant  <dig> , mutant  <dig>  mutant  <dig> , and wildtype rhrp were applied . increased catalytic activity towards dab substrate is attributed to optimal orientation of the rhrp molecule , in contrast to the random orientation of wildtype rhrp or reduced binding capabilities of k283r revertants . furthermore, this experimental set-up also demonstrated reusability. immobilised mutant  <dig> was stained repeatedly  with tmb  over a period of several hours, with appreciable catalytic activity noted each time.

plant, wt, wildtype; mutant  <dig>  r118k/r159k/r283k; mutant  <dig>  r118k/r159k; mutant  <dig>  r118k/r159k/k232n/k241f/r283k; mutant  <dig>  r118k/r159k/k232n/k241f. % values were calculated using the 'analyse' function of imagej software package  <cit> .

stability properties of arg → lys mutants
stabilities in free solution of mutants 1– <dig> were compared with wildtype. mutant  <dig> displayed almost identical thermal and solvent stabilities  to wildtype rhrp. mutant  <dig> was notably less stable . this was unexpected, as the chemically modifiable proximal lysine residues  had been mutated to the stabilising phe and asn respectively . mutant  <dig>  displayed a  <dig> -fold increase in t1/ <dig> at 50°c over mutant  <dig> and a  <dig> -fold increase versus wildtype. however, mutant  <dig>  and mutant  <dig>  displayed very similar thermal stabilities. solvent stability was also affected by reversion to arg at position 283: mutant  <dig> exhibited a 1/ <dig> increase in c <dig> in dmf, but decreases in dmso  and meoh  tolerances compared with mutant  <dig>  mutant  <dig> displayed decreased stabilities in dmso  and meoh .

interestingly, both reversion mutants displayed greater h2o <dig> stability in free solution than their unreverted counterparts .

immobilisation on cnbr-activated sepharose
increased lysine content correlated with increased immobilisation on cnbr-activated sepharose: mutant  <dig>  < wildtype  < mutant  <dig>  < mutant  <dig>  < mutant  <dig> . these calculations were based on measured units of activity before and after immobilisation, assuming that no inactivation occurred during the mild immobilisation process. immobilised wildtype demonstrated more than two-fold thermal stabilisation, whilst immobilised mutant  <dig> displayed a marginal 5% increase. mutant  <dig> , mutant  <dig>  and mutant  <dig> all displayed decreased thermal stability following immobilisation.

solvent stabilities of wildtype and mutant  are set out in table  <dig>  small variations  in solvent stabilities are noted.

all four mutants and wildtype show a dramatically decreased resistance to inactivation by h2o <dig> following immobilisation onto cnbr-activated sepharose, approximating to a basal c <dig> value of  <dig> mm h2o <dig> . this contrasts sharply with variations in h2o <dig> resistance noted in free solution .

discussion
lopez-gallego and co-workers  <cit>  recently proposed chemical modification to enrich the protein surface with reactive groups that would facilitate multipoint covalent attachment during protein immobilisation. the present work extends this concept by substituting additional lysines in a specific region of rhrp so as to facilitate directed, multipoint immobilisation onto a commercially available, modified polyethersulfone  membrane. lysines are often exploited for covalent immobilisation, as they occur frequently in proteins and are active nucleophiles when unprotonated, i.e. at alkaline ph. they are usually located on surface-exposed regions of proteins, due to their charged nature. this characteristic also allows for simple immobilisation reactions, as lysine residues do not require activation prior to immobilisation  <cit> . to allow directed immobilisation of rhrp to an activated matrix, arginine residues were selected for conservative substitution by lysine. of the twenty-one arginine residues in rhrp, only three were deemed suitable for the proposed replacements: arg <dig>  arg <dig> and arg <dig> . these positions are located on the opposite side of the molecule to the active site; hence, immobilisation via these "new" lysines forces the protein to orientate its active site away from the membrane and towards the bulk solution. maximal colour development was noted during dab catalysis for mutant  <dig> , which can bind only in a uni-directional manner: the reactive wildtype lysines  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , on a different face of the molecule, have been removed. this directional immobilisation should allow optimal substrate access and product egress.

although introduction of additional lysines permits directional immobilisation, a stability penalty is incurred. despite its conservative nature, an arg-to-lys substitution can alter hydrogen bonding, as lysine can form only a single hydrogen bond compared with arg  <cit> . reduced hydrogen bonding resulting from the loss of three arg, coupled with substitution by a bulky aromatic phe  residue, may explain the instability of mutant  <dig> in free solution. arg <dig> is located on the last turn of helix j  <cit> . simple reversion of this residue rescued  poor thermal and h2o <dig> stabilities of the r283k rhrp mutant. whilst this reversion reduced the number of potential immobilisation sites, the stabilising effect of the k232f and k241n mutations  was evidenced . further protein engineering is required to re-introduce stability to the immobilisation mutants. the work of strausberg and co-workers  <cit>  has parallels with the present study. they removed a ca2+ binding loop from subtilisin so as to enhance its stability under metal-chelating conditions. their initial "loop-less" mutant was much less stable than the wildtype, but it proved possible to "retro-engineer" stability into the mutant, such that it out-performed wildtype under chelating conditions.

currently, there are very few reports of either direct or random immobilisation of recombinant hrp in the literature. rojas-melgarejo and colleagues  <cit>  noted the difficulty in immobilising recombinant hrp expressed in e. coli to traditional adsorbent solid phases, since it lacks the carbohydrate residues commonly used for this type of immobilisation. instead, cinnamic esters were successfully employed  as an immobilisation platform using physical adsorption in conjunction with glycosylation-independent hydrophobic interaction. wildtype recombinant hrp immobilised in such a fashion yielded an 8% increase in thermal stability. abad and co-workers  <cit>  recently described directed recombinant hrp immobilisation via an n-terminal his tag-cobalt -terminated gold nanoparticle interaction. although no stability data were reported for this method, its potential application in the convenient attachment of rhrp onto gold electrodes for biosensing is obvious. although our rhrp possesses a c-terminal his tag, we chose not to exploit this feature for immobilisation and instead adopted the strategy outlined here.

the immobilisation of enzymes can increase protein stability  <cit> ; however, by implementing orientation-dependent protein immobilisation, researchers may not only stabilise a protein, but also promote superior performance in applications such as biosensors. recent developments in the biosensing area focus on the type of bio-recognition involved in immobilisation. traditionally, lysines  or cysteines can be engineered into a protein backbone to allow for immobilisation; however, research has progressed towards controlled deposition and orientation of immobilised recombinant oxidoreductases for optimal direct electron transfer . the shorter the electron transfer distance, the greater the chance of det occurring in a biosensor configuration; hence, controlled directional immobilisation of enzymes is important for the progression of third generation biosensors. typically, physical adsorption is utilised for peroxidase immobilisation onto a metal electrode; however, other methods such as entrapment  <cit>  and direct covalent attachment  <cit>  are employed. often, these methods lead to the formation of a randomly orientated layer, either on the surface of the electrode  or within cavities . physical adsorption may result in enzyme denaturation, due to multiple contacts with the solid phase. binding of ligands, or substrate/product access and egress, may also be hindered, all resulting in poor bioelectrocatalytic activity  <cit> . self-assembled monolayers  are an attractive alternative for controlled, directed enzyme immobilisation. these highly organised monomolecular layers form spontaneously upon submersion of a solid phase into a solution containing amphifunctional molecules. the lengthy hydrophobic chain of the sam can be altered and terminated with a functional group that will interact only with a specific residue on an enzyme backbone  <cit> . in this instance, a site directed mutation could be utilised to dictate the location of the specific residue and, hence, control the orientation of the molecule . this concept has recently been adapted for use with chemically-modified plant-derived hrp by suarez and co-workers  <cit> .

other methods of immobilisation have developed in recent years, from his-tag chelation to biotin-avidin interaction. polypeptide scaffolds comprise a topical generic immobilisation method, employing a hydrophobic anchor attached to a leucine-zipper protein capture domain utilised to directionally immobilise several different proteins to a hydrophobic solid phase  <cit> .

fuentes and colleagues  <cit>  recently noted that the rate of plant hrp immobilisation depended exponentially on the concentration of reactive groups both on the protein and the support. hence, a protein is mainly immobilised by an area of its surface having the highest density of reactive groups. lysine is the key amino acid responsible for protein immobilisation onto cnbr-activated sepharose  <cit> , as reflected in the present study. only bound mutant  <dig> displayed improved stability over free-solution figures, suggesting that multipoint attachment, most evident in the case of mutant  <dig>  increases strain on the rhrp molecule. this, combined with restricted flexibility, leads to a notable decrease in thermal stability for the mutants. previous reports of destabilising multipoint immobilisation of glucoamylase also cite increased protein strain as reason for decreased thermal stability  <cit> , while the type of immobilisation resin can also destabilise the immobilised protein  <cit> . our results contrast with previous reports of increased thermal stability following multipoint attachment  <cit> . however, abian and co-workers  <cit>  focused their mutations on a lysine-rich area of pencillin g acylase, which previous chemical modification studies had proven not to be critical for protein stability, and so minimised the chance of a deleterious mutation in this area. this group also utilised a glyoxyl agarose-activated solid phase for protein immobilisation. plant-derived glycosylated hrp has previously been immobilised onto a variety of solid phases, by a range of different techniques, to increase thermal stability. for example, rojas-melgarejo and co-workers  <cit>  noted increased thermal stability  for plant hrp absorbed onto cinnamic carbohydrate esters, similar to that noted in this study for wildtype rhrp , covalently immobilised onto cnbr-activated sepharose.

the reduced solvent stabilities of the mutants can similarly be ascribed to increased strain and lack of protein flexibility. due to the confined nature of the immobilised protein, organic solvent molecules that have stripped and replaced water molecules are maintained in close proximity to the protein surface, leading to accelerated protein denaturation  <cit> . it is well known that many enzymes can function in organic solvents  <cit> ; however, protein denaturation often occurs in water-miscible solvents, by a process referred to as "water-stripping". gorman and dordick  <cit>  described how t2o  is desorbed from hrp by organic solvents such as meoh and dmf. dmf, despite its higher dielectric constant, desorbed significantly less t2o than did meoh. the difference is possibly due to structural similarities between meoh and h2o, which allow meoh to strip and replace water molecules close to the protein surface. there is a major requirement for water for hrp activity  <cit> , so any water removal will have a detrimental effect on enzyme activity. small losses of solvent stability  can be attributed to the reduced number of potential attachments for covalent immobilisation. hence, the immobilisation of mutant  <dig> is not as rigid as that of mutant  <dig>  permitting some protein flexibility.

immobilisation on cnbr-activated sepharose notably decreased h2o <dig> tolerance of rhrp wildtype and mutants: the basal c <dig> value was  <dig> mm h2o <dig>  much lower than any free-solution value. previous immobilised hrp h2o <dig> tolerance results depend on the type and reactivity of the activated solid phase. rojas-melgarejo and co-workers  <cit>  report increased h2o <dig> tolerance for hrp adsorbed onto cinnamic carbohydrate esters when the stability analysis was carried out at ph  <dig> ; at ph  <dig> , however, there was a dramatic loss of h2o <dig> stability. those authors believe that reactive oxygen species such as superoxide, generated during h2o <dig> catalysis, may have been absorbed by the cinnamic support at ph  <dig>  instead of attacking the essential enzyme residues. at lower ph, however, carbonyl groups are oxidised and do not provide a sink for oxidising reactive oxygen species, leading to dramatic enzyme destabilisation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
directional orientated immobilisation of rhrp mutants onto an activated, modified polyethersulfone  membrane has been achieved with excellent retention of catalytic activity. despite some loss of thermal, solvent and h2o <dig> stabilities both in free solution and following immobilisation onto cnbr-activated sepharose, orientated rhrp immobilisation has many potential applications including diagnostics and biosensor development. ultimately, use in these applications will require re-engineering acceptable stability characteristics into the "immobilisation mutants".
