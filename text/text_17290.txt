BACKGROUND
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder in which spinal and cortical motor neurons die causing relentlessly progressive weakness and wasting of skeletal muscles throughout the body  <cit> . affected individuals usually die within 3– <dig> years of symptom onset  <cit> . the cause of neuronal cell death is uncertain. loss of oxidative control, generation of excessive oxidative free radicals, neurofilament accumulation, excitotoxicity and mitochondrial membrane dysfunction are implicated in the pathogenesis of als  <cit> . apoptosis is thought to be mechanism of cell death  <cit> .

als is an inherited disorder in 10% of patients   <cit> . mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme cu/zn superoxide dismutase  <dig>  was the first mutation identified to be associated with fals  <cit> . transgenic mice with the mutant human sod <dig> transgene have a disease similar to human fals characterized by progressive weakness of muscles eventually leading to death from respiratory muscle weakness and respiratory failure  <cit> . how mutations in the sod <dig> gene result in als is unknown. however, the fals syndrome results not from a loss of sod <dig> function but rather a toxic gain of function  <cit> .

mitochondria may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of als and is perhaps a target for the mutant sod <dig> protein  <cit> . mutant sod <dig> has been localized in the mitochondria binding bcl <dig>  the cells primary anti-apoptotic protein  <cit> . decreased mitochondrial complex i activity has been measured in platelets  <cit> , biopsied muscle and the spinal cord of als patients  <cit> . in cultured neurons treated with pharmacologic agents that block complex i, addition of ketone bodies restores complex i function  <cit> .

because of the ability of ketones to alter mitochondrial function and the critical role mitochondria may play in neuronal cell death seen in als, we studied the clinical and biologic effects of a ketogenic diet in the g93a-sod <dig> transgenic mice model of als.

RESULTS
clinical effect of the ketogenic diet in sod1-g93a mice
a. generation of ketones: the kd fed mice showed a greater than  <dig>  fold increase in the blood concentration of circulating ketone bodies  compared to animals fed standard laboratory food  . the principle form of ketone bodies is dhb, constituting more than 78% of blood ketones. dhb showed a greater than  <dig>  elevation in the blood of kd fed animals compared to controls  .

b. measures of motor performance: rotarod testing was used to determine the effect of the kd on the loss of motor function in sod1-g93a transgenic mice. time to failure analysis  showed that through the period studied, kd fed animals maintained motor function longer than sod1-g <dig> mice fed a standard diet. the last of the kd fed animals failed the rotarod endpoint of 50% of baseline performance  at day  <dig> compared to the standard diet fed group which failed at day  <dig> . there was no statistically significant difference in the age at death between kd fed animals compared to sod1-g <dig> transgenic mice fed a standard laboratory diet 

c. body weight: the weight of each mouse was measured at three points during the study period . at the start of the study, animals assigned to the standard diet group had a mean weight of  <dig>  g compared to  <dig>  g in kd fed animals. during the presymptomatic stage , tested kd animals weighed more than standard feed mice . at the endpoint of the study, weight was  <dig>  g in the standard feed animals compared to  <dig>  in the kd fed group. the difference in weight between treatment groups was not significant although a strong trend was present . interaction between diet and time was statistically significant  indicating that the pattern of observed change of weight in kd animals was diet dependent. as expected, there was a statistically significant time effect with weight loss .

the ketogenic diet protects against motor neuron death
to determine whether the ketogenic diet protects against the motor neuron loss that accompanies the clinical symptoms of als, we counted the number of motor neurons in the lumbar spinal cord in age and gender matched wt and sod1-g93a mice at the study endpoint . wild type animals had a mean of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  motor neurons per spinal cord section. in kd fed sod1-g93a mice, there were significantly more motor neurons in the ventral horn compared to those in the sod1-g <dig> mice fed standard feed at the endpoint of the study period ) . as expected, motor neuron counts in sod1-g <dig> mice were significantly lower compared to wt irrespective of diet .

dbh effect on mitochondrial function in motor neurons from sod1-g93a mice
mitochondrial dysfunction decreases atp production in sod <dig> mutant mice  <cit> . the cause is suspected to be abnormalities in the molecular complexes comprising the respiratory chain, particularly complex i  <cit> . the ketone body of highest content, dhb, corrects defects in mitochondrial energy generation by improving mitochondrial respiration and atp production  <cit> . our studies of purified mitochondria isolated from sod1-g93a mice showed that addition of dhb increased atp synthesis by  <dig> relative luminescence units  within  <dig> minutes of exposure to substrate . within three minutes of adding dhb, the rate of atp production showed a statistically significant increase compared to disease controls  , thus confirming that dhb promotes atp production in g93a-sod <dig> transgenic mice.

to determine the particular complex that was dysfunctional in the respiratory chain motor neuron cultures were bathed in dhb  and then exposed to increasing doses of the complex i inhibitor rotenone . rotenone had no effect on atp synthesis in motor neurons at concentrations less than  <dig> nm. as the dose of rotenone increased to  <dig> nm, atp production drops to 60% in untreated neurons but remains at 90% of atp production in treated animals  . no detectable protection with respect to atp generation by dhb was found in response to treatment with complex ii inhibitor, malonate in parallel cultures at any concentration tested .

dhb protects against cell death in motor neurons from g93-sod <dig> transgenic mice
we next determined if cell death occurs as the result of reduced atp production from complex i inhibition in motor neurons isolated from spinal cords of g93a-sod <dig> transgenic mice. rotenone applied to spinal cord motor neurons caused a dose dependent increase in the number of cells undergoing cell death by membrane lysis as measured by the amount of ldh in the medium . dhb effectively blocks the effect of rotenone but there not malonate suggesting that dhb overcomes the inhibition of complex i, thereby reducing the occurrence of cell death .

to test whether increased concentrations of ldh is actually associated with loss of motor neurons, immunohistochemically labeled motor neurons with smi- <dig> were counted in three types of cell cultures: one obtained from normal mice and two from sod1-g93a transgenic mice: one culture medium was treated with rotenone; the other with rotenone and dhb . neuron counts obtained from rotenone treated cultures from sod1-g <dig> transgenic mice were significantly lower compared to neuron counts from dhb/rotenone treated cultures  or cultures from wild type animals  . neuron counts obtained from rotenone+dhb treated cultures did not differ significantly from the counts obtained from wild type animals' cultures . therefore, dhb has a potential role in slowing the rate of cell death induced by complex i inhibition.

discussion
our studies show that sod <dig> g93a transgenic als mice on a kd showed significant alteration in the clinical manifestations and the biology of the disease. the preservation of motor performance in sod1-g93a transgenic mice fed a kd diet was accompanied by a significant preservation of motor neurons in the lumbar spinal cord at the endpoint of the study. we observed a strong trend in weight change between the two groups suggesting kd fed animals gained weight faster during the presymptomatic phase and lost weight slower as the disease progressed. however there was a statistically significant relationship between diet and treatment, showing that the increase in weight in kd fed animals was dependent on their diet. we could not perform standard longevity analysis  because the data failed the basic anova requirements for normalcy and variance. however, there was no significant difference between treated and disease control groups at death. this most likely represents the loss of diet effect when weakening animals decrease food intake and therefore experience less of the benefit a diet based therapy would provide.

in primary spinal cord motor neuron cultures, neuroprotection is conferred by dbh against chronic mitochondrial inhibition induced by rotenone  but not against malonate -mediated toxicity. this neuroprotective effect appears to be associated with increased atp production in isolated spinal cord sod1-g93a mitochondria when dhb is used as a substrate .

we found that dhb protected motor neurons derived from sod1-g93a spinal cords in vitro from rotenone-mediated cell death. rotenone decreases mitochondrial proton pumping and atp production causing an increase in free radical production and subsequent neuronal cell death  <cit> . kashiwaya et al. hypothesized that the neuroprotective effect of dhb might be related to its ability to restore the substrates for mitochondrial electron transport or its ability to decrease the production of reactive oxygen species  by modulating nad/nadh and coenzyme q level in the mitochondrial  <cit> . moreover, tieu et al. demonstrated that dhb may protect dopaminergic neurons against 1-methyl-4-phenyl- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydropyridine  mediated toxicity in an animal model of parkinson's disease. they proposed that dhb infusion overcomes the complex i blockage by mptp through the generation of succinate as an oxidative substrate not through reduction ros  <cit> . consistent with a complex i bypass hypothesis, we found that dhb overcomes the toxicity elicited by rotenone in sod <dig> g93a spinal cord motor neurons but is unable to overcome the inhibition of the mitochondrial complex ii by malonate.

we found that dhb, when used as an oxidative substrate, increases the rate of atp production in mitochondria isolated from sod1-g93a brain and spinal cord. this mechanism of action of dhb is consistent with studies by sato et al.,  who found that ketones may increase the electric potential between mitochondria and cytoplasm and consequently the free energy of cytosolic atp  <cit> . in the presence of dhb the efficiency of the working heart is increased by at least 25% due to an augmentation of contractibility and reduction of oxygen consumption. ketone bodies appear to change the profile of energy metabolism and ketone bodies are metabolically more efficient than glucose or fats in mitochondrial atp generation  <cit> .

the neuroprotective effect of dhb in the als models in vitro and in vivo suggests that ketone bodies might have potential therapeutic benefit for patients with als and other neurodegenerative disorders  <cit> . the diet-induced elevation of blood ketones or an elevation of dhb to hyperketonemic concentrations might improve the mitochondrial defects by increasing mitochondrial function and atp production. this reasoning has lead to a recent feasibility study in a small cohort of parkinson's disease patients that concluded that although a placebo effect could not be excluded, resting tremor, freezing, balance, gait, mood, and energy levels were improved by the ketogenic diet  <cit> . with the possible advent of ketone esters for oral administration  <cit> , clinical trials in als involving the use of ketone bodies as dietary supplements might be possible in the near future.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides experimental evidence showing that prophylactic treatment with a ketogenic diet may slow motor deterioration and protect motor neurons through a promoting energy production in the mitochondria of sod1-g93a als mice. the neuroprotective effect by ketone bodies provides a new approach to potential treatment for als through a dietary intervention.
