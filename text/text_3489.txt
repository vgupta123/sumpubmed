BACKGROUND
sequence information and protein function
one of the main aims of computational biology is to infer protein function using sequence information. clustering of proteins in families sharing functional characteristics and derived from a common ancestor is a key purpose of sequence comparative analyses. however, algorithms used to explore sequence similarity and to retrieve homologous proteins, such as blast  <cit>  or fasta  <cit> , are not sensitive enough to find out evolutionary divergent members of large protein families, while psi-blast  <cit>  increases the sensitivity on detriment of specificity. in this scenario, an efficient strategy to detect more divergent sequences within protein families is the use of sequence motifs. these are highly conserved regions across a subset of proteins sharing the same function. in general, they play an important role in protein functions and folds  <cit> . furthermore, several motifs may be arranged into fingerprints which improve the detection of remote homologous proteins reducing the "noise" that accompanies the local alignment algorithms.

databases of motifs and domains
the most widely used biological databases that explore and classify proteins according to their composition in patterns, motifs or domains are: prosite  <cit> ; pfam  <cit> ; blocks  <cit> ; prints  <cit>  and interpro  <cit> . interpro is at present the database that includes the widest and most comprehensive classification of proteins families since it integrates the information about domains and motifs from most of the other databases  <cit> . while all of the resources share a common interest in protein family classification using sequence similarity as a key factor to achieve their purposes, the focus of each database is different. in fact, the specific methods underpinning each of them are optimal for different purposes. some databases use all-encompassing domain/profile-based approaches and they are good to detect members of divergent superfamilies . others use motif-based approaches which correspond to functional sites, being appropriated to detect members of more specific subfamilies . several of these databases also include structural information useful for the identification of globular protein domains. in general, the protein families proposed are quite large, having many members with rather different biochemical functions and activities. therefore, it is important to try new ways to achieve an improved functional assignment within the protein families.

the pndr protein family
the pyridine nucleotide disulfide reductases  is a large and heterogeneous protein family with a characteristic disulfide redox-active site together with the nadh and fad binding sites  <cit> . in interpro the pndr includes around  <dig>  proteins divided in two main subfamilies: class i  with  <dig>  sequences and class ii  with  <dig>  sequences. these two large classes are further divided in other subfamilies that incorporate subsets of proteins with some specific motifs or domains. for each subset, a different interpro accession number is given. more restrictive motifs in order to place a protein in the pndr family are the "active site class i" and "active site class ii", bearing interpro ids: ipr <dig>  and ipr <dig> , respectively.

since most proteins have multiple domains and motifs and interpro give a particular assignment for each of them, the highly conserved modules  impose strong bias in the protein classifications. in the case of the pndr superfamily, all of the proteins include one nad+ binding motif and two fad binding motifs. these highly conserved motifs bring together a large amount of nucleotide oxidoreductases that many times have quite different functional activities. in contrast to all the interpro pndr class i and class ii hits, only a very small subset of proteins are included in prosite and in prints. the prosite's active site pattern defined as pndr class i  includes  <dig> proteins and class ii   <dig> proteins. the prints' signature defined as pndr class i  includes a true set of  <dig> sequences and class ii   <dig> sequences.

type ii nadh dehydrogenase  is a member of the pndr family that catalyzes the electron transfer from nadh to quinones without energy-transduction. a large number of organisms, ranging from archaea to eukaryotes, present ndh- <dig> besides the canonical rotenone-sensitive type i nadh dehydrogenase  <cit> . the ndh- <dig> enzyme could be considered a redundant protein, but it acquires other roles in certain organisms in some conditions. for example, in escherichia coli, ndh- <dig> has cu-reductase activity  <cit>  rendering the cells more stable in front of high or very low copper concentrations in the culture media  <cit> ; in azotobacter vinelandii, it protects the nitrogenase complex against o <dig> inhibition  <cit> ; in methylococcus capsulatus, it mediates the electron transfer to the membrane-bound methane monooxygenase  <cit> . this plasticity could be associated with the presence of some specific functional motifs.

linear array of motifs to classify the pndr protein family
considering that only a small proportion of the proteins clusterized as pndr class i and pndr class ii in interpro have a prosite's pndr active site signature, a revision of this superfamily classes was performed. to achieve this, we applied a workflow to the whole pndr family that resulted in the identification of two new outgroups: class iii and class iv. the specific linear array of motifs provides a good fingerprint to describe each class. furthermore, one of these fingerprints aided to the analysis of pndr class iv leading to the discovery of a new linear motif that could explain the observed cu-reductase activity in a subset of the ndh- <dig> proteins.

RESULTS
identification of four classes within the pndr family
in order to achieve a comprehensive classification of the pndr family the following workflow was designed and performed:

 <dig> - all the sequences annotated as pndr in uniprot/swissprot database were extracted and grouped into eleven initial protein groups or clusters based on their biochemical function: ahpf, bacterial alkyl hydroperoxide reductases; dhna, nadh dehydrogenases or alkyl hydroperoxide reductases; dldh, lipoamide dehydrogenase; gshr, glutathione reductase; mera, mercuric reductase; naox, nadh oxidase; nape, nadh peroxidase; ndh- <dig>  nadh dehyrogenase-2; trxb, prokaryotes, archaea and lower eukaryotes thioredoxin reductases; trxr, higher eukaryotes thioredoxin reductases; tytr, trypanothione reductase.

 <dig> - for each one of the eleven groups a multiple sequence alignment  was built and a hmm profile was derived  <cit> . the number of proteins included in each msa was:  <dig> ahpf,  <dig> dldh,  <dig> gshr,  <dig> mera,  <dig> trxb,  <dig> trxr,  <dig> tytr. uniprot/swisprot has not enough dhna, naox, nape or ndh- <dig> sequences to construct a hmm profile. in order to obtain at least  <dig> candidates for these groups, manual retrieval of the most referenced sequences in uniprot/trembl was performed.

 <dig> - to enrich the msa of the eleven groups, new sequences were extracted from uniprot/trembl database using a two-way search method:  the database was scanned with the eleven hmm profiles;  the newly found sequences were then compared with all the groups using a second round of blast and they were assigned to a given group according to the lowest blast e-value found. the number of proteins of each final cluster after filtering out the redundancy was:  <dig> ahpf,  <dig> dhna,  <dig> dldh,  <dig> gshr,  <dig> mera,  <dig> naox,  <dig> nape,  <dig> ndh- <dig>   <dig> trxb,  <dig> trxr,  <dig> tytr.

 <dig> - each cluster was submitted to meme  <cit>  for the detection of conserved blocks. all meme parameters were set as default except for the maximum number of motifs which was established in  <dig>  based on the number of motifs present in the pndrdtase i  and the pndrdtase ii  fingerprints from prints database.

 <dig> - the groups were then globally analyzed by comparison of all the conserved blocks using lama tool  <cit> . sequences with most of their blocks in common were regrouped together and sent back to step  <dig> up to reach stable groups.

the application of the above workflow resulted in  <dig> different conserved blocks allocated along the initial eleven protein clusters . all clusters share the nad, fad <dig> and fad <dig> binding motifs. the workflow detected two large groups: the first one includes dldh, gshr, mera, trxr, and tytr and the other one ahpf, dhna, and trxb. the fingerprints obtained for these groups were similar to the previous prints annotation pr <dig> and pr <dig> for class i and ii pndr, respectively. this fact provides a good validation for the methodology. additionally, two novel clusters were segregated: peroxide reductases  and nadh dehyrogenases- <dig> . these groups include some distinctive blocks and thus they could be classified separately as classes iii and iv, respectively. the fingerprints obtained for each of the four final classes were compiled in blocks format  <cit>  and included in the additional file  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

phylogenetic analysis of the pndr sequences
in order to cross-validate the proposed classification, phylogenetic sequence analysis of the pndr protein family was performed using random selected sequences from each of the eleven protein groups. the distance matrices derived from the msas were analyzed using two different methods: neighbor-joining  and parsimony . the sequences were always segregated into four main branches, matching the classification derived from the fingerprint analysis. it is important to note that, at present, uniprot uses dhna nomenclature to designate two types of enzymes: the alkyl hydroperoxide reductases from b. subtilis and bacillus sp.  and the nadh dehydrogenases- <dig> from e. coli and h. influenzae . in figure  <dig> these enzymes segregate separately as expected, despite the fact that they have the same name in uniprot.

pndr classes iii and iv
the nadh peroxidases  are structural homologues of gshr but they do not contain a c-x-c redox active motif  <cit> . studies on nape from enterococcus faecalis demonstrated that a modified single cys residue  plays the catalytic redox role. in the same way, naox from e. faecalis has mechanistic and structural similarities  <cit> .

the type ii nadh dehydrogenases  correspond to a group of proteins widely spread in nature. only some of them have a c-x-x-c motif, but there is little information about its biochemical function. in ndh- <dig> from e. coli the c-x-x-c motif seems to be involved in copper binding and it has been related to the cu-reductase activity of this enzyme  <cit> .

the fingerprint based pndr clusterization proposed above is in agreement with the classical classification criteria, which assume that these enzymes were originated by divergent evolution from an ancestral fad/nadh oxidase and they had acquired their disulfide reductase activities independently. the segregation of the pndr family in four classes with clear differences in their disulfide redox active sites is in support of an independent evolutionary trail.

specific linear motifs detected in ndh- <dig> pndr class iv
considering that the cu-reductase function proven in e. coli may be extended to ndh- <dig> from other organisms, a specific search to detect all the putative cu-reductases within this pndr subfamily was performed. to achieve this, the ndh- <dig> subfamily was subjected to a workflow detailed as follow. first, the ndh-2s homologues were extracted from the non-redundant protein database  using mast  <cit>  with the novel array of motifs developed for ndh- <dig> pndr class iv  obtaining about  <dig> sequences. second, the sequences lacking the c-x-x-c motif from this dataset were discarded, recovering  <dig> sequences. third, the redundancy was filtered out and a final group of  <dig> sequences was obtained. this final group of selected proteins was then analyzed by three independent motif discovery methods: msa manual supervised inspection, meme and pratt automatic algorithms assessment  <cit> . the consensus regions obtained by the three methods were selected. the well-known g-x-g-x-x-g nucleotide  binding motifs were clearly found but they were not considered. excluding those blocks, the most conserved region found was around the c-x-x-c motif. the msa of such conserved region is shown in a logo representation  <cit>  in figure 3a. the logo shows the residue conservation pattern for the selected region in  <dig> sequences, which is divided in two parts  and includes several putative functional motifs. within the first part, the region between positions  <dig> to  <dig> matchs the flavin binding motif described by eggink et al.  <cit> . the conserved c-x-x-c, located consecutive to the eggink's motif, is a putative cu-binding motif  <cit> . the second conserved part, from position  <dig> to  <dig>  includes an invariant vpp motif, which could be good candidate for a cu-binding motif considering experimental evidences from a muscle protein  <cit> . in addition, cu and cu putative binding motifs are separated by a loop of non-conserved residues. this kind of arrangement for copper binding has been experimentally detected in copc, a periplasmic enzyme from pseudomonas syringae  <cit> . quinones also play a crucial role in ndh- <dig> enzymatic activity  <cit>  and therefore, the presence of a quinone binding motif is expected. in the defined conserved region, positions  <dig> to  <dig> resemble a quinone-binding motif similar to the one proposed by fisher et al. in bacterial photosynthetic reaction center  <cit> . in summary, the close association of the fad, and the putative cu, cu and quinone binding motifs provide an adequate arrangement for an efficient electron transfer from nadh to copper via fad and/or quinone. the four described motifs are assembled into a signature  that describes a subset of proteins from class iv pndr related to copper metabolism.

using this signature as a search motif, many other ndh-2s from bacteria that resist high copper concentrations were retrieved: pseudomonas putida , pseudomonas syringae , ralstonia sp. , salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium ,erwinia amylovora , cupriavidus necator   <cit> . since the pair-wise identity  in the full sequences alignment ranges from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, the conserved region found is considered statistically significant and therefore it can be related to a specific function within the ndh- <dig> subfamily. high conservation of this region reflects a relatively high selection pressure through the evolution. further experimental studies will be needed in order to test the proposed functional assignment predicted for the ndh- <dig> proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
the wide use of protein sequence analysis together with the exponential growth of protein databases justify the demand of new approaches to protein comparison and functional classification. the presented strategy proves to be efficient to perform protein clusterization based on the assignment of fingerprints , since it allows to recognize divergent members within large protein families. the proposed method is applied to the complex and large pndr protein family improving its classification and detecting two non-described outgroups. moreover, a specific array of motifs detected in a subset of proteins within class iv pndr subfamily is proposed as a new signature for ndh- <dig> proteins that may have copper binding-redox activity.
