BACKGROUND
the relaxin family of peptides belongs to the insulin superfamily and includes a group of signaling molecules that share similar gene and protein secondary structures. the genes have two exons that code for a prepropeptide consisting of a signal peptide, followed by b-, c-, and a-chains. prohormone processing and activation occurs by removal of the c-chain by prohormone convertases that cleave at dibasic junctions  <cit> . in the mature peptide, six cysteine residues form three disulfide bonds that give this superfamily its distinctive secondary protein structure. in most mammals, the relaxin family consists of two relaxin peptides, rln and rln <dig>  which share the receptor binding domain rxxxrxxi/v and four insulin-like peptides, insl <dig>  insl <dig>  insl <dig>  and insl <dig>  which have a less conserved motif  <cit> . additionally, relaxin family peptides activate g protein-coupled receptors  while other members of the insulin superfamily signal via tyrosine kinases  <cit> .

the hormone rln was the first member of the family to be studied in detail  <cit> . originally characterized as a reproductive hormone  <cit> , rln is now implicated in diverse physiological processes, via its role in stimulating the production of matrix metalloproteinases  which degrade extracellular matrix proteins and cause tissue remodeling  <cit> . by this action, the hormone is involved in parturition where it softens the connective tissues of the reproductive tract and prepares the mammary glands for lactation  <cit> ; rln has also been found to be involved in diverse processes involving tissue remodeling such as wound healing, angiogenesis and tumor formation  <cit> . in mammals, the rln gene tandemly duplicated to give rise to two additional members of the family, insl <dig> and insl <dig>  both of which are poorly understood, but which are both predominantly expressed in placenta and testis  <cit> . a more recent duplication of the rln gene, specific to humans and anthropoid apes, resulted in primates having two copies of rln, called rln <dig> and rln <dig>  with rln <dig> being functionally equivalent to the rln in other mammals  <cit> . more recently, other members of the relaxin family have been identified: rln <dig> was found to be expressed in the brain and testis of rodents and to exhibit high sequence conservation across mammalian species  <cit> . this led to predictions that rln <dig> may function as a neuropeptide  <cit> , which has received some empirical support because the peptide has been shown to be involved in the modulation of feeding activities, body weight regulation and in stress coordination, learning and memory  <cit> .

another member of the relaxin family, insulin-like peptide  <dig> , attracted the attention of andrologists after it was discovered to play a crucial role in testicular descent in young males of human and mice  <cit> . there is also evidence that insl <dig> is a survival factor for male and female germ cells in mammals  <cit> : it is expressed in significant amounts in testicular leydig cells, while in females the distribution of insl <dig> producing sites is less specifically localized, detected mainly in ovarian follicular theca cells  <cit> . however, the receptor for insl <dig>  rxfp <dig>  has been identified in a broad range of tissues: brain, kidney, muscle, testis, thyroid, uterus, lymphocytes and bone marrow  <cit> . one of the least understood members of the relaxin family is insl <dig>  which was originally identified from analyses of expressed sequence tags in the human genome  <cit> , and its expression has been detected in fetal brain, pituitary and colon as well as in the cortex of the thymus gland  <cit> . the receptor for insl <dig>  rxfp <dig>  is broadly distributed in the human body, but the colon appears to be the most prominent site of rxfp <dig> mrna expression. this is consistent with current hypotheses that it is involved in gut contractility and neuroendocrine signaling  <cit> . thus, collectively, the relaxin family is revealing itself to be a group of peptides primarily involved in reproductive processes in mammals, and at the same time plays a broader role in other aspects of mammalian physiology.

investigation on relaxin family peptides outside mammals has been limited. relaxin-like peptides have been found in the testis, ovary, and/or alkaline glands of three species of sharks  <cit>  and in bird testis  <cit> . however, there are only a few physiological studies on the expression of relaxin in teleosts  <cit> , which are an infraclass of the bony fishes, and comprise 96% of the  <dig>  ray-finned fish species and ~ half of all vertebrates on the planet  <cit> .

molecular estimates indicate that the common ancestor of teleosts and tetrapods existed ~  <dig> million years ago   <cit> . a whole genome duplication , that occurred early in teleost evolution, ~  <dig> mya, is hypothesized to have contributed to the rapid divergence of the group in part because of the opportunities that wgd's offer for acquisition of new gene functions  <cit> . after gene duplication, newly derived paralogous sequences are assumed to share similar functions to the ancestral gene. however, over time, the genes may be non-, sub- or neo-functionalized  <cit> . because the teleost wgd event is ancient, examination of the proportional frequency and consequences of non-, sub- and neo-functionalization in teleosts have provided important insights into the role of gene duplication in vertebrates  <cit> .

there have been two previous bioinformatics studies on the relaxin family  <cit> . neither study focused on the molecular evolution nor expression of the family in teleosts, but they both included sequences of relaxin family genes from teleosts. additionally, park et al.  <cit>  performed a syntenic data analysis of relaxin family genes in vertebrates and found that the common ancestor of teleosts and tetrapods harboured three independent relaxin family loci : rfla - insl5-like genes, rflb - rln-like genes and rflc - rln3-like genes. in this paper we expand upon these previous studies by including  <dig> relaxin family gene sequences from eight teleost species and by focusing our analyses on understanding the specific forces influencing orthologous and paralogous gene copy evolution of relaxins in teleosts. to this end, detailed analyses of teleost relaxin family genes were performed to assess the number of orthologous and paralogous sequences of relaxins in teleosts, their syntenic relationship to human relaxin family genes, the strength of purifying versus diversifying selection, the role of positive selection at the codon level, the relative expression of relaxin family genes in adult danio rerio using real-time quantitative pcr , and the site-specific expression of insl <dig> in d. rerio testis using in situ hybridization.

RESULTS
teleosts possess relaxin family sequences which are orthologous to four human relaxin genes
the syntenic data analysis showed that the six copies of relaxin family sequences analysed in the five teleost species are linked to four loci: two loci are syntenic to human insl <dig>  termed rfla by park et al. , and harbour teleost insl5a and insl5b ; a locus syntenic to the human relaxin cluster  termed rflb , contains teleost rln; the locus syntenic to human rln <dig>  rflci, contains rln3a and rln3b , and the locus syntenic to human insl <dig>  rflcii, contains teleost insl <dig> . rln <dig> and insl <dig> are ~  <dig>  mb apart on human chromosome xix, but they are not linked in teleosts; the genes linked to rln versus insl <dig> in teleosts split near the equivalent map position at  <dig> or  <dig> mb of human chromosome xix. a strong support was shown for the orthology between human and teleost relaxin family genes , although the linkage map for the human relaxin cluster containing rln <dig>  rln <dig>  insl <dig> and insl <dig> was less dense than that for the other chromosomes . thus, of the six relaxin family genes in teleosts, four were present in the common ancestor of humans and teleosts and two arose as a result of the wgd in teleosts .

phylogenetic analysis reveals that all teleost relaxin family genes except relaxin group with their mammalian orthologues
using the nucleotide alignment , hierarchical likelihood ratio tests indicated that the tamura 3-parameter + Γ  model was the most appropriate model of dna sequence evolution. this model was used for the minimum evolution tree based on the first two codon positions . for the bayesian trees, the gtr + Γ model of sequence evolution was employed, and partitioning and unlinking the three codon positions revealed that the rate of change was approximately four times higher at the third compared to first and second codon positions  and that the gamma parameter was  <dig>  for the first two positions, but  <dig>  for the third position. hierarchical likelihood tests of the amino acid models included in protest v.  <dig> . <dig> and bayesian methods both strongly supported the wag + Γ  model of amino acid sequence evolution which was used to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationship among amino acid sequences . although the topology of the bayesian partitioned dna sequence tree was similar to the bayesian tree based on amino acid data, the saturation of the third base position lowered confidence in the bayesian posterior probabilities  and led to some problems of long-branch attraction: the two trees shown are the distance  tree based on dna  and the bayesian topology based on the amino acid sequences using the wag + Γ model of sequence evolution .

the phylogenetic tree reconstructed from the dna sequence data support the presence of four relaxin family groups in teleosts with reasonably high bootstrap support 1) rln3a and rln3b  2) rln  3) insl5a and insl5b  and 4) insl <dig> . all teleost relaxin family genes cluster with their mammalian orthologues as identified through the syntenic data analyses except teleost rln, which is sister clade to rln <dig> with high bootstrap support  and exhibits, overall, a closer resemblance to these sequences  than to its true orthologue, mammalian rln. the three frog sequences cluster with their orthologue basal to the teleost clade: in particular the x. tropicalisrln sequence shows greater similarity to teleost rln than to mammalian rln. the bpp support for the bayesian tree reconstructed with amino acid sequences gave similar results and statistical support  to that based on dna sequence data, with the main exception that teleost insl <dig> sequences have higher bpp support  than based on the dna sequence but they do not group with mammalian insl <dig> 

teleost relaxin family genes are subject to different levels of purifying selection
the two-cluster test was performed on the topology shown in figure  <dig> and identified the following groups as having differential rates of evolution 1) teleost rln3a and rln3b exhibited accelerated evolution compared to mammalian rln <dig>  2) teleost insl <dig> and insl <dig> independently exhibited accelerated evolution compared to teleost rln3a, rln3b, rln and mammalian rln <dig> and 3) teleost insl5b showed accelerated evolution relative to insl5a.

the average value of dn/ds within each relaxin family gene or within the b- and a-chains ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>   in teleosts and from  <dig>   to  <dig>   in mammals . values were generally lower in the b- compared to the a-chain. no gene was found to exhibit, overall, evidence of positive selection in which dn/ds >  <dig>  in general, teleost rln3a, rln3b and rln had few non-synonymous changes in both the b- and a-chains; their dn/ds ratios were less than  <dig>  indicating that they are under strong purifying selection comparable to mammalian rln <dig> which had a dn/ds ratio of  <dig> . teleost insl5a exhibited similar and moderate levels of purifying selection to mammalian insl <dig>  with the dn/ds ratio in teleosts  being similar to that in mammals . on the other hand, teleost insl5b exhibited weaker purifying selection with an overall dn/ds ratio of  <dig> , and having dn/ds ratios more than twice that for insl5a in the b-  and a-chains . teleost insl <dig> exhibited similar  overall sequence divergence to insl5b. although insl5b and insl <dig> are the teleost genes under the weakest evolutionary constraint , they are under stronger purifying selection than mammalian rln and insl <dig>  which have dn/ds ratios of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, with the b-chain of mammalian insl <dig> exhibiting the highest rate of dn/ds at  <dig> .

for each gene, either teleosts or mammals were used as the foreground branch on which the alternate  hypothesis of positive selection was compared to the null model . the proportion of sites subject to purifying , nearly neutral  and positive selection  and the estimate of ω  in the free model are all given as is the likelihood  of the model. the codon positions  of the sites estimated to be subject to positive selection are indicated where significant. the null and alternative models are significantly different when  <dig> Δ l >  <dig> . *for rln <dig>  the models were not statistically different.

the branch-site model a analyses indicated that only insl <dig> exhibited evidence of codon-specific selection within teleosts or mammals. the null model was rejected when both teleosts and mammals were used as the foreground branch and two amino acids were identified as being subject to positive selection with bayes empirical bayes  values of >  <dig> . using teleosts as the foreground lineage, site  <dig> in the b/c cut site, which is valine/leucine in teleosts but tryptophan in mammals, shows evidence of positive selection. setting mammalian insl <dig> to the foreground branch, identified site  <dig> in the b-chain, which is fixed as valine in mammals but to serine in teleosts, is also under positive selection . an additional  <dig> sites were identified by the branch-site model as being potential sites of selection but none had beb values > <dig> . however, it is interesting to note that of the  <dig> sites identified by the model,  <dig> are in the b/c cut site .

the proposed names for the six teleost rfl are given along with the nomenclature used for the orthologous genes in humans, and the nomenclature proposed by park et al.  and wilkinson et al.  in takifugu rubripes and danio rerio for teleost relaxin family genes. park et al.  propose that teleosts do not have an insl <dig> orthologue. they suggest that insl <dig> adopted its role in mammals after the divergence of amphibia, and refer to the ancestral insl <dig> locus in amphibians as rflcii.

quantitative pcr analysis showed evidence of significant expression of rln3a/rln3b and insl <dig> genes in the gonads and brain of zebrafish
dna sequencing of the products amplified using qpcr confirmed the identity of all d. rerio amplification products . the results of the expression analyses of relaxin family genes in d. rerio indicated that rln3a and rln3b are predominantly expressed in the brain, although rln3b was also expressed in the gonads, while rln3a was not . additionally, the data strongly support a role for insl <dig> in both ovary and testes with additional expression of insl <dig> in the brain and gill: the expression of insl <dig> was not significantly lower than that of the housekeeping gene, b2m, in ovary, and was only marginally lower than b2m in testis . lastly, the results showed little evidence of expression of either insl5a or insl5b in any tissue: insl5a was expressed in most tissues  at low levels while insl5b showed uniformly low, essentially negligible, expression .

in situ hybridization identified expression of insl <dig> in zebrafish testis in leydig cells
a strong and specific signal of insl <dig> mrna was observed in the interstitial area in the leydig cells . higher magnification showed that the cytoplasm of these cells was strongly labeled while the nucleus remained unstained . positive cells formed clusters that were often arranged around blood vessels. there were no apparent  gradients in staining intensity in an adult testis, and all leydig cells appeared to be labeled strongly. however, although not properly quantified yet, it is possible that the size of the leydig cell clusters is larger in the periphery than in central areas of the testis. the intratubular area, containing sertoli and germ cells at different stages of spermatogenesis, remained unlabeled. taken together, these findings suggest that insl <dig> is a reliable leydig cell marker in zebrafish testis tissue. no signal was observed with the sense crna insl <dig> probe , indicating the specificity of the antisense probe generated against the sequence of zebrafish insl <dig> mrna.

discussion
reconstructing the evolutionary relationship among relaxin family genes in teleosts and tetrapods has highlighted the difficulties of determining orthologous and paralogous relationships in ancient gene families using phylogenetic data alone, in particular for small, relatively quickly evolving genes  <cit> . previous phylogenetic studies on relaxin family genes  <cit>  have also found a poor resolution of relaxin family genes, particularly in teleosts: by including more teleost species we find that only teleost rln failed to group with its mammalian orthologue and this is evidently due to very different selective pressures operating on the gene in the two groups . using syntenic mapping data, we identify that the six relaxin family genes in teleosts are orthologous to four mammalian genes: rln <dig>  rln, insl <dig> and insl <dig> with two of the genes, insl <dig> and rln <dig>  containing paralogous copies in teleosts, insl5a/insl5b and rln3a/rln3b . these results are similar to those presented by park et al.  <cit>  with the exception that we find evidence that teleosts possess an orthologue to insl <dig>  while they argue that insl <dig> arose via duplication from rln <dig> after the divergence of teleosts from tetrapods. we therefore propose that the relaxin family genes that were first identified as rlx3a-3f by wilkinson et al.  <cit>  be named based on their orthology to the mammalian counterparts: rln3a/rln3b, rln, insl5a/insl5b, and insl <dig> respectively . we encourage the adoption of this nomenclature, since there is currently considerable confusion regarding the identity of relaxin family peptides in teleosts on publically available databases.

relaxin family
only the five teleost and four mammalian species for which complete genomic information was available were included in the analyses. z-tests of whether dn/ds >  <dig> for any gene was performed using bootstrapping to compute the variance . average dn/ds <  <dig>  represent strongly purifying selection,  <dig> - <dig>  represent weakly purifying seletion, and > <dig> represents recent positive selection. see text for details.

in teleosts, these relaxin family genes are subject to strong or moderate purifying selection: rln3a, rln3b and rln are all similar in sequence and highly conserved, insl5a exhibits a slightly faster rate of molecular evolution, and insl <dig> and insl5b exhibit the highest levels of molecular evolution in teleosts, the latter having a significantly faster rate of evolution than its paralogue insl5a. using the branch-site model a test, we find evidence that one codon in teleost insl <dig> and another in mammalian insl <dig> have been subject to positive selection. lastly, we find evidence that five of the six relaxin family genes present in the model organism danio rerio are expressed in one or multiple tissues, especially brain and gonads and that insl <dig> is specifically expressed in interstitial leydig cells in zebrafish testis. the significance of these results will be discussed first within the context of the comparative analysis of orthologous relaxin family genes in teleosts and mammals and then with respect to the evolution and expression of paralogous relaxin family genes in teleosts.

relaxin family genes: teleosts versus mammals
teleost rln is more similar in sequence to rln <dig> than to its mammalian orthologue rln
teleost rln was found in  <dig> of the  <dig> species for which the whole genome was available but it is, surprisingly, absent from the d. rerio genome. the close identity of teleost rln to rln <dig>  and yet its striking difference from mammalian rln, suggest that the gene has been subject to different evolutionary pressures in the two groups. several processes could potentially have caused this such as: 1) teleost rln has retained the ancestral function of the gene while mammalian rln has diversified in function or 2) teleost rln has undergone convergent evolution with rln <dig>  certainly there is support for the hypothesis that mammalian rln has diversified in function: it exhibits the highest rate of molecular evolution of any of the relaxin family genes except insl <dig> and it has duplicated giving rise to four fast-evolving paralogues in humans and anthropoid apes - rln <dig>  rln <dig>  insl <dig> and insl <dig> , all of which are produced by human reproductive tissues  <cit> . thus, the clustering of mammalian rln with its linked paralogues, rather than with teleost rln, arises in part because the clade has a higher rate of evolution and more recent common ancestry than the clade harbouring teleost rln. this hypothesis is also supported by the phylogenetic clustering of frog and teleost rln sequences . however, the identity of the b-domain of teleost rln with rln <dig> suggests that some factor such as shared receptor binding domains may have selected for them to retain the same sequence. until the receptors of teleost relaxin family genes are known and the physiological role of teleost rln understood, it will be difficult to assess this hypothesis. although the physiological role of relaxin in mammals is primarily associated with the reconstruction of connective tissue during reproduction  <cit> , the gene is involved in several pathways not specific to reproduction, e.g. metalloproteinase activation, wound healing and reduction of fibrosis in non-reproductive tissues, that may reflect the ancestral role of the gene and its potential action in teleosts.

teleost insl <dig> shows a similar spatial pattern of expression to mammalian insl3
since the descent of testicles from the abdominal cavity is solely specific to therian mammals, insl <dig> is postulated to have adopted this specialized role prior to the emergence of marsupials  <cit> . park et al.  <cit>  propose that the duplication of rflci, that gave rise to rflcii harbouring insl <dig>  occurred prior to the divergence of amphibians and mammals but after the divergence of teleosts from tetrapods. they base this conclusion on the putative absence of an insl3-like orthologue in fish. however, by studying more fish species, we find convincing syntenic evidence that the duplication of rflci and rflcii occurred prior to the divergence of fish and tetrapods . indeed, our qpcr results show that insl <dig> was the most abundantly expressed relaxin in d. rerio and that it was highly expressed in both ovary and testis, exhibiting only marginally lower expression levels than the housekeeping gene. the in situ hybridization results additionally showed that insl <dig> is expressed in the interstitial area of d. rerio testis  but is completely absent from the intratubular section . this pattern of leydig cell-specific staining has also been identified for cyp17a <dig>  <cit>  and for 3βhsd  <cit> , both leydig cell proteins involved in zebrafish germ cell sexual differentiation.

park et al.  <cit>  show how specific changes to the receptors for mammalian rln <dig> and insl <dig>  rxfp <dig> and rxfp <dig> respectively, during early therian evolution allowed for insl <dig> to adopt its specific role in testicular descent in mammals: they further show that the gene products of rflci  activate both rxfp <dig> and rxfp <dig> in teleosts. a role for codon-specific positive selection in the evolution of the insl <dig> gene was also found in this study: insl <dig> was the only relaxin family gene which exhibited evidence of lineage and site-specific selection in teleosts and mammals. two amino acids were found to show evidence of positive selection at the 95% significance level when teleosts or mammals were used as the foreground lineage, although a total of twelve sites were included in the most probable posterior model. interestingly, three of these twelve sites were in the b/c dibasic junction. prohormone convertases activate hormones by cleaving dibasic chain junctions; our results suggest that different expression patterns between mammalian and teleost relaxin family genes may be mirrored by these convertases  <cit> . overall, our data support park et al.'s  <cit>  conclusion that the co-evolution of insl3-rxfp <dig> may have allowed insl <dig> to adopt its particular role in mammalian testicular descent, but we also show that insl3-like genes are present in teleosts and that they are also involved in leydig cell differentiation.

teleost rln <dig> paralogues show similar gene sequence and expression to mammalian rln3
examining the spatial and temporal expression of rln <dig> paralogues, donizetti et al.  <cit>  recently found evidence for the expression of both genes in adult zebrafish brain. additionally, they found expression during larval stages for rln3a in the nucleus incertus and for rln3b in the periaqueductal gray  matter, the latter being implicated in vocal communication in fish. our qpcr results in adult zebrafish are consistent with theirs, and the putative role of rln <dig> as a neuropeptide involved in feeding, body weight regulation, stress coordination, learning and memory  <cit> . interestingly, while we find significant expression of rln3b in the ovary, donizetti et al.  <cit>  showed evidence of expression of rln3b in the testis but not the ovary of adult zebrafish. even though the difference between the expression of rln3b in the two sexes deserves further attention, the hypothesis that rln <dig> performs a dual function in teleosts is supported by the work of mcgowan et al.  <cit> . they found evidence for the involvement of rln <dig> in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in mice, suggesting that it may be a signal linking nutritional status and reproductive function. collectively, these data suggest that rln <dig>  may play similar roles in teleosts and mammals, which is further supported by its high degree of sequence conservation between the two groups .

both teleost insl <dig> paralogues are well represented but, as in mammals, their role are unclear
seven of the eight examined species of teleosts harboured insl5a genes, and all the species for which the whole genome had been sequenced, additionally contained the paralogous sequence insl5b. despite its presence in the genome, the qpcr data in d. rerio were more ambivalent. while some expression of insl5a was found in several tissues, particularly brain and gill, only very low expression of insl5b was found in the examined adult zebrafish tissues.

evolution and expression of paralogous genes, rln <dig> and insl <dig>  in teleosts
our data show that rln3a/3b and insl5a/5b arose by duplication after the tetrapod-teleost divergence. it has been proposed that duplicate gene copies may 1) accumulate nonsense mutations in regulatory or gene elements and become non-functionalized, 2) diverge in the tissue or timing of expression compared to the ancestral copy and become sub-functionalized, or 3) acquire new functions and be neo-functionalized  <cit> . theory suggests that duplicated genes are most likely to be lost or sub-functionalized  <cit> , and genome wide scans indicate that about 80%-85% of teleost genes were non-functionalized after the wgd  <cit> . the relative rates of sub- versus neo-functionalization are difficult to determine, in part because sub-functionalization may lead to neo-functionalization over long evolutionary timescales  <cit> . additionally, changes associated with sub-functionalization often occur in promoter regions that regulate timing or control of gene expression and studies that examine the rate or pattern of molecular evolution in the protein coding region alone may not detect sub-functionalization  <cit> .

the data presented here suggest that the paralogous copies of rln <dig> and insl <dig> may have been subjected to different forces of "functionalization" post-duplication. the paralogues rln3a and rln3b, exhibit similar patterns of molecular evolution consistent with sub-functionalization of the duplicated copy. our qpcr data indicate that rln3b is expressed in the brain and ovary while rln3a is expressed only in the adult zebrafish brain. this result is consistent with the findings of donizetti et al.  <cit>  although they additionally find evidence of distinct differential expression of these two paralogues during zebrafish embryogenesis. seemingly, the pattern observed in adult zebrafish for rln <dig> paralogues differs somewhat from the classical definition of sub-functionalization because sub-functionalized copies are expected to diverge in temporal or spatial expression but collectively span the ancestral expression patterns, although our results are consistent with other data on the expression of paralogous genes  <cit> . on the other hand, the duplicated copies of insl <dig> appear to be subject to different selective pressures. the molecular clock analyses revealed that insl5b has had an accelerated rate of evolution compared to insl5a, and the average value of dn/ds was more than twice as high in the b- and a-chains of insl5b compared to insl5a, a pattern identified for other duplicated teleost genes believed to have undergone neo-functionalization  <cit> . support for the contention that insl5a, rather than insl5b, has retained the ancestral function is further given by the syntenic data analyses in which many of the genes linked to insl <dig> in humans are preferentially linked to insl5a . the low levels of expression for insl5a and even lower levels for insl5b suggest that either 1) we have not identified the main tissues of expression for these genes and/or 2) they are expressed at developmental stages not included in this preliminary analysis : in the future this will be explored using more detailed qpcr studies.

CONCLUSIONS
we find that teleosts harbour orthologues of four mammalian relaxin family genes: rln, rln <dig>  insl <dig> and insl <dig>  two of the orthologues exist as paralogous duplicates in teleosts  probably as a result of the wgd event that occurred early in the evolution of teleosts. by combining the bioinformatics and expression analyses performed in this study we can draw the following conclusions about each teleost relaxin gene: 1) both rln <dig> paralogues exhibit similar evolution and expression to mammalian rln <dig> and the paralogous copies appear to have been sub-functionalized, 2) teleost insl <dig> has evolved moderately quickly like its mammalian counterpart and shows similar tissue-specific expression in leydig cells, has undergone site-specific codon selection in both teleosts and mammals, and additionally exhibited high expression in the ovary of teleosts, 3) insl <dig> genes are well represented in teleosts, insl5a exhibits similar rates of evolution to insl <dig>  while insl5b shows accelerated evolution compared to insl5a and may have been neo-functionalized, 4) molecular evolutionary analyses indicate that teleost rln is operating under very different selective constraints from mammalian rln, and appears to mimic rln <dig> in its sequence evolution. taken together, these results underscore the diverse roles that relaxin family peptides must play in teleosts: further experimental work is needed to shed light on the similarities and differences of their physiological roles in teleosts.
