BACKGROUND
malaria is still a serious public health problem in tropical and sub-tropical regions, causing large socio-economic loss in the affected countries. it infects around  <dig> million people across the world, taking toll of between  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig>  million lives each year, vast majority being young children  <cit> . malaria has a complex life cycle and requires two hosts to complete it- vertebrate host  where asexual stages of malaria parasite occur and invertebrate host  where sexual stages of malaria parasite occur. malaria parasite mainly causes disease while undergoing asexual development and multiplication within human erythrocytes. a number of transcription research studies have emphasized that asexual stage development of plasmodium falciparum is tightly regulated because of gene regulation by transcription factors, acetylation/methylation of genes as well as by protein post translational modifications   <cit> . recently, the specific applications of purification methods followed by highly sensitive mass spectrometric approaches and bioinformatics have allowed large-scale analysis of ptms such as protein phosphorylation, ubiquitination and palmitoylation in p. falciparum.

the reversible phosphorylation of proteins is a major post-translational mechanism of regulation for diverse pathways and processes in the eukaryotic cells. this process is controlled by an intricate balance between the antagonistic activities of two class of proteins- kinases and phosphatases, performing phosphorylation and dephosphorylation respectively. these two enzymes predominantly act on serine, threonine, tyrosine or histidine residues  <cit> . recent experiments indicate critical role of phosphorylation in egress, invasion and host cell remodelling by plasmodium parasites . for p. falciparum, ~ <dig> phosphopeptides corresponding to ~ <dig>  plasmodium proteins have been identified  <cit> . a number of recent studies, using advances in phosphopeptides enrichment, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  approaches have revealed the kinome of p. falciparum and identified approximately  <dig> eukaryotic protein kinases  profoundly divergent to the mammalian kinases .

although a number of plasmodium phosphatases have been characterized in the past , only a single genome-wide study has illustrated the plasmodium phosphatome  <cit> . this in silico bioinformatics analysis identified  <dig> protein phosphatase  subunits encoded in the plasmodium genome  <cit> . these pps were classified into four broad families of protein phosphatases; phospho-protein phosphatases  group, ppm group, protein tyrosine phosphatase  group and interacting factor like phosphatase  group with distinct evolutionary history. the authors also reported presence of rhodanese homology domain  and protein tyrosine phosphatase like protein  in p. falciparum. while preparing this manuscript, a genome wide functional analysis of p. berghei protein phosphatases is published studying its role in parasite development and differentiation  <cit> . gene disruption analysis reveals that half of the p. berghei protein phosphatases are essential for the parasite growth. historically, protein kinases have been studied more vigorously for antimalarial and drug discovery as compared to protein phosphatases due to an early view that protein kinases confer fine protein regulation by phosphorylation, whereas phosphatases just remove phosphates without any regulation. however various studies in the last two-decade indicate that phosphatases are also regulated by various mechanisms and play as important role as protein kinases . in contrast to a large number of kinase catalytic subunits, phosphatases catalytic subunits are much lower in number. phosphatases are in general less discriminating than the most of the kinases in substrate selectivity but have very high catalytic efficiency making it highly toxic for the cells in active form  <cit> . a number of accessory proteins called phosphatase regulatory subunits controls the specificity and regulation of most phosphatases  <cit> , bringing about an element of specificity in its actions. in the present study, we re-examined the plasmodium phosphatome using plasmodb database  <cit>  and conserved domain database  analysis. the results showed identification of sixty seven putative phosphatase sequences in the plasmodium genome, which is significantly higher than previously reported  <cit> . amongst the identified putative phosphatase sequences, thirty-three do not have human orthologs and six of them are plasmodium specific . profound divergence between the phosphatome of malaria parasites from all major eukaryotic phyla suggests potential of parasite specific phosphatases as new drug targets for antimalarial discovery.

RESULTS
using the computational methods described in the methods section, we collected and screened the predicted proteomes of plasmodium falciparum, plasmodium vivax, plasmodium knowlesi, plasmodium cynomolgi, plasmodium berghei, plasmodium chabaudi, eimeria tenella, toxoplasma gondii, babesia bovis, theileria parva, cryptosporidium parvam, escherichia coli, arabidopsis thaliana, saccharomyces cerevisiae and homo sapiens for phosphatase sequences. we used text search as well as complete proteome of p. falciparum and for others organisms only text search was performed to retrieve phosphatase specific sequences as the main focus of our study was to analyze the phosphatases present in human malaria parasite, p. falciparum. we selected  <dig> phosphatase sequences from these model organism proteomes for further analysis. we could identify  <dig> and  <dig> phosphatase sequences in p. falciparum based on cdd  <cit>  and pfam  <cit>  classifications, respectively. using cdd search, almost similar numbers of phosphatase sequences were identified in other plasmodium species too. the apicomplexans included in the study have  <dig> –  <dig> phosphatases; with the exception of t. gondii, which has  <dig> candidate phosphatases identified using cdd approach. in comparison to ~ <dig> phosphatases identified in h. sapiens, the number of phosphatases is much lower in plasmodium species . amongst the  <dig> candidate phosphatases identified in plasmodium genome, only  <dig> phosphatases have human homologue, whereas six are plasmodium specific. human proteins containing phosphatase domain have been classified into six distinct functional and structural groups: protein tyrosine phosphatases , metal-dependent protein phosphatases , phosphoprotein phosphatases , lipid phosphatases , haloacid dehalogenase  and nucleoside-diphosphate-linked moiety x   <cit> . number and percentage of phosphatases belonging to each group varies among different organisms . for example, the maximum number of h. sapiens phosphatases belongs to phosphotyrosine phosphatase family, whereas majority of the a. thaliana phosphatases belong to pp2cc and mpp family.figure  <dig> 
summary of protein phosphatomes of model organisms selected for the comparative studies.




based on the classification adapted for human phosphatases and considering the other functional phosphatase domain, we grouped plasmodium phosphatases into  <dig> super families using cdd. schematic diagram of phosphatases in each superfamily is shown in figure  <dig> . conserved domain alignment of p. falciparum phosphatases are shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  table  <dig> shows the name, accession number and classes of plasmodium phosphatases analysed in the present study. identity and the number of phosphatases observed in each family remained proportionally similar in the cdd or pfam domain classifications . the protein family assignment of the phosphatases revealed interesting patterns due to the reason that we used a broader selection criterion as compared to previous studies, enabling identification of complete spectrum of phosphatases. the phosphatase family with highest number of plasmodium phosphatases is the mpp family with  <dig> phosphatases, whereas few families such as ptpla  and cyth-like_pase  have only single member. several sequences analysed in the study have more than one conserved phosphatase domain, for example pf3d7_ <dig> has mpp as well as kelch like superfamily domain. kelch family of phosphatases are present in a. thaliana and in other plants. major expansion of protein phosphatase type with mpp and pp2cc superfamily in p. falciparum was similar to that observed in a. thaliana. in h. sapiens, ptp superfamily is the largest group in contrast to other model organism studied here. these genome specific expansions probably reflect the evolutionary pressure for a flexible and complex intracellular signalling in these multicellular organisms, most likely acquired and developed during the course of evolution.figure  <dig>

phosphatase domain classification on the basis of pfam and cdd.


we further analysed various annotated phosphatase family proteins on the basis of conserved phosphatase motifs, gene ontology and its evolutionary characteristics. different phosphatases interact with various types of proteins and enzymes in various biological processes and metabolic pathways. in order to identify important protein interactions involving the parasite phosphatases, we performed string   <cit>  and plasmomap analysis .  <cit>  for the string analysis, we used default parameters . string analysis of the  <dig> phosphatase sequences helped identification of interacting partners for  <dig> phosphatase sequences . plasmomap analysis revealed interaction partners for  <dig> phosphatases overlapped string predictions . amongst these, the phosphatases corresponding to pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig> have few common predicted interacting partners, increasing the chances of correct predictions by consensus. this interacting partner prediction analysis revealed that majority of the phosphatases are linked directly or indirectly through common targets.

in the following sections, we discuss the in silico data analysis of p. falciparum phosphatases present in each superfamily as well as their predicted interacting partners.

mpp group – metallophosphatases
mpp , also known as metallophosphoestrases, phosphodiesterases, binuclear metallophosphoestrases and dimetal-containing phosphoestrases, represent a diverse superfamily of enzymes with a conserved domain containing an active site consisting of two metal ions  coordinated with octahedral geometry by a cage of histidine, asparagines and aspartate residues. this superfamily includes phospho-protein phosphatases , mre11/sbcd-like exonucleases, dbr1-like rna lariat debranching enzymes, yfce-like phosphodiesterases, purple acid phosphatases , ybbf-like udp- <dig> -diacylglucosamine hydrolases, and acid sphingomyelinases . classically enzymes belonging to metallophosphatases have been clustered into  <dig> major groups: pp <dig>  pp2a and pp2b, on the basis of substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity  <cit> . this classification has been extended with the identification of a range of sequences related to metallophosphatases, but distinct from the  <dig> classified groups due to early divergence from the other protein phosphatases in the evolutionary history of eukaryotes  <cit> . thus ppps can be clustered into eight distinct subtypes of serine/threonine phosphatases: pp <dig>  pp2a, pp2b, pp <dig>  pp <dig>  pp <dig>  pp <dig>  and plant specific bsu superfamily, characterized by the presence of kelch motif  <cit> . pp <dig>  pp <dig> and pp <dig> are closely related to each other as compared with other ppps  <cit> . furthermore, a family of bacterial like ppp sequences  is present in p. falciparum <cit> . three highly conserved motifs  mediating metal ion coordination in the active centre are considered as signature of metallophosphatase family, however sequences without gdxhg or gdxxdrg motif have also been identified in plants, plasmodium and few fungi species  <cit> .

previously  <dig> mpp catalytic domains were reported by wilkes and doerig  <cit> . we have included  <dig> additional sequences  into the mpp superfamily. in this study, we identified  <dig> candidate proteins with catalytic domains conforming to metallophosphatases. multiple sequence alignment of the  <dig> sequences along with the sequences of other species cited above was performed and a neighbour joining phylogenetic tree was generated. annotations associated with these sequences indicate that the group mainly contains serine/theronine phosphatase sequences; and also sequences whose substrate is not a phosphoprotein. we further sub-grouped the metallophosphatases on the basis of different metallophosphatase domains and studied them in detail.

pp1: pf3d7_ <dig> has been identified as pp <dig> type phosphatases. analysis of pp <dig> inhibition has shown that the pp <dig> is responsible for a majority of protein phosphatase activity in p. falciparum. plasmomap interacting partner prediction analysis shows that this phosphatase may play very important role in parasite growth; being linked with the chromosome condensation protein, minchromosome maintenance  complex subunit , cdc2-like protein kinase, anaphase-promoting complex subunit, replication licensing factor, dna replication licensing factor mcm <dig>  dna replication licensing factor mcm <dig> and others. pp <dig> is also predicted to interact with udp-galactose transporter, chromatin assembly protein , and choline kinase. string database analysis shows that pp <dig> interacts with pfn conserved proteins essential for the invasive blood stages of the parasite. blisnick et al. have shown that pp <dig> plays an important role in the release of infectious merozoites  <cit> . experimental evidences show that pflrr <dig>  <cit>  and pp <dig> regulators  inhibit pp <dig> catalytic activity  <cit> . pp <dig> is able to functionally complement a glc <dig>  mutation in s. cerevisiae <cit> . inhibition activity using pp <dig> specific inhibitors i- <dig> and i- <dig> shows that pp <dig> is required for the erythrocyte reinvasion but might be dispensable for schizont maturation. pp <dig> depletion analysis using sirna, showed inhibition of cell cycle progression in all erythrocytic stages  <cit> . it is also constitutively expressed  <cit>  as shown by mass spectroscopic studies  <cit> .

ppkl: pf3d7_ <dig> has been identified as a ppkl phosphatase and shows higher structural similarity to pp <dig> as compared to other metallophosphatases. it has  <dig> short inserts in its catalytic domain and a long unique n terminal domain. the n terminal domain of the protein is composed of tandem kelch like repeats  <cit> . another important feature of ppkl is pro to thr substitution in the conserved sapny motif and the absence of sequence similarity in the b12-b <dig> okadaic acid-binding loop. the ppkl gene structure is conserved in homologous sequences from the apicomplexan organisms reported by wilkes et al. , as well as in the a. thaliana, with  <dig> ppkl sequences  <cit> . kelch motifs form distinctive ‘propeller like’ tertiary structures proposed to mediate interactions with regulatory subunits  <cit> . bsu <dig>  an a. thaliana ppkl is a nucleus localized protein studied in detail and appears to be involved in regulating signals from the brassinosteroid plant hormones  <cit> . the limited distribution of ppkls  is reminiscent with that of other gene families and is in line with the proposed photosynthetic ancestry of apicomplexa  <cit> . recent publications on ppkl have shown that it plays an important role in ookinetes morphology, motility and invasion  <cit> . pf3d7_ <dig> also contain mpp_bsu <dig> catalytic domain but lacks kelch like motif in the n-terminal region. string database analysis indicates that this phosphatase may interact with the various vacuolar proteins. it is also predicted to interact with cysteine proteinase falcipain, which plays important role in haemoglobin degradation, an essential process for parasite survival.

pp2a, pp <dig>  and pp6: pf3d7_ <dig> was assigned to pp2a group of protein phosphatases  <cit> . pp2a  is a critical regulator of many cellular activities, and comprises about 1% of total parasite cellular proteins. pp2a, together with protein phosphatase  <dig> , accounts for more than 90% of all serine/threonine phosphatase activities in most cells and tissues. interacting partner prediction analysis indicates that it interacts with a wide range of proteins and enzymes like phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator, hsp70/hsp <dig> organizing protein , trna m5c-methyltransferase, mrna-decapping enzyme  <dig> , and actin-like protein. vandomme et al. reported that phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator binds and activates pfpp2a  <cit> . string database analysis identifies interacting partners similar as of ppkl phosphatase; this similarity might be because of the high similarity of ppkl catalytic subunit with pp <dig> catalytic domain. the pp2a subunits, in addition to having a catalytic domain homologous to pp <dig> has a unique c-terminal tail, containing a motif that is conserved in the catalytic subunits of all pp2a-like phosphatases including pp <dig> and pp <dig>  and plays an important role in pp2a regulation. the pp2a-like family of phosphatases share a similar heterotrimeric architecture, that includes: a 65 kda scaffolding subunit a , a 36 kda catalytic subunit , and one of the  <dig> regulatory subunits   <cit> . mass spectroscopic evidences show that pf3d7_ <dig> is expressed in asexual stages as well as in gametocytes. pf3d7_ <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig>   <cit>  characterized to this group, show protein expression limited to schizont stage only . plasmomap prediction for pf3d7_ <dig> shows that it may play an important role in replication phase of parasite cycle; as it is predicted to interact with almost every enzyme/proteins to which pp <dig> and ppkl phosphatases interact.

pp2b: pf3d7_ <dig> is a pp2b/pp3/calcineurin, a unique serine/threonine protein phosphatase with regulatory domains comprising of an auto-inhibitory region and sites of interaction with  <dig> ca2+ binding proteins, calcineurin b and calmodulin, in addition to its catalytic domain  <cit> . these two confer ca2+ dependent regulation of pp2b phosphatase activity. cyclosporin a/cyclophilin acts as inhibitor for pp2b enzymes  <cit> . singh et al. showed that treatment of merozoites with calcineurin inhibitors limits the growth p. falciparum blood stage parasite  <cit> . plasmomap interaction partner predictions showed that it interacts with camp, cgmp and calmodulin domain kinases as well as ser/thr protein kinases. plasmomap also predicts its interaction with the zinc finger protein, actin and protein phosphatase 2b regulatory subunit, regulating the phosphatase activity. pp2b is highly conserved from yeast to human’s genomes, however it is absent in the plants.

pp5: pf3d7_ <dig>  a c-terminal metallophosphatase domain identified in serine/threonine protein phosphatase- <dig>  is a member of the ppp gene family of protein phosphatases, highly conserved among eukaryotes and widely expressed in mammalian tissues. pp <dig> has a c-terminal phosphatase domain and an extended n-terminal tpr  domain  <cit> . tpr domains typically contain  <dig> amino acids with a consensus sequence -x---x--x--x--x--x-. it has an auto-inhibitory effect on the phosphatase activity of pf3d7_ <dig>  in other system this inhibition is overcome by binding unsaturated fatty acids  <cit> . dobson et al. had shown that pp <dig> interacts with pfhsp <dig>  <cit> . plasmomap predicts that pf3d7_ <dig> protein interacts with a variety of enzymes and regulatory subunits of proteins ranging from eukaryotic translation initiation factor, lysine-trna ligase, erythrocyte membrane-associated antigen, heat shock protein  <dig>  adp/atp transporter on adenylate translocase, rna helicase and several others indicating it may be essential phosphatase required for parasite growth and development.

pp7/ppef: pf3d7_ <dig> protein phosphatase is regulated by ca2+ via the c-terminal ef-hand motifs and a calmodulin binding site in the n-terminal domain  <cit> . it has been described previously as pfppj containing only phosphatase domain  <cit> . the phosphatase activity is okadaic acid-resistant, and catalysis requires mn2+, and not any other cation like mg2+ or ca2+ <cit> . subsequent analysis demonstrated the primary pf3d7_ <dig> translation product to be much larger than the pp catalytic domain, with two ef-hand motifs that must be occupied by ca2+ for the enzyme to become fully active  <cit> . the small size originally predicted for pfppj was due to a spurious stop codon in the original cdna  <cit> , but a fragment corresponding to this size is apparently produced by post-translational processing, detected by western blotting. despite the presence of calmodulin binding motif in n-terminal domain, recombinant pfpp <dig> expressed in e. coli is insensitive to calmodulin, but is stimulated by the presence of motifs in c-terminal domain; and its activity is regulated by auto-inhibition by ca2+ binding  <cit> . string database analysis shows its co-expression with camp dependent protein kinase, rhoptry protein, merozoites surface protein and others showing it may play a vital role in parasitic growth and its invasion process.

shelphs: pf3d7_ <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig> belongs to shewanella-like phosphatases  <cit> . the characteristic feature of these phosphatases is the absence of sapny motif and the presence of another motif,  d g, which may alter their substrate preference from ser/thr to broad or even tyr specific  <cit> . pf3d7_ <dig> is involved in microneme development in plasmodium ookinetes development and parasite transmission  <cit> . pf3d7_ <dig>  and pf3d7_ <dig>  are characterized by n-terminal signal sequences. pf3d7_ <dig> possess an additional apicoplast targeted motif . pf3d7_ <dig> has been likely to be involved in invasion of merozoites stage  <cit> . string database analysis reveals that pf3d7_ <dig> interacts with myosin d, actin-depolymerising factor, calcium-dependent protein kinase  <dig> and erythrocyte membrane protein. mass spectroscopic evidence shows that the two proteins of this group are expressed in all the p. falciparum developmental stages.

acp5: the p. falciparum proteins pf3d7_ <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig> belong to the mpp_acp <dig> family. acid phosphatase  <dig>  removes the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker from lysosomal proteins  <cit> . the exact site of dephosphorylation is not clear; however evidences suggest that dephosphorylation may take place in a pre-lysosomal compartment as well as in lysosome. pf3d7_ <dig> is a glideosome associated protein  <dig>  secreted acid phosphatase, with fully active acp <dig> catalytic unit and annotated to be involved in protein anchoring  <cit> . recent publications using gfp-fused pfgap <dig> have confirmed the localization of pfgap <dig> in the inner membrane complex of p. falciparum <cit> . muller et al. had shown that secretion of gap <dig> acid phosphatase provides a possible mechanism to acquire host nutrients by p. falciparum <cit> . pf3d7_ <dig> shows elaborate structural similarity to pf3d7_ <dig>  string database analysis shows its interaction with gap <dig> acid phosphatase on the basis of binding evidences.

vps29: vps <dig> superfamily protein pf3d7_ <dig> is characterized by a vacuolar sorting protein  <dig> domain, also known as vacuolar membrane protein pep <dig>  a subunit of the retromer complex which is responsible for the retrieval of mannose-6-phosphate receptors  from the endosomes for retrograde transport back to the golgi . vps <dig> consist of a phosphoestrase fold which acts as a protein interaction scaffold for retromer complex assembly as well as a phosphatase with specificity for the cytoplasmic tail of the mpr  <cit> . the retromer includes the following  <dig> subunits: vps <dig>  vps <dig>  vps <dig>  and a dimer of the sorting nexins vps <dig> , and vps <dig> . string database analysis shows that it interacts with the other vacuolar proteins like vps <dig> and vps <dig>  the protein is also predicted to interact with vacuolar atp synthase subunit f, vacuolar atp synthase subunit d - beta  <dig>  and proteasome subunit as well as 20s beta- <dig> proteasome subunit. it is shown in human that vps <dig> binds with vps <dig> and vps <dig> to perform biological functions by participating in the formation of retromer complexes  <cit> .

mpp_dbr1: pf3d7_ <dig> belongs to mpp_dbr <dig> group of metallophosphatases. dbr <dig> is an rna lariat debranching enzyme that hydrolyzes 2′-5′ phosphodiester bonds at the branch points of excised intron lariats  <cit> . severe growth defect occurs in a schizosaccharomyces pombe mutant defective in intron lariat degradation  <cit> , which is also true for human rna lariat debranching enzyme  <cit> . structure-function analysis of yeast rna debranching enzyme  shows that it is a manganese-dependent phosphodiesterases enzyme  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, there is no published work related to the p. falciparum phosphatase.

mpp_phod: pf3d7_ <dig> consists of mpp_phod domain. phod phosphatase also known as alkaline phosphatase d/apased in bacillus subtilis, is a secreted phosphodiesterases encoded by phod of the pho regulon in bacillus subtilis <cit> . its homologs are found in prokaryotes, eukaryotes and archaea. it contains a twin arginine  motif and transported by the tat  translocation pathway machinery   <cit> . string database analysis shows its interaction with gtp cyclohydrolase i and 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase.

mpp_mre: mre <dig>  is a subunit of the mrx  protein complex. this complex includes: mre <dig>  rad <dig>  and xrs2/nbs <dig>  and plays a vital role in several nuclear processes including dna double-strand break repair, telomere length maintenance, cell cycle checkpoint control, and meiotic recombination in eukaryotes  <cit> . during double-strand break repair, the mrx complex is required to hold the two ends of a broken chromosome together. in vitro studies show that mre <dig> has 3′-5′ exonuclease activity on dsdna templates and endonuclease activity on dsdna and ssdna templates . in addition to the n-terminal phosphatase domain, the eukaryotic mre <dig> members of this superfamily have a c-terminal dna binding domain. mre11-like proteins are found in prokaryotes, archaea as well as in eukaryotes. pf3d7_ <dig> consists of  <dig> incomplete but catalytically active mpp_mre <dig> domains.

mpp_cstp1: pf3d7_ <dig> consists of complete s-transactivated protein  <dig>  domain. cstp <dig> domain is similar to h. sapiens protein with a metallophosphatase domain, which is transactivated by the complete s protein of hepatitis b virus. string database analysis shows its interaction with other p. falciparum phosphatases.

pp2cc group
protein phosphatase 2c is a mn2+ and mg2+ dependent protein serine/theronine phosphatases. the active form of the protein appears as highly diverse monomeric polypeptides, which in many cases possess regulatory domain in c- or n-terminal extension. the protein architecture and deduced catalytic mechanism of pp2cc group of phosphatases are similar to pp <dig>  pp2a, and pp2b family of ser/thr phosphatases, despite low sequence similarity  <cit> . this group of phosphatases are greatly expanded in plants  <cit>  and are involved in modulating stress responses  <cit> .

eleven pp2cc phosphatase sequences identified in p. falciparum, together with those from the other organism cited above were subjected to the multiple sequence alignment and neighbour joining phylogenetic tree construction. annotations associated with these sequences indicate that this group mainly contains serine/theronine phosphatase class proteins. interestingly several phosphatases of this group do not have human ortholog  . pf3d7_ <dig> is a new inclusion to this group with unknown function.

pf3d7_ <dig> is the only pp2cc characterized in the parasite  <cit> . it has been implicated in regulation of the translation elongation factor 1b, antagonising its in vitro phosphorylation by mammalian protein kinase c  <cit> . as compared to other pp2cc phosphatases, pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig> exhibit  <dig> distinct pp2cc domains which may be interacting with each other forming two effective active sites as shown by mamoun et al. for pf3d7_ <dig>  <cit> . pf3d7_ <dig> polypeptide has two distinct pp2cc type domain, each capable of enzymatic activity  <cit> . they also concluded that dimerization of pfpp2c  is required for the optimal enzymatic activity  <cit> .

ptp group
protein tyrosine phosphatases  group can be divided into three main families; tyrosine specific phosphatases, dual specific phosphatases, and low molecular weight phosphatases  <cit> . the dual specific phosphatases include cdc25-like, cdc <dig> and mapk phosphatases . the tyrosine and dual specific phosphatases are involved in signalling cell growth, differentiation and cell cycle progression control. cdc <dig> is a major regulator of cyclin dependent kinases  <cit>  and cdc <dig> regulates mitosis exit by dephosphorylating cdk targets  <cit> . the enzyme shares a common catalytic mechanism mediated by cysteine, arginine and aspartic acid residues. the protein family has a distinctive active site signature motif,  hcxxgxxrs, which harbours the catalytic cysteinyl residue and mutation of cysteine residue, abolishes the catalytic activities of ptps  <cit> .

the  <dig> catalytic domains conforming to ptpc were identified in p. falciparum, together with those from the other organisms cited above were subjected to the multiple sequence alignment and neighbour joining phylogenetic tree construction. conserved domain analysis characterizes pf3d7_ <dig>  and pf3d7_ <dig> into dual specific phosphatases  as reported previously  <cit> . these dsps acts on phospho  as well as on phosphotyrosine; and plays important adaptive role in eukaryotic cells in response to extra or intra cellular stimuli. two of the p. falciparum ptps  have been biochemically analysed  <cit> . pf3d7_ <dig> belongs to prl  group  <cit>  and detected in the extracellular supernatant of infected rbcs  <cit> . this sequence possesses the caax c-terminal motif for farnesylation, a distinguishing feature of this group of phosphatases. it was demonstrated that this motif in pf3d7_ <dig> is target of farnesyl transferase activity purified from parasite extracts. the purified protein from parasite extracts and recombinant pf3d7_ <dig> displays phosphatase activity  <cit> . in p. falciparum merozoites, it co localizes with ama- <dig>  a membrane associated protein associated with invasion  <cit> . plasmomap analysis for interacting partners of pf3d7_ <dig> shows that it may be involved in regulation of translation process. it interacts with eukaryotic translation initiation factor- <dig> subunit  <dig>  60s ribosomal protein l <dig>  eukaryotic translation initiation factor eif2a, myb <dig> protein, pre-mrna-splicing factor isy <dig> homolog, proliferation-associated protein 2 g <dig> and several other proteins . pf3d7_ <dig> have incomplete ptp motif and it probably does not contain any catalytic active region for protein phosphatase activity. pf3d7_ <dig> contains both active site and active residues to perform phosphatase activity, however no literature is available for this phosphatase.

the characteristic feature of this group is that the conserved catalytic core of its domain contains a his residue, which is phosphorylated in the reaction along with two key arg residues. an additional his residue is hydrogen bonded to the phospho group before, during and after transfer  <cit> . this set of proteins includes cofactor-dependent and cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutases , fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase ase, sts- <dig>  sixa, histidine acid phosphatases, and phytases. hp superfamily proteins play functional role in metabolism, signalling and regulation, for example f26bpase affects glycolysis and gluconeogenesis through controlling the concentration of f26bp.

cdd search of p. falciparum proteome yielded  <dig> hp superfamily hits, predicted to be involved in glycolysis pathway. genetic characterization of pf3d7_ <dig>  homolog in rodent parasite p. berghei indicates that pf3d7_ <dig> may be essential for blood stage asexual growth and zygote ookinetes development  <cit> . their experiments show that pfpgm <dig> has a prominent phosphatase activity in contrast to weak mutase activity and it acts as an enzyme in phosphate metabolism or regulator of parasite life cycle. string database analysis shows the interaction of this phosphatase with the proteins/enzymes involved in glycolysis pathway like enolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, pf3d7_ <dig> and others. pf3d7_ <dig> consists of an additional domain atp-grasp_ <dig> 

had – haloacid dehalogenase like superfamily
haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolases  includes l-2-haloacid dehalogenase, epoxide hydrolase, phosphoserine phosphatase, phosphomannomutase, phosphoglycolate phosphatase, and p-type atpase  <cit>  <cit> . these proteins catalyze nucleophilic substitution reactions at phosphorus or carbon centers, using a conserved asp carboxylate in covalent catalysis. all members possess a conserved alpha/beta core domain, and most of the proteins also possess a small cap domain, with varying folds and functions. members of this superfamily contain dxdx  motif, hence members of this group belong to the dddd superfamily of phosphohydrolases  <cit> .

cdd search of p. falciparum proteome revealed  <dig> had_like superfamily domain hits. similar to the p. falciparum pp2cc superfamily proteins, it mainly contains putative phosphatases , one with conserved plasmodium sequence with unknown function, and 50% identified to this group do not show ortholog in humans . had superfamily consists of proteins belonging to nif , with active dxdx  and brct domain  of fcp <dig> phosphatases.

pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig>  and pf3d7_ <dig> are previously reported plasmodium proteins of this superfamily  <cit> . pf3d7_ <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig> may possess phosphatase activity due to the presence of proper dxdx  motif. pf3d7_ <dig> has dxdx  motif, but it is not present in catalytic active domain region. it was also reported that pf3d7_ <dig> lacks the dxdx  motif  <cit>  suggesting it may be catalytically inactive. pf3d7_ <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig> possess the brct domain assigned to fcp <dig> phosphatases. pf3d7_ <dig> lacks brct domain and hence related to scp type phosphatases  <cit> . string database analysis predicts that pf3d7_ <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig> are probably involved in the transcription process as they interact with enzymes or proteins involved in transcription mainly rna polymerase. pf3d7_ <dig> contains several disrupted partial dxdx  motifs, having only dxdx part of the active motif, suggesting it may be inactive and may not possess phosphatase activity. cdd results also show the absence of catalytically active site in pf3d7_ <dig>  gene ontology analysis predicts its involvement in protein binding. other than the four, all the other members of this superfamily are new inclusions to the had_like superfamily.

pf3d7_ <dig>  a bifunctional polynucleotide phosphatase/kinases  enzyme consists of a proximal 5′-kinase module with an essential p-loop motif, gxgk and a distal 3′-phosphatase module with an essential acyl-phosphatase motif, dx- dxt. hence pnkp is able to perform phosphorylation as well as dephosphorylation. siribal et al. characterized pnkp enzyme and detected phosphatase activity  <cit> . pf3d7_ <dig> also contains two pnkp domains, however only the first containing the active domain region.

pf3d7_ <dig> is a 4-nitrophenylphosphatase, which probably interacts with many cellular proteins involving succinate dehydrogenase, cytidine triphosphate synthetase, asparagine synthetase, gtpases, rna binding protein, trna synthetase, ribosomal proteins and many more involved in transcription regulation and related cellular functions .

eep superfamily
exonuclease/endonuclease-phosphatase possess diverse catalytic domain of different proteins including the exoiii family of apurinic/apyrimidinic  endonucleases, inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases , neutral sphingomyelinases , deadenylases , bacterial cytolethal distending toxin b  and deoxyribonuclease  <dig> . these diverse enzymes share a common catalytic mechanism of cleaving phosphodiester bonds containing substrates  <cit> .

plasmodb and cdd analysis revealed  <dig> hits in this superfamily, all annotated with putative functions. out of the eight in eep superfamily parasite proteins, six do not have any human ortholog. pf3d7_ <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig> have additional inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase  domains. inpp5c phosphatases are mg2+ dependent and hydrolyze the 5-phosphate from the inositol ring of various 5-position phosphorylated phosphoinositides  as well as inositol phosphatases. pf3d7_ <dig>  in addition to eep domain, consists of syja_n superfamily domain too. pf3d7_ <dig> blast results showed that sequences similar to it are 2′ <dig> - phosphodiesterases. pfd7_ <dig> is annotated as sphingomyelin phosphodiesterases in plasmodb database. string database analysis reveals its possible interactions with camp-specific 3′,5′-cyclic phosphodiesterases 4d, merozoite surface protein  <dig>  actins , rhoptry associated protein  <dig> , gap <dig> and diacylglycerol kinases based on co-expression profile showing that pf3d7_ <dig> may play important role in parasite development and its growth. other members of this group pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig> have been assigned to this group on the basis of presence of conserved eep domain.

pap2_like group
pap2_like proteins are a superfamily of histidine phosphatases and vanadium haloperoxidases. the super-family includes type  <dig> phosphatidic acid phosphatases, lipid phosphate phosphatases, glucose-6-phosphatases, bacterial acid phosphatases, and phosphatidylglycerophosphatase. members of this group of proteins harbouring conserved phosphatase motif kxxxxxxrp--psgh--srxxxxxhxxxd  <cit> , are predicted to be transmembrane proteins.

two pap2_like phosphatase sequences  are predicted to be phosphatidic acid phosphatase having transmembrane domain. pf3d7_ <dig>  and pf3d7_ <dig>  have similar amino acid sequence in the conserved domain region with 100% , but pf3d7_ <dig>  consists of an additional  <dig> amino acid in its non-conserved domain region. it could be due to an incorrect exon/intron prediction or alternate splicing. active conserved pap <dig> phosphatase motif is present only in pf3d7_ <dig> while pf3d7_ <dig> /pf3d7_ <dig>  contains incomplete phosphatase motif.

nucleoside phosphatase group
this group includes nbd_sugar-kinase_hsp_actin and gda1_cd <dig> domain containing phosphatases. nbd_sugar-kinase_hsp_actin group includes actin family, hsp <dig> family of molecular chaperons and nucleotide exchange factors; hexokinase family and exopolyphosphatase/nucleoside triphosphatase. the nucleotide binding site residues are conserved and the nucleotide sites in a deep cleft are formed between the two lobes of the nucleotide binding domain. substrate binding to group members is associated with the closure of the catalytic cleft.

cdd classifies two phosphatases pf3d7_ <dig>  and pf3d7_ <dig>  to this superfamily. gda1_cd <dig> phosphatase domain is present in both phosphatases, whereas nbd_sugar-kinase_hsp_actin is present only in pf3d7_ <dig>  string results show that apyrase interacts with proteins/enzymes involved in dna replication, dna repair as well as in pre-mrna splicing. adenosine diphosphatase string database analysis shows that it interacts with chromosome condensation protein, peptidase, and cysteine-rich surface protein. protein expression profile also suggests that it is expressed throughout all the stages of malaria parasite, making it a suitable target for antimalarial drug target.

rhod group
rhodanese homology domain is an alpha beta fold domain found duplicated in the rhodanese protein. the cysteine containing enzymatically active form  is also present in cdc <dig> class of protein phosphatases. cdc <dig> plays an important role in cell cycle  <cit> . cdd search reported  <dig> phosphatase sequences; pf3d7_ <dig>  and pf3d7_ <dig>  containing rhod  domain, none of them with cx5r motif. cdd predicts the presence of catalytic active residue in rhod domain present in both phosphatases. string database analysis shows that these phosphatases may be involved in interaction with 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase and nli interacting factor-like phosphatase. recently pf3d7_ <dig> has been shown as a mapk phosphatase playing an essential role in the life cycle and development of p. falciparum <cit> .

ptpla group
ptpla group is different from the protein tyrosine phosphatases due to the presence of a proline instead of arginine at the catalytically active site, therefore it is referred as protein tyrosine like protein and the mutation renders its catalytic activity  <cit> . it is predicted to be involved in the development, differentiation, and maintenance of number of tissue types . the presence of ptpls in distant eukaryotic lineages strongly suggest important role they play in eukaryotes  <cit> . ptpl represent one of the several examples of phosphatases that have lost their enzymatic activity and are involved in other functions.

pf3d7_ <dig> contains a ptpla domain. similar to other protozoan ptpls, pf3d7_ <dig> have either er  retention signal  or a similar c-terminal sequence enriched in basic amino acids  <cit> . it consist of highly positively charged n-terminus; however this predicted structure could not be verified using ests and not found conserved in other plasmodium species, suggesting it may be a case of incorrect exon prediction  belonging to inositol phosphatases, were identified in p. falciparum proteome. this family represents a protein domain, which shows homology to the yeast protein saci. string database analysis shows that pf3d7_ <dig> interacts with 2-oxoglutarate/malate translocator protein, p-type atpase, acyl coa binding protein and beta-hydroxyacyl-acp dehydratase precursor. it is also predicted to interact with the mitochondrial inner membrane translocase. string did not predict any interaction partner for pf3d7_ <dig> 

cyth_like phosphatases group
cyth group also known as triphosphate tunnel metaloenzyme hydrolyzes the triphosphate containing substrates and requires metal cation cofactors. pf3d7_ <dig>  a rna triphosphatase belongs to cyth-like_pase group and is predicted to be involved in polynucleotide 5′-phosphatase activity, protein binding and mrna capping process  <cit> .

pth <dig> group
peptidyl-trna hydrolase, type  <dig> causes release of trna from the premature translation product peptidyl trna. pth group is present in bacteria and eukaryotes, whereas the same function is performed by pth <dig> in archaea and eukaryotes. pth and pth <dig> are structurally different enzymes. cdd search revealed one pth2_family domain hit . the protein is predicted to be involved in protein tyrosine phosphatase and protein dephosphorylation activity  <cit> . string predicts it to be involved in the activity of u <dig> snrna-associated sm like protein and dna directed rna polymerases.

additional functional characterizations
since good quality protein data bank  experimental structures and homology-based models could be used for in-silico screening experiments for finding novel drug leads, we set out to explore available plasmodium phosphatase structures and possibility of generating reliable molecular models of the proteins for which experimental structures are unavailable. a plasmodb search identified  <dig> structures of phosphatases, out of which  <dig> are experimental structures . ncbi pdb sequence blast helped in identification of  <dig> phosphatases with more than 40% similarity to suitable templates . homology based modelling could be performed only on  <dig> malarial phosphatases, with conserved domain region present in the models  while the remaining  <dig> do not contain conserved domain region in the homology based models, especially in the cases where query sequence similarity with the template is poor.

stage specific and sub-cellular distribution of p. falciparumphosphatases
we analysed the protein expression profile  of the identified plasmodium phosphatases to understand their distribution in different stages of p. falciparum life cycle . protein expression profile shows that schizont and gametocytes stages share  <dig> common phosphatases. fourteen phosphatases are common in schizont, ring and trophozoite stages. four phosphatases are expressed only in gametocytes, whereas  <dig> in schizont stage alone.figure  <dig>

sub-cellular localization prediction yielded  <dig> phosphatase family proteins, namely- pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig>  targeted to apicoplast  <cit> . mitoprot  <cit>   and plasmit algorithm  <cit>   were used to predict mitochondrial targeted genes. consensus predictions of mitoprot  and plasmit algorithm  for mitochondrial-targeted sequences include pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig> 

gene ontology and ortholog group analysis
gene ontology analysis revealed that  <dig> of the p. falciparum phosphatases are probably involved in phosphatase like activity; out of which,  <dig> are indicated to have serine/theronine phosphatase activity. eleven phosphatases perform hydrolase function. the study further showed that  <dig> annotated protein phosphatases are directly involved in dephosphorylation process. the two phosphatases; pf3d7_ <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig>  perform both protein phosphorylation as well as dephosphorylation process. the present study thus reveals that plasmodium phosphatases are involved in a wide range of processes and functions. figure 5a and b show the diagrammatic representation of p. falciparum phosphatases involved in various molecular functions and biological processes based on gene ontology function.figure  <dig>

orthomcl analysis of p. falciparum phosphatases shows presence of  <dig> phosphatase sequences for which no human orthologs are present and out of this,  <dig> are plasmodium specific. these  <dig> phosphatases are grouped into the following phosphatase super-families;  <dig> in pp2cc,  <dig> in mpp,  <dig> in eep ,  <dig> in had,  <dig> in hp and pap <dig>   <dig> in ptpc, rhod and cyth superfamily.

phylogenetic analysis
we performed phylogenetic analysis for the major groups present in p. falciparum and the selected model organisms. clustalx  <dig>  <cit>  and muscle  <cit>  were used to perform protein sequence multiple sequence alignments and mega  <dig>   <cit>  was used to perform phylogenetic analysis. phylogenetic analysis performed on  <dig> p. falciparum phosphatase superfamily sequences with the model organism cited above validates the orthomcl classification. figure  <dig> shows phylogenetic tree for mpp domain superfamily proteins studied here. phylogenetic tree for other super-families are presented in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  phylogenetic trees in general show clustering of p. falciparum phosphatases with the apicomplexans as well as with the non-apicomplexans orthologs, however the phylogenetic trees for each of the known phosphatase super families reveal a considerable phylogenetic closeness amongst apicomplexan organisms and considerable phylogenetic distance with the other eukaryotic model organisms. for few cases our analysis does not show all the orthologs classified by orthomcl database due to the fact that we retrieved only the referenced and reviewed non-apicomplexan phosphatase sequences from uniprot. phylogenetic analysis of mpp superfamily shows clustering of phosphatases into distinct groups, according to different metallophosphatase subgroups, namely pp <dig>  ppkl, pp2b, pp <dig>  shelphs and others. this indicates the conservation of metallophosphatase superfamily during the course of evolution across various lineages. pp2b absent in plants hence, a. thaliana sequence is missing in the pp2b phylogenetic tree. ptpc superfamily phylogenetic shows two dual specific phosphatases, pf3d7_ <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig> clustered together. interestingly, pf3d7_ <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig> have human orthologs q9uni <dig> and q <dig>  respectively. similarly, the other two ptpc phosphatases cluster together. phylogenetic tree of hp superfamily reveals that  <dig> p. falciparum phosphatases have orthologs in all the apicomplexans. phosphatases belonging to h. sapiens and s. cerevisiae form separate clusters in hp superfamily. few of the phosphatases perform different function other than histidine acid phosphatase or phosphoglycerate mutase and might have lost phosphatase function during course of evolution, however due to sequence similarity and the presence of hp conserved domain, we classified them into this superfamily  <cit> . phosphatases belonging to eep  domain also get clustered in phylogenetic tree according to the gene ontology function predicted or annotated for them. eep phosphatases are clustered according to their functional group of inositol phosphatase, ccr <dig>  or nuclease family. in pp2cc and had superfamilies, the phylogenetic analysis shows that in general apicomplexan organism are clustered together on the basis of their orthologies. the h. sapiens, s. cerevisiae, t. gondii, a. thaliana and e. coli  phosphatases form separate cluster in both the super-families. t. gondii have higher number of phosphatases as compared to other apicomplexans studied here, forms separate cluster in pp2cc phylogenetic tree. phylogenetic tree shows presence of one syja_n p. falciparum phosphatase sequences, pf3d7_ <dig>  in all the apicomplexans studied here. phylogenetic tree shows that two human and three s. cerevisiae phosphatases may have relatedness with pf3d7_ <dig>  but there is no orthomcl evidence to support this. this group is absent in e. coli and although orthomcl predicts a. thaliana ortholog, we could not get any phosphatase related to a. thaliana because strict sequence collection procedure adopted by us. orthomcl analysis of pap <dig> superfamily phosphatases show absence of human orthologs, phylogenetic tree reveals some similarity with human phosphatases although sequence similarity is low to conclude such relatedness of parasite phosphatase with the host. phosphatases belonging to rhod superfamily can be grouped into two clusters; cell cycle control phosphatase cdc <dig> and mkp <dig>  and its ortholog is present in all the model organisms except e. coli. for nucleoside phosphatase subfamily, all the plasmodium species contain one phosphatase each except p. falciparum, which has two phosphatases belonging to this group. pf3d7_ <dig> clusters with t. gondii phosphatase , which is greatly expanded in t. gondii as compared to other apicomplexans studied here. cyth superfamily phosphatase is present in most of the apicomplexans studied and s. cerevisiae. ptpla phosphatases are present in all model organism studied here, except e.coli, t. parva and s. cerevisiae. there is one ptpla phosphatase in all the apicomplexans and a. thaliana, however four in h. sapiens. amongst all the model organisms studied here, p. falciparum, p. berghei, p. chabaudi, and p. knowlesi and h. sapiens have single pth <dig> phosphatase protein, whereas t. parva and c. parvam have  <dig> each. the phylogenetic tree analysis also reveals that human phosphatases shows great expansion in ptp group whereas a. thaliana shows clustered expansion in mpp and pp2cc superfamily.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have closely re-examined and classified various plasmodium phosphatase family proteins based on a broader selection criteria such as diverse substrates, apart from conserved phosphatase protein family motifs. phosphatases can have different substrates- ranging from proteins to non-proteins, for example substrates for the parasite phosphatases: pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig> are protein, rna and carbohydrates, respectively. orthomcl analysis showed that  <dig> p. falciparum phosphatase sequences have orthologs in human and  <dig> phosphatases are restricted to plasmodium species. p. falciparum phosphatase proteome and its interacting partner analysis thus provides useful insights about the stage specificity and cellular expression of plasmodium phosphatases. structures of three phosphatases are known and several others can be approximated, which will enhance our understanding of the molecular functions performed by parasite phosphatases. identification of six plasmodium specific phosphatases may be useful in identifying novel drug targets and also help in understanding their role in different parasite pathways.

although the analysis in this review is based on current annotations of the genomes included in the study, it is likely that most of the annotations will be final but there is still a chance that some annotations may change in future. prediction of phosphatase function for the candidate p. falciparum phosphatases is based on the cdd/pfam/blast/homolog results, which solely rely on the conserved sequence patterns present throughout the protein families in the evolutionary trees of the species. interacting partner prediction analysis of candidate phosphatases reveals its involvement in essential biological pathways necessary for the parasite survival. it might be possible that in p. falciparum, some of these identified putative proteins are inactive as phosphatases, but are still expressed  in the parasite and may be involved in different biological processes performing essential functions required for the parasite survival. although, we took all the precautions for the accuracy and completeness of initial identification, by using multiple strategies, final annotations of molecular functions and pathways involved requires experimental evidences.
