BACKGROUND
the salicylic acid  defense signaling pathway plays a crucial role in mediating induced defense responses, including systemic acquired resistance. in arabidopsis, the transcriptional coactivator npr <dig> plays a key role in regulating the sa signaling pathway  <cit> . rice has an npr <dig> counterpart, osnpr1/nh <dig> , which plays a major role in the resistance to blast and leaf blight diseases caused by the fungal pathogen magnaporthe oryzae and the bacterial pathogen xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae , respectively  <cit> . chemical inducers of defense known as 'plant activators’ can protect plants against various diseases by acting on the plant sa signaling pathway  <cit> . plant activators confer protection against a wide range of pathogens, and their 'priming effect’ alleviates the costs of defense reactions on plant growth  <cit> .

the wrky transcription factors  form a super family that is involved in various regulatory processes in plants. they function via binding to a cis-element known as the “w-box” that is present in the promoters of target genes  <cit> . several studies have highlighted the importance of wrky tfs in transcriptional reprogramming of plant responses to different invading pathogens in various plant species  <cit> . the wrky family has  <dig> members in rice  <cit> . of these, several have been implicated in defense responses related to the sa pathway, mostly based on experimental evidence from overexpression studies  <cit> . however, the precise functions of most wrky tfs remain unknown.

previously, we identified rice wrky <dig>  which is transcriptionally inducible by the plant activator benzothiadiazole   <cit> . wrky <dig> belongs to group iii of the wrky family  <cit>  and its closest arabidopsis homolog is atwrky <dig>  <cit> . wrky <dig> plays a crucial role in resistance to the important rice pathogens m. oryzae and xoo, and is induced by various plant activators  <cit> . in our previous studies, overexpression of wrky <dig> conferred extremely strong resistance to both m. oryzae and xoo <cit> . microscopic analyses demonstrated that the blast resistance in wrky45-overexpressing  rice is based on a two-layered mechanism: pre-invasive defense, which prevents the invasion of fungal hyphae into rice cells, and post-invasive defense, which accompanies hr cell death, whereas probenazole-treated rice plants showed only the post-invasive defense  <cit> . we have shown that wrky <dig> is regulated by ubiquitin-proteasome degradation, similar to arabidopsis npr <dig>  <cit> . we proposed that this regulation could play a role in suppressing unnecessary defense activation in the absence of pathogens  <cit> . recently, we reported that wrky <dig> also plays a role in blast resistance mediated by panicle blast  <dig>  a blast resistance gene with a coiled-coil nucleotide binding leucine-rich repeat structure, through a protein–protein interaction  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, npr <dig> plays a major role in the sa pathway by regulating more than 99% of sa/bth-regulated genes  <cit> , while npr1-independent pathway also operate during early phases of pathogen infection  <cit> . however, experimental evidence suggests that the sa pathway in rice differs from that in arabidopsis. based on the results of epistasis analyses, we proposed that the sa-signaling pathway in rice branches into wrky45-dependent and osnpr1-dependent sub-pathways as a consequence of evolutionary divergence between rice and arabidopsis  <cit> . arabidopsis npr <dig> equally regulates upregulation and downregulation of genes  <cit> , but the molecular events that are regulated downstream of wrky <dig> in rice are largely uncharacterized.

to elucidate the molecular basis of wrky45-dependent disease resistance, we analyzed wrky45-regulated gene expression using rice transformants in which wrky <dig> expression was knocked-down by rnai. then, we conducted further expression analyses of representative genes after chemical-induced wrky <dig> expression and m. oryzae infection. to validate the transcriptional cascade regulated by wrky <dig>  we also conducted trans-activation assays of tf genes.

RESULTS
identification of wrky45-dependent bth-responsive genes in rice
to identify wrky45-dependent bth-responsive genes that possibly play a role in bth-induced disease resistance, we performed global gene expression analysis in nipponbare  and two lines  of wrky45-kd rice plants using a rice oligo dna microarray covering  <dig>  genes. in a previous study, we showed that rice resistance to blast and leaf-blight diseases induced by plant activators was partially compromised in these wrky45-kd lines  <cit> . comparison of gene expression profiles between bth- and mock-treated nb with four biological replicate experiments, followed by analysis of variance , identified  <dig>  bth-responsive genes . two-way anova of differential expression with respect to treatment  and genotype  identified  <dig> genes as statistically significant wrky45-dependent bth-responsive genes [i.e., those with a q value <  <dig>  after applying false discovery rate  multiple testing correction  <cit> . among these  <dig> genes,  <dig> showed >2-fold changes between bth-treated nb and line # <dig> wrky45-kd plants. of these,  <dig> genes were also statistically significant wrky45-dependent bth-responsive genes  in line # <dig> wrky45-kd plants  <cit> . these  <dig> genes were defined as wrky45-dependent bth-responsive genes . of the wrky45-dependent bth-responsive genes,  <dig> genes  were upregulated in response to bth and only  <dig> genes were downregulated, consistent with our previous results indicating that wrky <dig> is a transcriptional activator  <cit> . we conducted quantitative rt-pcr  analyses to quantify transcript levels of several selected genes, some of which were further characterized as described below. the qrt-pcr results validated the results of the microarray analysis .

functional categories of wrky45-dependent bth-responsive genes
the genes identified as wrky45-dependent bth-responsive genes were functionally categorized . several genes encoding pathogenesis-related  proteins, such as chitinase, glucanase, and peroxidases, and those encoding leucine-rich-repeat-containing putative resistance  proteins were among them. recent studies of nonhost resistance in the powdery mildew fungus–arabidopsis pathosystem have identified some components  involved in pre-invasive resistance mechanisms  <cit> . interestingly, a gene encoding a pen3-like abc transporter , which was previously implicated in the abiotic stress response  <cit> , was wrky45-dependently upregulated. the wrky45-dependent genes also included many genes that are possibly involved in secondary metabolism, including those encoding cytochrome p <dig> . cytochrome p450s have been implicated in the biosynthesis of antimicrobial phytoalexins and metabolism of xenobiotics  <cit> , as well as plant hormones. udp-glucuronosyl/udp-glucosyltransferase  family proteins of family  <dig>  <cit>  have been implicated in glycosylation of secondary metabolites and hormones  <cit> . we found  <dig> genes encoding family  <dig> gts among the wrky45-dependent genes . one of these, salicylic acid glucosyltransferase , contributes to plant-activator-induced disease resistance  <cit> . orthologs of another wrky45-dependent family  <dig> gt gene  are pathogen-inducible in arabidopsis, and their mutants showed decreased resistance to p. syringae pv. tomato-avrrpm <dig> <cit> . the rice genome contains  <dig> genes encoding putative glutathione s-transferases , and  <dig> of them were wrky45-dependently upregulated . in addition to their antioxidant activity, gsts have a role in detoxifying toxins by conjugating glutathione to substrates. genes encoding allene oxide synthase and 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase , which are enzymes in the octadecanoid pathway leading to the production of oxygenated fatty-acids , were also wrky45-dependently upregulated. the role of the oxylipin jasmonic acid  in plant defense is well known; however, recent studies have revealed that oxylipins other than ja actively participate in plant defense mechanisms  <cit> . interestingly, osopr <dig>  which is responsible for ja synthesis  <cit> , was not among the three wrky45-dependently upregulated osoprs . the substrates and products of these osoprs and the end products of their biosynthetic pathways remain unknown.

several genes encoding tfs were wrky45-dependently upregulated by bth . in rice, wrky <dig> was reported to negatively regulate basal and xa21-mediated resistance to bacterial blight disease  <cit> . osnac <dig> is a positive regulator of programmed cell death associated with the hypersensitive reaction   <cit> . oshsf <dig> is the causative gene for a lesion mimic mutant, spontaneous lesion  <dig> , and its product negatively regulates plant cell death through decreasing cellular ros levels  <cit> .

temporal gene expression patterns of wrky45-dependent genes after dexamethasone-induced wrky <dig> expression
to characterize the temporal patterns of wrky45-dependent gene expression, we generated transgenic rice plants expressing c-terminally myc-tagged wrky <dig>  under the control of the dexamethasone -inducible promoter   <cit> . to test whether the wrky45-myc proteins were functional, we tested the wrky45-dex transformant lines  for blast resistance. the results showed that the wrky45-dex plants were more resistant than untransformed nipponbare to m. oryzae, even in the absence of dex treatment, presumably due to leaky expression of wrky45-myc. the resistance of wrky45-dex plants was further enhanced by dex treatment . these results confirmed that the wrky45-myc proteins retained their functions. wrky45-dex plants  grown on soil were sprayed with 60 μm dex or a mock solution at the 4- to 5-leaf stage, and the fourth leaves were harvested  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 24 h after each treatment. qrt-pcr analysis revealed that transgene-derived wrky <dig> transcripts  began to increase within 6 h after dex treatment . interestingly, transcript levels of endogenous wrky <dig> increased soon after the dex-induced increase of t-wrky <dig> , suggesting autoregulation of wrky <dig>  however, we did not observe transactivation of the wrky <dig> gene by wrky <dig> in a transient expression system , suggesting that the autoregulation was indirect or required an additional factor.

other wrky45-dependent bth-responsive genes showed various temporal expression patterns. the genes encoding two tfs, wrky <dig>  and osnac <dig> , were induced relatively early after the induction of t-wrky <dig>  almost concomitantly with endogenous wrky <dig>  while genes encoding another two tfs, oshsf <dig>  and ostify <dig> , were induced later . we also analyzed the expression of other genes randomly selected from other functional groups. some of these genes were upregulated later than endogenous wrky <dig>  with some  activated later than others  . a similar expression analysis using another independent transgenic line  gave consistent results.

responses of wrky45-regulated genes to m. oryzae infection
we characterized the responses of some of the wrky45-regulated genes to blast fungus infection in nb rice plants . cut leaves of rice plants were inoculated with a compatible race of m. oryzae  or mock treated, and transcript levels of selected wrky45-regulated genes were determined. the transcript level of wrky <dig> transiently and briefly increased in mock-treated leaves, presumably due to abiotic stresses such as high humidity, whereas m. oryzae inoculation delayed this early transcription of wrky <dig>  in addition, m. oryzae inoculation induced a second large peak of wrky <dig> transcription after 36 h. the transcription patterns of wrky <dig> and oshsf <dig> were similar to that of wrky <dig>  the transcription pattern of osnac <dig> differed in that it was induced soon after m. oryzae inoculation and again after 36 h. pen3-like  and p <dig>  genes were induced later than were the genes encoding wrky <dig> and other tfs. the timings of the transcription of these wrky45-regulated genes relative to that of wrky <dig>  especially the timing of the second peak of transcription, were similar to those observed after dex-induced expression of wrky <dig>  these results suggested that wrky <dig> plays a major role in defense gene expression after m. oryzae infection.

transactivation of osnac <dig> and wrky <dig> genes by wrky45
the dex-inducible expression of wrky45-myc proteins induced immediate upregulation of some wrky45-dependent bth-responsive genes encoding tfs besides wrky <dig> . these results led us to examine the transactivation of their genes by wrky <dig> using a transient expression assay in rice coleoptiles. co-delivery of the wrky <dig> effector gene markedly activated reporter genes in which the hrluc reporter gene was fused downstream of the upstream and intragenic sequences of the osnac <dig> gene . w-boxes  were present in the upstream region of osnac <dig> at - <dig>  mutation of these w-boxes drastically reduced the transactivation activity, corroborating that these are the cis elements where wrky <dig> interacts . a w-box was also present in the upstream region of wrky <dig> at - <dig> . however, this sequence did not mediate the activation of a reporter gene . these results suggest a possibility that wrky <dig> interacts with a non-w-box cis-element or a w-box downstream of the transcription start site in wrky <dig>  alternatively, wrky <dig> indirectly regulate wrky <dig> 

discussion
wrky <dig> regulates many bth-responsive genes
to understand the functions of a particular tf, it is important to identify the genes that are directly or indirectly regulated by it. constitutive overexpression of tfs can produce neomorphic phenotypes that do not necessarily reflect genuine functions of the tfs investigated  <cit> , because overexpressed tfs occasionally bind to nonphysiological targets. to avoid this problem, we used wrky45-kd rice in combination with bth treatment to identify wrky45-regulated genes. microarray-based screening identified more than  <dig> genes whose bth-responsiveness was wrky45-dependent . consistent with wrky <dig> being a transcriptional activator  <cit> , ~85% of these genes were upregulated in response to bth. considering the fact that bth-induced resistance to fungal and bacterial diseases was compromised in wrky45-kd rice, these results suggest that the cumulative effects of the functions of wrky45-regulated genes culminate in strong defense reactions.

role of wrky <dig> in the sa pathway in rice
in arabidopsis, expression of more than 99% of the bth-responsive genes is dependent on npr <dig>  and several wrky tfs are transcriptionally regulated downstream of npr <dig>  <cit> . our previous epistasis analyses demonstrated that in rice, wrky <dig> and osnpr <dig> are largely independent of each other in the sa-signaling pathway  <cit> . according to our transcript profiling  <cit> , two-thirds of bth-responsive genes in the osnpr1-dependent sub-pathway are bth-downregulated. these downregulated genes include several genes involved in photosynthesis and protein synthesis, suggesting that one of the major roles of osnpr <dig> is to relocate energy and resources from house-keeping cellular activities to defense activities  <cit> . this contrasts with wrky45-dependent bth-responsive genes identified in this study, in that ~85% of them were upregulated by bth. notably, most of them were independent of osnpr <dig> , whereas their presumed counterpart genes are npr1-dependent in arabidopsis  <cit> . these results were consistent with our proposal that the sa-signaling pathway in rice branches into wrky45-dependent and osnpr1-dependent sub-pathways  <cit> . similar to npr <dig>  wrky <dig> is degraded by the proteasome, whereas we did not observe degradation of osnpr <dig>  <cit> . these differences also seem to reflect the roles of wrky <dig> and osnpr <dig> in rice.

arabidopsis atwrky <dig> is phylogenetically close to rice wrky <dig>  <cit>  and is regulated downstream of npr <dig>  <cit> . the induction of the atwrky <dig> gene by sa is partially independent of npr <dig> during the early phase of induction  <cit> , but it becomes npr <dig> dependent later  <cit> . this implies an evolutionary relationship between atwrky <dig> and rice wrky <dig> 

wrky <dig> may regulate pre-invasive defense genes
our microscopic analysis revealed an effective pre-invasive defense response in wrky45-ox rice plants; that is, the infection of compatible m. oryzae was strongly blocked before the invasion of fungal hyphae into rice cells  <cit> . this is interesting in light of the repertoire of wrky45-regulated genes. in dicots, the pr proteins are secreted extracellularly through a protein secretary pathway during sar  <cit>  and during nonhost resistance  <cit> . the wrky45-dependent upregulation of pr genes suggests the involvement of pr proteins in the wrky45-dependent pre-invasive defense. studies of nonhost resistance in arabidopsis against barley powdery mildew  identified some components of pre-invasive defense mechanisms  <cit> . bednarek et al.  <cit>  proposed that pen <dig>  an abc transporter located in the plasma membrane, plays a role in transporting antimicrobial secondary metabolites  across the plasma membrane, leading to their extracellular accumulation. particular cytochrome p450s, gsts, and gtases have also been implicated in the synthesis of antimicrobial secondary metabolites  <cit> . it is interesting to note that some genes for abc transporters similar to pen <dig>  as well as several cytochrome p450s, gsts, and gtases, were among the wrky45-dependently regulated genes identified in this study. rice lacks the glucosinolate pathway; however, similar defense mechanisms involving yet-to-be-identified antimicrobial compounds could be involved in the wrky45-dependent pre-invasive defense response. a pre-invasive defense response was not observed in rice plants treated with probenazole under our experimental conditions  <cit> . because of this, we cannot conclude that the induction of pre-invasive defense is intrinsic to the function of wrky <dig> under natural conditions. further research is necessary to address this issue.

possible role of wrky <dig> in regulation of plant cell death
programmed cell death associated with the hr is an important part of various antimicrobial defense systems. reactive oxygen species  play a role in hr-associated defense mechanisms both as signaling molecules and as biochemical triggers of programmed cell death. iwai et al.  <cit>  reported that hr lesions formed on rice leaves when blast fungus was inoculated onto rice plants pretreated with probenazole. in a previous study, microscopic analyses showed that the post-invasive defense accompanying hr cell death occurred wrky45-dependently in probenazole-treated rice plants after m. oryzae infection  <cit> . in light of these observations, it is particularly interesting that osnac <dig> was regulated as a direct target of wrky <dig> in response to bth. overexpression of osnac <dig> cdna in cultured rice cells led to hr cell death accompanied by the loss of plasma membrane integrity and the fragmentation of nuclear dna  <cit> . thus, it seems possible that osnac <dig> regulates hr cell death in disease resistance induced by plant activators. protein phosphorylation was required for nuclear localization of osnac <dig> and hr cell death  <cit> . this might account for the occurrence of hr cell death only after fungus inoculation in probenazole-treated rice. osnac <dig> regulates hr cell death through its downstream genes, oshsp <dig> and iren, which are involved in the loss of plasma membrane integrity and nuclear dna fragmentation, respectively  <cit> . neither oshsp <dig> nor iren was found to be wrky45-dependent in the microarray analysis , nor were they upregulated after dex-induced expression of myc-tagged wrky <dig> . these results are consistent with the fact that post-translational regulation is required for osnac <dig> to induce hr cell death  <cit>  and are also consistent with the lack of hr cell death in wrky45-ox rice in the absence of pathogen inoculation.

oshsf <dig> is a tf whose dominant negative mutant spl <dig> shows lesion mimic spontaneous cell death , in which ros levels are increased . thus, the normal function of oshsf <dig> is presumably to suppress plant cell death by protecting plant cells from oxidative cellular damage caused by ros. necrotic plant cell death in an extensive area of the plant body can be damaging, and is also beneficial for hemibiotrophic pathogens such as m. oryzae. therefore, preventing necrotic plant cell death could be an important part of defense responses.

CONCLUSIONS
the repertoire of wrky45-dependent genes among bth-responsive genes is consistent with the idea that the rice sa pathway branches into two subpathways . the sequential expression of genes encoding transcription factors and defense genes, as well as the transactivation of tf genes by wrky <dig>  suggests a transcriptional cascade in which wrky <dig> regulates the genes encoding downstream tfs, which in turn regulate different sets of defense genes . overexpression of wrky <dig> induced extremely strong resistance to both the fungal pathogen m. oryzae and the bacterial pathogen xoo. the mighty potential of this tf is probably because it governs the sa-pathway-mediated defense responses as a master tf of this transcriptional cascade. the identification of wrky45-regulated genes has provided some insights into the defense reactions regulated by wrky <dig>  together with the phenotypes of wrky45-kd and -ox transformants. these analyses have also raised some questions, such as why wrky <dig>  which encodes a negative regulator of xoo resistance  <cit> , is regulated by wrky <dig>  functional characterization of each downstream tf will help to dissect further the defense mechanisms regulated by wrky <dig> and provide important information for its practical application.
