BACKGROUND
malaria is a killer disease that is responsible for >  <dig> million deaths annually  <cit> . given the global spread of multidrug-resistant malaria, there is an urgent need for new chemotherapeutic agents. of the four species of plasmodium, p. falciparum  is the most deadly owing to its ability to cytoadhere and cause complications like cerebral and placental malaria <cit> . the genome sequence of p. falciparum provided a foundation for studies on this organism, and is being exploited to search for new drug and vaccines candidates. the at richness of the p. falciparum genome poses immense challenges for its thorough computational analysis; in general, a majority of its genes remain not annotated  <cit> .

several antibiotics and drugs target ribosome complexes, the key machinery for translation of mrnas into polypeptides  <cit> . ribosomal biogenesis is an energy consuming and stringently regulated process inside the cell. in eukaryotes, it begins with the transcription of a pre-rrna molecules, which are modified and processed into smaller mature 18s,  <dig> s and 28s rrnas  <cit> . small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins  play a major role in the maturation of rrna molecules  <cit> . snornas are the small metabolically stable non-coding rnas present in the nucleoli of cells  <cit> . they play crucial roles in nucleotide modifications, viz methylation and pseudouridylation of various rnas like rrna, snrna, and trna. rrna modification is important for proper functioning of the translation machinery, and deregulation of nucleotide modification can lead to diseases like dyskeratosis congenita  <cit> . this disease is caused by point mutations in the human gene encoding dyskerin, responsible for pseudouridylation. in an another case, snorna hbii- <dig> is involved in the regulation of mrna processing  <cit> .

according to the conserved sequence motif and structural features, snorna  can be classified into two groups: box c/d and box h/aca snornas  <cit> . box c/d and box h/aca snornas guide rrna 2'-o-ribose methylation and pseudouridylation respectively by base pairing with the substrate rna molecules  <cit> . box c/d snornas contain two conserved sequence motifs, box c  and box d  which become proximal to each other due to short stems which constitute the structural core motif of the snorna. commonly, box c/d and h/aca snornas are about 65– <dig> and 120– <dig> bases in size respectively  <cit> . in vertebrates, snornas are predominantly located in introns of ribosomal proteins and housekeeping genes, whereas in yeast, most of them are transcribed from independent promoters  <cit> . intron-encoded snorna genes can follow different pathways for maturation: splicing dependent or independent  <cit> .

in most eukaryotes, the copy number of rrna genes is high and they are present as tandem repeats. however, plasmodium genome is unique amongst eukaryotes where rrna genes have very few copies, and they are present on different chromosomes  <cit> . moreover, two distinct types of developmentally regulated, cytoplasmic rrna transcripts have been detected in the parasite <cit> . one type of transcript is predominant in the asexual stages of the parasite life cycle, and the other in the sexual stages. the ratio of these two types of transcripts changes dramatically during the developmental cycle of the parasite, but neither of them disappears completely at any stage of the life cycle <cit> . both of them are distinct in length and also differ in sequence in some non-conserved regions. since the highly conserved genomic organization of rrna genes amongst eukaryotes becomes different in plasmodium, all aspects related to ribosome biogenesis in plasmodium call for special interest. a better understanding of ribosome structure and its biogenesis pathways may help in the development of anti-malarial drugs. snornas and other trans-acting proteins comprise an important component of ribosomal biogenesis, making their identification and analysis of their genetic organization and evolutionary linkages important for understanding their role in plasmodium.

genes corresponding to snornas have been identified in rice, drosophila, yeast and various other organisms  <cit> . recent studies reveal that snornas are a new class of non-autonomous mobile genetic elements that traverse using rna intermediates <cit> . in the present work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the snorna genes present in malaria parasites. our study reveals the following key features of malaria parasite snornas:  structural features of box c/d snorna are highly conserved in plasmodium genus,  unlike other organisms, most snornas in malaria parasites are present as a single copy,  genomic localization patterns are mixture of those observed in plants, yeast and vertebrates; parasite snornas are present in clusters and introns of a gene  we have found snornas in 3'utr of an mrna, a feature not reported in any organism till date,  and finally, we propose that as in mammals, the parasite snornas may behave as mobile genetic elements.

RESULTS
proteins involved in ribosomal biogenesis
considering the unusual gene structure and developmentally regulated transcription of ribosomal rna in plasmodium, we have tried to study the process of ribosomal biogenesis in this genus. amongst all the eukaryotes, ribosomal biogenesis is most studied in yeast, leading to identification of various genes important for processing and maturation of pre-rrna. we have used sequences of proteins involved in yeast ribosomal biogenesis pathways to find their homologues in pf and tried to delineate pathways of ribosomal biogenesis in plasmodium. we have searched for all the ribosomal proteins in pf genome and also the trans-acting factors that have a role in ribosomal biogenesis .

plasmodium falciparum genome contains genes corresponding to all ribosomal proteins that are present in small and large subunits of eukaryotic ribosome, except rpl <dig>  these ribosomal proteins share high sequence identity with their counterparts in yeast and human. ribosomal proteins are unlike other plasmodia proteins that are generally larger than their homologues in other eukaryotes.

as soon as rna polymerase transcribes pre-rrna, the transcript is modified, mainly by pseudouridylation and 2'-o-ribose-methylation, at specific sites selected by snornp complex <cit> . this is followed by cleavage in 3' external transcribed spacer  by an endoribonuclease rnt1p, a homologue of bacterial rnase iii. box c/d snornp complex, responsible for 2'-o-ribose-methylation is constituted of a small rna molecule  and various proteins . similarly, box h/aca snornp complex responsible for psuedouridylation is comprised of a rna molecule  and proteins . through our analysis we could find homologues of each protein present in the snornp complexes, but the gene corresponding to rnt1p enzyme was absent from plasmodium genome, when searched using psi-blast .

exosome is a multi-protein complex of 3'-5' exoribonuclease which is responsible for maturation and processing of pre-rrna and many other rna like pre-mrna and small rnas <cit> . exosome is composed of 9– <dig> subunit proteins, of which six  have sequence identity with the e. coli rnase ph domain. genes corresponding to rrp <dig>  rrp <dig>  rrp <dig>  rrp <dig>  rrp <dig>  rrp <dig> and csl <dig> could be identified in the plasmodium genome. however, homologues of rrp <dig> and mtr <dig> could not be found in pf genome, whereas rrp <dig> and rrp <dig> shared homology with a single protein pf14_ <dig> 

identification of putative box c/d snorna
an analysis of methylation sites from various organisms reveals that rrna 2'-o-methylation sites are highly conserved <cit> . we therefore used known yeast and human methylation sites to find putative methylation sites in pf ribosomal rnas by aligning its 18s and 28s rrna  sequences with those from yeast and human. each of the mapped methylation sites in asexual and sexual stage rrna of plasmodium falciparum were observed to lie in conserved regions. for further studies we considered only the asexually expressed rrna sequences. the program snoscan was used to predict snorna genes in the pf genome  <cit> . more than  <dig> box c/d snorna genes were predicted for different methylation sites in the small  and large subunits  of ribosomal rrnas. to eliminate false positive snorna genes, we used the following strategy – methylation sites generated from the above-mentioned alignment were matched with the sites predicted for putative snorna  to generate a subset of relevant snorna genes . interestingly, none of the snorna genes present in this subset localized to the protein-coding regions. they were present either in introns or in intergenic regions, and had canonical box c  and box d  motifs. therefore, after removing all those predicted snornas, which were either localized in the protein coding regions or did not have canonical box c and d motifs,  <dig> snorna were left.

we also extracted  <dig> nucleotides upstream and downstream of each of these  <dig> snorna gene and rescanned them through snoscan program with lower cutoffs. different introns of a gene harbouring a snorna were also searched for other low scoring box c/d snorna genes. this helped us identify two additional snorna genes, pfs <dig> and pfs <dig> in the introns of pf11_ <dig> and pf14_ <dig> respectively. table  <dig> summarizes the  <dig> snornas of pf, and sequences of these are given in table  <dig>  a schematic representation of some of the snorna genes in context of the genome is shown in figure  <dig>  we have named the genes with the initial two characters representing the species and the following characters specify snorna number. for example pfs <dig> represents p. falciparum snorna <dig> and pvs <dig> refers to p. vivax snorna  <dig>

homologues of pf snorna genes from other plasmodium species
orthologous loci of other plasmodium species  were searched for snorna genes, as outlined in additional file  <dig>  of the  <dig> predicted box c/d snorna genes from p. falciparum, most have potential orthologs in other plasmodium species indicating the highly conserved nature of snornas in this genus. however, homologues of pfs <dig> could not be found in any other species of plasmodium. pfs <dig> is a paralog of pfs <dig> since both guide the same methylation site, suggesting that this may be a recent case of gene duplication. phylogenetic analysis of homologous snornas revealed that p. vivax most likely diverged from p. falciparum very early. the data indicate that p. knowlesi is evolutionarily closer to p. vivax, whereas p. falciparum seems more related to p. gallinaceum . these evolutionary pattern retained phylogenetic deductions made by analysis of other conserved genes like rrna genes  <cit> .

snorna expression analysis by northern hybridization and rt-pcr
parasite rna was isolated from in vitro cultured erythrocytic stages of pf parasites. expression of each of the predicted pf snorna was tested using two independent techniques – northern hybridization and reverse transcriptase pcr assays. for the latter, total rna was used, whereas for northern hybrization we used rna enriched in small rna. out of the  <dig> predicted snorna genes, expression could be confirmed for 14;  <dig> using northern hybridization and one using reverse-transcriptase pcr assay . multiple bands could be observed in northern blots of pfs <dig>  pfs <dig> and pfs <dig>  most likely owing to their processing from longer pre-snorna transcripts. pfs <dig> northern blot has two major bands, one corresponding to the size of the snorna and other probably to pre-snorna. the other low intensity band may be due to processing intermediates and degradation products. no experimental evidence for the expression of pfs <dig> and pfs <dig> was found, which may be either due to low number of detectable transcripts or lack of transcription of these genes in the erythrocytic stages of parasites. we were also able to find sequences of many snornas in the expressed sequence tags  database of plasmodb , an observation that validates snorna expression in other species of plasmodium.

structural features of p. falciparum box c/d snornas
the two conserved motifs, box c and d are present in all snorna genes, and are immediately followed by a 4– <dig> bases inverse repeat, which forms the terminal stem structure that brings the two boxes in close proximity. this is an important feature required for the stability and function of snornps  <cit> . some snornas also contain two antisense motifs  complementary to different target sequences. we were able to identify  <dig> box c/d snorna genes exhibiting all the canonical structural features including box c, box d, terminal stem and at least one region  complementary to the rrna. some deviations were observed in the d' sequence of some snorna genes . in the case of pfs <dig>  the ctga motif is a part of the antisense element , while ttga forms the d' box. a total of four  snornas have two antisense regions, which may be responsible for methylation at two different sites instead of one. pfs <dig> shows a unique feature of having two antisense regions in tandem, one of which matches with the antisense region of pfs <dig>  five  snornas have a box c' motif . for all snornas present in introns , the distance between splice sites and the snorna ends were greater than hundred bases, which is required for splicing dependent maturation of snorna  <cit> .

contrary to the general observation that pf genes are longer than their counterparts in other organisms, size of snorna identified in this study falls in the generally observed range of 70– <dig> bases, with an exception of pfs <dig>  which is  <dig> nucleotides long  <cit> . interestingly, a homologue of pfs <dig> in p. vivax is only  <dig> nucleotides in length, as a polya repeat present in other species is absent from p. vivax. additionally, a conserved polya followed by ta-repeats was observed downstream of many snorna genes. polya repeat is a common feature observed downstream of retroposons.

the genomic organization of box c/d snorna in malaria parasites
genomic organization of snorna genes varies from one species to another. nine out of  <dig> snorna genes  in pf are present on chromosome  <dig>  and the rest of them are distributed on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . nine out of  <dig> snornas in pf are present in introns of protein-coding genes. another  <dig> are localized downstream of gene encoding ribosomal proteins. pfs <dig> is located in an intron of the gene for guanine nucleotide binding protein. this protein is a mediator for many cellular processes, including signal transduction, protein transport, growth regulation and polypeptide chain regulation  <cit> . pf11_ <dig>  a homologue of enp <dig> protein, harbors snornas pfs <dig>  pfs <dig> and pfs <dig> . enp <dig> protein has a role in early processing and maturation of ribosomal rna  <cit> . two of the snornas indentified, pfs <dig> and pfs <dig> are in the same intron of ribosomal protein s27a, a feature unlike vertebrates but similar to plants, which have a cluster of snorna genes in the same intron  <cit> . three snornas pfs <dig>  pfs <dig> and pfs <dig> are present downstream of pf14_ <dig>  a ribosomal protein of l7a family, while pfs <dig> and pfs <dig> are present downstream of pf14_ <dig> that belongs to the l <dig> family. the last intron of pf14_ <dig> gene carries a snorna pfs <dig>  which shifts its locus downstream of the stop codon for the same gene in other plasmodium species, except in p. vivax . pfs <dig> is present downstream of protein pf14_ <dig> which is homologous to a ribosomal protein s <dig>  the intergenic distance between pfs <dig> and pfs <dig> is just  <dig> bp, which is reminiscent of two genes transcribed as a single transcript and further processed into mature snorna. in order to test the same, we performed a reverse transcriptase pcr assay using specific forward primer against pfs <dig> and reverse primer against pfs <dig>  our results show  that these snornas are present in a cluster and are transcribed as a longer rna transcript together from a single promoter. they are subsequently processed further into two mature snornas, pfs <dig> and pfs <dig>  similarly, pvs <dig> and pvs <dig> in p. vivax are also coded as a polycistronic gene. both these snornas are localized in the sequence of an expressed sequence tag  cx <dig> of p. vivax .

the 3' utr harbours snorna genes
many of the identified snornas from pf  lie just  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bases downstream of the stop codon of genes pf14_ <dig>  pf14_ <dig> and pf14_ <dig> respectively, and are likely to be contained within their 3' utr. we performed reverse transcriptase pcr assays using specific forward primer against the 3' end of their protein coding region and reverse primer specific for the snorna gene. our results show  that pfs <dig> is located in the 3' utr of the ribosomal protein l7a. in the case of pfs <dig>  we did not observe any amplified product, which implies that it does not lie in the utr. for pfs <dig>  a conclusive result could not be obtained, as the amplified product was smaller than the expected size . pvs <dig>  the homologue of pfs <dig> in p. vivax was also localized to the 3' utr of the ribosomal protein l7a . pvs <dig> is present in the sequence of an est cv <dig>  whose sequence overlaps with the 3' end of another est cv <dig>  sequence of the 5' end of cv <dig> was identical to the coding region of ribosomal protein l7a in p. vivax. so, using sequences of these two overlapping ests, we calculated that the length of 3' utr of ribosomal protein l7a gene should be at least  <dig> bases. since the distance between stop codon of this gene and pvs <dig> is just  <dig> bases, the snorna should be present in the 3' utr of the ribosomal protein l7a gene. this is a novel gene organization not reported in any other organism till date.

identical copies of pks <dig> with polya tail
two identical copies of a pks <dig>  which is a homolog of pfs <dig>  are present at different loci in the p. knowlesi genome . snorna gene on pkn. <dig> has polya repeats at 5' and 3' ends whereas pkn. <dig> has poly a repeats at 3' end only . other species of plasmodium have only one snorna at similar loci as of pkn. <dig> 

discussion
the aim of this work was to identify various genes involved in ribosomal biogenesis pathway of malaria parasite. various proteins and rna molecules like rna helicases, u <dig> snorna, rna mrp have been identified and reported earlier in pf  <cit> . the structures and sequences of 5' ets of the different stage specific pre-rrna are also known from a previous study, but no information is available for 3' ets <cit> . the present study highlights the differences in the pathway, where gene for a particular function  is missing in the pf genome. absence of any factor would indicate deviation from the known pathway and would call for identification of alternative mechanisms present in malaria parasites.

in spite of the differences in the gene structure and transcription pattern of rrna genes in plasmodium, the protein components of ribosome do not show much difference. we could identify homologues for each of the proteins present in large and small subunit of the ribosome, except rpl <dig>  the sequence identity with yeast and human homologues for most of the ribosomal proteins were higher than 60%, which indicate conservation of protein structure and function.

most of the trans-acting factors responsible for ribosomal biogenesis are present in the parasite genome. proteins present in the various complexes like box c/d snornp, box h/aca snornp, u <dig> snornp and exosome have their homologues in the parasite genome. we were unable to find a homologue for the endoribonuclease rnt1p, responsible for the cleavage in 3' ets of pre-rrna. this step of ribosomal biogenesis in malaria parasite seems to differ from yeast and the protein responsible for this function in pf may be a drug target. further study is required to identify the sequences of 3' ets of pre-rrna and various proteins involved in the alternative pathway for its processing.

chakrabarti et al have reported the existence of 2'-o-methylation and snornas in malaria parasites <cit> . they have identified non coding rnas using gc content, rna folding potential and sequence conservations. we have predicted box c/d snorna genes of p. falciparum using a different computational method based on hidden markov model , which has enabled us to identify even those snorna which are present in only one species. identification of species specific snorna helps to understand the mechanism of snorna evolution. out of the  <dig> snorna genes in this study,  <dig> were reported by chakrabarti et al. additionally we have identified some new snorna genes not listed in the previous report. these are: pfs <dig>  which guides methylation on a site identical to that for pfs15; and pfs <dig>  whose size differs amongst species due to a small aa rich insertion in the gene. additionally, we also report the presence of two identical copies of pks <dig> in p. knowlesi genome. identification of gene duplication in the genome shed new light on the mechanism of evolution of snornas in plasmodium genus.

we have confirmed the expression of snorna genes using northern hybridization and reverse transcriptase pcr assays. we have also identified the orthologs of these genes in other plasmodium species. a comparative study of these snornas has revealed features unique to malaria parasite. most of the snornas in vertebrates are localized to introns of protein coding genes  <cit> . in yeast, most snornas are transcribed from their independent promoters  <cit> , barring a few intron-encoded genes. in the case of plasmodium, we found a mixture of localization patterns observed in yeast, vertebrates and plants . table  <dig> summarizes the comparative study of these snornas, all of which have similar target sites in pf, yeast, humans and arabidopsis. all the  <dig> human snornas are located in introns as compared to only nine in case of pf and four for yeast. eight of the snornas in yeast are monocistronic and five exist as polycistronic genes. in the case of arabidopsis, all these are present in cluster and are transcribed as polycistronic genes, whereas, in pf two gene clusters were observed, one in the case of pfs <dig> and pfs <dig> and another in the case of pfs <dig> and pfs <dig> . in both vertebrates and yeast, one intron harbours single snorna gene but in plants, there are reports of clustered snorna genes present in a single intron  <cit> . plasmodium falciparum has a cluster of two snornas, viz pfs <dig> and pfs <dig>  which are present in the same intron of pf 14_ <dig> .

genomic localization of homologous snorna genes of yeast, human and arabidopsis, which guide methylation of similar sites as in plasmodium. localization information is given in the adjacent right hand side brackets. utr, p, c, m, s, u and i stand for untranslated region, polycistronic, clustered, monocistronic, single c/d box snorna in intergenic region, unknown and intron-encoded respectively.

trypanosomatids are unicellular parasitic protozoa which are the causative agents of several infamous parasitic diseases, such as african trypanosomiasis, caused by trypanosoma brucei; chagas' disease, caused by trypanosoma cruzi; and leishmaniasis, caused by leishmania species and have a dual host like malaria parasites. most snornas in these organisms are clustered in reiterated repeats that carry a mixed population of c/d and h/aca-like rnas <cit> . prediction of the modifications guided by these rnas and using partial mapping data,  <dig> 2'-o-methyls  and  <dig> pseudouridines were identified on rrnas, suggesting a high occurrence of nms as compared to pseudouridines on rrna. occurrence of a mixed population of box c/d and h/aca snornas and a higher number of nms than psuedouridylation is in line with findings in plasmodium as reported by chakrabarti et al <cit> .

the functional and evolutionary significance of utrs of eukaryotic transcripts remains unclear. there are reports of introns in the utrs of rna transcripts but their functional significance is unknown <cit> . in this work, we show that snorna pfs <dig> is contained within the 3' utr of the rna transcript of ribosomal protein l7a using rt-pcr. identification of polya site of the mrna using 3' race would be another method to prove this. the homolog of pfs <dig>  pvs <dig> in p. vivax is also located in the 3' utr of the ribosomal protein l7a gene. localization of snornas in 3' utr is a novel organization not reported in any other organism till date.

pfs <dig> is located in an intron of a ribosomal protein pf14_ <dig> but its homologues in p. chabaudi, p. berghei and p. yoelii are present downstream of the last exon. the three snornas pfs <dig>  pfs <dig> and pfs <dig> are present in introns of enp <dig> gene of pf but are localized differently in different species . from these observations, it seems likely that human and malaria parasite snornas prefer to localize in introns rather than in intergenic regions. harbouring snorna genes in introns and utrs of a constitutively expressed gene may be a more efficient and coordinated method for transcription. in case of p. vivax, the mrna of enp <dig> gene does not code for the full protein. it is probable that the mrna harbouring snorna genes has lost its translational capability, which is reported in many cases  <cit> .

an interesting observation shows that pfs <dig> and pfs <dig> are evolutionarily linked and may have evolved from a common ancestor. both pfs <dig> and pfs <dig> have an identical antisense region. pfs <dig> has two regions complementary to rrna, one for 18s tm <dig> and another for 28s gm <dig>  whereas pfs <dig> has for 18s a <dig> and 28s am <dig>  regions for 28s –  <dig> and  <dig> are similar, except for deletion of a cytidine from pfs <dig> antisense region, leading to change in target site.

studies on mammalian snorna genes have revealed that they are a new class of mobile genetic elements  <cit> . it has been proposed that retroposition followed by genetic drift is a mechanism that can increase snorna diversity during vertebrate evolution to eventually acquire new rna-modification functions. in this study, our results imply that this mechanism may hold true in plasmodium also. in the first case, two identical copies of a homologue of pfs <dig> are present in the p. knowlesi genome, whereas only a single copy is present in other species. sequence alignment of these two loci with flanking regions suggests a 'copy-paste mechanism', as observed in case of retrotransposons . we propose that snorna duplication may be due to their behaviour as snorts because of two reasons 1) both the copies are 100% identical with few bases of overhangs and one of them had a poly a at the 5' end of the sequence , whereas the other copy doesn't have it; presence of polya tail is an important feature of transposons that traverse using rna intermediates 2) only p. knowlesi has two copies whereas other species of plasmodium have only one copy. the parental copy may be the snorna present on pkn. <dig> which may have been lost during evolution in other species. since this is the only identified cases of snort in plasmodium, our hypothesis cannot be conclusively verified. similar studies on h/aca snornas may help to draw a final conclusion. in another case, pfs <dig> is conserved in plasmodium species but its paralog – pfs <dig>  is absent from another species, indicative of gene duplication.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified snorna genes in malaria parasite and have done a comprehensive analysis of their structural features and genomic organisation, which has helped us to understand the mechanism of evolution of snorna genes. like rrna genes, these are present in low copy numbers and their patterns of gene organization are a mixture of those observed in other organisms. a feature unique to plasmodium is the localization of snorna genes in 3' utr of the ribosomal protein genes. as in mammals, snornas may behave as retrotransposons in plasmodium and may be one of the mechanisms of snorna evolution. the gene for the endoribonuclease rnt <dig> is absent from malaria parasites genome, which indicates the existence of alternative pre-rrna processing pathways as compared with the one in yeast.
