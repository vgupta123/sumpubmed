BACKGROUND
gene expression research is a rapidly evolving field with recent advances in technologies aimed at multi-gene expression profiling and high throughput screening. technologies like high-density dna microarrays enable one to perform parallel gene expression profiling in the scale of tens of thousands of genes in a single experiment  <cit> . quantitative real-time-pcr, though lacking the scale of microarrays, is a rapid, sensitive and less complex method for gene expression analysis and offers an alternative approach for parallel profiling of multiple targets as well as a time-saving means to validate microarray results.

with many different technologies available for gene expression measurement, the need to compare the results obtained from different platforms and technologies and thus the reliability and biological significance of those results becomes evident. moreover, concerns regarding the reliability and consistency of the microarray technology from different suppliers, different test sites and when using different methods for data processing and normalization have been raised  <cit> . to address those concerns, scientists from the us food and drug administration  established the microarray quality control  consortium to evaluate the performance of several microarray platforms as well as three quantitative gene expression assays  <cit> . the microarray platforms were from affymetrix , agilent techonologies  or two-color protocol ), applied biosystems , ge healthcare , illumina , eppendorf  and the national cancer institute , and the three quantitative assays were taqman® gene expression assay , standardized  rt-pcr™  and quantigene® .

reports from the phase  <dig> study of the maqc project, which profiled two standardized reference rna samples, contain important findings on the performance of different expression measurement technologies and give insights into the level of cross-platform comparability among different technologies  <cit> . the comprehensive data sets generated from this maqc effort showed that great inter-site and cross-platform consistency can be achieved among different technologies  <cit> . importantly, the selection criteria used to define differentially expressed genes has a substantial impact on the overlap of the resulting gene lists, with gene lists generated by fold change ranking being more reproducible than those obtained by t-test p value ranking. with these findings, the maqc consortium recommends fold change ranking using a nonstringent p-value cutoff for gene selection. another important goal attained by this project is to generate a thoroughly characterized reference data set against which new modifications in the existing microarray platforms and other expression measurement technologies can be compared and validated, and laboratory performance can be assessed. this was accomplished by providing the community with two commercially available high-quality human reference rna samples that can be used as a tool for calibration and quality control as well as for performance assessment and validation of assays. the two rna samples used in the maqc project were the stratagene universal human reference rna  and the ambion human brain reference rna. extremely large lots of these two reference rnas were produced under stringent quality-control procedures. this has allowed researchers to assess the performance of their assays over time using the same rna samples from identical manufacturing lots and to compare their results with the maqc data set.

the platforms evaluated in the maqc project can be categorized into either hybridization-based or pcr-based technologies. different platforms of microarray and quantigene assays belong to hybridization-based technology. for microarrays, rna samples are labeled with a tag  followed by hybridization to immobilized gene-specific probes and fluorophore-based detection. quantigene is a sandwich nucleic acid hybridization system that detects rna directly  <cit> . targets are captured through joint hybridization of multiple probes, and the complex is detected by signal amplification through a branched dna amplifier and chemiluminescence signal production. taqman gene expression assays and start-pcr are pcr-based techniques. start-pcr is a competitive end-point pcr-based assay. a standardized mixture of internal standard  competitive templates is added to the reverse transcribed products prior to pcr. the individual endpoint start-pcr products are then separated by size and quantified by high-throughput microfluidic electrophoresis  <cit> . the taqman assay is based on real-time pcr using a fluorescent dye to monitor the amplification of target genes by dna polymerase. it employs a target-specific, dual-labeled, fluorogenic hybridization probe with a quencher on the 3' end to be hydrolyzed by the 5' to 3' exonuclease activity of taq polymerase during the extension step  <cit> .

real-time pcr is widely considered the gold standard for gene expression measurement due to its high assay specificity, high detection sensitivity and wide linear dynamic range. in addition to the taqman assay, the sybr® green pcr assay is another commonly used real-time pcr technique which is employed by half of all real-time pcr users  <cit> . despite its widespread use, this technique was surprisingly not included as part of the maqc project. sybr green pcr is widely used because of the ease in designing the assays and its relatively low setup and running costs. unlike taqman fluorescent probes, sybr green dye intercalates into double-stranded dna to monitor the amplification of target gene specifically initiated by gene-specific primers. one drawback of sybr green assays, however, is that the dye is non-specific and can generate false positive signals if non-specific products or primer-dimers are present in the assay. those problems can be addressed by carefully designing the primers and validating the pcr products with dissociation curve analysis immediately after pcr. in addition, other approaches have been practiced to further increase the specificity of sybr green detection, such as a "hot start" strategy using a dna polymerase that requires heat activation, or acquisition of fluorescence signals at a temperature slightly below the melting temperature of the desired amplicon but above which nonspecific primer-dimer related products will denature and produce minimal signals  <cit> .

in the present study, we have evaluated the performance of superarray's sybr green real-time pcr assays in profiling the same two reference rna samples analyzed by the maqc consortium. using the maqc data sets available from the public database  <cit> , we conducted similar analyses for the rt <dig> profiler pcr arrays and compared our expression profiling results with those generated from the three quantitative technologies  as well as from five of the commercial microarray platforms  examined in the maqc project  <cit> .

RESULTS
assay performance of sybr green real-time pcr
to assess the performance of sybr green real-time pcr, the same two reference rna samples of the identical manufacturing lots as the maqc study  <cit>  were analyzed using sybr green rt <dig> profiler pcr arrays from superarray bioscience. sample a was universal human reference rna from stratagene and sample b was human brain reference rna from ambion. in maqc phase  <dig> study,  <dig> genes were selected for cross-platform comparisons between microarrays and the quantitative platforms  <cit> . among these  <dig> genes,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were assessed by taqman, quantigene and start-pcr assays, respectively. the gene list for the custom rt <dig> profiler pcr array in this study was designed to overlap with the maximum possible number of genes for which maqc data are available from the three quantitative platforms in the maqc project . a total of  <dig> genes were selected, among which  <dig> genes overlapped with taqman data,  <dig> genes overlapped with quantigene data, and  <dig> genes overlapped with start-pcr data. in addition, these  <dig> selected genes overlapped with data available for  <dig> genes on the afx and abi,  <dig> on the ag <dig>   <dig> on the geh, and  <dig> on the ilm platforms. the custom pcr array was run in six technical replicates for each of the two maqc reference rnas . for cross-platform comparisons between sybr green pcr arrays and other gene expression analysis platforms evaluated in the maqc study, data from the other technologies were obtained from published results  <cit>  and from the database accessible from the maqc website  <cit> . the comparison of performance metrics between sybr green pcr arrays and the other three quantitative platforms assessed in the maqc study is summarized in additional file  <dig> 

assay precision
the precision of the superarray's sybr green real-time pcr arrays is assessed by the coefficient of variation  and standard deviation  of the replicate ct measurements  from both samples a and b . the average cv for the  <dig> mean ct values generated from all assays on the custom pcr arrays is  <dig> %. all assays on pcr arrays have an average ct value showing a cv below 5% with 95% of the ct values having a cv of less than 2% . the replicate measurements for ct values below  <dig> show an average standard deviation within  <dig>  cycle . as noted in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  both cv and sd tend to increase with increasing ct values ; this trend has also been observed for both taqman and start-pcr  <cit> . the above precision assessment also includes variations from the entire process of reverse transcription-pcr as each replicate array was performed on cdna synthesized from individual replicate reverse transcription reactions. to make a comparison with the other three quantitative technologies examined in the maqc project, the ct values obtained from pcr arrays were transformed from a decreasing copy number scale to an increasing copy number scale applied in the maqc study  <cit> . using the same assumption as for taqman pcr where a ct value of  <dig> corresponds to five transcript molecules, the ct value for  <dig> transcript molecules is extrapolated to be  <dig> . this value is calculated to be  <dig>   on the common maqc transformed log <dig> scale. after data transformation, the cvs for all  <dig> assays on pcr arrays range from  <dig> % to  <dig> % with a median of  <dig> %, and those for assays detecting >  <dig> transcript copies  range from  <dig> % to  <dig> % with a median of  <dig> %.

a total of  <dig> average ct measurements were obtained from sample a and sample b. each average ct value and its standard deviation were calculated from the result of  <dig> replicate assays.

detection sensitivity
pcr array quantification is determined by ct numbers. a gene is considered absent when the average ct exceeds  <dig>  among the  <dig> genes that were assayed with sybr green pcr arrays, seven genes are considered absent in sample b with the average ct >  <dig>  these genes are foxa <dig>  abcc <dig>  apob, apoh, mmp <dig>  rad <dig> and tff <dig>  all of these genes were considered to be either absent or expressed at low levels as measured by taqman and quantigene  <cit> . foxa <dig> was also noted to be absent by start-pcr while the other six genes were not included in the measurements by this method. all genes are present in sample a at a level above the limit of quantitation  in the maqc study  <cit> ) of pcr arrays with the average ct values smaller than  <dig>  hence,  <dig> out of the  <dig> selected genes  are present in both sample a and sample b.

assay range
the assay range is indicated by the difference in signals on a log <dig> scale between the highest and the lowest expression as described previously  <cit> . the assay range for the sybr green pcr arrays is  <dig>  with ct values ranging from  <dig>  for 18s rrna to  <dig> for weakly expressed genes.

inter-site reproducibility
inter-site comparison of the performance of sybr green pcr arrays was carried out using the human drug metabolism rt <dig> profiler™ pcr array  from superarray bioscience. for inter-site comparison, the two maqc reference rnas were analyzed on the pcr array at two different locations. pcr arrays were performed on an abi  <dig> real-time pcr system at site  <dig> while the arrays were run on an abi  <dig> at site  <dig>  five replicate arrays were run for each sample at each site. the average ct value for each assay was compared between the two sites . the results show a high correlation between ct values obtained from the two sites with r =  <dig>  and  <dig>  for sample a and sample b, respectively . moreover, the inter-site comparison of fold-change results obtained from these data shows a correlation coefficient of  <dig>  . since the two test sites used two different models of real-time pcr thermal cyclers from applied biosystems for the above comparison, we investigated if the use of different real-time pcr instruments could contribute to the differences in the ct and fold-change results. we compared the gene expression results obtained using three different real-time pcr thermal cycler models from different manufacturers  and found that the correlations observed among different models of real-time pcr instruments are similar to those between the two test sites .

cross-platform comparisons with other technologies
to evaluate the concordance of fold changes between sybr green pcr arrays and other technologies evaluated in the maqc study, we performed regression analyses of fold differences in sample b compared to sample a for all genes common between the custom rt <dig> profiler pcr arrays and another platform. in addition, a list of differentially expressed genes  was identified for each platform between the two reference rna samples using the cut-off criteria of a p value less than  <dig>  by an unpaired t-test with a mean difference greater than or equal to 2-fold, and the lists of degs from different platforms were compared.

fold-change correlation between pcr arrays and other quantitative platforms
sybr green rt <dig> profiler™ pcr arrays display high concordance with taqman, quantigene and start-pcr in measuring fold differences between sample a and sample b. data from regression analysis show that the correlation coefficient r and slope for rt <dig> profiler pcr arrays versus taqman are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively; for rt <dig> profiler pcr arrays versus quantigene are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively; and for rt <dig> profiler pcr arrays versus start-pcr are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . rt <dig> profiler pcr arrays are shown to be best correlated with taqman assays . when these results are compared with the maqc data sets, similar fold-change correlations versus quantigene and start-pcr are noted for both rt <dig> profiler pcr arrays and taqman . fold-change results between sample a and sample b from all four quantitative platforms and the lists of differentially expressed genes  generated using the pre-set criteria  are compared. pcr arrays display a high percentage of cross-platform overlap with the other quantitative platforms, ranging from 81% to 93%.

fold-change correlation between pcr arrays and microarray platforms
results from regression analysis showed a good linear correlation in the log <dig> fold change data between sybr green pcr arrays and the five microarray platforms  selected for this study . the correlation coefficients and linear slopes for the comparison between pcr arrays and different microarray platforms are as follows:  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, for afx;  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, for ag1;  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, for abi;  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, for geh; and  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, for ilm. the above results from these cross-platform comparisons with microarrays are very similar to those obtained from taqman as seen in the maqc project . the overlap in the lists of degs between pcr arrays and each of the five microarrays is also high, yielding a 73% to 90% range.

discordant gene analysis
comparisons between the fold-change results of the sybr green pcr arrays and those of the other platforms reveal discordance in a few genes . we define a gene to be discordant if the gene exhibits changes in the opposite direction with pcr arrays and another platform being compared, and at least one of these two platforms indicates the gene to be differentially expressed . by these criteria, two genes, furin and rb <dig>  are found discordant between pcr arrays and the other quantitative platforms . taqman shows a fold change of - <dig>  for furin but pcr arrays indicate a fold change of  <dig>  for this gene. start-pcr, quantigene and the five microarray platforms show a fold change ranging from - <dig>  and  <dig>  for furin. hence, no difference in the expression of furin between samples a and b is observed with any platforms except taqman.

fold-change values for the above platforms other than rt <dig> profiler pcr arrays are derived from the data provided by maqc studies  <cit> . a positive value for fold change indicates a higher expression while a negative value indicates a lower expression in sample b when compared with sample a. "n/a" means the gene was not included in the indicated platform. discordant fold-change values compared to rt <dig> pcr arrays are underlined and in bold. *the fold-change value for rb <dig> gene from the pcr array using the corrected sequence is - <dig>  .

the other discordant gene, rb <dig>  exhibits a fold change of  <dig>  with pcr arrays but a fold change of - <dig>  with quantigene. taqman and start-pcr indicate fold changes of - <dig>  and - <dig> , respectively, for rb <dig>  all of the five microarray platforms show negative fold changes with four of the platforms indicating a twofold or greater change. interestingly, the rb <dig> gene was originally indicated by pcr arrays to be absent  in both samples a and b. this finding was in contrast to the results from the other three quantitative platforms where the gene was considered to be present and moderately to highly expressed in both rna samples  <cit> . this discrepancy was later found to arise from the probing location of the primers for rb <dig> in pcr arrays being based on a former version of the refseq accession  which had been revised to the current refseq release  on june  <dig>   <dig>  the revised refseq accession revealed a two-base mismatch  with the former version in the region where one of the rb <dig> primers for pcr arrays happened to recognize. upon repeating the assays using the rb <dig> primer with the revised sequence, the rb <dig> gene is now considered to be present with an average ct value of around 23– <dig> in both samples. results generated from this new rb <dig> assay show a fold change of - <dig>  for this gene, which is in agreement with taqman and start-pcr, and have replaced the data obtained from the old rb <dig> assay for the rest of the data analyses in this study.

six other discordant genes besides rb <dig> are noted between sybr green pcr arrays and the five microarray platforms . of those six discordant genes, one gene with afx, four with abi, two with ag <dig>  and one with geh, display changes in the opposite direction when compared to the rt <dig> profiler pcr array. bag <dig> exhibits a fold change of  <dig>  with pcr arrays but a fold change of - <dig>  with afx while the other platforms indicate the gene to be similarly expressed in both rna samples with a minimal fold change from - <dig>  to  <dig> . cdk5r <dig> and igfbp <dig> are shown to be discordant between abi and pcr arrays, with the directions of fold-change observed by abi for these two genes to be opposite to those reported by all other platforms. abcd <dig> and bag <dig> are discordant within the five microarray platforms while the three quantitative platforms that have measured these two genes, the rt <dig> profiler pcr array, taqman and quantigene, show fold-change values in a uniform direction. jak <dig> displays a fold change of - <dig>  by ag <dig> but  <dig>  by pcr arrays. all other platforms show the same direction of fold-change as pcr arrays; however, like ag <dig>  all of them indicate no significant difference in jak <dig> expression between the two rna samples with a fold change smaller than two.

discussion
although sybr geen pcr is a popular gene expression technique used by about half of the real-time pcr users, it was surprisingly not evaluated in the maqc study. therefore, in this study, we have assessed the performance of sybr green rt <dig> profiler pcr arrays and compared our expression profiling results of those two reference samples with the maqc results obtained from three other traditional quantitative platforms including taqman assays, quantigene and start-pcr as well as five commercial microarrays.

the present study demonstrates sybr green rt <dig> profiler pcr arrays to be a quantitative platform with high inter-run and inter-laboratory reproducibility. the average cv for the ct values generated from all assays on the custom pcr array is found to be  <dig> % with replicate measurements for ct values below  <dig> within  <dig>  cycle average standard deviation, demonstrating a good inter-run reproducibility. when compared with the results from the other three quantitative platforms studied in the maqc study , the transformed data based on the corresponding universal maqc scale give a median cv for all assays on pcr arrays of  <dig> % and that for assays detecting >  <dig> transcript copies of  <dig> %. these respective values were reported to be  <dig> % and  <dig> % for taqman,  <dig> % and  <dig> % for start-pcr, and  <dig> % and  <dig> % for quantigene  <cit> . as seen with taqman assays and start-pcr  <cit> , a trend of increasing cv and sd is observed with increasing ct values  which is attributable to the stochastic nature of the sample loading of transcript molecules which influences the magnitude of cv  <cit> . high level of inter-site reproducibility is also demonstrated for sybr green pcr arrays by inter-site comparison of ct values and fold-change results leading to correlation coefficients of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

results obtained from sybr green pcr arrays show that  <dig> out of the  <dig> selected genes  are considered to be present in both samples a and b, which is similar to the values reported in the maqc study for the detection sensitivity of the other three quantitative platforms  <cit> . eighty-six percent , 94% and 91% of the tested genes were above the respective lod of the taqman assay , start-pcr  and quantigene  in both samples a and b  <cit> . the assay range of pcr arrays is  <dig>  on a log <dig> scale, which is comparable to the assay range of  <dig>  for taqman assay reported in the maqc project  <cit>  and wider than those of the other two quantitative platforms in the maqc study, with start-pcr and quantigene having an assay range of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively  <cit> .

cross-platform comparisons of gene profiling results of the two maqc reference rna samples illustrate a remarkably good correlation between sybr green rt <dig> profiler pcr arrays and other technologies tested in the maqc studies. specifically, pcr arrays and the other two pcr-based methods, taqman and start-pcr, exhibit an exceedingly high concordance with values for their correlation coefficients and linear slopes close to  <dig>  this result demonstrates that these three methods report very similar fold changes in gene expression between the two maqc samples. although high correlation coefficients are observed between pcr arrays and the hybridization-based techniques such as quantigene and the microarrays, the values for the linear slope are lower, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . these results are consistent with a compression effect on log <dig> fold change computed from the hybridization-based techniques which was also observed when comparisons between taqman pcr and quantigene or microarray platforms were made in the maqc studies  <cit> .

sybr green real-time pcr arrays demonstrate a good concordance in the differentially expressed gene list with the three quantitative technologies and five microarray platforms examined in the maqc projects. great overlaps in the list of degs are noted for pcr arrays and taqman as well as the other quantitative platforms, ranging from 81% to 93%. the list of degs generated by pcr arrays is also highly comparable with the five microarray platforms, with overlaps ranging from 73% to 90%. however, disparities in the expression results are observed for two genes between pcr arrays and quantitative platforms, and for six genes in addition to rb <dig> between pcr arrays and the five microarray platforms . one possible cause for the disparities was experimentally investigated and found due to the accuracy of sequence information provided by the ncbi refseq database. as the design of the primers and probes for gene expression measurement is usually based on the gene sequence information from the refseq and non-refseq databases, any inaccuracies in those databases or the presence of previously unknown snps or splice variants, will potentially affect the accuracy of the assays. this scenario was clearly illustrated by the sybr green assay for rb <dig> gene in this study where the discovery of a two-base mismatch in one of the rb <dig> primers was made with the current refseq accession. since the refseq database is frequently being updated to improve the accuracy of its gene sequence information, it is important to have the sequences of the primers and probes checked periodically against the most updated version of the refseq database in order to ensure the accuracy of the assays.

because we have limited access to the information on the exact sequences of the primers and probes used by other technologies and platforms, it is difficult to investigate further all of the potential causes of the discordances between platforms by performing experiments. another possible explanation for the discordance may be due to a difference in the interrogative regions  <cit> . the maqc study provides the information on the approximate regions being probed in individual assays for all tested platforms in the form of the distance from the most 3' location of each assay to the 3' end of the gene  <cit> . comparisons of the detection regions between different technologies are listed in table  <dig> and shown in figure  <dig>  furin is found to be differentially expressed by taqman assays  <cit>  but not by other platforms; this appears to be due to a difference in the regions being probed, with the taqman assay interrogating a region that is closer to the 5' end of the gene than those of other platforms  <cit>  . the same explanation could also be suggested for rb <dig>  jak <dig>  bag <dig> and bag <dig>  for rb <dig> and jak <dig>  the locations being probed for pcr arrays are closer to the 5' end of these genes than those of other platforms. similarly, the discordance against other technologies in the fold-change results for bag <dig> with afx, and bag <dig> with abi and ag <dig>  might be due to the fact that these platforms interrogate a region closer to the 3' end of these two genes than all other platforms.

the most 3' interrogative locations of the above assays are indicated by the distance to the 3' end of the corresponding gene. the probing locations of the assays for technologies other than rt <dig> profiler pcr arrays are available from the supplementary information provided by the maqc study  <cit> . assays with discordant results compared to those of pcr arrays are underlined and in bold.

the discrepancies in the expression results for the remaining three genes  cannot simply be explained by the difference in probe locations. interestingly, while these three genes display discordance among the microarray platforms, all four quantitative platforms show comparable results. this has led to the suggestion that disagreements between microarray platforms may be due to cross-hybridization of the probes on the arrays with other targets  <cit> . as in the case of rb <dig>  the underlying reason for the discordance caused by different detection regions among technologies and platforms may be associated with the degree of accuracy in the sequence information being varied at different regions due to the continuous discoveries of previously unknown snps and spliced variants. hence, even if the primers or probes from different platforms recognize the same region, there is a possibility that they may detect different spliced variants or transcripts with different snps. again, frequently updating the primer and probe design with the most updated releases of refseq and non-refseq databases is essential for the success of all of these technologies.

disagreements between different platforms may also arise from low detection signals for some genes. among the discordant genes noted in table  <dig>  bag <dig> and cdk5r <dig> are considered by all the five microarray platforms to be either absent or having relatively low expression in at least one of the two rna samples. this trend with discordance occurring more frequently with low expressers was also noted in the maqc study  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, sybr green real-time pcr arrays produce gene profiling differences between the two maqc reference rna samples that are highly concordant with those generated by other quantitative gene expression analysis and microarray platforms. pcr arrays deliver results comparable to those of high-density microarrays. moreover, it yields results similar to those of taqman gene expression assays, a widely accepted method for validating microarray results, and other more complicated and more expensive quantitative methods tested by the maqc project. hence, sybr green pcr array is a quantitative platform suitable for microarray data validation.
