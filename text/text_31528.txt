BACKGROUND
microarray analyses have been used to link changes at the level of gene expression to different kidney diseases to obtain markers for diagnosis and prognosis. microarray analyses of human patients have been used to analyze post-transplant events  <cit> . a recent review of microarray-based studies and the search for biomarkers in organ transplantation is given by kurian et al.  <cit> . microarray analysis of kidney transplant biopsies with acute rejection identified gene expression patterns that distinguish three distinct subtypes of acute rejection that, although indistinguishable by histology, were marked by differences in mechanisms of immune activation and cell proliferation  <cit> . interestingly, another study of acute rejection biopsies showed no evidence for up-regulation of cytotoxic t-cell effector molecules despite the fact that these have been considered markers for acute renal rejection  <cit> . in parallel, gene expression signatures of peripheral blood lymphocytes  from transplant patients have also been shown to be capable of classifying patients with acute rejection  <cit> . surprisingly, there was essentially no overlap in rejection-diagnostic genes up-regulated in pbl and genes up-regulated in the biopsies from the same patients, indicating that the blood must be considered a very different immune compartment in this setting. as a consequence of these initial studies, the hope of developing validated diagnostic biomarkers for transplantation is tempered by results that challenge an existing dogma on immune response mechanisms and demand additional studies to deconvolute.

there are a number of limitations inherent in clinical studies of gene expression in transplantation. patients typically represent major differences in gender, age, co-morbidities, clinical histories, immunosuppressive regimes, race/ethnicities, and genetics and it is always difficult to collect samples at specific times relative to the procedures. these differences significantly influence gene expression and that operant variability compromises the results obtained by microarray analysis as well as the confidence to identify the principal underlying immune mechanisms. the use of experimental transplantation models in rats or mice is an opportunity to mitigate these variables and work in a controlled system. several studies have made use of experimental transplantation to study changes in gene expression related to acute rejection after murine heart, kidney and lung transplantation  <cit> . while several studies have been performed using heart transplantation in rats  <cit> , to our knowledge, a study of acute kidney transplant rejection in rats has not been reported.

in previous studies  <cit> , we showed in well characterized rat renal transplantation models, no evidence of tissue necrosis at day  <dig> while histological changes consistent with acute rejection including activated lymphocyte infiltration were found consistently. in those studies we showed differences in gene expression for selected sodium and water transporters that were relevant to tissue injury and renal compensation. in the present study, we made use of these transplantation models and continued our studies using day  <dig> as the measuring point to represent a time at which there is full representation of acute rejection mechanisms but before the widespread renal tissue injury that can confuse the gene signatures. thus, changes in gene expression related solely to acute rejection in allogeneic transplantation or linked to the surgical procedure in syngeneic transplantation can be evaluated. native, untreated kidneys were used as the control group. no immunosuppression was used to specifically analyze the influence of acute rejection on gene expression independent of the effects of immunosuppressive regimens. thereby, maximum homogeneity in procedures, sample preparation, timing, and handling was achieved. in contrast to the design of renal transplantation studies performed in mice  <cit> , we used bilaterally nephrectomized recipient rats, such that the animal's transplant was required to maintain the full metabolic and synthetic function of the organism as is the case in the clinical transplant situation.

RESULTS
correlation and clustering of the samples
the global experiment structure was inspected utilizing different methods intended to validate whether the groups were homogeneous and whether the within-group variance was smaller than the between-group variance. furthermore, group distances could be roughly estimated. the correlations within the "acute group" , "syngeneic group"  and "control group"  showed a homogenous correlation of  <dig> – <dig>  . the correlation between the control group and the syngeneic group was  <dig> – <dig> , between control and the acute group was  <dig> – <dig> , and between the acute group and the syngeneic group was  <dig> – <dig> . the representative scatter plots of all genes between different samples showed that the observed correlations are not dominated by a small number of highly expressed genes . the syngeneic group was more similar to the control group than the acute group was to the control group. thus, the processes of acute rejection were the most relevant factors in driving the observed changes in gene expression.

identification of differentially expressed genes
significantly regulated and differentially expressed genes were identified using class comparisons as implemented in brb arraytools for all the possible group comparisons . genes with a parametric p value <  <dig>  were classified as significantly differentially expressed . thus,  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated for the acute group compared to the control. comparison of the acute to the syngeneic group revealed  <dig> genes were up- and  <dig> genes were down-regulated. in contrast, comparing the control to syngeneic groups for the impact of the transplant surgery revealed  <dig> genes were down-regulated and  <dig> were up-regulated. the venn diagram in figure 2b shows the overlap between the lists of significantly altered genes as a function of the three experimental groups. for further analysis we used the gene lists from syngeneic transplants compared to controls and from allogeneic transplants compared to controls. specifically, we decided not to report on our comparison of the allogeneic transplants to the syngeneic transplants because the results of the functional and pathway analysis were nearly identical with the results obtained using the comparison of allogeneic transplants with controls. there were marginal differences in the number of genes related to a distinct function or pathway. however, the complete output files with all regulated genes are provided as additional file  <dig> 

genes with protective or regulatory properties up-regulated after allogeneic transplantation like ho- <dig> , bcl2a <dig> , c4bpa , il <dig>  or members of a gene family that were highly induced like timp <dig> , mmp <dig> , tap1/ <dig>  were analyzed by real time pcr . foxp <dig> and cd <dig> are expressed by regulatory t-cells  <cit> . the results for expression of genes that were not significantly regulated after syngeneic transplantation according to the array were set to  <dig>  the pcr results confirmed the up-regulated genes after allogeneic transplantation identified by the expression arrays. the changes in expression varied between 10-fold for tap <dig> up to ~500-fold for c4bp. it is important to note that there is no corresponding probe set on the rat  <dig>  <dig>  microarray for foxp <dig>  therefore the foxp <dig> was also chosen for real-time pcr analysis. interestingly the expression of foxp <dig> was highly induced after allogeneic transplantation .

the genes analyzed by real time pcr were not identified to be differently expressed after syngeneic transplantation compared to control. however, the real time pcr results showed up-regulated expression of mmp <dig>  and c4bp  after syngeneic transplantation.

genes involved in immune response
a selection of transcripts determined to be up-regulated as a function of acute rejection is shown in table  <dig>  the recruitment of cells related to the immune response is indicated by up-regulation of cd <dig> , the marker for cytotoxic t-cells and by the up-regulation of granzyme-a , granzyme-b  and perforin , cytotoxic effector molecules released by cd8+ t-cells. evidence for the involvement and activation of macrophages is the elevated expression of cd <dig>  the marker for macrophages  <cit>  and ficolin b, which is expressed by activated macrophages  <cit> .

t-cells and macrophages release factors like cytokines for differentiation and proliferation and chemokines for recruitment of other immunologically active cells. thus, the expression pattern of cytokines and chemokines like cxcl <dig>  xcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> or ccl <dig> shown in table  <dig> is consistent with their well established importance in the signaling mechanisms activated after allogeneic transplantation .

functional annotation using gene ontology terms
to identify activated or suppressed functions, the lists of significantly up- or down-regulated genes after syngeneic transplantation and allogeneic transplantation were analyzed to identify over-represented go-terms. the third go-level gives the best compromise between specificity and list coverage  <cit> . after syngeneic transplantation,  <dig> go-terms were enriched in the up-regulated and  <dig> in the down-regulated group of genes on go-level  <dig>  we also analyzed over-represented go-terms without filtering on the third level. table  <dig> shows the ten most significant over-represented genes related to biological process , cellular component  and molecular function . due to the limitation of space the complete lists are also provided with this manuscript .

decreased expression of metabolism-related genes after syngeneic transplantation suggests the suppression of bp-related genes. increased expression of genes related to "cell proliferation" and "cell cycle" within the bp category, "extra cellular matrix" and "collagen" within the cc category and "collagen binding" within the mf category reveal the activation of tissue injury recovery mechanisms related to the transplant surgery itself.

after allogeneic transplantation,  <dig> go-terms were significantly enriched in the up-regulated and  <dig> in the down-regulated genes on go-level  <dig>  without the application of any filter,  <dig> go-terms were enriched in the up- and  <dig> in the down-regulated set of genes. table  <dig> shows the ten most significant over-represented genes related to bp, cc and mf. as expected, the increased expression of genes related to the bp categories "immune response", "defense response" and the cc category "t-cell receptor complex" and the mf category called "cytokine binding" indicates the activation of the immune response. these go-terms are consistent with infiltration of the graft by t-cells and describe signaling mechanisms involved in activation, differentiation and recruitment of immune cells. the bp 'cell death' group describes the downstream processes following t-cell activation. the decreased expression of genes related to the bp categories "metabolism", "transport", "excretion" and the mf category "primary active transporter activity" indicates the challenges posed to the graft to maintain renal function. a major part of renal function is mediated by several transporters and transport systems all primarily or secondarily coupled to energy consumption. the down-regulation of genes that are involved in metabolism or transport leads to a decreased tubular function of the kidney.

pathways affected after syngeneic and allogeneic transplantation
the functional annotation with david identified pathways related to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes   <cit>  that were affected after syngeneic or allogeneic transplantation. the pathways affected after syngeneic transplantation are listed in table  <dig>  the majority of down-regulated genes are related to metabolism pathways. increased expression of genes involved in "cell cycle" and "extra cellular matrix -receptor interaction" are suggestive of active recovery processes following the surgery.

pathways with enrichment of down- or up-regulated genes after allogeneic transplantation are listed in table  <dig>  the majority of the pathways with down-regulated genes are also related to metabolism. in all cases the numbers of genes related to metabolism pathways were higher after allogeneic than syngeneic transplantation indicating a stronger suppression of these pathways in the context of acute rejection. but some pathways, however, were affected only after allogeneic transplantation, like 'oxidative phosphorylation', 'citrate cycle' or 'metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome p450' indicating an acute rejection mediated down-regulation of genes related to these pathways. the majority of pathways with enrichment in up-regulated genes can be directly or indirectly linked to the immune response.

to illustrate the pathways activated by acute rejection related to the immune response, we used ipa to map networks of up- and down-regulated genes after allogeneic transplantation to functional pathways for antigen-presentation , tcr-signaling , apoptosis , ifnγ  and complement cascades . within the antigen processing and presentation pathway nearly all genes were affected . the immunoproteasome alters the activity of the proteasome by replacement of the β <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig> subunits of the 20s core proteasome by lmp <dig>  lmp <dig> and psmb <dig>  <cit> . the expression of these subunits was strongly induced by acute rejection. the antigens processed by the proteasome are transported by molecules associated with the antigen processing  complex  <cit> . thus, we saw strong induction of tap <dig>  and tap <dig> .

the recognition of allogeneic mhc by the t-cell's cognate antigen receptor  will induce activation signals and transcriptional activity . the gene expression changes indicate an induction of nfatc <dig> and nf-κb related pathways. within these pathways, genes with counter regulatory properties like ctla- <dig> or cbl were also up-regulated.

fig.  <dig> illustrates the signaling pathway for ifnγ. ifnγ acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine with altered expression after allogeneic transplantation . nearly all the genes within this pathway showed altered expression in the setting of acute rejection. the expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription   <dig> and stat  <dig>  the downstream effectors of ifnγ signaling, was highly induced. but the increased expression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling   <dig> and of the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type  <dig> , both negative regulators of ifnγ signaling, indicate the simultaneous activation of regulatory mechanisms to limit the ifnγ signaling.

potential novel markers for acute rejection
several genes in the list of up-regulated genes after allogeneic transplantation might serve as novel markers for acute rejection . one candidate is the ets transcription factor, spic . spi-c is expressed during b-lymphocyte development and in activated macrophages  <cit> . spi-c also interacts with stat <dig> promoting il <dig> dependent ige expression  <cit> . no elevated expression level of il <dig> and only a marginal up-regulation of stat <dig> after allogeneic transplantation were found so that the function of spi-c remains unclear. phospholipase-a <dig>  group iid  and phospholipase-a <dig>  group iia  have been shown to be up-regulated in human broncho-epithelial and nasal epithelial cells after treatment with ifnγ  <cit> . the authors postulated a possible involvement of both in cytokine-mediated inflammation.

discussion
the mhc antigens are the main barrier for an acceptance of the graft by the host organism and antigen presentation is essential for the activation of t-cells. t-cells are activated when the tcr recognizes allo-mhc class i molecules in the case of cd8+ and mhc class ii molecules in the case of cd4+ t-cells  <cit> . host t-cells can recognize mhc antigens by either indirect or direct presentation  <cit> . during indirect presentation, peptides derived from donor mhc class i or mhc class ii molecules are processed and presented to cd4+ t-cells by host antigen presenting cells expressing the recipient's mhc class ii molecules. the direct antigen presentation pathway is unique to transplantation. in this pathway the t-cell receptors directly recognize an intact mhc molecule expressed on donor cells. in this context, it is important that for our studies with acute rejection, nearly all the genes associated with the antigen processing and presentation pathways were affected .

our data also indicates that t-cell cytotoxicity is the main immunological pathway activated in response to acute rejection in allogeneic transplantation. the cytotoxic molecules are perforin/granzyme for cd8+ t-cells and the fas/fas-ligand system for cd4+ t-cells  <cit> . in this context, the absolute changes in expression of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation by mhc class i molecules indicates that this part of the antigen presentation is intensely up-regulated. that is also consistent with the up-regulation of the immunoproteasome and tap1/ <dig> transcripts  likely to be driven by the up-regulation of interferon γ  <cit> , which we have also documented. ifnγ can also induce the expression of the chemokines, cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig>  <cit> . these data are consistent with other studies showing the changes in gene expression related to ifnγ or cytotoxic t lymphocytes in murine transplantation models  <cit> .

the induction of tolerance to the graft would be the treatment of choice after transplantation. increased expression of protective genes like metallothionein- <dig> or α2β- crystallin were reported with a mouse cardiac transplant model  <cit> . in this same context, we observed increased expression of a number of genes known to have protective or regulatory properties  creating a much more comprehensive list than reported in any previous studies. our study also indicates the endogenous activation of counter regulatory mechanisms within several pathways that have been linked to acute rejection. for example, genes with anti- apoptotic functions include b-cell leukemia/lymphoma  <dig> related protein a <dig>   and the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins   <cit> . the expression of heme oxygenase  <dig>  was induced after allogeneic transplantation. the expression of ho <dig> can suppress graft rejection and leads to long term graft survival in some models  <cit> . the cytotoxic t-lymphocyte-associated protein  <dig>  is a negative regulator of t-cells   <cit> . the function of il <dig> is to limit the action of the immune response. il <dig> was initially characterized as a cytokine produced by th2-cells, which inhibited the production of cytokines such as il <dig>  tnfα and ifnγ  <cit> . il <dig> also modulates the expression of chemokines, chemokine receptors and mhc class ii molecules  <cit> . thus, the induction of il <dig> after allogeneic transplantation indicates a possible feed back mechanism of the immune response .

the complement system is part of the innate immune response. the expression profile we demonstrate in allogeneic transplants for a number of complement components indicates the activation of the complement cascade by acute rejection . its major function is the elimination of pathogens and the stimulation of an inflammatory response  <cit> . local gene expression for complement components has been shown for c <dig> and c <dig> during acute rejection in kidney and heart transplantation models, respectively  <cit> . one of the novel genes in our study with the strongest expression after allogeneic transplantation was the c4b binding protein alpha . c4bpa is a cofactor for factor  <dig> in the degradation of c4b in the complement cascade  <cit> . the degradation of c4b inhibits the formation of the c4b2a complex, a key step in producing an inflammatory response  <cit> .

recently regulatory t-cells have been recognized as a promising tool for the induction of tolerance  <cit> . in these studies of our rat renal transplants we also find transcriptional evidence for the presence of regulatory t-cells within the graft. the function of regulatory t-cells is to regulate or suppress the activation, regulation and function of effector t-cells  <cit> . the development of regulatory t-cells appears to be controlled by foxp <dig>  <cit> , which we find is up-regulated after allogeneic transplantation . the intragraft expression of foxp <dig> has also been demonstrated in cardiac allograft patients  <cit> . the presence of regulatory t-cells within the grafts we studied is further supported by the concomitant increase in expression of cd <dig>  <cit>  and tryptophan hydroxylase  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have used a well-defined rat kidney transplantation model to demonstrate global changes in gene expression levels after syngeneic and allogeneic transplantation with the emphasis on early acute rejection in the allogeneic transplants. using dna microarrays and real time pcr analysis, we were able to identify major immune effector-related pathways that are activated after allogeneic transplantation and clearly linked by multiple lines of published evidence to acute rejection mechanisms of tissue injury. that we also found a list of genes that are equally highly differentially expressed in acute rejection but not presently linked in the literature represents opportunities for additional studies and discovery. in parallel, we have also identified a number of up-regulated genes that are linked to tissue protective and immune counter-regulation mechanisms. these observations fit with the evolving view of immunity as a balance between effector and regulatory mechanisms.
