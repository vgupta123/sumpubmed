BACKGROUND
atractylodes lancea, a member of the compositae family, is a traditional
chinese medicinal plant  <cit> . volatile oils from a. lancea show antimicrobial
activities as well. these oils comprise active secondary metabolites, including the
characteristic components atractylone, β-eudesmol, hinesol, and atractylodin
 <cit> . secondary metabolites, such as
terpenes, flavonoids, and alkaloids, are believed to be involved in plant responses
to many biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . another plant defense response
is the activation of multiple signaling events  <cit> . for example, jasmonic acid  biosynthesis by
plants is induced by pathogen infection and elicitor treatment  <cit> , and salicylic acid  is involved in
activating distinct sets of defense-related genes  <cit> , such as those that encode pathogenesis-related 
proteins  <cit> . also, many signaling
molecules have been revealed to be involved in secondary metabolism  <cit> .

endophytes can coexist with their hosts and have great potential to affect the
hosts’ metabolism  <cit> ; their effects
on plant accumulation of medicinal components have received much attention recently
 <cit> .
unlike pathogens, endophytic fungi do not cause strong hypersensitive reactions in
the host. but long-term colonization can induce various kinds of metabolites to
accrue in hosts  <cit> . how endophytic fungus-host interactions affect the
accumulation of plant secondary metabolites is an intriguing issue.

jasmonic acid is a well-characterized plant signaling molecule that mediates plant
defense responses  <cit>  by responding to
microbial infection and elicitor treatment  <cit> . kunkel et al.. <cit>  found that fungal elicitor caused rapid increases in ja
production, secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene expression, and secondary
metabolite accumulation in many plants. exogenous ja application enhanced gene
expression of secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways, while the fungal
elicitor-induced secondary metabolite accumulation could be abolished by ja
synthesis inhibitors  <cit> . most plant
defense responses are regulated by many signal molecules, and
“cross-talk” among multiple signaling pathways is important in plant
cell signal transduction networks  <cit> . an
increasing number of studies have shown that these signals do not function entirely
independently; rather, they are influenced the magnitude or amplitude of various
other signals  <cit> .

although interactions between sa- and ja-mediated signaling pathways have been
reported to enhance the expression of plant defense-related genes, studies on
interactions between ja and multiple signaling pathways  in mediating plant secondary metabolite accumulation are rare. in
this work, we report that ja acts as a downstream signal of nitric oxide - and
hydrogen peroxide -mediated volatile oil accumulation in
a. lancea plantlets induced by endophytic fungus gilmaniella
sp. al <dig>  furthermore, we reveal an unusual complementary relationship between ja
and sa in mediating the biosynthesis of medicinal plant secondary metabolites.

application of signaling molecules or fungal inoculation.

fungal culture and treatments
the endophytic fungus al <dig>  was isolated from a.
lancea, cultured on potato dextrose agar, and incubated at 28°c
for five days  <cit> . thirty-day-old
plantlets were inoculated using 5-mm al <dig> mycelial disks. an equal size of
potato dextrose agar was used as a control. all treatments were conducted in a
sterile environment and replicated at least three times to examine
reproducibility.

measurement of h2o <dig> and no
thirty-day-old plants were incubated with fungal mycelia disks with or without

 <dig>  mmol l- <dig> cptio,  <dig>  mkat l- <dig> cat or
3 mmol l- <dig> dpi.

the generation of h2o <dig> by a. lancea plantlets was
measured by chemiluminescence in a ferricyanide-catalyzed oxidation of luminol
according to schwacke and hager  <cit> ,
with modification. leaf samples  were ground with 5 ml double
distilled water. the homogenate was centrifuged at  <dig>  g for
10 min, then 100 μl supernatant, 50 μl luminol

with 100 μl k3[fe <dig>  to compare independent
experiments, we used h2o <dig> as an internal standard. fifty
microliters of h2o <dig>

buffer. one unit of h2o <dig> was defined as the
chemiluminescence caused by the internal standard of 1 μm
h2o <dig> per gram fresh weight.

the generation of no was monitored using a no detection kit  according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. leaf samples  were ground with 5 ml of
40 mm 4--1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid  and the
homogenate was centrifuged at  <dig>  g for 10 min. the supernatant
was used for the no assays. one unit of no was defined as the absorbance
variation caused by the internal standard of 1 μm no per gram fresh
weight.

 <dig>  mmol l- <dig> aip.

salicylic acid was extracted followed the method of verberne et al.
 <cit> , with some modifications.
five grams of whole plantlets was ground in liquid nitrogen and extracted in
2 ml methanol by sonication. after centrifugation at  <dig>  g for
5 min, the supernatant was rotary evaporated, and the residue was
resuspended in 250 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid. the mixture was
re-extracted with 800 μl acetic acid ester: cyclohexane
. finally, the organic phase was rotary evaporated until dry,
dissolved with 600 μl hplc mobile phase , and filtered with a  <dig> -μm
microporous membrane for determination.

the sa samples were quantified by hplc using a reverse-phase column . the mobile
phases flow rate was 1 ml min− <dig>  salicylic acid was
detected at 217 nm at 25°c  <cit> .

extraction and determination of volatile oils and ja
thirty-day-old plantlets of atractylodes lancea were incubated with 5-mm
mycelial disks or pda disks . inhibitors
 were added  <dig> d before
fungal inoculation for ja determination.

volatile oils were extracted from whole plantlets of a. lancea,
including leaves and rhizomes , according to zhang et al.  <cit> . the volatile oils were dried with anhydrous sodium
sulfate and stored in dark glass bottles at 4°c for gas chromatograph 
analysis.

following juergen et al.  <cit> , ja was
extracted by grinding plant material  frozen in liquid nitrogen and
extracting with h2o: acetone . samples were store in dark
glass bottles at −21°c for gc analysis.

gc determination was carried out using an  <dig> series gc  equipped with a flame ionization detector. a db-5 ms

column  was used with the following temperature
program: column held at 60°c for 1 min after injection, increased by
10°c/min to 190°c, held for 2 min, increased by 5°c/min to
210°c, held for 2 min, increased by 10°c/min to 220°c, and
held for 8 min. nitrogen was used as carrier and the flow rate was
4 ml/min. four main components of the volatile oils, atractylone, hinesol,
β-eudesmol, and atractylodin, were quantitatively analyzed according to the
method of fang et al.  <cit> ; their
retention times were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  min, respectively.

real-time quantitative rt-pcr analysis
total rna was extracted from leaves as described by dong and beer  <cit> . first-strand cdna was synthesized from
1 μg of total rna . real-time qpcr was performed using the dna engine opticon  <dig> real-time
pcr detection system  and sybr green probe . the constitutively-expressed gene ef1α used
as an internal positive control. the gene-specific primers used to amplify
ef1α were 5′-caggctgattgtgctgttctta-3′ and
5′-tgtggcatccatcttgt-3′  and for
alhmgr were 5′-ggtgagaaaggtcctgaaa-3′ and
5′-catggtaacggagatatgaa-3′ . the genbank accession
numbers of the alhmgr and ef1α genes are ef <dig>  and x <dig> 
respectively.

the thermocycler program was as follows: 90 s at 95°c;  <dig> cycles of
30 s at 95°c, 30 s at 57°c, and 30 s at 72°c;
and 5 min at 72°c. to standardize the data, the ratio of the absolute
transcript level of the alhmgr genes to the absolute transcript level
of ef1α was calculated for each sample of each treatment.

statistical analyses
data were compiled using microsoft excel . the values were
represented as mean ± sd of three replicates for each treatment.
student’s t-test, one-way anova, and duncan’s multiple
range test were used to identify significant differences .

RESULTS
dependence of ja in fungus-induced volatile oil accumulation
the ja contents of the plantlets increased significantly after endophytic fungus
inoculation , indicating that the fungus
may trigger ja biosynthesis in the plantlets. concurrently, the total amount of
volatile oils increased significantly .
both ibu and ndga are inhibitors of the octadecanoid pathway that synthesizes ja
and are usually applied in plant systems as ja-specific inhibitors
 <cit> . to investigate whether ja
was involved in the fungus-induced volatile oil accumulation, ibu and ndga were
applied; as shown in figure 1b, both inhibitors
suppressed not only the fungus-induced ja generation, but also the
fungus-triggered volatile oil production. the results suggested that ja was
important for fungus-induced volatile-oil synthesis in a. lancea
plantlets. however, volatile oils in the a. lancea plantlets treated
with both fungus and ja inhibitors could still accumulate, compared with the
control, even though ja generation was lower than control , implying that fungus-induced volatile oil synthesis is
not solely dependent on the ja signaling pathway.

ja acts as a downstream signal of no and h2o2
pathway
previous results showed that ja is not the sole signaling pathway involved in
fungus-induced volatile oil synthesis; no, h2o <dig>  and sa
are also known to mediate this process in a. lancea plantlets
 <cit> . to investigate a possible
relationships between ja and one or more of these other pathways, a.
lancea plantlets were treated with the no-specific scavenger cptio, the
membrane nadph oxidase inhibitor dpi/cat, the sa inhibitor pac/aip, ibu, and
fungal inoculation. the no scavenger cptio could inhibit ja production in
inoculated plantlets, but ibu could not inhibit no production
, showing that ja may act as a
downstream signal of no. exogenous h2o <dig> could reverse ja
suppression, implying that ja is mediated by no though
h2o <dig> in endophyte-induced volatile-oil accumulation.
in addition, the h2o <dig> inhibitor dpi/cat could inhibit ja
production, but ibu could not inhibit h2o <dig> production with
inoculation . the one-way dependence of
ja on h2o <dig> confirmed that h2o <dig> was
the intermediary factor between ja and no.

experiments. bars with different lower-case letters were significantly
different .

paclobutrazol is an effective sa biosynthesis-related benzoic acid hydroxylase
 inhibitor  <cit>  that also inhibits
gibberellin biosynthesis  <cit> .
therefore, we also used aip, a specific sa biosynthesis-related phenylalanine
ammonialyase  inhibitor  <cit> , to confirm that sa generation was suppressed.
interestingly, pac and aip could abolish the suppression of ja by dpi/cat with
fungus inoculation . this result implied
that the sa and ja signaling pathways were closely linked in endophyte-induced
volatile-oil accumulation in a. lancea plantlets.

complementary interactions between ja and sa in fungus-induced volatile-oil
accumulation
to further investigate the relationship between ja and sa, gradient
concentrations of the ja-inhibiter ibu and the sa-inhibitors pac and aip were
applied. as shown in figure  <dig>  the fungus-induced ja
level of the plantlets decreased gradually as ibu concentration increased, but
both sa accumulation and volatile oil content were enhanced as well, although
the amounts did not exceed those obtained with fungal inoculation alone.
similarly, sa levels in plantlets were inhibited by  <dig> ,  <dig>  and
 <dig>  mmol l- <dig> aip and by
3 mmol l- <dig> pac, whereas ja was enhanced significantly
. volatile oil accumulation was
enhanced by  <dig>  mmol l- <dig> aip and
3 mmol l- <dig> pac . the results suggested that ja may have a complementary interaction
with sa to mediate fungal endophyte-induced volatile-oil accumulation. however,
combining ibu and paclobutrazol could not completely inhibit volatile oil
synthesis. we added the h2o2-inhibitor dpi/cat to ibu and
paclobutrazol, which reduced volatile-oil accumulation to the level of the
control. the results suggested that h2o <dig>  sa, and ja may
work simultaneously in fungus-induced volatile-oil synthesis in a.
lancea plantlets.

discussion
secondary metabolite accumulation is a common plant response to biotic or abiotic
environmental stress, and secondary messengers are widely employed to mediate the
accumulation of plant secondary metabolites. this work demonstrated that the fungus
gilmaniella sp. can induce ja production and promote the accumulation
of volatile oils in host plantlets. as an important signal molecule, ja plays key
roles in regulating the induction of volatile oils by the endophytic fungus. the
specific inhibitors ibu and ndga could block the ja signaling pathway and reduce the
accumulation of related metabolites. our previous study showed that no,
h2o <dig>  and sa acted as signal molecules to mediate the
accumulation of volatile oils in suspension cells of a. lancea caused by
endophytic fungal elicitor  <cit> . thus, the
possible relationships between ja and other known signaling pathways in the
accumulation of secondary metabolites were further investigated.

cross-talk between different signal transduction pathways, as opposed to single
signaling pathways, mediates gene expression and the production of secondary
metabolites during plant defense responses  <cit> . hydrogen peroxide has been reported to be a
possible upstream signal for no production in mung bean plantlets  <cit> . nitric oxide also can mediated fungal
elicitor-induced taxol biosynthesis in taxus chinensis suspension cells
through reactive oxygen signaling pathways, stimulate sa accumulation in tobacco
cell cultures, and induce pal expression via an sa independent pathway
 <cit> . moreover, our previous work demonstrated that no
mediates volatile oil accumulation induced by the fungus through sa- and
h2o2-dependent pathways. hydrogen peroxide can enhance sa
production but does not act as upstream signal molecule  <cit> . the present work showed that endophytic fungus-induced
ja was directly mediated by h2o <dig> and acted as a downstream
signal molecule for both h2o <dig> and no pathways.

in our study, ja had an unusual complementary interaction with the sa signaling
pathway. jasmonic acid is commonly postulated to act antagonistically on the sa
signaling pathway and on the expression of sa-dependent genes  <cit> . other studies have
shown that sa is a potent suppressor of ja signaling pathways and ja-dependent
defense gene expression in various pharmacological and genetic experiments
 <cit> . in
addition, both ja and sa are important signaling molecules in plant defense
responses, such as the activation of distinct sets of defense-related genes and the
development of systemic acquired resistance  <cit> . our results showed that when ja biosynthesis
was suppressed by the inhibitor ibu, accumulation of sa was enhanced to compensate
for the loss of ja-mediating function in fungus-triggered volatile-oil production.
similarly, ja production/signaling could substitute for the sa pathway when sa
accumulation was impaired.

CONCLUSIONS
the value of medicinal herbs relies mainly on the accumulation of active
pharmaceutical ingredients; low yield is the main challenge to producing
high-quality herbs. in this work, we demonstrated that ja acts as a downstream
signaling molecule in no- and h2o2-mediated volatile oil
accumulation induced by endophytic fungus and has a complementary interaction with
the sa signaling pathway and clarified that hmgr gene expression was significantly
stimulated by ja along with increasing sesquiterpenoid components. this information
will help to better understand the relationships between fungal endophytes and their
host plants. furthermore, it also suggests strategies to improve the quality of
medicinal herbs.
