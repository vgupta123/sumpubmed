BACKGROUND
the use of forest trees as a sustainable environmental resource has underscored the importance of genomics in aiding the genetic modification of trees for preferable performance and the development of dna markers for selective breeding. in this context, the development of the genomic resources of populus has gained increasing importance because these species have a small genome  when compared to other tree species. for example, international groups of researchers have determined the nucleotide sequence of the entire genome of the black cottonwood   <cit> . but because the sexual reproduction span of populus is long, it has proven to be an unsuitable model for forward genetics like mutant-based studies. reverse genetic approaches based on the functional genomics are therefore essential. as one of important tools, populus ests have been collected  <cit> . the publicly available est collections of populus including poplar, aspen, cottonwood and their hybrids have already grown to  <dig>   <cit> .

full-length cdna resources are very useful, not only for gene annotation and the determination of transcriptional start sites, but also for functional analyses  <cit> , especially when analyzed within the context of genomic sequences. various methods have been developed that allow preferential cloning of cdna that corresponds to full-length mrnas that have 5'-proximal cap structures  <cit> . these methods have been applied to large-scale analyses of transcripts from human  <cit> , mouse  <cit> , fruit fly  <cit> , rice  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> , and moss  <cit> . although population of populus est has grown steadily, the ests may appear not to be from full-length cdnas to a large extent. recently, populus ets has been tried to obtain from a full-length enriched cdna library constructed by the method of the oligo-capping  <cit>  or the biotinylated cap trapper  <cit> . in the study we report herein, we constructed a full-length enriched cdna library from poplar  by using the biotinylated cap-trapper method.

functional annotation of ests that uses integrated prediction tools and proper curation of the results is not only necessary to complete the annotation process but to find actual biological processes. we annotated our p. nigra ests primarily by using the blast program to search the databases of the institute for genomic research   <cit>  and the universal protein resource   <cit> . although 90% of our pnfl clones were identified through these databases, the rest remained functionally unknown. to identify the remaining pnfl clones, we substituted the coding sequences  of p. trichocarpa for pnfl ests. 65% of the substituted cds was able to be described using the blast against the public protein databases. we treated 35% rest with another computational work of a protein domain analysis. resultant domains found in these sequences may provide a critical clue to understand molecules specific in trees and/or p. nigra, a series of such substitutive procedures is somewhat artificial though. furthermore genome-wide analysis of poplar was done using comparative genomics with herbaceous model plants arabidopsis and rice in the present study. we anticipate that the information we gathered in this comparative analysis will make possible global comparisons among plant species by using functional genomics.

RESULTS
quality of the cdna library
we constructed a full-length enriched cdna library  from p. nigra buds, roots, twigs, and stress-treated leaves by using the biotinylated cap-trapper method, together with trehalose-thermoactivated reverse transcriptase  <cit> . this library was named pnfl <dig> after p. nigra full-length cdna library version  <dig>  the quality of the cdna library was evaluated before large-scale sequencing by examining  <dig> randomly selected but representative clones. the mean size of the insert dna was estimated to be about  <dig>  kb  by measuring the length of the pvuii fragments of  <dig> independent clones from among the  <dig> sample clones.

to further estimate the distribution of the insert sizes of the pnfl <dig> clones, we created a histogram showing a length distribution of the p. trichocarpa cds that were substituted for the p. nigra ests.  <dig>  pnfl <dig> nonredundant clones were corresponded to p. trichocarpa's predicted cds under conditions as following: 1) both the 5'-end and 3'-end sequences of each pnfl <dig> clone had to have blastn hit against the p. trichocarpa cds in their proper orientation; 2) e value of the blastn hit had to be less than 1e- <dig> of both the 5'-end and 3'-end sequences; 3) e value of the hit had to be less than 1e- <dig> of the 5'-end or 3'-end sequences. altogether,  <dig>  pnfl <dig> clones satisfied all conditions above. and  <dig>  corresponding p. trichocarpa cds were defined as the substituted cds and used for the histogram. the length of most of the  <dig>   <dig> substituted cds ranged between  <dig>  kbp and  <dig>  kbp .

by comparing the transcripts longer than  <dig>  kbp with the ests contained in the pnfl <dig> library, we found  <dig> corresponding substituted cds. this computational estimation was partially reconfirmed by subjecting  <dig> of the extracted  <dig> -kbp or greater sized clones to electrophoresis . we found that the pnfl population would provide useful resources for populus researchers with well intact molecules.

to analyze the cdna population, on the other hand,  <dig> selected clones were sequenced from their 5'-ends and blastn-searched in the genbank nucleotide database, resulting that  <dig> % of clones contained an insert. clones whose query start position was greater than the hit start position in the aligned region were defined as being full-length. the ratio of full-length clones was calculated as a/, wherein a is the number of full-length clones and b the number of those that are shorter. this calculation yielded a ratio of  <dig> . overall, the duplication rate of the genes in the pnfl <dig> library was substantially lower than that of the pnfl <dig> library  <cit> , most likely because of the normalization process used in the construction of the pnfl <dig> library.

one-pass sequencing of pnfl <dig> clones and integrated clustering of pnfl ests
we randomly selected  <dig>  clones  from the pnfl <dig> cdna library and sequenced them from the 5'-end and the 3' end by using a high-throughput dna sequencing process. we identified  <dig>  clones that had 5'-end-based and/or 3'-end-based ests . the nucleotide sequences of the pnfl <dig> ests have been submitted to the ddbj/embl/genbank  and are provided in additional file  <dig>  these ests were first clustered by using the phrap program, and the phrap-assembled sequences were then subjected to a round-robin blastn search within their own population. through these clustering processes, we obtained  <dig>  tentative contigs and  <dig>  singletons that did not have a partner with pairwise homology either within the total pool of sequences or within a given cluster, representing  <dig>  nonredundant pnfl <dig> clones. we also found that the consensus sequences of  <dig>  tentative contigs and of  <dig>  singletons each covered a whole transcript. for better annotation of populus genes and comparative studies among plant species, complete reading of full-length clones should be important. although our present work did not focus only on completely read cdnas, we obtained those of  <dig> . other group also collected  <dig>  populus cdnas whose sequences were completely read  <cit> . altogether, this information should be valuable in the functional annotation of the populus genome.

when the  <dig>  pnfl <dig> ests  <cit>  were filtered out,  <dig>  pnfl <dig> ests remained. these remaining ests were integrated and assembled into clusters as described in the methods section. for each cluster, we considered the clone that had the longest 5' read among other cluster members to be a cluster representative. this procedure allowed us to eliminate diverse variations in the length of the 5'-untranslated region within each cluster. the resulting population of nonredundant pnfl clones was comprised of cluster representatives and singletons. in total,  <dig>  nonredundant pnfl clones were obtained;  <dig>  were pnfl2-specific,  <dig>  were pnfl1-specific, and  <dig>  were common to both the pnfl <dig> and pnfl <dig> libraries . this population of nonredundant clones corresponds to 44% of the entire populus cds  <cit> .

functional annotation and classification of pnfl ests
we tried to delimit the features of the proteins that the pnfl clones encoded as illustrated in figure  <dig>  both the 5' and 3' reads were first annotated based on searches for homologous sequences in the tigr and uniprot public databases by using the blastx program with each pnfl est as a query against the arabidopsis cds in the tigr arabidopsis thaliana database  <cit> , the rice cds in the tigr rice genome annotation database  <cit> , and the uniprot trembl plant protein database  <cit> . currently, these databases are the authoritative resources for plant protein sequences and functional information.

in these databases searches,  <dig>  pnfl clones hit with an e value of ≤  <dig> e- <dig> . the remaining  <dig>  clones that did not hit  were converted into p. trichocarpa cds, as described above, yielding  <dig>  substituted cds . the three public databases were searched again to determine whether these substituted sequences were homologous to any published sequences. in a separate search performed with the interproscan program  <cit> ,  <dig> substituted clones hit with an e value of ≤  <dig> e- <dig> , and the remaining  <dig> clones  that did not hit are possible candidates for tree-specific  genes or unhopefully genes due to contaminations of total rnas. using the same interproscan program, we defined a protein feature of these  <dig> clones; any domains were found in only  <dig> clones . although this information was derived from artificially substituted cds, descriptions of these hard-to-annotate clones will allow us to interpret the unique nature of populus species.

a substituted p. trichocarpa cds for pnfl ests were subjected to the interproscan program. this table corresponds to 'annotation list c ' in fig.  <dig> 

b pnfl clones whose substitutive sequences have at least one hit are listed.

comparative genomic analysis of pnfl ests
we compared the pnfl ests with an entire set of genes both in arabidopsis and in rice by using the tblastx program as described previously  <cit> . because populus species are dicotyledonous, the e values derived from the comparison with arabidopsis were considerably lower than from the comparison with rice. half of all the predicted proteins of arabidopsis and those of rice matched with respective e values of < 10- <dig> and < 10- <dig> . these results also showed that most arabidopsis and rice genes share a homolog with the pnfl clones to a large extent. consequently, such genome-wide comparative analysis of functional sequences is a powerful tool for achieving a comprehensive understanding of genetic homology among plant species.

putative physical mapping of pnfl ests
for an overview of the distribution of our pnfl clones on the populus genome, our ests were mimically assigned to the p. trichocarpa genome, whose sequences were kindly distributed by the united states department of energy joint genome institute. the tentative genome assignment of the pnfl clones is shown as a physical map of p. trichocarpa chromosomes . this map indicates that our pnfl clones may broadly come from all chromosomes and be distributed on each chromosome without a significant bias .

CONCLUSIONS
full-length cdnas are essential for the correct annotation of genomic sequences and for the functional analysis of genes and their products. collections of full-length cdnas are available in some plant species such as arabidopsis, rice, moss and poplar  <cit> . in poplar, our collection of pnfl cdnas was updated with  <dig>  nonredundant clones. this population represented 44% of the predicted genes in the populus genome. to improve the curation and distribution of this bioresource, all the pnfl cdna clones and their applicable information will be released through riken  <cit> .
