BACKGROUND
in eukaryotes general transcription factors control the activity of rna polymerase ii during initiation and elongation of mrna synthesis. the transcription initiation requires the concerted action of a complex of transcription factors including tfiia, tfiib, tfiid, tfiie, tfiif, and tfiih  <cit> . regulation of transcription is likely to be concerted by additional regulating factors, which are distinct from the general transcription factors in that they are dispensable for basal transcription. cofactors may also be distinct, because some of them do not directly bind dna  <cit> . some cofactors seem to bridge the interaction between gene-specific transcription factors and general transcription factors, whereas others facilitate chromatin remodeling  <cit> .

an improved understanding of transcription requires further elucidation of the rna polymerase ii machinery. several lines of evidence suggest that glioma amplified sequence  <dig>  is associated with the general transcription factor complex. originally, we isolated gas <dig> from a glioblastoma cell line as a nuclear protein containing a c-terminal alpha-acidic activation domain and an n-terminal yeats domain  <cit> . this yeats domain is conserved in the yeats family of transcription factors, including human af <dig>  enl, and the yeast anc1/taf <dig> protein. all of the yeats proteins are components of multi-subunit complexes involved in transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling  <cit> . for instance, taf <dig> is a subunit of tfiid and tfiif, the chromatin remodeling complexes swi/snf, rsc and ino <dig> as well as the histone acetyltransferase complex nua <dig>  <cit> . gas <dig> that shows homology to the n-terminus of taf <dig> interacts with ini <dig>  the human homolog of the swi/snf complex component snf <dig>  <cit> .

furthermore, gas <dig> is a subunit of the human tip <dig> and scrap complexes  <cit> . targeted disruption of the gas <dig> gene in chicken indicates that gas <dig> is required for rna transcription. gas <dig> is suggested to function at the assembly of general transcription initiation complexes at the nuclear matrix  <cit> . we asked whether gas <dig> is also associated with the human general transcription factor complex. we examined the interaction of gas <dig> and tfiif which is a heteromeric tetramer of rap <dig> and rap <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
association of gas <dig> with the general transcription factor tfiif
to analyze whether gas <dig> interacts with tfiif, we recombinantly expressed gst-gas <dig>  purified the fusion protein and confirmed the expression by sds-page. coomassie staining showed a ~ <dig> kda signal corresponding to the combined molecular mass of gst-gas <dig>  immunoblot analysis with gas <dig> antibody also showed a signal of ~ <dig> kda . gst pull-down assay was performed with purified gst-gas <dig> immobilized on glutathion-sepharose matrix. gst-gas <dig> and gst as control were incubated with purified his-rap <dig> and his-rap <dig>  the eluted protein complexes were subjected to immunoblot analysis. both, his-rap <dig> and his-rap <dig> were retained by gst-gas <dig> but not by gst alone . to test for binding of gas <dig> with endogenous tfiif, we performed gst-pull-down assays with hela nuclear extract as source for general transcription factors. immunoblotting confirmed binding of gst-gas <dig> with both rap <dig> and rap <dig> .

binding of gas <dig> to tfiif
to independently confirm the interaction of gas <dig> and tfiif, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. we transiently co-transfected cells with ha-gas <dig> and flag-rap <dig>  immunoblotting of cell extracts showed co-expression of ha-gas <dig> together with flag-rap <dig> . subsequently, cell lysates were incubated either with anti-flag-m <dig> agarose or anti-ha agarose. by flag-immunoprecipitation ha-gas <dig> as well as endogenous gas <dig> was efficiently co-purified in complex with flag-rap <dig>  vice versa, by ha-immunoprecipitation flag-rap <dig> was efficiently co-purified in complex with ha-gas <dig> .

additionally, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments with the endogenous, transcriptionally relevant tfiif complex. therefore, nuclear extracts from hela cells without overexpression of rap <dig> or rap <dig> were subjected to immunoprecipitation using gas <dig> antibodies. immunoblot analysis using rap <dig> and rap <dig> antibodies revealed that endogenous gas <dig> co-immunoprecipitates with endogenous tfiif .

binding of gas <dig> to tfiif: specificity and ionic strength
we analyzed the direct interaction of gas <dig> and the tata binding protein  as well as the rna polymerase ii in vivo. immunoblot analysis revealed no specific binding of tbp to gas <dig>  additionally, there is no direct interaction of gas <dig> and rna polymerase ii . these results provide evidence that the gas <dig> interaction is specific for this particular general transcription factor.

to examine the stability of protein interactions in the gas41/tfiif complex, we analyzed the binding of endogenous rap <dig> to the gst-gas <dig> fusion protein. gst-gas <dig> coupled sepharose was incubated with hela nuclear extract. the bound proteins were washed at increasing salt concentrations. immunoblot analysis showed that nacl concentrations of up to  <dig>  m cause a slight decrease in gas41-rap <dig> interaction. after washing steps with  <dig>  m nacl, rap <dig> is only weakly detectable by immunoblot analysis . these data indicate an ionic component in the interaction between gas <dig> and tfiif.

mapping of the gas <dig> binding region of rap30
to delineate the gas <dig> binding region of rap <dig>  we utilized gst-rap <dig> truncation mutants. in detail, we generated fusion proteins representing the rap <dig> binding domain , the dna binding site  and a fragment covering the rap <dig> binding domain and the polymerase binding domain   <cit> . gst fusion proteins were subjected to pull-down assays using his-gas <dig> as prey. immunoblot analysis revealed the in vitro interaction of gas <dig> with all constructs but d <dig>  these data indicate that gas <dig> interacts with two no-overlapping regions of rap <dig>  covering the polymerase and the dna binding site .

discussion
we described gas <dig> as a potential transcription factor containing an activation and a yeats domain  <cit> . here, we report gas <dig> as a potential cofactor of tfiif. tfiif, consisting of the two subunits rap <dig> and rap <dig>  <cit> , inhibits non-specific transcription initiation by recruiting polymerase ii to the pre-initiation complex  <cit> . this polymerase ii/tfiif complex attaches through direct interactions of tfiif with promoter dna, tfiib and tfiid  <cit> . together with the transcriptional co-activator mediator, it promotes the association of tfiie and tfiih to the pre-initiation complex  <cit> .

gst pull-down assays using recombinant rap <dig> and rap <dig> revealed specific binding of gas <dig> to tfiif in vitro. by using hela nuclear extract, we confirmed these results by demonstrating that both subunits of endogenous tfiif interact with gst-gas <dig>  additionally, we verified the interaction with rap <dig> and rap <dig> in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation. since gas <dig> does not precipitate tbp or rna polymerase ii, gas <dig> appears to preferentially interact with tfiif. although, the interaction of gas <dig> and rap <dig> is resistant to high ionic strength, there is an ionic component to the binding between gas <dig> and rap <dig> 

to further characterize the demonstrated interaction of gas <dig> and tfiif, we expressed full length gst-rap <dig> as well as three truncated rap <dig> mutants. in vitro binding assays revealed direct interaction with all rap <dig> constructs except for the rap <dig> binding site fragment . we mapped the gas <dig> binding site to two non-overlapping regions at the c-terminus of rap <dig>  nevertheless, a single gas <dig> binding site partly overlapping with the dna and polymerase binding site can not be excluded. this binding possibly contributes to a function of gas <dig> in stabilizing the interaction of tfiif and dna.

the function and structure of the rap <dig> and rap <dig> units have been well defined  <cit> . specifically, rap <dig> has been shown to be necessary for pre-initiation complex formation and gene transcription  <cit> . our data suggest that gas <dig> interacts as transcriptional cofactor with the pre-initiation complex via binding to tfiif. in addition to the recently demonstrated role of gas <dig> as co-activator of the sequence-specific transcription factor ap-2Î²  <cit>  and repressor of the p <dig> pathway  <cit> , the interaction with the pre-initiation complex implies a more general function of gas <dig> in cellular transcription. gas <dig> is also described as part of tip <dig> and srcap  <cit> . although gas <dig> is a component of tip <dig>  its function in p <dig> repression is mediated in a tip <dig> independent pathway  <cit> . therefore, we assume that gas <dig> exerts its function in a mechanism which is independent from the chromatin-modifying complexes tip <dig> and srcap.

the association of gas <dig> to the rap <dig> c-terminus possibly contributes to a stabilization of the tfiif-dna interaction. although the functional role of gas <dig> in transcription remains to be fully elucidated, we suggest that gas <dig> as co-factor of the general transcription complex facilitates transcription initiation and bridges the gap to sequence specific transcription by interaction with appropriate transcription factors.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that endogenous gas <dig> directly interacts with endogenous tfiif. we mapped the gas <dig> binding domain to two regions of rap <dig> c-terminus. without in vivo evidence for a binding of gas <dig> to tbp or rna polymerase ii, gas <dig> seems to preferentially bind to tfiif. without a dna-binding domain, gas <dig> appears to be a co-factor of tfiif.
