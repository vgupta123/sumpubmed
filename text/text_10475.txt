BACKGROUND
mycoplasma synoviae is a major poultry pathogen that causes respiratory tract infection and arthritis in chickens and turkeys worldwide  <cit> . m. synoviae infections can lead to a range of diseases, from sub-clinical to severe, cause serious economic losses to the poultry industry due to retarded growth, drop in egg production, poor hatchability, downgrading at slaughter, and increased costs associated with control of the disease  <cit> . once chickens are infected by m. synoviae, they become more vulnerable to other pathogens, such as newcastle disease virus, infectious bursal disease virus, infectious bronchitis virus, escherichia coli and m. meleagridis, thereby further increasing economic losses  <cit> . relevant research on m. synoviae will establish a solid theoretical foundation for further development of vaccines, diagnostic reagents, and therapeutic drugs against m. synoviae infections.

enolase  is an enzyme which catalyzes the reversible interconversion of 2-phosphoglycerate  and phosphoenolpyruvate . studies have shown that enolase has many biological functions, such as its catalytic activity, binding activity with plasminogen  and fibronectin  and it can act as a heat-shock protein  <cit> . aside from its enzymatic activity, the binding activity of surface-exposed enolase of microorganisms to plg and fn can assist pathogenic microorganisms in adhesion to host cells and dissemination within hosts, which potentially playing a role in pathogenesis  <cit> . moreover, as a protective antigen, enolase is also an important potential candidate antigen for vaccines against infection  <cit> . m. synoviae enolase has also been confirmed to be a major immunogenic proteins and an extracellular protein  <cit> , but most features of m. synoviae enolase have not been reported. therefore, in the present study, the m. synoviae eno gene was cloned and expressed, and then the expression product was characterized so as to elucidate its roles in m. synoviae metabolism and pathogenesis.

RESULTS
cloning and expression of the m. synoviae eno gene
three primer pairs  were used to pcr-amplify three fragments of the eno gene from m. synoviae strain wvu  <dig> and then the full length of the eno gene was amplified using primer pairs eno1f/eno3r. after digestion with the saci/xhoi restriction enzymes, the eno gene was cloned into the pet-28a  vector. sequence analysis indicated that the eno gene was  <dig>  bp in length and the tryptophan codon  in the gene was successfully mutated to tgg. the eno gene encoded a 452-amino-acid protein with a theoretical molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda, which had a 99% sequence identity with that of m. synoviae  <dig> . it is also highly homologous with those of other mycoplasma species .

the recombinant pet-eno plasmid was transformed into e. coli bl <dig>  cells. then the recombinant rmseno protein was expressed by induction with iptg, assessed by sds-page with coomassie blue staining. the results showed that more rmseno was in the supernatant than in the sediment, and rmseno had an apparent molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda . purified rmseno had a single band .figure  <dig>

measurement of the enzymatic activity of the rmseno
the enzymatic activity of purified rmseno was higher than that of rabbit muscle enolase in catalyzing the conversion of 2-pga to pep at 30°c . the catalytic activity of rmseno increased with the increase of the 2-pga concentration from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm . using the data mentioned above and applying double-reciprocal lineweaver-burk plots, the km and vmax values of rmseno were determined to be  <dig>  × 10− <dig> m and  <dig>  μmol/l/min, respectively .figure  <dig>

subcellular localization of m. synoviae enolase
rabbit anti-rmseno serum was isolated and the elisa titer was determined as 1: <dig> . to determine the distribution of m. synoviae enolase, total cellular proteins, membrane proteins and cytoplasmic proteins of m. synoviae were subjected to western blot analysis using rabbit anti-rmseno serum. purified rmseno and bsa were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. the results showed that the rabbit anti-rmseno serum can bind to the total cellular proteins, membrane and cytoplasmic proteins of m. synoviae at approximately  <dig> kda . the rmseno antiserum can also bind to purified rmseno at approximately  <dig> kda  and no specific binding strips was shown with bsa . the results also indicated that m. synoviae enolase existed in both membrane fractions and cytoplasmic fractions of m. synoviae, but the content of enolase in the cytoplasmic fractions is more than the membrane fractions. the result was further confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy with the colloid gold labeling technique . non-immunized rabbit serum showed no binding activity .figure  <dig>

western blot analysis confirmed that both chicken plg and human fn interacted with rmseno with a binding band of approximately  <dig> kda . under similar conditions, bsa had no binding band . the elisa plate binding assay showed that the rmseno was able to bind to chicken plg and human fn in a dose-dependent pattern. bsa showed no interaction with either chicken plg or human fn .figure  <dig>

adherence and inhibition assays
adherence and inhibition assays have shown that the m. synoviae wvu <dig> strain can adhere to df- <dig> cells pre-treated with plg . and this adherence could be inhibited by rabbit anti-rmseno serum . non-immune rabbit serum showed no effect on the adherence inhibition of m. synoviae to df- <dig> cells . furthermore, immuno-fluorescence assay showed that no fluorescence was detected when df- <dig> cells were only incubated with the goat anti-rabbit igg -fitc . therefore, all these results have demonstrated that m. synoviae enolase is an adhesion-related protein.figure  <dig>

discussion
enolase is a multi-functional protein in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. aside from its enzymatic activity, enolase plays important roles in several biological and pathophysiological processes: enolase serves as a plg receptor on the surface of a variety of hematopoietic, epithelial, and endothelial cells and plays a crucial role in intravascular and pericellular fibrinolytic systems  <cit> . enolase has been implicated in many infectious, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases  <cit> . moreover, enolase has been identified as a protective antigen in some pathogens  <cit> . recent studies have shown that enolase plays an important role in transcriptional regulation and can also result in immune suppression  <cit> . in the present study, the m. synoviae eno gene was cloned and expressed in e. coli cells. sds-page showed that more product of rmseno expression were in the supernatant, which was convenient to study the catalytic activity and other biological characteristics of m. synoviae enolase. subsequently, the expression products were purified and characterized. enzymatic activity analysis showed that the purified rmseno could catalyze the conversion of 2-pga to pep in reaction buffer with  <dig> mm mgcl <dig> at 30°c and ph  <dig> .

the m. synoviae membrane and cytosolic proteins were isolated and analyzed to determine the subcellular localization of the m. synoviae enolase. by western blot and immuno-electron microscopic analyses, we demonstrated that m. synoviae enolase was found in the membrane and cytoplasm portions, which is consistant with the result reported previously  <cit> , which might be more conductive to perform its different functions. lactobacilli can rapidly modify their surface properties by translocation of enolase to the cell surface or releasing into the medium at different ph values  <cit> . whether the m. synoviae enolase has similar effect will be validated in future studies. using a complement-dependent mycoplasmacidal assay, we demonstrated that rabbit anti-rmseno serum displayed an obvious complement-dependent mycoplasmacidal effect. it has been confirmed that streptococcus suis serotype  <dig> enolase was a protective antigen  <cit> . based on the above results, we propose that m. synoviae enolase may be an important surface-exposed antigen. further studies will be designed to investigate whether m. synoviae enolase is a protective protein and could serve as a vaccine candidate.

the study demonstrated that m. synoviae enolase can bind to chicken plg and human fn, which is in accordance with the studies on other species of mycoplasma and other microorganisms  <cit> . moreover, the adherence of m. synoviae to df- <dig> cells can be effectively inhibited by rabbit anti-rmseno serum, which indicated that m. synoviae enolase is an important adhesion-related factor. that was also confirmed by adherence and inhibition assays of m. synoviae to the df- <dig> cells pretreated with plg. therefore, we reasoned that enolase plays important roles in m. synoviae adherence, colonization, and invasion to host cells, as reported in other pathogens  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the present study demonstrated that the rmseno displayed enolase activity by catalyzing the conversion of 2-pga to pep. moreover, the m. synoviae enolase was identified as a surface-exposed protein, and rabbit anti-rmseno serum displayed an obvious complement-dependent mycoplasmacidal effect. in addition, the present study demonstrated that m. synoviae enolase could bind to chicken plg and human fn, and rabbit anti-rmseno serum effectively inhibited adherence of m. synoviae to df- <dig> cells. therefore, we concluded that m. synoviae enolase plays an important role in m. synoviae metabolism, and could potentially impact infection and immunity. thus further studies on the functions of m. synoviae enolase are warranted.
