BACKGROUND
shewanella oneidensis mr- <dig>  a facultatively anaerobic member of the γ-class of proteobacteria, can respire anaerobically by reducing a wide variety of alternative electron acceptors including fumarate, nitrate, elemental sulfur, and such oxidized metals as fe, mn, and u  <cit> . in addition, mr- <dig> is capable of reducing hexavalent chromium, or chromate , to less toxic and sparingly soluble trivalent chromium  under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions  <cit> ; however, there have been no reports to date of the ability of mr- <dig> to generate energy for growth using cr as the sole terminal electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration  <cit> . this plasticity in the use of alternative electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration has engendered interest in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> as a model environmental organism with potential utility in the bioremediation of dissolved metal ions, and as a consequence, the complete mr- <dig> genome was sequenced to advance understanding of shewanella biology  <cit> .

to expand knowledge of metal stress responses in particular, we previously initiated genome-based studies focused on identifying the molecular components involved in the s. oneidensis response to chromate  <cit> , an anthropogenic pollutant widely distributed in the environment due to its prevalent use in manufacturing and military industries  <cit> . chromate toxicity is associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species during the intracellular partial reduction of cr to the highly reactive radical cr by various in vivo nonspecific reductants or cellular one-electron reductases  <cit> . our previous work employing dna microarrays and multidimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  demonstrated that a functionally unknown dna-binding response regulator  in mr- <dig> was reproducibly and significantly upregulated at both the transcript and protein levels in response to acute chromate challenge  <cit> .

in accordance with its ability to adapt to various environmental conditions, the s. oneidensis mr- <dig> genome encodes a relatively large repertoire of transcriptional regulators, including  <dig> predicted two-component regulatory system proteins consisting of  <dig> histidine protein kinase  genes,  <dig> response regulators , and  <dig> hk-rr hybrids  <cit> . prototypical two-component systems, which constitute the predominant mechanism used by bacteria for coupling environmental signals to specific adaptive responses, comprise a sensor histidine kinase and a cognate response regulator  <cit> . fundamental to signal transduction is a phosphotransfer mechanism that forms the core of both mechanistically simple as well as more complex signaling pathways. in this scheme, a membrane-bound sensor kinase catalyzes atp-dependent autophosphorylation at a conserved histidine residue in the hk cytoplasmic autokinase domain in response to a specific environmental cue. the signal is transduced through transfer of the phosphoryl group from the phosphohis of the hk to a conserved aspartate residue within the receiver module of a cytosolic rr. phosphorylation of the rr alters its affinity for dna, leading to the transcriptional activation or repression of specific genes. an essential feature of two-component systems is that specific histidine kinases and response regulators function as cognate pairs and are often arranged within the same operon. the s. oneidensis so <dig> protein appears to be an orphan rr as defined by the fact that there is no obvious cognate histidine kinase flanking the so <dig> gene or proximally located based on the genome annotation  <cit> .

the primary aim of the present study was to investigate the function of the uncharacterized so <dig> regulator within the context of chromate stress by performing a genome-wide screen for potential target genes of this rr in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  toward this end, we created an so <dig> in-frame deletion mutant and compared its global transcriptional profiles with that of wild-type mr- <dig> in response to chromate challenge using time-resolved microarray experiments. comparative transcriptome analysis suggested that so <dig> was associated with the activation of genes involved in siderophore-mediated fe uptake, fe storage, and possibly other cation transport processes.

RESULTS
sequence analysis of the response regulator so2426
based on its nucleotide sequence, the so <dig> gene of s. oneidensis mr- <dig> is predicted to encode a 237-amino-acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda  <cit> . comparative sequence analysis using clustalw  <cit>  revealed that so <dig> shares sequence similarity to cpxr from vibrio cholerae  and e. coli , and to ompr from v. cholerae  and e. coli  . in addition, so <dig> orthologs are present and conserved among many of the shewanella species sequenced to date, including shewanella sp. mr- <dig> , shewanella sp. mr- <dig> and sp. ana- <dig> , s. baltica os <dig> , s. putrefaciens  <dig> and cn- <dig> , s. woodyi atcc  <dig> , s. amazonensis sb2b , and s. frigidimarina ncimb  <dig> .

the deduced so <dig> protein consists of an n-terminal chey-like receiver domain and a c-terminal winged-helix dna-binding domain. the n-terminal portion of so <dig>  shares homology with receiver domains and contains the highly conserved signature residues that are thought to constitute the phosphorylated acid-pocket active site  <cit> . in chey, these residues correspond to asp <dig>  asp <dig>  and asp <dig>  with thr <dig> and lys <dig> completing the cluster of conserved residues surrounding the phosphorylation site  <cit> . thr <dig> and lys <dig>  although not absolutely required for phosphorylation, have been implicated in contributing to the phosphorylation-induced conformational change  <cit> . s. oneidensis so <dig> contains three contiguous aspartate residues near its n-terminus at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and there is a conserved substitution to serine at the equivalent position of  <dig>  the phosphate-accepting aspartic residue asp <dig> and lys <dig>  are retained at equivalent positions in the so <dig> primary sequence. it is presently not known whether a cognate histidine kinase interacts with so <dig> or whether phosphorylation plays a regulatory role in the cellular activity of so <dig>  the fact that so <dig> contains the highly conserved residues constituting the active phosphorylation pocket  suggests that the protein might be differentially controlled by phosphorylation. furthermore, it remains to be determined whether the regulatory activity of so <dig> is modulated in response to environmental or intracellular stimuli.

the c-terminal portion of so <dig>  contains a predicted winged helix-turn-helix  motif indicative of the dna-binding domains of response regulators in the ompr/phob subfamily  <cit> . the basic structure of the carboxy-terminal domains of ompr/phob subfamily response regulators is characterized by an amino-terminal four-stranded β sheet, a central three-helical bundle, and a c-terminal β-strand hairpin , which provides an additional interface for dna contact  <cit> .

the so <dig> gene is co-transcribed in an operon
based on the mr- <dig> genome annotation, so <dig> is an apparent orphan response regulator given that the so <dig> locus is not linked with a gene that encodes a potential cognate histidine kinase. as schematically represented in figure 2a, so <dig> is tightly clustered with four functionally unknown downstream genes, all possessing the same transcriptional polarity. located immediately downstream of so <dig> with a short intergenic spacer of  <dig> bp is a small orf  predicted to encode a soluble hypothetical protein , which was shown previously to be induced at the transcriptional level in response to acute chromate challenge  <cit> . the gene cluster is also characterized by orfs encoding a zinc carboxypeptidase domain protein , a hypothetical protein , and a conserved hypothetical protein  . the so <dig> orf overlaps so <dig> by  <dig> bp based on the mr- <dig> genome annotation (). the so <dig> region also includes a gene encoding a putative tonb-dependent receptor  positioned approximately  <dig> bp upstream of so <dig>  putative ρ-independent transcription terminators were identified downstream of the so <dig> and so <dig> orfs .

reverse transcription-pcr  experiments were performed to determine whether the so2427-so <dig> gene cluster is transcribed as a polycistronic mrna. primers p1–p <dig>  used in the pcr reactions following reverse transcription with random hexamers were designed to amplify regions spanning two or more orfs in order to establish the transcriptional organization. to assess the reproducibility of the results, multiple independent rt-pcr experiments were carried out using different preparations of total rna isolated from untreated or chromate-treated mr- <dig> cells. figure 2b shows a representative gel of the rt-pcr results using the entire suite of primers. each pcr product was confirmed by dna sequencing. no products were amplified when using either total rna as the template for pcr amplification  or primers complementary to an intergenic region located outside of the so2427-so <dig> cluster , thus indicating the absence of contaminating genomic dna in the total rna preparations. s. oneidensis mr- <dig> genomic dna was used as a positive control for the pcr conditions . amplicons of the expected sizes, i.e.,  <dig>  kb for primers p1/p <dig>   <dig>  kb for primers p1/p <dig>   <dig>  kb for primers p1/p <dig>   <dig>  kb for primers p2/p <dig>  and  <dig>  kb for primers p9/p <dig>  were obtained , indicating that the so2427-so <dig> region is co-transcribed as a polycistronic mrna under no-metal and chromate-amended conditions. however, given the presence of a putative ρ-independent terminator immediately downstream of so <dig>  we cannot rule out the possibility that the product generated from the so2427-so <dig> transcript might be due to read-through transcription.

characterization of the so <dig> promoter region
the transcription start site of the so <dig> gene was localized using 5' race analysis of mrna transcripts isolated from wild-type cells grown in either the absence or presence of chromate. two clear 5' termini, both mapping to a residues and corresponding to positions  <dig> and  <dig> bp upstream of a second in-frame atg  , were obtained by dna sequencing of the 5' race amplicons. these sites are located at positions  <dig> and  <dig> bp downstream of the initial atg  start codon, indicating that the original sequence annotation for this gene is incorrect and that the second atg  most likely constitutes the translation start codon for so <dig>  the so <dig> transcription start point indicated potential - <dig> and - <dig> basal promoter elements, 5'-taatat and 5'-gtgaca, respectively, with a 15-bp spacing between them. the putative - <dig> promoter sequence  has a 4/ <dig> match to the consensus σ70-dependent - <dig> hexamer element  from e. coli. interestingly, located one base upstream of the - <dig> hexamer is the extended - <dig> element 5'-tatg-3' , identified by mitchell et al.  <cit>  and shown to be an important determinant for promoter activity. finally, the identified so <dig> promoter region contains the putative - <dig> element 5'-gtgaca, which is a strong match  to the e. coli consensus - <dig> hexamer .

further analysis of the so <dig> upstream regulatory region revealed the presence of a putative recognition site for the ferric uptake regulator , the iron-binding global transcriptional regulator that serves as the dominant sensor of fe availability in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria . a putative palindromic fur box, 5'-aaatgatattgattctcgttt-3', which closely matched our previously derived predicted fur-binding motif for s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  <cit> , was identified at positions - <dig> to + <dig> immediately downstream of the - <dig> promoter element and overlapped the mapped transcription start sites for so <dig> . identification of a fur box is consistent with our previous microarray studies demonstrating increased so <dig> mrna levels in a s. oneidensis mr- <dig> fur knockout strain  <cit>  and suggests that expression of the so <dig> response regulator might be subject to fur-mediated repression.

growth and chromate reduction kinetics of the so <dig> deletion mutant
a cre-lox recombination method  <cit>  was used to create a nonpolar in-frame deletion of the so <dig> locus in mr- <dig> for the purpose of analyzing in depth the functional role of this response regulator in metal stress responses . the deleted segment was  <dig> bp in length and corresponded to positions - <dig> to + <dig>  from the annotated translational start site, leaving only  <dig> nucleotides of the so <dig> gene intact at the c-terminal end. the growth behavior of the Δso <dig> mutant in response to cr was examined using a bioscreen c reader to monitor culture turbidity  at 30-min intervals under aerobic conditions over  <dig> h. as shown in figure 4a, growth of the s. oneidensis Δso <dig> strain was comparable to the wild type in lb broth without added chromate. by contrast, growth of the Δso <dig> mutant was inhibited to a greater extent than the wild type in the presence of  <dig>  mm chromate as evident from the longer time interval required before the commencement of exponential growth.

to determine whether deletion of so <dig> affected the ability of mr- <dig> to remove extracellular cr from the medium, the wild-type and mutant strains were challenged with  <dig>  mm chromate  when cells reached mid-log phase . residual hexavalent chromium was measured spectrophotometrically at 3-h intervals using the chromogenic  <dig> -diphenylcarbazide  method  <cit> . the chromate disappearance profiles in figure 4b show that the parental mr- <dig> strain removed 100% of the external cr within  <dig> h, while the Δso <dig> mutant transformed approximately 50% within the same time period. no abiotic conversion of chromate was observed for the cell-free lb control .

complementation experiments were performed to ascertain whether the enhanced chromate sensitivity and slower chromate transformation rate for the so <dig> null mutant were due to the deletion of the response regulator gene so <dig> and not to secondary-site mutations introduced during the mutagenesis procedure. a complemented Δso <dig> strain was constructed by cloning the full-length so <dig> wild-type orf plus  <dig> bp of contiguous upstream sequence into the broad-host-range vector pbbr <dig> as described in the methods. transformation of pbbr <dig> into the Δso <dig> mutant resulted in a complemented strain, designated Δso <dig>  genetic complementation of the so <dig> gene in the mutant strain restored growth  and cr reduction capacity to near wild-type levels , thus reaffirming the integral role of so <dig> in the cellular response to chromate.

temporal transcriptome analysis of Δso <dig> and wild-type strains
prior to this study, nothing was known about the regulatory targets of the ompr family response regulator so <dig>  to investigate the effect of the so <dig> deletion on global gene expression and to identify candidate target genes under so <dig> control, the chromate-perturbed transcriptomes of the Δso <dig> mutant and the s. oneidensis mr- <dig> wild type were compared using whole-genome microarray analysis. time-series microarray experiments were performed in which global transcriptional profiles of the wild type and the Δso <dig> mutant strains were compared at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> min, and  <dig> hours following the addition of k2cro <dig>  to mid-exponentially growing cells . genes with altered expression ratios of ≥ 2-fold for at least one of the time points and having a p value of <  <dig>  were considered to be significantly changed and were further analyzed using clustering methods. overall, microarray expression profiling revealed that  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  genes were induced in the Δso <dig> mutant under chromate exposure, whereas  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  genes were repressed. the total number of differentially expressed genes was substantially less at the shorter, acute exposure times  compared to the longer exposure periods , at which point other effects such as accumulation of intracellular chromium  and stationary phase growth are likely impacting global expression profiles.

quantitative real-time rt-pcr  analysis was employed to assess the general quality of the microarray data by providing an independent measurement of gene expression for a small subset of genes. the five genes  selected for comparative qrt-pcr displayed downregulated or unaltered expression patterns at the 180-min time point of chromate exposure based on microarray hybridization. comparison of gene expression levels as determined by microarray and qrt-pcr analyses indicated a high degree of concordance, with a pearson's correlation coefficient  value of  <dig>  . for the mutant strain, both microarray hybridization and qrt-pcr indicated that so <dig> expression levels were not detectable above background, thus providing additional confirmation of deletion of the so <dig> gene.

functional classification of genes differentially expressed in the Δso <dig> mutant
pairwise complete-linkage clustering was used to identify groups of potentially co-ordinately regulated genes among the  <dig> orfs  showing a twofold or greater statistically significant  change in expression for at least one time point during cr exposure. one particularly noteworthy cluster of similarly expressed genes  comprises  <dig> genes with functions distributed across the following role categories: cellular processes , energy metabolism , hypothetical proteins , protein synthesis , regulatory functions/signal transduction , and transport and binding proteins . these clustered genes displayed a distinct pattern of downregulated expression in the Δso <dig> mutant relative to the wild-type mr- <dig> strain, particularly at the earlier time points  of chromate exposure . this is consistent with our previous studies demonstrating that the wild-type so <dig> gene was induced at the transcriptional level early in cr exposure, i.e.  <dig> min or less, but not at  <dig> h post-treatment  <cit> . closer inspection of the  <dig> potentially co-regulated genes  revealed that many of the transport/binding, hypothetical, and regulatory genes were shown previously to be upregulated in wild-type mr- <dig> cells in response to chromate treatment  <cit> , thus suggesting that these orfs are candidate gene targets of positive control by so <dig>  the genes constituting cluster a are discussed in greater detail in the sections below.

cluster b  includes  <dig> genes, three of which encode acrb/acrd/acrf family proteins  presumably involved in drug efflux and resistance. all of these  <dig> genes showed decreased expression in the Δso <dig> mutant except at the 24-h time point, where mrna levels increased . notably, cluster b also contains genes so <dig>  and so <dig> , both with annotated functions associated with the cell envelope, as well as cpxa . in e. coli, cpxa is the sensory inner membrane kinase that functions with its cognate partner, a cytoplasmic response regulator , in a prototypical two-component system to sense and respond to perturbations in the bacterial cell envelope . s. oneidensis cpxr also displayed downregulated temporal expression profiles in the Δso <dig> mutant under chromate challenge but grouped with genes in cluster a.

genes encoding transport and binding functions
thirteen of the genes in cluster a have annotated functions in metal transport and binding, in particular fe acquisition and homeostasis: ftn , so <dig> , so <dig> , so <dig> , alca , so <dig> and so <dig> , so <dig> , so <dig> , so <dig> , viua , so <dig> , and so <dig> . in contrast to the tonb-dependent receptor genes so <dig> and so <dig>  either no significant change or a maximal twofold decrease at the 180-min time point was observed for so <dig> , located directly upstream of the so <dig> response regulator gene. of the  <dig> genes with transport and binding functions in cluster a, ten orfs  were shown in an earlier study to be induced in chromate-challenged wild-type mr- <dig> cells compared to untreated cells  <cit> . temporal expression patterns for these genes demonstrated that they were downregulated 2- to 20-fold in the Δso <dig> strain over the 180-min time course , suggesting that so <dig> acts as a direct or indirect positive regulator of a subset of fe uptake and storage genes in s. oneidensis.

the alca-so3031-so <dig> operon encodes proteins required for siderophore biosynthesis in mr- <dig>  <cit> , and the product of gene so <dig> is predicted to allow for the cellular utilization of the structurally undetermined mr- <dig> siderophore. the differential profiles for these four genes were characterized by a peak in down-regulated expression  at the 180-min time interval post chromate addition, followed by no significant change in expression at  <dig> h . the first gene in the siderophore biosynthetic operon shows 48% sequence identity to bordetella pertussis alca, which is required for alcaligin production  <cit> , while the two downstream genes  diverge from alcb and alcc and are annotated as putative siderophore biosynthesis genes. while the structural identity of the mr- <dig> siderophore has not been elucidated, we predict that mr- <dig> likely produces a siderophore similar to putrebactin  <cit> , a novel cyclic dihydroxamate siderophore characterized from shewanella putrefaciens strain  <dig> and structurally similar to alcaligin.

consistent with the transcriptomic data, further physiological evidence for the involvement of the so <dig> response regulator in controlling siderophore-dependent iron acquisition was obtained by performing semiquantitative liquid cas assays in which relative siderophore production levels in supernatants of the Δso <dig> mutant were compared to those in wild-type mr- <dig> cultures. following 24-h growth in lb medium in the absence of added fecl <dig> or chromate, the Δso <dig> mutant  exhibited essentially no detectable siderophore production over that of the cell-free control , whereas wild-type mr- <dig> cultures  produced approximately 7-fold more siderophore than the Δso <dig> mutant. as expected, addition of  <dig> μm fecl <dig> to the culture medium reduced siderophore production by the wild-type to near background levels  but did not affect siderophore accumulation in the Δso <dig> mutant. in the presence of  <dig>  mm chromate, replicate cultures of wild-type mr- <dig> exhibited increasing levels in relative siderophore production over time , which was consistent with previous microarray expression data showing induction of siderophore biosynthesis genes in response to chromate exposure  <cit> . by contrast, the temporal profile for the Δso <dig> mutant showed an initial moderate increase and then a dramatic reduction in siderophore excretion compared to the wild type . collectively, these data support the hypothesis that so <dig> is a positive regulator of siderophore-mediated fe uptake.

cluster a also includes an s. oneidensis gene that is involved in fe storage, i.e., the ftn gene  encoding ferritin. the ftn mrna expression levels were down-regulated 4- to 20-fold in the so <dig> null mutant across the entire temporal range, with the peak in repression occurring at the 180-min time point . although iron is an essential micronutrient for most organisms, free excess fe in the presence of oxygen is potentially toxic because of its tendency to participate in fenton chemistry reactions, which generate cell-damaging reactive oxygen intermediates. by scavenging and storing intracellular free fe in a remobilizable form, ftn protects against fe-mediated formation of hydroxyl radicals  <cit> . studies have indicated that ferritins make important contributions to both fe storage as well as cellular protection against oxidative stress  <cit>  and that ftn transcription is co-ordinately regulated by iron and redox stress in some bacteria  <cit> . s. oneidensis ftn was shown previously to be induced at a low level  in chromate-exposed wild-type mr- <dig> cells in contrast to untreated cells  <cit> . the induction of ftn in s. oneidensis might act, at least partially, to mitigate chromate-generated oxidative stress by sequestering excess free fe available for the catalysis of fenton reactions and the formation of additional reactive hydroxyl radicals.

genes of unknown function
the majority of coordinately repressed genes in cluster a belong to the functional category of hypothetical and conserved hypothetical proteins . most notably, genes comprising the conserved hypothetical so1188-so1189-so <dig> operon exhibited the highest degree of down-regulated expression in the chromate-exposed Δso <dig> mutant relative to the wild type, with decreases in mrna ratios ranging from 45- to > 300-fold over the 180-min period. no significant changes in expression, however, were observed for these genes at the 24-h time point. in addition, the hypothetical gene so <dig>  which is co-transcribed with so <dig> in a polycistronic transcript , was repressed as much as 11-fold over the 180-min period, pointing to the possibility that the so <dig> operon may be under positive autoregulatory control. surprisingly, the functionally unknown genes so <dig>  so <dig>  and so <dig>  which also form part of the so <dig> operon, showed either a less than 2-fold change or no significant differential expression over the time course.

regulatory genes
in addition to metal transport and hypothetical genes described above, the temporal expression profiles for four transcriptional regulatory genes  were altered in the Δso <dig> mutant. the function of the regulators encoded by so <dig>  so <dig>  and so <dig> in s. oneidensis as well as their target genes are not known. however, gene so <dig> encodes a homolog of cpxr, the response regulator component of the cpxar envelope stress response system, which has been well characterized in e. coli . the annotated cpxr gene in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> was downregulated as much as threefold in response to the so <dig> deletion under chromate stress conditions . this is in contrast to the two- to three-fold induction measured for cpxr in chromate-treated wild-type mr- <dig> cells  <cit> . located immediately downstream of cpxr in an apparent operon is cpxa, which was downregulated as much as 3-fold in the mutant but grouped in a separate cluster .

in e. coli, the cpxar two-component pair constitutes a stress response system the main function of which is to sense and respond to cell envelope distress, principally misfolded periplasmic proteins, by activating genes encoding proteases and folding catalysts  <cit> . however, the complexity, extent, and response overlap of the cpx system have become progressively apparent, as evident from its involvement in outer membrane porin expression  <cit> , stationary-phase survival  <cit> , and the response to high ph stress  <cit>  to name a few. although the specific cellular role of the cpxr homolog in s. oneidensis has not been established, it is intriguing to consider the possibility that interplay between cpxr and so <dig> may occur in response to metal stress. it is conceivable that the cpxa-cpxr two-component system may respond to oxidative damage imposed on biomolecules as a consequence of reactive oxygen species generated during intracellular partial cr reduction.

other differentially regulated genes in the so <dig> deletion mutant
while hypothetical and metal transport/binding genes are dominant in cluster a , other notable genes with ≥ 2-fold-repressed mrna levels in the Δso <dig> mutant include orfs codifying a putative bicyclomycin resistance  protein  and a ferric iron reductase protein . bcr proteins are members of the major facilitator superfamily class of membrane efflux pumps and play important roles in drug resistance  <cit> . in a previous work, the so <dig> gene in a wild-type mr- <dig> genetic background exhibited 2- to 4-fold upregulated expression at the transcript level in response to short-term chromate exposure, i.e., up to  <dig> min  <cit> , but was shown in this study to be repressed as much as 4-fold in cr-challenged Δso <dig> cells , suggesting that the so <dig> gene is a direct or indirect target of so2426-mediated activation under chromate conditions. although the cellular function of so <dig> is presently unknown, its co-ordinately regulated expression with the siderophore biosynthesis operon  and gene so <dig>  encoding a ferric alcaligin siderophore receptor, is intriguing. studies in other bacterial systems have shown that certain proteins resembling bcr at the amino acid level function in siderophore export from the cell  <cit> .

downregulated expression of gene so <dig>  peaked at the 90-min time point with a 4-fold decrease in mrna levels . ferric iron reductases are thought to be involved in reducing siderophore-complexed fe to fe, thus enabling dissociation of the high-affinity fe3+-chelating siderophore from iron  <cit> . the entire so3030-so <dig> gene cluster, which is predicted to be involved in siderophore production and utilization, exhibits similar temporal expression profiles in the mutant, suggesting a role for the so <dig> response regulator in coordinating these functions. it is not clear whether the other differentially expressed energy metabolism genes  contribute directly to chromate stress response or show altered transcription as a result of secondary effects associated with the so <dig> deletion. these genes were not observed to be induced in response to chromate exposure in our previous transcriptomic studies using wild-type s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
s. oneidensis so <dig> is an apparent orphan response regulator with an n-terminal domain that contains an aspartate residue at the canonical receiver phosphorylation site and a predicted c-terminal whth motif indicative of response regulators in the ompr subfamily. although previous work in this laboratory demonstrated enhanced mrna levels for the so <dig> gene in a s. oneidensis fur-deficient strain  <cit>  and in chromate-challenged wild-type mr- <dig> cells  <cit> , the basic molecular function of this predicted transcriptional regulator remained undefined. in this study, by integrating functional genomics and genetic approaches, we have shown that so <dig> is a direct or indirect positive regulator of siderophore-mediated fe transport systems, the fe storage gene ftn, and other as-yet uncharacterized cation transport genes. at this time, however, we cannot discount the possibility of negative regulation by so <dig> as well. clustering analysis of temporal transcriptome data revealed a distinctive subset of  <dig> coordinately expressed genes that were consistently downregulated in the so <dig> deletion mutant during the initial 180-min period of chromate exposure. many of these genes – namely, ftn, the alca-so3031-so <dig> siderophore biosynthesis operon, so <dig> , so <dig> , viua, so <dig> , as well as a number of hypothetical genes – constituted the predominant molecular response to acute chromate stress in wild-type mr- <dig>  <cit> . the transcriptomic analyses described here identified a number of possible directly so2426-regulated genes, including those of unknown function, that may serve as targets for future studies.

one possible hypothesis that can be generated from the collective data described here is that s. oneidensis mr- <dig> employs at least two control mechanisms for regulating fe acquisition via siderophores under conditions of external fe insufficiency: derepression as a result of decreased fur activity and activation by so <dig> to enhance needed expression of fe transport systems. cas siderophore assays clearly demonstrated that the Δso <dig> mutant was deficient in siderophore production compared to wild-type mr- <dig> cultures in the presence and absence of chromate, indicating that so <dig> plays a positive role in coordinating the regulation of siderophore-dependent fe uptake mechanisms in s. oneidensis. furthermore, the impaired chromate reduction rate of the so <dig> deletion strain points to a connection between fe transport and chromate stress response that requires further delineation at the molecular level. our previous global studies characterizing the transcriptome and proteome of wild-type mr- <dig> in response to sub-lethal acute doses of chromate demonstrated a dramatic and unexpected induction of genes involved in fe sequestration and uptake in contrast to unchallenged cells  <cit> . two possible explanations for this observation are  fe limitation under external chromate conditions, and  direct or indirect displacement of the fe cofactor from fur-binding sites under elevated cr, resulting in decreased dna-binding activity of the fur repressor and subsequent derepression of target genes. exposure to other metals has been shown to perturb intracellular fe pools and hence influence fur-mediated repression  <cit> . future studies will focus on experimentally confirming direct gene targets of so <dig> control and further elucidating the linkage between regulation of fe homeostasis and chromate stress response at molecular and physiological levels.
