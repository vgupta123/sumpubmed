BACKGROUND
the increasing resistance of small strongyles , parascaris spp.  and oxyuris equi  against anthelmintic drugs  requires major changes in equine parasite control. during the past 50 years, horses were mainly treated prophylactically multiple times per year . this approach was based on recommendations, given mainly in order to avoid infections with strongylus vulgaris  <cit> . due to the emerging resistance of cyathostominae to available anthelmintic drugs, an alternative approach based on selective anthelmintic therapy  has been implemented in some horse farms  <cit> . the principle of sat comprises a major change in the frequency of applying anthelmintics with an anti-strongyle spectrum based on the treatment of horses with a faecal egg count  of strongyle eggs above a certain threshold, determined with a quantitative faecal egg count method, such as the mcmaster . nevertheless, for reliable detection of infections with other important equine parasite species like anoplocephala perfoliata, o. equi, and strongylus spp.  further specific diagnostic tests should be applied  <cit> .


the intensive anthelmintic treatment regime of the last decades might be responsible for the current low occurrence of s. vulgaris  recently determined by larval culture in german horses . however, a reliable diagnostic method for the differentiation of s. vulgaris from cyathostominae is essential because of the significant pathology caused by the migration of s. vulgaris-larvae in the mesenteric arteries. associated pathogenic effects like intestinal infarction, peritonitis, verminous arteritis, thrombosis and embolism can provoke symptoms such as colic, hind-leg lameness, neurological abnormalities and lesions in the heart, liver or kidney which might be lethal in the worst case .


currently, the standard method for the differentiation of cyathostominae and strongylinae is the determination of morphological differences of third-stage larvae  after larval culture since their egg morphology is similar and thus impossible to distinguish  <cit> . however, even though this method has the advantage of being cost-efficient, it is also very time-consuming due to the developmental period of the strongyle egg to the l <dig> and the subsequent morphological differentiation which should be performed by experienced qualified personnel .

to date, detection of s. vulgaris is possible with conventional and real-time pcrs in faecal samples as well as a serum enzyme linked immunosorbent assay  .

according to previously conducted studies, both the conventional and the real-time pcr provide high specificity and sensitivity . moreover, nielsen et al.  <cit>  claimed the real-time pcr as a potential standard method for a reliable detection of s. vulgaris  <cit> . therefore, the objectives of the present study were to evaluate the detection of s. vulgaris via real-time pcr in comparison to the standard diagnostic method  and to add information about the occurrence of s. vulgaris in german horses detected by real-time pcr and larval culture.

methods
faecal samples
in total,  <dig> equine faecal samples from  <dig> german farms were collected from march  <dig> to may  <dig>  all samples were obtained from the diagnostic centre of the chair of comparative tropical medicine and parasitology, lmu munich, germany. every sample was analysed using a modified mcmaster method with a detection limit of  <dig> eggs per gram faeces  and the combined-sedimentation-flotation method  <cit> . samples with a minimum of  <dig> epg were selected.

assuming a german horse population of  <dig>  million  <cit>  with a prevalence for an infection with s. vulgaris of 1% , a minimum of  <dig> horses had to be investigated since in this case the probability to detect at least one infected horse was above 99%  <cit> . thus, samples of  <dig> of  <dig> horses  were investigated by real-time pcr for an infection with s. vulgaris  in the present study.fig.  <dig> overview of the division of equine faecal samples and the corresponding motivation




for  <dig> of the  <dig> horses, a sufficient amount of faecal material was available for the preparation of a larval culture in order to differentiate the larvae.

in  <dig> of the  <dig> investigated horses, follow-up examinations were carried out 4– <dig> months after the initial examination. in this context, a total of  <dig> samples of the  <dig> horses from six different farms were analysed by real-time pcr and larval culture. follow-up examinations were performed if either the real-time pcr-result was positive for s. vulgaris  or non-determinable larvae were present in the first larval culture examination. in the case of two horses which were s. vulgaris positive in the first examination, the whole horse group was tested also for s. vulgaris. with these examinations, the dissemination of s. vulgaris should be verified at horses living on the same holding.table  <dig> dates of initial and follow-up examinations of four real-time pcr-positive horses




none of the horses that underwent a follow-up examination had been dewormed until the date of the retest. thus, a total of  <dig> samples were analysed by real-time pcr and a total of  <dig> samples were analysed by larval culture .

the total data pool was separated into two data sets for the different analyses either on sample or on horse level . furthermore, prevalence analyses were performed on horse and on farm level. as soon as one horse was tested s. vulgaris-positive, its farm of origin was classified as positive on the farm level.

as far as possible, information was collected on every investigated horse, namely age, breed, gender and the date of the last anthelmintic treatment.

egg detection, concentration and isolation
gastrointestinal strongyle eggs were isolated from faecal samples using a combined-sedimentation-flotation technique  <cit> . at first, 40 g of faeces were mixed with 500 ml of water, then filtered through a 300 μm sieve and sedimented at 10 °c for 12 h. the sediment was divided and transferred into two centrifuge tubes – one with saturated sugar solution  and one with saturated zinc sulphate solution  and centrifuged for 5 min at 635 g.

in case of a positive microscopic diagnosis of strongyle eggs, the egg counts were classified as sporadic , numerous  or plentiful .

the eggs were rinsed from the cover slip with distilled water, poured into a beaker and into a centrifuge tube  which was then centrifuged at 635 g for 10 min. the remaining liquid was withdrawn by suction. the remaining sediment was transferred into a  <dig>  ml eppendorf tube and then centrifuged one more time at  <dig>  g for 3 min. the remaining liquid was withdrawn by suction and the sediment was frozen in a dry state at −20 °c.

larval identification
larval cultures modified after roberts and o’sullivan  <cit>  were carried out for the morphological determination of s. vulgaris larvae. ten grams of faeces were incubated at room temperature for 14 days. during these 14 days, the samples were ventilated every day for 1 h and moistened to avoid desiccation of the faeces. the baermann-wetzel technique was used to isolate the l <dig>  <cit> .

after the migration time of 24 h at room temperature, 10 ml of the liquid was drawn off from the baermann funnel. for concentration of the larvae, the liquid was stored in a centrifuge tube at 10 °c for another 24 h. subsequently, the supernatant was withdrawn by suction and 2 ml were left in the tube. all larvae contained in the sediment were counted  and morphologically determined via microscope. for immobilisation of the larvae, one drop of lugol’s iodine was added to one drop of the larval suspension and investigated immediately. the morphological criteria were determined according to bürger et al.  <cit>  and boch et al.  <cit> .

dna extraction from isolated eggs
the extraction was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instruction  according to the blood or body fluid spin protocol . briefly, before extraction the sediment containing the strongyle eggs was incubated in an ultrasonic bath with 150 μl pbs  for 4 min followed by a freezing step for 20 min at −20 °c and a repetition of the incubation step. the dna was eluted with 200 μl elution buffer. dna concentration  and quality of each sample were analysed with the nano-drop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer . the samples were stored at –20 °c until used for pcr analysis.

molecular analyses
real-time pcr
samples were screened for s. vulgaris by real-time pcr using the ab- <dig> real time pcr system . pcr targeted rdna sequences of the second internal transcribed spacer  of cyathostominae and strongylus spp. nematodes. the forward primer sv-f , the reverse primer sv-r  and the modified probe sv-p 5′-fam-tggatttattctcactacttaattgtttcgcgac-bhq1-3′ were used as previously described  <cit> . the 25 μl reaction volume consisted of 5 μl of template dna,  <dig>  μl  of each primer ,  <dig>  μl of the probe  and 15 μl taqman gene expression master mix . a negative and a positive control were added to each pcr reaction. the positive control  was provided by the m. h. gluck equine research center, university of kentucky, usa. the following pcr protocol was used: an initial activation at 95 °c for 10 min followed by a set of 40 cycles, each consisting of 15 s at 95 °c and 60 s at 60 °c .

to verify the efficiency and the relative sensitivity of the real-time pcr, a standard curve was created according to the ab systems manufacturer’s instruction  with ten fold dilution steps of the positive control . an analysis was performed up to a dilution step of 1: <dig> .

results were recorded as the mean pcr cycle number at which the fluorescence detection threshold had been exceeded . the threshold line was set at the optimal point in the linear phase of the amplification plot. the observation of an exponential rise up to a ct of  <dig>  was counted as positive according to the results of the standard curve.

conventional pcr and sequencing
in order to verify the results of the real-time pcr, an additional conventional pcr with subsequent sequencing of the amplification products was performed with real-time pcr-positive samples using the same primers  .

the reaction mix contained 5 μl of template dna, 5 μl  of buffer 10x, 1 μl  of dntps,  <dig>  μl  of each primer ,  <dig>  μl  of hotstar taq dna polymerase kit  and water-ultra pure grade filled up to a total volume of 50 μl. the following protocol was used: 5 min at 95 °c for one cycle, 95 °c for 30 s, 49 °c for 30 s and 72 °c for 40 s for 45 cycles, followed by 72 °c for 5 min.

pcr products of the conventional pcr were analysed in 2% agarose gel stained with gel red™ nucleic acid stain,  <dig>  x in water . the dna gene ruler 100 bp plus dna ladder was used for sizing and quantification of the pcr products. the visualisation of gel images was performed with a gel documentation system .

the positive pcr products were purified using the qiaquick pcr purification kit  following the manufacturer’s protocol. forward and reverse sequencing was performed by eurofins mwg operon . reverse sequences were reversed, complemented, and aligned to the forward sequences using online tools . database searches and sequence comparisons were done with blast provided by the national center for biotechnology information .

statistical analyses
statistical analyses were performed using ibm® spss® software version  <dig>   and microsoft excel  <dig> . since our data did not satisfy normality assumptions, classical non-parametric methods were used. the correlation between epg and l/10 g faeces was calculated using a spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. in order to determine the statistical difference of the capability of the real-time pcr and the larval culture to detect a s. vulgaris positive sample, a mcnemar test was performed for comparison of paired proportions and kappa values were calculated for an evaluation of agreement between the two tests. all statistical analyses were interpreted as statistically significant up to the p-value <  <dig> .

RESULTS
sample origin
out of the  <dig> samples, strongyle faecal egg counts  of  <dig> samples  were positive ranging from < <dig> to  <dig>  epg. an epg of > <dig> was recorded in  <dig> samples .

of the  <dig> faecal egg count positive samples,  <dig> samples  from  <dig> horses were randomly selected for further investigation with real-time pcr. the number of investigated horses originating from  <dig> farms ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> per farm.

the fec of the real-time pcr s. vulgaris-positive samples, ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> epg. the fec of one sample could not be determined due to the low amount of faecal material available. however, it was included in the study due to the numerous strongyle eggs detected in the combined-sedimentation-flotation.

of those  <dig> animals, the age was known for  <dig> and the gender was known for  <dig> horses.

the age of the horses ranged from  <dig> to 35 years with an average age of 12 years. samples originating from  <dig> mares ,  <dig> geldings  and five stallions  were examined. on average for  <dig> horses, the last anthelmintic treatment had been performed 11 months  prior to enrolment into the present study.

larval culture
larval culture were performed and evaluated from  <dig> faecal samples originating from  <dig> horses . a total of  <dig>  cyathostominae larvae  were detected in  <dig> % of the cultures . between  <dig> and  <dig>  larvae per 10 g faeces were counted. the epg and the l/10 g faeces correlated with a spearman’s rank correlation of  <dig>  .

a total of 11 s. vulgaris larvae were detected in altogether four samples .

regarding the horse level, s. vulgaris was found in  <dig> of  <dig> horses . s. vulgaris-positive horses originated from  <dig> out of  <dig> investigated farms .

the occurrence of different larval stages in a total of  <dig> larval cultures was documented in detail. strongylinae larvae in first-  and second-stage  were found in  <dig> samples in a range of sporadic  and in four samples in a range of numerous . additionally, empty sheaths of strongylinae larvae were found in five of the  <dig> samples . larvae of triodontophorus sp. were found in nine samples, larvae of trichostrongylus axei in three samples and larvae of free-living nematodes were present in  <dig> samples.

with regard to the horse level of  <dig> horses, the occurrence of s. vulgaris obtained by real-time pcr was  <dig> % . s. vulgaris-positive horses originated from  <dig> of  <dig> investigated farms . on each farm only one horse was tested positive for s. vulgaris.


the standard curve revealed an efficiency of  <dig> % . a positive analysis was performed with a dilution of up to 1: <dig>   of the positive control in order to estimate the relative sensitivity. due to an unknown amount of dna in the positive control, no reference value was available and it was not possible to analyse a quantitative potential of the real-time pcr. there was no statistically significant correlation between the number of s. vulgaris larvae within one sample and the corresponding ct-value since the total amount of samples was too small. one pcr-positive sample containing a single larva of s. vulgaris had a ct-value of  <dig> , which is higher compared to the ct-values of  <dig>  to  <dig>  obtained by the other three pcr-positive samples containing three or four larvae in the culture.

follow-up examinations
four initially s. vulgaris-positive horses were retested in follow-up examinations. the follow-up samples of two horses tested positive on a daily basis. horse  <dig>  was tested positive in the single follow-up examination  which was performed 4 months after the initial examination. the follow-up examination of horse  <dig>  was carried out 6 months after the initial examination. in this context faecal samples were taken and analysed for s. vulgaris on  <dig> consecutive days. in addition to the initial investigation, s. vulgaris was also detected in the faecal samples collected on day  <dig> and  <dig> . the other follow-up examinations of all horses that were retested were negative for s. vulgaris. however, the low number of follow-up examined horses in this study did not allow for a statistical analysis.

comparison of real-time pcr and larval culture
a direct comparison between real-time pcr and larval culture could be drawn for  <dig> samples of the sample level. the results of the latter two methods differed significantly according to the mcnemar’s test  . this is in line with cohen’s kappa which shows a value of  <dig>  indicating only moderate agreement.table  <dig> comparison of results of larval culture and real-time pcr

conventional pcr and sequencing
interpretable sequencing results were obtained from all  <dig> isolates. two of them were 100% homologous with a sequence of s. vulgaris from a horse from australia   <cit> . eleven sequences showed a 99% similarity to the latter sequences containing a single nucleotide substitution .

sequences determined at the its- <dig> region in this work were deposited in genbank under the following accession numbers: kt <dig> – kt <dig> 

discussion

s. vulgaris was detected in three of  <dig> investigated horses  by larval culture and in  <dig> of  <dig> investigated horses  by real-time pcr. this low occurrence of s. vulgaris is in line with previously conducted studies investigating faecal samples from german horses obtained by larval culture with a prevalence ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> % . a comparable prevalence has also been reported in switzerland  <cit> .

in contrast, studies from other countries revealed a higher prevalence for s. vulgaris both by larval culture and by pcr. in a study from denmark, nielsen et al.  <cit>  screened  <dig> horses from  <dig> farms via larval culture and real-time pcr with a result of 113 s. vulgaris-positive horses . in an investigation of horses from poland by necropsy, nematodes were isolated from the intestine and differentiated revealing a prevalence of  <dig> %  for s. vulgaris  <cit> . an even higher prevalence of  <dig> %  was detected in horses from sardinia, italy, via larval culture  <cit> . in comparison with data from germany, bracken et al.  <cit>  found a higher prevalence of infection with s. vulgaris in danish horses not only on the horse level with  <dig> %  but also on the farm level with  <dig> % . a comparable result on the farm level was reported by nielsen et al. with a prevalence of  <dig> %  determined by larval culture  <cit> .

in the present study, s. vulgaris was detected in ten out of  <dig> investigated farms . a low occurrence of s. vulgaris in farms from germany was further demonstrated by the fact that both the real time pcr and the larval culture revealed a single s. vulgaris-positive horse per farm, solely. these findings are in agreement with another recent german prevalence survey, which reported a farm level of  <dig> %  and detected only a single s. vulgaris positive horse per farm using larval culture  <cit> .

the intensive anthelmintic treatment regime of the last decades as well as the long prepatent period of six to 7 months might be responsible for the current low occurrence of s. vulgaris in germany  <cit> . based on these arguments, a low occurrence for s. vulgaris under 5% was reported by hertzberg et al.  <cit>  for horses living in switzerland. despite the intensive anthelmintic treatment regime of the last decades, the occurrence of s. vulgaris still persists on a low level. a possible reason for this persistence could be a non-complete larvicidal efficacy of ivermectin, as suggested by nielsen et al. due to his study results in  <dig>  <cit> .

different surveys have pointed out that the number of cyathostominae larvae in larval cultures is higher compared to the number of s. vulgaris larvae  <cit> . for example, ogbourne and duncan  <cit>  refer to a wide variety of strongyle species in equine faecal samples comprising larvae of s. vulgaris in less than 10%. bellaw and nielsen  <cit>  reported that approximately  <dig> % of detected larvae were l <dig> of s. vulgaris . in the present study,  <dig> % of all larvae in 13 s. vulgaris-positive samples were l <dig> of s. vulgaris . both the marginal number of counted s. vulgaris-larvae in the larval culture and the finding of only one s. vulgaris-positive horse per farm might be explained by a low infection rate and by a low shedding of s. vulgaris eggs of infected horses.

accordingly, false negative results might occur in samples comprising a low number of s.vulgaris eggs. thus, the dependence on the presence of eggs in the investigated faecal sample is the major disadvantage of the diagnosis of s. vulgaris with coprological methods like real-time pcr and larval culture  <cit> . additionally, the relatively long prepatent period as well as the dependence of the development of the infectious l <dig> on environmental conditions is responsible for the seasonality of s. vulgaris which may lead to false negative results at certain times of the year  <cit> . various studies were able to proof a seasonal fluctuation of egg shedding of s. vulgaris, with a peak in summer and a depression in winter . yet, the study at hand was not able to confirm such an influence of seasonality on the detection of s. vulgaris-eggs due to a non-seasonal collection of samples and a low number of positive samples. however, the present study revealed a significantly improved detection rate of s. vulgaris by real-time pcr in comparison to the current standard larval culture method.

a molecular method for the detection of strongylus spp. was first described by campbell et al., in  <dig>  the specificity of the conventional pcr investigating the its- <dig> gene of s. vulgaris has already been analysed by detecting interspecific variations in the sequence of the its- <dig> gene between s. vulgaris, s. edentatus and s. equinus via conventional pcr and subsequent sequencing  <cit> . the specificity of the real-time pcr was confirmed by nielsen et al.  <cit>  via cross reaction testing between s. vulgaris, s. edentatus, s. equinus and a mixture of different cyathostominae larvae. therefore, a possible cross reaction with dna of other equine strongylid nematodes was not expected. besides the specificity, the sensitivity of the real-time pcr has also been analysed by nielsen et al. resulting in a detection limit of a  <dig>  strongyle egg-equivalent  <cit> .

due to the developmental period of up to 14 days for strongyle larvae, the larval culture is a time-consuming  <cit>  though cost-efficient method for the detection of s. vulgaris. a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 84% determined by larval culture compared to necropsy data have been reported by nielsen et al.  <cit> . however, this method is also dependent on the presence of s. vulgaris eggs in the investigated samples just like the real-time pcr. furthermore, the larval culture has the additional disadvantage that false negative results might occur due to an inhibited development of l <dig> which might be caused by fluctuations of temperature, humidity, fungal growth and contamination with free-living nematodes. in the present study, the successful cultivation of cyathostominae larvae was verified by the positive correlation between the “number of cyathostominae larvae” and the “fec” of the faecal sample. cyathostominae larvae were successfully cultivated in 98% of the strongylid egg-positive samples. a possible explanation for an inhibited development of larvae might be an accidental partial freezing of samples during transportation which was reported for  <dig> fec-positive samples which revealed only a limited number of larvae in the larval culture. the negative impact of low temperatures on the development of strongyle larvae has already been descripted by ogbourne and duncan  <cit> , hasslinger  <cit>  and enigk  <cit> . furthermore, steps of the procedure following cultivation such as discharging of supernatant, purification, sedimentation and pipetting might also lead to a loss of larvae. the morphological differentiation of larvae via microscopic examination needs to be conducted by qualified and experienced personnel, since the detection of s. vulgaris larvae is difficult and time-consuming  <cit> . false negative results due to the latter aspects might easily occur especially since s. vulgaris-positive samples often comprise only a limited number of s. vulgaris larvae. the usage of an aliquot procedure with the design to investigate 100– <dig> larvae in order to save time might also contribute to false negative results.

with the intent to avoid this error, all larvae per 10 g/faeces were identified in the present study.

in order to maintain or even reduce the low occurrence of s. vulgaris in germany and to prevent the introduction of s. vulgaris within and among farms, an appropriate optimisation of the diagnostic and management procedures is crucial  <cit> .

application of real-time pcr for detection of s. vulgaris as a routine method is possible in any laboratory with appropriate equipment for the real-time pcr-procedure  <cit> . strongyle eggs recovered by the standard combined sedimentation/flotation method can directly be used for the dna-extraction and subsequent real-time pcr. in the present study, a fec of  <dig> epg was sufficient for the detection of s. vulgaris by real-time pcr.

since the follow-up examinations in this study revealed that not every single examination reproduce an initially s. vulgaris-positive result, the investigation of composite faecal samples per horse by real-time pcr for an adequate detection of s. vulgaris might be useful in the daily routine diagnostics. moreover, all horses of a herd or at least “high-risk patients” like newcomers and horses with unknown deworming history should be examined individually  <cit> . preliminary to an integration into a new farm, thorough examination for s. vulgaris is also essential for horses originating from countries with a high prevalence for s. vulgaris like denmark, a part of italy and poland  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
according to the results of the present study, the detection of patent infections with s. vulgaris via real-time pcr reveals a significantly improved detection rate improvement compared to the current standard method based on larval culture and subsequent morphological differentiation. thus, the real-time pcr might be a reliable option for the detection of s. vulgaris in equine faecal samples in the routine diagnostic and in the integrated equine parasite control.
