BACKGROUND
sex determination and early gonadal development depends upon specific embryonic gene programs that activate differentiation of the bipotential primodium. these processes hinge upon the expression of both sex-linked and autosomal genes that promote or antagonize male or female cell fate pathways. the products of some genes are essential for female  and follistatin)  <cit>  and male  and fgf- <dig> )  <cit>  sex-determination in mammals. in mammals, as well as teleosts, dax- <dig> , foxl <dig> , cytochrome p <dig> aromatase, mis , sf- <dig> , sox- <dig>  box -9), wt- <dig>   <cit>  and many other gene products contribute in directing sex-determined fates, as well as to subsequent gonad development and function .

sf- <dig> is central to the activity of many of these genes as well as a large component of steroidogenic genes. both sf- <dig> and dax- <dig> are orphan receptors for which no ligand has yet been unequivocally identified, but which do possess ligand-binding domains  <cit> . sf- <dig> and dax- <dig> interact cooperatively or antagonistically to influence various target gene activities  <cit> . dax- <dig> modulates transcription of genes such as aromatase  <cit>  and mis  <cit>  through direct interactions with sf- <dig> and the recruitment of other factors. functional interactions of sf- <dig> with wt- <dig> or dax- <dig> promotes or inhibits the expression of mis  <cit> . the products of dax <dig>  foxl <dig> and sf <dig> each play critical roles in the transcriptional regulation of aromatase  genes  <cit> .

elucidation of the factors that promote or repress the transcription of these differentiation factors will also help to characterize the regulatory programs they initiate. conservation of transcription factor binding motifs in the promoters of mammalian and teleost genes point to shared regulatory regimes. the expression patterns of the genes described here may be deciphered in part by examination of their promoter regions. antagonism between dax- <dig> and foxl <dig> or sf- <dig> and sox factors may be common themes for activation or repression among many of these differentiation factors  <cit> .

although our understanding of the action of various sex determination and differentiation factors in early gonad development is well-established, our knowledge of other roles that these regulators may play before formation of sexual tissues is limited. sex-specific regulation of various steroidogenic and differentiation regulators in trout have been demonstrated by molecular studies to occur about one month before observable morphological differences  <cit> . histologically discernable features of gonad differentiation in salmonids become manifest approximately five weeks after hatching  <cit> .

in the atlantic salmon , we have detected the expression of dax1/ <dig>  foxl2a/b and mis  more than three weeks before even the hatching stage. in this paper we show that the genes we examined were expressed several months before morphologically discernable differentiation of the gonad. this is the first time, other than for dax <dig>  that this has been demonstrated for the genes we selected. we also demonstrate broad expression of these regulators in various extragonadal adult tissues. therefore genes previously considered to be involved in gonadogenesis and steroidogenesis are apparently more general in their transcriptional programming, at least in salmon.

furthermore, we have isolated, sequenced and assembled bacs containing these genes and analyzed their proximal promoters. our expression studies also reveal unique splicing activities that occur among some of these regulators. taken together, we suggest that the roles of dax1/ <dig>  foxl2a/b, mis and sf <dig> are not confined to differentiation and development of gonadal  cell lineages and examine the potential influence of the novel splicing and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of these factors within and outside the hpag axis.

RESULTS
stages that present challenges during development
to characterize the stages of development of the atlantic salmon and identify potentially problematic stages, we assayed mortality rates during embryonic and larval development. the day of fertilization was day   <dig>  and hatching and yolk sac absorption occurred between d <dig> to d <dig> and d <dig> to d <dig>  respectively. images of selected stages taken during the course of early development are presented in figure  <dig>  we counted the mortalities each collection day during the development study. we found that there were at least four stages which can present potential developmental challenges . one stage comes at d <dig> , the point at which we noted eye formation was initiated. next, from d <dig> to d <dig> is a period when hatching had begun. most larvae hatched between d <dig> and d <dig>  but there also were a large number for which hatching was delayed. the large peak at d <dig>  marks  <dig> mortalities due to late, incomplete or unsuccessful hatching. many larvae in this group failed to complete hatching or had survival problems once hatched. the two small peaks that follow this period represent morphological abnormalities that arose during alevin development .

early expression of sex differentiation factors
it became increasingly clear from preliminary studies that the expression of known sex differentiation regulators were expressed much earlier in salmonid development than we had expected. to determine when expression of these sex differentiation factors was initiated, we prepared rna from embryos two days post-fertilization  and succeeding time points. our rt-pcr results show that the mrna for many of these genes is present very early in development , at least one month ahead of previously characterized expression of regulators linked to differentiation of the salmonid gonad  <cit> . it was necessary to reamplify the early amplification products of dax <dig>  foxl2a, foxl2b, mis and sf <dig> for presentation in figure  <dig>  we do not know if these transcripts are maternally contributed or if they are the result of zygotic transcription. to the best of our knowledge, for the genes we detected at these early stages, there presently is only evidence for the expression of dax <dig> in embryonic cells in mammals  <cit> .

also of interest are the gene expression results for larvae and alevin between d <dig> to  <dig>  it is known that dax <dig>  foxl <dig> and sf <dig> expression correlates with transcription of cyp19a in many species  <cit> . we therefore were interested in examining the expression of these regulators in relationship to cyp19a transcription. most if not all of the genes known to be involved in aromatase transactivation were expressed during this period . cyp19b <dig> was expressed weakly as early as d <dig> , but weak expression of cyp19a was not detected until at least d <dig> . the earliest "strong" detection of the expression of cyp19a was d <dig>  nearly two months after the earliest expression of its regulators . thus, although the genes  important to cyp19a regulation were present, it was not until three weeks later  that cyp19a transcription was strongly detected . this is similar to findings that were made for ovary-specific cyp19a expression in trout  <cit> . this time point may be considered a mark of the earliest molecular expression of steroidogenic and differentiation factors before morphologically distinguishable features of sex differentiation  <cit> .

expression of sex differentiation factors in various adult tissues
most of the information available on the genes we examined is from investigations done on the brain or gonadal tissue . we therefore explored the expression of each gene in twelve tissues extracted and prepared from three different male and female adult fish. analysis of the rt-pcr results indicates that most of these genes were expressed quite broadly . we were most surprised to find the expression of sf <dig>  mis and both sox <dig> genes across all tissues examined, particularly in the male. it was also interesting to compare the expression patterns between paralogs where it was possible to distinguish potential regulatory differences between foxl2a and foxl2b, and cyp19a and cyp19b <dig> transcripts . we also detected the expression of multiple products for cyp19b <dig> and mis and these amplicons were isolated, cloned and sequenced.

alternative splicing of mis transcripts
mis is a member of the tgf superfamily of proteins that share features that are conserved across many species from fish to mammals  <cit> , each containing an n-terminal prodomain and a c-terminal domain that presents mis. proteolysis of the prodomain from the c-terminal domain at specific protease recognition motifs is required to release the hormone activity of mis  <cit> . we isolated three transcripts of different sizes for mis. the primer set used was designed against sequence that spans a region of dna that encodes potential enzymatic cleavage recognition residues and that is upstream from the bioactive hormone region of the molecule  . we found expression of a complete sequence , and two alternatively-spliced transcripts of  <dig> and  <dig> bp in length . similar alternatively-spliced variants of mis have also been characterized in the european sea bass  <cit> . the mis  and mis  transcripts terminate  <dig> and  <dig> codons downstream from their putative protease rlrr recognition motifs, respectively . translation of these transcripts thereby does not generate the c-terminal mature hormone portion of salmon mis. only mis  is in-frame to encode the bioactive hormone portion of the gene .

the features of the different mis transcripts may be important for different regulatory capacities, depending on the tissue in which they are expressed. for example, mis  is expressed at relatively high levels in the muscle, skin, gill, spleen, brain and heart; mis  is most "strongly" expressed in the gonad , and mis  is expressed at a relatively low level in most of the male tissues we examined . other potential alternatively-spliced amplicons of mis are observed in several of the female tissues.

in the early development stages, expression of mis was first observed on d <dig> and we did detect the expression of multiple mis amplicons by d <dig> . we attempted to clone and sequence each of these pcr products, but were successful in obtaining information for only the larger  <dig> bp transcript.

alternative splicing of cyp19b <dig> transcripts
during the process of preparing clones for sequencing to confirm their identities, we isolated and sequenced cyp19b <dig> transcripts of three different sizes from d <dig> larvae. previous work demonstrated that at least five different cyp19b <dig> transcripts that bear differences in the lengths of their 5'-utrs are generated in the brain and gonads of rainbow trout  <cit> . we now show similar results for the transcription of cyp19b <dig> transcripts with 5'-utrs of a variety of lengths in atlantic salmon.

the salmon transcript  <dig> utilizes the more conventional intron 1/exon  <dig> splice sites and is devoid of intron  <dig> . transcript  <dig> has been previously identified in the trout brain and gonads  <cit>  and includes a portion of the 3'-end of intron  <dig> of the salmon cyp19b <dig> gene . transcript  <dig> contains an extra  <dig> nts of intron  <dig>  in addition to the most 3'-end of the intron that is included in the 5'-end of transcript  <dig>  this is the first time that a cyp19b <dig> transcript using this more upstream splice site has been reported for a salmonid. each of these distinct mrnas use splice sites that follow the canonical pre-mrna gt-ag rule for intron splicing  <cit> . it is interesting that the cryptic 3'-splice site utilized in transcript  <dig> is bypassed by the spliceosome in favour of the more upstream acceptor ag site in transcript  <dig>  of eight cyp19b <dig> clones isolated from amplifications of d <dig> cdna, six were transcript  <dig> representatives. we presume that other examples of these partial intron 1-containing cyp19b <dig> transcripts exist. however, several of the larger , weaker cyp19b <dig> pcr products detected in the adult tissues were isolated, cloned and sequenced and determined to be non-specific amplifications .

generally, strong 3'-splice sites in vertebrate intronic regions contain a pyrimidine-rich tract and a terminal ag  <cit> . these sequences are important for spliceosome recognition for precise intron removal  <cit> . examining the  <dig> nts preceeding each of the three 3'-splice sites in intron  <dig> of cyp19b <dig> revealed that the conventional intron 1/exon  <dig> junction, the cryptic 3'-splice site and the most upstream splice site had 33% , 53%  and 63%  ct content, respectively . interestingly, the splice site with the least pyrimidine content is that of the more conventional intron 1/exon  <dig> junction. it is therefore possible that the formation of this junction is the least favoured of the three splice sites presented here.

a comparison of the rainbow trout  and atlantic salmon cyp19b <dig> intron  <dig> shows strong conservation in the 5'-and 3'-ends . the central region of the two introns contain indels and are less conserved. interestingly, only one intronic repeat sequence  segment, previously reported as four contiguous blocks of  <dig> nts in the trout  <cit> , was present in the salmon cyp19b <dig> intron  <dig> . the loss of the other three irss in the atlantic salmon comprises almost half of the difference in the sizes between the introns .

the novelty of the cryptic 3'-splicing in the cyp19b <dig> intron  <dig>  suggests this region is a target for regulators that bind signal elements within it to dictate distinct splicing events. interestingly, a cluster of perfect and imperfect core recognition motifs for foxl <dig> aaa-3'  <cit> ) are located in the salmon cyp19b <dig> intron  <dig> . the irs contains at least one potential half-site  that could potentially bind estrogen receptor or retinoic acid receptor-retinoid x receptor heteromers. the irs is also flanked by two everted sf- <dig> motifs that present only one mismatch to the consensus sequence ycaaggycr, where y = t/c and r = g/a .

recent viral and mammalian work has demonstrated that exonic splicing signals exist that can enhance  or suppress  spliceosome recognition for intron splice sites  <cit> . although this class of rna processing signal is ill-defined in fish, we previously identified several putative exonic splicing enhancers and suppressors in exon  <dig> of trout cyp19b <dig>  <cit> . these eses and esss are almost identical in the atlantic salmon cyp19b <dig> exon  <dig> , indicating that this exon contains significantly positioned splicing motifs that could also potentially direct the lengths of the 5'-end of cyp19b <dig> mrnas.

conservation of nucleocytoplasmic transport signals in sox9
the n-terminal high mobility group , dna-binding domain of the characterized salmonid sox- <dig> proteins are highly conserved, even in comparison to the mouse and human sox- <dig> proteins . signals important for the import and export of sox- <dig> between the cytoplasm and the nucleus have been identified  <cit> . in particular, the bipartite and basic cluster nuclear localization signals   <cit> , as well as the leucine-rich nuclear export signal   <cit>  are 100% identical across the species examined . the largest divergence between the mammalian and salmonid sox- <dig> proteins occurs in the c-terminal non-hmg, protein-interface and transactivation domain .

bac organization and regulatory regions
in order to understand more fully the regulatory regions and chromosomal context of specific factors thought to be important in sexual differentiation processes in salmon, we isolated several bacs containing dax <dig> and dax <dig>  foxl2b and mis. once the bacs had been isolated and assembled, we examined approximately  <dig>  kb of sequence in the proximal promoter regions and identified a number of different transcription factor response elements for each gene of interest . as well, the chromosomal environment in which each goi resides is presented in figure  <dig> 

the mammalian dax <dig> promoter contains binding sites for oct3/ <dig>  sox- <dig>  sf- <dig> and other regulatory factors  <cit> . we show both of the salmonid dax promoters contain binding elements for sf- <dig> and sox- <dig> factors, but that only the dax <dig> proximal promoter contains oct3/ <dig> motifs . the possibility exists that these promoters could also be regulated by estrogen receptor since both have potential palindromic eres. other clear differences are discernable in the regulation of these two genes, most notably in the large regions of ct- and ga-rich regions in dax <dig> that are not present in dax <dig> . the ga-rich region is contiguous with a block of dna that contains at least four perfect repeats, each  <dig> nts in length.

we could not identify any canonical sox binding elements in the proximal mis promoter. however, we did detect two potential half-ares and the presence of two sox footprints  <cit>  . several oct3/ <dig>  ppare and wt- <dig> response elements were also identified. as well, typical gc boxes are located in the mis promoter  that could bind sp- <dig> and kruppel-like factors  <cit> .

we found a tetrapartite gcat sequence in the foxl2b promoter that might bind smad factors. smads can act through gcnt, gccg and gcat sequence motifs  <cit> . interestingly, the foxl2b promoter does not contain a strong consensus sf- <dig> binding motif. however, it is possible that a weaker site at - <dig> to - <dig>  could interact with sf- <dig> . we also provide evidence that foxl <dig> may regulate its own expression through several binding sites present in its promoter. numerous potential binding sites for ere, rxr/rar and wt- <dig> are also located in the foxl <dig> promoter.

we also isolated a bac containing the foxl2a pseudogene. the pseudogenic foxl2a mrna, if transcribed, would share similarity with the characterized trout orthologs beginning in regions approximately  <dig> and  <dig> nts downstream from the start codon of the ortholog  and the diverged paralog  . we could find no inframe atg initiation codons for the pseudogene in sequence upstream from these regions. furthermore, multiple stop codons in the pseudogenic reading frame would disable any possible generation of a full-length protein. a comparison of the salmon pseudogene with the trout foxl <dig> open reading frame shows a region of only short identity with the forkhead domain with the n-and c-terminal ends diverging completely . however, we did isolate an amplicon of  <dig> nts that represents the salmon foxl2a based on sequence spanning from the 5'-utr ending just short of the stop codon. we were unable to isolate the bac bearing the viable foxl2a gene, but it has been mapped to linkage group   <dig> and foxl2b has been mapped to lg  <dig> in asalbase  <cit> . the remaining bacs bearing the following genes have been localized to the following chromosomes by fluorescent in situ hybridization  techniques: dax1: chromosome  <dig> ; dax2: chromosome  <dig> ; mis: chromosome  <dig>  .

transposon integration analysis
ssart. <dig>  a non-ltr long interspersed nuclear element  sequence  <cit> , is integrated approximately  <dig>  kbp upstream from the transcription start site of the foxl2a pseudogene . this fragment is truncated at the 5'-end, consistent with partial retrotranscription. additionally, we found a fragment of the tc1-like transposon, dtssa <dig>  <cit> , inserted  <dig> bp upstream from the ssart. <dig> sequence. interestingly, a ssart. <dig> sequence was also found inserted into the centre of the intron of dax <dig> . the gt-ag signals for intron splicing are approximately  <dig> and  <dig> nts up- and downstream, respectively, from this integration. the dax <dig> paralog does not possess any introns. truncated copies of ssart. <dig> are also present in the promoter of dax <dig>  both the dax <dig> and foxl2b promoters appear devoid of any transposon integrations.

discussion
mis
postnatal expression of mis in the early mammalian male gonad leads to male reproductive tract development mediated through regression of the female anlagen  <cit> . the importance of mis to male sexual differentiation is demonstrated by the morphological and endocrine sex reversal of fetal ovaries exposed to mis  <cit> . the expression of mis has been associated with the downregulation of cyp19a in mammals  <cit> , zebrafish  <cit>  and sea bass  <cit> .

we have observed expression of mis in immature and mature ovary and testis of both trout and salmon . the activity of mis was absent only in precocious or prespawn trout testis. in this study, we show expression of mis during early development and in various adult salmon tissues . the expression of mis by d <dig> indicates the potential for a role early in salmonid development. since mis is a glycoprotein member of the tgf β family, it may serve in establishing and shaping different cellular phenotypes well before patterning of the reproductive tissues.

since we observe expression of mis and the absence of cyp19a in most adult tissues , it could be suggested that mis downregulates cyp19a. in contrast, the expression of cyp19b <dig> is evident in most adult tissues. transactivation of cyp19b <dig> may not be reliant on gonadotropic inputs like cyp19a , and therefore could be refractory to inhibition by mis. nevertheless, unlike in mammalian models where mis expression is absent during the onset of sex determination, mis expression is detected in the embryonic gonads of both trout  <cit>  and tilapia  <cit> . although the levels of expression in the female are much lower than in the male during the crucial sex determination window  <cit> , it may still play a role in female development. for example, disruptions to mis signaling have been shown to impact germ cell proliferation and cell-cycle timing in both sexes of medaka  <cit> .

furthermore, in mammalian models, mis is the downstream regulatory target of sox- <dig> activity in the differentiating testis. however, expression of sox9a and sox9b occurs in both the trout male and female gonad during sex determination  <cit> . part of the decoupling of mis expression from sox regulation, at least in salmonids, could be due to the lack of canonical sox binding elements in the proximal mis promoter . another control mechanism that may differ in fish that exists in mammals is that nuclear localization of sox- <dig> occurs in the male , but is absent in the primordial female gonad  <cit> . the subcellular localization signals that have been shown to direct sox- <dig> nucleocytoplasmic shuttling during mammalian male sexual differentiation  <cit>  are highly conserved in salmonid sox- <dig> proteins. whether these signals are targets for sex-specific transport factors; and whether the sox <dig> paralogs are localized to different cell-types, and are involved in differentiation of sertoli precursor cells in salmonids, still remains to be determined.

in mammals, the mis precursor protein consists of two sections - the n-terminal prodomain and the c-terminal, mature hormone region  <cit> . the mammalian studies indicate that the mis precursor protein is proteolytically cleaved at consensus rxxr sites  <cit> . it is not known if fish mis proprotein is similarly proteolytically activated, but the organization and conservation of these motifs across many species does suggest similar mechanisms of hormone bioactivation  <cit> . although the mammalian studies indicate that the n-terminal prodomain section of mis serves only to stabilize and to target the processed hormone  <cit> , our work suggests that some mis transcripts generate only truncated prodomain representatives. the function of these transcripts, in various tissues and during early development, remains to be determined. it is possible that the expression of transcripts that encode the mis prodomain alone may add another level of control for tissue-specific regulation of mis activity, or that they influence the bioactivities of other members of the tgf family, such as bmps, activin or inhibin. heterodimerization between various members of this large family of growth factors has been shown to direct different cell-patterning decisions .

dax
dax- <dig> has been described to be either a possible ovarian- or testicular-determining factor  <cit> . we previously found dax <dig> to be consistently expressed across all reproductive development stages examined in trout ovary and testis  <cit> . although both the salmon dax <dig> and dax <dig> described here were expressed in all adult tissues , the appearance of dax <dig> was at least two weeks before dax <dig> in salmon embryos .

although the interactions that promote the undifferentiated state in embryonic stem  cells are well-established, the events that antagonize them to initiate cellular differentiation are poorly understood. the expression of dax <dig> has been associated with early mammalian es cells in maintaining the undifferentiated state and to safeguard pluripotency  <cit> . oct3/ <dig> and sox- <dig> are also considered "core" transcription factors in the maintenance of pluripotency  <cit> . it has been shown that these factors interact cooperatively to regulate dax <dig> expression in es cells  <cit> . we found putative response elements for oct3/ <dig> and sox factors in the dax <dig> and dax <dig> promoters , that implicate their role in the regulation of the salmonid genes as well.

it also has been proposed that sf- <dig> expression is not coupled to dax <dig> regulation in es cells  <cit> . in this regard, it is also important to note the location of the sox consensus binding elements in close proximity to the sf- <dig> motifs in both salmonid dax promoters . sox binding of its response element may interfere with sf- <dig> binding during early development stages. we also show the expression of sf <dig> no earlier than d <dig>  a period that succeeds a potentially important differentiation transition point  .

regulation of alternative splicing by dax- <dig> and sox factors may control stem cell differentiation, and initiation and development of the gonad  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that dax <dig> inhibits pre-mrna splicing of target genes and that these activities can be restored by the addition of hmg-domain containing factors  <cit> . moreover, it has been proposed that the control of splicing is exerted through competiton between dax- <dig> and sox proteins for splicing factor complexes  <cit> . antagonism between dax- <dig>  and sox- <dig>   <cit>  may be the mechanism whereby "stemness" versus differentiation-associated genes are regulated in es cells. the decline , absence  and reappearance  of dax <dig> we detected  may reflect a transition that results in differentiation of embryonic cell layers in specific developing organs; similar to the different cell lineages that have been shown to arise following dax <dig> downregulation in mouse  <cit> .

foxl2
both foxl <dig> transcripts were found to be expressed very early in development . in the male, we found foxl2a expression to be quite restricted in comparison to the foxl2b diverged paralog, which was present in most adult extragonadal tissues examined . in contrast, expression of foxl2b is quite restricted in the adult female tissues, essentially confined to the skin, gill and ovary. the expression of foxl2b in the testis was also very strong, correlating well with previous findings that showed foxl2b was present, with foxl2a absent, in later stages of testis development in trout  <cit> . taken together, this may indicate that foxl2b is an important regulator of male-specific genes , at least later in development.

the expression of foxl2a is associated with upregulation of ovarian-specific cyp19a and with differentiation of the ovary in many species  <cit> . upregulation of foxl <dig> genes have been correlated with cyp19a expression during ovarian differentiation in trout  <cit> , japanese flounder  <cit>  and nile tilapia  <cit> . depending on the study, transactivation of cyp19a occurs directly through the foxl <dig> binding elements or in concert with sf- <dig>  sf-1-mediated regulation of aromatase activity is modulated by dax- <dig>  which binds sf- <dig> directly  <cit> .

we previously implicated foxl <dig> with the generation of cyp19b <dig> transcripts bearing 5'-ends of different lengths, potentially in complexes with sf- <dig> and dax- <dig>  <cit> . at least two sf- <dig> binding sites and a number of potential foxl <dig> response elements reside in the trout cyp19b <dig> intron  <dig>  because of well-characterized dax- <dig> spliceosome activity , and the association of both dax- <dig> and sf- <dig> with foxl <dig> at aromatase promoters in fish and mammals  <cit> , we hypothesize that complexes of these gene products could also control splicing activity of cyp19b <dig> 

this mechanism of regulatory control in the synthesis of these transcripts is further reinforced by our present characterization of the atlantic salmon cyp19b <dig> intron  <dig>  which maintains many of the features described for the trout cyp19b <dig> intron  <dig>  <cit> . in accord with this model, we demonstrate the generation of differentially spliced, partial intron 1-containing cyp19b <dig> transcripts in salmon. we argue that if dax- <dig>  foxl <dig> and sf- <dig> are known to interact at aromatase promoters, then nucleation at the cyp19b <dig> intron  <dig> is also plausible. strong evidence exists that indicates that various transcription factors and nuclear hormone receptors can bind to rna and regulate rna splicing, migration and localization  <cit> . for example, both dax- <dig> and sf- <dig> have been shown to bind steroid receptor activator  <cit> , a rna that acts as a bridge and platform to nucleate and stabilize transcription complexes. it has been proposed that nuclear receptors, such as sf- <dig>  which can bind dna as monomers, may recognize the ycaaggycr motif in rna . among the various factors that bind rna, recognition for ycaaggycr, as well as for other binding elements, may be through different mechanisms of interaction with the nucleic acid   <cit> .

aromatase
in this study, we confirmed the expression of alternatively-spliced cyp19b <dig> transcripts in only the larvae  and gonad of salmon. however, expression of cyp19b <dig> transcripts of different sizes and abundances are evident in a broad range of adult tissues , such as muscle , skin  and spleen  of the male. whether differences in processing results in partitioning of specific cyp19b <dig> transcripts to distinct tissues remains to be explored.

we also show during early salmon development that at least a three-week delay in the transcription of cyp19a occurs in comparison to cyp19b <dig> . part of these regulatory differences could be dictated by estrogenic or gonadotropic controls . for example, unlike cyp19b promoters, cyp19a promoters lack consensus eres for the fish species characterized to date  <cit> . another important difference between these genes is that sox binding elements, often many of them, are in close proximity to sf- <dig> binding motifs in teleost cyp19a promoters  <cit> . competition between sox factors and foxl <dig> for access to their binding sites on cyp19a promoters could be key to ovarian-specific aromatase synthesis. this is compatible with recent work that shows that the mammalian ovarian phenotype is mediated by cooperative foxl <dig> and er repression of sox <dig> transcription  <cit> ; interactions that are opposed by the binding of sry/sf- <dig> and sox- <dig> in the male pathway  <cit> . further work is needed to define the precise roles that foxl2a and foxl2b play in activation of the two salmonid cyp <dig> genes early in development, as well as their function in the transcription of other promoters.

genome rearrangements
there is a growing body of evidence that demonstrates that past transposon activity has led to salmonid genome remodeling  <cit> . we show the integration of ssart. <dig> very close to the transcription start site of the pseudogenic foxl2a . although speculative, integration of ssart. <dig> into the foxl2a regulatory region may have led to the reorganization of the 5'-end and subsequent accumulation of stop codons into the coding region of this gene. integration of ssart. <dig> into the dax <dig> intron also provides an example of how transposon activity can rearrange genes; potentially leading to the creation of introns and indicating how genes can acquire new functions over time.

CONCLUSIONS
we have found expression of many factors classically associated with sex differentiation in embryonic stages well before sex fate determination. their expression early in development points to the potential for function during embryogenesis. expression of these regulators in diverse adult tissues also indicates their potential role in transcription programs independent of steroidogenesis and gonadogenesis. further investigation is required to determine if these genes are translated in the embryonic and adult stages of development and to localize their expression to specific cell-types. whether these genes are associated with stem cells, or with other differentiation factors in networks that influence cell-patterning throughout development, remain to be unequivocally determined.
