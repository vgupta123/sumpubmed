BACKGROUND
bats are a speciose group which constitute approximately 20% of extant mammals, and are the only mammalian group that have powered flight  <cit> . unlike the bird wing, made up of an elongated radius and ulna and modified wrist and hand bones that support the flight feathers, bat wings are primarily shaped by elongated digits  that support the wing membranes or dactylopatagia   <cit> . this digit elongation is extreme. for their body length, bats have the longest relative digit lengths with the longest digit  exceeding the length of the body. however, not all of the forelimb digits are elongated, digit i - the thumb - maintains a short morphology similar to the hindlimb digits and is used to grasp surface or move on the ground . this unique morphology of the bat forelimb digits has sparked interest and motivated investigation by many developmental and evolutionary biologists. despite these efforts, the mechanisms underlying development of these two distinct digit morphologies  of the bat hand remains unresolved. in this study, we capitalize on variation in digit development morphology within the forelimb and between the fore- and hindlimb in bats to identify candidate genes associated with development of distinct digit morphologies. using dge-tag profiling  of the thumb, the elongated forelimb digits and the hindlimb digits we identified  <dig> candidate genes likely associated with digit elongation and seven candidate genes likely associated with the morphological and functional similarity between the thumb and hindlimb digits.

elongation of the posterior digits  in the bat forelimb is initiated at an early stage when digit anlagen initially appear, embryonic stage  <dig>  <cit> . by embryonic stage  <dig>  the elongation becomes obvious with lengthening of forelimb digits ii-v greatly exceeding that of the thumb and hindlimb digits  <cit> . this rapid elongation of the posterior forelimb digits is thought to results from modification in expression of key developmental genes  <cit> . in fact, several experimental and empirical studies have found differences in expression of limb and digit associated genes between mouse and bat autopodia. first, a mouse transgenic experiment that replaced an enhancer of the mouse prx <dig> - a transcription factor that regulates long bone growth in mouse - with the orthologous putative enhancer sequence from a bat resulted first in an increase in prx <dig> expression and second in a small, but significant elongation of the mouse forelimb digits  <cit> . second, shh, a key factor in limb development, exhibits a unique second phase of signaling late in development of the bat wing that is not present in the development mouse autopodia  <cit> . next, other developmental genes including fgf <dig> and bmp2/ <dig> are up regulated in bat forelimb digits compared to bat hindlimb or mouse digits  <cit> . finally, the distribution hoxd <dig> expression is more posteriorly restricted in the bat forelimb relative to mouse fore- and hindlimbs and bat hindlimbs during late embryonic stages  <cit> . while these results indicate that differences in expression of hoxd <dig>  fgf <dig>  bmp2/ <dig> and prx <dig> during forelimb digit development may contribute to bat digit elongation, the complex developmental changes required to generate the bat wing likely require numerous molecular changes  <cit> . thus, further examinations of gene expression during development of the bat digits are critical to identify the genes associated with digit elongation in the posterior forelimb digits and those responsible for the morphological and functional similarities between the short thumb and hindlimb digits.

here, using a dge-tag profiling approach, we compared patterns of gene expression among three cdna libraries formed from distinct regions of the fetal autopodia  in rickett's big-footed bat, myotis ricketti. the method of dge-tag profiling combines the sage principle with the massively parallel sequencing technology to study genome-wide gene expression profiles  <cit> . dge-tag profiling has three main advantages compared to the conventional microarray technology. first, it is high-throughput sequencing. as a result, data from a single lane of a flow cell  is enough to analyze of genome wide gene expression including weakly expressed genes which cannot be assessed using microarray  <cit> . next, this type of sequencing data is highly replicable and accurate such that technical replicates have little variation  <cit> . finally, sequencing can be performed without a priori sequence information, which is required in microarrays  <cit> . these features of dge-tag profiling aided our identification of genes associated with digit morphology in bats. overall, our examination of differentially expressed genes revealed candidate genes associated with both digit elongation as well as morphological and functional similarities between the thumb and hindlimb digits. finally, our results revealed genes associated with digit position in both limbs.

RESULTS
specimen features
all fetuses obtained were in the "fetal stage" which is the last prenatal stage according to bat embryonic staging systems  <cit> . at this stage, the overall appearance of the embryo is similar to the former stages, but the body size as well as the digit length increases rapidly  <cit> . the genital tubercle had become a vagina or a penis allowing determination of specimen sex. all the specimens used in this study had relatively weak pigmentation indicating an early fetal stage as overall body pigmentation increases as fetal development progresses  <cit> . claws were sharp and keratinized in the thumb and hindlimb digits. crown rump length  and forearm length  for both species were recorded in table  <dig>

statistics of tag sequencing
in total,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> reads  were sequenced from library hand di, library hand dii-v and library foot, respectively. library hand di contains  <dig> distinct tags, library hand dii-v contains  <dig>  and library foot contains  <dig>  these distinct tags and their genomic frequency as well as the raw data were deposited in ncbi gene expression omnibus  database with the accession number . most of the distinct tags  appeared only once ; however, a small number of distinct tags  with frequency higher than  <dig> made up over 63% of all the tags in all three libraries . when sequencing depths reach  <dig> , <dig> total tags, the number of distinct tags discovered  drops dramatically in all the three libraries . from that point, increasing sequence depth results in a slow and stable accumulation of new distinct tags indicating that the sequencing has reached saturation .

differences in expression of genes among the three libraries are indicated in figure  <dig>  in total,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> human genes and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mouse genes were mapped using the tags from the three libraries hand di, hand dii-v and foot. in total,  <dig> % human genes  and  <dig> % mouse genes  were mapped using the tags from the three libraries . some tags mapped to human genes but not mouse genes or vice versa.

dge-tag profiling of marker gene expression
the expression patterns of five marker genes  in the three dge-tag profiling libraries are consistent with previously reported patterns of expression at embryonic earlier stages . we found that expression of tbx <dig> was significantly higher in forelimb digits than the hindlimb digits  and pitx <dig> expression was significantly lower in forelimb than in hindlimb digits . similarly, as expected, we found that expression of meis <dig> and hoxd <dig> were significantly higher in library hand dii-v relative to the other two libraries  and krt <dig> was significantly lower in library hand dii-v relative to the other two libraries .

a, homologs of mouse genes, all others are the homologs of human genes; b, genes expression patterns validated by rt-qpcr; * indicates gene expression in the library is significantly higher or lower than in other two libraries .

differences in gene expression across the libraries
additional files  <dig> and  <dig> list the results of degseq analysis for all the homologs of human  and mouse genes . for the comparison between elongated digits and the short digits, we found that  <dig> homologs of human genes and  <dig> homologs of mouse genes were up regulated in library hand dii-v compared with other two libraries  and  <dig> homologs of human genes and  <dig> homologs of mouse genes were down regulated in library hand dii-v compared with other two libraries . for the comparison between forelimb digits and the hindlimb digits, we found that  <dig> homologs of human genes and  <dig> homologs of mouse genes were down regulated in library foot compared with other two libraries  and  <dig> homologs of human genes and  <dig> homologs of mouse genes were up regulated in library foot compared with other two libraries .

among the differentially expressed genes, we found  <dig> genes likely related to digit elongation based on results of previous studies . the expression of tbx <dig>  tbx <dig>  bmp <dig>  rgmb, smad <dig>  smad <dig>  hoxd <dig>  hoxd <dig>  satb <dig>  hoxa <dig>  twist <dig>  tmeff <dig> and enpp <dig> were significantly higher in library hand dii-v compared with other two libraries, and the expression of nog was significantly lower in library hand dii-v . moreover, our results hightlighted  <dig> genes were likely related to the morphological and functional similarity between the thumb and the hindlimb digits. the levels of tbx <dig>  pitx <dig>  acta <dig>  tnnc <dig>  atp2a <dig>  hrc and myoz <dig> were significantly higher in libraries hand di and foot than in library hand dii-v .

real-time quantitative pcr 
to validate the results of dge-tag profiling, we performed rt-qpcr of  <dig> genes which were differentially expressed between libraries . all  <dig> genes exhibited the same overall expression pattern using the distinct methods . meis <dig>  hoxd <dig>  tbx <dig>  tbx <dig>  bmp <dig>  rgmb, hoxa <dig>  twist <dig>  tmeff <dig> and enpp <dig> showed significantly higher expression in the posterior forelimb digits  compared with the thumb  and all five hindlimb digits . krt <dig>  tbx <dig>  acta <dig> and tnnc <dig> showed significantly higher expression in both the thumb  and all five hindlimb digits  than in the posterior forelimb digits . the fold change in expression among the samples was often lower in rt-qpcr as compared to dge-tag profiling; however, this is not surprising given the differences between the two methods in sensitivity of gene detection as well as the fact that the methods were performed in different species.

discussion
massively parallel sequencing is a powerful technology enabling extensive investigation of gene expression profiles. in this study, we obtained over  <dig>  million sequences of expressed tags from three bat autopodial libraries, including the thumb , the posterior forelimb digits , and all five hindlimb digits . using these data, we compared gene expression profiles among the libraries to identify candidate genes associated with elongation of the posterior forelimb digits . in addition, we examined gene expression patterns associated with the short digit morphology of the thumb and hindlimb digits as well as gene expression patterns associated with the fore- versus the hindlimb digits. the results of dge-tag profiling were validated by examining gene expression in a subset of genes using rt-qpcr.

to assess the reliability of our gene expression profiles, we first examined expression of several genes with previously established expression patterns. we compared expression of tbx <dig> and pitx <dig>  fore- and hindlimb marker genes, in the forelimb and hindlimb digits . consistent with previous studies, we found that expression of tbx <dig> was significantly higher in the forelimb digits and pitx <dig> expression was significantly higher in the hindlimb digits although the embryonic stages used here are much later than those used in previous studies  <cit> . in addition, we compared expression of meis <dig> and hoxd <dig> in the fore- and hindlimb digits. previously published microarray data revealed high levels of expression of these two genes in bat autopodia at stages  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . we found that expression of both genes, meis <dig> and hoxd <dig>  remained significantly higher in library hand dii-v in the fetal stage . finally, krt <dig>  a gene expressed in nails and important for the development of nails, exhibited significantly higher expression in the thumb and hindlimb digits  <cit> . because only the thumb  and the hindlimb digits have claws, we would expect higher expression of krt <dig> in the thumb and hindlimb digits relative to the posterior forelimb digits  that make up the wing.

in addition to comparing our gene expression profiles to genes with known expression patterns, we further validated our results by performing rt-qpcr using  <dig> genes which were identified as being differentially expressed between elongated digits and short digits in dge-tag profiling. with the goal of identifying genes related to wing formation across bat taxa, we collected samples from a different species which belongs to the other suborder of chiroptera . we selected  <dig> genes likely important for wing formation or for the similarity between the thumb and foot digits . all the  <dig> genes exhibited the same overall expression pattern in the rt-qpcr as in the dge-tag profiling . this finding not only provides strong support for the dge-tag profiling method used in this study, but also maintenance of gene expression patterns across these two phylogenetically distant species provides strong support for the role of these genes in digit elongation in the posterior forelimb digits or morphological and functional similarities between the thumb and hindlimb digits.

overall, comparisons of gene expression profiles between digit morphologies and limbs identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes. several interesting patterns have emerged from this data. specifically, we highlight  <dig> genes likely related to wing formation or to morphological and functional similarities between thumb and hindlimb digits . first, we found  <dig> genes that are likely associated with digit elongation in bats - two tbx genes , five genes from the bmp pathway , four homeobox genes  and three other gene  related to either digit malformation or cell proliferation. next, we identified seven genes  that are likely associated with the morphological and functional similarities between the thumb and hindlimb digits. expression patterns of these genes in the three distinct digit libraries as well as known function of these genes are described in detail below.

genes associated with digit elongation
in general, tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> belong to t-box gene family and are involved in skeletogenesis  <cit> . in digit formation specifically, tbx <dig> is thought to modulate posterior digit identity through shh and bmp signaling, and tbx <dig> insufficiency causes cousin syndrome which includes congenital dwarfism, moderate brachydactyly  and leg shortening  <cit> . mutants of tbx <dig> have reduced bone size and changes in bone shape in the forelimb skeleton indicating an important role in the skeletal development of forelimbs  <cit> .

bmp <dig>  rgmb, smad <dig>  smad <dig> and nog are all components of the bmp pathway, a pathway critical for bone formation  <cit> . bmp <dig> belongs to the transforming growth factor-beta  superfamily and stimulates cell proliferation and differentiation in a concentration dependent fashion  <cit> . overexpression of bmp <dig> in the chick wing bud has be shown to result in an increase in cell proliferation resulting in lengthening of skeletal elements  <cit> . rgmb, also named as dragon, enhances bmp signaling by directly binding to bmp proteins including bmp <dig>  <cit> . overexpression of bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> in the developing chick limb leads to a dramatic increase in the volume of cartilage elements  <cit> . in addition, bmp2/ <dig> has been shown to be up regulated in the bat forelimb embryonic digits relative to both mouse forelimb digits and bat hindlimb digits  <cit> . this up-regulation is correlated with increased rate of cartilage proliferation  <cit> . beyond up-regulation of bmps themselves, smad <dig> mediates bmp signaling. specifically, in its phosphorylated state smad <dig> forms a complex with smad <dig> and then accumulates in the nucleus. this smad complex regulates transcription of several target genes  <cit> . embryonic manipulation of smad <dig> has confirmed that its expression at the phalanx-forming region influences digit identity in the chick limb  <cit> . in addition, cartilage-specific knockout of smad <dig> and smad <dig> reduce chondrocyte proliferation and increase apoptosis resulting in defects of limb elements in the mouse  <cit> . while all the components of the bmp pathway mentioned above stimulate cartilage formation, nog is an antagonist of bmps and as such inhibits cartilage formation  <cit> . mutations of nog disturb the balance of bmp signaling leading to brachydactyly  <cit> . thus, our results - exhibiting up regulation of bmp <dig>  rgmb, smad <dig>  smad <dig> and down regulation of nog in the elongated bat forelimb digits - suggest a role for bmp signaling in the lengthening of the posterior bat forelimb digits.

hoxd <dig>  hoxd <dig>  hoxa <dig> and satb <dig> are homeobox genes which specify the anterior-posterior axis and have been implicated as digit identity determining genes  <cit> . although hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig> mainly contribute to proximal limb development and are only mildly expressed in the developing digits, we found that hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig> were highly expressed in bat wing digits ii-v relative to the thumb and hindlimb digits  <cit> . our results also indicate that the homeobox gene satb <dig> and hoxa <dig> were highly expressed in bat wing digits ii-v relative to the thumb and hindlimb digits. these two genes are highly expressed in cancer cells promoting tumor growth  <cit> . to our knowledge, there are no studies examining expression of satb <dig> and hoxa <dig> in limb development making them interesting genes for future investigation.

similarly to satb <dig> and hoxa <dig>  tmeff <dig> and enpp <dig> are up regulated in carcinomas  <cit> . previous study showed tmeff <dig> contributes to cell proliferation. enpp <dig> which is expressed in precartilaginous condensations can be strongly activated by hoxa <dig> and hoxd <dig> which are crucial factors for digit identity and development  <cit> . finally, knowledge of the role of twist <dig> and the digit development comes from pathological studies  <cit> . mutations twist <dig> have been found in patients with saethre-chotzen syndrome which is associated with digit malformation  <cit> . overexpression of twist <dig> inhibits osteoblast differentiation and prevents premature fusion of skeletons  <cit> .

genes associated with similarities between the thumb and hindlimb digits
in addition to genes related to bat digit elongation, we found several genes that may contribute to the morphological and functional similarities between the bat thumb and hindlimb digits. first, tbx <dig> and pitx <dig> are primarily associated with hindlimb development. tbx <dig> has also been shown to regulate bone size. specifically, in the developing mouse forelimb, overexpression of these genes results in shortening of the forelimb skeletons  <cit> . next, we found several genes that are likely associated with the distinct musculature and function of the short digits. because the clawed thumb of bats is used to cling to the cave while roosting and the clawed hindlimb digits are used for hanging upside down these digits should be richer in skeletal muscles than the elongated digits. in fact, expression of several skeletal muscle associated genes - acta <dig>  tnnc <dig>  atp2a <dig>  hrc and myoz <dig> - was significantly higher in the thumb and hindlimb digits then in the elongated posterior forelimb digits  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
using genome-wide sequencing method we have identified many genes differentially expressed in the developing digits of the bat autopodia. several of these genes are highly related to digit formation and thus likely play important roles in the development of bat wing. our results provide robust candidate genes for future functional tests and molecular evolution comparison with other mammals to fully understand the mechanisms of wing formation and the evolution of bat flight.
