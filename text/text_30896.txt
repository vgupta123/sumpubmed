BACKGROUND
the family orchidaceae, which contains at least  <dig>  species, is one of the largest families of flowering plants  <cit> . as with all other living organisms, present-day orchids have evolved from ancestral forms as a result of selection pressure and adaptation. orchids show a wide diversity of epiphytic and terrestrial growth forms, and these plants have successfully colonized almost every habitat on earth. the factors promoting the richness of orchid species may include specific interactions between orchid flowers and pollinators  <cit> , sequential and rapid interplay between drift and natural selection  <cit> , obligate orchid-mycorrhizal interactions  <cit> , and epiphytism. the latter mode is the growth form of more than 70% of all orchids  <cit> , which comprise approximately two-thirds of the epiphytic flora of the world.

expansion of diversity may have taken place more quickly in the orchid family than in most other flowering plant families, which had already started to diversify in the mid-cretaceous  <cit> . the time at which orchids originated is disputed, but it has been suggested to be 80- <dig> million years ago    <cit> . recently, the orchidaceae were dated using an amber fossil of an orchid pollinia on the back of the pollinator, a stingless bee  <cit> . the most recent common ancestor of extant orchids is believed to have lived in the late cretaceous   <cit> . perhaps the only general statement that can be made about the origin of orchids is that most extant groups are probably very young.

orchids are known for the diversity of their specialized reproductive and ecological strategies. formation of the labellum and gynostemium  to facilitate pollination has been thoroughly documented, and the co-evolution of orchid flowers and pollinators thereof is well understood  <cit> . the successful evolutionary progress of orchids may be explained by the packaging of mature pollen grains as pollinia, the pollination-based regulation of ovary/ovule development, the synchronized timing of micro- and mega-gametogenesis for effective fertilization, and the release of thousands or millions of immature embryos  in a mature capsule  <cit> . however, despite the unique aspects of developmental reproductive biology and the specialized pollination and ecological strategies of orchids, relatively few molecular studies have focused on orchids compared to other species-rich plant families  <cit> .

the genomic sequence resources for orchids are limited. a number of studies have used sanger sequencing to develop expressed sequence tag  resources for orchids  <cit> . these works have highlighted the usefulness of cdna sequencing in the discovery of candidate genes for orchid floral development  <cit> , floral scent production  <cit> , and flowering time determination  <cit> , in the absence of a full genomic sequence. however, we do not yet have a comprehensive description of all genes that are expressed in orchids.

hybrids of the genus phalaenopsis are among the top-traded blooming potted plants worldwide. because the plants possess favorable commercial traits, such as numerous spikes and branches, along with many colorful flowers, p. equestris is often used as a parent for breeding in its native taiwan. p. equestris is a diploid plant with  <dig> chromosomes  that are small and uniform in size   <cit> . the plant has an estimated haploid genome size of  <dig>  mb , which is relatively small compared to those of other members of the genus phalaenopsis  <cit> . public databases of floral bud ests from p. equestris and p. bellina have been developed and analyzed  <cit> ; they provide valuable opportunities for researchers to directly access genes of interest  <cit>  and to identify molecular markers useful in marker-assisted breeding programs or cultivar identification . however, we still lack basic information on the sequence, organization, and structure of the phalaenopsis genome.

one efficient and viable strategy for gaining insight into the sequence content and complexity of the phalaenopsis genome is afforded by the construction of bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries and end-sequencing of randomly selected bac clones. such bac end sequences  can be used as a primary scaffold for genome shotgun-sequence assembly and to generate comparative physical maps  <cit> . analysis of bes data can provide an overview of the sequence composition of a novel genome, yielding information on gene density, and the presence of potential transposable elements  and microsatellites  <cit> . in addition, bess can identify molecular markers that may be used for genomic mapping and cloning, and in phylogenetic analysis. even for the rice genome, which has been fully sequenced, the oryza map alignment project  constructed deep-coverage large-insert bac libraries from  <dig> wild and  <dig> cultivated african oryza species ; clones from these  <dig> bac libraries were next fingerprinted and end-sequenced. the resulting data were used to construct physical maps of the oryza species to permit studies on evolution, genome organization, domestication, gene regulatory networks, and efforts toward crop improvement  <cit> . however, such work has not yet been performed in orchids.

in the present study, we analyzed  <dig>  bess of two genomic bac libraries of p. equestris, focusing on simple sequence repeat  or microsatellite content, repeat element composition, gc content, and protein-encoding regions. the annotated bess reported herein offer the first detailed insights into the sequence composition of the p. equestris genome, and should be a useful resource for future molecular marker development.

RESULTS
bac end sequencing
two large-insert bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries were used for end-sequencing in the present study. one library, constructed from a partial hindiii digest of p. equestris genomic dna, consisted of  <dig>  clones with an average insert size of  <dig> kb. the other library, constructed from a partial bamhi digest, consisted of  <dig>  clones with an average insert size of  <dig> kb. the two libraries represent approximately  <dig>  equivalents of the wild-type phalaenopsis haploid genome.

dna samples extracted from  <dig>  bac clones  were sequenced from both ends using applied biosystems  big dye terminator chemistry followed by analysis on abi  <dig> machines. the success rate was  <dig> %. after ambiguous, vector, and mitochondrial dna sequences were omitted,  <dig>  high-quality bess remained; these included  <dig>  paired-end reads . the bess ranged in size from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp  and corresponded to a total length of  <dig> , <dig> bp, which is equivalent to  <dig> % of the p. equestris genome . the  <dig>  bess could be assembled into  <dig> contigs  and  <dig>  singletons . in terms of read-length distribution, 800- <dig> bp and 900- <dig> bp were the most abundant categories, accounting for  <dig>   and  <dig>   of all bess, respectively . the gc content was  <dig> %; this is comparable to the  <dig> % previously estimated by buoyant density analysis of the genomic dna of p. amabilis blume   <cit> , indicating that the phalaenopsis genome is at-rich. buoyant density analysis has also been used to study brassica maculate r. br. , cattleya schombocattleya lindl. , and cymbidium pumilum swartz cv. "gareth latangor" , which had gc contents of  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively  <cit> . thus, the available evidence suggests that most orchids have at-rich genomes. all bes sequences generated herein have been deposited in genbank under accession numbers hn176659-hn <dig> 

database sequence searches
the p. equestris bess were subjected to sequence homology analysis using the repbase and tigr plant repeat databases, and repeatmasker and blast were employed to predict repeat sequences and potential tes, respectively. a total of  <dig>  bess  were found to harbor putative tes and repeats. the bess were also repeatmasked and compared to data in the ncbi non-redundant protein databases. a total of  <dig>  were found to contain protein-coding sequences; of these,  <dig> bess  contained putative chloroplast dna-encoded genes .

analysis of repetitive dna in the bess
the large genome size of p. equestris  implies that the content of repetitive dna could be high, rendering the genome more similar to that of maize than rice. the  <dig> bess containing apparent chloroplast sequences were removed from analysis, and the remaining  <dig>  bess were screened for repetitive dna sequences, using repeatmasker and the tigr plant repeat database. as for other eukaryotic genomes, that of phalaenopsis was found to contain a significant proportion of repeat sequences and potential tes;  <dig>  bess  contained such tes . this percentage was higher than that of apple   <cit> , but lower than that of citrus clementina   <cit> , carrot   <cit> , or musa acuminata   <cit> .

among the  <dig>  bess containing potential tes, more showed sequence homology to class i retrotransposons  than to class ii dna transposons , suggesting a ~7: <dig> class i:class ii ratio in the genome . the class i retrotransposons could be further classified into ty1/copia  and ty3/gypsy  long-terminal-repeat  retrotransposons; line  and sine  non-ltr retrotransposons; and other unclassified retrotransposons  . clearly, the ltr retrotransposons outnumbered those of the non-ltr form ; the number of unclassified retrotransposons . the next most abundant dna repeat type was class ii dna transposons, which included ac/ds , en/spm , mutator , tourist, harbinger, helitron, mariner , and other unclassified transposons . in total,  <dig>  bess were found to contain class i retrotransposons and class ii dna transposons. the other identified repeat sequences included miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements , centromere-related sequences , ribosomal rna genes , and other unclassified repeat sequences . in total, such dna was included in  <dig> bess  .

functional annotation
to identify protein-encoding regions, comparison of repeatmasked bess with the ncbi non-redundant protein databases revealed that  <dig> sequences  contained apparent protein-encoding dna . of these,  <dig>  showed top blast matches search homologies to proteins from v. vinifera, whereas  <dig>  best-matched proteins of o. sativa . this finding is consistent with blast data on orchid floral bud ests, which yielded top matches to v. vinifera followed by o. sativa  <cit> . at first glance, it seems very odd that orchid genes appear to be more highly related to a phylogenetically distant dicot species than to another monocot. accumulation of additional orchid sequence data is needed to clarify this point.

blastn was used to compare the  <dig> bess containing protein-encoding sequences to the sequences contained in our orchid est databases  <cit> . we found that  <dig> bess  yielded matches and are known to be expressed in orchids , whereas  <dig>  did not show sequence matches when compared with the orchid est databases.

based on the fact that  <dig> predicted protein-encoding sequences covered  <dig>  kb of the phalaenopsis genome, as identified from  <dig>  bess, gene density analysis predicted that a gene should occur in every  <dig>  kb of the phalaenopsis genome. by comparison, banana  has a gene density of  <dig>  kb  <cit> , rice  is predicted to have a gene every  <dig>  kb  <cit> , whereas a. thaliana is thought to have a gene every  <dig>  kb  <cit> .

the  <dig> bes-derived sequences showing homology to proteins in the ncbi non-redundant protein database were subjected to gene ontology  annotation, and divided into three categories: cellular components , molecular functions , and biological processes . among the  <dig> bess in the cellular components category,  <dig>  corresponded to chloroplast proteins,  <dig>  to membrane proteins, and  <dig>  to other cellular components. however, more than half of these bess  encoded unknown cellular component proteins . sequences in the molecular functions category were distributed as follows:  <dig> %  of unknown molecular function,  <dig> %  with transferase activities,  <dig> %  with other enzymatic activities, and  <dig> %  with involvement in nucleotide binding . among the  <dig> bess in the biological processes category, more than half corresponded to proteins involved in unknown biological processes , whereas the rest were associated with other cellular processes , protein metabolism , or transport functions  .

blastx  was used to compare the repeatmasked bess to the protein databases of o. sativa  and v. vinifera . of the  <dig>  bess,  <dig>  were homologous to v. vinifera proteins. thus, based on an estimated genome size of  <dig>  mb for p. equestris, it may be predicted that the total coding sequences of the p. equestris genome might represent approximately  <dig>  mb. if an average gene length of  <dig>  kb, as in v. vinifera  <cit> , is assumed, an estimate of the total gene content of the p. equestris genome is  <dig> . when the rice genome was used for comparison,  <dig> phalaenopsis bess showed matches to the rice protein database, accounting for  <dig> % of rice proteins. similar estimations indicate that protein-encoding sequences cover  <dig>  mb of the phalaenopsis genome and, assuming an average gene length of  <dig>  kb in oryza  <cit> , predict that the phalaenopsis genome contains  <dig>  genes. these values are comparable to the  <dig>  protein-encoding genes identified in the 487-mb grape genome  <cit>  and the  <dig>  protein-encoding genes found in the 389-mb rice genome  <cit> . notably, gene distribution is fairly homogeneous along the chromosomes of rice and arabidopsis, but genes are distributed more heterogeneously in v. vinifera. pachytene karyotyping analyses of the p. equestris genome showed that the distribution of heterochromatin was pericentromeric, suggesting that genes of the phalaenopsis orchids are more homogeneously distributed . based on the genome size of phalaenopsis, we believe that both average gene length and gene distribution may be similar to those of the rice genome, and that approximately  <dig>  heterogeneously distributed genes may be present.

simple sequence repeats 
we identified  <dig> ssrs or microsatellites accounting for  <dig> % of the obtained bess , and containing various repeat types . bess from arabidopsis thaliana, brassica napus, m. acuminata, o. sativa, v. vinifera, and zea mays were downloaded and analyzed in parallel with those of p. equestris. dinucleotide repeats, which are the most abundant repeat type in m. acuminata , b. napus , and v. vinifera , were also the most common in the p. equestris genome, accounting for  <dig> % of all ssrs. the next most common repeat type in p. equestris was mononucleotide in nature  . in addition, penta- and tri-nucleotide repeats accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, of all ssrs in the p. equestris genome . among the mononucleotide repeats, far more a/t repeats  than g/c repeats   were evident. among the dinucleotide repeats, at/ta was the most abundant , followed by ag/ct , ac/gt , and cg/gc  . the average distance between ssrs was estimated to be  <dig>  kb. interestingly, this is the highest ssr frequency seen among plant genomes analyzed to date, including those of arabidopsis, rapeseed , banana , rice, grape, and maize, which are estimated to have an average of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig>  kb, respectively, between ssrs . in p. equestris, grape, b. napus, and banana, dinucleotides were found to be the most abundant motifs, whereas trinucleotide ssrs predominated in rice and maize. a. thaliana was particularly rich in mononucleotide repeats. we noted some among-study variations in reported frequencies  <cit> ; these appear to be mainly attributable to the use of different criteria for identifying ssrs. however, we can generally conclude that p. equestris and dicot plants such as grapevine, b. napus, and a. thaliana contain a high proportion of at-rich motifs. the greatest repeat number  identified to date is found in the orchid genome , whereas other monocots, such as o. sativa and z. mays, appear to contain lower proportions of at-rich motifs .

ssr markers have been widely used for genotyping of crop plant species  <cit> . of the  <dig> detected ssrs, we chose  <dig> for use in primer design , and subsequently assessed whether the primers could successfully distinguish  <dig> phalaenopsis species, based on allelic polymorphisms. more than 85% of primer pairs successfully amplified products from at least  <dig> of the  <dig> tested phalaenopsis species, all of which have been extensively used as parents in breeding programs . the cross-species transferability rate of the tested ssrs ranged from  <dig> -  <dig> % , and most primer pairs produced polymorphic bands in the majority of tested phalaenopsis species . in a future study, we will examine the efficacy of such ssr markers for genotyping of commercial orchid cultivars.

comparative mapping of orchid bac ends to other plant genomes for identification of microsynteny
to examine syntenic relationships between orchid and other plant species, orchid bess were blast-searched against the whole-genome sequences of a. thaliana, rice , poplar , and grape . bac end pairs of appropriate orientation and no more than 50- <dig> apart on any given chromosome were considered to be potentially collinear with the target genome. our results revealed that  <dig> phalaenopsis bess, including  <dig> end-pair sequences, yielded hits in the poplar genome. twelve pairings mapped together on various chromosomes, but only  <dig> such pair was found within 50- <dig> kb of another, suggesting colinearity . the next greatest number of hits was obtained when the grape genome was compared with that of our bess; significant hits were obtained for  <dig> bess, including  <dig> bac end-pairs,  <dig> of which mapped together on various chromosomes. one of the  <dig> bac end-pairs was found on different contigs of the same chromosome; presumably these contigs are mutually close, maybe even within 50- <dig> kb . ninety-four orchid bess, including  <dig> paired ends, showed significant hits to the arabidopsis genome. eleven of the bac end-pairs colocalized on various chromosomes, but none were less than 50- <dig> kb apart . the mapping of orchid bess to the genome of rice produced  <dig> bes hits, including six paired ends that colocalized on various chromosomes, but were not within 50- <dig> kb of each other .

a the whole-genome sequence data of v. vinifera shows that each individual chromosome contains several contigs. thus, we were unable to determine the exact distances between the bac pair ends that mapped together on the various chromosomes of the grape genome.

the simple monte carlo test  <cit>  was used to assess the statistical significance of the microsynteny results. the sequences of each phalaenopsis bes were randomly shuffled  <dig> times to obtain  <dig>  simulated sequences, which were next blastn- compared to the genomic sequences of poplar, grape, rice, and arabidopsis. none of the simulated sequences mapped to the genomes of the various plants, suggesting that our results with respect to microsynteny mapping of orchid bess onto other plant genomes are meaningful.

most paired ends that mapped together on plant chromosomes were annotated as ribosomal dna ; these sequences accounted for  <dig> of  <dig> end-pairs in poplar,  <dig> of  <dig> in grape and arabidopsis, and all  <dig> end-pairs of rice. in addition, all end-pairs that contained rdna mapped to a single chromosome in each plant species.

twenty-nine orchid bess containing phalaenopsis chloroplast genome sequences showed matches with genomic sequences of the four plant genomes:  <dig> bess with the grape genome,  <dig> with the rice genome,  <dig> with the poplar genome, and  <dig> with the arabidopsis genome . moreover, such bess also showed matches within chloroplast dna sequences from the four plant genomes:  <dig> with the grape genome,  <dig> with rice,  <dig> with poplar, and  <dig> with arabidopsis . transfer of chloroplast dna to the nucleus is well-known to result in insertion of chloroplast dna into nuclear chromosomes. in rice, 421- <dig> chloroplast insertions have been identified throughout the  <dig> chromosomes, forming  <dig> - <dig> % of the rice nuclear genome  <cit> . in the present work, the  <dig> orchid bess containing phalaenopsis chloroplast dna included  <dig> paired and  <dig> unpaired bes end sequences. this suggests that at least some of these bess may be located in the phalaenopsis nuclear genome, rather than representing experimental contamination with chloroplast dna.

previous reports found negligible colinearity between onion  and rice   <cit> . the asparagales include a number of economically important plants, such as asparagus, chives, garlic, leeks, onions, and orchids. similarly, the well-documented high-level synteny among grass genomes is not found among members of other monocot orders , even though microsynteny persisted beyond the time of divergence of the commelinid orders poales and zingiberales  <cit> . in the present work, we failed to find any syntenic relationship between orchid and rice sequences, confirming the previously noted lack of synteny between asparagales and poales.

whole-genome duplication, resulting in polyploidy, occurred in early monocots such as the poales and zingiberales  <cit> . duplication, and gene loss and rearrangements occurring after such whole-genome duplication, led to subsequent evolution and increases in morphological complexity. this may also have occurred in the orchid genome, as suggested by the presence of the four ap3-like paralogs that form the basis for the complicated floral morphologies of phalaenopsis  <cit> . interestingly, these paralogs are present in at least four out of the five subfamilies of the orchidaceae  <cit> . future whole-genome sequencing of phalaenopsis should provide additional insights into genome reorganization and help to clarify differences in genomic composition between orchids and other plant species.

CONCLUSIONS
this analysis of phalaenopsis bac end sequences offers the first insights into the composition of the phalaenopsis genome in terms of gc content, transposable elements present, protein-encoding regions, ssrs, and potential microsynteny between phalaenopsis and other plant species. the protein sequence similarities between phalaenopsis and grape and the potential microsynteny between phalaenopsis and poplar are interesting and should be confirmed by large-scale bac end sequencing. the present work also provides a good basis for additional sequence analysis of phalaenopsis bac libraries, and will also encourage contig fingerprinting and physical mapping of the phalaenopsis genome.
