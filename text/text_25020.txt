BACKGROUND
myb proteins represent a diverse and widely distributed class of eukaryotic transcription factors. in plants, myb genes constitute a very large family encompassing  <dig> members in arabidopsis thaliana for instance. such large families are also observed in rice  and grape , with no less than  <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively  <cit> . plant myb proteins are involved in the regulation of numerous physiological processes  <cit>  and are for example notoriously known to regulate the phenylpropanoid pathway, allowing the biosynthesis of flavonoid, stilbenes and lignin compounds  <cit> .

it is now well established that myb proteins involved in the regulation of the anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin  pathways act synergistically with bhlh partners  and wd-repeat proteins  to enhance the expression of structural genes . such tripartite myb-bhlh-wdr  complexes were found to regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in petunia flowers  <cit>  and pa accumulation in arabidopsis seed coat  <cit> . in grapevine, several branches of flavonoid biosynthesis are under the transcriptional control of different mybs proteins  <cit> . among them, two myb transcription factors, vvmyb5a and vvmyb5b, contribute to the transcriptional regulation of the common parts of the pathway  <cit> . vvmyb5b is expressed in grape berry during pa synthesis in seeds and anthocyanin accumulation in skin. in tobacco, vvmyb5b ectopic expression resulted in accumulation of anthocyanins and pas in flowers , with no visible changes in vegetative organs  <cit> . as previously described in arabidopsis and petunia, myb transcription factors require a bhlh partner for the trans-activation of flavonoid structural genes  <cit> . recently, two bhlh transcription factors  and two wdr proteins  have been identified in grapevine  <cit> . vvmyb5b interacts in yeast and in planta with vvmyc <dig>  <cit> . thus, in grape berry, the interplay between each component of the mbw complex was proposed to control the spatiotemporal distribution of each class of flavonoid compounds. in this spatiotemporal control, three components must play a critical role:  the presence of the proteins at a given time in a given tissue,  the dna binding affinity of each of these proteins for their target genes, and  the specific combination between partners that will result in the activation of a specific structural gene expression. although the protein-protein interaction between myb and bhlh proteins has been already investigated in vitro  <cit> , the mechanisms underlying the formation of the whole mbw transcriptional complex have not been identified yet. in this complex, myb proteins play a critical role in the determination of cis-elements and thus contribute to the selection of target genes. however, the affinity between myb proteins and cis-elements may partly depend on the nature of the interacting bhlh partner, taking in account the fact that the interaction can modify the structural conformation of the myb dna-binding domain  <cit> .

myb proteins are characterized by the presence of an extremely well conserved n-terminal domain that contains up to three imperfect r repeats  of about  <dig> amino acid residues each. these repeats, which contain three alpha-helices, adopt a common conformation named helix-turn-helix motives. structural studies of three repeats in the vertebrate c-myb have shown that both r <dig> and r <dig> are required for sequence-specific binding while r <dig> is not involved in the sequence recognition  <cit> . in each repeat, the three alpha-helices are stabilized by a hydrophobic core that includes three regularly spaced tryptophan residues. within the r <dig> and r <dig> repeats, the c-terminal helix is involved in the dna specific recognition process and the protein insertion into the dna major groove. it has been suggested that the recognition helix of r <dig> specifically interacts with the core of the myb-binding sequence . in contrast, the r <dig> c-terminal helix is supposed to interact less specifically with adjacent nucleotides  <cit> . finally, the r <dig> repeat has also been proposed to provide a platform for protein-protein interactions, especially with bhlh cofactors  <cit> .

mutations altering protein-protein interactions between any member of the ternary complex without affecting their inherent properties  not only will be of significant value in terms of improving fundamental knowledge of such protein complexes but may also be useful to propose innovative engineering strategies to enhance the biosynthesis of specific secondary metabolites in plant system models. in grapevine, the broader regulatory impact of vvmyb5b compared to more specific transcription factors such as vvmyba <dig> or vvmybpa <dig> and  <dig> makes it as potential candidate for such engineering strategy  <cit> . in this study, we investigated the consequences of a single amino-acid substitution located on the third helix of the r <dig> domain on the transcriptional regulatory properties of vvmyb5b  <cit> . based on structural homology studies with the c-myb protein, we choose to replace a positively charged arginine in position  <dig> from the native protein  by a neutral leucine . effects of conformational changes on the dna-binding and the trans-regulation properties of the mutated vvmyb5bl protein were investigated in yeast and in grape suspension cells and compared to those of the native protein. vvmyb5br and vvmyb5bl capabilities to physically interact with the bhlh protein vvmyc <dig> were assessed using two-hybrid assays in yeast. finally, overexpression of vvmyb5bl in tobacco was performed to estimate the in planta impact of the mutation on the array of vvmyb5br target genes. taken together, our results highlight the importance of dimerization between myb and bhlh factors for the selectivity of target genes.

RESULTS
structural model of vvmyb5b r2r <dig> domain
the vitis vinifera myb5b gene encodes a myb-like protein containing two imperfect repeats  and an interaction domain  with bhlh protein partners  <cit>  . the alignment of the vvmyb5b sequence with myb transcription factors already characterized in grape  confirms the high sequence homology of the myb domains . the sequence identity remains very high  when compared with the r <dig> and r <dig> repeats of mouse c-myb, a protein with its 3d structure already characterized in its free state or in complex with dna  <cit> . groups of highly conserved residues have been assigned key roles in the structure and function of these proteins: a first group of residues located at the c-terminal parts of the r <dig> and r <dig> domains is involved in interactions with dna. a second group, located at the n-terminal part of domain r <dig>  interacts with bhlh protein partners as described above  <cit> . finally, a third group includes residues responsible for the ternary structure of the protein: in each domain, several charged residues establish salt bridges between α-helices which maintain their relative orientations, whereas hydrophobic residues form a hydrophobic core buried within the three α-helices  <cit> .

a structural model of vvmyb5b was built  using the crystallographic coordinates of the mmc-myb r2-r <dig> domain  as starting model. the resulting model appears very close to the template model with a root-mean-square deviation  of superimposed cα of  <dig>  Å for  <dig> aligned residues. as visualized in figure 1b, all four salt bridges observed in mmc-myb are strictly conserved in vvmyb5b and adopt the same conformations, with the exception, in domain r <dig>  of the interaction d88-y <dig>  which is substituted by a d152-h <dig> interaction in the mmc-myb protein. within domain r <dig>  residue r <dig> is involved in a conserved salt bridge and was chosen as a target for single point mutation for the following reasons:  the salt bridge appears to be strictly conserved in all myb sequences  and does not interact with bhlh partners  <cit> ;  its counterpart in mmc-myb  was shown to interact with phosphate groups of target dna  <cit>  to facilitate dna binding;  d <dig>  the partner of r <dig> in the salt bridge, appears to be far enough from any other residue from the r <dig> domain c-terminal α-helix to avoid establishing a new stabilizing interaction. in addition, r <dig> also takes part in the stacking of several side chains, i.e. r <dig>  w <dig>  r <dig> and y <dig>  which certainly participates to the 3d structure arrangement of the r <dig> domain . a similar situation has been observed in mmc-myb with the residues r <dig>  w <dig>  r <dig> and h <dig> 

therefore, the arginine in position  <dig> of vvmyb5b was replaced by a leucine neutral residue. the resulting mutation, named r69l and located nearby the dna binding domain , appeared likely to modify the interaction with the dna backbone and the protein activity by disrupting the ternary structure of the transcription factor itself.

the r69l mutation reduces vvmyb5b trans-activation capacity in yeast
an assay was conducted to determine whether the r69l mutation affects vvmyb5b trans-activation properties in yeast. as shown in figure  <dig>  yeasts transformed with the vvmyb5br effector construct exhibited a 5-fold increase in β-galactosidase activity compared to yeasts that express vvmyb5bl. nevertheless, vvmyb5bl was still functional despite a growth delay on solid selective medium  compared to vvmyb5br recombinant yeasts that were able to develop  <dig> days after transformation . indeed, vvmyb5bl could activate lacz expression  <dig> times more than the gal4-dbd itself. these results indicate that  vvmyb5b can activate transcription in yeast and  that the r69l substitution significantly reduces vvmyb5b transcriptional activities.

vvmyb5bl no longer activates transcription of a flavonoid structural gene in grape cells
as for many other myb proteins, vvmyb5b requires co-expression of both bhlh and wdr protein partners, i.e. ategl <dig>  and atttg <dig> respectively, to up-regulate target gene expression  <cit> . thus, a dual luciferase assay was conducted to assess the effect of the r69l substitution on vvmyb5b ability to activate the vvchi promoter in grape cells, in the presence or the absence of bhlh and wdr proteins.

as shown in figure  <dig>  co-transformation with vvmyb5br effector plasmid and vvchi reporter construct, together with the wd <dig> protein atttg <dig>  resulted in a 5-fold increase of luciferase activity, as compared to the control . presence of ategl <dig> increased the transcriptional activity of vvmyb5br up to 18-fold. in contrast, same experiments with vvmyb5bl showed that vvmyb5bl was not able to activate vvchi promoter in the presence of atttg <dig> . in the same way, co-transformation using vvmyb5bl construct with ategl <dig> and atttg <dig> did not increase the luciferase activity. altogether, these results show that, in grapevine cells, vvmyb5bl no longer displayed any transcriptional activation of the vvchi promoter in the presence of the two imposed proteins from arabidopsis, ategl <dig> and atttg <dig> 

the r69l substitution abolishes vvmyb5b interaction with a bhlh partner
a yeast two-hybrid assay was conducted to investigate the ability of vvmyb5bl to physically interact with a putative vitis bhlh partner. our results  confirmed that vvmyb5br could interact with vvmyc <dig>  as previously described  <cit> . on the other hand, vvmyb5bl was not able to form dimers with vvmyc <dig> to activate lacz expression.

in addition, the ability of the vvmyb5br and vvmyb5bl proteins to bind mbs  cis-elements was evaluated using emsa . both proteins were synthesized by an in vitro transcription and translation assay and biotinylated protein bands were detected by a chemiluminescent assay . the results showed that both proteins accumulated in identical ways and are not degraded. however, neither native vvmyb5br nor mutated vvmyb5bl could bind mbs sequences using emsa. likewise, none of both proteins  was able to bind the vvchi promoter sequence in yeast one-hybrid experiments .

flavonoid biosynthesis genes are differentially expressed in flowers of vvmyb5br or vvmyb5bl transgenic tobacco lines
vvmyb5br and vvmyb5bl coding sequences were ectopically expressed in tobacco plants under the control of the 35s constitutive promoter. three t <dig> homozygous independent lines tested for each construct were used for further investigations. analyses were only carried out on flowers since no phenotypic differences were detected at the vegetative level. corolla and stamens of 35s::vvmyb5br tobacco flowers exhibited a strong red pigmentation and a purple color, which was associated with higher anthocyanidin accumulation not observed in control plants  <cit> . by contrast, flowers of tobacco plants over-expressing vvmyb5bl did not exhibit a greater accumulation in anthocyanidin in both flower organs  and no significant changes of anthocyanin content were observed in corolla and stamens . to tentatively explain these phenotypes, transcript abundances of three tobacco flavonoid biosynthetic genes , dihydroflavonol 4-reductase  and anthocyanidin synthase ) were monitored by quantitative rt-pcr  to identify in planta target structural genes of vvmyb5b together with the impact of the mutation on the expression of these same genes. as shown in figure 5b, none of these genes was expressed in stamens of control plants, which is consistent with the fact that anthocyanins are not normally synthesized in this particular tissue. as previously described in  <cit> , overexpression of vvmyb5br induced higher transcription of ntchs, ntdfr and ntans mrnas together with anthocyanin accumulation in stamens. in corolla cells, ntdfr expression did not appear to be affected but an increase in chs and ans transcript abundances was observed and correlates with an anthocyanin content significantly higher than in control plants.

in contrast, vvmyb5bl overexpression did not enhance ntchs, ntans and ntdfr transcript abundances in stamens although expression levels of transgene for both constructs  were the same. however, vvmyb5bl appeared to retain some trans-activation activity in corolla where ntchs and ntans transcripts abundance was significantly higher than in wild-type plants. in addition, corolla cells expressing vvmyb5bl accumulated significantly more ntdfr transcripts than control and 35s::vvmyb5br plants. surprisingly, this increase in flavonoid genes expression did not affect the anthocyanin concentration in vvmyb5bl corolla . altogether, these results indicate that  vvmyb5bl has severely lost its trans-activation ability in stamens whereas this same regulatory protein was still active in corolla;  vvmyb5bl might have new regulatory functions in corolla cells as its overexpression induced the up-regulation of the ntdfr that was not observed in 35s::vvmyb5br plants.

discussion
over the past two decades, an increasing number of studies investigating the transcriptional regulation of the flavonoid pathway have been published . most of them emphasized the pivotal role of myb transcription factors in the control of this metabolic pathway. more recently, new findings highlighted the importance of a multi-protein complex involving myb proteins with bhlh and wdr partners in the coordination of the transcriptional regulation of flavonoid biosynthetic genes. nevertheless, the way in which this multi-protein complex specifically regulates expression of genes depending on the tissue, the developmental stage or the environmental conditions is not fully understood yet.

the structure of the myb dna-binding domain  interacting with a double dna strand has already been investigated in several models  <cit> . these studies have shown that the third helices of both r <dig> and r <dig> are involved in the recognition of a specific dna consensus sequence  <cit> . in mmc-myb, k <dig>  positioned in the r <dig> domain, together with k <dig> and n <dig> positioned in the r <dig> domain, were identified as key residues in the 'recognition' of the specific nucleotide sequence aacng, the so-called 'myb binding site'  <cit> . later, the same authors demonstrated that the methylene chain of residue r <dig> delimits, with three other amino acids , a cavity in the centre of a hydrophobic core that may play a role in the conformational stability of the r <dig> domain  <cit> . for instance, an amino acid substitution  within this cavity reduces the conformational flexibility of the r <dig> domain and thereby significantly decreases specific myb-dna binding activity and trans-activation. the model of the vvmyb5b r2r <dig> domain illustrated in figure 1b shows that the r <dig> residue is, like its counterpart r <dig> in mmc-myb, involved in the formation of a salt bridge that may participate in the stabilization of the protein  <cit> . the impact of salt bridges formation in the activity of such transcription factor is poorly understood, but the few available studies suggest that they may influence both dna binding affinities and trans-activation properties of transcription factors. disruption of the salt bridge by amino acid substitution affected the crp  protein activity and led to a reduction of the lac promoter trans-activation, without affecting its dna binding affinity  <cit> . this reduction is attributed to an alteration of the interaction with the α-subunit of rna polymerase. in our study, r <dig> was substituted by a leucine residue, and we demonstrated that this single residue mutation in the third helix of the r <dig> repeat could modify the protein interaction properties of vvmyb5b together with its dna binding affinities.

the r69l substitution affects trans-activation properties of vvmyb5b
in yeast, we found that vvmyb5bl effector construct fused to yeast gal4-dbd was barely able to increase the expression of reporter genes. one can make the assumption that the amino acid substitution within r <dig> repeat in vvmyb5l may result in a weaker interaction between this protein and yeast general co-activators of the rna polii complex. indeed, transcription factors act in several ways through protein interactions to enhance the expression of a target gene. activators interact with chromatin remodelling factors, general transcription factors  of the rna polii pre-initiation complex, and can also affect initiation of the transcription and elongation  <cit> . the decrease of transactivation properties of vvmyb5b caused by the mutation, in yeast, can be explained by a decrease of its ability to recruit the yeast gtfs.

in eukaryotic transcription factors, dna-binding domains and activation/repression domains are thought to be spatially independent. the yeast two-hybrid technique is based on this concept  <cit> . based on our results , these two domains seem to be intimately dependent, as previously shown for some myb transcription factors. in the c-myb protein for instance, the c-terminal negative regulation domain can interact with the r2r <dig> n-terminal domain to alter its intrinsic properties  <cit> . likewise, in c <dig>  a myb transcription factor promoting anthocyanin accumulation in maize, the r2r <dig> domain seems to interact with the c-terminal region to keep the protein inactive in the absence of its bhlh partner  <cit> .

although vvmyb5b works in yeast as a strong transcriptional activator, it requires in grape cells, as does vvmyba, at least one bhlh partner to be fully functional . in this study, vvmyb5bl was not able to activate vvchi promoter in grape cells despite the co-expression of both bhlh and wdr. in addition, we show that, unlike vvmyb5br, vvmyb5bl did not interact with vvmyc <dig> in yeast  <cit> . taken together, these results suggest that the amino acid substitution clearly has an impact on the protein-protein interaction selectivity and subsequently on the trans-activation properties of the regulatory complex as well.

the r69l mutation modifies the in vivo selectivity of vvmyb5b for protein partners
overexpression experiments in tobacco suggest the presence of different regulatory mechanisms in stamens and corollas, with regard to flavonoid pathway genes expression. first, none or little expression was observed for the ntchs, ntans and ntdfr genes in stamens of control plants. this suggests the absence of an efficient regulatory complex in this tissue or the lack of at least one component of the system. however, in corollas of control plants, a baseline expression was detected for the same structural genes on the same control plants supporting the idea of a pre-existing transcriptional network regulating the accumulation of anthocyanins in these floral organs.

in 35s::vvmyb5br transgenic tobacco stamens, it appears that the presence of the native vvmyb5br protein and its interaction with endogenous pre-existing protein partner leads to the activation of the entire anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway . in corollas, the absence of ntdfr upregulation observed in 35s::vvmyb5br plants might be explained by the lack of interaction between vvmyb5br and a specific protein partner different from the one required for ntans and ntchs genes expression . another hypothesis may involve the presence of two distinct ntdfr genes in stamen and corolla, respectively. this alternative explanation cannot be totally ruled out but seems unlikely, taking into account the fact that the primers used in this study have been designed to amplify the two dfr genes identified to date in the tobacco genome.

in the 35s::vvmyb5bl plants, the clearly different behavior of vvmyb5bl in stamen and corolla cells regarding gene activation capabilities supports the hypothesis of the presence of various protein partners in these tissues. in addition, the induction of ntchs, ntans and ntdfr genes expression observed in corolla indicates that vvmyb5bl can efficiently bind dna in this tissue. thus, in stamens, vvmyb5bl might fail to interact with the endogenous co-partner, and thus not induce the expression of the ntchs, ntans and ntdfr genes . the situation is clearly different in corollas where the presence of vvmyb5bl leads to the induction of all genes studied, indicating that the mutated protein can interact with the array of endogenous co-partners needed for the activation of ntchs, ntans and ntdfr genes expression. in addition, the induction of ntdfr expression in corolla cells, which is not observed in the presence of vvmyb5br, indicates that the structural changes linked to the mutation have now allowed the interaction with the specific partner required for ntdfr gene expression . thus, taken together, these results indicate that the r69l substitution modifies the interaction capabilities of vvmyb5b with its putative protein partners, which subsequently impacts on the regulation of target genes expression.

in maize, amino acid substitutions within the dna binding domain of the myb transcription factor zmp <dig> also has a strong influence on the cooperative effect of zmp <dig> with its partners  <cit> . indeed, zmp <dig> does not require the interaction with the bhlh protein r to transactivate the dfr gene but fails to transactivate the bz <dig> gene encoding udp-glucose:flavonoid 3-o-glucosyltransferase  <cit> . mutation of zmp <dig> within the dbd facilitates zmp <dig> interaction with r, which in turn allows the binding of the complex to the promoter region of bz <dig> gene.

further investigations will be needed to ascertain the model presented in figure  <dig>  such as the identification of different bhlh or wdr partners in both tobacco corollas and stamens. co-expression of two different bhlh genes has already been demonstrated in petunia flowers, where an <dig> and jaf <dig> are preferentially expressed in corolla and stamens, respectively  <cit> ). likewise, in snapdragon flowers, the myb transcription factors rosea <dig>  rosea <dig> and venosa control anthocyanin biosynthesis by differentially interacting with the bhlh partners mut and delila in the different floral organs  <cit> . in the same way, the gerbera hybrida bhlh protein gmyc <dig> is thought to control the expression of the ghdfr gene in corolla and carpel tissues, whereas an alternate gmyc1-independent regulatory mechanism may exist in pappus and stamens  <cit> . these studies indicate that different bhlh transcription factors may be co-expressed in the different tissues of tobacco flowers. however, for this plant species, only one myb transcription regulating the flavonoid pathway factor has been characterized so far  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the amino acid substitution in position  <dig> was expected to have an impact on the dna-binding activity of vvmyb5bl, as previously described for the c-myb protein  <cit> . according to our results, neither native vvmyb5br nor mutated vvmyb5bl were able to bind mbs sequences in emsa experiments. however, vvmyb5br did activate the vvchi promoter when co-expressed with the co-factors ategl <dig>  and atttg <dig>  in grapevine cells , but was not able to bind the same sequence in yeast one-hybrid experiments. these results indicate that vvmyb5b needs its protein partner to bind dna and that emsa and yeast one-hybrid methods are not appropriate to investigate the ability of vvmyb5br/l to bind target sequences. finally, the upregulation of the ntchs, ntans and ntdfr genes observed in 35s::vvmyb5bl tobacco plants is consistent with the presence of a functional vvmyb5bl protein. thus, vvmyb5bl appears still able to recognize and bind dna, even though further investigations will be needed to ascertain the direct or indirect role of residue r <dig> in the dna binding properties of vvmyb5b.

in summary, this work describes the structural and biological consequences of a single amino acid change on both the dimerization and the dna binding properties of a grapevine myb transcription factor. these two functions appear related, as the conformation of the r2r <dig> domain, that regulates dna affinity and binding, can be modified after interactions with protein partners. as a consequence, the array of target genes of a given myb factor may vary depending on the protein partner involved.
