BACKGROUND
the potential benefits of marine pharmacology remain to be fully realised. diverse and novel natural products isolated from bacteria, algae and benthic invertebrates including soft corals, sponges and anemones from distinct marine environments have been chemically identified and some of their biological activities characterised  <cit> . marine organisms may contain many potential novel drugs because of the unique environmental conditions  found in their habitats. these conditions have led to the biosynthesis of unique compounds  <cit> . however, such studies are associated with clear difficulties that include the taxonomy of organisms, identification of the origins of bioactive materials, reproducibility of material collection and complex chemistry  <cit> .

the red sea has two major distinctive features. it has one highest levels of marine bio-diversity and it has great seasonal fluctuations of air and water temperatures. conducting research on red sea organisms offers unique advantages, in view of the diversity and high endemism of its biota. for example, of the  <dig> known species of the soft corals, about  <dig> % are unique to the red sea  <cit> .

several groups of marine organisms including soft-bodied sessile invertebrates, such as tunicates, soft corals, and certain sponges appear defenceless yet they have few predators and are not substrates for fouling micro-organisms. these organisms are rich in nutritionally important substances and use an arsenal of chemical defences and chemical repellents to protect themselves and when competing for space. the incidence of predation is low because of the production of toxic compounds and the possession of some form of calcareous sclerites  <cit> .

in this study we have used the electrophysiological properties of cultured sensory neurones from rat dorsal root ganglia  as an assay system to identify and characterize the biological activities on ion channel currents of crude extracts and an active purified common compound present in two soft coral samples. the activities of some soft coral toxins are consistent with pore-formation as a mechanism of action and the natural products responsible may be similar to polymeric alkylpyridinium salts from marine sponges  <cit> .

previously, a number of interesting biologically active compounds from soft corals have been studied and these genera are sources of hundreds of different compounds  <cit> . a few examples include:  <dig>  sarcophytolide  from sarcophyton glaucum, which, is antimicrobial and suppresses glutamate-evoked ca2+ responses and neurone death  <cit> .  <dig>  brominated oxylipins from dendronephthya spp and tubipora musica, which are toxic to shrimps, sea urchin eggs and crown gall tumors  <cit> .  <dig>  singardin a heptacyclic norcembranoid dimer, which shows cytotoxicity against murine leukemia, human melanoma cells, human lung and colon carcinomas  <cit> .  <dig>  lophotoxins from a variety of soft corals that are nicotinic acetylchoine receptors antagonists  <cit> .  <dig>  palytoxin, from the genus palythoa, which is highly poisonous and increases membrane permeability to cations and potently inhibits na+/k+ atpase  <cit> .  <dig>  a c- <dig> steroid from lobophytum crassum the biological activity of which is yet to be reported  <cit> . ethyl acetate extraction of a single species of soft coral  has yielded a number of distinct novel compounds   <cit> . the many diverse compounds are produced, some within nematocyst venoms that have hemolytic, dermonecrotic and vasopermeabilising factors  <cit> , others are confined to protective mucus  <cit> , eggs and larvae , or are released into the water column during mass spawning  <cit> .

although we have failed to find a pore forming compound, our research has identified a natural product that can dramatically increase the excitability of cultured sensory neurones and therefore may act as a pronociceptive agent against predators.

RESULTS
chemical characterization of the soft coral samples and identification of the active compound
the similarity of the 1h nmr spectra of crude extracts, especially in the region 7– <dig> ppm, from sarcophyton glaucum and lobophyton crassum provided the starting point for comparison of bioactivity. the specimens of sarcophyton glaucum and lobophyton crassum were not heavily armoured but were free from fouling organisms indicating that they had efficient chemical defenses. in contrast, sinularia leptoclados is heavily armoured but does not contain material with a similar 1h nmr spectrum as seen for the other two species. table  <dig> shows the nmr data for 3-carboxy-1-methyl pyridinium  obtained in cd3od. the low-resolution electron impact mass spectrometry  of 3-carboxy-1-methyl pyridinium showed a pseudomolecular ion + at m/z  <dig>  the high-resolution electron impact mass spectrometry  provided the exact value of m/z  <dig>   for +, which corresponded well with the formula c7h7no <dig>  the formula suggested five degrees of unsaturation. the 1h nmr spectrum of 3-carboxy-1-methyl pyridinium exhibited signals at δh  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>  , whose chemical shifts were reminiscent of those of some pyridine mesomeric betaine alkaloids e.g. pyridinebetaine a  <cit> , and homarine  <cit> . these values were assigned to h- <dig>  h- <dig>  h- <dig> and h- <dig> protons respectively and their connectivities to their respective carbons  were determined from a heteronuclear single quantum correlated spectroscopy  experiment. the 1h nmr spectrum also exhibited a proton singlet at δh  <dig>  , which showed heteronuclear multiple bond correlated spectroscopy  correlations with c- <dig>  and c- <dig> . this evidence indicated the presence of a methyl group on n- <dig> 

further database searches led to the identification of the structure as the long-known alkaloid, 3-carboxy-1-methyl pyridinium . confirmation of the structure was carried out by comparison of our nmr data with spectra from an authentic sample of 3-carboxy-1-methyl pyridinium  as well as with data from a previous study  <cit> .

actions of crude samples from soft corals on cultured drg neurone action potential properties
all the experiments conducted in this study were carried out in the continual presence of extracellular recording solution that contained  <dig> % dmso. this concentration of dmso was required to keep the crude extracts from red sea soft corals in solution. under these recording conditions the mean resting membrane potential and input resistance  were - <dig> ±  <dig> mv  and  <dig> ±  <dig> mΩ  respectively. these values are similar to the mean values , we have previously reported from studies carried out on cultured drg neurones in the absence of dmso  <cit> . drg neurones are a heterogeneous population of neurones, which show a variety of distinct structural, biochemical and electrophysiological characteristics. to standardize the electrophysiological recordings made from drg neurones the cells were held at a potential of - <dig> mv and depolarized with 100– <dig> ms current step commands to activate action potentials. most of our cultured drg neurones  show spike frequency adaptation  and fire only a single action potential in response to a prolonged supra-maximal depolarizing current command. in the absence of dmso we have reported multiple action potential firing in less than 20% of drg neurones  <cit> .

the recording method, animal species and culture conditions may influence multiple firing levels in sensory neurones and the incidence is higher in some other studies. for example previous work on whole nodose ganglia and ganglia slices showed that  <dig> % of c-fibre neurones and  <dig> % of a-fibre neurones show multiple firing properties  <cit> .

increasing the duration or amplitude of the stimulus does not increase the firing frequency in neurones that show spike frequency adaptation . however, some cultured drg neurones do not show spike frequency adaptation and fire increasing numbers of action potentials at higher frequencies as the amplitudes of current step commands are increased .

application of a crude sample from sarcophyton glaucum  for 3– <dig> minutes induced a dramatic increase in action potential firing. in six neurones that showed spike frequency adaptation, c.sg increased the number of action potentials evoked during  <dig> ms supra-maximal current commands from  <dig> action potential to a mean of  <dig> ±  <dig> . the number of action potentials was dependent on the amplitude and duration of the stimulus . similarly, application of a crude sample from lobophyton crassum  for 3– <dig> minutes also induced increases in action potential firing . in five neurones that showed spike frequency adaptation under control conditions, c.lobo increased the number of action potentials evoked during  <dig> ms supra-maximal current commands from  <dig> action potential to a mean of  <dig> ±  <dig> . furthermore, both c.sg and c.lobo samples reduced the amplitudes of the current stimuli required for the thresholds of action potential firing to be reached .

these responses developed gradually and in some cases continued to develop over  <dig> minutes after perfusion of the crude sample was stopped. however, recovery from these effects was seen after  <dig> minutes and reapplication of either of the crude soft coral extracts could produce repeatable responses. figure 4c illustrates some example records of action potential firing patterns evoked by + <dig> pa and + <dig> pa step commands, which show the features of the crude samples actions. these actions included an increased sensitivity to depolarizing current and a reversible lose of spike frequency adaptation. these effects were produced without any significant change in the resting membrane potential.

increasing the duration of the stimulus to  <dig> ms revealed further characteristics of the excitatory actions of the crude soft coral samples. figure 5a shows the diversity of the maximum levels of excitation achieved following three minutes application of  <dig> μg/ml c.lobo that continued to develop during  <dig> minutes recovery. in these cases 400– <dig> pa depolarizing currents activated between  <dig> and  <dig> action potentials in  <dig> ms. however, the features of the multiple firing induced by c.lobo were characterized by a gradual decline in action potential amplitude, a progressive failure in membrane potential repolarization and a gradual upward drift in the depolarizing electrotonic potential . in some cases, the drift in the depolarizing electrotonic potential was not dependent on action potentials but could also be seen to produce unusual irregular firing patterns where action potentials were observed only at the beginning and end of the stimulus. the striking effects on action potential firing of c.sg and c.lobo, which had similar 1h nmr spectra , were not seen when  <dig> μg/ml of crude sample from sinularia leptoclados  was applied to drg neurones. the same neurones that were unaffected by the sample from sinularia leptoclados were sensitive to repeated application of c.lobo . these data suggest that chemical entities common to both c.sg and c.lobo and possibly detected by nmr may be responsible for their actions on drg action potentials.

the multiple action potential firing patterns induced by c.sg and c.lobo were distinct from the control multiple firing observed in a small proportion of drg neurones. figure  <dig> shows example records of the actions of c.sg  on a drg neurone, which under control conditions showed multiple firing. three minutes application of c.sg did not attenuate action potential firing but resulted in a gradual decline in action potential amplitude, an increase in action potential duration and a progressive failure in complete action potential re-polarization.

the electrotonic responses to depolarizing current commands indicated that c.sg and c.lobo may influence rectification in drg neurones. this was investigated by generating current-voltage relationships in the presence and absence of  <dig> μg/ml c.sg  or  <dig> μg/ml c.lobo. three to five minutes application of c.sg  or c.lobo  had no significant effect on the mean electrotonic potential produced by - <dig> pa ). in contrast the mean depolarizing electrotonic potential produced by + <dig> pa step commands increased, an indication of a reduction in the rectification . under control conditions the mean electrotonic potential was  <dig> ±  <dig> mv and in the presence of c.sg or c.lobo the combined value increased to  <dig> ±  <dig> mv .

the changes in action potential firing properties induced by soft coral extracts could have resulted from modulation of voltage-activated na+ channels. to investigate this we studied the properties of single action potentials evoked by  <dig> ms depolarizing currents. action potential firing threshold and amplitude were not significantly altered by the soft coral extracts . under control conditions and in the presence of soft coral extracts the threshold for firing  and peak action potential amplitude  were unchanged. however, the mean action potential duration at 50% of peak amplitude was increased from  <dig> ±  <dig>  ms to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms  by the soft coral extracts.

given the effects of two crude extracts on action potential duration and firing we decided to investigate whether the increases in excitatory properties of drg neurones were accompanied by increases in intracellular ca2+ concentration evoked by depolarization.

actions of crude extracts from soft corals on intracellular calcium in drg neurones
the crude soft coral extracts also modulated increases in intracellular ca2+ evoked by kcl  stimulation. in particular, both c.sg and c.lobo increased kcl-evoked ca2+ transients and in a subpopulation of drg neurones the extracts reduced the threshold for activating a ca2+ transient . detailed analysis of the ca2+ transients evoked by kcl showed that total ca2+ flux was increased significantly  by  <dig> μg/ml c.sg . despite this, the nature of the enhancement in individual neurones varied such that there was no significant increase in the mean peak amplitude  or width of the response at 50% of peak amplitude . in some cases the peak ca2+ transient amplitudes were clearly increased by c.sg  but in other neurones the amplitudes were not increased but the durations of the responses were increased and in some instances appeared to show multiple peaks . the actions of c.sg on ca2+ transients appeared to be reversible . however, some caution is necessary in the interpretation of the results as the decline in the third response to kcl may result from ca2+-induced inactivation of voltage-activated ca2+ channels brought about by the increased intracellular ca2+ loads. figure 8f shows an example record from a drg neurone that did not respond to  <dig> mm kcl stimulation initially but subsequently responded to kcl when applied in the presence of c.sg. this phenomena occurred in  <dig> out of  <dig> drg neurones and interestingly these neurones responded to a third kcl pulse applied alone after priming with c.sg. this data is of particular concern as it suggests that stimulation with  <dig> mm kcl may not be sufficient to activate ca2+ transients in all cultured drg neurones. previously, we found that  <dig> mm kcl depolarizes drg neurones by  <dig> to  <dig> mv. stimulation with  <dig> mm kcl allows consistent ca2+ transients to be activated though it may bias analysis towards drg neurones with low thresholds for excitation.

the cultured drg neurones investigated in this study had a mean cell body area of  <dig> μm <dig> . responses to c.sg. were obtained from neurones with different sizes of cell body and different sensitivities to the natural product preparation did not appear to relate to size of cell body.

similar results were obtained with c.lobo . figure 8g shows a striking example of enhancement of a kcl-evoked ca2+ transient in the presence of c.lobo, but a more complete analysis of this sample was not possible because of the limited amount of material available.

actions of crude extracts from soft corals on voltage-activated potassium currents in drg neurones
the effects of the crude soft coral extracts suggested their action, at least part, involved the inhibition of voltage-activated k+ conductances. specifically, the soft coral samples from sarcophyton glaucum and lobophyton crassum prolonged action potentials, attenuated spike frequency adaptation, reduced rectification and enhanced kcl-evoked ca2+ transients, all of which could be associated with inhibition of k+ currents. drg neurones express diverse k+ channels and in small drg neurones five types have been identified . all these channels play roles in the control of action potential repolarisation and dr1– <dig> influence action potential firing threshold and after-hyperpolarisation and thus can influence firing patterns  <cit> . to investigate the actions of the soft coral extracts further, from a holding potential of - <dig> mv, outward currents were activated by  <dig> ms voltage step commands to potentials positive to - <dig> mv. three to five minutes application of  <dig> μg/ml c.sg significantly inhibited the voltage-activated k+ current at all voltages between - <dig> mv and + <dig> mv .

control currents were activated fully within  <dig> ms and were sustained during  <dig> ms depolarizations, but in the presence of c.sg the currents shape was changed. after  <dig> minute application of c.sg the outward currents were reduced and became transient in nature. partial recovery of the outward current was observed  <dig> minutes after removal of the perfusion pipette containing c.sg. additionally, partial recovery was also associated with a progressive slowing in the current decay during the voltage step command .

the actions of c.lobo on voltage-activated k+ currents followed a similar pattern to that seen with c.sg. application of  <dig> μg/ml c.lobo significantly inhibited the voltage-activated outward current and resulted in a decline in the current during the  <dig> ms voltage step command . c.lobo significantly reduced the outward current at all potentials between - <dig> mv and + <dig> mv. at a clamp potential of + <dig> mv, under control conditions the mean peak outward current was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  na and the mean current was significantly reduced to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  na  by c.lobo.

the crude extracts from soft corals did not significantly alter linear leak currents activated between - <dig> and - <dig> mv. at - <dig> mv the mean leak currents were - <dig>  ±  <dig>  na and - <dig>  ±  <dig>  na  under control conditions and in the presence of soft coral extract respectively.

the changes in shape of the voltage-activated k+ currents that were particularly apparent during the development of inhibition produced by both soft coral samples may be indicative of an open channel block mechanism of the active natural product common to both crude extracts.

to investigate the mechanism of inhibition we looked for any effect of the soft coral extracts on steady state inactivation and for evidence of use-dependence during the onset of inhibition by crude soft coral extracts . steady-state inactivation plots allowed the proportion of voltage-gated channels available to open at any given voltage to be determined. drug interactions with channels or differential effects of a drug to alter the population of active channels can shift steady-state inactivation plots. under voltage-clamp conditions neurones were held between - <dig> and - <dig> mv. from these holding potentials, neurones were stimulated with voltage step commands to + <dig> mv in the absence  and presence of  <dig> μg/ml c. sg . as can be seen from the raw current data  and the normalized plot  c. sg had no significant effects on k+ current steady-state inactivation. the mean voltages at which  <dig> % of the channels were available to open ) were - <dig> ±  <dig> mv in the control and - <dig> ±  <dig> mv  in the presence of c. sg.

preliminary results indicate that the delay between command steps has a critical effect on the size of the second response when two pulses are given in succession in the presence of c. sg. a series of experiments were conducted whereby the delays between pulses were varied . a  <dig> second delays between step commands resulted in recovery of the k+ current. in contrast a delay of  <dig> s resulted in further decline in the current . these data suggest there is a component of use-dependent inhibition but recovery can occur in 5– <dig> s. we conclude that the slowly developing main component of k+ current inhibition produced by the soft coral extracts involves another mechanism.

actions of purified active compound from sarcophyton glaucum
directed by chemical analysis and biological testing of crude extracts, the common active compound was identified as 3-carboxy-1-methyl pyridinium . this was purified from the crude extracts from sarcophyton glaucum  and tested using electrophysiological protocols described above. drg neurones were held at - <dig> mv and bathed in extracellular recording medium containing  <dig> % dmso. similar to the crude extracts the purified preparation p.sg  attenuated spike frequency adaptation and three minutes application of pure compound  resulted in multiple action potential firing in response to depolarizing current. this response was reversible but recovery was slow and as seen with the crude samples the effect of the natural product deepened after removal of the drug perfusion pipette . similarly, p.sg also attenuated the mean peak voltage-active k+ currents at + <dig> mv by 15% . however, these responses were modest and further inhibition could be obtained with c.sg . this was in part due to differences in concentrations tested and the small amounts of purified compound available. however, other components within the crude extract may enhance the activity of the major active component from sarcophyton glaucum.

an investigation of the possible roles of intracellular signalling in the bioactivity of crude extracts from sarcophyton glaucum
slow onset of the responses to the crude extracts from sarcophyton glaucum and lobophyton crassum, the continued development of their effects after it was no longer being applied, and the slow recovery phase all raised the possibility that modulation of neuronal excitability might involve the activation of intracellular signals rather than a direct interaction with k+ channels. to investigate this possibility, three approaches were taken to disrupt certain intracellular signalling which might modulate k+ channels. firstly, the cyclooxygenase  <dig> and  <dig> inhibitor indomethacine  was applied to the bath and to the intracellular environment via the patch pipette solution. the activities of cyclooxygenases have been implicated in modulating k+ conductances to increase neuronal excitability  <cit> . secondly, pertussis toxin sensitive g-proteins were inhibited by incubating the drg neurones for  <dig> hours with  <dig> ng/ml pertussis toxin. thirdly, the protein kinase c inhibitor chelerythrine  was applied to the intracellular environment via the patch pipette solution. at a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml, c.sg persisted in enhancing drg neurone excitability in the presence of indomethacine, after pertussis toxin pre-treatment and in the presence of chelerythrine. spike frequency adaptation was attenuated and multiple firing was observed under all three conditions . additionally, as previously observed in the absence of blockers c.sg inhibited voltage-activated k+ currents in the presence of indomethacin , after pertussis toxin treatment  and in the presence of chelerythrine . although not an exhaustive list of potential target sites, our data clearly indicates that the soft coral natural product does not enhance excitability through cyclooxygenases, activation of a pertussis toxin g-protein or via protein kinase c.

actions of 3-carboxy-1-methyl pyridinium on cultured drg neurones
the identification of 3-carboxyl-1-methyl pyridinium  as an active component in samples from sarcophyton glaucum and lobophyton crassum but not sinularia leptoclados resulted in testing a synthetic sample of this compound. in our initial studies, we applied cpm in the presence of  <dig> % dmso to keep the recording conditions the same as with the soft coral extracts. tests were also conducted in the absence of dmso and it was found that the presence or absence of dmso had no bearing on the results. although  <dig> μm cpm attenuated spike frequency adaptation and induced multiple firing , some features of the biological activity seen with the natural product samples were not seen with the synthetic compound. these included action potential prolongation and depolarizing drift in the electrotonic potential. this may be explained by the lower level of k+ current inhibition seen with  <dig> μm cpm compared with  <dig> μg/ml crude sample. in the presence and absence of  <dig> % dmso, cmp inhibited the k+ current at + <dig> mv by  <dig> ±  <dig> %  and  <dig> ±  <dig> % . these data suggest that dmso is not a factor in determining the actions of cpm. raising the concentration of cpm to  <dig> mm resulted in greater inhibition of the k+ current at + <dig> mv to  <dig> %. this compares with the level of inhibition of  <dig> % produced by  <dig> μg/ml of crude sample. from this we conclude that enhanced excitability of drg neurones was caused by cpm, which is a major component in the crude samples from sarcophyton glaucum and lobophyton crassum. we estimate that the soft coral extract contained ~7% cpm, which would give approximately  <dig> μm cpm in the test dose of  <dig> μg/ml. clearly there is an apparent anomaly between the time courses of the currents and amplitude of the responses observed when the actions of the soft coral samples and cpm from a synthetic source are compared. this discrepancy is not due to the presence of dmso and would appear to result from an additional as yet unidentified natural product or products present in the samples. these other substances may enhance delivery and/or action of cpm.

CONCLUSIONS
the crude samples from sarcophyton glaucum and lobophyton crassum but not sinularia leptoclados gave nmr spectra that had common peaks in the region 7– <dig> ppm. the presence of a common natural product in two species of soft coral but not a third may result from biosynthesis in soft coral tissues but could also be the result of metabolism in symbiotic organisms common to sarcophyton glaucum and lobophyton crassum. however, all three species studied have symbiotic zooxanthellae and the biosynthesis of cpm may reflect common ancestry. the optimum defense theory predicts that organisms with any sort of mechanical defense will not be vulnerable to predators and consequently lack chemical defenses. thus, we suggest that sinularia that is heavily encrusted and is highly packed with dense spicules does not produce cpm: while the fleshy flourishing lobophyton and sarcophyton samples produce defences that might include cpm for protection. phylum cnidaria, that include soft corals, may gain a level of defence from potential vertebrate predators by increasing excitability and producing abnormal firing patterns in sensory neurones. in certain hydrozoa, relatively low concentrations of trigonelline  antagonised larval metamorphosis induced by cs+ enriched seawater  <cit> . it is not clear if there is any relationship between the chemical control of development and chemical defence potentially provided  by the same compound.

pyridinium compounds represent a biosynthetic starting point for pore forming alkylpyridinium chemical defences found in marine sponges  <cit> . they may also provide interesting evolutionary links or offer evidence for common symbiotic relationships between distinct organisms that have different chemical defences based around pyridinium salts.

the alkaloid cpm is not a novel compound and has a fairly wide distribution in the plant and animal kingdoms. it has been identified in a number of higher plant species  <cit>  and in marine shellfish  <cit> . cpm acts as an osmoregulator in plants when they are exposed to excess salts, a function it may also have in some marine invertebrates. it also acts as a cell cycle regulator during the early growth of many legume root meristems  <cit> . in  <dig>  tohda and colleagues  <cit>  reported that cpm induced neurite outgrowth in human neuroblastoma cells, an activity that may be associated with electrophysiological changes and increased excitability.

potassium channels are a highly diverse group of channels and are targets for a wide range of natural toxins from both marine and terrestrial organisms. examples of toxins from marine invertebrates that inhibit voltage-activated k+ conductances include sea anemone peptides   <cit> , the coneshell toxin κ-conotoxin pviia  <cit>  and latrunculin a from sponges and nudibranchs  <cit> . we have not assessed the selectivity of cpm for voltage-activated k+ channel sub-types in drg neurones for two reasons. firstly, unlike many of the peptide toxins, cpm is not very potent. secondly, drg neurones are a heterogeneous population of neurones that express at least six different types of k+ channels in distinct manners  <cit>  and therefore would not provide a suitable assay preparation. application of cpm increases electrophysiological excitability of drg neurones. we predict from our study that it is a major component of the soft coral extracts that is responsible for changes in current kinetics and the inhibition of delayed rectifier k+ channels. additionally, cpm increases kcl-evoked ca2+ flux an action consistent with an increase in action potential firing. however, the intracellular ca2+ signals in part result from ca2+-induced ca2+ release from intracellular stores and ca2+ release channels may also be modulated by cpm. furthermore, altering the patterns of action potential firing in sensory neurones may provide mechanisms for chemical defence. the actions of the natural products and cpm was not restricted to a subpopulation of small diameter  neurones so a variety of sensory neurones may be effected.
