BACKGROUND
francisella tularensis is an facultative intracellular pathogen that causes tularemia in humans and a wide range of animals  <cit> . strains of f. tularensis subsp.  tularensis can be lethal to humans and are mostly associated with cases of tularemia in the u.s.a. doses as low as 10– <dig> bacteria can be infective  <cit> . transmission mostly occurs via aerosol, alimentary ingestion or skin inoculation. in addition, f. tularensis is suspected as a potential bacterial biological weapon  <cit> . the species ft. novicida is almost avirulent for humans in contrast to mice, and is thought to be an opportunistic pathogen  <cit> . ft. novicida is assumed to constitute an environmental lineage along with f. philomiragia. in rare cases the latter has also been associated with human disease in immunocompromised individuals  <cit> .

human infections caused by f. tularensis are rare in germany, but seroprevalence studies in wild animals revealed a high seroprevalence of f. tularensis in wildlife in eastern germany  <cit> . in germany, ft. holarctica is generally identified in affected animals or humans as well as in known vectors   <cit> . other as yet known species of the genus francisella are f. hispaniensis <cit> , f. halioticida <cit> , f. piscida <cit> , f. noatunensis <cit> , f. asiatica <cit> , f. noatunensis subsp. orientalis <cit>  and f. philomiragia subsp. noatunensis <cit> . very recently, a new francisella species  was isolated from a cooling tower in china, which had not been reported before  <cit> .

however, to our knowledge, no species other than ft. holarctica has been identified in germany until now. therefore, our new isolate w12- <dig> is the first aquatic isolate identified in germany which does not belong to the species f. tularensis and is closest related to f. guangzhouensis.

methods
strains, media and growth conditions
strains used in this study were ft subsp. holarctica lvs , ft. novicida u <dig> , f. philomiragia , legionella pneumophila paris  and the new environmental francisella isolate w12- <dig>  francisella strains were cultivated in medium t  <cit>   or on enriched cystine-heart agar . w12- <dig> and l. pneumophila paris were cultivated in aces-buffered yeast extract  broth , on aces-buffered charcoal–yeast extract  agar  <cit>  or on gvpc agar plates . isolate w12- <dig> was initially cultivated on gvpc agar plates. the u <dig> human macrophage-like cell line atcc crl- <dig>  and the mouse macrophage cell line j774a. <dig> were cultivated in rpmi 1640 + 10% fcs medium  at 37°c and 5% co <dig> 

phenotypic assays
growth without additional cysteine was done on bcye agar plates without additional cysteine. physiological characteristics of analyzed strains were determined by using api zym .

chitinase activity tests were done on  <dig> % agarose plates containing  <dig> % deacetylated glycol chitin. chitinase activity experiments were done as described earlier  <cit> , with the modification that the deacetylated glycol chitin was suspended in  <dig>  m sodium phosphate  by heating. in short, bacteria were grown in medium t overnight. the supernatant was precipitated by isopropanol and the protein pellet was resuspended in pbs . 50 μl were inoculated into agar plates  and incubated for two days at 37°c. degrading activity was visualized by incubation with  <dig> % calcofluor brightener  <dig>  for 10 min, washing two times with water and then incubation at room temperature  overnight.

the nacl sensitivity assays were done in 96-well plates in a total volume of 200 μl of medium t and ~2 ×  <dig> bacterial cells. plates were incubated 2– <dig> days at 37°c and 5% co <dig>  and then the optical density  at 600 nm was measured using an infinite  <dig> reader .

intracellular multiplication of francisella in host cells
to determine which amoeba strain may be suitable to be used for replication assays, isolate w12- <dig>  was suspended in 1 ml of dh2o and 100 μl were plated onto nn-agar plates . the amoeba strain  was dropped onto the centre of the plates and incubated at rt or at 30°c for 7 days. the plates were inspected daily for movement and replication of the amoeba. all amoeba tested were motile and not killed by isolate w12- <dig>  therefore, no further experiments were performed using amoebae as host cells.

for differentiation into macrophage-like cells, u <dig> cells were adjusted to 3 ×  <dig> cells/ml and transferred into 100 ml of fresh rpmi medium containing 10% fetal calf serum , and pma  was added at a concentration of 1: <dig> . after incubation for 36 h at 37°c and 5% co <dig>  the supernatant was discarded and adherent cells were washed once with 10 ml of  <dig> % edta in pbs. cells were mechanically detached from the flask bottom with rpmi + 10% fcs, transferred into 50 ml tubes and centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min. all cells were counted after trypan blue staining in a neubauer counting chamber and adjusted to 5 ×  <dig> cells/ml with rpmi + 10% fcs. to each well of a 24-well plate 1 ml of the cell suspension was added and incubated for adhesion during 2 h at 37°c and 5% co <dig>  macrophage-like mouse cell line j774a. <dig> was also grown in fresh rpmi medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and treated as described above, but without the differentiation step .

for both cell lines, stationary phase bacteria grown for 3 days on cha or bcye agar were diluted in plain rpmi medium and the infection was done with a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  for 2 h at 37°c and 5% co <dig>  cells were washed three times with rpmi and incubated with 50 μg/ml of gentamycin for 1 h to kill extracellular bacteria. cells were washed again three times with rpmi and covered with 1 ml of rpmi + 10% fcs. for colony-forming unit  determination at various time points of infection, coincubations of cells and bacteria were lysed by addition of 10 μl of 10% saponin  for 5 min, and serial dilutions were plated on bcye agar. in a control experiment we showed that saponin treatment did not affect the number of remaining cfu of strain w12- <dig> .

electron microscopy 
j774a. <dig> cells were infected with francisella strain w12- <dig>  at 37°c as described above. cells were fixed 96 h post infection with  <dig> % glutaraldehyde in  <dig>  m hepes buffer. bacteria cultivated in medium t were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde 5% glutaraldehyde in  <dig>  m hepes buffer for 2 h at rt. all samples were post-fixed with osmium tetroxide  and uranyl acetate , dehydrated stepwise in a graded ethanol series and embedded in lr white resin  which was polymerized at 60°c overnight. thin sections were prepared with an ultramicrotome  and counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.

samples were examined using a transmission electron microscope  at 80 kv, and the images were recorded using a slow-scan charge-coupled-device camera .

genome sequencing, orf finding and annotation
genome sequencing of chromosomal dna of isolate w12- <dig> was performed by eurofins mwg operon :  short insert shotgun library : 1 μg of dna was fragmented using a covaris e <dig> instrument  according to manufacturer’s instructions. end-repair, da-tailing and ligation of barcoded adapter were performed following new england biolabs’ instructions . emulsion-based clonal amplification  was performed following roche’s instructions . flx + sequencing: sequencing was performed on an flx + platform according the manufacturer’s instructions using 1/ <dig> plate. the sequencing process was controlled by the roche  <dig> software gsrunprocessor v <dig>  .  8 kb mate-pair-like library : creation of the 8 kb mate-pair-like library was done at eurofins mwg operon  using their proprietary protocol.  illumina sequencing: for sequencing, the library was loaded on an illumina miseq machine. cluster generation and paired-end sequencing was performed using the manufacturer’s instructions. miseq control software  <dig> . <dig> was used for sequencing. for processing of raw data rta version  <dig> . <dig> and casava  <dig> . <dig> were used to generate fastq-files.  data analysis: a two-step hybrid de novo assembly was conducted using the sequencing data of the two libraries. first, the flx + data  has been assembled separately using the roche  <dig> software newbler . the resulting contigs as well as the illumina long-jumping-distance pairs  were then assembled together with a hardware-accelerated assembly pipeline based on the convey hardware and software tools  that mimic a standard de novo assembly using the velvet assembler   <cit> . the draft genome  was annotated by using the rast server, freely available at http://www.patricbrc.org <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis
16s rdna gene and the multi-gene locus  of genes fopa, gyra, rpoa, groel, sdha and dnak of strain w12- <dig> and available homologous sequences from francisella species and l. pneumophila paris  were used for nucleotide comparison. the multi-gene locus of l. pneumophila paris exhibited no fopa gene because no homolog is present within the genome. phylogenetic analysis  was generated by using the clustalw program .

RESULTS
during  <dig> health authorities of the city of heilbronn  observed some coincident spots of legionnaires’ disease . therefore, different putative sources were screened for the presence of legionella species using gvpc  agar plates. the investigation of a water reservoir of a cooling tower led to the isolation of strain w12- <dig>  the isolate w12- <dig> was first thought to belong to the genus legionella because of its habitus and growth on gvpc agar plates, but pcr analysis did not support this finding. preliminary 16s rdna pcr analysis performed by the german consultant laboratory for legionella  revealed that this strain may belong to the genus francisella. the identified isolate was not involved in the ld outbreak. however, the strain was send for further analysis to the centre for biological threats and special pathogens at the robert koch institute . here, w12- <dig> was identified to be the first german isolate of the genus francisella which did not belong to the species f. tularensis.

analysis of strain w12-1067
first we performed 16s rdna pcr and sequenced the pcr product. the phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rdna revealed that isolate w12- <dig> is a close representative of the recently identified new environmental francisella species f. guangzhouensis <cit> . the phylogenetic tree of 16s rdna of different francisella strains is given in figure 1a, corroborating the close relationship of isolate w12- <dig> with f. guangzhouensis and other chinese cooling tower isolates of this species . the other francisella strains analyzed revealed dna identities of 16s rdna sequences of 94–95% with 16s rdna of isolate w12- <dig> and 83% identity with the 16s rrna gene of l. pneumophila paris.

we then sequenced the whole genome of w12- <dig>  resulting in an annotated draft genome of this strain. we used the sequences of the genes fopa, gyra, rpoa, groel, sdha and dnak  to build a multi-gene locus  for each strain analyzed. with these 6-loci concatenated sequences we performed a further phylogenetic analysis . the overall dna identity was only 89%, indicating that w12- <dig> is not identical to strain f. guangzhouensis, but that f. guangzhouensis is the closest relative identified to date. the overall dna identity of the gene cluster of isolate w12- <dig> to other francisella strains analyzed was 80–81% and that to l. pneumophila paris 67% .

type strain of f. guangzhouensis sp. nov .

similar to strain w12- <dig>  f. guangzhouensis strains had been isolated from water of air conditioning systems of cooling towers in china, during a routine investigation to detect legionella <cit> . the growth optimum of this species ranged between  <dig> and 28°c and it showed growth on bcye-alpha  legionella-agar plates. furthermore, no virulence to mice was found for this strain  <cit> . no further information about virulence properties of this species was available yet.

we investigated the growth of strain w12- <dig> on different agar plates and within different liquid media. francisella sp. strain w12- <dig> grew well on bcye, gvpc and cha plates. the isolate grew faster in medium t than in aye medium, and it did not grow in the cell culture medium rpmi . whereas l-cysteine within bcye agar plates is necessary for the growth of l. pneumophila paris, it stimulates the growth of f. philomiragia, and the growth of strain w12- <dig> was nearly similar with or without additional cysteine . growth in medium t revealed that the growth optimum of strain w12- <dig> is about 30°c , but growth of strains f. philomiragia and ft. novicida in general was faster and reached a higher cell density compared to that of the growth of strain w12- <dig> . growth of strain w12- <dig> in media with nacl was reduced from a concentration of 4–5% nacl, which was comparable to growth of strains f. philomiragia and ft. novicida , but more resistant than the non-halotolerant strain ft. holarctica lvs . using the api zym assay kit , w12- <dig> showed a profile similar to f. guangzhouensis . in contrast to f. guangzhouensis, isolate w12- <dig> was negative for alkaline phosphatase activity and showed only very low activity of the acid phosphatase, which is in good agreement with only one putative phosphatase encoding gene  present within the genome sequence .

these experiments were followed by co-culture studies using macrophage-like cell lines of human  or mice  origin as host cells. we found that strain w12- <dig> was able to persist within u <dig> cells , and it replicated intracellularly in j774a. <dig> cells . replication within j774a. <dig> was slower than that of l. pneumophila paris. however, w12- <dig> multiplied about 16-fold within 4 days of co-incubation, with a 24 h lag-phase at the beginning of the infection , indicating that the new isolate is able to infect and multiply within eukaryotic cells. cells of strain w12- <dig> grown in medium t at 37°c possessed a rod-shaped, slightly pleomorphic morphology . em analysis of the infection assay revealed that strain w12- <dig> was localized intracellularly within a vacuole 96 h after infection . the data indicate that w12- <dig> is able to replicate intracellularly, but from em analysis it was not clear yet whether the bacteria were able to escape from the vacuole. experiments are under way to investigate this question further.

whole genome sequencing and sequence analysis of strain w12-1067
general features
the genomic dna was sequenced using  <dig> shotgun reads and paired-end illumina reads , followed by de novo assembly of the sequence, which was done by eurofins , resulting in  <dig> contigs and a chromosomal size of approximately  <dig> ,745 bp. the draft genome was annotated by using the rast server . all genes encoded by the draft genome sequence of isolate w12- <dig>  are given in the additional file 2: table s <dig>  the draft genome exhibits  <dig>  protein-coding genes , three copies of the 16s-23s-5s rrna gene locus  and  <dig> trna genes . the g + c content is  <dig> % and therefore not significantly different from various other francisella strains already sequenced  <cit> . however, the number of protein-coding genes and of trna genes seemed to be lower compared with other francisella strains , but this is not surprising since the w12- <dig> genome is of draft quality and the others are finished. the genes encoding the trnas are present in four , three  and two  copies. like in other francisella genomes, w12- <dig> genome exhibits only one copy of the other trna genes . the trna genes for ala and ile are only present within the ribosomal rna locus, which is also true for the other francisella strains and for most other bacteria  <cit> . genome sequence comparison using the mauve program  demonstrated that the genome of strain w12- <dig> is poorly similar to the genomes of ft. holarctica, ft. novicida, f. philomiragia or f. hispaniensis as02- <dig> , indicating the evolutionary distance between these strains . the mauve alignment of the draft genome sequence of strain w12- <dig> with the genome sequence of ft. novicida u <dig> is shown in the additional file 3: figure s <dig>  the genome sequence of strain f. guangzhouensis 08hl01032t was not yet available for a comparative analysis, but a g + c content of about  <dig> % of its draft genome was reported  <cit> .

mobile elements
in f. tularensis strains six different insertion sequences  elements  have been described. is elements are important elements of f. tularensis genomes and are thought to be generally stable among different isolates  <cit> . within the genome of francisella isolate w12- <dig>  we identified several mobile elements and transposases . for the element isfw <dig>  we identified  <dig> copies within the genome sequence. the element encodes a putative integrase of  <dig> amino acids with 70% amino acid identity to the protein encoded by the is <dig> element of wolbachia endosymbiont of drosophila simulans. all other elements are only present as a single copy. there is only one element  with significant similarity to one of the isftu elements of f. tularensis. isfw <dig> encodes a putative transposase exhibiting 78% amino acid identity to isftu <dig> of ft. holarctica strains. of the  <dig> mobile elements identified, six  exhibit homologs within francisella strains .

virulence factors and secretion systems
a number of genes involved in francisella pathogenesis have been identified in various different studies, including in vivo negative selection screens of transposon mutant libraries of francisella strains  <cit> , reviewed in  <cit>  and  <cit> . we therefore looked for homologs of these virulence genes within the genome sequence of francisella strain w12- <dig>  some of them are shown in table  <dig>  and others, like lps, capsule, type iv pili or fpi-associated genes, are described below. various known virulence factors of francisella exhibit homologs in strain w12- <dig>  for the most important virulence factors of f. tularensis, encoded by the genes of the francisella pathogenicity island , no close homologs could be identified within the genome. however, we identified an fpi-like island at the genome sequence which will be discussed later.

interestingly, the genome of isolate w12- <dig> exhibit six different chitinases of different sizes and putative location  , which was in good agreement with the phenotypically identified chitinase activity within the supernatant of francisella w12- <dig> cells . four chitinases  exhibit a signal peptide and therefore could be secreted by the general secretion system . two of the chitinases  are separated by a gene encoding a putative dna-invertase . we could not identify a homolog of this protein in the available genome sequences of francisella strains. we were unable to determine whether the invertase is involved in dna inversion in francisella and whether this may influence the expression of the nearby chitinase genes. chitinase peg_ <dig> is 76% identical to chitinase peg_ <dig>  both chitinases exhibit a homolog in f. philomiragia  <dig>  and  <dig>  but not in the other francisella strains, whereas homologs of the chitinases  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> could be found in the genomes of ft. tularensis, f. holarctica and f. philomiragia.

chitinases  have been detected as essential virulence factors of ft. novicida and for biofilm formation  <cit> . in l. pneumophila a chitinase was also found to be involved in the infectivity of legionella for mice  <cit> . it would be interesting to further analyze the role of the different chitinases in strain francisella w12- <dig> 

furthermore, we identified three hypothetical proteins  containing ankyrin-repeat domains. these proteins did not exhibit significant homology to any known protein . for l. pneumophila it was shown that ankyrin-repeat-containing proteins are involved in the pathogen–host interplay during intracellular replication  <cit> .

furthermore, we looked for genes encoding putative antibiotic resistance proteins. we identified ten putative multidrug resistance proteins . in addition, we identified a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase , a chloramphenicol phosphotransferase  and a streptomycin- <dig> kinase  without a homolog in any of the available francisella genomes. we performed growth inhibition experiments with the isolate w12- <dig> and found that levels of resistance to erythromycin, chloramphenicol and streptomycin were comparable to those of f. philomiragia . we also identified a putative acriflavin resistance protein  exhibiting 85% amino acid identity to the acrb protein  of f. philomiragia  <dig> 

since we identified putative signal peptides at the n-terminus of some of the chitinases and chitinase activity within the supernatant, we searched the genome sequence for genes of the general sec system. the identified proteins are given in the additional file 4: table s <dig>  we identified all proteins necessary for a putative functional sec system plus two signal sequence recognition proteins  and three different signal peptidases. therefore, strain w12- <dig> seems to encode a functional sec system for the transport of proteins across the inner membrane. we could not detect genes encoding homologs of a type-ii secretion system , but proteins  of a putative t1ss . we were also able to identify a putative functional tol-pal system generally involved in vitamin b <dig> or colicin translocation, but also in capsule synthesis and outer membrane vesicle formation  <cit> . the presence of a putative t6-like ss will be discussed in the next section.

a new putative homolog of the francisella pathogenicity island  and regulatory proteins
t6ss are widely distributed amongst diverse gram-negative species. it is a complex molecular machine which injects effector proteins to target cells or bacteria  <cit> . t6ss are involved in virulence and in eukaryotic cell targeting. they are also reported to have antibacterial activity  <cit> . most systems are able to function “anti-eukaryotically” or “anti-bacterially”, and one system has been reported to be able to do both  <cit> . it was also proposed that t6ss may target and defend predatory eukaryotes in the environment  <cit> . for an overview see  <cit> .

francisella strains exhibit an fpi encoding a functional t6ss, needed for preventing phagolysosomal fusion and escape into the cytosol, which is therefore essential for intracellular replication and pathogenicity of francisella <cit> . the island is ~33 kb in length, encodes for 15– <dig> open reading frames  and is present in ft. tularensis strains, ft. novicida and f. philomiragia . in strains of f. tularensis this island is duplicated  <cit> . however, it is still unclear yet whether both copies are needed for full virulence of these strains. genes of the locus were named igl  and pdp . the complete locus was identified in  <dig>  and it seems to be acquired via horizontal gene transfer because of a lower g + c content compared with the core genome  <cit> .

we were not able to identify a close homolog of the fpi within the genome of strain w12- <dig>  however, we identified two fpi-like clusters which seem to encode a further putative t6ss . clusters i  and ii  each code for  <dig> orfs. homologs of iglabc, dotu and pdbb are present, and the whole island i is similar to an fpi-like element  recently identified within the genome of ft. novicida, but not yet discussed further  <cit> . within the genome sequence, island i is also localized between the pyrd and tyra genes and island ii between rpsu and glms . all genes, features of the orfs and closest homologs of both systems identified within the genome of w12- <dig> are given in table  <dig>  in a recently published model of an fpi-encoded t6ss-like apparatus iglab , iglc , dotu , pdpb  and vgrg  were identified as core proteins of the t6ss  <cit> . we identified similar proteins within the identified loci of strain w12- <dig>  in strain f-tx <dig>  the fpi-like gene cluster is localized at a different site within its genome sequence . altogether these findings led us to hypothesize that these loci may encode a further t6-like ss in francisella strain w12- <dig>  as mentioned above, infection assays and em analysis indicateed that strain w12- <dig> is able to replicate intracellularly , which also suggest that there should be a functional t6ss in this strain. however, since the em analysis did not yet clearly demonstrate whether the strain is released into the cytosol, further experimental data are needed to verify this hypothesis.

various regulatory proteins are known for francisella, and the regulators mglab, sspa, pmra, fevr, migr and hfq were identified to be involved in the regulation of genes of the fpi  <cit> . in f. tularensis the genes of the fpi are upregulated during intracellular growth within macrophages  <cit> . in the genome of strain w12- <dig> we identified only homologs of mglab and hfq, but also two further response regulator proteins  as well as two sigma factors  and homologs of iscr, arsr, crp and fur . in addition, proteins involved in the stringent response could be identified .

surface structures: the wbt locus, capsule and type iv pili
 lps. the lipid a core portion of the lps anchors the lipopolysaccharide structure to the outer membrane, whereas the o-polysaccharide chain is the predominant epitope recognized by the immune system and specifies antigenicity. ft. tularensis subspecies-specific antisera have been generated and applied to antigen detection in f. tularensis <cit> . furthermore, lps is used as an antigen in seroprevalence studies and for diagnostic of human tularemia  <cit> . however, the lps produced by f. tularensis is less endotoxic compared to other gram-negative bacteria, such as e. coli, a phenotype also known for l. pneumophila lps  <cit> . genes probably involved in the biosynthesis of the o-polysaccharide chain are given in supplementary table  <dig> . obviously, there is one cluster of genes  for which homologs were found in ft. novicida and f. philomiragia, whereas for genes peg_0609- <dig> and peg_0628- <dig> the homologs were only found in f. philomiragia or ft. novicida u <dig>  respectively. in addition, there is another cluster of genes  which seems to have no homologs in f. tularensis or f. philomiragia, but homologs were identified in different bacterial species, as in vibrio, pseudomonas, sulfurovum or acinetobacter . the lps structure of strain w12- <dig> has not yet been analyzed further.

 capsule. electron microscopy of strain w12- <dig> grown on agar plates or in medium revealed the absence of a capsule . however, we identified three orfs encoding homologs of capbca genes . the capbca locus of francisella is similar to determinants encoding the poly-gamma-glutamic capsule in bacillus anthracis <cit> . these genes have been shown to be essential for the virulence of f. tularensis in a murine model of tularemia  <cit> . further experiments will be needed to analyze the role and structure of the capsule of francisella strain w12- <dig> and to identify conditions necessary for the putative induction of capsule gene expression.

 type iv pili. electron microscopy of strain w12- <dig> did not show any pili on the surface of the bacteria grown in medium at 37°c  or on agar plates . however, we identified homologs of the type iv pilus  encoding loci of f. philomiragia atcc  <dig> in the genome sequence of w12- <dig>   <cit> . we could not identify a pila homolog, a homolog of the second pilw protein fphi_ <dig> and of the two additional pila/pile pilus assembly proteins . tfp systems are known to be involved in bacterial pathogenesis, bacterial adhesion and twitching motility  <cit> . in l. pneumophila tfp pili are required for twitching motility, natural competence, biofilm formation and are involved in the attachment to host cells  <cit> . tfp have been observed on the surface of ft. novicida and ft. holarctica <cit> , and tfp are involved in the pathogenicity of francisella <cit> .

toxin–antitoxin systems
we identified three different type ii toxin–antitoxin systems . in type ii systems, the antitoxin  sequesters the toxin  through protein complex formation . peg_ <dig> encodes a protein , exhibiting a pfam_plasmid_txe domain and 67% amino acid identity to the yoeb toxin of pleurocapsa sp. pcc <dig>  peg_ <dig> encodes the respective putative antitoxin , exhibiting a pfam_phdyefm  and shows 60% amino acid identity to the prevent-host-death protein of methylocystis rosea. the second system is composed of protein peg_ <dig> , exhibiting a hth-xre motif and a higa-antidote  domain and shows 65% amino acid identity to protein llo_ <dig> of legionella longbeachae nsw <dig>  the respective putative toxin  is encoded by peg_ <dig>  exhibiting a pfam_plasmid killer domain, and shows 62% amino acid identity to the plasmid maintenance system killer protein of deferribacter desulfurricans ssm <dig>  both described systems seemed to have no homolog in the sequences of francisella available so far and are localized on contig_ <dig> of the draft genome of strain w12- <dig> 

the third system is localized on contig_ <dig>  peg_ <dig> encodes for a protein , exhibiting a pfam_phdyefm domain , and shows 66% amino acid identity to the plasmid-encoded  protein f243_ <dig> of f. philomiragia atcc  <dig> and 65% identity to the phd protein  of ft. novicida. the respective putative toxin  is encoded by peg_ <dig>  exhibits a pfam_plasmid_txe  domain and shows 79% amino acid identity to f243_ <dig> of f. philomiragia. plasmid pf <dig> is  <dig>  bp long and was predicted to encode six putative orfs  <cit> . orfs f243_ <dig> and f243_ <dig> are organized in an operon that is similar to the phd-doc post-segregation killing system operon of pfnl <dig>  <cit> . this post-segregation killing mechanism relies on the difference in stability of the antitoxin and toxin. in the daughter cells the plasmid-free bacteria will be killed by the activity of the toxin  <cit> . chromosomally encoded toxin–antitoxin systems may stabilize chromosomal regions during evolution and seem to be involved in host regulatory networks or fitness advantages  <cit> . less is known so far about toxin–antitoxin systems in francisella, but they have been used to construct plasmids which are stable without a selective marker gene  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the isolation of strain w12- <dig> in germany indicates for the first time the presence of a close homolog in europe of the new species f. guangzhouensis recently identified in china. in addition, to our knowledge this is the first report of a francisella species other than f. tularensis isolated in germany. further research is needed to analyze the spectrum of francisella species present in natural habitats in germany.

the growth optimum of the isolate is approximately 30°c, it is able to grow without additional cysteine within the medium and the strain is halotolerant. the analysis of the genome sequence of the new isolate revealed a lot of known francisella virulence factors, but also the absence of fpi, the major virulence factor of francisella strains. instead, the isolate seems to exhibit a putative new t6ss, and w12- <dig> is able to replicate within eukaryotic host cells. therefore, the isolate seems to be an interesting species to be analyzed further.
