BACKGROUND
the crown-of-thorns starfish, acanthaster planci , is a typical reef coral predator, which sometimes causes population outbreaks and destroys coral reef communities. the activities of this starfish have been responsible for causing extensive coral mortality in a large number of coral reef systems throughout the indo-pacific region  <cit> . major outbreaks involve large numbers of starfish and widespread coral destruction and consequently they can change the fauna and topographic nature of coral reef communities  <cit> .

in australia, kenchington  <cit>  hypothesized that outbreaks  started and in turn initiated a cascade of additional outbreaks . similarly, the great barrier reef  in australia and the ryukyu islands in japan have experienced two distinct series of outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish  <cit> . once the unpredictable primary outbreak occurs, this large population of adult a. planci that reproduces enormous amounts of eggs can lead to secondary outbreaks.

the high fecundity and long pelagic larval stage  <cit>  of a. planci imply that the dispersal and recruitment of larvae play an important role in the occurrence of primary and secondary outbreaks  <cit> . the lack of knowledge of its larval dispersal has limited the understanding of its population dynamics. some hydrodynamic models have been developed to describe larval dispersal around the gbr  <cit> . these authors suggested that larval dispersal was not random and provided probabilistic routes for dispersal through the gbr. they also claimed that some larvae might be retained on the natal reef. verifying the larval dispersal route predicted by these hydrodynamic models is essential. however, there are two difficulties in the study of larval dispersal and recruitment of a. planci from a biological perspective: 1) the morphological appearance of a. planci larvae is so similar to those of other asteroid species  <cit> , hence, it is extremely difficult to differentiated a. planci larvae from other asteroid larvae. recent concern about pelagic larvae dispersal emphasizes the need for accurate larval identification. 2) there have been no useful tools to reveal the reef-connectivity among reefs and autochthonous recruitment of a. planci larvae. therefore, the development of highly polymorphic genetic markers such as mitochondrial sequences or nucleic microsatellites has been eagerly desired. to resolve the former problem, evans  <cit>  developed a polymerase chain reaction -based identification tool for other asteroid species larvae  and showed the pcr-rflp assay is a useful tool for larval identification of asteroid larvae. the complete or partial mtdna sequences of many metazoans are now available  <cit> . having a relatively rapid evolutionary rate and lacking intermolecular genetic recombination, these data on mtdna sequences have been utilized to identify invertebrate larvae  <cit>  or conduct the population genetic study at various taxonomic levels  <cit> . the genetic information can be applied to overcome both these difficulties in the study of larval dispersal of a. planci.

in this study, we determined the complete sequences of the mitochondrial genome of a. planci and its sibling species, acanthaster brevispinus and compared in detail the full sequences of both species and a third asteroid species, asterina pectinifera. also, we describe some characteristics of both mitochondrial genomes of a. planci and a. brevispinus.

RESULTS
general features
the complete mtdna sequences of a. planci and a. brevispinus are  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp in size, respectively; both fit within the length variation range reported for other metazoan mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . they were submitted to the ddbj with accession no. ab <dig>  and ab <dig> . they contain  <dig> proteins,  <dig> rrna, and  <dig> trna genes  in the same order as another asteroid species, asterina pectinifera  <cit>  . both in a. planci and a. brevispinus, the l strand encodes most of the proteins including  <dig> proteins,  <dig> trna and 12s rrna genes, whereas the h strand includes the remaining three proteins ,  <dig> trna and 16s rrna genes  <cit> .

base composition and codon usage
animal mitochondrial genomes sometimes deviate from a random nucleotide usage, which may be due to the directional mutation pressure and the non-asymmetrical base composition of both the strands  <cit> . the a + t contents of a. planci and a. brevispinus on the l strand are  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, and both are lower than that of a. pectinifera . this result comes from the fact that the third codon position of the protein-coding gene in a. pectinifera prefers t more than those of a. planci and a. brevispinus, particularly in the synonymous codons of phe , leu , ile , ser  and asn  . the mtdna sequences of a. planci and a. brevispinus have a-bias on the first and second codon positions of protein-coding gene and rrna genes. there is no significant difference in the base composition of trna genes between the acanthaster species and a. pectinifera .

asakawa et al.  <cit>  demonstrated the bias of a strand-specific nucleotide composition in the mtdna of a. pectinifera that the l strand prefers to use a or c while the h strand prefers to use g or t in the third codons. this asymmetric distribution of g and c between the two complementary dna strands can be easily measured with the following formulae  <cit> ; gc-skew = /; at-skew = / where c, g, a and t are the occurrences of the four bases. the skew is likely to be most pronounced at the third codon positions of each strand, where any mutational change is synonymous and not subject to selection pressure  <cit> . thus we calculated the gc-skew and at-skew using the third codon positions of each strand. the l strand prefers to use a or c and h strand prefers to use g or t in both acanthaster species, clearly showing strand-specific bias of the nucleotide compositions. the three asteroid species show almost the same tendency of skew, the skew in other five echinoderms , arbacia lixula , ophiopholis aculeata  and ophiura lutkeni ) showed similar bias of skew, although the degree of skew is slightly different among species examined except for florometra serratissima  . in f. serratissima mtdna, the l strand prefers to use g or t and the h strand prefers to use a or c. the pattern of the bias of the skew is likely to be conserved in asteroid species, although the strand-specific bias is not a general rule in echinoderms  <cit> .

the strand specific bias of the a + c content of protein-coding genes is also seen. in short, the a + c content of the h strands in a. planci and a. brevispinus are  <dig> % and  <dig>  %, respectively, whereas those in the l strands are  <dig> % and  <dig>  %, respectively. these values are similar to those of a. pectinifera .

nucleotide and amino acid differences in protein genes
as previously mentioned, the identified protein-coding genes of the a. planci and a. brevispinus mtdna are similar with those of a. pectinifera  <cit>  and of other metazoan mtdna genomes  <cit> . most of the protein-coding genes in these species are identified by sequence comparison with a. pectinifera except for nd <dig> and nd <dig> genes. alignment is difficult to perform because size variations occur near their 5' ends. the 5' ends of nd <dig> and nd <dig> genes in these two species are inferred from the eligible termination codons without overlapping the preceding gene. in the sequence comparison between a. pectinifera and a. planci/brevispinus, significant changes in the number of codons are observed in nd <dig> and nd <dig> genes between the acanthaster species and asterina. the nucleotide sequence of nd <dig> gene in a. pectinifera is  <dig> bp shorter than those of both acanthaster counterparts. on the other hand, both acanthaster nd <dig> gene nucleotide sequences are  <dig> bp shorter than that of a. pectinifera. in both of these cases, most of the deletions are observed near 3' end of each gene.

for the given genes, nucleotide and amino acid differences are compared in the protein-coding genes . the percent similarity of nucleotide sequences between a. planci and a. brevispinus is found to be highest in the co <dig> and co <dig> regions  and lowest in nd <dig> gene  among the  <dig> protein-coding genes. in the amino acid sequences, co <dig> gene is highly conserved , and it seems that atp <dig> has evolved faster than any of the other protein-coding genes . amino acid sequences are generally more conserved than nucleotide sequences because of the functional constraints. therefore, most of the identity values of amino acid sequences are higher than those of nucleotide sequences or almost the same except for atp <dig> gene. the percentage similarity of amino acid sequences in atp <dig> gene is significantly lower than those of nucleotide sequences between acanthaster species and a. pectinifera and also slightly lower even between acanthaster species. the pairwise comparison of the atp <dig> gene among a. planci, a. brevispinus and a. pectinifera has revealed that the nucleotide substitution rates of nonsynonymous sites  are almost the same as those of synonymous sites  , suggesting the cause of this improbable phenomenon. a similar result in atp genes was reported in sea urchins  <cit>  and they showed that the nucleotide substitution rates of nonsynonymous sites are not significantly lower than that of synonymous sites. these data clearly indicate a relaxation of the functional constraints at the amino acid level. they found that the same sequence motif pql is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals at the n-termini of the proteins. when the deduced amino acid sequences were analysed with a computer aided method, the predicted hydrophatic profiles for the corresponding proteins are completely super-imposable. de giorgi et al.  <cit>  stated that in spite of the divergence observed in the primary structure of the genes, the role played may be the same. on the other hand, the loss of atp <dig> has occurred several times in the evolutional process of metazoans  <cit> . as de giorgi et al.  <cit>  suggested, the c-terminal of atp <dig> might evolve extremely rapidly and in a phylum-specific manner.

the atp <dig> and atp <dig> genes of starfish overlap each other by  <dig> nucleotides with a - <dig> frame shift. a similar overlap is found among metazoan mitochondria, although the extent of overlap varies  <cit> . thus, it is easily expected that the functional constraints of atp <dig> gene are not so large and the gene could evolve faster than other protein-coding genes. however, further work is required to clarify the causal relationship in the lower percent similarity of amino acid sequence with that of nucleotide sequence in the acanthaster species and the evolution of atp <dig> genes in asteroid species.

gene initiation and termination
in the case of a. planci,  <dig> of the  <dig> protein-coding genes use atg as an initiation codon. merely nd <dig> and nd4l genes use att whereas nd <dig> gene uses gtg. all initiation codons of a. brevispinus are the same as those of a. planci. the initiation codon atg of nd <dig> gene in the acanthaster species mtdna changes to gtg in asterina pectinifera. most of the a. planci and a. brevispinus mtdna genes terminate with a taa codon, however nd <dig>  nd <dig> and nd <dig> genes terminate with atg. nd <dig> gene of a. brevispinus terminates with atg, however, those of a. planci and a. pectinifera terminate with taa. there is only one t residue between co <dig> or cytb genes and their downstream trna genes in the acanthaster species and a. pectinifera mtdna genomes. furthermore, co <dig> gene in the acanthaster species terminates only with ta residue, whereas the a. pectinifera counterpart has a triplet codon , although co <dig> gene is the most conserved gene among the protein-coding genes . mitochondrial genes commonly employ several alternatives to atg as an initiation codon and to taa or tag as a termination codon  <cit> . however, the mechanism by which these variations occur is not yet well understood  <cit> . as demonstrated in the human mtdna genome  <cit> , we speculate that incomplete termination codons such as t and ta are converted to canonical termination codon taa after the cleavage of the trna gene by ribonuclease.

trna and rrna genes
twenty-two trna genes are identified in a. planci and a. brevispinus mtdna genomes by sequence comparison with known echinoderm trna genes and the deduced potential cloverleaf structures are shown in figure  <dig> 

the trna genes ranged in size from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and they are large enough for encoded trnas to fold into cloverleaf structures. as often found in other metazoan mtdna genomes, trnaser  lacks the dhu loop. the potential secondary structures of trnas are quite similar between a. planci and a. brevispinus, whereas the comparison between the acanthaster species and a. pectinifera reveals that several size variations have occurred at the dhu and tψc loops. the comparison between the dhu and tψx loops shows that size variations are more likely to be found in the dhu loop than the tψx loop.

the echinoderm mitochondrial rrna genes are located separately from each other  <cit> , and this arrangement appears also in a. planci and a. brevispinus mtdna genomes. the 5' and 3' end of 12s rrna genes are defined as immediately adjacent to the ends of the flanking genes trnaphe and trnaglu, in the two acanthaster mtdna genomes. however, an alignment of a. pectinifera does not support their 3' end boundaries; the 12s rrna sequences deduced from the sequence comparison with a. pectinifera overlapped with the beginning of trnaglu by two nucleotides.

although the precise ends of the 16s rrna transcripts cannot be determined without experimentation, the inferred boundaries were determined by sequence comparison with pisaster ochraceus  <cit>  . in contrast to a rather uniform distribution of nucleotide differences over the entire protein-coding genes, although the substitution was mainly seen in the third positions, replacement differences of rrna genes are dispersed in clusters. this variability is due to the secondary structures of rrna genes; the stem regions are relatively conservative, whereas the loop sequences are more variable as is the case of trnas. comparing with 12s rrna genes, 16s rrna genes of asteroid species seem to have more variable sites. this variability may be due to the potential loop structures that have evolved much faster than other regions in rrnas.

unassigned sequence
intergenetic regions represent  <dig> % of a. planci mtdna genome and  <dig> % of a. brevispinus mtdna genome. the largest unassigned regions  are adjacent to 16s rrna and trnathr. the inferred boundaries determined by sequence comparison with p. ochraceus suggest that this region of a. planci spanned  <dig> bp and that of a. brevispinus spanned  <dig> bp. this region contains a stem-loop structure, which is the putative origin of light-strand replication. this structure is observed close to trnathr, and the lengths are  <dig> bp for a. planci and  <dig> bp for a. brevispinus. there is a  <dig> bp stem  and a  <dig> bp loop  in a. planci, and a  <dig> bp stem  and a slightly longer  <dig> bp loop  in a. brevispinus. the second largest unassigned region in length is  <dig> bp in a. planci and  <dig> bp in a. brevispinus and it is located between the nd <dig> and nd <dig> genes. there are neither stem and loop structures nor promoter-like sequences in these short sequences. however, these sequences are as variable as the largest unassigned sequences. in a. pectinifera mtdna genome, the second largest region is found between nd <dig> and trnahis, which extends to  <dig> bp long, whereas in the two acanthaster species it is only  <dig> bp long.

aside from the large two regions, there are  <dig> tatatatataa-like sequences found between the following genes in both acanthaster species: trnaleu and trnagly, trnapro and co <dig>  co <dig> and trnapro, nd <dig> and cytb. except for the region between the genes for trnaleu and trnagly, all other tatatatataa-like sequences are located in the boundaries where the coding strand shifts to the complimentary one. as already pointed out by asakawa et al.  <cit> , these sequences are the possible bi-directional promoters, which play the role for replication and/or transcription. however, the sequence located between 16s rrna and nd <dig> that were reported in a. pectinifera and sea urchin species, strongylocentrotus purpuratus  <cit>  and paracentrotus lividus  <cit>  are not found in the two acanthaster species.

phylogenetic relationship
the complete co <dig> sequences of a. planci and a. brevispinus were subjected to the ml, mp and nj analyses together with the representative asteroid sequences  available in genbank . these three analyses produced almost the same tree topologies. the co <dig> phylogeny indicated that pisaster ochraceus  was the most primitive taxon among asteroids. in these trees, the close affinities of species belonging to the same family , showing monophyly, were well supported. in contrast, the confidence values for the branches linking different families were not so higher. the close affinity between patiriella and asterina species was found and the asterinidae mixed together in the same group, suggesting a non-monophyletic relationship. acanthaster species were positioned closer to oreaster species than any other members in valvatida, suggesting the close genetic affiliation, although the bootstrap values were not so high and these were separated from patiriella and asterina species by relatively high bootstrap supports in the ml method. a. planci and a. brevispinus were the closest species showing  <dig> % homology between the two sequences, but these were consistently separated by 100% bootstrap supports in the tree. luidia quinalia and astropecten polyacanthus were grouped together and separated from acanthaster, oreaster, patiriella and asterina species. in the asteroid phylogeny using mitochondrial 12s rrna and 16s rrna also, the monophyly of each family was well supported  <cit>  but the monophyly of asterinidae was not clearly indicated from their ml and mp analyses as well as our data. in this study, p. ochraceus  was the most primitive taxon among the asteroids. on the other hand, the mitochondrial 12s rrna and 16s rrna phylogenetic trees  <cit>  do not support the early divergence of asteriidae such as asterias amurensis and coscinasterias acutispina. our data suggested the close affinity between luidia and astropecten species , however,  <cit>  reported a contradictory result that astropecten species were not positioned close to luidia species but grouped leiaster leachii and certonardoa semiregularis . the reason, why the different topology between co <dig> and mitochondrial 12s rrna and 16s rrna sequences was obtained, is unclear. the phylogenetic relationships among asteroids remain extremely controversial in spite of many morphological and molecular studies that have been applied to this issue  <cit> .

applications of mtdna sequence of a. planci
a. brevispinus is a very rare species and was once considered as only as a short-spined individual of a. planci  <cit> . however, birkeland & lucas  <cit>  and lucas & johns  <cit>  reported that a. planci and a. brevispinus are genetically compatible to the extent that fertile f <dig> hybrids were produced. however, f <dig> hybrids and backcrosses were of poor viability and some of them showed morphological abnormalities, suggesting that there are barriers to introgression of genetic material between the species.

protein and dna technologies have provided strategies for identification when morphological features are of limited value  <cit> . a method to identify a. planci larvae using monoclonal antibodies provided by hanna et al.  is not perfect because the monoclonal antibodies do not ensure discrimination among coral reef asteroids other than culsita novaeguineae. as mentioned in the background of this study, a species-specific genetic marker of a. planci is essential to reveal the larval ecology in the field study. recent investigations have suggested the feasibility of creating identification systems reliant on the analysis of sequence in small segments of dna  <cit> . hebert et al.  <cit>  focused this discussion by proposing that a dna barcoding system for animal life could be based upon sequence diversity in cytochrome c oxidase subunit  <dig> . they summarized co <dig> sequence divergences for  <dig>  congeneric pairs of animal species belonging to  <dig> phyla. most pairs  showed greater than 8% sequence divergence and more than 98% of species pairs showed greater than 2% sequence divergence in their study  in echinodamata). therefore, most congeneric species pairs of animals showed enough sequence divergence to ensure their easy diagnosis, because intraspecific divergences are rarely greater than 2% and most are less than 1%  <cit> . in the comparison of a complete co <dig> sequence of a. planci with the genetically closest species a. brevispinus, the sequence convergence was  <dig> %. the phylogenetic tree inferred from the complete co <dig> sequences also clearly showed the high divergence among asteroid species. in addition, no sequence variation of the partial co <dig> gene  was confirmed among the  <dig> a. planci specimens collected from different localities . accordingly these results indicate that the identification system for asteroid species based on the co <dig> gene will be highly effective and it will easily provide the effective regions for species-specific markers. moreover, universal primers for metazoan invertebrates in the co <dig> genes were already provided  <cit> , therefore, pcr-rflp  assay can also be applied as another tool for species identification of a. planci.

for polymorphic marker using mtdna variation, the desirable characteristics are as follows: evolutional rate is rapid enough to distinguish among local populations and substitutions are neutral. in a. planci mtdna sequence, the largest unassigned region between trnathe and 16s rrna is most variable. in this region, size variations ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp are observed in the  <dig> individuals. the variation includes  <dig> base substitutions and  <dig> deletions/insertions ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp . these sequences can be useful in the analysis of intraspecific variation of a. planci collected from several localities.

CONCLUSIONS
the complete mitochondrial genome sequences of acanthaster planci and its sibling, rare species, a. brevispinus were determined and compared with another known asteroid species, asterina pectinifera. the genome contains  <dig> genes most commonly found in metazoan mtdna and they are in the same order as in a. pectinifera. characteristics of the two acanthaster species are quite similar when compared with a. pectinifera, though there exist some significant differences between them especially in the unassigned regions. the sequence information will be useful for molecular ecological studies of a. planci in future.
