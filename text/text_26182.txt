BACKGROUND
ultraviolet b  radiation is the most active, albeit minor, constituent of solar light. uvb has both direct and indirect adverse biological effects that may result in photo-aging and photo-carcinogenesis. the dna damage caused by uvb irradiation is considered to be responsible for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma  <cit> . uvb is also suspected of lowering the immune defence system of the skin  <cit> . given these effects, the gene expression of dermal fibroblasts after uvb irradiation has become a significant area of study, with a total of  <dig> manuscripts found in pubmed using the keyword 'uvb' just within the last year.

quantitative real-time pcr  is the most powerful method used to quantify gene expression. similar to other expression study methods, the sample data are usually required to be normalised against either another data set or particular references to correct for any differences in the amount of starting material. at present, the most common normalisation method involves the use of a single internal control reference gene, often selected from a set of genes referred to as 'housekeeping' genes that are constitutively expressed in certain tissues and/or under certain circumstances. there is strong evidence in the literature, however, to suggest that the expression of some of these reference genes may be constant under certain conditions but may also fluctuate significantly under other conditions  <cit> . commonly accepted reference genes, such as actb  and gapdh , have been shown to be affected by particular in vitro experimental conditions and some clinical conditions, such as asthma  <cit> , thus indicating that they may not always be suitable candidates for normalisation  <cit> . the normalisation of data using a non-validated reference gene could lead to inaccurate results and therefore erroneous conclusions. previous studies have reinforced the need to validate reference genes prior to their use in a study. cytoskeletal protein genes, including actb, tuba1a , and tubb <dig> , have been used as reference genes for many experimental conditions.

the cytoskeleton is the cellular 'scaffolding' or 'skeleton' that is contained within the cytoplasm. its concept and term  were first introduced by the french embryologist paul wintrebert in  <dig>  <cit> . the cytoskeleton is composed of three types of protein filaments: actin filaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules  <cit> . the cytoskeleton was once thought to be unique to eukaryotes, but recent research has identified a prokaryotic cytoskeleton  <cit> . the cytoskeleton is a dynamic structure that maintains cell shape, protects the cell, enables cellular movement, and plays important roles in both intracellular transport and cell division  <cit> . not only is it an indispensable protein complex for all cells, including eukaryotes and prokaryotes, but it also serves as a multifunctional tool because many of its proteins can be used as reference genes for a variety of experimental studies.

our previous studies have demonstrated that fibroblasts increased the expression of vimentin, a cytoskeleton protein, after irradiation by uvb  <cit> . whether the expression levels of other cytoskeletal genes, such as actb, tuba1a, and tubb <dig>  are altered after uvb irradiation and consequently whether any of these genes are suitable reference genes remain unknown. in this study, primary human dermal fibroblasts were treated with different doses of uvb radiation, and the irradiated cells were analysed at different time points. the gene expression of four cytoskeletal genes  after irradiation was compared with another common reference gene, gapdh. these five genes were also analysed with respect to their suitability as reference genes for expression studies in healthy and irradiated fibroblasts. to define the most stable reference genes for these study conditions, the expression changes between and within these two groups were investigated and analysed using two software products available free online.

RESULTS
assessment of pre-analytical and analytical variables
the determination of the primary cell type was the basis of these experiments. fibroblasts express vimentin, whereas keratinocytes express keratin. thus, the cells isolated from the foreskin samples were examined to determine if vimentin and/or keratin were expressed at both the mrna transcript and protein levels. in fibroblasts, pcr results in a bright, specific band for the vimentin primers but no specific products for the keratin <dig> primers by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis analysis. the opposite pattern was seen in the hacat keratinocyte cell line . fibre bundles in the cytoplasm along the cell axis stained green, while the nucleus stained orange by fluorescent immunohistochemical analysis in fibroblasts. these same fibroblasts were negative for the expression of the keratin protein . taken together, these results indicated that highly pure human dermal fibroblasts were successfully obtained from the foreskin samples.

in rt-qpcr experiments, there are many pre-analytical variables, including the collection and storage of samples and the rna isolation method, that determine the quality of the rna that is used for the subsequent quantitative expression analyses. therefore, the rna samples isolated from the  <dig> matched normal and irradiated fibroblasts were characterised with respect to their concentration, purity, and integrity. only high quality rna samples were included in this study to avoid erroneous conclusions. the mean a260/ <dig> ratio of the rna samples was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , reflecting pure and protein-free rna. the rna integrity as an essential quality criterion was characterised using the so-called rna integrity number , measured by the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer. the mean rin value  of the rna samples was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  .

pooled cdna samples were used as a precision control for each gene-specific pcr run. these controls were adjusted to calculate the pcr efficiency as described in the methods. the mean pcr efficiencies varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the between-run analytical performances of the rt-pcr measurements were determined using these controls, and the between-run variations  ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. the standard deviation  for the triplicate reactions ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cycles .

uvb suppressed the expression of tuba1a and vim in cultured human dermal fibroblasts
to determine whether uvb affects the expression of cytoskeletal genes in cultured human fibroblasts, the fibroblasts were exposed to various doses of uvb . after uvb irradiation, the fibroblasts were cultured for  <dig> h, and then total rna was extracted from the cells. qpcr was performed to determine the changes in the expression of these cytoskeletal genes. as common reference genes, the expression levels of actb, gapdh and tubb <dig> were not significantly different between the normal and irradiated fibroblasts . doses of  <dig> and  <dig> mj/cm <dig> did not alter the expression levels of tuba1a , but they were significantly reduced at doses ≥ <dig> mj/cm <dig> . the expression of vim began to be significantly reduced after exposure to a uvb dose of  <dig> mj/cm <dig> . the decreased expression of vim became even more pronounced at doses of  <dig> and  <dig> mj/cm <dig> when compared with  <dig> and  <dig> mj/cm <dig> . the mrna expression levels of tuba1a and vim were reduced by varied uvb intensities.

to determine whether the time after exposure to uvb affects the expression of cytoskeletal protein genes in cultured human fibroblasts, total rna was extracted at different time points  after exposure to a  <dig> mj/cm <dig> uvb dose. this dose did not have a significant effect on the expression levels of gapdh, actb and tubb <dig> at the time points up to  <dig> h post-irradiation . the expression of tuba1a didn't show statistically significant difference at the  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> h though it was decreased by  <dig> mj/cm <dig> of uvb . t. the vim mrna level decreased after exposure to a uvb dose of  <dig> mj/cm <dig> , and this decrease appeared to be time dependent, with greater decreases seen after  <dig> and  <dig> h compared with those seen at  <dig> and  <dig> h post-exposure . thus, neither tuba1a nor vim is a suitable reference gene for research involving uvb-irradiated human fibroblasts.

expression levels and ranges of the reference gene candidates
although the expression levels of tuba1a and vim were significantly reduced in fibroblasts after exposure to uvb, they were still evaluated as potential reference genes along with actb, gapdh and tubb <dig>  the expression levels of these five candidates , shown in terms of ct-values, are given as box-and-whisker plots in figure  <dig>  the boxes represent the median ct-values and the inter-quartile ranges, while the whiskers indicate the min-max ranges. genes with higher expression levels show lower ct-values under the specific pcr conditions, and genes with lower expression levels have inversely higher cycle numbers. the five candidate reference genes showed a wide range of expression levels with ct values falling between  <dig> and  <dig> cycles. the median ct values were in the range usually covered by reference genes, varying from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . the genes could be divided into two groups: a group of genes with a median ct value below  <dig>  or above  <dig>  . there was a trend of higher median ct values of all reference genes in irradiated fibroblasts compared to normal fibroblasts. however, the difference was not big enough to conclude that the actb, gapdh, and tubb <dig> expression levels differed between normal and irradiated fibroblasts. tuba1a and vim had significantly different expression levels in normal and irradiated fibroblasts . individual candidate reference genes also showed different expression ranges across all studied samples. tubb <dig> and actb showed the smallest ct value variability in normal  and irradiated  fibroblasts, respectively, while tuba1a  and tuba1a  showed the largest variance in normal and irradiated fibroblasts.

expression stability of reference gene candidates
the normfinder algorithm was used to rank the five irradiated fibroblast reference gene candidates according to their expression stability . as revealed by the analysis, actb, characterised by the stability value of  <dig> , had the most stable expression levels and thus was selected by the algorithm as the best choice for a single reference gene for expression studies in normal and irradiated fibroblasts. tubb1and gapdh were ranked as the second- and third-best reference genes, respectively. two commonly used reference genes, tuba1a and vim, were ranked last, suggesting that they should not be considered as reliable reference genes for expression assay studies involving fibroblasts. the programme additionally identified actb and tubb <dig> as the best combination of two reference genes.

normfinder can also be used to calculate the intragroup variation. the variation of the five candidate genes in normal and matched irradiated fibroblast pairs are presented in table  <dig>  the variation of actb in the normal and matched irradiated fibroblasts was the lowest, whereas tuba1a and vim had the largest variance. the expression of vim began to be significantly reduced after exposure to a uvb dose of  <dig> mj/cm <dig>  with an even more pronounced reduction at  <dig> and  <dig> mj/cm <dig>  which may explain the variance of vim expression seen in the irradiated fibroblasts.

the expression level stability of the candidate genes in normal and irradiated fibroblasts was also investigated using the genorm programme. the curve presented in figure  <dig> represents the stepwise exclusion of the least stable candidate reference gene. this algorithm confirmed the results obtained by normfinder, showing that tuba1a and vim were the least stable reference genes, while the combination of actb and tubb <dig> was the most stable gene pair .

the genorm analysis also allows for evaluation of the optimal number of reference genes required for a reliable and accurate normalisation of expression data. it is suggested that the vn/vn+ <dig> cut-off value of  <dig>  should be considered as a limit beneath which the involvement of additional reference genes would not be required  <cit> . however, based on our experimental data, the variation vn/vn+ <dig> did not reach this cut-off; the observed variability ranged from  <dig>  for the addition of a third reference gene  to  <dig>  for the addition of five reference genes  . with the increase in the number of genes, the variation vn/vn +  <dig> did not decrease. this may be related to the changes in tuba1a and vim.

discussion
the fluorescence-based quantitative real-time pcr  has the capacity to detect and measure minute amounts of nucleic acids in a wide range of samples from numerous sources, enabling it to be the technology par excellence for multiple applications in molecular diagnostics, life sciences, agriculture, and medicine  <cit> . the remarkable lack of consensus on the best qpcr methods for different experiments, however, has the adverse consequence of perpetuating a string of serious shortcomings that encumber its status as an independent yardstick. in  <dig>  a set of "miqe" guidelines were proposed to establish a minimum standard for the required information that should be included in publications utilising qpcr experiments  <cit> . in the experiment described herein, we adhered to the miqe guidelines to the best of our abilities. the rna extracted from the primary fibroblasts was validated by immunofluorescence, with its quantity, quality and integrity subsequently determined. all rna meeting the minimum experimental standards was stored at -80°c and was utilised within two month. primer specificity was confirmed by melting curve analyses. pcr efficiency plots were calculated using a standard curve with the coefficient of correlation  between  <dig>  and  <dig> , and the pcr efficiency of all primers used in this study varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> . to ensure consistency between reactions, the same quantity of rna was used, and both rt and qpcr were performed in triplicate. all of these steps ensured the reliability of this experiment and the comparability of the statistical data that was generated.

another important factor that may affect qpcr results is the selection of the reference genes. actb, gapdh, 18s and 28s rrna are the most commonly used reference genes, but a number of studies have provided solid evidence that their transcription levels vary significantly among different individuals, cell types, developmental stages, and/or experimental conditions  <cit> . herein, our aim was to identify genes with the lowest expression variability and validate their use for qpcr data normalisation in expression studies on irradiated fibroblasts, employing two different techniques. to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to analyse the expression stability of reference gene candidates in fibroblasts exposed to uvb radiation. our previous studies demonstrated that the expression of vimentin, a cytoskeletal protein, was increased in fibroblasts after uvb irradiation. thus, this study focused on cytoskeletal proteins commonly used as references, which were actb, tuba1a, tubb <dig>  and vim, in addition to another common reference gene, gapdh.

the two approaches used to analyse the expression stability of the selected reference genes in our study were genorm and normfinder. the genorm application measures gene expression stability , which is the mean pairwise variation between an individual gene and all other tested reference genes. during this analysis, the least stable genes  were sequentially eliminated until only the two most stable genes remained. in addition, the genorm programme can determine the optimal number of genes required for accurate normalisation by calculating pair-wise variations between consecutively determined normalisation factors of n and n+ <dig> genes . in the original publication describing genorm  <cit> , a threshold of  <dig>  was established for the pairwise variation, below which the inclusion of additional reference genes is considered to be unnecessary. normfinder, which is rooted in a mathematical model of gene expression, uses a solid statistical framework to estimate not only the overall expression variation of the normalisation gene candidates, but also the variation between subgroups within a sample set .

in this study, actb had the most stable expression, making it the most suitable reference gene for qpcr data normalisation in normal and irradiated fibroblasts. surprisingly, gapdh, which is one of the most commonly used endogenous controls, was the third most stable gene in this study. there has been an increasing number of reports in the literature documenting the variability of the levels of gapdh mrna under a variety of physiological and pathological conditions  <cit> . the use of gapdh as a reference gene in the majority of tumour types, including melanoma, has recently been challenged  <cit> . tuba1a is also commonly used as an endogenous control. in this study, however, the expression of tuba1a decreased after uvb exposure using doses greater than  <dig> mj/cm <dig>  making it unsuitable as a reference gene for research involving irradiated fibroblasts. among the examined reference gene candidates, tuba1a lies in the middle with respect to its suitability as a reference gene. a separate study by spanier ki determined that tuba1a was a particularly ill-suited reference gene in the daphnia pulex genome sequence  <cit> .

in other studies involving qpcr, there was a trend towards the use of more than one reference gene. as described above, the genorm programme can determine the optimal number of reference genes required for the reliable and accurate normalisation of expression data, with the vn/vn+ <dig> cut-off value, which indicates the threshold at which additional reference genes are considered unnecessary, being set at  <dig>   <cit> . the v2/v <dig> value of  <dig>  obtained in this study was close to the cut-off value of  <dig> . the vn/n+ <dig> value presented an unusual trend in our study, with v2/v <dig> giving the lowest value. this observation was likely due to the changes seen in the expression levels of tuba1a and vim.

although our previous studies have shown that the protein expression levels of vimentin were increased in fibroblasts, our results herein showed that the vim mrna expression level was reduced by uvb irradiation. these two observations appear to contradict each other, and the underlying mechanism for these differences is unclear. many studies have shown that vimentin cleavage has an impact on the integrity and the dynamics of the intracellular structures that are targets of destruction during apoptosis  <cit> . based on that data, we speculate that the over-accumulation of the vimentin protein is one of the factors that contribute to the resistance of skin fibroblasts against environmental stresses. in addition, although tuba1a expression was significantly reduced by exposure to uvb at doses greater than  <dig> mj/cm <dig>  there was no apparent change in the levels of the tuba1a protein. unfortunately, these results do not provide any insight as to whether the changes in the vim and tuba1a expression levels correlate with ultraviolet radiation-induced skin damage. cytoskeleton-deficient cells could be used to detect interactions of the cytoskeleton with the corresponding proteins and the signal transduction pathway involved in the response to uvb irradiation.

CONCLUSIONS
based on our results, the expression of the tuba1a and vim transcripts decreased in fibroblasts after uvb exposure, and thus, they were not suitable for use as reference genes. instead, we recommend that actb be used as a single reference gene for qpcr data normalisation in gene expression studies in normal and irradiated fibroblasts. the addition of tubb <dig> to actb for use as a pair of reference genes is recommended for more accurate normalisation. finally, we emphasise that the utility of the selected reference gene must be confirmed by each research group for each particular experimental setup.
