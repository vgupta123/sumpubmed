BACKGROUND
the interplay between the bacterial assemblages in the gastrointestinal tract  and the intestinal epithelium  is an important determinant of host health and nutritional status. the interactions between pathogens and enterocytes activate signaling pathways that trigger disruption of the cytoskeleton and the tight junctions that link epithelial cells, alter expression of proinflammatory molecules, and stimulate secretion of fluid and electrolytes  <cit> . in contrast, members of the commensal gut flora that are considered as beneficial increase resistance to pathogens by modulating the host immune system and increase secretory iga  <cit>  upregulate expression of genes coding for mucin- <dig>  and human beta defensin- <dig> expression  <cit> , compete with enteric pathogens for adhesion sites and nutrients  <cit> , and produce bacteriocins  <cit> . moreover the interactions between bacteria and enterocytes can elicit the synthesis of heat shock proteins  <cit> , which up-regulate the activity of enterocyte glucose transporters  <cit>  and modulate the activity of na+/h+ exchangers  <cit> .

the influences of pathogens and beneficial bacteria on epithelial cells can be mediated by direct bacteria-cell contacts or indirectly via bacterial metabolites, such as toxins from pathogens [e.g., cholera toxin, e. coli heat stabile toxin) and short chain fatty acids from commensal bacteria . supplementing the diet with probiotic bacteria can increase small intestine absorption of nutrients  <cit>  and electrolytes  <cit> , and when added to culture media increase calcium uptake by caco- <dig> cells  <cit> . microarray analyses have revealed that long-term exposure to commensal bacteria and specific strains of probiotics  up-regulates genes involved in postnatal intestinal maturation, angiogenesis, and mucosal barrier functions, whereas genes associated with apoptosis and inflammation were down-regulated  <cit> .

absorption of glucose by enterocytes is mediated in part by the concentrative, high affinity, sodium-dependent glucose transporter , with rates of uptake dependent on the densities and activities of the sglt <dig>  historically, studies of glucose uptake regulation have focused on the patterns of gene expression , leading to changes in the abundances of transporter proteins. this include responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharides  <cit> . enterocytes also have the ability to rapidly  and reversibly regulate nutrient absorption independent of changes in the total cellular abundance of transporter proteins  <cit> . this non-genomic regulation of nutrient transporters allows enterocytes to adapt to the transient changes in luminal nutrient concentrations that occur before, during, and after the processing of meals.

previous studies have reported the influences of probiotic bacteria on nutrient absorption, but have used prolonged periods of administration or exposure . as a result, the reported responses can be attributed to genomic regulation of the transporters. the present study demonstrates for the first time that metabolites produced by probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus and four other species of lactobacilli upregulate enterocyte glucose transport within  <dig> min of exposure using caco- <dig> cells as a model for the intestine.

RESULTS
growth of bacteria
based on increases in absorption measured at  <dig> nm, the cdm-fructose and cdm-mannose elicited similar patterns of growth for l. acidophilus . however, after  <dig> h of anaerobic culture densities in cdm-fructose and cdm-mannose  were lower compared to mrs broth . although cdm-glucose elicited an earlier increase in growth compared with cdm with fructose and mannose , densities at  <dig> h were not higher compared with cdm-fructose and cdm-mannose cultures. the cdm alone or with arabinose, ribose, and xylose did not support the growth of l. acidophilus.

growth curves for l. acidophilus, l. amylovorus, l. gallinarum and l. johnsonii cultured in the cdm-fructose were virtually identical . although the growth of l gasseri started earlier, the peak in absorption at  <dig> nm was achieved at about the same time as the other species.

glucose uptake by caco- <dig> cells
exposure of the caco- <dig> cells for  <dig> min to sterile mrs broth and to sterile cdm without carbohydrate decreased glucose accumulation by 91% and 82%, respectively, compared to cells exposed to the control solution  . glucose accumulation by the cells also decreased  when the  <dig> mm mannitol in the control hbss was replaced by ribose , fructose , mannose , and glucose . replacement of mannitol by xylose and arabinose did not reduce glucose uptake. based on these findings, cdm-fructose was selected as the carbohydrate source for the further studies because 1) it supported the growth of l. acidophilus and the other species of lactobacilli, but 2) did not inhibit glucose accumulation by caco- <dig> cells as much as the cdm with glucose or mannose.

exposure time and glucose uptake
glucose uptake by caco- <dig> cells increased with longer exposures to the cell-free supernatant prepared after culturing l acidophilus for  <dig> h in cdm-fructose  . glucose uptake after a  <dig> min exposure to the supernatant was 40% higher compared with cells exposed to sterile cdm-fructose  .

responses of caco- <dig> cells to supernatants collected at different stages of bacterial growth

the supernatant prepared from cdm-fructose  during the exponential phase of growth of l. acidophilus  resulted in the greatest increase in glucose uptake after a  <dig> min exposure compared with the sterile cdm-fructose . the supernatant collected at the stationary phase of growth  resulted in a 45% increase in uptake , whereas the supernatant collected before exponential growth  did not elicit a significant increase in uptake.

responses of caco- <dig> cells to heated supernatants
supernatants of cdm-fructose, and cdm-mannose harvested after  <dig> h of l. acidophilus growth increased glucose uptake by 40% and 93%, respectively, compared to caco- <dig> cells exposed to the same media before the addition of bacteria . in contrast, the corresponding heated supernatants caused a non-significant increase in glucose uptake by the cells.

response of caco- <dig> cells to supernatants from the five species of lactobacilli
rates of glucose uptake differed among caco- <dig> cells exposed to supernatants prepared from cdm-fructose after  <dig> h of culturing the five species of lactobacilli. all of the supernatants increased glucose uptake by the cells compared to the sterile cdm-fructose . the greatest stimulation of glucose uptake was elicited by the supernatant prepared after growth of l. gasseri , followed by l. acidophilus , l. amylovorus ,l. gallinarum , and l. johnsonii .

discussion
the present findings demonstrate that metabolites produced by five species of lactobacilli cultured anaerobically in a chemically defined medium cause a rapid increase in glucose uptake by caco- <dig> cells. the response occurs too fast to be explained by the synthesis of new proteins and can therefore be considered as non-genomic. the increased uptake can be explained by the trafficking of existing transporters from a cytosolic source to the bbm or by the activation of transporters already present in the bbm. the rapid response to the metabolites resulting from the culture of probiotic bacteria is a novel finding and demonstrates a heretofore unrecognized interaction between probiotic bacteria and the intestine.

glucose is transported across the bbm of enterocytes by a combination of sglt <dig> and the low affinity, high capacity facilitative glucose transporter  <dig>   <cit> . since the uptake solution contained tracer concentration of glucose  the majority of glucose accumulated by the caco- <dig> cells would have been via sglt <dig>  there would be little or no uptake via the lower affinity glut <dig>  which is dependent on a concentration gradient to drive absorption. this was verified in preliminary studies by the reduced accumulation of tracer glucose in the presence of phloridzin to inhibit sglt <dig>  but not when phloretin was used to inhibit glut <dig>  therefore, the increased accumulation of glucose by the caco- <dig> cells was most likely dependent on higher densities or activities of sglt <dig> in the bbm.

exposure of the caco0- <dig> cells for  <dig> min to the  <dig> mm glucose in mrs broth and the  <dig> mm in the hbss-glucose depressed glucose uptake by 90%, whereas exposing the cells to mannose, ribose, and fructose to hbss, which are not high affinity substrates for sglt <dig>  also inhibited glucose uptake by varying percentages. similarly, sglt <dig> mediated uptake of Î±-methyl-d-glucopyranoside by cos- <dig> cells is inhibited by exposure to fructose and mannose  <cit> . the lack of decline in glucose uptake after exposure of the cells to hbss with arabinose, xylose, and mannitol corresponds with the negligible affinity of these sugars for sglt <dig>  collectively, these findings indicate competition for sglt <dig> transporter sites is partly responsible for the variable decreases in glucose accumulation by caco- <dig> cells exposed to hbss with the different monosaccharides or to the cdm with and without fructose. an alternative explanation is that the variation in glucose accumulation may be related to cellular metabolism of the monosaccharides. specifically, enterocytes can transport and metabolize glucose, fructose  <cit> , ribose  <cit> , and mannose  <cit> , all of which decreased glucose accumulation, despite the varying affinities for sglt <dig>  in contrast, absorption and metabolism of arabinose and xylose are limited, corresponding with a lack of influence on glucose accumulation. although caco- <dig> cells can metabolize glucose and fructose  <cit> , which decrease glucose accumulation, we are unaware of information for the other sugars used in the present study. enterocytes can metabolize other components of the cdm, notably amino acids. hence, the 82% lower glucose uptake by the cells after exposure to carbohydrate-free cdm may be triggered by the metabolism of non-carbohydrate components of the cdm  by the caco- <dig> cells during the  <dig> min exposure.

the results from the heated supernatant address a critical concern that bacterial metabolism reduced or removed components of the cdm that reduce glucose accumulation or can be metabolized by caco- <dig> cells . if this was so, glucose accumulation by caco- <dig> cells would have been similar after exposure to the heated and unheated supernatants. instead, glucose accumulation by caco- <dig> cells was lower after exposure to the heated supernatant. this indicates that one or more heat labile bacterial metabolites are responsive for triggering a non-genomic increase in glucose uptake.

the bacterial metabolites responsible for the increased glucose uptake were not identified. likely candidates include short chain fatty acids , which are known to cause a genomic increase in the abundance and activity of sglt <dig> and glut <dig>  <cit> , the brush border membrane  na+/h+ exchanger  <dig>   <cit> , and increase calcium absorption  <cit> . polyamines are another category of bacterial metabolite that increase glucose transport by cultured enterocytes  <cit> . because scfa and polyamines are heat labile, concentrations in the heated supernatant would have been lower, corresponding with the reduced stimulation of glucose accumulation.

the types or proportions of metabolites produced vary during the different phases of bacterial growth. this is evident from greater increase in glucose uptake in response to supernatant collected during the exponential phase of l. acidophilus growth  compared to the stationary phase . moreover, the present results suggest the types or proportions of metabolites produced vary among species of probiotic lactobacilli. specifically, the supernatant from l. gasseri, which grew faster and resulted in higher densities than the four other probiotic lactobacilli, elicited the greatest increase in glucose accumulation; 83% increase relative to cells exposed to cdm before bacterial culture. although the growth curves and peak densities for the four other species of lactobacilli were virtually identical , the resulting supernatants elicited varying increases in glucose accumulation .

CONCLUSIONS
the present findings indicate that unknown metabolites produced by probiotic lactobacilli elicit rapid, non-genomic responses in the ability of intestinal epithelial cells to transport glucose. whether genomic responses are also induced is unknown. the responses of ca and na uptake to bacterial metabolites  suggest the rapid stimulation of glucose transport triggered by the metabolites from lactobacilli will be shared by carriers for other nutrients. there is an obvious need to identify the specific bacterial metabolites that elicit desired responses  and the bacterial species and conditions that promote the production.
