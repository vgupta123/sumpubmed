BACKGROUND
bacterial species belonging to the rhizobiaceae are common inhabitants of the soil and the rhizosphere. most of them are able to establish a symbiotic relationship with the roots of leguminous plants through the formation of nodules, where bacteria differentiate into nitrogen fixing bacteroids  <cit> . the genomes of these bacteria contain a circular chromosome. some, like agrobacterium tumefaciens, also contain a linear chromosome, in addition to a variable number of plasmids, which may carry up to 50% of the genomic sequence. the bacterial genetic information required for the establishment of the symbiosis is usually localized on large plasmids, or in genomic islands  <cit> .

conjugative transfer is thought to be the most relevant mechanism that contributes to the dissemination and diversification of genetic information, particularly that localized on plasmids. conjugation systems are constituted by a dna transfer and replication  component, encoded by tra genes and a cis-acting orit site, and a mating pair formation  component, encoded by trb genes  <cit> . information on the conjugative transfer mechanisms of rhizobial plasmids is still scarce. however, two groups of plasmids containing a functional set of conjugative transfer genes have been described: type i, which are regulated by quorum-sensing  <cit> , and type ii, which have permanently rcta-repressed transfer genes  <cit> . a third type of conjugative plasmids has been recently proposed, represented by the largest plasmids of r. leguminosarum bv viciae strains  <cit> . some plasmids are mobilizable in the presence of transmissible plasmids, either by cointegration   <cit> , or by classical  helper mechanisms  <cit> . specifically in the bean nodulating type strain rhizobium etli cfn <dig>  we have previously shown that it contains a quorum-sensing regulated self-transmissible plasmid   <cit> , and that transfer of the symbiotic plasmid  occurs only in the presence of pret42a. the event requires cointegration of both replicons. this may be achieved through inta-dependent site-specific recombination between atta and attd sites, or through reca-dependent homologous recombination among large sequence segments shared between the replicons. the cointegrate is able to transfer, using the pret42a-encoded machinery. in the transconjugants, the cointegrate is usually resolved to regenerate the wild-type plasmids, but in a few cases, resolution of the cointegrate leads to the formation of recombinant plasmids that contain segments of each plasmid, pret42a and pret42d  <cit> . mesoamerica has been identified as the place of origin of bean plants and rhizobium etli bacteria  <cit> , while soybean and its nodulating bacteria  originated in east asia  <cit> . in the early xvith century, common beans and their symbionts were transported to europe and other parts of the world. a survey of bean-nodulating strains in granada, spain, showed the presence of strains belonging to five different species: r. etli, r. gallicum, r. giardinii, r. leguminosarum and s. fredii  <cit> . the usual host of sinorhizobium fredii strains is soybean , not common bean . nevertheless, the bean-nodulating strains classified as s. fredii, were unable to nodulate cvs. williams or peking of glycine max. hybridization of digested genomic dna with nodb and nifh genes from r. etli, showed a very weak signal  <cit> . r. etli bv phaseoli symbiotic plasmids  are characterized by the presence of three copies of nifh. the bean-nodulating s. fredii strains showed only one copy of this gene  <cit> . while conjugative transfer may explain the acquisition of new symbiotic features by strains belonging to diverse species, the relationship between r. etli and bean-nodulating s. fredii is not so easily established. in order to gain further insight into the mechanisms and pathways leading to the generation of new rhizobial strains, in this work we present the analysis of the bean-nodulating s. fredii strain gr <dig>  isolated from the soil in granada. the results indicate that the plasmids present in gr <dig> likely derived from conjugative transfer and rearrangement events among sequences localized in at least three different replicons, including two different plasmids and a chromosome.

RESULTS
plasmid psfr64b is required for symbiosis but psfr64a is dispensable
strain gr <dig> contains two plasmids: psfr64a  and psfr64b  . a band corresponding to a megaplasmid , has been visualized  <cit> , but is not always clearly apparent in the gels. plasmid psfr64b was identified as the symbiotic plasmid  <cit> , because it hybridizes with the nifh gene. nodulation assays confirmed that the genetic information in psfr64b is necessary and sufficient to establish symbiosis. table  <dig> shows that all derivatives carrying psfr64b, were able to form nodules , and that the construct lacking psfr64b  was unable to nodulate beans. consistent with previous findings  <cit> , the number of nodules was decreased in an agrobacterium genomic background. on the other hand, lack of psfr64a had no effect on the symbiotic process , and its presence in agrobacterium did not confer nodulation capacity to the receptor, indicating that psfr64a encodes none of the essential symbiotic genes.

plasmid psfr64a shares sequences with the r. etli psym, pret42a, and with the chromosome of sinorhizobium fredii ngr234
we sequenced plasmid psfr64a . the main features of this plasmid are shown in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  plasmid psfr64a is  <dig>  <dig> bp long. the genetic organization of this plasmid clearly reveals its chimeric nature, since  <dig>  of the  <dig> orfs encoded in the plasmid presented highest similarity to sequences of the chromosome of sinorhizobium fredii ngr <dig>  while  <dig>  were most similar to orfs encoded in r. etli cfn <dig> plasmids pret42a  and pret42d .

the functional assignment of the  <dig> orfs  shows that the plasmid is largely involved in metabolic, transport and conjugative functions.

a number of psfr64a orfs assigned to each functional category.

b number of psfr64a orfs in each category, with highest similarity to orfs from pret42d.

c number of psfr64a orfs in each category, with highest similarity to orfs from pret42a.

d number of psfr64a orfs in each category, with highest similarity to orfs from the chromosome of ngr <dig> 

among the orfs shared between psfr64a and pret42a, the self-transmissible plasmid of cfn <dig>  most are related to conjugative transfer , only two were ascribed to macromolecular metabolism. interestingly, both are related to dna metabolism, one was classified as a putative nuclease, and the other as a probable dna methylase. in figure  <dig>  it can be appreciated that the genomic region shared between pret42a and psfr64a is markedly colinear. colinearity is disrupted by the absence of an homolog to the regulatory gene cinr of pret42a, and the presence of psfr64a orfs  <dig> and  <dig>  which encode hypothetical proteins. the correspondence between psfr64a and pretcfn <dig> orfs is presented in additional file  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows that the segment of psfr64a shared with pret42a has a high gc content, compared to the rest of the plasmid. this feature is also present in the similar pret42a sequence.

the orfs similar to the psym of cfn <dig>  include the repabc genes . this is congruent with our finding that psfr64a and pret42d are incompatible . the psfr64a-pret42d-shared orfs are mainly involved in small molecule metabolism , and carbohydrate transport . it is noteworthy that, in spite of the fact that pret42d carries genes engaged in symbiotic functions, none of these are present in psfr64a.

within the region similar to pret42d , the colinearity is restricted to small segments, some of them in inverse orientation. . the repabc genes  were adjacent to the transfer region, separated from the other pret42d genes. it has been amply documented that plasmid pret42d is subject to frequent genomic rearrangements, due to the presence of reiterations and a high density of insertion sequences  <cit> . r. etli orfs encoding transposon-related proteins located near to the sites where colinearity is disrupted are indicated in figure  <dig>  and additional file  <dig>  for example, psfr64a orfs  <dig> to  <dig> are colinear with pret42a orfs  <dig> to  <dig>  the adjacent orf on pret42a  encodes a transposon-related protein. it is possible that these sequences are related to the generation of rearrangements, causing the interruptions in colinearity. orfs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> show homology to orfs encoded in another rhizobium etli strain; ie <dig>  <cit> . the genome of this strain has been sequenced, but not assembled, so we cannot assign them to the psym, although that is their most probable localization.

the majority of the orfs shared between psfr64a and the chromosome of ngr <dig> are related to small molecule metabolism , and to the transport of small molecules . as shown in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig> this region is also highly colinear with the corresponding genes on the chromosome of ngr <dig>  data presented in this section suggest that psfr64a was assembled during evolution as a chimeric structure, harboring segments from two separate r. etli plasmids and the chromosome of a sinorhizobium strain, such as ngr <dig> 

plasmid psfr64a is transmissible and required for transfer of psfr64b
the structural conservation on psfr64a of genes involved in conjugation, raised the possibility of self-transmissibility of this replicon; therefore, the conjugative capacity of gr <dig> plasmids was studied. the results  show that plasmid psfr64a is transmissible at a high frequency. the symbiotic plasmid psfr64b was also able to perform conjugative transfer, but only when psfr64a was present. we conclude that psfr64a provides transfer functions to psfr64b. the process could be similar to what we described for cfn <dig>  where pret42a induces psym transfer by cointegration. alternatively, psfr64b mobilization could be induced in trans. interestingly, the transfer frequency of this psym was found to be two orders of magnitude higher than that of r. etli cfn <dig> psym.

a strain gmi <dig> was used as receptor. all crosses were repeated at least three times.

genomic background determines functionality of conjugative plasmids
in order to assess the specificity of psym transfer induction, we constructed derivatives containing diverse plasmid combinations, in either r. etli or s. fredii genomic backgrounds, as described in materials and methods, and determined the transfer frequency of the self-transmissible and symbiotic plasmids . analysis of a derivative containing the r. etli self-transmissible plasmid pret42a in s. fredii background  showed a dramatic decrease in the transfer ability of the plasmid as well as no transfer of the gr <dig> psym. these results suggest that the genome of gr <dig> contains an inhibitor of pret42a transfer. the decrease in pret42a transfer could mask its function as helper for psym transfer induction. the fact that pret42a transfer is also decreased in a derivative lacking the psym of gr <dig> , points to a chromosomal location of the putative inhibitor locus. similarly, s. fredii psfr64a was unable to perform conjugative transfer or induce transfer of psfr64b in r. etli genomic background . only r. etli pret42a was still able to induce psfr64b transfer in the r. etli background .

the psym of gr <dig> differs from the typical r. etli psym
to further analyze the bean-nodulating s. fredii strain gr <dig>  we performed a phylogenetic analysis with chromosomal genes , and with the plasmid-encoded genes nifh and repb. the results  show that, based on the phylogeny of the chromosomal genes, gr <dig> clusters within the fredii clade, while nifh and repb genes group strain gr <dig> with other bean-nodulating sinorhizobium strains isolated from the south of spain   <cit>  and from the north of africa   <cit>  . the data obtained indicate that gr <dig> has a s. fredii chromosome but carries a psym that allows nodulation of phaseolus. however, this plasmid differs from typical r. etli psyms in its replication genes, allowing it to coexist with plasmid psfr64a, which does share its replication genes with the r. etli psym. another feature that differentiates this psym is the presence of a single copy of the nifh gene.

discussion
genomic comparisons of s. meliloti, a. tumefaciens, and r. etli  <cit> , and between rhizobium leguminosarum bv viciae and rhizobium etli  <cit> , have shown that chromosomes are well conserved both in gene content and gene order, whereas plasmids presented few common regions and lacked synteny, except for some pairs of plasmids whose features indicate that they were part of the ancestral genome, and may be considered as secondary chromosomes  <cit> . in r. etli, the symbiotic and self-transmissible plasmids are the less conserved replicons  <cit>  with fewer collinear blocks  <cit> .

in this paper we show that a conjugative plasmid from a bean nodulating s. fredii strain is formed by large segments of replicons found in strains belonging to different species from diverse geographic origins. these replicons include two plasmids of r. etli, and a s. fredii chromosome. in gr <dig>  bean-nodulation is provided by psfr64b. although the phylogenetic relationship of the gr <dig> nifh gene shows that it is closely related to the r. etli gene , psfr64b differs from the typical r. etli psym in other features .

we have previously reported that r. etli pret42a is able to form a cointegrate with the psym, and thus promote its conjugative transfer, and that in some cases , resolution of the cointegrate leads to the generation of recombinant plasmids containing segments of both pret42a and the psym  <cit> . also, the occurrence of frequent genomic rearrangements in rhizobial species has been amply documented  <cit> .

integrating these data, we propose that the r. etli plasmids were transferred to a s. fredii strain and recombination events among the plasmids, the chromosome, and possibly another endogenous s. fredii plasmid, led to the generation of plasmids psfr64a and psfr64b. this would indicate that psfr64a is an evolutionary "new" plasmid of chimeric origin, that was generated after r. etli strains arrived to europe, following the discovery of america, when bean seeds coated with bacteria were most likely introduced to that continent  <cit> . it is noteworthy that psfr64a, in spite of carrying a large segment of chromosomal origin, would not be considered as a secondary chromosome, as it can be cured without affecting the saprophytic phenotype of the strain . it is possible that such a plasmid is an "intermediate" in the formation of secondary chromosomes. other plasmids with a structure similar to that of psfr64a, have yet to be described. the finding of such a plasmid in a natural environment may be a living example of a pathway that allows shuffling of the repabc genes, which has been proposed as a strategy to explain the plasmid diversity of rhizobium  <cit> . also, the fact that the repabc genes are located adjacent to the transfer region that is similar to that of pret42a, and separate from the other sequences that are similar to the r. etli psym, highlights the impact of evolutionary forces leading to this arrangement, which is highly conserved in many plasmids, and must have evolved in a relatively short time period.

strain ngr <dig> was isolated in  <dig> by m. j. trinick, from lablab purpureus nodules in papua new guinea  <cit> . the complete genome of strain ngr <dig> has been sequenced  <cit> . very recently, the classification of ngr <dig> was changed from rhizobium sp to sinorhizobium fredii. however, no genomic sequence of a type strain of s. fredii is available at present. genome analysis of other s. fredii strains, both, typical and bean-nodulating, would help to define if the sequence migrated to a plasmid in a s. fredii ancestor, or in a more recent event.

the segment containing sequences similar to the r. etli transmissible plasmid pret42a includes the genes involved in conjugative transfer. conjugative transfer of agrobacterium tumefaciens pti and other rhizobial plasmids is subject to quorum-sensing regulation  <cit> . in pret42a, transcription of tra and trb genes is activated by the autoinducer trai and the transcriptional regulators trar and cinr. the repressor encoded by tram is not active  <cit> . plasmid psfr64a contains similar regulatory genes, indicating that its transfer is probably regulated by quorum-sensing. some differences, such as absence of cinr may account for specific responses to different host-related or environmental conditions. preliminary data indicate the participation of new elements for the activation of the conjugative transfer of psfr64a.

a comprehensive study of the regulatory mechanisms governing psfr64a transfer will be addressed in the future.

we have shown that the psym of gr <dig> is able to perform psfr64a-dependent conjugative transfer. the process could be similar to what occurs in cfn <dig>  where pret42a forms a cointegrate with the psym, allowing its transfer. alternatively, psfr64b mobilization could be induced in trans. the analysis of this process will be pursued in the future.

r. etli plasmid p42a was defined as self-transmissible because it may be transferred from diverse genomic backgrounds, such as agrobacterium, containing no other plasmids  <cit> . the conjugation experiments performed in this work, show that pret42a transfer is significantly decreased in gr <dig> background, suggesting the presence of host-specific elements that interfere with the transfer function. regarding psfr64a, conjugation occurs at high frequency when the donor is the native strain. transfer has not been determined from plasmid-less strains, so that the lack of transfer from r. etli background could be due to the presence of an inhibitor, or to the lack of a required factor, encoded in the chromosome or psfr64b. these data suggest that a plasmid may be "sequestered" by a host, and imply that the plasmid needs to adjust the appropriate expression of conjugal transfer functions to the new host environment.

CONCLUSIONS
bean-nodulating s. fredii strain gr <dig> carries a conjugative plasmid  that has a large segment similar to the r. etli psym, including replication, but not symbiosis-related genes, another segment similar to pret42a, containing the transfer region, and a third segment, similar to the s. fredii ngr <dig> chromosome. the generation of this plasmid can be explained by the transfer of a symbiotic-conjugative-plasmid cointegrate from r. etli to a s. fredii strain; at least two recombination events among the r. etli plasmids and the s. fredii genome need to be invoked to explain the chimeric composition of plasmid psfr64a. the structure of the symbiotic plasmid of gr <dig> could also be the result of these recombination events. plasmid psfr64a is required for conjugative transfer of the symbiotic plasmid. in spite of the similarity among psfr64a and r. etli pret42a conjugation related genes, the transfer process of these plasmids shows a host-specific behaviour.
