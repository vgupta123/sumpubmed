BACKGROUND
the identification and characterization of all common sequence variants in the human genome has transformed our understanding of segregating diversity, population genetics, and disease susceptibility. snps have traditionally been thought to be the dominant source of sequence variation although other sequence variants, such as sequence duplication and deletion recognized microscopically  <cit> , were described decades ago. significant efforts have been made to document all common snps in the human genome using traditional technologies  <cit> . in the past decade, the completion of the human reference genome and development of high throughput technologies, such as microarray and next generation sequencing , have revolutionized methods for the efficient assessment of genome composition in human populations. more than  <dig> million snps have been documented based on the analysis of data from the latest technologies . however, genome surveys also revealed an unexpectedly large extent of other categories of sequence variants, including copy-number variants , inversions, translocations, and small to large sequence insertions and deletions  <cit> .

the human reference genome played a significant role in the detection of sequence variants, because it was extensively used for probe design and array generation and mapping short reads in ngs. given that we now know that sequence insertions and deletions are common, and considering that around 80% of the reference genome is derived from a single individual  <cit> , it is reasonable to expect that many common sequences, i.e. those present in at least 1% of the population, may be absent in the reference data due to missing copies in the few individuals that were studied. recently, multiple studies, using both ngs and traditional capillary sequencing, have reported novel sequences that are absent in the reference genome, but are present in at least a few individuals . for example, using capillary sequencing technology, a recent study identified more than  <dig>  novel sequences  in the genomes of nine individuals  <cit> . many of these appear in more than one individual, implying that these sequences may be common in human populations. furthermore, de novo assembly of several individual genomes that were deeply sequenced using ngs also revealed novel sequences  <cit> . based on these findings, the amount of novel sequences that are not present in the reference genome was estimated to be around 20–40 mb for each individual  <cit> . comprehensive discovery of all common sequences that are absent in the reference genome would require sequencing of a large number of individual genomes that are representative of the human population. currently, neither capillary sequencing nor deep sequencing using ngs are suitable for these purposes, since they require either intensive labor or the cost is still prohibitive for deep sequencing of a large number of individuals.

we have developed a method to identify novel sequences in individuals using one end anchor  reads from paired-end sequencing where one end of the pair can be uniquely mapped to the reference genome  while the other cannot be mapped at all   <cit> . a similar method was developed for the detection of virus sequences  <cit> . we extend this strategy by pooling shallow sequencing data  from a large number of individuals to systematically identify sequences common in the human population that are absent in the reference genome. for this purpose, we applied this method on genomic data from hundreds of individuals generated from phase  <dig> of the  <dig> genomes project  <cit> . our pipeline identifies micseqs by pooling orphan reads from  <dig> individuals of african, asian, and european origin followed by de novo assembly of these orphan reads to generate candidate micseqs. we used various strategies to filter out false micseqs, and systematically validated the remaining micseqs through comparative genomic analysis. direct experimental examination of randomly selected fifteen micseqs on  <dig> additional samples confirmed that all fifteen micseqs were present in at least one individual. additional analysis suggested many micseqs are functional genomic elements involved in biological functions.

RESULTS
identification of micseq by pooling samples from 1 k genome project
our pipeline to detect micseqs, contains four steps : 1) data collection and quality control; 2) identification of one end anchor reads  and de novo assembly of micseqs using pooled oea reads from  <dig> individuals. pooling permits the use of shallow sequence data and the identification of common sequences is dependent on a stringent coverage cutoff for de novo assembly, in this case at least 50× coverage; 3) identification and filtering of false micseqs based on the genomic location of anchor reads corresponding to the orphan reads that are assembled together ; 4) validation of filtered micseqs via comparative genomic analysis on a database of vertebrate genomes, comparison to the deeply sequenced genomes of four individuals, and comparison to rna-seq data, as well as direct experimental examination of micseqs.figure  <dig>

one end anchor reads. due to the limited insert size, orphan reads are in the neighborhood of anchor reads in paired end sequencing, thus, the location of anchor reads can be used to filter out the false sequences and estimate the location of true sequences. note that full orphan reads could be used to help detect longer insertion sequences. a) illustration of oea reads. b) the anchor reads corresponding to one micseq candidate are distributed along the chromosome with very modest coherence in one location, it is very likely this is a false micseq. candidate micsqs of this type  are filtered out; c) the anchor reads are highly clustered in one short region, these are brought forward for validation analysis.



the pipeline was applied to paired-end sequencing data for  <dig> individuals of african , asian  and european  origin obtained from the phase  <dig> release of the 1 k genomes project. we identified  <dig> micseqs with a length of at least 100 bp. in total, the  <dig> micseqs contained  <dig>  bp . the longest micseq had  <dig>  bp and the mean length is 221 bp . over 70% of individual micseqs are present in at least 5% of the population studied , and on average each individual has  <dig> micseqs  comprised of 5kb or more sequences that are absent in reference genome. we investigated the location of micseqs in chromosomes based on their anchor position, and found that these micseqs are relatively uniformly distributed across the genome .figure  <dig>

previous methods have used one end anchor  and orphan reads to identify novel sequences present in individuals using deep sequenced genomes  <cit> . in contrast to these studies that focus on individual genomes, we here focus on the population by deriving strength from pooled reads, i.e., our objective is to identify sequences that are novel and relatively common in human populations. currently, the number of deep-sequenced genomes is still limited. to take advantage of availability of large number of shallow-sequenced genomes, we pooled oea reads from different individuals to identify micseqs. the pooled nature of the reads we utilized also requires methodological improvements as compared to existing methods. namely, since the number of pooled reads is very large, our method utilizes the position of the corresponding anchor reads to improve computational efficiency by filtering out false sequences . the location information is also valuable for further annotation and validation using sanger sequencing, for example, for primer design. finally, our results further contribute to the literature by validating and investigating the conservation and evolution of the identified sequences using comparative genomics approach, as described below.

validation of micseq by comparative genomics and sanger sequencing on additional samples
comparison of micseqs with genome sequences from additional individuals provides validation for many micseqs, while comparison with genomes from other vertebrate species can evaluate whether they are conserved during evolution. we compared the micseqs with genome sequences from four individuals , particularly focusing on the sequences that cannot be mapped to the reference  <cit> . three micseqs  are present in all four individuals, while  <dig> micseqs were found to be present in at least one of the four. more micseqs  were detected in j. craig venter’s genome compared to other individual genomes . venter’s genome was sequenced using capillary sequencing  <cit> , previous studies have indicated that novel sequences were often partially sequenced or were missing altogether in genomes sequenced using ngs technologies  <cit> . seven of the micseqs had high sequence similarity with novel insertions previously detected in nine individuals  <cit> . this modest overlap suggests that the previous study identified many novel sequences that are more rare than those identified here. when compared with genomes from other vertebrates, none of the micseqs had homologs in genomes other than those of primates . we were able to find potential homologs for 45% of micseqs  in at least one primate with sequence similarity higher than 90%.  <dig> micseqs had homologs in at least three primates, indicating that they are conserved during evolution and may have functional roles. data for micseq <dig>  including the homologs in primates, the population distribution, predicted and validated sequences , are shown in figure  <dig>  the conservation of micseqs in multiple primate species provides an opportunity to locate their exact position in the human genome at the resolution of single nucleotide . for micseqs without homologs in other species, the location of corresponding anchor reads can provide reliable position information with 1kb resolution . the estimated locations can be found at the online database: http://proteomics.case.edu/micseqdb.table  <dig> 
number of micseq homologs in other primates


none of  <dig> micseqs has homolog other than primates. in contrast,  <dig> micseqs have at least one homolog in other primates. note that the number of homolog in one primate agrees with the distance to human, i.e., more homolog present in species close to human.

among  <dig> micseqs conserved in primates, fifteen micseqs were randomly selected for experimental validation using pcr on an additional  <dig> samples from individuals with african , asian  and european  ancestry. the primers used can be found in  along with the targeted micseqs. the pcr and sequences for micseq <dig> were shown in figure  <dig>  which clearly shows the presence of micseq <dig> in most of african individuals while it is absent in the other populations. furthermore, the dna sequences from sanger sequencing confirms our prediction for micseq <dig> in terms of both its sequence and position. we also selected a few bands that don’t contain micseqs  for sanger sequencing to verify the absence of micseqs. one example was included in . all  <dig> micseqs were detected in at least one individual, i.e., bands of appropriate size are observed in dna blots . nine out of  <dig> micseqs showed extensive population stratification with a significantly higher allele frequency in african vs. non-african individuals, consistent with previous studies  <cit> . the micseq frequencies in different populations estimated from 1 k genome data follow similar trends.table  <dig>

the sample sizes are  <dig> for the european group,  <dig> for the african group, and  <dig> for the asian group. for each micseq, frequency in italic font indicates the maximum frequency.  <dig> out of  <dig> micseqs show higher frequency in the african population than the other populations;  <dig> of them are statistically significant at the 5% level as indicated by bold font.



in summary,  <dig> micseqs out of  <dig> that were identified  were supported by independent evidence for their presence in humans. the independent evidence included detection in individual genomes, existence of homologs in other primate genomes, or support from expression arrays in human brain tissue , as summarized in figure  <dig>  all of  <dig> selected micseqs have been confirmed using pcr experiments in  <dig> additional individuals from africa, asia and europe.figure  <dig> 
venn diagram of micseq validation analyses. the overlap of micseqs observed be homologous to primate sequences, and in high coverage data from four individual genomes, and in mrna expression data of human brain samples. in total,  <dig> micseqs or 76% have independent evidence for their presence in human genome sequences.



some micseqs are highly expressed in human brain
potential gene associations of micseqs were established by comparing their genomic locations derived from the anchor reads with those of genes obtained from refseq database. the results are summarized in figure 1e;  <dig> micseqs locate in intergenic region  while  <dig> are seen in the utr or intron regions of refseq genes. only one micseq locates in the coding region . the refseq genes associated with micseq can be found in the online database .

the complete transcriptome of the human brain contributed to our understanding of the development and function of different brain regions and functional circuits. we further investigated whether the identified micseqs were expressed in the brain. for this purpose, we collected and analyzed  <dig> rna-seq data sets of samples from various brain regions .  <dig> micseqs have more than  <dig> reads in individual samples, suggesting that they are relatively highly expressed. for example, in each of six samples , there are more than  <dig> reads mapped to micseq <dig>  three of which are shown in figure 6a. note that several positions show differences between assembled reads with micseq3; the reason might be snp or rna editing since editing events are prevalent in the brain  <cit> . the read depths were up to  <dig> in one sample . we further identified one est sequence from brain in dbest  that has significant high similarity with micseq <dig> , which further confirms the existence and expression of micseq <dig>  micseq <dig> has a length of 265 nt, and is located in the 3′utr of gene pabpc <dig> , which codes a poly  binding protein. the rate of expression of this micseq in some individuals suggests that it might have a regulatory function or help to code an alternative exon for pabpc <dig>  moreover, micseq <dig> has homologous sequences with high sequence similarity identified in four other primates: chimpanzee , gorilla , orangutan  and gibbon , providing further evidence for its importance . however, further detailed analysis are needed to determine the exact function: e.g. if they are missing exons or noncoding rnas, and if these micseqs are expressed in other tissues or are brain specific.figure  <dig> 
example of expressed micseqs detected from rna-seq data. a) reads aligned to micseq <dig>  note that the reads depth can be up to more than  <dig>  indicting it is moderately expressed. the color columns indicate that the reads have different nucleotides with micseq <dig> probably because of snps or rna editing. b) homologs of micseqs with high sequence similarity can be identified in other primates.



three micseqs containing tf-binding regions
recently, the encode project published a series of comprehensive studies to uncover the functional elements in the human genome, including analysis of chip-seq data for  <dig> transcription factors  in  <dig> cell types  <cit> . to investigate if the identified micseqs contain tf-binding regions we analyzed the whole chip-seq data set from the encode project . our analysis provided strong evidence that three micseqs  are likely to bind to tfs, such as pol <dig>  stat <dig>  foxa <dig>  the detailed results can be found in supplemental material including the number of reads mapped to micseqs, the tfs and sra ids. figure  <dig> shows that more than  <dig> reads from three chip-seq datasets were mapped to micseq <dig>  and the highest coverage was 61×. however, as mentioned above, due to the stringent criteria to assemble micseqs  and lower coverage of ngs data from the 1 k genome project, most of micseqs are short , and are likely to be only part of longer sequences in humans. the chip-seq reads cluster in the end of micseq <dig> , suggesting the possibility that micseq <dig> contains only part of the tf-binding region.figure  <dig> 
tf binding region in micseq <dig>  reads from chip-seq can be mapped to part of micseq <dig>  indicating micseq <dig> contains tf binding region. reads from three chip-seq experiments are showed in this figure. note that micseq <dig> might have only part of tf binding region due to the high cutoff threshold .



due to potential concerns of sequencing bias in chip-seq experiments, comparison with appropriate control data  is critical to filter out false binding sites. for each of micseq <dig>  micseq <dig>  and micseq <dig>  there were very limited reads from control experiments that could be mapped to them - less than  <dig> reads in the vast majority of samples . for example, in the case of micseq <dig>  on average,  <dig> reads map to chip-seq experiments for  <dig> tfs on hela-s <dig> cells, compared with only  <dig> reads to the  <dig> control samples. both micseq <dig> and micseq <dig> are located in the neighborhood of noncoding rnas; micseq <dig> is  <dig>  kb away from one lincrna, ac <dig> , while mirna1268a is very close to micseq <dig> . these micseqs might regulate expression of these noncoding rnas through tf-binding. moreover, these micseqs occur at a high frequency in the population; more than half of  <dig> individuals contribute at least one read to assemble them, and one third contribute at least two reads, implying that their deletion in the reference genome could be considered a rare variant.

comparison with the latest reference genome
in december  <dig>   <dig>  the genome reference consortium announced the public release of grch <dig>  the latest version of the human reference genome assembly, and phase  <dig> of  <dig> genomes project used a combination of reference grch <dig>  and unlocalized and unplaced contigs as reference genome. we searched our sequences against these two latest versions of the reference genome for micseqs. sequences with more than 95% similarity were detected for  <dig> micseqs for grch <dig> and  <dig> for the reference used by the  <dig> genomes project, which further validates our approach. these results also suggest that the remaining micseqs are good candidates for inclusion in future releases of the reference human genome.

discussion
a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variants, including snps, indels, cnvs, and common and rare variants is an essential resource for researchers attempting to identify variants that affect phenotypic traits, complex genetic diseases, and responses to drugs and environmental factors. several large-scale projects, such as hapmap and 1 k genome project  <cit> , have made significant progress toward documentation of all common variants in several human populations, and laid the basis for the success of current generation of genome wide association studies   <cit> . although the ‘common variant- common diseases’ hypothesis was not confirmed by gwas  <cit> , and the basis of the so-called ‘missing heritability’ problem is still not well understood  <cit> , many common variants with small effects and many rare variants with large effects need to be identified and investigated  <cit> .

micseq is a special form of an indel, in that these sequences are absent in the reference genome. detecting intermediate length to large indels  is challenging with the current high-throughput technologies, and sequences absent in the reference genome are not targeted in virtually all genotyping projects  <cit> . de novo assembly of individual genomes followed by comparison with the reference sequence was a key method used to discover such sequences. as noted, previous analyses of individual genomes deeply sequenced using ngs have identified nucleotide patterns present in specific individuals but absent in the reference genome . however, this approach is still prohibitive as a method to identify common variants due to the high cost for deep sequencing of many individuals and assembling a large number of short reads. our approach takes advantage of one end anchor reads from paired end reads, and assembles micseqs by pooling orphan reads of lower coverage ngs data  from a large number of individuals. validation by comparative genomics and pcr experiments on additional samples demonstrate that our method is accurate and effective in detecting micseqs. however, the high-coverage threshold used in the de novo assembly of step  <dig>  limits the detected micseqs to commonly observed sequences instead of rare ones present in only a few individuals. this cutoff could be adjusted based on the number of individuals and the depth of sequencing to identify fewer highly common variants or a greater number of rare variants. it should also be noted that the resulting micseqs assembled by our method could be part of the true consensus sequence, and a large number of micseqs in the population remain to be discovered, due to the relatively low coverage of ngs data and only  <dig> individuals from three populations used in this study.

the origin and evolution of micseqs in humans can be estimated using a parsimony approach along with the time point of deletion in the ancestors of a sub-population and/or identification of periods that new sequences emerged. none of the  <dig> micseqs reported here have homologs beyond primates, indicating that they are relatively young in the human genome and common ancestors of primates first acquired those sequences in their genomes. it is also interesting to note that the number of micseqs in each primate agrees precisely with the evolutionary distance with humans , suggesting that micseqs were acquired gradually over long time intervals. possible mechanisms to acquire new sequences include duplication followed by dramatic changes, admixture with other closely related species, and horizontal sequence transfer from other species. duplication is a major evolutionary event occurring across the genome sequence, and contributes significantly to shape and refactor the functionalities of the organism  <cit> . however, duplication may not be a mechanism relevant to micseqs since no paralogous sequences can be detected in human and other primates. horizontal dna sequence transfer, particularly through retroviral infection  <cit> , is the process by which an organism incorporates dna sequence from evolutionarily unrelated organism. this phenomenon is well documented in evolution of bacterial and parasitic unicellular eukaryotes  <cit> . recent studies show strong evidence of transfer of dna to higher eukaryotes, such as drosophila, wheel animals and even rodents . however, it is still not clear if horizontal transfer can occur in primates. recent analyses of neandertal and archaic hominid genomes show that up to 6% percent of their genomes can contribute to genomes of one human population , suggesting at least two admixture events in the course of human evolution. thus, the micseqs possibly resulted from the admixture of other closely related extinct species.

in our data  <dig> micseqs  have either homologs in other primates or are present in african populations. thus, absence of the majority of micseqs in part of the global human population are due to deletions in recent human evolution, since strong evidence supports the origin of modern humans occurred in a relatively restricted geographic distribution in east africa. thirty three of  <dig> have homologs in other primates, but are absent in africans, suggesting in a complementary fashion that they were deleted in african populations. fifty six micseqs have no homolog in primates and are absent in african populations; one possible mechanism to explain this finding is the acquisition of new sequences by ancestors of contemporary populations after their migration from africa.

CONCLUSIONS
this work presented here builds on previous several technological and analytic advances, beginning with ngs data or sanger sequencing from cloned dna, to identify novel sequence variants in individual genomes  <cit> . the unique features of this study that have relevance for other data sets include: pooling of orphan reads from many individuals’ ngs data to identify novel common sequences, where the frequency with which the sequence is identified depends on the number of individuals pooled and the depth of sequencing for each individual; and examination of the concordance statistics of the mapping locations provided by the anchor end of the oea reads to filter out false micseqs across the population of individuals and/or reads . clearly this approach could be an effective means of identifying insertions of novel sequences related to human disease by examining pooled ngs data from affected individuals, including tumors or other tissue-specific genomes. however, due to limitations in the assembly of short reads, we may have identified only parts of longer insertions. assembling the full orphan reads and linking ends to the existing micseqs could identify additional sequences. thus both the orphan reads from oea and/or full orphan reads could be used to identify novel insertions where techniques such as mapping to primate sequences, examination of individual genomes, comparison to rna-seq data, or pcr and sequencing are used to validate predicted novel insertions. the identification of over  <dig> sequences - at least  <dig> per individual - will be a new focus for future functional analyses.
