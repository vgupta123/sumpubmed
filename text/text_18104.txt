BACKGROUND
the gossypium genus is composed of approximately  <dig> species including four cultivated ones which vary in morphological and economic characteristics considerably  <cit> . species which possess superior fiber and yield traits are tetraploids, gossypium hirsutum and g. barbadense. g. hirsutum, also called upland cotton, is grown in warm climates worldwide, and possesses high lint yield which is vital to the textile industry. g. barbadense, also called egyptian cotton, pima cotton, or sea-island cotton, is known for superior fiber length, strength, and fineness  <cit> . both species have been the focus of breeding programs to combine their superior fiber quantity and quality traits  <cit>  since the rediscovery of mendelian genetics more than a century ago.

in cotton and other crop species quantitative traits are governed by a multitude of loci each of which contributes to a particular phenotype in varying degrees  <cit> . these loci are called quantitative trait loci  and are evaluated for their positions on the chromosomes, and the phenotypic variance that they contribute to a particular trait  <cit> . studies in gossypium have focused on qtl which are involved in fiber strength, length, uniformity, micronaire, color, disease resistance, fruiting nodes, boll weight and number, yield, seed oil and protein content, leaf morphology, and various seed related traits  <cit> . numerous independent studies have reported qtl pertaining to all of these traits using independent or updated linkage maps from different or the same segregating populations.

historically qtl mapping studies were expensive undertakings that may have yielded little to no results. creation of sufficient markers to saturate the genome was expensive with no guarantee that the markers generated would be anywhere close to the qtl of interest  <cit> . marker development has improved significantly and has become much less expensive  <cit> . mapping strategies have also progressed from simple interval mapping  to more complex composite interval mapping , multiple qtl mapping , and others which greatly increase the accuracy of placing qtl  <cit> . this study uses a mixture of more advanced mapping techniques including cim and mqm.

qtl mapping is an important tool for breeders to combine economically important traits together to create a superior cultivar. crosses between g. barbadense and g. hirsutum have been attempted for decades to combine their superior fiber quality and yield traits. while the two species are genetically close enough to be crossed there are issues with sterility, cytological abnormalities, and distorted segregation  <cit> . differences in mapping populations, genotypes, and environments can yield heterogeneous results in qtl mapping  <cit> . for this reason, meta-analysis is useful in marker assisted selection as it merges datasets and creates consensus map positions for qtl. not only does meta-analysis help to confirm the existence of declared qtl from various studies by creating possible hotspots where qtl from the same trait aggregate but it can imply the existence of pleotropic traits by creating qtl clusters for various traits.

previous qtl mapping studies,  <dig> of which were cumulatively used in this study are summarized in table  <dig> <cit> . fiber quality traits which are of upmost importance to cotton breeding programs have dominated these studies in gossypium compared to yield and disease resistance related traits  <cit> . for this reason, the majority of the qtl in this study are fiber quality related qtl. studies done thus far have varied in linkage groups used, mapping techniques, gossypium species, mapping populations, and markers. it is important to consolidate all of the studies into a consensus map to identify possible qtl clusters and hotspots.

two large scale meta-analyses of gossypium were conducted by rong et al.  <cit>  and lacape et al.  <cit> . the study by lacape et al. focused on fiber quality traits, while rong et al.  <cit>  study was more comprehensive where the traits included fiber and seed, quality, drought tolerance to leaf morphology, and bacterial blight  resistance. lacape et al.’s  <cit>  study on fiber quality was based on a g. barbadense x g. hirsutum  recombinant inbred line  population, whereas rong et al.’s study pooled qtl from a multitude of segregating populations  tested in a single environment with no replicates. the study by rong et al.  <cit>  pooled a variety of qtl trait types but lacked sufficient qtl from any one trait to declare hotspots. since rong et al.’s  <cit>  work in  <dig>  many new yields and resistance related qtl have been described by numerous publications, not included in lacape et al’s  <cit>  work. this study combines the work from the two meta-qtl studies and numerous other recent publications to perform a meta-analysis based on  <dig> different studies using a total of  <dig>  qtl. furthermore, some declared clusters in rong et al.’s  <cit>  study consisted of only two qtl, whereas clusters in this study required four or more qtl to declare a cluster. placing more stringent requirements on what constitutes a cluster decreases the chances of declaring a false positive cluster. also with the addition of newly discovered qtl declaring clusters with so few qtl would place a cluster on nearly every segment of every chromosome. in this study, the majority of clusters contains far more than four qtl and signifies a heavily populated region of qtl on the chromosome. with the addition of new qtl previously not described by meta-analysis, many hotspot clusters were identified in this study which were previously unknown. this study provides a comprehensive and updated meta-analysis of gossypium.

distribution of clusters and hotspots were further compared between respective homoelogous chromosomes from the a and d subgenomes. eight homologous chromosome pairs, i.e., c <dig> and c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  and c <dig> and c <dig> did not share any remarkable similarities in their number or placement of clusters or hotspots. two homoelogous chromosome pairs c <dig> and c <dig>  and c <dig> and c <dig>  both carried clusters at the same region . the c <dig> and c <dig> pair each also carried a hotspot but they were of different trait types. interestingly, three homoelogous chromosome pairs c <dig> and c <dig> at 0-20cm, c <dig> and c <dig>  and c <dig> and c <dig> at 25-45cm, both contained or shared a micronaire hotspot at similar regions . chromosomes c <dig> and c <dig> each also carried a color hotspot while c <dig> and c <dig> each had a fiber length hotspot; however, the hotspots did not coincide on similar regions of the homeologous chromosomes. therefore, overall, the  <dig> pairs of homeologous chromosomes from the a and d subgenomes do not have remarkable similarities of qtl clusters or hotspots in number or placement on the genome.

chromosomes containing two or more qtl hotspots always contained at least  <dig> different trait qtl hotspot types. all hotspots overlapped with clusters in the same region. some chromosomes containing more than one hotspot contained regions where hotspots overlapped forming hotspot clusters. for example, chromosome c <dig> contained an overlap between a fl and a micronaire qtl hotspot. chromosome c <dig> contained an overlapping fiber color qtl hotspot and a micronaire qtl hotspot. chromosome c <dig> contained an overlap between a fs, nematode resistance, and a fl qtl hotspot. chromosome c <dig> contained an overlapping fu and micronaire qtl hotspots. notably, chromosome c <dig> contained a fe, leaf morphology, and a micronaire qtl hotspot, all of which overlapped in the same region. chromosome c <dig> contained an overlap between a vw resistance qtl hotspot and a micronaire qtl hotspot. chromosome c <dig> contained two overlapping qtl hotspots for fe and vw resistance. chromosome c <dig> contained an fs and a micronaire qtl hotspot which overlapped forming a fiber quality hotspot cluster. chromosome c <dig> contained a fiber color and a micronaire qtl hotspot which overlapped forming another fiber quality hotspot cluster.

discussion
the  <dig>  qtl distributed over the gossypium genome in this study revealed the presence of qtl clusters and specific trait qtl hotspots. certain regions of the cotton chromosomes were more densely populated with qtl than other regions, implying the existence of qtl clusters. hotspots for fiber quality, verticillium resistance, nematode related resistance and leaf morphology were identified. regions which contained clusters often contained hotspots, and in some cases hotspots overlapped. this data could potentially be used to identify new qtl in defined regions by clusters rather than attempting to scan the entire genome for qtl.

the significance of this study is the discovery of qtl clusters and hotspots, and reaffirmation of previous meta-analysis studies, which are of immediate value to breeders. the comprehensive cluster and hotspot map produced in this study will allow breeding programs to focus their efforts on regions of the genome containing the most qtl of interest. in addition, breeding programs may utilize the confidence interval data to only focus on qtl within narrow regions of the genome, as opposed to qtl containing broad confidence intervals. hotspot clusters containing two or more hotspots will be of immediate interest to breeding programs as they contain multiple qtl of interest. in addition, this study is a much needed update of previous meta-analysis studies in gossypium that is less comprehensive and up to date  <cit> . previous meta-analyses have shown that qtl overlap to form clusters and that certain regions of the genome contain more qtl than others  <cit> . therefore it is possible that novel qtl may be found within the clusters identified by this study.

in this study, data was collected from  <dig> different publications using a variety of population types , gossypium species, environments, and qtl traits. each study varied in their reporting of qtl in terms of confidence intervals used and lod scores at which qtl were declared. the biomercator v <dig> software requires confidence intervals  in the qtl report; however, some publications did not include them. for those publications ci were estimated based on flanking marker positions of the qtl placed on the chromosome. only qtl with current markers found in the cotton marker database and did not have multiple locations on a linkage groups were used in this study. when exact qtl positions were unknown and only flanking markers positions were given the average distance between markers was used to place the qtl on the chromosome. also when exact confidence intervals were not provided, the flaking marker positions were used as confidence intervals. each publication varied in terms of the average length of ci with some being significantly longer than others. the identification of clusters and hotspots are more problematic using qtl with wide ci. not all qtl from every study was included in the analysis for the reasons described above to preserve accuracy in the study. some studies identified qtl on a and d linkage groups and used flanking markers which did not coincide with markers known based on the cotton marker database . for those qtl it was not possible to place them on the consensus map and they were therefore excluded from the study. qtl which were outside the range of the consensus map provided by the cmd were excluded from the study. clusters were estimated within regions of approximately 20cm allowing for the possibility of qtl with wide confidence intervals to be possibly placed anywhere in that region. the biomercator v <dig> software  <cit>  also required lod scores and r^ <dig>  values for all qtl in the study. both the lod scores and r^ <dig> values varied wildly between studies; however, this data was irrelevant to the qtl placement on the chromosomes. qtl placement and inference of clusters were based only on the physical placement of the qtl in genetic distance  given by each study, and the ci which was estimated by flanking markers if not given in the study.

the majority of the qtl data in this analysis was taken from fiber quality qtl analysis and not studies pertaining to yield traits or resistance qtl to biotic and abiotic stresses. thus, the large qtl meta-analysis studies done in gossypium have focused only on fiber quality traits  <cit> . this study pools together not only large scale fiber quality qtl studies but also yield, seed quality, leaf morphology, and resistance studies. the majority of hotspots were fiber quality related; however, five resistance, and one leaf morphology hotspot were identified. the existence of hotspots pertaining to multiple traits coexisting in the same region of a chromosome or hotspot clusters is beneficial to breeders, and some have been identified in this study. the impact of this study is the identification of fiber quality, yield, seed, leaf morphology, and resistance hotspots, and clusters containing various mixtures of all traits. the identification of clusters and hotspots will be useful in marker-assisted selection since the markers delineating these regions can be chosen for selecting the traits of interests in cotton breeding. for example, many of the qtl hotspots identified in this study contained hotspot cluster regions containing two or more hotspots pertaining to different traits. in this study, such regions often pertained to fiber quality related qtl hotspots. breeding programs focused on fiber quality traits can focus on hotspot clustering regions and select for the flanking markers around the region. most of the qtl clusters had hotspots associated with them, indicating that if new qtl are to be discovered they may be found around regions of known clusters. marker assisted selection programs can utilize clusters found in this study to find novel qtl and possibly novel hotspots within the regions. this study identified regions of importance to marker assisted breeding programs with clusters and hotspots, and identified chromosomes which have the most qtl, clusters, and hotspots for future breeding programs.

to make the results publicly accessible, a database will be established. updates will be also made regularly when new studies have been published. users can access the information based on their needs or interests per trait or chromosome.

CONCLUSIONS
qtl clusters and hotspots were inferred and identified using the positions and distribution of qtl along the gossypium genome. the presence of qtl clusters and hotspots indicate that genes pertaining to certain traits are more heavily concentrated in certain regions of the genome than others. since multiple gossypium species were used in the various publications it confirms that qtl clusters and hotspots are consistent throughout the genus. the study found clusters on every chromosome, but hotspots pertaining to specific traits are present only on some chromosomes. the locations of these clusters and hotspots will be beneficial for marker assisted selection and breeding programs focused on fiber quality, seed quality, disease resistance, leaf morphology, and other yield related traits. fiber quality hotspots dominated this study, but five disease resistance hotspots, four pest resistance hotspots, and one leaf morphology hotspot were detected. the chromosomal locations of these clusters can be used as a starting point to identify new qtl using consensus marker and meta-analysis data. this may be useful for future qtl analysis to map regions of the genome with high phenotypic impact for various traits. to date this is the most comprehensive qtl meta-analysis study done with gossypium as it utilizes past meta-analyses and current publications to identify novel clusters and hotspots previously not described.
