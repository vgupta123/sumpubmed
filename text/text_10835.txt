BACKGROUND
malaria is a disease affecting millions of people worldwide. cerebral malaria  is one of the most severe complications and is a major cause of death. both host and parasite genetic factors play important roles in the outcome of malaria infection. epidemiological data, candidate gene studies, and genetic linkage studies clearly support the existence of a genetic contribution to susceptibility to human malaria  <cit> . in parallel with human studies, malaria susceptibility genes have been mapped in mouse models, and the role of some genes has been demonstrated  <cit> . it is clear, however, that a number of malaria susceptibility genes remain to be identified. these include genes, whose expression is likely deregulated upon malaria infection.

transcriptional profiling may provide new tools for identifying the key genes that govern host responses against pathogens. recently, several reports have described gene expression changes that accompany the host response against plasmodium spp. microarrays have been analyzed from mice  <cit> , rhesus monkey  <cit>  and humans  <cit> , upon infection by plasmodium spp a parallel can be observed in the regulation of genes involved in immune responses, glycolysis, and erythropoiesis. these data suggested that variation in host gene expression may be associated with resistance or susceptibility to malaria.

recently, we investigated brain gene expression patterns in well-defined genetically cm-resistant  and cm-susceptible mice  by use of cdna microarrray  <cit> . we identified a set of genes that perfectly discriminates between cm-r and cm-s mice at the time of cm onset. this indicates that gene expression analysis using microarray tools may be useful for the identification of candidate genes that are potentially responsible for resistance or susceptibility to cm. nevertheless, an important issue was to identify genes whose expression differ between cm-r and cm-s mice before the time of cm onset to identify early events that may participate in malaria pathogenesis. in this report, we present an analysis of genes differentially expressed in brains from cm-r and cm-s mice prior to infection, and at the early and late stages of infection with plasmodium berghei anka . data analysis reveals that molecules belonging to several biological processes were preferentially and differentially expressed between cm-r and cm-s mice, and that a number of gene expression changes occurred at the early and late stages of infection. herein, we discuss new working hypotheses on this basis.

RESULTS
identification of genes regulated in brains by pba infection
the anova of microarray data revealed significant gene expression changes over the course of infection in balb/c  mice, cba/j mice , and in c57bl/ <dig> mice . we calculated empirical p values for each gene, and we considered p <  <dig>  significant. on this basis, we selected  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes for balb/c mice, cba/j mice, and c57bl/ <dig> mice, respectively.

to further compare uninfected mice with infected mice, we performed a welch t test and we applied a bonferroni correction to account for multiple tests performed . figure  <dig> shows the number of genes whose expression was significantly altered by pba infection. the mouse strains displayed various patterns. strikingly, the number of genes that showed significant expression changes was higher in c57bl/ <dig> mice than in cba/j mice on day  <dig> post-infection with pba . the number of genes that showed significant expression changes in cba/j mice gradually increased during infection. in contrast, the number of genes that showed significant expression changes in both c57bl/ <dig> mice and balb/c mice on day  <dig> was similar to the number of genes identified on day 7; it was, nevertheless, lower on day  <dig> than on days  <dig> and  <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  most of the genes identified in c57bl/ <dig> mice  and in cba/j mice  were under-expressed, while most of the genes identified in balb/c mice  were over-expressed.

a venn diagram summarizes the number of overlapping genes with significant differential expression at different time points . most of the genes identified on day  <dig> were no longer identified on day  <dig> in c57bl/ <dig> mice and in balb/c mice. as shown in figure 3a–b and 3e–f,  <dig> of  <dig> and  <dig> of  <dig> genes with differential expression on day  <dig> did not show differential expression on days  <dig> and  <dig> in c57bl/ <dig> and balb/c mice, respectively. in contrast,  <dig> of  <dig> genes regulated by pba infection on day  <dig> were also regulated on days  <dig> and  <dig> in cba/j mice , indicating that c57bl/ <dig> mice and cba/j mice partly differ in their transcriptional response over the course of infection.

microarray analysis discriminates between cm-r and cm-s mice according to the time after infection
we searched for genes showing differential expression between mouse strains before infection. the anova identified  <dig> genes without multiple test correction , and  <dig> genes with bonferroni multiple test correction at the level of 5%: 1700023b02rik, acot <dig>  gpd <dig>  sec11c, ngly <dig>  zfp <dig> and tln <dig>  these results revealed a minor natural variation in gene expression between mouse strains. nevertheless, we took into account this natural variation in further analyses to search for transcriptional changes. thus, the individual gene expression level in infected mice was adjusted for the gene expression level in uninfected mice for each mouse strain.

to focus on transcriptional changes associated with resistance or susceptibility, we searched for a set of genes that discriminated between cm-r mice  and cm-s mice . to this end, we used the multi-class significant analysis of microarrays  procedure, and we applied a false discovery rate of 0% . the analysis yielded a set of  <dig> genes , which was used to perform unsupervised hierarchical clustering . interestingly, the expression of several genes was induced in cm-r mice or suppressed in cm-s mice as a result of infection, while the expression of other genes was suppressed in cm-r mice and induced in cm-s mice . this led to successfully classify cm-r and cm-s mice according to the time after infection  and to determine five clusters . clusters a and c fully grouped cm-r mice  versus cm-s mice  whatever the time after infection. genes of cluster a were over-expressed in cm-s mice compared to cm-r mice, while genes of cluster c were under-expressed in cm-s mice compared to cm-r mice. clusters b and d also grouped cm-r mice versus cm-s mice. nevertheless, clusters b and d discriminated between c57bl/ <dig> and cba/j mice, indicating differential gene expression between the two cm-s strains at early time points of infection. genes of clusters b and d were over-expressed in cba/j mice on day  <dig> post-infection compared to c57bl/ <dig> mice, and in c57bl/ <dig> on days  <dig> and  <dig> post-infection compared to cba/j mice, respectively. at late stage of infection, genes of clusters b and d showed similar gene expression between the two cm-s strains, and were under-expressed in cm-s mice compared to cm-r mice. cluster e discriminated mice at early and late stage of infection. nevertheless, genes of cluster e were over-expressed in cm-s mice compared to cm-r mice indicating an interval between the response of cm-s and the response of cm-r mice.

to analyze functional annotations related to cm, we sought biological process gene ontology  terms and kegg pathways for the  <dig> genes that discriminated between cm-r mice  and cm-s mice . the analysis of biological process go terms of gene clusters showed an over-representation of some go terms. in particular, the go terms related to the "defense response" category, such as the "immune response" or the "inflammatory response" go terms were strongly over-represented in cluster e . similarly, most of the genes grouped in cluster e were found to be involved in kegg pathways related to immune responses, such as "cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction" or "natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity". the analysis of other clusters did not reveal, however, a strong over-representation of particular go terms, suggesting that these clusters were heterogeneous. in particular, clusters b and c contained  <dig> and  <dig> genes with heterogeneous go categories. this was further supported by the analysis of kegg pathways, which pointed out a number of different pathways, such as metabolic energy pathways , immune responses , haematopoiesis, , cytoskeleton pathways , or pathways related to brain function  .

a this set of genes was extracted from the full data set  by use of a sam procedure and a false discovery rate of 0%.

we specifically searched for genes with significant differential expression between cm-r and cm-s mice. thus, we used the welch t test to compare balb/c mice  on the one hand and cba/j mice and c57bl/ <dig> mice  on the other hand . we tested the  <dig> genes identified by the sam multi-class procedure, but we considered the whole data set  to carry out multiple testing correction. among the  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes were further found to be differentially expressed between cm-r mice and cm-s mice . among the  <dig> genes,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes showed significant differential expression on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were grouped in clusters a, b, c and e, respectively. the number of co-occurring genes with differential expression between cm-r and cm-s mice detected at different times is displayed in figure  <dig>  eighteen of  <dig> genes were up-regulated in cm-s mice compared to cm-r mice, while  <dig> of  <dig> genes were up-regulated in cm-r mice compared to cm-s mice. only one gene showed a complicated picture: fyco <dig> was down-regulated in cba/j and c57bl/ <dig> mice  mice on day  <dig>  and in cba/j mice on day  <dig>  while it was up-regulated in c57bl/ <dig> mice on day  <dig>  table  <dig> show the most represented kegg pathways, which included pathways related to metabolism, erythropoiesis, immune responses, neuronal development, and neurodegenerative disorders.

we further analyzed the expression of genes involved in neuronal development or in neurodegenerative disorders using immunochemistry. thus, we studied the expression of reelin , which is involved in neurogenesis, and we searched for the presence of β-amyloid protein, which is involved in alzheimer's disease. we detected reln only in brains of balb/c mice at days  <dig> and  <dig>  while we showed the presence of β-amyloid only in brains of cba/j and c57bl/ <dig> mice at days  <dig> and  <dig> .

overall, our gene expression analysis revealed marked changes in metabolic energy pathways, the inflammatory response, and pathways related to neurogenesis and neurodegenerative disorders in cm-s mice versus cm-r mice.

discussion
in the present study, we have searched for genes and physiological pathways potentially involved in cm. to this aim, we performed a longitudinal analysis of differentially expressed genes in brains from well-defined genetically cm-r  and cm-s  mice at early and late stages of infection. the present study shows that pba strongly altered gene expression in these mice. in particular, gene expression was deeply altered at the time of cm onset, confirming our previous study  <cit> . here, we show that a number of genes were over-expressed in cm-r mice at the early stage of infection, suggesting that cm-r mice mount an early protective transcriptional response. in this way, we found an association of resistance to cm with an increase in the expression of a number of genes on day  <dig> post-infection . in contrast, a number of genes were found to be under-expressed in c57bl/ <dig> mice at the early stage of infection, while few genes were found to be regulated in cba/j mice at the same time . also, cba/j mice appeared to mount a gradual response that may be involved in cm pathogenesis, while c57bl/ <dig> mice may mount two waves of transcriptional responses both of them potentially implicated in malaria pathogenesis. these observations are consistent with other reports suggesting that cm mediators partly differ between c57bl/ <dig> and cba/j mice  <cit> . nevertheless, both cba/j and c57bl/ <dig> mice showed a pronounced up-regulation of genes involved in either interferon-associated response or in glycolysis at the late stage, and a down-regulation of genes involved in erythropoiesis both at early and late stages, as previously described  <cit> .

to identify genes with significant transcriptional changes associated with cm, we performed, on the whole data set, a multi-class sam procedure with a very stringent false discovery rate followed by a welch t test with a bonferroni correction. in other words, we applied a two-filtering procedure to decrease the number of "false positive" genes. to account for natural variation between mouse strains, we adjusted gene expression level in infected mice for gene expression level in uninfected mice. thus, we identified a number of genes differentially regulated between cm-r and cm-s mice. the  <dig> most differentially expressed genes identified by the sam analysis allowed the complete discrimination between cm-r and cm-s mice according to the time of infection. the same result was obtained with the subset of  <dig> genes identified by the welch t test . this further confirms our previous study that investigated gene expression at the time of cm onset  <cit> .

ease analysis of either the  <dig> genes or the  <dig> genes revealed that some of the most represented biological process categories were related to the "defense response", such as the "response to parasite" or the "inflammatory response" terms. this was further supported by the results of the kegg pathway analysis. in addition, genes were found to be involved in kegg pathways related to metabolism, such as "oxidative phosphorylation", "glycolysis/gluconeogenesis", or "tryptophan metabolism". the analysis of functional annotation also revealed go terms and kegg pathways related to brain, such as the "axon guidance" and the "neurodegenerative disorders" kegg pathways.

overall, the analysis of functional annotation is consistent with the view that mouse cm is characterized among others by the deregulation of both immune response and glucose metabolism  <cit> . this leads to an abnormal increase in the inflammatory response and to hypoglycemia and acidosis in cm-s mice  <cit> . in addition, our data provide evidence of an intrinsic deficiency in oxidative phosphorylation, and the functional annotations related to brain disease suggest the role of genes expressed by brain cells in resistance or susceptibility to cm. thus, despite a number of genes identified by our microarray analysis, which may highlight highly complex interactions between the parasite and the host, several major features of the transcriptional profile can be deduced.

first, pba infection affects the expression of genes involved in metabolic energy pathways. the expression of uqcrq, cox4i <dig>  ndufb <dig>  atp6v1g <dig> and atp5b involved in oxidative phosphorylation was upregulated in cm-r mice on day  <dig> post-infection , suggesting that cerebral oxidative metabolism may be stimulated by pba infection in cm-r mice. in contrast, these genes were downregulated in c57bl/ <dig> mice on day  <dig> post-infection and in cba/j mice on day  <dig> post-infection, while only ndufb <dig> was downregulated in cba/j mice on day  <dig> post-infection. these transcriptional changes were associated with cm. a similar pattern was observed for hmgcs <dig> involved in ketone metabolism. in the same way, lower nad+/nadh levels and decreased mitochondrial function have been observed in cm-s mice by others  <cit> . these observations may be related to hypoxia and hypoglycemia, which reflect the low level of metabolic energy substrates. alternatively, our data are consistent with the "cytopathic hypoxia" hypothesis, which rather proposes an adequate oxygen supply but an abnormal oxygen use  <cit> . also, the low level of oxidative phosphorylation gene expression and ketone bodies pathway genes that we detected in the brain of cm-s mice suggests that cerebral oxidative metabolism may be inhibited even without oxygen delivery being impaired.

this metabolic disturbance also leads to lactate production and acidosis. in addition, this leads to an accumulation of adp, which favors platelet aggregation  <cit> . interestingly, platelet aggregation is known to be stimulated by paf acether and inhibited by ampc, the expression of which is inhibited by lis <dig>  and pde4b, respectively  <cit> . overall, the lower expression of pafah1b <dig> in cm-s mice compared to cm-r mice  <cit> , the higher expression of pde4b in cm-s mice compared to cm-r mice, and the metabolic disturbance leading to an accumulation of adp may participate in the platelet aggregation process in the cerebral microvasculature of cm-s mice.

second, it is likely that the inflammatory response plays a major role in cm pathogenesis. in particular, a surge of ifnγ production at  <dig> to  <dig> days p.i. was demonstrated to be essential for murine cm, and this may be due to the absence of regulation in ifnγ pathways at early stages in pba infection  <cit> . ifnγ is a proinflammatory cytokine typically produced by th <dig> lymphocytes, and it is thought that the th <dig> response protects from cm  <cit> . in this way, our microarray analysis showed that il <dig> and il4r were over-expressed in cm-r mice from day  <dig>  similarly, dnaja <dig>  foxo3a, and ptpns <dig> that inhibit the activity of nf-kb  <cit>  had lower expression levels in cm-s mice than in cm-r mice, while nfkbia, a marker of the nf-kb signalling pathway involved in inflammation  <cit> , was over-expressed in cm-s mice. in addition, c1qa and pde4b that are involved in the inflammatory response  <cit>  were found to be over-expressed in cm-s mice compared to cm-r mice. s100a <dig> that inhibits the activity of phospholipase a <dig>  <cit> , and bcl <dig> that inhibits the production of mip-alpha and ip- <dig>  <cit>  were under-expressed in cm-s mice compared to cm-r mice. blood cells are known to be involved in the inflammatory response due to malarial infection. indeed, cd4+ and cd8+ t lymphocytes, platelets, monocytes have been shown to cooperate in the cerebral microvasculature, and this causes inflammation, endothelial cell damage, and hemorrhages  <cit> . in addition, gzmb, whose expression was up-regulated in cm-s mice  <cit> , encodes granzyme b in cytotoxic t lymphocytes, and is thought to be involved in the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier  <cit> . the influence of immune responses on the blood-brain barrier may be partly reflected by changes in expression of genes involved in either cytoskeletal and tight-junction pathways or cell adhesion pathways in cm-s mice.

it has been also suggested that glial cells actively participate in the local inflammatory response caused by malarial infection  <cit> . in this way, glial cells that have been shown to be activated on day  <dig> post-infection by pba can produce c1q components  <cit> . the nf-kb signalling pathway has been demonstrated in these cells  <cit> . interestingly, cd <dig> that is implicated in the control of the activation of glial cells was strongly under-expressed in the cba/j cm-s mice  <cit> . besides, the expression of il <dig> and il4r was shown to be higher in cm-r mice than in cm-s mice. since il- <dig> induces apoptosis in activated glial cells that express il-4r  <cit> , il- <dig> may contribute to the down-regulation of brain inflammation in cm-r mice.

third, genes involved in the neuroprotection/neurotoxicity balance and/or in neurogenesis may protect the host against cm. this hypothesis is based on changes in tryptophan metabolism caused by pba infection. sanni et al  showed an increase of the activity of indoleamine  <dig> -dioxygenase whose expression is induced by tnf and ifnγ  <cit> . this leads to an increase of the ratio quinolinic acid/kynurenic acid, and to neuro-excitotoxic damage associated with cm. in humans, high levels of quinolinic acid have been associated with cm  <cit> . interestingly, genes involved in tryptophan metabolism, such as ube3a, prnt <dig>  and aldh1b <dig>  were differentially regulated between cm-r and cm-s mice. the expression of these genes was enhanced by infection in cm-r mice. in addition, genes having a neuroprotective role, such agtr <dig>  bag <dig>  csnk1a <dig> and reln  <cit> , were shown to be over-expressed in cm-r mice compared to cm-s mice. indeed, rtn <dig> and creb <dig> that are markers of neuronal survival  <cit> , were also over-expressed in cm-r mice. besides, reln and dab <dig>  which were over-expressed in cm-r mice, are known to be involved in neurogenesis  <cit> . similarly, pafah1b <dig> whose expression was associated with resistance to cm  <cit>  is involved in the reln pathway  <cit> . this suggests that cm-s mice are deficient in neurogenesis, and that they cannot repair neuronal damages. in contrast, cm-r mice might be able to repair such damage .

so far, little research has been conducted on the issue of neuroprotective responses in cm. interestingly, the reln pathway that inhibits the phosphorylation of the protein tau has been recently proposed as a protective mechanism against alzheimer'disease  <cit> . in addition, decreased ribosomal rna levels and decreased rates for protein synthesis have been recently described in alzheimer'disease  <cit> , while we showed the down-regulation of several genes encoding ribosomal proteins in cm-s mice. in the same way, medana et al  detected β-amyloid precursor protein in humans with cm  <cit> , and we report here the β-amyloid protein in brains of cm-s mice but not in cm-r mice. this result is consistent with the down-regulation of arc, itm2b, bsg, rtn <dig>  and il <dig> in cm-s mice, and with the up-regulation of pde4b in cm-s mice. indeed, itm2b, bsg, rtn <dig>  and il <dig> inhibit the production of the β-amyloid protein  <cit> . besides, the β-amyloid protein inhibits the expression of arc, while it increases the expression of pde4b  <cit> . these observations suggest that cerebral malaria and alzheimer'disease share some common mechanisms of pathogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have confirmed that gene-expression profiling discriminates between cm-r and cm-s mice, and we have identified genes whose expression showed consistent differential expression between cm-r and cm-s mice at early and late stages of infection. the analysis of gene functional annotation reveals several major features. first, it indicated that brain metabolic energy metabolism was early and deeply disturbed in cm-s mice, suggesting that high lactate production may be due rather to metabolic disturbance than to deficient oxygen supply. second, the influence of inflammatory response on cm was also clearly detected, and our data are consistent with an active role of microglial cells in local inflammation. third, the outcome of infection may critically depend on either cerebral tissue protective responses or brain repair capacity. overall, our microarray analysis may give a global overview of critical events occurring in cm-s mice compared to cm-r mice. searching for polymorphisms that alter the expression of genes identified should help in determining the genetic control of cerebral malaria. this analysis also revealed some promising areas for exploration that may both provide new insight into the key events that govern cm pathogenesis and the development of therapeutic strategies. in particular, novel neuroprotective therapies may be proposed as adjuncts to anti-malarial therapy.
