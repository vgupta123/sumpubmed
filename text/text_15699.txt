BACKGROUND
opportunistic pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa are a major health concern due to increased antibiotic resistance  <cit> . phages could be an alternative to antibiotics, therefore, it is important to investigate phage biology and phage-host interactions  <cit> .

phages are ubiquitous and up to  <dig> * <dig> virus particles have been enumerated per ml in natural water  <cit>  with about  <dig> million estimated phage species  <cit> . in august  <dig>   <dig> complete genome sequences of phages were available and among these sequences were  <dig> sequences of pseudomonas specific phages . it was stated that about 75% of all sequenced viral genes share no identity to any gene in databases, therefore, most of the viral diversity is uncharacterized  <cit> . the amount of sequence information of tailed phages increased dramatically in the last years  <cit> . characterization of phages is based on morphology as well as on combined genomic and proteomic approaches  <cit> . other publications describe the host range of phages, which is important with regard to phage therapy  <cit> .

in this work, we characterized a newly isolated p. aeruginosa broad-host-range phage named jg <dig> on genome level and applied a transposon mutagenesis approach of the respective host bacterium to identify genes in p. aeruginosa, which are essential during phage infection. this approach is fast, provides new insights into phage biology and can be easily adapted for the characterization of other phages.

RESULTS
family affiliation
the morphology and size of jg <dig> phage particles were assessed by transmission electron microscopy , see methods. in figure  <dig>  a isometric head structure is visible with a diameter of  <dig> nm. the contractile tail, which consists of a neck, a contractile sheath and a central tube, has a length of  <dig> nm. due to the morphology and the identification of dsdna by the sensitivity of restriction endonucleases like hindiii , jg <dig> belongs to the familiy myoviridae. the tailed phages comprise three families: myoviridae, siphoviridase as well as podoviridae. it was stated that 96% of the investigated phages belong to the tailed phages. in particular, there are approximately  <dig> tailed pseudomonas phages known, among them  <dig> from the family myoviridae  <cit> . we describe the morphology of phage jg <dig> together with the comparison of its genome sequence below.

phage receptor and host range
determination of the phage receptor was performed as described in the methods section. different p. aeruginosa mutant strains which lack flagella , pili  or a complete lps  were used to investigate the ability of jg <dig> to infect these mutant strains. the gene algc encodes an enzyme with phosphoglucomutase and phosphomannomutase activity and is required for the biosynthesis of the complete p. aeruginosa lps core  <cit> . the phage jg <dig> is able to lyse flagella and pili mutants but not the algc mutant defect in lps biosynthesis, which indicates that lps is the receptor of jg <dig> 

in order to determine the host range of jg <dig>  we used a set of  <dig> clinical isolates to investigate the ability of jg <dig> to infect these strains . jg <dig> is able to infect around 50% of the tested clinical isolates , suggesting that jg <dig> belongs to the broad-host-range phages. additionally, jg <dig> is even capable of infecting a p. aeruginosa muca mutant, which produces large amounts of exopolysaccharides and displayes a mucoid phenotype  <cit> . mucoid p. aeruginosa strains are frequently isolated from patients suffering from cystic fibrosis and are correlated with a poor prognosis  <cit> .

growth characteristics
genome properties and organization
the entire genome sequence of phage jg <dig> was determined as described in methods and revealed a genome with a size of  <dig>  bp. detailed inspection of the  <dig> sequence reads as well as two possible genome assemblies, revealed some interesting features of the jg <dig> genome. a small part  of the jg <dig> genome has a twice to three times higher coverage by sequence reads compared to the rest of the genome . this high coverage could be either an artifact of  <dig> sequencing or it indicates that this region might be present in multiple copies in the genome as a repetitive sequence. one possible arrangement could be a linear genome, which is flanked with the genome region  at both ends. this is supported by the identification of  <dig> reads, which start exactly at the same position . also, at the end of this part , we identified  <dig> sequence reads which all stop at the same position indicating the endpoint of a linear genome . this data suggests that the  <dig> bp fragment is present at the beginning and the end of the genome.

to verify whether this part of the genome is present in one or multiple copies and to assess the chromosomal structure, we amplified this part of the genome by pcr using primers which bind outside of the putative repetitive sequence at the respective 5' and 3'-flanking regions. assuming a circular genome we amplified the region using a primer which binds at position  <dig>  and one primer which binds at position  <dig> . both primers generated a pcr product of  <dig> bp, which corresponds to only one copy of the genome region  <dig> to  <dig>  confirming the  <dig> sequence data . moreover, we sequenced the pcr product and again confirmed the  <dig> sequence data. this result only indicates that the jg <dig> genome does not contain two consecutive copies of the putative repetitive sequence. the investigation of the linearity of the jg <dig> genome following treatment with exonuclease bal <dig>  <cit> , which degrades only double-stranded linear dna, gave inconsistent results for the genome of jg <dig>  we decided to integrate only one copy of the region from position  <dig> to  <dig> 

annotation of the jg <dig> sequence identified  <dig> putative coding sequences and a gc content of  <dig> % . the general characteristics of the phage genome are summarized in table  <dig> 

the presence of genes coding for trnas was investigated using the tool trnascan-se  <dig>   <cit> . with this software, we were able to identify twelve trnas in the genome of jg <dig>  which are summarized in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  the presence of trna genes is common in members of the myoviridae phages with large genomes. it was pointed out earlier that trna genes in phages are almost always clustered and that they may facilitate a more rapid overall translation rate, especially the translation rate of rare codons  <cit> .

we also searched the jg <dig> genome for the presence of promoters, terminators and regulatory elements as described in the methods section. no convincing sigma 70-dependent promoter region was identified in a suitable location using the web service sak  <cit> . however, we identified  <dig> putative rho-independent terminator regions using the transtermhp software tool  <cit>  . all terminators are at the right location downstream of an annotated gene. we also scanned  <dig> bp of the 5' region of all jg <dig> orfs for the presence of conserved motifs using the program meme  <cit> . we identified a conserved putative shine dalgarno sequence with the consensus aaggag  3- <dig> nt in front of the predicted atg start codon of  <dig> orfs. this sequence is more closely positioned to the atg start codon than the shine dalgarno sequence in gram-negative bacteria as e.g. e. coli, which is positioned 7- <dig> nt to the atg start. moreover, we detected two at rich motifs in front of  <dig> and  <dig> cds, respectively, which may indicate putative phage promoters .

terminator sequences are shown as displayed by transtermhp. each terminator sequence starts with  <dig> nt of the 5' tail  followed by the 5' stem, loop, 3' stem and  <dig> nt of the 3' tail . score as provided by transtermhp, only terminators with a score above  <dig> are shown.

features of the jg <dig> genome
a schematic representation of the genome, with its predicted cdss, the trna locations, some functional assignments and overall genetic organization is shown in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  the genome of phage jg <dig> shows  <dig> % intergenic space. this is comparable with the genome of the host p. aeruginosa pao <dig> which has  <dig> % non-coding regions  <cit> . putative functions could be assigned to only  <dig>  genes based on sequence similarities . although phage jg <dig> and pak-p <dig> share strong similarities, we found  <dig> genes with no similarities to pak-p <dig> including  <dig> genes with no significant similarities to any protein in the database. the proteins with no similarity to other proteins are small proteins with a size between  <dig> aa and  <dig> aa. it is still difficult to accurately predict short genes with computational methods  <cit> , therefore, these predictions are uncertain.

no significant match to proteins annotated as integrase, repressor or transposase was found, suggesting that this phage is a virulent phage which is in concordance with the results of the highly related phage pak-p <dig>  <cit> .

gene  <dig> has similarities to rna polymerases  suggesting that the phage jg <dig> is probably not dependent on the host transcriptional machinery. moreover, genes encoding for enzymes of the dna replication machinery were found, suggesting that the dna replication is also independent from the host. we found genes with similarities to a dna polymerase , a dna helicase/primase , a thymidylate synthetase , a ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase  and to a putative exodeoxyribunuclease . a terminase like gene  could also be detected. phage terminases are dna packaging enzymes and are among the most conserved proteins found in phages. some terminases also contain endonuclease activity to cut dna into the genome length of the respective phage  <cit> . two putative endonucleases were also detected . endonucleases could be involved in the dna packaging process or in host nucleic acid damaging. interestingly, the putative endonuclease gene  <dig> has no homologue in phage pak-p <dig> 

moreover, one putative methyltransferase was found . methyltransferases are important for the methylation of dna to protect the dna against it's own endonucleases or endonucleases of the host, which serve as a protection against foreign dna and infection of phages.

sequence based predictions identified only six genes probably involved in virion morphogenesis: gene  <dig> and  <dig> , gene  <dig> and  <dig> , gene  <dig>  as well as gene  <dig>  which encode for the major capsid protein . a putative tape measure protein was also detected  close to the putative structural proteins. it was shown for phage t <dig> that the so called tape measure protein regulates the length of the phage tail  <cit> .

lysis of phages with dsdna is accomplished by two proteins, an endolysin, which degrades the peptidoglycan and a holin, which permeabilizes the cytoplasmic membrane to release the endolysin into the periplasm  <cit> . we found one gene, which shares 98% identity to the endolysin of the pseudomonas phage pap <dig> . however, we could not detect any similarities to a holin. this is not unexpected, since holins are very diverse and classified into twelve unrelated orthologous groups  <cit> .

 <dig> putative small proteins with less than  <dig> amino acids were found in in the genome of phage jg <dig>  none of these small proteins has a predicted function. it was shown before that phage genomes contain small proteins with unknown function  <cit> . it is speculated that these proteins may have a role as accessory factors that bind to and subtly modify the specificity of host proteins so that they function appropriately during phage infection  <cit> .

interestingly, one hypothetical protein shared a low identity  with a homospermidine synthase . we could show that phage jg <dig> is spermidine-dependent since it is not able to infect a p. aeruginosa mutant with a defect in spermidine synthesis . a homospermidine synthase produces homospermidine out of spermidine and putrescine. it is suggested that polyamines like spermidine are important for the dna charge balance during dna packaging  <cit> . the negative charge of the dna is shielded by the positive charge of the polyamine and allows compact packaging.

integration of the transposon was identified by arbitrary pcr.* = according to http://www.pseudomonas.com

similarities of jg <dig> to other phages
comparison of the genome with other phage genomes present in databases revealed that phage jg <dig> is highly related to the recently published phage pak-p <dig>  <cit>  with 87% identity on the nucleotide level. a mauve analysis  <cit>  between jg <dig> and pak-p <dig> identified only few insertions or deletions, see additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  this suggests that these phages could belong to the same genus within the myoviridae family.

using blastp searches we identified predicted proteins with a sequence identity between  <dig> to 99% to pseudomonas phage kpp <dig> proteins  <cit>  . although phage kpp <dig> shares a similar morphology to jg <dig> with a head size of  <dig> nm and a tail length of  <dig> nm, genome alignments revealed that only 8% of the kpp <dig> genome shares similarities between 66% and 95% to jg <dig>  clearly, despite some morphological similarities, the genome sequence does not indicate any close relationship. in addition to phage pak-p <dig> and to a lesser extent to phage kpp <dig>  no significant genome sequence homology to other phages has been observed. the major capsid protein of jg <dig> shares 100% identity to the major capsid protein of pak-p <dig> and as described by debarbieux et al.  <cit> , 33% identity to the major capsid protein of the salmonella phage felixo <dig>  <cit> . while jg <dig> and felixo <dig> seem related regarding the size of phage head and tail structures  we did not detect any significant similarity to phage felixo <dig> or related phages as erwinia phage phiea21- <dig> or enterobacteria phage wv <dig> on the genome level. however, we identified four proteins with an identity from  <dig> to 49% to another orphan phage: escherichia phage rv <dig> with no apparent relative  <cit> . again no significant similarity on the genome level was observed. the same observation was made for the widespread pb1-like phages 14- <dig>  f <dig>  lbl <dig>  lma <dig>  pb <dig> and sn. although the phages have a similar morphology , the genomes of these phages share no significant similarity to phage jg <dig> 

transposon mutagenesis
we screened a random p. aeruginosa transposon library to identify p. aeruginosa genes essential for infection by phage jg <dig>  a mixture of random transposon p. aeruginosa mutants were infected by phage jg <dig> . only p. aeruginosa mutants, which contained a mutation in a gene essential for phage infection, survived the phage treatment. these strains were isolated and the genomic position of the mariner transposon was identified by arbitrary pcr . a total of approximately  <dig> transposon mutants were screened and  <dig> phage resistant mutants were isolated and analyzed. since two mutants, tm <dig> and tm <dig> are defect in the same gene, rmlb, a total of  <dig> genes was identified, which are essential for phage infection.

the transposon screen revealed genes important for lps biosynthesis  like the gene algc which is needed for a complete lps core in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . it also revealed the genes rmla and rmlb, which are involved in the biosynthesis of the lps core sugars  <cit> . these findings confirm that the phage jg <dig> uses lps as receptor. other identified genes involved in lps biosynthesis are wzz <dig>  waal, miga, pa <dig> and pa <dig>   <cit> .

since nine out of  <dig> identified genes encoded proteins involved in lps biosynthesis, we additionally isolated lps from all mutant strains and analyzed it by electrophoresis . figure  <dig> shows the lps profiles of the transposon mutants. the lipid a, which migrates furthest due to its size, is seen as a dark grey spot at the end of the gel. the migration depends on changes in the lps composition, mostly in the core polysaccharide which is adjacent to the lipid a  <cit> . not all lps biosynthesis genes cause changes in the lps which are visible by electrophorsis e.g. miga  <cit> , which appears as wild type lps. the black line in figure  <dig> indicates the migration level of the wild type lipid a. dramatic changes in the lps profile which differs clearly from the p. aeruginosa wild type lps can be seen for the algc, the wzz <dig> and the pa <dig> mutant. further analysis of the lps for example western blot analysis with antibodies specific to the different components of the lps could provide a better understanding of the mutants, but was not involved in this phage characterization study.

we also identified genes essential for phage infection, which encode proteins of unknown function. the gene pa <dig> encodes a protein with a weak similarity to an amine oxidase, the gene pa <dig> encodes again a conserved hypothetical protein with an fad binding domain, pa <dig> encodes a putative acetate-coa ligase and gene pa <dig> encodes a conserved hypothetical protein with an eal domain, which indicates that this protein could hydrolyze the signal molecule cyclic-di-gmp . however, the role of these proteins during phage infection is unclear and is currently under investigation in our laboratory.

the gene pa <dig> encodes the sped protein, an s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, which is an essential part of the spermidine biosynthesis pathway in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . these results suggest that the infection process of phage jg <dig> is dependent on spermidine. as pointed out earlier, jg <dig> also possesses a probable homospermidine synthase, which uses spermidine and purtrescine to synthesize homospermidine. spermidine itself or homospermidine could be important substances essential for compact packaging of phage dna by balancing the negative charge of the dna  <cit> .

the analysis of p. aeruginosa transposon mutants resistant to phage infection confirmed that phage jg <dig> recognizes lps as receptor. moreover, this approach revealed details of phage jg <dig> biology, e.g. its dependance on spermidine.

CONCLUSIONS
we characterized a p. aeruginosa specific broad-host-range phage which is a member of the myoviridae phage family. jg <dig> has a contractile sheath and a central tube with a length of  <dig> nm and an isometric head structure with a diameter of  <dig> nm. jg <dig> uses lps as receptor and has a burst size of  <dig> phage particles. genome analysis revealed that this phage shares 87% identity to phage pak-p <dig>  despite its morphological similarity to other phages, no significant identity to other phage genomes was detected.

we used a transposon mutagenesis approach of the host to identify genes important for phage infection. this approach indicated a dependance of jg <dig> on spermidine production of the host bacterium and confirmed lps as host receptor. in addition to the characterization of host-phage biology, this approach could be an interesting tool to perform host receptor studies or to investigate genes of unknown function such as e.g. p. aeruginosa genes involved in lps biosynthesis.
