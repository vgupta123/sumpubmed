BACKGROUND
in recent years, cpg methylation analyses have been focused mainly on epigenetics, allowing researchers to quantitatively assess important markers of differential gene expression. in particular, analyses by next-generation sequencing  provide extremely high-coverage genome-wide methylome data with all cpg methylation levels precisely measured  <cit> . however, some of the whole-genome analyses are occasionally considered to be insufficient in terms of quantitative performance  <cit> . moreover, the whole-genome methods remain unsuitable for investigations with large sample sizes owing to high costs. nevertheless, a few genome-wide methods that can be performed at a relatively low cost per sample are available. for example, the infinium beadchip system, which is based on microarray technology and sodium bisulfite treatment, has recently been used for a large set of human blood dna samples in massive cohort projects  <cit> . however, a major limitation is that the infinium platform is designed only for cpg islands of the human genome  <cit> . therefore, alternative methods that can be better applied to large sample sizes should be developed. furthermore, such a method should be convenient, cost-effective, and capable of processing multiple samples simultaneously, allowing small variations to be detected with adequate accuracy.

in this study we developed a technique, methylated site display , which displays only dna fragments that are cpg-methylated at the 5′ end in the original genomic dna sample. in combination with amplified fragment length polymorphism  analysis , we designed msd-aflp analysis for obtaining methylated-cpgs profiles at a relatively low cost. by msd-aflp analysis, we compared the dna methylation levels in three tissues from c57bl/6j mice to evaluate the precision and sensitivity of this method.

RESULTS
conceptual design of msd-aflp
as shown in fig.  <dig>  dna samples ligated with adaptor a were digested with mspi, an isoschizomer for hpaii. the other end of the dna fragments was ligated with adaptor b and then digested with the methylation-sensitive hpaii. if the adaptor b-ligated fragment contains a methylated cpg, adaptor b is not removed in this step. a similar description of the sensitivity of the hemi-methylated dna to hpaii was seen in the recent literature  <cit> . only these dna fragments retaining adaptor b are amplified by the subsequent pre-pcr to generate the msd library. therefore, dna fragments sandwiched between the primary restriction enzyme  site and the nearest hpaii site are to be amplified only when the nearest hpaii-cpg is methylated.fig.  <dig> flowchart of msd-library preparation. genomic dna  was digested with  <dig> units of the primary restriction enzyme sbfi for 1 h and then ligated with  <dig>  nmol adaptor a using  <dig> units of t <dig> dna ligase for 2 h. the treated sample was then digested with  <dig> units of the non-methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme mspi  followed by ligation of the ends of the dna fragment with adaptor b. the ligated dna fragments were then digested with  <dig> units of hpaii for 1 h. owing to the methylation sensitivity of hapii, only dna fragments with a methylated cpg retained adaptor b, which was removed from all other fragments. the dna fragments were then subjected to pre-pcr using specific primers for adaptor a and adaptor b. fragments that did not contain adaptor b at this stage were not amplified. the pre-pcr amplicons  were then amplified as a subpopulation by selective-pcr with 6-carboxyfluorescein -labelled selective-pcr primers. finally, the selective-pcr products were electrophoresed with a capillary sequencer and separated by length




a total of  <dig> , <dig> hpaii sites are found in the mouse reference genome. to obtain reliable and high-resolution aflp electropherograms, it is necessary to keep sufficient spacing between signal peaks. when separated in a capillary sequencer, the preferable number of peaks should be smaller than  <dig> in one run. using the search capabilities of genome dna fragment database , three primary restriction enzymes, sbfi, paci and swai, were found to provide desirable peak numbers. in this study, therefore, we chose sbfi as the primary restriction enzyme. we then used gfdb to calculate the number of sbfi-hpaii fragments as well as the distribution of fragment size in the mouse reference genome sequence to assess aflp resolution . it is understood that the ability to interpret peak data diminishes as fragment lengths overlap. nonetheless, we found that  <dig>  of the  <dig>  fragments  do not overlap in size and are predicted to display a single peak on an aflp chart. despite covering only  <dig> % of all cpgs in the reference genome  in one analysis, this technique seems to have sufficient profiling capabilities. in addition, as a result of examining the distribution of methylated sites detected by this method, cpg sites in intragenic regions, which can be detected by msd-aflp, were  <dig> % out of the whole genome.

we then expanded gfdb to apply other organisms, i.e., human , zebrafish and neurospora crassa. the number of sbfi-hpaii fragments as well as the distribution of fragment size in the human, zebrafish, and n. crassa reference genome sequences were used to assess aflp resolution in the same way as in the mouse genome sequence. we found that  <dig>  of the  <dig>  fragments  in humans and  <dig>  of the  <dig>  fragments  in zebrafish do not overlap in size and are predicted to display a single peak on an aflp chart. however, in the case of n. crassa, only appoximately  <dig> sbfi-hpaii fragments were found, suggesting that sbfi cuts n. crassa dna much less than it does the other three organisms. therefore, alternative restriction enzymes such as ncoi, asei, or bsphi should be used. we found that  <dig>  of the  <dig>  ncoi-hpaii fragments  do not overlap in size on an aflp chart of n. crassa.

reproducibility of msd-aflp
we examined the reproducibility of msd-aflp by comparing two msd libraries independently constructed from the same kidney dna preparation. aflp analysis was performed for each library using  <dig> selective primer sets, resulting in a total of  <dig> signal peaks to be compared. we found that the methylation level profiles of the two experimental replicates coincided well with one another, as shown by the florescence peaks in fig. 2a. the coefficient of determination, r <dig>  was  <dig> , indicating reliable reproducibility of msd-aflp .fig.  <dig> reproducibility of msd-aflp analysis. a two aflp peak charts from msd libraries independently generated from the same genomic dna preparation are presented in this panel as replicates  <dig> and  <dig>  profiles of the signal peaks from the two independent experiments were in high agreement. b

accuracy of msd-aflp
using msd-aflp, we compared the methylation levels of three mouse tissues . for each tissue, we used  <dig> selective primer sets out of  <dig> possible sets for pcr. we detected  <dig> aflp signals and succeeded in identifying cpg sites that are differentially methylated among the three kinds of tissue . eleven signal peaks were randomly selected and submitted as an inquiry to gfdb to retrieve candidate loci for the cpg sites. in parallel, the sequences of the  <dig> dna fragments were directly determined by gel isolation. although three extra false dna loci were retrieved, all of the  <dig> dna sequences matched the candidate loci predicted by gfdb . the percentage of one-to-one correspondence was  <dig> % in this case. additionally, we performed another  <dig> runs of gel isolation to determine the sequences. out of them, the  <dig> sequences represented one-to-one correspondence  . these values are very reasonable considering the non-overlapping ratio  predicted in additional file 1: figure s2b.fig.  <dig> aflp electropherogram peak charts obtained by msd-aflp analysis. each color electropherogram represents data from one of three tissues: red hippocampus; blue kidney; green liver. a total of  <dig> electropherograms are seen in the charts, because three samples from each tissue were analyzed. black numbers and arrows indicate peak ids  randomly selected for this study. note that several cpgs were detected as differentially methylated across the three types of tissue, as seen in peak id  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  furthermore, among the three mouse samples, methylation patterns were in agreement among the tissues




next, we designed locus-specific primers for msre-pcr analysis in accordance with the reference sequences of the  <dig> dna fragments to measure the relative methylation levels of hpaii-cpg sites and compare them with the relative fluorescence intensities obtained by msd-aflp analysis . msd-aflp analysis had showed relative values similar to that of the msre-pcr relative values in all  <dig> fragments, suggesting that the two are consistent . furthermore, a scatter plot of the relative values of the two methods indicates a strong correlation between the two  .fig.  <dig> confirmation of the accuracy of msd-aflp analysis by msre-pcr. a relative methylation levels of  <dig> cpg sites in fig.  <dig> determined by msre-pcr analysis using locus-specific primers. b relative fluorescence intensity obtained from msd-aflp data. c

percent methylation level from msd-aflp peak charts
the percent methylation levels of each cpg were calculated from the fluorescence intensity of each peak in msd-aflp as follows. first, we determined the percent methylation levels of the  <dig> cpgs by msre-pcr analysis, as shown in fig. 5a. next, we subjected sssi-treated artificially methylated dna to msd-aflp analysis in order to theoretically obtain fully methylated signal intensities at each cpg site . using the fluorescence intensities of the  <dig> peaks in fig.  <dig>  signal ratios  were obtained by dividing the fluorescence intensity of each tissue dna by that of the sssi-treated artificially methylated dna. after scatter plotting this data, an approximation formula expressing the relationship between the percent methylation determined by msre-pcr analysis and sr was developed using the hill equation in order to normalize the values to a range from  <dig> to  <dig> . finally, the percent methylation levels of all cpgs in the msd-aflp peak charts were calculated by substituting sr into this approximation formula. the methylation levels of the  <dig> cpgs are shown in fig. 5d.fig.  <dig> percent methylation levels of cpgs in the msd-aflp peak charts. a percent methylation levels derived from msre-pcr. b typical peak chart from liver dna  and sssi-treated artificially methylated dna . c

to further verify the percent methylation levels of the msd-aflp peak charts, we randomly selected two peak ids,  <dig> and  <dig>  for bisulfite genomic sequencing for methylation analysis. our results showed that the percent methylation levels obtained by msd-aflp analysis were highly consistent with those obtained by bisulfite genomic sequencing in the three tissues, as well as those by msre-pcr analysis .

finally, the percent methylation levels of all  <dig> cpgs in the three tissues were analyzed by hierarchical clustering analysis and principal component analysis  . significant clusters were found for every tissue, highlighting the capability of msd-aflp analysis to detect unique and contrasting methylation patterns between tissues. moreover, significant isolation of the principal of each tissue component was observable by pca.

sensitivity of msd-aflp analysis
in order to assess the sensitivity of msd-aflp analysis to subtle differences in methylation levels, we evaluated the differences in cpg-methylation levels between each tissue. by one-way anova, we found that a total of  <dig> cpgs out of the analyzed  <dig> cpgs have statistically significant differences in methylation level. we identified the combination of tissues responsible for this difference using the post hoc tukey test. we found showed a statistically significant differences in methylation level in  <dig> cpgs between the hippocampus and the liver , in  <dig> cpgs between the hippocampus and the kidney , and in  <dig> cpgs between the kidney and the liver . furthermore, our results indicated that msd-aflp analysis had the sensitivity to detect  <dig> cpgs with less than 5% and  <dig> -fold differences in methylation levels and ratios of methylation levels, respectively. in fig. 6d, we present two randomly selected cpgs, which have slight but statistically significant differences in methylation levels determined by msd-aflp analysis between the hippocampus and the liver , and the kidney and the liver . for confirmation, msre-pcr analysis using locus-specific primers for measuring percent methylation level also detected a similar statistically significant difference between the two tissues .fig.  <dig> sensitivity of msd-aflp analysis. a–c

discussion
in this study, we developed a unique method, msd-aflp analysis, for determining cpg methylation level profiles with high sensitivity and accuracy. although msd-aflp analysis covers only  <dig> % of cpgs sites out of the whole genome, it can provide cpg methylation level profiles of a multitude of cpgs  in a single analysis with almost the same precision as msre-pcr analysis, a quantitative pcr method, as well as with relatively low cost compared with other current array-based or ngs-based genome wide dna methylation analyses.

the widespread use of ngs technology has led to a number of methods for analyzing cpg methylation levels within the whole genome. of these, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing is the most powerful technique, providing extremely high-coverage genome wide methylome data with all cpg methylation levels precisely measured  <cit> . similarly, methylated dna immunoprecipitation-seq  <cit>  and hpaii tiny fragment enrichment by ligation-mediated pcr-tagging  <cit>  analyses were developed by incorporating ngs. however, these methods remain unsuitable for investigations with large sample sizes on account of their expensiveness and do not offer satisfactory quantitative performance even when more expensive measures are taken to obtain sufficient depths. reduced representation bisulfite sequencing can provide quantitative values of numerous cpg methylations  <cit>  however, even in analyses utilizing machines such as solid  and hiseq  <dig> , the average depth of coverage is usually only approximately 30– <dig> reads  <cit> . out of all current ngs technologies, only the roche  <dig> sequencing system , which is capable of obtaining relatively long sequences in one read, can provide such a high rate of mapping. even so, with the roche  <dig> system, more than  <dig> reads are required to detect a 5% methylation level difference in the sequence of one sample  <cit> . in contrast, the msd-aflp analysis established in this study was capable of easily detecting significant differences of less than 5% in methylation level . in current studies of methylation analyses, huge numbers of samples containing various cell types are usually required to obtain significant data  <cit> . since multiple samples can be processed simultaneously in msd-aflp analysis, allowing small variations to be detected with adequate accuracy at a low cost, this method will be advantageous for a variety of epigenetics-based research studies.

regarding the cost-benefit of current genome wide analyses, infinium® assay  has become the preferred choice, which can be used to analyze the methylation levels of approximately  <dig>  cpgs  <cit> . at present, however, this platform is designed only for the human genome and is biased towards cpg islands in the promoter region. in contrast, msd-aflp analysis can be used for any kind of organism.

in the research fields of hygiene and environmental toxicology, it has been pointed out that environmental chemicals and pollutants can cause diseases that are developmental in origin, possibly resulting from abnormal epigenetic alterations such as those in dna methylation  <cit> . several genome wide dna methylation analyses showed that environmental chemicals, such as vinclozolin and bisphenol-a, can cause changes in cpg methylation level, which can be transmitted to next-generation offspring . these inheritable dna methylation changes were measured using sperm nuclear dna; however, the reliability and reproducibility of these studies are still controversial  <cit> . in terms of verifying the accuracy of previous reports, our msd-aflp analysis will be useful for analyzing such subtle changes in the cpg methylation pattern induced by environmental factors that are transmitted to later generations.

with regard to other applications, msd-aflp analysis will also be a useful tool in clinical cancer research. investigating the epigenetic markers of cancer stem cells in a multitude of clinical samples is of significant interest . although the genome coverage of msd-aflp is  <dig> % out of all cpg sites in the whole genome, msd-aflp analysis can be used to screen a large number of clinical samples with relatively low cost.

CONCLUSIONS
msd-aflp analysis can be potentially used to measure slight changes in cpg methylation level. on the basis of our results regarding the remarkable precision, sensitivity, and throughput of msd-aflp, we conclude that this method will be advantageous in a variety of epigenetics-based studies.
