BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus  is responsible for many nosocomial and community-acquired infections. its pathogenicity is attributed to its ability to produce many membrane-associated components and extracellular substances, several of which have been implicated as virulence factors  <cit> . one of the most unique manifestations among the various staphylococcal infections is staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome . the associated toxin tss toxin- <dig>  is encoded by the tst gene, and might also be involved in the genesis of some autoimmune diseases  <cit> . the accessory gene regulator  operon among several potentially associated factors is thought to positively regulate tsst- <dig> production  <cit> . the agr locus comprises  <dig> genes  that function in both transcription and translation to regulate numerous toxins, enzymes and cell surface proteins. a polymorphism in a variable region of the agr locus comprises nucleotide sequences encoding agrd, the c-terminal two-thirds of agrb, and a portion of the n-terminal half of agrc, which has led to the assignation of s. aureus isolates into four classes  <cit> . in addition to the agr polymorphism, mutations of wild-type s. aureus strains resulting in agr deletions alter exoprotein biosynthesis  <cit> . however, the relationship between the agr polymorphism and tsst- <dig> production is unknown.

we previously analyzed images from two-dimensional electrophoresis  and found that two clinical methicillin-resistant s. aureus  isolates produce relatively large amounts of superantigenic exotoxins  <cit> . since the amount of toxins produced is probably directly related to the virulence of s. aureus, evaluating the concentration of toxins produced by each strain might be useful for controlling infection.

the aim of this study was to determine whether tsst- <dig> production varies among clinical mrsa strains and whether it is related to variations in agr class and structure.

RESULTS
detection of the tst gene and agr classes
we detected the tst gene in  <dig>  of  <dig> strains after pcr amplification. among them,  <dig> of  <dig> strains from the nation-wide collection  and  <dig> isolated from  <dig> blood samples  harbored the gene. we identified  <dig> of  <dig> isolates  as agr class  <dig>  and  <dig> isolates as agr class  <dig> . we did not identify any isolates of agr classes  <dig> or  <dig>  the classes of  <dig> strains were unidentifiable. among  <dig> tst-positive strains,  <dig> belonged to agr class  <dig>  these results indicated the clonal dissemination of a specific group of tst-positive and agr class  <dig> mrsa in japanese hospitals.

evaluation of tsst- <dig> production
we measured the amount of tsst- <dig> produced in  <dig> randomly selected strains. the densities of the bands detected by western blotting correlated in a semi-log manner with the amount of rtsst- <dig> produced. the amounts of tsst- <dig> secreted into culture supernatants evaluated by comparison with the standard curve ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg/ml. thus, the amount of tsst- <dig> produced varied 170-fold among clinical mrsa isolates that were cultured under the same conditions.

sequencing of the agr operon
to determine how the structure of the agr locus influences the amount of tsst- <dig> secretion, we sequenced this region in strains  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which generated a tsst- <dig> concentration range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg/ml .

strain  <dig>  genome strain. strains  <dig> to  <dig> were randomly selected clinical mrsa isolates that were all tst-positive and assigned to agr class  <dig> by pcr. amounts of tsst- <dig> varied among strains and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> μg/ml.

a comparison of the nucleotide sequences from the  <dig> strains with the corresponding sequence of the agr class  <dig> reference strain s. aureus sa502a , revealed no relevant changes in the agrd and agrb regions, whereas  <dig> strains had allelic variations in the coding region of agrc, which is the receptor for two component regulatory systems. strain  <dig> had a point mutation at nucleotide position  <dig> of the coding region that replaced phenylalanine with isoleucine. strain  <dig> also had a point mutation at nucleotide position  <dig> of the coding region that replaced glutamine with histidine. strain  <dig> had a 9-nucleotide deletion  that resulted in the deletion of leucine, lysine and isoleucine. strain  <dig> had a nucleotide insertion that caused a frame-shift mutation, which in turn generated numerous stop codons. although both strains  <dig> and  <dig> produced large amounts of tsst- <dig>  the agr locus did not consistently vary in any way from that of the other strains . we also sequenced the promoter regions of the tst gene, sar  and the entire region of sigma factor b of these  <dig> strains. the sar is another positive regulatory locus for tsst- <dig> production that is required for maximal agr expression and sigma factor b is an important factor that feeds into the global regulatory network governing the expression of accessory genes  <cit> . no relevant nucleotide changes were evident in the sequences of both promoter regions of the tst gene and sar as well as the entire sigma factor b region .

data are from dna sequencing of agr loci, tst promoter region, sara and sigb from  <dig> strains. all mutations were found in agrc. nc, no change.

discussion
the proportion of tst-positive isolates among clinical mrsa isolates varies from < 20% to 90% according to country and clinical background  <cit> . the present study found that over 75% of clinical mrsa isolates carried the tst gene. this ratio is compatible with that of recent reports from japan and it is obviously higher than those of other countries  <cit> . the ratio of tst-positive isolates is increasing annually and thus it is important to understand how tsst- <dig> production is regulated.

the mere presence of a toxin gene does not mean that the protein will be expressed and if it is, toxin levels could widely from strain to strain. in fact, the quantity of panton-valentine leukocidin  produced in vitro varies up to 10-fold among mrsa strains  <cit> .

in the present study, we identified a 170-fold difference in the amount of tsst- <dig> produced among mrsa isolates by western blotting. expression of the tst gene is activated by agr so we sequenced the agr locus of various tsst- <dig> producers to determine whether it is associated with variations in tsst- <dig> production. allelic variations in the agrc region were identified irrespective of the amount of tsst- <dig> produced. one producer of a relatively large amount of tsst- <dig> had an insertion of nucleotides in the agrc that resulted in a frameshift, which in turn generated many stop codons. other strains had allelic variations that resulted in replacement of an amino acid irrespective of the amount of tsst- <dig> and a frameshift in the agrc of a high producer was predicted to generate truncated agrc. therefore, the agr locus is probably not functional with respect to tsst- <dig> production in those strains. recent findings have shown that about 25% of  <dig> human isolates are deficient in the production of delta-toxin, indicating that agr mediated regulation is disrupted  <cit> . these facts imply that mechanisms other than the agr locus are involved in tsst- <dig> production in our isolates. we also tried to evaluate tst gene expression by northern blotting, but the results were not reproducible, perhaps because of high levels of expression or difficulty in removing nuclease contamination. in addition, the sequences of both the promoter region of the tst gene and the entire sar locus were conserved among these strains, indicating that these regions are not associated with variations in the amount of tsst- <dig> production.

the previous and present results indicate that unknown transcriptional/translational regulatory systems control tsst- <dig> production or that multiple regulatory mechanisms are linked in a complex manner to synthesize and produce toxin. moreover, secretion mechanisms and proteolytic degradation would also be involved in the amount of tsst- <dig> produced.

a recent study has shown that variation in the amount of extracellular pvl does not correlate with the severity of infection  <cit> . in addition, pragman and schlievert noted that the transcriptional analysis of virulence regulators in animal models in vivo or in human infection do not correlate with transcriptional analysis accomplished in vitro  <cit> . from these viewpoints, further investigation is required to determine whether different amounts of tsst- <dig> are produced in vivo and if so, whether they are related to clinical symptoms of diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
the present results suggest that tsst- <dig> production is not directly associated with the agr structure, but is instead controlled by unknown transcriptional/translational regulatory systems, or synthesized by multiple regulatory mechanisms that are interlinked in a complex manner.
