BACKGROUND
ovulated mammalian oocytes are arrested at the metaphase ii  stage of meiosis and only complete meiosis after fertilization. the sperm is responsible for releasing the oocyte from its meiotic arrest, and also for inducing other events that are collectively referred to as oocyte activation. oocyte activation events include cortical granule exocytosis, reinitiation of meiosis, extrusion of the second polar body, formation of pronuclei, and recruitment of mrna  <cit> . in all mammalian species studied so far, oocyte activation is triggered by repetitive rises in the intracellular concentration of free ca2+   <cit> , a sufficient and indispensable event  <cit> . the i rises are generated by release of ca2+ from the intracellular stores, which is mediated by production of inositol  <dig> ,5-triphosphate  following activation of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway  <cit> .

it is hypothesized that upon fusion with the oocyte the sperm introduces a protein factor responsible for inducing production of ip <dig> and ca2+ release. a growing body of evidence suggests that the sperm factor is phospholipase c-zeta   <cit> . this plc variant is sperm specific  <cit>  and induces sperm-like i oscillations when injected into mouse oocytes  <cit> . injection of crna coding for plcz <dig> into mature mouse  <cit> , human  <cit> , and pig  <cit>  oocytes induces i oscillations and oocyte activation. in mouse sperm, plcz <dig> localizes to the postacrosomal region  <cit> , the area thought to first interact with the oocyte membrane  <cit> . functional studies using rnai to reduce the level of plcz <dig> in sperm showed that i oscillations were reduced after intracytoplasmic sperm injection  and a lower number of progeny was obtained after natural mating  <cit> . finally, in fractionation studies, the presence of immunoreactive plcz <dig> correlated with the ability of fractions to induce oocyte activation  <cit> , and immunodepletion of plcz <dig> from sperm extracts suppressed its i oscillation-inducing ability  <cit> . altogether, this evidence suggests that plcz <dig> is the factor responsible for oocyte activation in mammals.

plcz <dig>  like other plcs, catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidyl  <dig> -bisphosphate , producing ip <dig> and  <dig> -diacylglycerol . the elevation in ip <dig> concentration is responsible for inducing ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum , the ca2+ store of the cell, upon binding its cognate receptor, ip3r- <dig>  which is mostly located in this organelle. continuous production of ip <dig> is thought to underlie the persistence of the oscillations during mammalian fertilization  <cit> , and eventually lead to ip3r- <dig> degradation  <cit> . ip3r- <dig> downregulation, which is a hallmark of fertilization, is thought to contribute to the decreased responsiveness to ip <dig> observed after fertilization  <cit> . importantly, while plcz <dig> has been shown to trigger i oscillations, whether or not it is capable of inducing ip3r- <dig> degradation has not been previously reported.

parthenogenesis is the development of an embryo without paternal contribution  <cit> . when placed in the uterus of a surrogate mother, mammalian parthenogenetic embryos will develop to different stages depending on the species, but never to term  <cit> . bovine oocytes can be parthenogenetically activated using ionomycin, ionophore, ethanol, or electric stimuli  <cit> . all of these compounds will trigger a monotonic i increase that, while necessary, is not sufficient to completely downregulate the activity of maturation-promoting factor . to accomplish this goal, these i releasing agents must be used in combination with a protein synthesis or protein kinase inhibitor such as cycloheximide or 6-dimethylaminopurine , respectively  <cit> . using these activation protocols, parthenotes can reach the blastocyst stage at reasonable rates; however, the impact these treatments have on in vivo development has not been studied, mainly because parthenogenetic embryos are inherently limited in their developmental capacity.

in cattle, plcz <dig> is detected at the equatorial region of sperm  <cit> , and injection of mouse plcz <dig> crna induced i oscillations in bovine oocytes  <cit> . nevertheless, the potential of bovine plcz <dig> crna to induce i oscillations and parthenogenetic activation in homologous oocytes has not been reported.

in this study, we examined the calcium oscillation-inducing activity of mouse and bovine plcz <dig> crna when injected into bovine oocytes, as well as the effect of their injection on ip3r- <dig> concentration. we also compared the developmental rates of oocytes activated using mouse and bovine plcz <dig> crna to those observed following activation with commonly used chemical activation procedures. lastly, we compared the effect of the activation protocol on embryo ploidy.

RESULTS
validation of the intracytoplasmic injection technique for bovine oocytes
intracytoplasmic injections into bovine oocytes represent a challenge because of the high elasticity of the plasma membrane and the opacity and darkness of these oocytes. in this study, we adapted the technique used for icsi to inject consistent volumes of plcz <dig> crna into bovine mii oocytes. using this technique, we were able to inject a precise amount of media, confident of having penetrated the plasma membrane. to achieve this, a determined volume of media was loaded into a fluorinert-filled pipette using a hydraulic microinjector. then, the pipette was advanced into the oocyte up to about three-quarters of its diameter. by applying negative pressure, the oocyte cytoplasm was slowly aspirated. a well-defined meniscus was observed at the interface of the oocyte cytoplasm and the media when the plasma membrane was intact. when the plasma membrane was broken, the meniscus disappeared, and the flow of cytoplasm into the pipette was faster as a consequence of lower resistance. these indicators were used to determine that the membrane had been penetrated. then, applying positive pressure, the cytoplasm was injected back into the oocyte, followed by the media containing crna . the volume of media injected was controlled by observing the meniscus at the interface of media and fluorinert, guided by the reticulum present in the microscope's field of view . according to our measurements of the internal diameter of the pipette and the length of the injected column of media, we calculated that the injection volume would be ~ <dig> pl.

measuring the diameter of oil drops released in aqueous media, we calculated an injection volume of  <dig> ±  <dig>  pl  .

to corroborate the efficiency of the injection technique, we injected texas red dextran into the oocytes and then checked, under fluorescence excitation, the number of oocytes that had retained the dye. out of  <dig> attempted injections,  <dig> resulted in successful injection of oocytes with clear red fluorescence in their cytoplasm . subsequent activation of these oocytes – using ionomycin/dmap – induced parthenogenetic development at similar rates to noninjected controls . moreover, the fluorescence intensity observed in the oocytes was similar among injected oocytes, indicating that the volume of media injected was consistent from oocyte to oocyte . finally, parthenogenetically-activated  sham injected oocytes developed at similar rates than noninjected controls .

activation and parthenogenetic development of bovine oocytes injected with plcz <dig> crna
we have previously shown that injection of mplcz <dig>  crna into bovine oocytes induces long-lasting i oscillations  <cit> . however, in those studies, we did not investigate the ability of mplcz <dig> to induce oocyte activation or parthenogenetic development. in addition, whether or not injection of bplcz <dig>  crna could replicate the responses induced by bull sperm was not ascertained. to answer these pending questions, we first determined whether mplcz <dig> crna was able to induce oocyte activation, which was monitored by the extrusion of the second polar body. when bovine oocytes were injected  <dig> hours after the onset of maturation, extrusion of the second polar body was observed in all oocytes  within five hours of plcz <dig> crna injection. more importantly, rates of oocyte cleavage to the two-cell stage and pre-implantation embryo development to the blastocyst stage were comparable to those observed for oocytes activated by ionomycin/dmap . we next examined whether injection of bplcz <dig> crna was able to induce activation and embryo development in these oocytes. as shown in table  <dig> , bplcz <dig> effectively induced activation and embryo development to the blastocyst stage. we then investigated whether an association could be established between crna concentrations and high rates of pre-implantation embryo development. we first examined tenth dilutions of our crna stock, and then refined the concentrations to obtain maximum embryo development. among the concentrations tested, mplcz <dig> crna was most effective when used at concentrations ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> μg/μl , whereas bplcz <dig> crna was effective at concentrations nearly 5-fold lower . importantly, unlike mplcz <dig>  the highest concentrations of bplcz <dig> crna tested here had negative effects both on cleavage and blastocyst rates .

with the optimal concentrations of m and bplcz <dig> crnas determined, we investigated whether plcz <dig> crnas induced pre-implantation embryo development to the blastocyst stage at rates comparable to those induced by ivf and by frequently used parthenogenetic procedures. cleavage and blastocyst rates were similar among parthenogenetic embryos regardless of the activation method , and were higher than those achieved by ivf-derived embryos . also, parthenogenetically activated zygotes consistently cleaved to the two-cell stage at earlier times than ivf embryos . among parthenotes, a higher proportion of dmap-activated embryos had cleaved by  <dig> hours postactivation, but no differences were observed thereafter . collectively, our results show that injection of plcz <dig> crnas induces high rates of pre-implantation bovine embryo development.

injection of plcz <dig> crnas induces i oscillations and ip3r- <dig> down regulation in bovine oocytes
our previous finding that concentration and species-of-origin affect plcz <dig> crna's ability to induce embryo development suggests that the crna concentrations employed in this study might have produced specific i responses, as it is well established that too low or excessive i stimulation negatively impacts embryo development  <cit> . we therefore investigated the pattern of i oscillations induced by plcz <dig> crna injected at different concentrations. our results using mplcz <dig> extend our previous findings  <cit> , and show that sperm-like i oscillations are observed only during the first few hours gradually giving way to high frequency i oscillations, which likely reflects excessive protein accumulation . regarding bplcz <dig>  the lowest crna concentration tested , which promoted high rates of embryo development, induced oscillations similar to those triggered by  <dig> μg/μl mplcz <dig> and, accordingly, high frequency i oscillations  were observed by  <dig> to  <dig> hours post-crna injection . injection of  <dig> μg/μl bplcz <dig> crna induced i oscillations that transitioned into high frequency oscillations by ~ <dig> hours, and in all evaluated oocytes oscillations had ceased  <dig> hours after crna injection ; this cessation of i oscillations was not observed either with  <dig>  μg/μl bplcz <dig> or with  <dig> μg/μl mplcz <dig> crna.

fertilization-associated i oscillations are thought to be underlined by steady production of ip <dig>  <cit>  that leads to ip3r- <dig> down-regulation  <cit> . accordingly, we evaluated whether injection of plcz <dig> crna resulted in ip3r- <dig> degradation, and whether ip3r- <dig> down regulation was associated with plcz <dig> crna concentration and species-of-origin. we found that injections of  <dig>  μg/μl bplcz <dig> or  <dig> μg/μl mplcz <dig> crna induced fertilization-like ip3r- <dig> degradation , whereas injection of  <dig> μg/μl bplcz <dig> crna depleted ip3r- <dig> from oocytes ,

plcz <dig> crna-activated bovine embryos exhibit high degree of normal chromosomal composition
activation of development in oocytes of large domestic species in the absence of fertilization requires the successive application of a ca2+ ionophore followed by incubation for a few hours with a protein kinase or protein synthesis inhibitor  <cit> . while these treatments are highly effective at inducing pre-implantation embryo development, they cause high rates of chromosomal abnormalities  <cit> . given that we have shown that injection of plcz <dig> crnas dose-dependently induce high rates of parthenogenetic pre-implantation development, we asked whether a higher proportion of these embryos showed normal chromosomal composition. accordingly, we compared the chromosomal composition of eight-cell parthenogenetic embryos generated by injection of plcz <dig> crnas, versus that of embryos activated by two common chemical activation procedures, as well as of ivf-derived embryos . embryos generated using ionomycin/dmap showed the highest proportion of abnormal ploidy , while embryos activated using ionomycin/cycloheximide showed a modest amount of aneuploidy  and ivf-derived embryos the least . plcz <dig> crna-activated embryos exhibited the lowest percentage of aneuploid embryos  among the parthenogenetic treatments, although it was not significantly different than chx-activated embryos. these results demonstrate that injection of plcz <dig> crna is effective at inducing development of parthenogenetic embryos with high rates of normal chromosomal composition.

discussion
a growing body of evidence supports the view that oocyte activation during mammalian fertilization is triggered by the delivery of the sperm-specific plcz <dig>  <cit> . we show that expression of both m and bplcz <dig> in bovine oocytes induces high rates of oocyte activation and pre-implantation embryo development in vitro by initiating fertilization-like i oscillations in these oocytes. we also found that lower concentrations of bplcz <dig> than mplcz <dig> crna were required to induce i oscillations and high rates of parthenogenetic development. lastly, given the high proportion of normal chromosomal composition among embryos activated by injection of plcz <dig> crna, this procedure might be more desirable for inducing oocyte activation in assisted reproductive techniques such as scnt and icsi.

plcz <dig> and parthenogenetic development
our results show that a single injection of m or bplcz <dig> crna into bovine oocytes induces rates of oocyte activation and pre-implantation parthenogenetic development that are comparable to those observed after chemical activation. unlike the most commonly used chemical procedures, where the i rise induced by ionomycin is monotonic, and unable to persistently subdue mpf activity  <cit> , requiring the use of protein synthesis or protein kinase inhibitors to do so, injection of plcz <dig> crna alone is able to induce all events of oocyte activation. nonetheless, the effectiveness of plcz <dig> crna was dose-dependent, with either too low or too high of concentrations having detrimental effects on embryo development. thus, while plcz <dig> crna injection may require dose optimization for the species of interest, it may serve as an advantageous alternative to chemical activation protocols to induce parthenogenetic and scnt embryo development. because the normal fertilization i pattern can be closely replicated by injection of plcz <dig> crna, it would be possible to discern whether or not reprogramming defects commonly associated with nuclear transfer-cloning are related to aberrant i signaling. in addition, injection of plcz <dig> crna may also be useful to stimulate oocyte activation and embryo development following bovine icsi, given that this procedure is highly inefficient in this species with the inability of injected sperm to initiate i oscillations as one of the underlying problems  <cit> .

in the present study, cleavage rates and embryo development to the blastocyst stage were higher in parthenotes than in ivf-derived embryos. we speculate that because all oocytes used for parthenogenetic activation were denuded prior to activation, which allowed for selection based on the presence of a polar body and evenly granulated cytoplasm, a higher proportion of developmentally competent oocytes might have been selected for these procedures. conversely, ivf was performed in cumulus-enclosed oocytes, which might have resulted in fertilization of some immature or abnormal oocytes, which inherently have lower developmental competence. parthenogenetically activated embryos also cleaved earlier than ivf-derived embryos. we hypothesize that while in the case of parthenotes the time of activation is synchronized by ionomycin treatment or injection of plcz <dig> crna, sperm entry during ivf takes place within a period of  <dig> hours  <cit> . interestingly, within the parthenogenetic procedures, embryos activated with ionomycin/dmap cleaved earlier than those activated by ionomycin/cycloheximide. the basis for this difference remains unclear, although a more rapid decline in mpf and mapk is reportedly associated with the use of dmap  <cit> .

parthenogenetic procedures commonly used for bovine oocytes are associated with high rates of abnormal chromosome composition  <cit> . moreover, the frequency of aneuploid embryos was greater when dmap was used in the activation protocol  <cit> ; our study showed analogous results. importantly, injection of plcz <dig> crna effectively activated bovine oocytes without causing significant increase in the frequency of aneuploid embryos when compared to ivf-derived embryos, as only a quarter of plcz1-activated embryos were tetraploid, which is within the range of chromosomal abnormalities reportedly found in bovine ivf embryos   <cit> . it is worth noting that some tetraploid embryos may arise, at least in the case of plcz <dig> crna injection, as a result of the use of cytochalasin b, which is required to obtain diploidization of parthenogenetic zygotes; therefore, this complication is unlikely to be of concern if plcz <dig> crna were to be used in icsi procedures, which will not require the use of this drug.

plcz <dig> and i oscillations in bovine oocytes
here we show that injection of plcz <dig> crnas into bovine oocytes induced long-lasting i oscillations that were similar to those induced by the sperm in this species. the injection of the plcz <dig> crnas was directly responsible for the i responses, as i oscillations were precluded when plcz <dig> crna injection took place in the presence of cycloheximide , which inhibited crna translation. likewise, i oscillations were not observed when matured oocytes were injected with plcδ <dig> crna, a closely related family member .

in bovine oocytes, fertilization-associated i oscillations occur approximately every  <dig> minutes  <cit> , although variable i oscillations patterns were observed, with one to five i transients recorded during a 60-minute period  <cit> , possibly due to highly variable oocyte quality. injection of plcz <dig> crna into bovine oocytes nearly replicated the sperm-induced i oscillatory pattern, at least for the first few hours after injection. inevitably, and regardless of concentration and species of origin, the frequency of plcz1-induced oscillations increased, with oscillations occurring less than three minutes apart. this acceleration of oscillations likely reflects protein accumulation as a result of persistent translation of the crnas and it was most evident after the injection of high concentrations of bplcz <dig> crna. what it is more, in the latter case, oscillations ceased within six hours after the injection. the underlying mechanism responsible for the termination of the oscillations is not yet clear, although the major downregulation of ip3r- <dig> observed in these oocytes might be a contributing factor  <cit> . other factors, such as ip3r- <dig> dephosphorylation  <cit> , or endoplasmic reticulum reorganization  <cit>  cannot be discounted.

the crna concentrations that stimulated too low or too high i responses produced the lowest cleavage and developmental rates. these data are consistent with previous reports in the literature showing the regulatory role of i oscillations on the initiation and completion of oocyte activation events  <cit> . for example, it was shown that fewer number of i transients are required to initiate events of oocyte activation than what is required to complete these events  <cit> . it is therefore reasonable to speculate that the shorter duration of the i transients observed after injection of  <dig> μg/μl bplcz <dig> might have been insufficient to complete all the oocyte activation events. alternatively, the overwhelming stimulation of the phosphoinositide pathway under these conditions might have also negatively impacted cellular functions, thereby compromising embryo development. importantly, our observation that excessive i oscillations induced by injection of bplcz <dig> crna result in lower cleavage rates and embryo development is consistent with previous reports indicating that injection of high concentrations of plcz <dig> crnas into mouse oocytes had detrimental effects on embryo development  <cit> .

the observation that injection of plcz <dig> crnas efficiently induces ip3r- <dig> degradation in bovine oocytes is consistent with the notion that plcz1-initiated i oscillations involve the phosphoinositide pathway and ip <dig> production  <cit> , as ip3r- <dig> degradation requires ip <dig> binding to its receptor, followed by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the receptor  <cit> . it is worth noting that neither ca2+ release nor cell cycle progression induce ip3r- <dig> degradation in mammalian oocytes  <cit> .

injection of sperm preparations from a variety of mammalian species triggered fertilization-like i oscillations in oocytes from different species, suggesting that the sperm factor is not species-specific  <cit> . consistent with this view, injection of plcz <dig> crna coding for the human, simian, and mouse proteins induced i oscillations and parthenogenetic development of oocytes from non-homologous species  <cit> . here we extend those results and show that mplcz <dig> induces i oscillations and parthenogenetic development in bovine oocytes. lower bplcz <dig> crna concentrations were required to induce i oscillations and activation responses comparable to those induced by mplcz <dig> crna. moreover, the opposite response was observed when m and b plcz <dig> crnas were injected in mouse oocytes . there are several possibilities to explain the apparent higher specific activity of bplcz <dig> crna in our studies. the first possibility is that bplcz <dig> protein exhibits higher specific activity than mplcz <dig> in bovine oocytes, and this might be due to higher affinity for the endogenous substrate, or alternatively, because the distribution of bplcz <dig> protein more closely overlaps with that of its substrate. a second possibility that cannot be discounted is that species-specific differences in crna translation efficiency result in higher concentrations of bplcz <dig> protein than mplcz <dig> protein. although this is possible, we considered this possibility improbable as the used crnas coded only for the open reading frame, were produced under identical conditions and used the same backbone vector. regardless, additional in vivo and in vitro studies will be required to determine which of these possibilities is correct.

a previous study also compared the oscillatory activity of different plcz1s, but in mouse oocytes  <cit> . it was shown that human plcz <dig> was more effective at inducing i oscillations in mouse oocytes than simian or mouse plcz <dig>  <cit> . nevertheless, our data represents the first indication that some plcz <dig> may be more effective within species than across species. it will be interesting to determine if gene sequence differences among plcz1s from different species, which are mainly in the inter-domain regions, the linker region, may play any role in conferring species-specific adaptations. therefore, while the mechanism of initiation of i oscillations in mammals is highly conserved, adaptations may have occurred during evolution to carefully orchestrate the early events of oocyte activation, the appropriate conclusion of which will impact embryo development to term.

CONCLUSIONS
we show that injection of m and bplcz <dig> crna into bovine oocytes induces dose-dependent i oscillations, ip3r- <dig> downregulation and parthenogenetic development up to the blastocyst stage. in addition, plcz1-crna-activated embryos displayed low levels of aneuploidy. hence, plcz <dig> crna injection represents an effective tool to activate bovine oocytes and to study the impact of i oscillations on mammalian development.
