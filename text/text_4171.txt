BACKGROUND
pig is a major dietary protein source for human consumption and valuable model in agricultural and biomedical research , however, few studies concerning pig proteome were reported recently. with high-throughput technologies for protein profiling developing, great deal of molecular data will contribute to the understanding of pig early embryonic myogenesis. pig myogenesis is clearly a biphasic phenomenon with primary myofibers forming from  <dig> to  <dig> dpc, followed by secondary myofibers forming around each primary myofiber between  <dig> and  <dig> dpc  <cit> . the muscle growth is predominantly determined during prenatal skeletal muscle development .

skeletal muscle of postnatal pig consists of four major fiber types with type-specific expression of corresponding myosin heavy chain  isoforms and specific metabolic pattern, namely slow-oxidative type i, fast-oxidative type iia, fast oxidative-glycolytic type iix and fast-glycolytic iib  <cit> . slow oxidative type i myofibers are hypothesized to be beneficial for pork quality, while pse  pork is often associated with higher percentage of myhc iib fibers . although myofiber types are influenced by neuromuscular activity, mechanical loading, and hypothyroidism, myofiber composition is of high heritability in pigs  <cit> .

high-throughput and shotgun-based proteomic techniques are increasingly utilized to improve proteome coverage and produce protein catalogues  <cit> . itraq-mediated shotgun proteomics allows the relative quantification of peptides from eight samples simultaneously, and has proven to be a successful tool in protein biomarker discovery in biomedical field  <cit> . recent studies have reported  <dig> proteins in porcine muscle concerning gender and diet dephytinization by itraq  <cit> . in other livestock species, the analysis of bovine skeletal muscle by itraq identified changes in protein abundance between tender and tough meat from bovine longissimus thoracic muscle  <cit> .

with the goal to find out whether early embryo proteomic distinctions exist in pig breeds differing in meat quality and gain further insights into the mechanism.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> dpc embryos/fetuses of two pig breeds were employed: lr, an improved large pig breed, is characterized by high lean meat percentage, fast growing muscle and high body weight  <cit>  and wzs pig, originates from hainan island, china, is known for its superior meat quality, and is considered useful for medical research due to its small size   <cit> . the longissimus dorsi muscle proteome was analyzed by itraq. myofiber type characteristics were studied by real-time quantitative pcr and western blot . through these assays, we wanted to uncover the early embryo proteomic distinctions in two pig breeds and elucidate the mechanism underlying muscle development, which may contribute to the understanding of early embryonic myofiber formation in agricultural animals.

RESULTS

the largest amount of up or down-regulated proteins within wzs  and lr  were found in the comparison between  <dig> and  <dig> dpc , and morphologic observations also showed that myofibers didn’t appear until  <dig> dpc in both breeds . taken together, we deduced that 28– <dig> dpc is important for embryonic muscle development for pig breeds, during which a number of proteins participated in and the myofibers began to form. in the comparisons between lr and wzs at same stages, the largest number of up-regulated deps  were found at  <dig> dpc and the largest number of down-regulated deps  were at  <dig> dpc , which indicated that early development of wzs and lr embryos were distinctly regulated by more deps during this period than the other two stages. thus we speculated that 28– <dig> dpc is also important for embryonic development between breeds. significantly more deps were found in wzs at adjacent stages studied . over  <dig> myogenic terms  for biological process  were found significantly enriched in wzs and only two  were found significantly enriched in lr at adjacent stages , suggesting that distinct skeletal muscle development pattern has arisen at early embryonic stages between wzs and lr.

deps between wzs and lr at same stages
protein quantification based on the relative amounts of the different itraq labels was obtained for all the identified proteins with two or more unique peptides. the datasets for differences in protein levels between wzs and lr at same stages were analyzed then. the largest amount of deps were found in  <dig> dpc  . while at  <dig> and  <dig> dpc, smaller but still great amount of deps were present . the smallest amount of deps were found at  <dig> dpc .fig.  <dig> deps between wzs and lr at  <dig> stages. a venn diagram showing the number of total deps identified by ms/ms  between wzs and lr at  <dig> , <dig>  dpc. b significant deps identified in wzs and lr. different color represents different fold change



after analyzing common deps between wzs and lr at same stages,  <dig> significant deps were selected with  <dig> trends based on ratio of deps’ expression level  and go terms for bp were also analyzed in each trend : 1) proteins down-regulated at 21– <dig> dpc and up-regulated at 35– <dig> dpc ; involved go terms for bp: energy production/conversion, amino acid transport and metabolism, 2) proteins up-regulated at 21– <dig> dpc and down regulated at 35– <dig> dpc ; involved go terms for bp: signal transduction and dna-dependent transcription, 3) proteins down-regulated at 21– <dig> dpc ; involved go terms for bp: positive regulation of cell proliferation and dna integration, 4) proteins up-regulated at 21– <dig> dpc ; involved go terms for bp: coenzyme transport and metabolism and metabolic process .

myogenic deps between wzs and lr at same stages
in term of cog database, the function classification of identified protein sequences were listed . top myogenic go terms for bp with the minimal p values were chosen between wzs and lr at same stages, such as muscle system process, muscle cell differentiation and muscle fiber development, etc. the highest enrichment of myogenic bp were found at  <dig> dpc , six of which with p value less than  <dig>  . while at  <dig> dpc, lower enrichment of myogenic bp was present and only one term with p value less than  <dig> . at  <dig> and  <dig> dpc, no terms with p value less than  <dig>  were found.fig.  <dig> comparison of significant myogenic go and deps between lr and wzs. a comparison of significant muscle go biological processes between wzs and lr. we chose the lowest 4– <dig> p-value of myogenic go terms and converted them to the value of enrichment by calculating the absolute value of log <dig> at each stage. b comparison of significant muscle deps between lr and wzs. different color represents different fold change. myofibrillar proteins are marked red



from the proteins involved in the top  <dig> myogenic go terms for bp,  <dig> myogenic deps between wzs and lr were chosen  . taken together, most myogenic deps  were down-regulated at  <dig> or  <dig> dpc and up-regulated at  <dig> dpc, among which  <dig> myofibrillar proteins showed distinct expression pattern . only 3– <dig> myogenic deps were found at  <dig> and  <dig> dpc, while at stage  <dig> and  <dig> dpc, 9– <dig> myogenic deps were present .

myofiber type distinction at early embryonic stages
there are  <dig> myofibrillar proteins showing distinct expression between wzs and lr. in order to validate whether myofiber type distinction existed,  <dig> types of myhc isoforms were examined by qpcr and only myhci/iia were detected in wzs and lr. both of them were found with significantly higher expression in wzs covering  <dig> stages.

to further validate the distinction of myofiber development, myhci/ii proteins were detected by wb. the expression of myhcii protein was not detected until  <dig> dpc in both breeds, while myhci was first found in wzs at  <dig> dpc and expressed in both breeds at later stages. it’s interesting that both myhci and myhcii proteins were significantly higher expressed in wzs at  <dig> dpc, while until  <dig> dpc, myhci was higher expressed in lr . morphologic observations showed that myofibers didn’t appear until  <dig> dpc in both breeds and myofibers in wzs at 35– <dig> dpc tended to be larger in size and more in number than those in lr .fig.  <dig> validation of distinct embryonic myofiber type development between wzs and lr. a qpcr of myhci and myhciia in wzs and lr at  <dig> stages.* p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig>  . b wb of lr and wzs at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> dpc. gapdh was used as control. type ii and typei myhc protein was detected by anti-myosin  antibodies



taken together, at early embryonic stages, myofiber type distinction has been existed between two breeds and wzs showed stronger trend of myofiber differentiation during 35– <dig> dpc.

protein interaction networks of significantly deps
protein interactions were predicted in the website of string and the interaction network was illustrated by cytoscape software. there are two cycles in the figure . myofibrillar proteins are in the inner cycle; other proteins that were predicted to have interactions with inner cycle proteins are in the outer cycle. as predicted, several strong interactions were found between outer  and inner cycle myofibrillar proteins  . since most of the outer cycle proteins were up or down regulated at both  <dig> and  <dig> dpc, and most of the inner cycle proteins were up-regulated at  <dig> dpc and down-regulated at  <dig> dpc, it can be reasonably speculated that the outer cycle proteins regulate the expression profile of inner cycle proteins and the distinct expression of outer cycle proteins in wzs and lr may result in distinct characteristics of myofiber formation.fig.  <dig> interaction network of important myogenic proteins identified by itraq. protein interactions were predicted in the website of string and the interaction network were illustrated by cytoscape software. there are two cycles in the figure. myofibrillar proteins are in the inner cycle; other proteins predicted to have interactions with the inner cycle proteins are listed in the outer cycle. thicker line represents stronger interaction and bigger shape size represents that the protein may interact with more proteins. the strongest to lowest interaction level is marked by red to blue in shapes and lines. different forms of shape represent different expression trends in  <dig> and  <dig> dpc, which are listed in the figure



discussion
in this study, a comprehensive evaluation of proteomic profile in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpc of lr and wzs pig were performed, providing new data about distinctions in vivo during early embryonic muscle development. the results showed higher and earlier expression of type i/ii myhc proteins in wzs, which indicate distinct regulation network of early embryonic myofiber development between pig breeds differing in meat quality.

distinct muscle development pattern in wzs and lr
in this study, porcine embryonic longissimus dorsi muscle proteomic analysis covered the process of primary myofiber formation. in comparison of wzs and lr at adjacent stages, much more deps and significantly enriched myogenesis bp terms were found in wzs. in comparison between wzs and lr at same stages, although large amount of deps were found in  <dig> and  <dig> dpc, no significant myogenic go terms were found. while at  <dig> and  <dig> dpc, though the number of deps dropped significantly, higher enrichment of myogenic go terms were found. these findings indicated that 21– <dig> dpc may be important stages for the preparation of early muscle development and the deps involved in these stages probably participate in the distinct muscle development process between wzs and lr since  <dig> dpc.

distinct myofiber characteristics between wzs and lr
to further investigate the myogenic deps between wzs and lr, we analyzed the proteins involved in top myogenic go terms for bp. many myofibrillar proteins  are known to exist as multiple isoforms  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that some myofibrillar isoforms are differentially expressed in various muscles and fiber types. myosin makes up about one-third of the total muscle proteins and is known to produce multiple isoforms. different myosins involved in differentiate progress of distinct muscle fiber types: type i  , type iia  , and type iib/iix    <cit> .

in this study, multiple differentially expressed myosin proteins were found, among which myh <dig>  myl <dig>  myh <dig>  tnni <dig>  myl <dig>  tpm <dig>  tnni <dig> were up-regulated in wzs at least  <dig> stage we studied. in addition, mrna and protein level of myhci/ii isoforms also showed higher expression in wzs at all  <dig> stages. longissimus dorsi muscle is a fast-twitch glycolytic muscle involved in voluntary movements of the back. it was reported that faster growing commercial pig breeds with more muscle contain high proportions of type iib/iix glycolytic fibers   <cit> . no studies concerning wzs myofiber composition were reported, while previous studies indicated that skeletal muscles of meishan pig, another chinese indigenous pig breed, weighed only  <dig>  kg in average before mating  <cit> , comprises of higher proportion of slow fibers at slaughter, which was hypothesized to be the major attribute to the superior meat quality  <cit> . as we mentioned before, myofiber composition is of high heritability in pigs. previous study concerning later embryonic stages to adult pig shows that myofiber types at different stages and different part of the longissimus dorsi muscle have distinct composition of myofiber types  <cit> , while this study focused on the early embryo stages including primary myofiber formation. thus, we speculated that the myofiber type distinction began to show up between lr and wzs in early embryonic stages and changing through later developmental stages, which determined the distinct adult myofiber composition between lr and wzs.

deps involved in the regulatory network of early muscle development
several deps showed significant changes during these stages. csrp <dig> associates with meat quality traits with csrp <dig> and csrp <dig> in pigs  <cit> . this protein was down-regulated at  <dig> dpc and up-regulated at  <dig> dpc in wzs. h3f3a  dropped 74-96 % from 28– <dig> dpc but increased  <dig>  folds at  <dig> dpc in wzs. hepatoma-derived growth factor-related protein  <dig>  was up-regulated  <dig>  fold at  <dig> dpc and dropped 60 % at  <dig> dpc in wzs, and it includes an n-terminal pwwp domain that binds to methyl-lysine-containing histones, with specific binding of this protein to tri-methylated lysines  <dig> and  <dig> of histone h <dig>  and di- and tri-methylated lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig>  <cit> . it is reported that myoblast determination protein  determines cell fate and facilitates differentiation-dependent gene expression through chromodomain helicase dna binding protein  <dig>  -dependent deposition of h <dig>  at myogenic loci prior to differentiation  <cit> . recent study found that selective h <dig>  incorporation is essential for establishing specific modifications in myogenic genes, suggesting that the incorporation of specific histone h <dig> variants determines the lineage potential of myogenesis  <cit> . thus the distinct expression of h3f3a and hdgfrp were very likely to regulate the distinct early muscle development between wzs and lr.

several myofibrillar proteins and functional proteins involving in strong interaction networks were found by string analysis . for example, sri plays a role in the translation of mechanical cues applied to myofibers into paracrine signals, which in turn modulate satellite cell functions and support muscle growth  <cit> . it was down-regulated at  <dig> dpc and up-regulated at  <dig> dpc in wzs. casq <dig>  a calcium binding protein that stores calcium for muscle function  <cit> , was up-regulated since  <dig> dpc in wzs. the gene of otc was mapped closely to duchenne muscular dystrophy, which may play a role in myogenesis  <cit> . taken together, most myogenic deps were down-regulated at  <dig> or  <dig> dpc and up-regulated at  <dig> or  <dig> dpc in wzs, therefore, it’s reasonable to believe that these functional proteins participated in the regulatory network of distinct myofiber development process. in adult mice, a selective accumulation of myod transcript in the fast-twitch muscles and myogenin transcripts in the slow-twitch skeletal muscles suggests that fibre characteristics may be affected by the ratio of the different muscle regulatory factors  <cit> , but few studies about regulation mechanism of myofiber formation in agricultural animals are reported.

based on the above findings, further studies could focus on when and how the myogenic related factors differentially express between the two pig breeds in embryos. as in our study, the expression of h3f3a in lr was significantly higher than that in wzs  at  <dig> dpc. thus we speculate that this histone modification may play a key role in determining muscle development in embryos. as recent study shows that mice embryonic early skeletal muscle lineage potential is established through a selective incorporation of specific h <dig> variants that governs the balance of histone modifications  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this itraq-based early embryonic muscle study of wzs and lr showed that the distinction of myofiber characteristics began in the early embryonic stages, which probably result in distinct myofiber type composition after birth. our study contributes to the understanding of early embryonic myofiber formation and differentiation.
