BACKGROUND
the skin of terrestrial vertebrates evolved to prevent water loss and to provide a barrier between the organism and its environment  <cit> . in reptiles and birds, skin appendages such as claws, scales, beaks and feathers develop, and provide novel functions. these diverse epidermal structures are composed of beta  keratins, whose genes have been isolated from all major groups of reptiles including squamates, crocodilians, and chelonians  <cit> . to date β-keratin sequences are known for three crocodilian species, which are highly similar to avian β-keratins  <cit> . initial analysis of the chicken genome demonstrated that there are ~ <dig> avian β-keratins with a tandem array of  <dig> being located on microchromosome  <dig>  <cit> . recently, the feather subfamily of β-keratins has been located on multiple chromosomes in the chicken genome, yet the claw, feather-like, and scale β-keratins are restricted to microchromosome  <dig>  <cit> . glenn et al.  <cit>  isolated multiple copies of feather β-keratins from eight orders of the class aves, but they were unable to amplify sequences in the passeriforme order, which makes up over fifty percent of all living birds.

phenotypically the chicken has a larger body size and longer life span than the zebra finch. furthermore altricial birds like the zebra finch, hatch naked, blind, and nearly helpless and are dependent on their parents for survival. in contrast precocial birds, such as the chicken are generally well-developed, fully feathered and need little parental care  <cit> .

expression of chicken β-keratins
in the chicken four subfamilies  of β-keratin genes have been named in accordance with tissue specific expression and sequence heterogeneity  <cit> . however, during development of the epidermis and its appendages more than one subfamily may be expressed in a specific tissue . for example, the feather-like gene is not only expressed in feathers, but also in embryonic scales, and claw genes are expressed in embryonic feathers  <cit> . furthermore the scaleless  mutant chicken, which does not undergo scale and feather development, expresses β-keratins from all four subfamilies in its embryonic epidermis  <cit> . this embryonic epidermis is generated by the initial stem cell population of the embryonic ectoderm  <cit> .

the sequence annotation for each type of β-keratin gene  is listed in the left column. the expression level is indicated as plus  signs, with more plus signs signifying higher levels of expression. the tissue source and developmental stage is designate at the top of each column. an asterisk indicates that a positive reaction was seen with antiserum for that specific β-keratin sequence  <cit> .

as appendage morphogenesis and epidermal differentiation progress in normal birds, new epidermal stem cell lineages  differentiate and the expression of the β-keratin subfamilies becomes more restricted to specific appendages  <cit> .

interestingly, the four subfamilies of β-keratin genes form a cluster on microchromosome  <dig> , and form monophyletic groups  <cit> . in the case of the chicken, members of the feather subfamily are located on  <dig> different chromosomes in addition to gga <dig>  <cit> . although we have a genomic map of the β-keratins in the chicken, we are far from understanding how the individual genes in these specific β-keratin subfamilies are utilized to build all the epidermal appendages such as the beak, spur, egg tooth, lingual nail or the numerous types of feathers  <cit> .

in addition to the four subfamilies of β-keratins, two novel β-keratins have also been identified in separate experimental approaches; one from serially cultured chicken keratinocytes  <cit>  and another from jun-transformed quail fibroblasts  <cit> .

structure of the β-keratin protein
feather β-keratins are fibrous proteins that have four repeating units of two β-sheets that form a helical structure. this structure is surrounded by a matrix that makes up the filament-matrix texture that is seen in the structure of feathers. fraser and parry  <cit>  found through x-ray diffraction studies that a  <dig> amino acid segment, of the total  <dig> amino acids that comprise the feather β-keratin coding region, makes up the 2- <dig> nm filament and that the remaining residues comprise the matrix . this is in contrast to the alpha -keratins , which have a coiled coil α-helix structure and have associated amorphous proteins  <cit> . based on sequence similarity, this  <dig> amino acid residue has also been identified in the β-keratins of scales and claws from reptiles and birds in addition to the chicken, suggesting that it is an important region and should be under intense purifying selection.

gene duplication
evolution of multigene families is believed to occur through gene duplication. duplication is relatively common and occurs by several methods, including unequal crossing over, gene conversion, and transposition by genomic elements.  <cit> . unequal crossing over and gene conversion are often linked to tandem duplication, which results in arrays of similar regions of dna. transpositions are the result of transposable elements and can result in tandem duplication or the duplication of genes to other loci in a genome or species  <cit> . lynch et al.  <cit>  points out three possible outcomes of gene duplication: non-functionalization, in which one gene is silenced; neo-functionalization, where one of the copies acquires a new function; and sub-functionalization, in which case both copies become partially compromised  <cit> . it has been proposed that the feather β-keratin subfamily evolved from the scale β-keratin subfamily through a deletion event followed by gene duplication  <cit> , but other authors suggest that the feather genes are basal to the avian scale genes  <cit> .

genomic organization of β-keratins in gallus gallus domesticus
in the white leghorn chicken , a genomic region spanning ~ <dig> kb containing the claw, feather, and feather-like subfamilies of the β-keratin multigene family was described by presland et al  <cit>  . this region was reconstructed from a chicken cosmid library and a feather probe was used to identify β-keratins. the library revealed  <dig> claw β-keratins,  <dig> feather β-keratins, and  <dig> feather-like β-keratins in this 5' to 3' order, respectively. the scale β-keratins were not mapped in that study.

the genomes of gallus gallus and taeniopygia guttata have been sequenced to a  <dig>  x coverage and a  <dig>  x coverage respectfully  <cit> . the g. gallus genome was the first avian genome to be sequenced and recently the  <dig>  build has been released. with information about β-keratin genes in the chicken  <cit>  and the recent publication of the zebra finch genome, an in depth comparison of avian β-keratin genes and their molecular evolution is now possible in these species which differ phenotypically and are separated by ~87-111mya  <cit> .

RESULTS
we have identified a total of  <dig> complete β-keratin gene sequences  in the g. gallus genome  <cit> , which are distributed on three macrochromosomes , one intermediate chromosome , two microchromosomes , and "chromosome unknown"    <cit> . in the genome of t. guttata a total of  <dig> β-keratin genes are located on one macrochromosome , two microchromosomes , and "chromosome unknown" . we also identified the number of probable genes and pseudogenes in each subfamily of β-keratin found in both genomes. these probable genes contain reasonable stop and start codons, no in-frame stop codons, no frame shift mutations, or regions of unknown genomic sequence, and they meet stringent e-values .

comparison of the number of β-keratin coding regions found on each chromosome of both g. gallus and t. guttata. the identification of each probable  gene is based on highest similarity to the cdna nucleotide sequences listed in table  <dig>  all blast hits that failed to meet the stringent standards were determined to be pseudogenes  .

gi: <dig> 
gi:  <dig> 
query sequences used in blast searches and the ncbi gi number or publication where these sequences can be located. the lowest and highest  e-value, the highest and lowest  blast score for identification of β-keratin sequences on gga <dig> and tgu <dig> are listed. these sequences were also used to search the entire genomes of both g. gallus and t. guttata using an e-value cut-off of 1e- <dig> for those searches involving additional feather β-keratins  <cit> .

molecular phylogeny
the molecular phylogeny of  <dig> probable avian β-keratin sequences, using crocodilian β-keratin genes as the outgroup demonstrates that the avian scale β-keratins are the basal group in birds . the β-keratin from cultured chicken keratinocytes, found only on gga_ <dig>  is basal to the avian scale; however its expression in normal tissues in vivo has not been shown. the avian claw genes are basal to the feather genes, and the claw and scale genes are monophyletic, and form sister groups between chicken and zebra finch.

the feather genes on macrochromosome  <dig> form a monophyletic group and form sister groups between the two species. twelve feather genes from tgu_un sorted out with the monophyletic group of tgu <dig> and  <dig> feather genes from gga_un sorted out with the monophyletic group of gga <dig>  the β-keratin genes on gga <dig>  identified as being similar to those isolated from jun-transformed fibroblasts form a paraphyletic group with the monophyletic group of feather genes on macrochromosome  <dig>  the monophyletic group of feather genes on gga <dig> , the monophyletic group of feather genes on tgu <dig>  and the feather-like genes on tgu <dig> and gga <dig>  except for the feather-like genes, all sister groups are monophyletic. these sister groups and the feather-like genes are basal to all of the feather genes on microchromosome  <dig> including those from "chromosome unknown". tgu27_clade  <dig> is basal to  <dig> other clades of tgu <dig> and  <dig> clades of gga <dig> feather β-keratins .

characterization and identification of β-keratins on microchromosome 25
microchromosome  <dig> of both species displays all four subfamilies. the gene order seen on microchromosome  <dig>  in a 5' to 3' direction, is claw, feather, feather-like, and scale . the overall size of the β-keratin cluster on microchromosome  <dig> varied between the two species with a base pair range of ~ <dig> kb and ~ <dig> kb for g. gallus and t. guttata respectfully. the chromosomal position of the β-keratin cluster differs for each species with the region on gga <dig> being ~ <dig> kb upstream from the β-keratin genomic cluster on tgu <dig> 

β-keratin from cultured keratinocytes
one β-keratin from cultured keratinocytes was identified in the genome of g. gallus. this one coding region was found ~ <dig> kb downstream of the scale β-keratins on the negative strand of gga <dig> . this β-keratin sequence has very low overall similarity to other avian β-keratins, but of particular interest is an approximate  <dig> amino acid region beginning at the twentieth amino acid of the keratinocyte β-keratin coding region that shows high similarity with other β-keratin family members. this region includes the  <dig> amino acids described by fraser and parry  <cit>  that make up the filament framework of β-keratins. several strong hits resulted from a blast search of the zebra finch genome, but these hits either lacked a reasonable stop codon or contained in frame stop codons.

scale β-keratins
the genomic location, orientation and number of the scale β-keratins on chromosome  <dig> of g. gallus and t. guttata share striking similarities. both species contain four scale β-keratin coding regions, which are downstream of the feather-like β-keratins on chromosome  <dig> . both have similar orientations of the scale β-keratins, with a negative and positive strand alternating pattern. the distance between the feather-like β-keratins and the scale β-keratins is  <dig>  and  <dig>  bps for g. gallus and t. guttata, respectively. the total distance covered by scale β-keratins on their respective chromosome  <dig> is shorter on g. gallus having an  <dig>  bp range and t. guttata having a  <dig>  bp range. a ~ <dig>  kb center to center distance is seen between both gga25_scale <dig> and 3; and gga25_scale <dig> and  <dig>  which are the coding regions found on the same strands. t. guttata lacks the conserved distance between sequences on the same strand, with tgu25_scale <dig> and  <dig> having ~ <dig> kb and tgu25_scale <dig> and  <dig> having ~ <dig> kb center to center distance.

claw β-keratins
while presland et al.  <cit>  found four claw genes in g. gallus domesticus; we have identified  <dig> complete genes in g. gallus. both lineages display positive and negative strand orientation. regular spacing of less than  <dig> kb is observed for the claw β-keratins in the galliformes. however, in g. gallus we removed three claw genes from the final dataset because they contained regions of unknown sequence or frame shift mutations and might be pseudogenes. two of these potential pseudogenes are located between gga25_claw <dig> and  <dig> with a negative and positive strand orientation, and a third is located on the positive strand between gga25_claw <dig> and  <dig>  the presence of these pseudogenes supports the view that the claw β-keratin genes have undergone duplication events  <cit> .

significant differences are seen between the claw β-keratin genes of g. gallus and t. guttata. gga <dig> contains eight claw genes while tgu <dig> only has one . the sequence similarity of tgu25_claw <dig> to the claw genes found in the chicken is rather low with only 49-55% identity observed from an amino acid alignment .

β-keratin in jun-transformed cells 
the only β-keratins found on gga <dig> were found to be highly similar to the β-keratin isolated from quail  fibroblast cells that were jun-transformed  <cit> . no significant blastn results were obtained from a search of the t. guttata genome, although the highest similarity was to tgu25_fl <dig>  the coding regions found in the g. gallus genome are tandemly arrayed on chromosome  <dig> with unequal spacing over a ~ <dig>  kb range and all having a length of  <dig> amino acids, which is consistent with the cdna of c. japonica. these coding regions have the highest similarity to feather-like β-keratins at  <dig> % in an alignment with all subfamilies of the multigene β-keratin family . a nucleotide alignment  shows that the three bkj coding regions only differ by one or two nucleotide changes and therefore have a greater than 99% identity between the three sequences.

feather β-keratins on macrochromosome 2
chicken macrochromosome  <dig> has five complete coding regions spanning ~ <dig>  kb and in contrast tgu <dig> has twenty-two feather β-keratins located in a region spanning ~ <dig> kb . the molecular phylogeny demonstrates that additional feather genes similar to those on macrochromosome  <dig> may be found on chromosome unknown of both species . five feather genes on gga_un sort with the feather genes found on gga <dig> and have not yet been placed in the current build of the chicken. additionally,  <dig> feather genes from tgu_un sort with those on tgu <dig> making the total number of genes on tgu <dig>  <dig> 

feather-like β-keratins
there are  <dig> feather-like β-keratin genes on microchromosome  <dig> of g. gallus , while g. gallus domesticus contains three feather-like coding regions  <cit> , as seen in t. guttata. feather-like pseudogenes were found on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in g. gallus. no additional feather-like genes were found outside of tgu <dig> in the zebra finch.

feather β-keratins on microchromosome 25
we found  <dig> feather β-keratin genes on microchromosome  <dig> of g. gallus, which is in contrast to the  <dig> identified by presland et al  <cit>  for g. gallus domesticus. all  <dig> coding regions are found on the positive strand and have equal spacing of ~ <dig> kb in agreement with presland et al  <cit>  . a large gap is seen in the feather β-keratin region on gga <dig>  which is located between gga25_fk <dig> and  <dig>  a pseudogene is present here, but was excluded from our data because it contains a frame shift mutation. this type of mutation is evidence of a duplication event and in an array of genes indicates that some of these genes are the product of tandem duplication  <cit> .

only two feather coding regions are located on microchromosome  <dig> of t. guttata and they have a negative and positive strand orientation with approximately  <dig>  kb separating the two genes .

feather β-keratins on gga <dig> and 5
both avian genomes contain coding regions at other loci with high similarity to the feather β-keratins found on chromosome  <dig>  all loci outside of chromosome  <dig> have tandem arrays with the exception of gga <dig> and gga <dig>  both of these loci contain one feather β-keratin coding region.

the molecular phylogeny  shows that the sequence on macrochromosome  <dig> sorts with the feather β-keratins of gga <dig>  similar to the relationship of gga <dig> and gga <dig> is that of gga5_fk <dig> with its paralogues on gga27_clade <dig> . in fact, the single feather β-keratin sequence on gga <dig> has a very high similarity to gga27_fk <dig> with only one synonymous substitution .

feather β-keratins on microchromosome 27
both species have the largest number of β-keratins with the greatest similarity to feather keratins on microchromosome  <dig>  a tandem array of  <dig> coding sequences is located on gga <dig>  in which  <dig> are found on the negative strand toward the 3' end of the cluster . the remaining  <dig> are found on the positive strand. tgu <dig> has two tandem arrays totaling  <dig> feather β-keratins. the array farthest downstream in the 3' direction has a similar orientation to that of gga <dig> , but has a reduced number of coding regions. unique to tgu <dig> is a second array found ~ <dig>  kb upstream, containing eleven coding regions.

analysis of selection acting on the feather β-keratins
fraser and parry, through x-ray diffraction studies, described the structure of the feather molecule. the central region,  <dig> amino acids of the total  <dig> amino acid protein, forms the filament with the remaining amino acids comprising the matrix   <cit> . we hypothesize that the filament region should be under purifying selection for the proper formation of feathers. in order to determine whether the large numbers of feather β-keratin genes found throughout the avian genome are actively transcribed for feather formation, the filament region was analyzed at the amino acid level by determining the individual dn/ds ratio.

the paml program was used to analyze each chromosomal locus separately that consists of more than two feather genes . the only significant results for high dn/ds ratios at individual amino acid sites in the filament region, using the paml program, were found at sites  <dig> and  <dig> of the feather genes on gga <dig>  however, the likelihood ratio tests  to determine the fit of the models, using four separate tests , to the data did not significantly differ from the chi-squared value , indicating a false positive result. this result may be due to the low number of feather genes analyzed on gga <dig> .

expression of β-keratins
the expressed sequence tag  databases for the chicken and zebra finch were downloaded via ncbi and contained  <dig>  and  <dig>  sequences, respectably. seventy chicken est sequences were found to be highly similar to β-keratin sequences found in the genome of g. gallus . these results include a total of forty-three separate chicken β-keratin genomic sequences, which consists of feather β-keratin sequences found on gga <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and all clades of gga <dig>  and claw, scale, and keratinocyte β-keratin sequences of gga <dig>  thus, genes of feather β-keratins are expressed from all major clades . however, the tissue sources of the chicken est data are extremely diverse; ovaries, testes, eye, fat, spleen, breast muscle, and various other glands. the only significant result for the β-keratin sequences of t. guttata was to the tgu2_fk <dig> sequence, in which the resulting est only covered the first  <dig> nucleotides of the  <dig> base pair sequence with 98% similarity. the majority of the t. guttata ests are from brain tissues .

gene conversion
in order to investigate occurrences of gene conversion and/or unequal crossing over, the program geneconv was used to analyze all  <dig> β-keratin genes in this data set . the main questions addressed here were: are the β-keratin subfamilies  formed through unequal crossing over and subsequent divergence, and did gene conversion play a significant role in the homogenization of the these subfamilies in the avian genome  <cit> ? seven fragments in our data set were found to be statistically significant and support the view that unequal crossing over has occurred on gga <dig>  five of these fragments, which are  <dig> nucleotides long, were found between gga25_claw <dig> and gga25_fk <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  two were between gga25_fl <dig> andgga25_fk <dig> and  <dig> and were  <dig> nucleotides long. these seven fragments demonstrate that the feather and feather-like β-keratins on gga <dig> were formed through unequal crossing over. in contrast, a fragment of  <dig> nucleotides was found between two tgu_un feather genes, which demonstrates homogenization of the feather β-keratins in the zebra finch.

discussion
genome assembly
the actual number of β-keratin genes at any locus may not be correct because diploid genomes may contain mis-assembled contigs that result from allelic variation  <cit> . this variation is often localized to "chromosome unknown", but may occur when a second allelic copy is inserted next to a sister copy on a chromosome, which results in an apparent duplication of the gene or sequence  <cit> . in fact, the loci containing β-keratins are made up of several separate contigs. for example the genomic contig that contains the feather β-keratin clades of gga <dig> consists of  <dig> separate contigs . therefore conclusions in this study rely more heavily on phylogenetic results  than on the actual number of β-keratin genes. the est data in combination with molecular phylogenies demonstrate that the β-keratin multigene family does consist of multiple clades of feather β-keratins found on many loci throughout the genomes of the chicken and zebra finch.

each genomic contig that contains at least two β-keratin sequences are listed according to their ncbi gi number. for each genomic contig the total number of nucleotides, the range of nucleotides that is covered on their respective chromosome, the number of contigs, and the estimated gap lengths based on linkage maps for each species is listed. in the case of zebra finch, each gap consisted of  <dig> unknown nucleotides.

in the case of g. gallus microchromosome  <dig>  a similar number of β-keratin genes from three subfamilies  with the same genomic organization was observed in g. gallus domesticus by presland et al.  <cit> . they  <cit>  reconstructed this region from a chicken cosmid library using restriction enzymes to map the ~ <dig> kb genomic fragments . comparison of this region with the region we have identified on gga <dig>  indicates that this region of the chicken genome build  <dig>  is of high quality.

molecular phylogeny
a comparison of the trees generated by the neighbor-joining method  and the maximum likelihood method  shows that generally the maximum likelihood has more conservative bootstrap values. although the maximum likelihood phylogeny shows that the claw and scale β-keratin genes are monophyletic it does not support the paraphyletic grouping by species. furthermore, the bootstrap support for tgu <dig> clade  <dig> being monophyletic and the basal group for the other feather β-keratin genes on microchromosome  <dig> is very weak. gga <dig> clade  <dig> and  <dig> also lack strong bootstrap support for their monophyly. overall the trees are very similar, but the low bootstrap support from maximum likelihood analysis may reflect the high similarity  within the subfamilies of β-keratins and the robustness of this method.

expression of β-keratins and phenotypic variation between the chicken and zebra finch
studies of protein expression using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis have demonstrated that overlap exists between the proteins expressed by the claw, egg tooth, beak and scale from 19- <dig> day chick embryos . these tissues express different levels of β-keratins. for example, the scale and beak express at least  <dig> different β-keratins and several phosphorylated β-keratins, while the egg tooth and claw have significantly reduced levels of two of these β-keratins and two phosphorylated β-keratins  <cit> . the beak, scale and claw tissues display very similar expression patterns for their β-keratins on two-dimensional gels . these data suggest that not only do the scale epidermal cells express scale β-keratin genes but they also express β-keratin genes from other subfamilies such as claw. furthermore, some β-keratin genes are expressed at the same level in multiple epidermal appendages , while others are expressed at significantly reduced levels  <cit> . interestingly, we have found that the gene isolated from embryonic chicken beak  has 97% identity with gga25_claw <dig>  further demonstrating that the beak epidermis expresses the claw subfamily of β-keratins.

no information is available on the expression of β-keratins in the claws or beaks of passeriformes. it may be that the single claw gene  in the zebra finch genome is expressed in both structures. however, a recent study of claw development in the zebra finch suggests that the zebra finch claw is a modified scale  <cit> . perhaps the zebra finch claw epidermis uses β-keratins from the scale subfamily and/or other subfamilies for its cornification. furthermore since the beaks of chickens express both scale and claw genes , perhaps the beaks of passeriformes express mainly scale β-keratins  <cit> .

passeriformes are altricial birds  <cit> , and are mostly naked when they hatch. in the zebra finch a few embryonic feather filaments are scattered over the body of the hatchling  <cit> . assuming that the number of genes on microchromosome  <dig> is correct for the chicken and zebra finch, the differences in the number of feather β-keratin genes on microchromosome  <dig> for these two species may be related to the altricial nature of passeriformes. studies do demonstrate that the feather β-keratin genes on gga <dig> are expressed in developing feathers  <cit> . if the feather genes on microchromosome  <dig> are used mainly to produce the structural proteins for the embryonic down feathers, then the demand for multiple copies of feather genes  <cit>  may be relaxed in altricial birds.

recombination
the results of the gene conversion test  suggest that the feather genes on microchromosome  <dig> arose through unequal crossing over from either the claw or feather-like genes or both. an alternative hypothesis is that the claw genes, through unequal crossing over, gave rise to the feather genes which in turn gave rise to the feather-like genes found on gga <dig>  these results indicate that many episodes of recombination have occurred on gga <dig> and that gene conversion may be very rare among β-keratin sequences. in fact, the only results that indicate gene conversion are between two feather β-keratin genes found on tgu_un.

the high number of genes found for the clades on microchromosome  <dig> in both species may be due to the high rate of recombination seen on avian microchromosomes. the negative correlation between recombination and chromosome size, results in a higher gene density on microchromosomes  <cit> . the high number of feather β-keratins on tgu <dig> may relate to the high rate of recombination that occurs toward the ends of the macrochromosomes in the zebra finch genome  <cit> .

implications for evolution of avian genomes
recently, hu et al.  <cit>  described a small, crow-sized theropod, anchiornis huxleyi, dated to ~155mya, with long pennaceous feathers on its forelimbs and hindlimbs. they point out that large pennaceous feathers located on the hind limb is a feature known for the basal members of the three major paravian groups . hu et al.  <cit>  further proposes that feathering of the foot was a critical step in the evolution of birds . since numerous studies demonstrate that adult feathers are made of feather β-keratins  <cit> , it is reasonable to assume that the feather and/or feather-like β-keratins were present in the pennaceous feathers on anchiornis and other paraves. considered in light of our phylogenetic analyses of the β-keratin subfamilies, the presence of pennaceous feathers on anchiornis supports the view that a β-keratin multigene cluster similar to that seen on microchromosome  <dig> in today's birds may have existed in archosaurians as early as the middle jurassic  <cit>  .

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest the following scenario for the evolution of the β-keratin gene family . the genome of early archosaurians contained a cluster of β-keratin genes, closely related to the scale β-keratin genes seen in today's crocodilians and birds  <cit> . duplication and diversification lead to the subfamily known as claw, which provided additional building blocks for the evolution of archosaurian appendages; i. e., claws, beaks, spurs, etc  <cit> . in fact, members of both the scale and claw subfamilies of β-keratin are present in developing claws, beaks, scales, and even feathers of birds   <cit> . as the development and morphogenesis of the epidermal appendages diversified further, recombination in the β-keratin gene cluster provided the raw material for the evolution of new β-keratin genes, such as feather and feather-like, which would eventually provide the structural proteins for appendages with novel functions, such as the feather. in fact, our molecular phylogenies demonstrate that the avian claw genes evolved from the scale genes, and form a basal group to the feather-like and feather genes .
