BACKGROUND
promoter sequences have been described as a vast and largely uncharted territory for evolutionary biologists  <cit> . one impediment to exploration is the difficulty of motif prediction in noncoding sequences : motif-discovery tools achieved detection rates of only 22–35% for transcription factor  binding sites in recent benchmark studies  <cit> . although it has long been recognized in principle  <cit>  that evidence for motifs can be enhanced by comparing sequences of common ancestry, 'phylogenetic footprinting' of higher eukaryotes is still in a development and evaluation phase  <cit> . there are also perceived challenges in the use of sequence alignment for phylogenetic analysis of ncs  <cit> , as complex mutational processes  are prevalent. in practice, however, bremer et al.  <cit>  found chloroplast ncs to be of similar utility to coding sequences in phylogenetic tree construction for asterids. this result confirmed that plant ncs contain evolutionary signal, which might be hypothesized to reside in the conserved motifs sought in phylogenetic footprinting. the present study sought to explore the extent to which phylogenetic footprints in plant 5'-ncs could be subjected to evolutionary analysis and interpretation. for this objective, we needed to conduct sufficiently comprehensive phylogenetic footprinting for meaningful evolutionary analysis of conserved sequence blocks.

we employed a greater taxonomic range than other phylogenetic footprinting studies of plant ncs, which have been confined to single families  <cit>  or to a couple of species  <cit> . much of the interest in promoter evolution lies in comparisons of paralogous genes . in consequence, it must be noted, our dataset included several multigene families, and therefore was not optimized to investigate taxonomic phylogenies in the manner of bremer et al.  <cit> .

recognizing limitations in individual motif discovery tools  <cit> , we sought to maximize detection of conservation by combining distinct methodologies. analysis of generalized lempel-ziv complexity , played several roles in our study. clz measures the complexity of a text as the minimal number of steps in a defined procedure of its synthesis with the parsing rule: the next phrase is the longest seen previously. many text compression algorithms are based on lempel-ziv parsing  <cit> . computation of clz thus involves a decomposition of the text into repeated blocks, and an application to the discovery of structural regularities in genetic 'texts' was realized by gusev et al.  <cit> . this method has identified arrays of conserved sequence blocks in ncs of vertebrates from fish to humans  <cit> . clz analysis has also been used to study human mutagenic mechanisms  <cit>  and genomic architecture  <cit> .

our second tool was motif sampler, in which the probability of finding a particular motif is estimated using gibbs sampling and modelling of the background sequence with a markov model  <cit> .

we complemented these tools with sequence alignment, including the dialign and align-m algorithms designed for highly divergent sequences with only localized similarities, as seen in 5'-ncs. dialign is based on a segment-to-segment comparison  <cit> , while align-m uses a non-progressive local approach to guide alignments  <cit> .

we focused on 5'-ncs of ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit  genes because of the exceptional corpus of knowledge against which analytical outcomes could be benchmarked. as the earliest nuclear protein-coding sequences in plants to be cloned, rbcs genes became paradigms for functional studies of plant promoters  <cit> , and several classes of cis-elements were originally defined in rbcs promoters. thus, the prototype of trihelix tfs was the nuclear protein gt- <dig>  which binds to the 14-bp box ii and related motifs in light-responsive regions of the pea rbcs-3a promoter  <cit> . box ii versions featured in the earliest rbcs promoter alignments  <cit> , and occur in other light-responsive genes  <cit> , where they may be targets of calcium/calmodulin phototransduction  <cit> .

two further cis-elements discovered in rbcs promoters, the g-box and i-box, are common features in light-responsive promoters  <cit> , and have been functionally characterized as dual components of a minimal light-responsive unit  <cit> . g-box binding factors , identified using tomato rbcs-3a upstream sequences  <cit> , are basic leucine zipper tfs interacting with the g-box core, cacgtg  <cit> . dicot rbcs g-boxes interact with the hy <dig> gbf, which mediates phytochrome and cryptochrome signals in concert with cop and det regulators  <cit> .

the i-box, core motif gataagr, was also defined in rbcs promoters  <cit> . its reverse, ycttatc, was highlighted in rbcs and other light-regulated promoters by early motif searches  <cit> . binding factors for the i-box are still being clarified. functional interactions occurred in yeast between i-box sequences and recombinant zinc-finger gata tfs from arabidopsis  <cit> . i-box binding nuclear proteins reported in several species  <cit>  may therefore include gata tfs, though the first cloned i-box binding protein was a tomato myb-like tf  <cit> . while the above rbcs cis-elements are the most studied, there is evidence for numerous further elements and dna-protein interactions in rbcs promoters  <cit> .

there is a particularly extensive history of characterization of rbcs promoters from pea, petunia and tomato  <cit> . we analyzed these along with other studied rbcs 5'-ncs such as those of arabidopsis  <cit>  to provide a gradation of taxonomic relations and evolutionary distances. conserved features shared by the plant families analyzed would have persisted since the cretaceous, to which can be dated the divergence of eurosids i  from eurosids ii , and both from asterids   <cit> .

RESULTS
phylogenetic footprinting
5'-ncs of up to  <dig> bp including proximal promoter and 5'-untranslated regions  were analyzed for  <dig> dicot rbcs genes. the rosid complement comprised all four arabidopsis genes , plus genes from brassica and the legumes phaseolus, medicago and pisum . the lycopersicon , solanum , petunia and nicotiana genes included representatives of all three solanaceous rbcs loci, which are distinguished by features including an extra  intron in 'locus 2' genes, and tandem duplicates at 'locus 3'  <cit> . phylogenetic footprinting analyses were performed on the entire dataset, and separately on various subgroups, e.g. rosid, brassica, legume, or solanaceous genes, or genes of each solanaceous locus. three methodologies were employed:

 clz analysis was used as proposed by gusev et al.  <cit>  to search for recurrent sequence blocks in the rbcs 5'-ncs. the clz measure is based on representation of a sequence by fragments that have been encountered before . let s = s <dig> ... sl be a nucleotide sequence of length l. denote by s  the substring of s that starts at position i and ends at position j. a lempel-ziv decomposition of s is a partition of s into m consecutive fragments, s = s  s ...s , such that the k-th component s  is the longest fragment downstream of position ik- <dig> for which an exact repeat has been encountered somewhere upstream of position ik-1+ <dig>  the number of fragments in the decomposition, clz  = m, is called the complexity of s with respect to direct repeats. for example, if s = tcgatcgagat, then the decomposition of s with respect to direct repeats is t-c-g-a-tcga-gat. fragments  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in this decomposition are of length one since respective nucleotides t, c, g and a occur for the first time. exact copies of fragments  <dig> and  <dig> occur in positions  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. the clz of the sequence with respect to direct repeats equals  <dig>  to find fragments repeated in different rbcs 5'-ncs, we concatenated multiple sequences for clz analysis.

 overrepresented motifs were sought with motif sampler, using a range of program options for prior probabilities, lengths, numbers and overlaps of motifs. motif sampler can also vary the background markov model order . thijs et al.  <cit>  found higher order models improved robustness of motif recovery in arabidopsis data. we found that the optimal markov model order differed for different motifs: in  <dig> repeat runs, optimal model orders were zero for detection of blocks  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  first for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  second for  <dig> and  <dig>  and third for  <dig> and  <dig>  

atypical instances . bplace database match; reverse-strand motif. *noted previously in rbcs genes: references in square brackets.

 sites of local congruence were sought in multiple sequence alignments produced by clustalw, align-m and dialign, with various gap penalty options for the first two. collation of methodologies by mapping output from clz and gibbs sampling analyses onto alignments yielded useful synergies. in particular, the alignments revealed arrays of blocks that occurred in several sequences in the same order, which increased confidence in less conserved block versions that occurred in the appropriate position relative to other blocks.

our initial clz procedure specified blocks ≥  <dig> bp with up to two mismatches, which identified  <dig> instances of  <dig> conserved blocks . relaxation of the mismatch criterion for dialign-aligned versions of these  <dig> clz-defined blocks exposed an additional  <dig> instances .

conversely, mapping blocks from other tools clarified often complex alignments. when the full dataset was aligned by dialign, 67% of aligned blocks split into an average  <dig>  fragments, and 86% of blocks were co-aligned on average with  <dig>  others. nonetheless, with support from clz and motif sampler,  <dig> instances of  <dig> blocks were identified within alignments. motif sampler used independently found  <dig> instances of  <dig> blocks.

the complementarity of our different phylogenetic footprinting methods was demonstrated by the benchmarking exercise in figure  <dig>  in this exercise, each tool independently analyzed the full set of  <dig> 5'-ncs, to test performance  in scoring each instance of the  <dig> most frequent blocks. performance parameters, following tompa et al.  <cit> , were:

 sensitivity = ntp/ 

 positive predictive value  = ntp/ 

where ntp = number of 'true' positives , nfn = 'false' negatives , and nfp = 'false' positives . 

clz analysis and motif sampler showed greater ppv in block prediction, but weaker sensitivities, than the best alignment methods . motif sampler's sensitivity for individual blocks correlated  with its log-likelihood statistic  <cit>  that is optimized during gibbs sampling. among the alignment tools, dialign and align-m, designed for highly divergent sequences with localized alignments, outperformed the clustalw global alignment algorithm . the performance of clustalw was significantly improved by reducing the gap penalties, though the ppv of dialign and align-m remained superior .

motif sampler outputs statistical data, which helped estimate the significance of our phylogenetic footprinting results. ten dummy datasets with different randomizations of every sequence were analyzed by motif sampler using background model orders 0– <dig>  randomization caused motif sampler to find on average  <dig> -fold fewer pseudo-motif instances. log-likelihood scores  <cit>  for pseudo-motifs in the  <dig> dummy datasets were much lower  than those of the original sequence motifs , which differed from random at significance levels of p <  <dig>  .

in summation, phylogenetic footprinting defined  <dig> conserved blocks, representing contiguous nucleotide sequences occurring in two or more rbcs 5'-ncs, and being of sufficient length, sequence fidelity and positional similarity to make their common evolutionary origin probable. a total of  <dig> instances of these blocks were identified in the dataset. a large majority  were supported by all three methodologies. of these  <dig> blocks, another  <dig> instances were supported only by clz and alignments, and  <dig> more only by clz and motif sampler. two other blocks  were defined using only motif sampler and alignments, and a single block  only by clz analysis.

conserved blocks
all block instances are mapped for the rosid  5'-ncs in figure  <dig>  and solanaceous 5'-ncs in figure  <dig>  an average of  <dig>  blocks were found in each gene. the blocks occurred in arrays whose relative order was absolutely conserved, so that the number-codes detailed in table  <dig> consistently reflect relative block positions from 5' to 3' in all sequences. we therefore confirmed observations of argüello-astorga and herrera-estrella  <cit>  on the existence in light-responsive plant promoters of 'conserved modular arrays' , which they defined as 'short promoter regions, including at least two different dna stretches larger than  <dig> bp , in which nucleotidic sequence, spacing, and position relative to the transcription start site are conserved in a phylogenetic series'.

over a third of blocks were conserved in two or more plant families, but the remainder were distinctive to single families, or, in the case of the solanaceous genes, to particular orthologous loci identified by dean et al.  <cit> .

blocks are listed in table  <dig> with 'definitions' as typical instances, since for variable blocks a consensus would be dominated by ambiguous iupac code. the degree of conservation of each instance relative to the 'definition' is indicated by the vertical block dimensions in figures  <dig> and 3; the 'definitions' were chosen to maximize these dimensions and do not necessarily represent importance in functional terms. full sequences and locations of all block instances are in additional file  <dig> 

the  <dig> blocks asterisked in table  <dig> have been recognized in past rbcs research. of these, the motif most represented was the i-box . the reverse-strand i-box  immediately upstream of the tata-box  was found by grob and stüber  <cit> , who termed it the light-responsive element .

the i-box block  <dig> functions in a light-responsive dual unit with the g-box block  <dig>  <cit> . the i-g boxes unit represented by blocks  was found to be common in light-responsive promoters, and termed rbcs-cma <dig> by argüello-astorga and herrera-estrella  <cit> . in rosid ncs, a second i-box downstream  occurred in an i-g-i boxes array postulated as ancestral by these authors. the tg-rich block  <dig>  between the g-box  and second i-box , formed part of rbcs-cma <dig> of argüello-astorga and herrera-estrella  <cit> . block  <dig> usually corresponded to motif  <dig> of manzara and gruissem  <cit>  .

in the present study, the largest cma found in all three plant families comprised blocks  <cit> , in dotted-line boxes in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  block  <dig> is a previously overlooked motif, but we found identical versions in similar relative locations in the caryophyllid genes mesembryanthemum crystallinum rbcs- <dig>  and spinacia oleracea rbcs- <dig> . in pea rbcs-3a, block  <dig> overlapped the 5' flank of the box iii* inverted gt- <dig> site  <cit> , and so might be a site for a factor like 3af <dig>  a light-regulated phosphoprotein that binds the 5' flank of the similar downstream box iii  <cit> . the pea rbcs-3a 3af <dig> and box iii sites themselves corresponded to legume-specific blocks  <dig> and  <dig>  which with block  <dig> are equivalent to rbcs-cma <dig> of argüello-astorga and herrera-estrella  <cit> .

block  <dig> coincided with the pea rbcs-3a box ii element, which is the prototype of gt- <dig> trihelix tf binding sites and a target of the calcium phototransduction pathway  <cit> . the variability of box ii-like motifs  <cit>  was reflected in the low motif sampler consensus score  <cit>  for block  <dig> , but this block was recognized by motif sampler with 85% sensitivity, and aligned in all dicot ncs by dialign and align-m on its relatively conserved tgtgg sub-fragment. the box ii motifs of earlier alignments  <cit>  corresponded to block  <dig> for most sequences, but to block  <dig> for tomato rbcs- <dig> and rbcs-3a. 

the solanaceous 5'-ncs  yielded further previously identified motifs, whose functions generally remain uncertain. blocks  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were components of rbcs-cma <dig>  <cit>  and identified by manzara et al.  <cit>  . likewise, the blocks  <dig> and  <dig> flanking rbcs-cma <dig> were found by manzara et al.  <cit>  .

on average,  <dig> % of the length of those sequences with known transcription start sites was occupied by 5'-utrs, though these were highly variable in extent . blocks 32– <dig> occurred in the proximities of transcription start sites. only two blocks,  <dig> and  <dig>  were located fully within 5'-utrs, but each featured in multiple sequences in several species .

precisely half the blocks in table  <dig> were newly identified in this study. these novel blocks were confined to single plant families, apart from the brassica blocks  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> also found in a legume species. in most of the novel blocks, potential cis-elements could be speculatively identified using promoter databases .

protein-dna interactions in tomato rbcs 5'-ncs have been extensively mapped by gruissem and colleagues, using dnase i footprinting of promoter fragments in nuclear extracts from different organs  <cit> . as shown for locus  <dig> , over 90% of our conserved blocks overlapped with dnase-protected regions in the 5'-ncs where these authors had defined dnase footprints for both dna strands. dnase-protected regions also included blocks  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  which have not been defined in past studies.

on the other hand, one-third of dnase-protected regions did not overlap with well defined blocks . these additional dnase-protected sequences tended to be very variable between genes and dominated by particular nucleotides . the latter feature can be formally translated as low complexity, as shown by the sliding-window profiles of clz  <cit>  with respect to the   alphabet in figure  <dig>  the association of dnase-protection with clz troughs implied functional roles for low-complexity regions.

one characterized mechanism for the introduction of at-richness  into an rbcs 5'-ncs sequence is the stowaway-le <dig> inverted repeat element in the tomato rbcs- <dig> sequence   <cit> . sliding-window clz profiles confirmed the stowaway-le <dig> sequence as one of the main low-complexity regions of the tomato rbcs- <dig> 5'-ncs . dnase-protected regions do occur within the stowaway-le <dig> sequence  <cit> .

evolutionary analysis
the absolutely conserved relative order of blocks indicated common ancestry of all the dicot 5'-ncs studied . this provided basic confirmation of the potential for evolutionary analysis of phylogenetic footprints, as these must share the evolutionary history of the plant taxa or gene loci with which they are associated. minimum ages for blocks found in different species were estimated by reference to molecular clock dates for relevant taxon divergences . for blocks common to paralogous loci, further evidence on minimum ages was available from recent studies of ancestral genome duplications . blanc et al.  <cit>  produced a database of  <dig> duplicate chromosome segment pairs in the arabidopsis genome, one of which  encompassed the ats1a and b genes. comparisons of synonymous substitutions  in the duplicate genes indicated the relevant polyploidy event was roughly twice as ancient as the brassica-arabidopsis divergence  <cit> . bowers et al.  <cit>  similarly identified a duplication event, prior to the brassica-arabidopsis split, that generated  <dig> chromosome segment pairs, of which their segment α  <dig> encompassed the ats1a and b genes.

within the duplicate segments containing the ats1a and b genes, the latter were among several examples of tandem arrays, others including lrk10l receptor-like ser/thr kinases  <cit> . such tandem arrays, presumed due to unequal crossing over, account for up to 17% of all arabidopsis genes  <cit> , but their age range is currently uncertain  <cit> .

in the solanaceae, a large-scale genome duplication was dated to 18– <dig> million years ago  from ks distributions of duplicate tomato and potato genes  <cit> . ks values for inter-locus comparisons of tomato rbcs coding sequences were consistent with formation of the  <dig> loci in this event . this must have occurred in a common ancestor, as ks values for tomato and potato rbcs orthologues  were consistent with the much more recent speciation date estimated at  <dig> – <dig>  mya by blanc and wolfe  <cit> .

estimated dates for major lineage divergences implied that  <dig> taxonomically widespread blocks were of cretaceous antiquity at least . these included the  <cit>  cma, block  <dig> , and blocks  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . another, block  <dig>  remains poorly characterized in functional terms, but does bind protein , and was further noted in genes from the amaranthaceae , and malvaceae . other cretaceous blocks were three rosid blocks  discovered in the present study. the remaining blocks were found only in single families but could be dated by clade divergence or gene duplication events to 18– <dig> mya .

the occurrence of particular phylogenetic footprints at different levels in the taxonomic hierarchy  indicated that the 5'-ncs might be amenable to phylogenetic analysis. opinions differ, however, about phylogenetic analysis of ncs, particularly at higher taxonomic levels. ncs are seen as problematic for alignment and phylogenetic analysis because of their structural constraints, non-randomness of evolution, and mutational changes such as slipped-strand mispairing, stem-loop secondary structure excision/repair, minute inversions, and intramolecular recombination  <cit> . in practice, however, bremer et al.  <cit>  found chloroplast ncs to be of similar utility to coding sequences for asterid phylogenetics.

in view of the technical uncertainties and limited precedents for exploring evolutionary relations between 5'-ncs  <cit> , we compared several distinct methodologies. first, given the role of clz analysis in our phylogenetic footprinting, comparison of the 5'-ncs based on this methodology was pertinent. a set of n sequences can be described in terms of their pairwise complexities, in the form of n vectors each containing n components. the  component is the pairwise clz with respect to direct repeats between sequences i and j. to some extent, pairwise clz measures an evolutionary distance between sequences by the number of steps required to produce sequence j from sequence i using it as a source of building blocks. hierarchical cluster analysis of 5'-ncs in this format produced the dendrogram in figure 7a. 

secondly, more conventional analyses based on dna parsimony or distance were applied to 5'-ncs aligned using dialign, or clustalw with the gap penalties found to be most effective in phylogenetic footprinting .  figure 7b shows a consensus of most-parsimonious trees of dialign-aligned 5'-ncs. 

our third method  was a cladistic analysis of character-states defined as presence or absence of conserved blocks. all blocks in figures  <dig>   <dig> were included: of these  <dig> % had ≥ 50% identity with the definitions in table  <dig>  the remainder averaged  <dig> % identity, and all but one had been found by three phylogenetic footprinting methods. close inspections of aligned locations scored as absences were often suggestive of degenerate residues of blocks.

several points of congruence between the dendrograms produced by these diverse analyses were identifiable, though bootstrap support for nodes was often moderate or weak . themes included the clustering of the 5'-ncs by gene loci rather than by species. thus, 5'-ncs of the arabidopsis atsb tandem locus showed more affinity with the brassica sequence than with arabidopsis ats1a. this accorded with the conclusion of bowers et al.  <cit>  that the ancestral α duplication event occurred prior to the brassica-arabidopsis split, because 49–64% of relevant brassica genes were more similar to one arabidopsis gene than was the arabidopsis duplicate.

another theme was the segregation of the solanaceous 5'-ncs as the three loci deduced by dean et al.  <cit>  . pairings of tomato and potato orthologues received particularly strong bootstrap support, consistent with a recent speciation  <cit> . in contrast, the coding sequences of tomato and potato locus <dig> instead segregated by species . similar discrepancies between noncoding- and coding-sequence trees in several organisms have been attributed to gene conversion processes that have a greater effect on coding sequences  <cit> . also consistent with gene conversion in the locus <dig> coding sequences were very low intralocus ks values that would imply tandem duplication near the tomato-potato speciation time , which would be hard to reconcile with the more ancient relationships of their 5'-ncs to petunia orthologues . gene conversion in the petunia locus  <dig> genes themselves was suggested by dean et al.  <cit> .

the locus  <dig> 5'-ncs presented a consistent picture in that the tomato and potato a genes were resolved as basal members of a monophyletic group . in fact, tomato rbcs-3a was the only gene retaining the ancestral  <cit>  cma in the analyzed region . the most likely counterpart among the petunia 5'-ncs analyzed was ssu11a . petunia ssu <dig>  ssu <dig> and ssu <dig> grouped with the more derived 5'-ncs of the tomato and potato b and c genes.

the remaining solanaceous 5'-ncs grouped into loci  <dig> and  <dig> . in evolutionary trees based on clustalw rather than dialign alignments, the petunia locus  <dig> gene ssu <dig> formed the outgroup to locus  <dig>  while the tomato and potato locus  <dig> genes grouped with the a genes of locus  <dig> . the dialign trees were preferred as they were supported by the alternative dendrograms, and because we rated the alignments from this algorithm most highly . moreover, clustalw alignments of transit peptides supported affinity of ssu <dig> with the other solanaceous locus  <dig> genes .

the basal solanaceous locus could not be confidently identified, as the basal position of locus  <dig> in two of the dendrograms in figure  <dig> had only moderate bootstrap support. clear guidance was not forthcoming from the coding sequence ks values , or from parsimony analyses , in which outgroup choice influenced topology with respect to these two loci.

discussion
conserved blocks revealed by phylogenetic footprinting in dicot rbcs 5'-ncs formed an evolutionary hierarchy, from those common to plant families that diverged in the cretaceous, to family-specific blocks with minimum estimated ages of only about  <dig> million years. similar heterogeneity in longevity and clade-specificity of promoter motifs has been found in other organisms of ancient divergence. among homologous human and rodent tf binding sites, for example, dermitzakis and clark  <cit>  found  <dig> with shared functions, while  <dig> were human-specific and  <dig> rodent-specific.

the most ancient conserved blocks we found included those recognized earliest in rbcs research on the basis of functional importance   <cit> , though several relatively unknown ones also fell in this category. furthermore, we were able to extend cmas postulated in previous studies  <cit> . younger blocks were generally of less widely recognized function, and presumably had acquired roles in the more recent clades in which they had evolved. simulations by stone and wray  <cit>  of the acquisition by point mutation of novel tf binding sites, and their subsequent fixation within populations, indicated the evolution of new sites must be virtually inevitable over millions of years. in a theoretical population of  <dig> arabidopsis plants with two generations per year, the fixation time for two 6-bp binding sites in a 200-bp region was only  <dig>  years.

evolutionary information in the 5'-ncs was sufficient for several formal computational methods to produce dendrograms in accordance with the existing classification of solanaceous rbcs loci based descriptively on sequence similarities, intron features and linkage relations  <cit> . the solanaceous locus  <dig> genes are distinguished as the only land plant rbcs genes with introns at three positions, while locus  <dig> is a distinctive tandem array of three 2-intron rbcs genes in tomato and potato, and probably six in petunia. gene duplications appear to have provided additional impetus in functional evolution of rbcs genes. for instance, the strongly expressed locus  <dig> tomato genes rbcs-3b and rbcs-3c  <cit>  represented the most derived members of tandem arrays according to our dendrograms. it has been suggested that gene duplicates are conserved and subfunctionalized by regulatory mutations, because each duplicate must survive to complement lost expression for essential subfunctions in the other  <cit> . duplicate gene preservation by such a process could be <  <dig> million years for a gene with ≥  <dig> regulatory elements and a mutation rate of 10- <dig> per year  <cit> . such a rapid preservation of duplicates may need to be invoked for locus  <dig>  because of coincident estimates  for the major ancestral genome duplication event  <cit>  and for divergence of the petunia clade  <cit> . in our dendrograms, segregation of petunia ssu <dig>  ssu <dig> and ssu <dig> with the more derived tomato and potato genes of locus  <dig> indicated that tandem duplications at locus  <dig> had occurred prior to the petunia divergence, and had undergone relatively little subsequent sequence evolution.

point mutations do not appear to have been the only evolutionary processes governing protein interactions in the rbcs 5'-ncs. mechanisms such as slipped-strand mispairing  <cit>  probably generated the relatively extensive and variable low-complexity tracts that coincided with known dnase footprints in the locus  <dig> tomato genes. another example of the gross mutational processes that can occur in 5'-ncs was the stowaway-le <dig> transposable element in the tomato rbcs- <dig> sequence . the absence of this transposable element from the potato sequence  <cit>  implies a recent insertion event in tomato.

a primary factor that facilitated our study was a suite of phylogenetic footprinting tools that complemented and cross-validated each other. the least known member of our toolkit was probably clz analysis, whose use deserves to increase with its availability as an internet tool  <cit> . its intuitive process of sequence decomposition by repeated fragments proved useful not only for identification of conserved motifs, but also for highlighting low-complexity regions such as at-rich tracts, and as a similarity measure for global sequence comparisons and hence dendogram construction. otu and sayood  <cit>  formally examined clz as a new sequence distance measure for phylogenetic tree construction, and demonstrated that its lack of dependence on alignments or evolutionary models was particularly suited for sequences subject to segment-based modifications, including whole mitochondrial genomes of eutherian mammals. promising alternative alignment-independent methods of sequence comparison have also been proposed using the general information theoretical concept of kolmogorov complexity  <cit> , of which clz is one explicitly computable implementation.

the dendrograms we produced using clz, and those obtained by parsimony analysis of dialign alignments or block characters, were of sufficient consistency to confirm the presence of evolutionary information in plant 5'-ncs. the dataset was not designed to investigate taxonomic phylogenies, as it included several multigene families. moreover, we would not claim that the dendrograms rival in quality those produced using coding sequences, as bootstrap support for nodes was often moderate or weak, and there were points of variance between the dendrograms. further investigation is needed to establish the extent to which ncs might contribute to molecular phylogenetics. we do, however, conclude that current computational methods provide the potential for analysis of the evolution of gene expression in terms of promoter structure.

CONCLUSIONS
comprehensive phylogenetic footprinting of dicot 5'-ncs revealed conserved modular arrays of recurrent sequence blocks. transcriptional functionality was confirmed as an evolutionary basis for this conservation by coincidence of recurrent blocks with cis-elements and protein-binding sites. evolutionary hierarchies were discernible within the assemblage of blocks, such that taxonomically widespread, and hence ancient, blocks could be distinguished from taxon-specific, more recent, ones.
