BACKGROUND
the analysis of dna methylation has become of considerable interest in biomedical research, as epigenetic studies have shown numerous associations between methylation levels and diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease . today, most research focuses on the cytosine-guanine dinucleotide  sites of the dna, which are the locations where methylation is primarily found in humans  <cit> . one of the most widely used techniques to measure dna methylation is the illumina infinium humanmethylation <dig> beadchip array, which covers approximately  <dig>  cpg sites. at each cpg site, methylation is quantified by the beta value b:=m/, where m> <dig> and u> <dig> denote the methylated and unmethylated signal intensities, respectively, measured by the illumina 450k array. the offset a≥ <dig> is usually set equal to  <dig> and is added to m+u to stabilize beta values when both m and u are small.

an important goal of methylation analysis is to identify dna regions where methylation is associated with disease status, lifestyle factors and other clinical or sociodemographic variables . this is often achieved by fitting site-wise regression models with dependent variable b and a vector of covariates x that may also include potential confounders. after model fitting, a common strategy is to carry out downstream hypothesis tests to identify those cpg sites that show significant associations between methylation status and the variables of interest.

because, by definition, b is bounded between  <dig> and  <dig>  gaussian regression with untransformed beta values is problematic in the context of dna methylation analysis. in particular, the variance of b is usually smaller near the boundaries than near the middle of the interval , implying that the homoscedasticity assumption in gaussian regression is violated . to address this problem, several modeling strategies have been developed, including gaussian regression with logit-transformed beta values  and generalized regression models for untransformed bounded responses, e.g. beta regression  <cit> . regarding the analysis of dna methylation, both strategies may become problematic: in case of m-value regression, the assumptions of a gaussian model are often not met despite the transformation of the data, and the interpretation of the coefficient estimates is only possible on the transformed scale but not on the original scale of b  <cit> . beta regression, on the other hand, requires the ratio m/ to follow a beta distribution, implicitly assuming that the variables m and u are independently gamma distributed  <cit> . while m and u can indeed be described by gamma distributed random variables  <cit> , the independence assumption for the two signal intensities is often not met in practice. for example, laird  <cit>  reported that the methylated and unmethylated signal intensities, as produced by the illumina 450k array, are usually positively correlated. the same finding was obtained from the analysis of the heinz nixdorf recall study data in the “results” section of this article. these issues, along with the results of two recent empirical studies  <cit> , suggest that more methodological research is needed to describe the distribution of b in a statistically sound way.

to address this problem, we propose a novel analysis technique for beta values that relaxes the independence assumption between the signal intensities m and u. the idea is to start with a model for the bivariate distribution of m and u and to derive the probability density function of the ratio m/. this function is subsequently used to construct the log-likelihood function of a generalized regression model that relates beta values to linear functions of the covariates. because estimation of the model parameters is based on the maximum likelihood principle, asymptotic confidence intervals and normally distributed test statistics can be derived by evaluating the inverse of the observed information matrix. this strategy allows for downstream hypothesis tests on the associations between a covariate of interest and the methylation status at individual cpg sites. for the rest of this article, we will refer to the proposed model as “rcg”  model.

using simulated data and a real sample of illumina 450k methylation data from the heinz nixdorf recall  cohort study  <cit> , we demonstrate that the proposed rcg model fits our data significantly better than beta regression and m-value regression . our numerical results further suggest that the rcg method may lead to an increased power of downstream tests on the association between methylation status and the covariates under consideration.

methods
in section “notation and definitions” we introduce basic notation and definitions. section “regression models for the analysis of beta values” briefly reviews beta regression and m-value regression and discusses the limitations of the two methods. in the section “a statistical model for the ratio of correlated gamma distributed random variables” the proposed rcg model for the analysis of beta values is derived. section “estimation and hypothesis tests” provides details on model fitting and on the construction of downstream hypothesis tests.

notation and definitions
at each cpg site, the illumina 450k array produces a sample of methylated and unmethylated signal intensities i= <dig> …,n, where n is the number of analyzed persons. the corresponding set of beta values is calculated by b
i=m
i/, i= <dig> …,n. to facilitate the derivation of distributional results, we will set a= <dig> throughout this section. the predictor variable of interest and the confounding variables are collected in vectors x
i=⊤, i= <dig> …,n. for each cpg site, the aim is to analyze the associations between the variables in x and the methylation status b.

following  <cit>  and  <cit> , we assume that the stochastic behavior of the signal intensities m and u can be described by gamma distributed random variables with densities 
  <dig> fm=λmΓλmmαm−1exp, 



  <dig> fu=λuΓλuuαu−1exp, 


where α
m,α
u and λ
m,λ
u are the shape and rate parameters of f
m and f
u, respectively. from  it follows that the means and variances of m, u are given by α
m/λ
m, α
u/λ
u and αm/λm <dig>  αu/λu <dig>  respectively  <cit> .

regression models for the analysis of beta values
since the ratio b=m/ is bounded between  <dig> and  <dig>  it has been argued that a linear regression model of the form 
  <dig> b=x⊤γ+ε,γ∈ℝp+ <dig> ε∼n <dig> σ <dig>  


is not appropriate to model dna methylation. in particular, the variance of b is usually smaller near the boundaries than near the middle of the interval , implying that the homoscedasticity assumption var=σ
 <dig> is violated  <cit> .

in view of this problem, several statistical models for bounded response variables have been developed . a simple approach is to calculate logit-transformed beta values  and to fit a linear regression model of the form 
  <dig> log2b1−b=x⊤γ+ε,ε∼n <dig> σ <dig>  


although this strategy has become popular in the analysis of dna methylation, it has the drawback that the methylation status  is not analyzed on its original scale but on a transformed scale  <cit> . furthermore, as shown by wahl et al.  <cit> , the empirical distribution of logit-transformed beta values usually deviates from normality.

an alternative approach that operates on the untransformed scale of b is beta regression, which is characterized by a beta distributed outcome variable with probability density function 
  <dig> φ=ΓΓΓϕ)bμϕ−1ϕ− <dig>  


where μ and ϕ denote the mean and precision parameters, respectively, of the probability density function φ. the predictor-response relationship is usually defined by a monotone increasing link function g and by the model equation g=x
⊤
γ  <cit> . a common choice for g is the logit transformation log). since the variance of a beta distributed random variable is given by μ/ , beta regression accounts for heteroscedasticity and for small variances near the boundaries of the interval . on the other hand, a major shortcoming of  in the context of dna methylation analysis is that the signal intensities m and u are implicitly assumed to be independent and to share a common rate parameter. under these assumptions, the ratio b=m/ can be shown to follow a beta distribution . the independence assumption, however, cannot be confirmed by empirical findings, which show that the signal intensities obtained from the illumina 450k array are often positively correlated .

a statistical model for the ratio of correlated gamma distributed random variables
to address the issues described in the section “regression models for the analysis of beta values”, we propose a statistical model  model”) that is based on the bivariate distribution of the signal intensities m and u. in contrast to beta regression, we assume that m and u are not independent but can be described by a bivariate gamma distribution with probability density function 
  <dig> fm,u=αΓmuρλmλuα−12exp−λmm1−ρ×exp−λuu1−ρiα−12ρλmλumu1−ρ, 


where λ
m,λ
u,α> <dig>  0<ρ< <dig>  and i
α− <dig> is the modified bessel function of the first kind of order α− <dig>  the distribution in  is due to kibble  <cit>  and is often referred to as “wicksell-kibble bivariate gamma distribution”  <cit> . as stated in various articles and monographs , the marginal densities f
m, f
u of m and u, respectively, are given by 
  <dig> fm=λmΓλmmα−1exp, 



  <dig> fu=λuΓλuuα−1exp. 


the equations in  and  imply that m and u are gamma distributed random variables with a common shape parameter α and with means and variances given by α/λ
m, α/λ
u and α/λm <dig>  α/λu <dig>  respectively. the restriction to a common shape parameter ensures that all measured signal intensities refer to probability density functions sharing the same basic form. on the other hand, the unequal rate parameters λ
m and λ
u guarantee sufficient flexibility in modeling the differences in the marginal densities of m and u  and ). it can further be shown that the pearson correlation of m and u is equal to ρ, implying that  imposes a correlation structure on the two signal intensities .

in the next step, the distribution of the ratio b=m/ is derived:

proposition 1
let the distribution of  be defined by the probability density function in . then the ratio b=m/ follows a univariate distribution with probability density function 
  <dig> fb=ΓΓ2ααbα−1×λmb+λuλmb+λu2−4ρλmλubα+ <dig> .

estimation and hypothesis tests
to obtain a consistent estimator of the coefficient vector γ, the log-likelihood function in  needs to be maximized over both γ and the hyperparameters α and ρ. to this purpose, we propose the application of a gradient boosting algorithm with linear base-learning functions, as described in  <cit> . for given data i= <dig> …,n, gradient boosting is a generic optimizer that minimizes a risk function ri= <dig> …,n) over an unknown prediction function f, with the only requirement being the existence of the derivative ∂r/∂f  <cit> .

because the base-learning functions are chosen to be linear in x, the space of the prediction function f is restricted to the subspace defined by f=x
⊤
γ, implying that estimation of f reduces to the estimation of the coefficient vector γ . furthermore, gradient boosting allows for the additional estimation of the hyperparameters α and ρ  <cit> . maximum likelihood  estimates of γ, α and ρ can therefore be obtained by setting r equal to the negative of the log-likelihood in  and by running gradient boosting until convergence.

by standard maximum likelihood arguments, the hypotheses “ h

k≠0” can be investigated by plugging the ml estimates γ^, α^ and ρ^ in the observed information matrix j=−∑i=1n∂2log)/∂2γ and by calculating the test statistic

k is asymptotically standard normally distributed as n→∞. details on the calculation of j are given in additional file  <dig> 

RESULTS
description and pre-processing of the hnr study data
to investigate the properties of the rcg model derived in the section “a statistical model for the ratio of correlated gamma distributed random variables”, we analyzed both simulated data and a real sample of illumina 450k methylation data from the heinz nixdorf recall study  <cit> . the hnr study is an ongoing cohort study in the german cities of mülheim, essen and bochum that enrolled a total of  <dig>  participants aged 45- <dig> years between  <dig> and  <dig>  data collection included health, lifestyle and environmental variables; the 10-year follow-up of the study was completed in  <dig> 

for the present analysis, we considered a random sample of n=  <dig>  study participants whose dna samples were sodium-bisulfite converted and processed using illumina infinium humanmethylation <dig> beadchips v <dig> . processing was done according to the manufacturer’s manual on a fully automated iscan system between april  <dig> and january  <dig>  technical quality control was performed using genomestudio v <dig> .

pre-processing of the methylation data was based on the r add-on package minfi  <cit> . briefly, persons that contained > <dig> % low-confidence beta values  and cpg sites with more than  <dig> % low-confidence beta values were dropped. cpg sites that contained either a snp at the cpg interrogation or at the single nucleotide extension were also excluded from statistical analysis. in addition, cpg sites referring to cross-reactive probes were removed, followed by the exclusion of x and y chromosomal sites. normalization of the beta values was carried out using the functional normalization algorithm  <cit> , which was applied separately to type i and type ii probes. the k-nearest-neighbor method with k= <dig> was used to impute missing beta values.

after pre-processing, a total of n=  <dig>  persons and  <dig>  cpg sites remained in the analysis set. the distribution of the  <dig>  pearson correlation coefficients between the signal intensities m and u is shown in fig.  <dig>  the majority of the coefficients was substantially larger than zero, indicating that the independence assumption for m and u was not justified. more than  <dig>  % of the correlation coefficients were positive .
fig.  <dig> analysis of the hnr study data. the figure shows a kernel density plot of the pearson correlations between the signal intensities m and u across the full set of  <dig>  cpg sites




in addition to the beta values, we considered the covariates “gender” , “age” , “body mass index” , “ces-d depression score”  and “smoking status” . we selected these covariates because they are generally considered to be relevant for the analysis of dna methylation .

simulation study
one of the main goals of a dna methylation study is to identify cpg sites that are “significantly” associated with one or more covariates of interest. we therefore conducted a simulation study on the power of downstream hypothesis tests, as obtained from m-value regression, beta regression and the proposed rcg model.

power analysis at a single cpg site
in the first part of the simulation study, we considered a random cpg site  and based the study on the effect sizes obtained from the hnr study data . the maximum likelihood estimates were

sensitivity analysis
in the second part of the simulation study, we carried out a sensitivity analysis and investigated the power of downstream hypothesis tests in situations where the bivariate distribution of the signal intensities m and u deviated from the wicksell-kibble distribution. to this purpose, we repeated the analysis of cpg site cg <dig> and generated correlated gamma distributed signal intensities using a copula-based approach. more specifically, we generated standard uniformly distributed values , i= <dig> …, <dig>  from a gumbel copula of the form

extension to  <dig>  cpg sites
in the third part of the simulation study, we extended the power analysis of part one and investigated the behavior of downstream hypothesis tests using  <dig>  “real-life” combinations of the parameters α, ρ and γ. to this purpose, we randomly selected  <dig>  cpg sites and fitted the respective rcg models to the hnr study data. at each site, we used the rcg estimates to generate  <dig>  beta values from the distribution of the ratio in . using the  <dig>  × <dig>  beta values, we estimated the power of the test on the hypotheses “ h

analysis of the heinz nixdorf recall study data
analysis of model fit
in the first part of the analysis, we analyzed and compared the fits obtained from the rcg, beta regression and m-value regression models. to this purpose, the data were randomly subdivided into ten pairs of training and test data sets, each of sizes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. using all five covariates, rcg, beta regression and m-value regression models were fitted to the ten learning data sets at each of the  <dig>  cpg sites. to evaluate the model fits, we calculated the predictive log-likelihood values  obtained from the respective test data sets. being a “proper” performance measure, the log-score is maximized by the log-likelihood of the true data-generating model  <cit> . in addition to the full models, we also evaluated the intercept models  that contained no covariates at all.

the average log-score differences obtained from beta regression, m-value regression and the rcg model are shown fig.  <dig>  the rcg model fitted the hnr study data systematically better than beta and m-value regression . this result was obtained for both the full model containing all five covariates  and the covariate-free null model .

rejection rates of downstream hypothesis tests

analysis of cpg sites that are known to be associated with age and/or smoking behavior
in the third part of the analysis, we validated the rcg methodology by focusing on subsets of cpg sites that were previously reported to be associated with age or smoking behavior. the idea of this analysis was to investigate whether the rcg rejection rates at these “true positive” cpg sites were comparable to the respective rejection rates obtained from beta and m-value regression. four subsets of cpg sites were considered: the first subset comprised the  <dig> smoking-associated cpg sites that were identified by zeilinger et al.  <cit>  in a replication sample of n= <dig> persons . of these cpg sites, a total of  <dig> cpg sites were used in our analysis, as they passed the quality checks applied the hnr study data. the second subset comprised the  <dig> smoking-associated cpg sites reported by harlid et al.  <cit> , of which  <dig> sites passed the quality checks applied to the hnr study data. the third subset comprised the  <dig> age-associated cpg sites that were identified by florath et al.  <cit>  in a test sample of n= <dig> persons . of these cpg sites, a total of  <dig> cpg sites passed the quality checks applied the hnr study data. the fourth subset comprised the  <dig> age-associated cpg sites identified by teschendorff et al.  <cit>  , of which  <dig> sites passed the quality checks applied to the hnr study data. the full list of these cpg sites, which include numerous pcgt cpgs as well as cpgs mapping to ahrr, is contained in additional file  <dig> 

at each of the aforementioned cpg sites we analyzed the p-values obtained from the rcg method, m-value regression and beta regression. in a subsequent step we computed the rejection rates of the three methods in each subset. to ensure the comparability of the results across the four subsets, we used a global significance level of p<10− <dig>  which was approximately equal to the bonferroni-corrected  <dig> % alpha level  <cit> . the agreement between the rejection rates of the three modeling techniques was measured by the percentage of cpg sites with identical test results for the three techniques, and also by cohen’s kappa.

the results, which are presented in full detail in additional file  <dig>  demonstrate a very high agreement between the rcg, m-value regression and beta regression models in each of the four subsets. the rejection rates obtained from the three methods were almost identical in each of the four subsets . the percentage of agreement ranged between  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %; cohen’s kappa values ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the florath et al. subset and were throughout larger than  <dig>  in the zeilinger et al., harlid et al. and teschendorff et al. subsets. these findings demonstrate that the rcg methodology resulted in a valid number of “true hits” at cpg sites with confirmed associations between methylation status and age / smoking behavior.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the development of statistical models to analyze dna methylation is the subject of intense and ongoing research . in this article, we proposed a likelihood-based approach to analyze and infer the associations between covariates and methylation levels in illumina 450k data. in contrast to beta regression, the proposed rcg model accounts for possible correlations between methylated and unmethylated signal intensities, thereby increasing the flexibility of the model in describing the distribution of methylation levels at individual cpg sites. the analysis of the heinz nixdorf recall study data suggests that the rcg model fitted the data systematically better than traditional approaches like beta and m-value regression. this result is in line with our previous findings, which suggest that “at the majority of cpg sites, methylation follows neither a beta distribution, nor a normal distribution after any of the investigated transformations”  <cit> .

in our simulation study, the rcg model resulted in higher true positive rates for the associations between dna methylation and the covariates than beta and m-value regression. as expected, the differences between the rcg model and competing methods were largest at cpg sites with high correlations between methylated and unmethylated signal intensities. at the same time, the simulation study showed that rcg-based type i error rates were close to the nominal level of significance. by using combinations of site-wise p-values, it is straightforward to extend the rcg methodology to wider regions on the dna such as cpg islands or island shores.

a crucial issue in dna methylation analysis is the selection of an appropriate procedure for normalization and quality control  <cit> . to this purpose, numerous pre-processing techniques have been developed, with the minfi pipeline used in this paper being a popular example. when deriving the rcg model, we implicitly assumed that all observed beta values were properly normalized and were observed without measurement error. while proper normalization and quality control should be taken for granted in any high-quality dna methylation study, it might be worth investigating the effect of various pre-processing techniques on the behavior of the rcg model .

the use of a gradient boosting algorithm to optimize the parameters of the rcg model lays the ground for a variety of additional modeling options. for example, it is straightforward to account for nonlinear covariate effects and to extend the linear predictor in  by a set of spline functions. furthermore, it is possible to embed the rcg model in the gamlss framework  <cit>  and to increase its flexibility by relating the parameters α and ρ to separate linear or additive predictors. for details, see  <cit>  and  <cit> .

while the proposed rcg model was tested using methylation data from illumina’s 450k array, we expect the analysis of beta values to gain even more importance with the recent launch of the infinium methylationepic beadchip array covering more than  <dig>  cpg sites  <cit> .
