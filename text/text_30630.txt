BACKGROUND
eukaryotic gene order is not random with respect to gene functions or expression patterns: clusters of co-expressed genes are routinely observed in a wide range of species  <cit> . for example, 'housekeeping' genes expressed in many tissues tend to cluster in humans  <cit> ; directly neighbouring gene pairs are more likely to act in the metabolic pathway  <cit> ; and neighbouring genes that are transcribed divergently  are unusually frequent in the human genome and show particularly strong co-expression  <cit> . co-expression is not restricted to close neighbours; in yeast, significant co-expression is observed over distances covering dozens of genes  <cit> .

several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this local co-expression of neighbouring gene pairs, including shared promoters or transcription factor binding sites, transcriptional read-through, and chromatin remodelling  <cit> . in the yeast genome, for example, much local co-expression may stem from chromatin domains that as a whole switch between euchromatin and heterochromatin states  <cit> . it is not clear to what extent this observation can be extrapolated to other model species: in mammalian genomes, there appears to be no corresponding compartmentalization of tissue-specific genes into co-regulated regions  <cit> . thus, the relative contributions of different local co-expression mechanisms seem to vary across species  <cit> . this may not be surprising: fine details of gene regulation are under strong, species-specific selective pressures, and are affected by multiple internal and external cellular factors  <cit> .

due to the compactness of its genome  <cit> , the thale cress arabidopsis thaliana is a multi-cellular eukaryote particularly well suited to the study of local co-expression. short intergenic regions mean that neighbouring genes are physically very close to each other. as all proposed mechanisms for local co-expression are likely to act in a distance-dependent way  <cit> , this should enhance their signal compared to genomes with larger and more variable gene distances. several previous studies have examined local co-expression in a. thaliana.

similar to previous results in fungi and animals , neighbouring genes in a. thaliana are on average more co-expressed than expected by chance  <cit> . 5-10% of a. thaliana genes are located in highly co-expressed clusters of 2- <dig> neighbouring genes  <cit> ; however, these are mostly not in the same gene ontology  categories, and there is no detectable micro-syntenty of co-expressed clusters to corresponding clusters in rice  <cit> . evolutionary conservation of gene neighbourhood was stronger for highly co-expressed gene pairs, as well as for gene pairs sharing at least one go category. the genes in 60% of metabolic pathways show significant clustering on a. thaliana chromosomes, a feature also found in other eukaryotes  <cit> . while co-expresion of tandemly duplicated genes provides some of the signal, neighbour co-expression remains significant even when excluding duplicated genes  <cit> .

several previous studies have examined the role of relative gene orientation in determining co-expression levels of neighbouring genes, and have found that divergent transcription can account for some but not all of the co-expression effect  <cit> . divergent transcription of a. thaliana is preferentially associated with certain go categories  <cit> , and co-expression is increased between genes of related functions  <cit> . thus, while the possible sharing of promoter regions explains part of the co-expression pattern, it is highly likely that chromatin effects also play an important role in a. thaliana. this is supported by the finding that duplicated genes which are parts of larger duplications retain strongly correlated expression patterns, as long as their neighbourhood is conserved  <cit> .

in this study, we dissect co-expression patterns of neighbouring gene pairs in the model plant species a. thaliana, paying particular attention to the relative orientation of the genes and to intergenic distances. we find the strongest co-expression among uni-directional gene pairs; this contrasts with results in humans and yeast, where bi-directional gene pairs are the most strongly co-expressed. this contradiction is resolved when examining only closely spaced gene pairs , where bi-directional pairs are the most strongly co-expressed also in a. thaliana. in line with expectations, this indicates that sharing of regulatory elements enhances co-expression. the opposite effect is seen for shared 3' regions in convergent gene pairs: these show decreased co-expression levels. the latter observation appears consistent with a model of transcription termination in which the polymerase overshoots the polyadenylation addition site  <cit> , and may hence interfere with the transcription of closely positioned downstream genes.

RESULTS
co-expression extends over large distances
using expression data across  <dig>  microarray experiments , we calculated the pearson correlation coefficients for all pairs of neighbouring protein coding genes. the co-expression values range from - <dig> to  <dig>  with values close to  <dig> indicating high co-expression, and values close to - <dig> indicating strong anti-correlation of expression. co-expression values were averaged over all pairs with the same distance  . as shown in figure  <dig>  genes in close proximity tend to be highly co-expressed. this co-expression extends at least  <dig> genes along the genome: mean co-expression of all gene pairs with the same number d of intervening genes is significantly higher than for random pairs . thus, co-expression clusters seem to extend further than previously considered  <cit> . co-expression rapidly drops as soon as there are any intervening genes . this is consistent with previous reports on arabidopsis, which found that strongly co-expressed clusters are small   <cit> .

why does co-expression drop so fast? consider three consecutive genes a-b-c. if both a-b and b-c are correlated in their expression, shouldn't it follow that a-c are correlated similarly? assume that the corresponding expression patterns  are correlated such that variation in a explains a fraction rab <dig> of variation in b, and variation in b explains a fraction rbc <dig> of variation in c. if there is no direct interaction of a and c, we would expect a correlation rac <dig> = rab <dig> Ã— rbc <dig> between a and c. if we insert the numbers read from figure  <dig>  we thus expect a co-expression value of approx.  <dig>  for pairs with  <dig> intervening gene, which is actually substantially lower than the observed value. this indicates that there are indeed local factors that enhance co-expression for pairs that are not direct neighbours.

different orientations show different co-expression levels
by far the strongest co-expression is seen for direct neighbours, on which we focused next. to ensure a priori independence of the genes, we removed all genes that overlap with other  genes in the genome according to the tair <dig> annotation  <cit> . the remaining  <dig>  pairs of non-overlapping protein coding gene pairs were further classified according to their relative orientations, resulting in  <dig>  bi-directional ,  <dig>  uni-directional , and  <dig>  convergent pairs .

for all three types, average co-expression of neighbouring gene pairs was significantly stronger compared to random pairs , consistent with previous results  <cit> . while average co-expression is positive, we found that  <dig> % of neighbouring pairs show anti-correlated expression ; similar distributions were observed in humans  <cit> .

among the three relative orientations, uni-directional pairs showed the highest average expression correlation, as was also observed previously  <cit> . this contrasts with findings in the human genome, where bi-directional pairs are more highly co-expressed  <cit> . due to the vast evolutionary distance and different ecology, direct comparisons are of course difficult; however, one possible reason for this difference between humans and plants is the existence of bicistronic and fused monocistronic transcripts in the a. thaliana genome  <cit> . bicistronic transcripts contain two separate open reading frames , leading to perfect co-expression of the orfs; fused monocistronic transcripts arise by the fusion of two adjacent transcripts in particular tissues or environments, leading to elevated co-expression. to test if the higher average co-expression of uni-directional pairs might be attributed to bicistronic and fused monocistronic transcripts, we used a previously determined set of such genes . we found an average co-expression of  <dig> , only slightly higher than the value obtained for all uni-directional transcripts. after excluding these bicistronic and fused monocistronic transcripts, uni-directional gene pairs are still more co-expressed than the two alternative relative orientations .

long intergene distances do not reduce co-expression
what is the role of shared chromatin domains in promoting the co-expression of neighbouring gene pairs? we can shed some light on this question by examining the distance dependence of co-expression. as we are concerned with transcription initiation and elongation, we defined gene distances as the number of base pairs between the respective transcript boundaries . we did not find any significant correlation between distance and co-expression for neighbouring gene pairs more than  <dig> bp and less than  <dig> kb apart  . thus, if chromatin domains do play a role in promoting co-expression, their length must be large or flexible enough to encompass even distant gene neighbours. that co-expression decreases rapidly as soon as two genes are separated by intervening genes  indicates that either chromatin domains usually contain at most two genes, or that more direct interactions between the transcription processes of the neighbours are responsible for co-expression.

the average expression correlation of convergent gene pairs with short intergenic distances was statistically indistinguishable from random gene pairs . however, at longer distances , convergent gene pairs did show significant co-expression . for these more distant neighbours, there was actually no difference in the co-expression of convergent and bi-directional pairs . uni-directional pairs showed stronger co-expression than the other two types at these larger distances . this strong co-expression may be more accidental  than functional, as uni-directional pairs are those least conserved in plant evolution  <cit> .

direct interactions of the polymerases transcribing two neighbouring genes will be very different for convergent and divergent pairs. however, at distances > <dig> bp we find no difference between the co-expression of convergently and divergently transcribed gene pairs. this observation is strong evidence that not direct interactions, but shared chromatin regions are in fact responsible for co-expression at these larger distances. thus, we conclude that co-expression of distant genes  is mostly due to chromatin effects. the cutoff  <dig> bp was chosen here based on figure 2; a lower threshold of  <dig> bp leads to qualitatively very similar results.

short bi-directional gene pairs are strongly co-expressed
as seen from figure  <dig>  the three orientations exhibit very different co-expression patterns at short distances . bi-directional gene pairs closer than  <dig> bp are more co-expressed than either more distant bi-directional pairs  or close neighbours in other orientations . this is consistent with the existence of shared cis-regulatory motifs or promoters in some overlapping promoter regions. at least in yeast  <cit>  and mammals  <cit> , approximately half of all promoters initiate transcription in both directions, and it is conceivable that the same applies in arabidopsis.

transcriptional interference between short uni-directional and convergent gene pairs
as seen in figure  <dig>  short convergent as well as short uni-directional gene pairs show reduced co-expression levels compared to more distant pairs of the same orientation . this reduced co-expression suggests some kind of transcriptional interference between the neighbouring genes.

what could be responsible? that this reduced co-expression is found only when at least one of the two genes flankes the intergenic region with its 3' end suggests an involvement of transcription termination. indeed, transcription by rna-polymerase ii  <cit>   usually extends beyond the poly site. in the 'torpedo' model of transcription termination  <cit> , the mrna is released by cleavage while rna is still being synthesised. the remaining rna trails out of the active polymerase, and is chewed up by an exonuclease. once the 'exonuclease-torpedo' catches up, it dislodges the polymerase, thereby terminating transcription. thus, the polymerase of an upstream gene may transcribe into the downstream neighbour, interfering with the neighbour's transcription .

we further tested the transcriptional interference model by examining overlapping gene pairs on opposing strands. we grouped these into three distinct types according to the tair  <dig> annotation of the a. thaliana genome . consistent with the presence of transcriptional interference, mean co-expression of gene pairs with overlaps in their 3' regions  was negative. for group  <dig>  co-expression was significantly lower than that of random gene pairs; for group  <dig> the difference did not reach statistical significance, possibly due to low sample size . however, genes overlapping exclusively in their 5' regions  showed positive co-expression . mean co-expression in group  <dig> was almost as high as for close non-overlapping bi-directional pairs . thus, transcriptional interference seems indeed restricted to the 3' ends of genes, suggesting a role of transcription termination; conversely, the restriction to 3' ends seems not consistent with the simple collision of two polymerases as the source of reduced co-expression.

overlapping gene pairs on different strands  actually form sense-antisense  pairs. thus, the lower co-expression of these genes could potentially be explained by rna interference, which would reduce both the expression abundance and the co-expression of sa pairs. as shown in table  <dig>  partially overlapping genes are in fact more abundant  or equally abundant  as randomly picked genes. this indicates that at least for partially overlapping genes, expression is not strongly influenced by rna interference .

CONCLUSIONS
direct neighbours are more often co-expressed than are more distant genes. beyond approximately  <dig> bp, the level of co-expression is independent of the intergenic distance, and is the same for divergent and convergent pairs. these results suggest that beyond  <dig> bp, co-expression is due to shared chromatin domains rather than to direct transcriptional interactions. this chromatin-mediated effect leads to an increase in the expression correlation coefficient of about  <dig>  across our set of  <dig>  microarray experiments .

using the strength of this effect as a reference, we can get an approximate estimate of the contributions of chromatin-mediated effects and direct interactions. we estimate that for close bi-directional pairs, shared promoter regions are on average responsible for roughly 70% of the co-expression signal / <dig> ), while the shared chromatin environment accounts for the remaining 30%. further, for close convergent gene pairs, the co-expression mediated by a shared chromatin environment is reduced by roughly 40% through transcriptional interference / <dig> ).

as long as there are no intervening genes, chromatin-mediated co-expression does not seem to diminish with increasing intergenic distance. this observation suggests that chromatin domain establishment is regulated such that domains extend as far as needed, regardless of intergenic distance. this conclusion appears consistent with recent results on the role of nucleosome organization and 3-d chromatin structure in gene regulation  <cit> .

at short distances, direct transcriptional interactions become important. for divergent gene pairs, the most important direct interactions are probably the sharing of transcriptional regulatory sites, and bi-directional initiation of rna-polymerase ii transcription from a shared promoter; such bi-directional promoters appear to be the rule rather than an exception in yeast and mammals  <cit> . that we found elevated co-expression of bi-directional gene pairs only below ~ <dig> bp strongly supports this notion, as this range is similar to the distance found between the two divergent peaks of transcription in other eukaryotes  <cit> . beyond promoting co-expression, bi-directional transcription from a single promoter may also serve as a positive feedback loop to support continued expression.

a rather different direct transcriptional interaction is likely responsible for the reduced co-expression found for those pairs where the intergenic region is flanked by at least one 3' gene end . in transcription termination, the polymerase overshoots the poly-site before being dislodged by a following exonuclease  <cit> ; this may result in continued transcription through the intergenic region and into the neighbouring gene, interfering with the neighbour's transcription.

in contrast to previous results in humans and yeast  <cit> , we found that uni-directional gene pairs were on average more co-expressed than bi-directional pairs. this is presumably due to the more compact spacing of a. thaliana genes, with a higher fraction of closely-spaced uni-directional gene pairs. when comparing the co-expression of the different orientations at fixed intergenic distances, our results agree with those in other eukaryotes.
