BACKGROUND
the size of the inoculum that initiates infection in hiv- <dig> is unknown, although the loss of diversity is thought to be substantial following both horizontal  <cit>  and vertical  <cit>  transmission. if the bottleneck is selectively neutral, genetic drift will occur because only a small number of variants are chosen at random from the population to propagate the new infection. the smaller the amount of genetic diversity transmitted the greater the magnitude of drift, lowering the probability that adaptive changes that emerge within hosts will survive transmission.

in rna viruses with a high deleterious mutation rate the majority of variants exhibit a replicative capacity lower than the mean  <cit> . because the fittest variants may only be present at a low frequency, they are susceptible to random loss. hence when genetic drift is strong, deleterious mutations may accumulate, leading to an irreversible decline in population fitness  <cit> . although the high rate of recombination in hiv- <dig> in vivo  <cit>  has the potential to rescue debilitated haplotypes  <cit> , if a new infection is initiated by only one or a few viral particles, and if these are chosen at random from the parent population, then the transmission of hiv- <dig> will likely incur a substantial reduction in fitness  <cit> . as the inoculum size increases, potential fitness losses are rapidly reduced  <cit> .

conversely, natural selection may lower the susceptibility of hiv- <dig> to reductions of fitness associated with transmission. in acutely infected hiv- <dig> patients, the usually diverse envelope v <dig> region is more homogeneous than gag p <dig>  whereas in chronic infection the opposite is true  <cit> . positive selection operating on envelope during transmission has been invoked as an explanation  <cit> . if selection operates to influence which variants are transmitted then it will also prevent the fixation of deleterious mutations.

herein we estimate, using population genetic techniques, the proportion of genetic diversity that survives transmission in a single homosexual transmitter pair, with samples available before and after the transmission event. the demographic history of the virus population in both donor and recipient was reconstructed using coalescent methodology, allowing quantification of the diversity present close to the time of infection. the coalescent was implemented within a bayesian framework, which enabled co-estimation of substitution and demographic parameters using serially sampled sequences  <cit> .

through a comparison of different regions of the genome  we also investigate whether selection is likely to be acting during hiv- <dig> transmission. finally, we generalise our result by estimating the diversity present close to the time of infection in nine homosexual seroconverters for which donor sequences were unavailable, and compare horizontal and vertical modes of transmission using  <dig> infants infected at birth.

RESULTS
to directly visualise the change in genetic diversity during horizontal hiv- <dig> transmission between the donor-recipient pair studied, we first inferred the phylogenetic relationships among their hiv- <dig> sequences using maximum likelihood methods. the phylogenies for env v1-v <dig> and gag p <dig> depicted in figure  <dig> show that branch lengths are substantially shortened immediately after transmission, illustrating that a significant reduction in diversity has occurred.

to investigate the demographics of viral transmission in this transmitter pair more closely, four coalescent models were fitted to the sequence data. crucially, samples were available both before and after the transmission event allowing distinct demographic functions for donor and recipient hiv- <dig> populations , with the time of transition between them estimated from the data  <cit> . in addition to a null model that constrained the effective population size in donor  and recipient  to be identical , models with constant, exponential and logistic demographic functions for the recipient population were fitted. in all cases the donor population size was assumed to be constant.

the relative bayesian posterior scores for each demographic model are listed in table  <dig>  for both env v1-v <dig> and gag p <dig>  the model with the lowest aic  fits a constant population size in the donor and logistic growth in the recipient . the null hypothesis that there has been no change in population size at transmission was therefore rejected. using the estimated model parameters we reconstructed the demographic profiles of genetic diversity  against time for each gene .

to further test the extent of the transmission bottleneck, the demographic history of the population was reconstructed using the bayesian skyline plot . the results for env v1-v <dig> and gag p <dig> are shown in figure  <dig>  in both cases there is a good fit between the demographic profiles estimated using the two different methods. noticeably, the timing of the transmission bottleneck is the same, and evidence for a bottleneck is readily apparent under both models.

the bayesian skyline plot also justifies our use of the logistic-constant demographic model to estimate the diversity that survives during horizontal transmission of hiv- <dig>  using the logistic growth model  we were able to calculate diversity in the recipient nrτ at the estimated time of transmission ttrans. we estimated ttrans to be approximately  <dig> days prior to collection of the first recipient sample  for env and  <dig> days for gag . we calculated nrτ to be  <dig>  for env v1-v <dig>  and  <dig>  for gag p <dig> . these values are near the lower prior boundary of one and their posterior distributions both exhibit a large positive skew . the level of diversity in the donor at the time of transmission ndτ was compared with that which was transmitted nrτ as a percentage ratio δ. for env, ndτ was estimated to be  <dig>  giving a value of δ as  <dig> %. for gag p <dig>  ndτ was  <dig>  giving δ as  <dig> % .

importantly, if selection was acting on env to restrict the proportion of variants capable of establishing a new infection, we would expect a greater loss of diversity in this region when compared to gag, assuming recombination between the two regions. therefore, the similarity in δ between env and gag argues against strong selection at transmission.

we conclude that > 99% of genetic diversity in the donor viral population, in both env and gag, was lost during this case of horizontal transmission. a reduction in viral diversity after horizontal transmission has been reported frequently in the literature  <cit> . however, information regarding the diversity present in the donor is often lacking, and even in cases where this data exists  <cit>  it is difficult to measure levels of diversity close to the transmission event. the method implemented here overcomes this problem, estimating genetic diversity at the inferred time of transmission, and therefore allows accurate quantification of the transmission bottleneck.

to generalise this result we next investigated diversity  of the founding viral population in nine patients infected through homosexual contact for which donor sequences were unavailable. sequences had been published previously  <cit> . assuming the best-fit demographic model, nτ at seroconversion was found to vary between around  <dig> and  <dig> . in the recipient of the transmitter pair, nτ at seroconversion  was  <dig> , which is not significantly different .

finally, to compare the diversity present close to the time of infection in patients infected via two different modes of transmission, we estimated nτ at birth  in  <dig> vertically infected infants. the average nτ at birth was  <dig> . although we were unable to detect a bottleneck at transmission in eight of the infants , the estimates for nτ close to the time of infection in the horizontally and vertically infected patient groups were not significantly different .

discussion
from our analysis of a single donor and recipient transmission pair, we conclude that in this case the viral diversity sampled during homosexual transmission of hiv- <dig> was very small . this result was consistent for both env and gag. interpretation of our finding is dependent on whether transmission is considered a neutral or selective process. in particular, if transmission is neutral it can be concluded from the severe bottleneck reported here that the consequent genetic drift will be strong, with negative consequences for viral fitness. natural selection on the other hand is likely to mitigate any deleterious effects of genetic drift associated with transmission.

it is possible that the diversity present in the inoculum itself was larger, and that selection acting on env restricted propagation of the new infection to a few members of the initial population  <cit> . the similar levels of diversity observed in env and gag could then be explained by genetic coupling between the two regions. the frequency with which recombination occurs in hiv- <dig>  <cit>  argues against such linkage, suggesting that independent selective forces acting on env and gag must be invoked to explain this observation. alternatively, if transmission is neutral then our estimate of the diversity transmitted will be closer to the diversity actually present in the inoculum. this will have implications for the replicative fitness of the viral population responsible for founding a new infection. indeed, it has been shown experimentally that a random population bottleneck of a single clone can have severe consequences for the replicative fitness of hiv- <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, by lowering their chances of transmission, genetic drift has the potential to prevent the accumulation of advantageous changes at the population level, thereby impeding the long-term adaptation of hiv- <dig>  <cit> .

neutral transmission also means that the degree of genetic diversity passed between individuals is dependent on the diversity present in the donor at the time of transmission. because diversity in their respective donors is likely to vary greatly depending on the stage of infection  <cit> , this could in part explain our finding of wide variation across patients in diversity of the viral population close to transmission . furthermore, we found the degree of variability across patients infected by the same route to be greater than any difference between groups infected via different modes of transmission . interestingly, the diversity present early in acute infection in sexually and parenterally infected individuals also appears similar  <cit> .

we can conclude from our results that diversity of the founding population is similarly restricted during both horizontal and vertical transmission. however, it is also clear that further study is required to investigate the variability observed. for example, although a reduction in diversity is frequent  <cit> , the transmission of multiple variants has also been reported during both horizontal  <cit>  and vertical transmission  <cit> , suggesting that the bottleneck is not universally restrictive.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings quantify the contraction in genetic diversity that occurs during horizontal transmission of hiv- <dig>  it is clear from the severity of the bottleneck that further work is required to investigate the nature of the selective forces surrounding transmission, if we are to interpret the fitness consequences for hiv- <dig> in the newly infected individual. furthermore, the analyses presented suggest that the mode of transmission may not be a significant influence on the genetic diversity transmitted.
