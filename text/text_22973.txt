BACKGROUND
the general population is constantly exposed to low levels of radiation through natural background radiation or occupational and medical activity. for example, diagnostic x-ray procedures are the main man-made source of radiation exposure, accounting for 14% of total exposure worldwide  <cit> . there is considerable public and scientific interest in characterizing the biological effects of ionizing radiation  in the dose range occurring in the more routine x-ray procedures, with a specific focus on elucidating the underlying molecular and biochemical mechanisms.

organs are not equally sensitive to ionizing radiation, and skin, which is the most exposed organ, is among the most sensitive. skin is composed of three primary layers: epidermis, dermis and hypodermis. the interfollicular epidermis is a multilayered epithelium that covers the human skin. its primary function is to serve as a barrier against the organism's environment. keratinocytes, the main cells composing this epithelium, play a key role in the barrier function of the skin. the effects of moderate and high doses of ionizing radiation on human keratinocytes have been extensively investigated, using large scale genomic approaches  <cit> ; the effects of low-dose radiation on normal keratinocytes, on the other hand, remain largely unknown. we previously  <cit>  detected a significant transcriptional response in human keratinocytes exposed to a low dose of  <dig> cgy, but the molecular mechanisms regulating this response remain to be clarified. transcription regulation is a key level of control of the cellular response to genotoxic stress. to date, little is known about the transcription factors involved in this response, especially to very low doses of ionizing radiation. to further study this question, we used a bioinformatic strategy to identify candidate transcription factors involved in the regulation of low ir dose responding genes  <cit> . validating these putative regulators required a dedicated functional genomics approach, which was the goal of the present study.

the study shows for the first time that the transcription factor gata <dig> binds to the promoter regions of genes responding to low ir doses, and that silencing this protein in irradiated human keratinocytes leads to generalised transcriptional deregulation after  <dig> cgy x-irradiation. taken together, these data indicate that gata <dig> plays a key role in the transcriptional response of epidermal cells to very low doses of radiation.

RESULTS
gata proteins bind to the promoters of  <dig> genes responding to low-dose radiation
we have previously shown that low-dose ir induces a specific gene response in normal human differentiated keratinocytes  <cit> . a significant number of low-dose specific genes were identified, most modulated at  <dig> h. we focused on a cluster of  <dig> genes sharing a common temporal profile specific to the low dose. bioinformatic analysis of these genes' promoter sequences revealed enrichment in gata consensus sequences corresponding to gata <dig> and gata <dig> binding sites  <cit> . to validate the potential involvement of these transcription factors in the co-regulation of the  <dig> genes, we immunoprecipitated the chromatin of  <dig> cgy and mock irradiated keratinocytes with anti-gata <dig> and anti-gata <dig> antibodies. promoter sequence enrichment was analysed in  <dig> of the  <dig> genes. pcr amplification revealed gata <dig> chip enrichment in  <dig> genes of the cluster after  <dig> cgy irradiation  . some of them  were also found to be enriched in gata <dig> chip . for mgc <dig>  an opposite change was observed, with loss of gata <dig> binding after irradiation. taken together, these results indicate that irradiation induces changes in gata <dig> binding on the promoter sequences of these  <dig> cgy responding genes. gata <dig> has been shown to be expressed in differentiated keratinocytes and to play a key role in skin morphogenesis  <cit> , whereas gata1's function appears to be restricted to the hematopoietic system  <cit> . based on these data, we decided to further investigate the role of gata <dig> in controlling response to low-dose radiation in human keratinocytes.

stable gata <dig> knock-down in human keratinocytes
we studied whether lentiviral vector-expressed shrna could silence gata <dig> expression in differentiated human keratinocytes. three individual shrnas targeting different portions of gata <dig> mrna were tested in cultured keratinocytes. the knock-down efficiency of each individual shrna was measured by rt-pcr at various times after infection . all three shrnas caused significant repression of gata <dig> mrna, but sh <dig> was the most efficient, with a 20-fold decrease  <dig> hours after infection. at protein level, in cells expressing sh <dig>  a marked decrease in gata <dig> protein levels was observed at  <dig> h and  <dig> h . this shrna clone was therefore selected for a large-scale production of lentiviral particles that were used to establish stable gata <dig> knock-down after puromycin selection of infected keratinocytes. a lentiviral vector expressing an shrna without any target in the human genome  served as control.

radiosensitivity of keratinocytes expressing shgata3
the radiation sensitivity of keratinocytes expressing shgata <dig> and shscr was assessed by proliferation-based assay . cell viability was monitored  <dig> h after irradiation, since it is known that cell death may take at least two days to occur in irradiated keratinocytes  <cit> . shgata <dig> cells were found to be more sensitive than shscr cells at  <dig> cgy, whereas no significant difference was observed after a dose of  <dig> gy . this result highlights a specific role of gata <dig> transcription factor in the early response to the lower dose. to evaluate long-term radiosensitivity, colony formation assay was used. cells were seeded at low density, then irradiated the next day at either  <dig> gy or  <dig> cgy and cultured for  <dig> weeks. the number of colonies was then determined by manual counting . more colonies were found for shgata <dig> cells, whatever the radiation dose. this could reflect the overall positive effect of gata <dig> knock-down on cell proliferation, previously described in epithelial cells  <cit> . this effect is similar in both  <dig> gy and  <dig> cgy irradiated cells, indicating that long-term radiosensitivity is unchanged in shgata <dig> cells after  <dig> cgy irradiation.

transcriptome analysis of shgata <dig> and shscr cells
to compare the response of shgata <dig> and shscr cells to low-dose radiation, we set up a large-scale transcriptome analysis using oligonucleotide microarrays. the experimental strategy is depicted in figure  <dig>  in brief, primary human keratinocytes were cultured in a semi-defined medium and then infected with either sh <dig>  or shscr lentiviral particles . cells were then cultured for  <dig> days up to confluence and then further incubated for  <dig> additional days before being subjected to a  <dig> cgy dose of x-rays. total rna was extracted  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> hours after irradiation. after rna amplification and labelling, gene profiling was performed using oligonucleotide microarrays  to compare  <dig> cgy irradiated to sham-irradiated cells at individual times. two similar analyses were performed: one in cells where gata <dig> was knocked down after expression of the sh <dig> sequence  and one in control cells expressing the shscr sequence . the silencing of gata <dig> in the shgata <dig> background was checked by qrt-pcr .

for data analysis, lowess normalization was applied; genes were selected on a p-value of p <  <dig>  and the induction/repression cut-off values were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

firstly, the number of genes induced or repressed by the  <dig> cgy radiation was compared between the shgata <dig> and shscr backgrounds. in the shscr background, the number of genes significantly induced or repressed after  <dig> cgy x-irradiation was relatively small  at all time points, and most transcripts appeared to be modulated less than 2-fold . in the shgata <dig> background, a burst of radiation-responding genes was observed, with  <dig> genes  transcriptionally regulated  <dig> h after irradiation. moreover, the magnitude of the change was completely modified, with abundance more than doubled for  <dig> of the  <dig> genes. at the other shgata <dig> analysis time points, the number of regulated genes was comparable to that in the shscr analysis. .

to validate the microarray results, two induced genes  and two repressed genes  at  <dig> h in shgata <dig> cells were selected and further studied by real-time quantitative pcr. the transcriptional response was confirmed in all  <dig> genes . as described previously  <cit> , the induction ratios on real-time pcr were often stronger than those obtained by the microarray experiments.

functional annotation and promoter analysis of ir-responding genes
genes were classified into functional groups on the basis of biological process categories from the gene ontology consortium  <cit> . total gene lists responding to  <dig> cgy ir were compared to all analysable genes in the array, using the categorical over-representation function of david. owing to the small number of ir-responding genes in most of the conditions, only genes up-regulated at  <dig> h in shgata <dig> cells gave highly significant enriched functional categories . the key up-regulated biological processes in shgata <dig> cells were found to be chaperone activity, tgfbeta signalling, stress response, rna metabolic process and phosphatase activity. at the other time points, several functional groups, including protein-protein interaction and stress response, were also enriched, with scores less than  <dig>  .

the overrepresented gene ontology categories determined by ease are indicated. * due to the high number of annotated genes in the  <dig> h shgata <dig> repressed line, the  <dig> genes are not listed.

we then focused on the genes transcriptionally deregulated  <dig> h after irradiation in shgata <dig> cells. to determine whether these genes might be direct targets of gata <dig>  a bioinformatic analysis of their promoter sequences was performed. the goal was to assess their putative enrichment in gata <dig> binding sequences. the promoter sequences  of the  <dig> most induced and most repressed genes in shgata <dig> cells at  <dig> h were studied using the matinspector promoter analysis tool  <cit> . as a control, a random sample of  <dig> genes was also analysed. genes repressed at  <dig> h in shgata <dig> cells exhibited two-fold enrichment in gata <dig> consensus sequences compared to induced genes and the random control sample . these results indicate that the list of genes repressed in shgata <dig> cells might be enriched in direct gata <dig> targets, whereas induced genes are probably indirectly regulated by gata <dig>  the fact that two of the targets validated by chip , grca and ppil <dig>  are among these repressed genes reinforces this hypothesis.

mean number of putative gata <dig> binding sites in the promoter sequences  of the  <dig> most induced and  <dig> most repressed genes in shgata <dig> cells. the mean number of putative gata <dig> binding sites is indicated. as a control, a random sample of  <dig> non-responding genes was also analyzed.

discussion
gata <dig> is a zinc finger transcription factor essential for the proper development of various tissues and organs, especially in the hematopoietic system. gata <dig> has been recently shown to be involved in the development of hair follicles and in the determination of skin cell lineage in mice  <cit> . in human skin, gata <dig> is expressed in suprabasal layers of the epidermis  <cit>  and is also regulated during the differentiation of cultured keratinocytes: gata <dig> accumulates during keratinocyte differentiation induced by addition of calcium  <cit> . gata <dig> is therefore strongly expressed in differentiated cultured keratinocytes, which were the cell models used in our previous transcription study  <cit> . gata <dig> plays a key role in the transition between proliferation and differentiation in human epidermal cells through the p63/ikkα/smad pathway  <cit> , but its function in the control of the cellular response to genotoxic stress has never been explored.

to monitor the function of gata <dig> in the low-dose ir response, we set up a cell model of primary keratinocytes with stable knock-down of gata <dig>  we decided to study cultured keratinocytes in a differentiated state mimicking the suprabasal layer of human epidermis, since these cells are the first to be exposed in therapeutic or accidental irradiation. gata <dig> was knocked down by a lentiviral-mediated shrna expression. as previously reported by others  <cit> , lentiviral vectors appear to be the most suitable for long-term transgene expression, especially in quiescent cells such as stem cells or confluent keratinocytes, whereas chemical methods or electroporation are completely inefficient. we were able to infect more than 70% of our cultured cells and obtained a marked decrease in gata <dig> protein level, which became almost undetectable on western-blot, in infected cells. what are the biological consequences of this knock-down? in a normal context, keratinocytes infected by the shgata <dig> vector exhibit a higher rate of proliferation . this effect was clearly visible in our colony-forming assay, where shgata <dig> cells were found to be more clonogenic than shscr cells, whatever the radiation dose. it can therefore be postulated that this long-term effect on proliferation conceals shgata <dig> cell hyper-sensitivity to certain doses of radiation. indeed, the xtt assay, performed  <dig> h after exposure, revealed specific shgata <dig> cell radiosensitivity to the  <dig> cgy dose, with a 16% decrease in cell viability compared to shscr cells. after the  <dig> gy dose, both cell lines exhibited the same viability. these results indicate that silencing gata <dig> modifies the cellular response of irradiated cells, specifically to the low  <dig> cgy dose, during the first hours following irradiation. specific radiosensitivity to low ir doses has been previously described for human keratinocytes  <cit> . low-dose hyper-radiosensitivity  is an effect in which cells die from excessive sensitivity to low doses  while becoming resistant to higher doses. the suggested mechanism for hrs is related to the absence at low doses of the inducible dna repair mechanism observed at higher doses  <cit> . our data indicate that gata <dig> knock-down caused increased cell death after  <dig> cgy ir compared to shscr cells, highlighting the important role of this protein in the  <dig> cgy response during the first  <dig> hours following irradiation. to more closely delineate the relative role of low-dose hrs in this increased cell death, additional studies using a larger range of dose between  <dig> cgy and  <dig>  gy will be useful.

to further test the role of gata <dig>  we compared the transcriptional response of shgata <dig> and shscr cells after  <dig> cgy ir exposure: a modified gene response profile was observed, with a burst of ir-responding genes in shgata <dig> cells at  <dig> h. this time-point of  <dig> h seems to be a key moment in the transcriptional response. our previous microarray studies found that the response to  <dig> cgy, contrary to the classical bimodal response after higher doses, was characterized by almost complete absence of transcriptional changes at early time points, followed by a large modulation at  <dig> h post-irradiation  <cit> . it can be postulated than gata <dig> is involved in the control of this  <dig> h gene response.

many of the  <dig> genes responding at  <dig> h in shgata <dig> cells were involved in fundamental mechanisms known to participate in the cellular response to genotoxic stress. such is the case of egr <dig>  the gene showing the strongest induction ratio . egr <dig> is a transcription factor strongly activated by a broad spectrum of radiation, and promoting apoptosis and growth arrest through its targets, especially some members of the p <dig> families and via activation of the egfr/erk1/ <dig> pathway  <cit> . the dusp <dig> gene, encoding a dual-specific threonine and tyrosine phosphatase, is also strongly induced in shgata <dig> cells. dusp <dig> is controlled by p <dig> during the cellular response to genotoxic stress and is a potent inhibitor of mapk activity through dephosphorylation of mapk  <cit> . the functional annotation of ir-responding genes in shgata <dig> cells  revealed several biological processes known to participate in the cellular response to stress: this is the case with tgfβ signalling, which concerns  <dig> of the  <dig> genes induced at  <dig> h in shgata <dig> cells . tgfβ <dig> is involved in the initiation of keratinocyte differentiation, by blocking their proliferation. this cytokine is also involved in wound healing, by inducing cell migration and keratinocyte matrix secretion  <cit> . moreover, tgfβ <dig> is induced in skin within hours following acute irradiation  <cit>  and plays a complex role in regulating the canonical cellular dna damage response through atm activation  <cit> . a possible link between tgfβ <dig> expression and regulation by gata proteins has been proposed in hematopoietic cell systems, but the involvement of gata <dig> in the regulation of the tgfβ pathways has never been described in keratinocytes. our functional annotation of ir-regulated genes in shgata <dig> cells also revealed enrichment in genes involved in chaperone activity and protein folding. molecular chaperones prevent protein aggregation and keep proteins in a state suitable for either refolding or degradation after a proteolytic stress such as ionizing radiation  <cit> . the present study showed that gata <dig> knock-down led to excessive sensitivity to low ir doses. it is possible that, in these cells, the fraction of proteins in an unfolded state is increased after irradiation, inducing the chaperone response.

the central question raised by our study is the link between gata <dig> and the genes that are deregulated in shgata <dig> cells. to answer this question, we looked for gata consensus sites in the promoter region of genes that are induced or repressed after irradiation in shgata <dig> cells, as compared with a random sample of non-responding genes. we did not observe any enrichment in the fraction of genes that are up-regulated: these genes are probably not direct targets of gata <dig>  their up-regulation appears to be secondary to knock-down, or a specific response of cells sensitized to low-dose radiation. on the other hand, the frequency of gata <dig> binding sites increased in the fraction of down-regulated genes . some of these genes, such as ppil <dig> and grca, which we have shown to be bound in vivo by gata <dig> , might be direct targets of gata <dig>  nevertheless, further exploration of the gata <dig> targets in the low-dose ir response will be necessary to clarify this point. the recent development of methods allowing genome-wide identification of transcription factor targets, such as chip chip  <cit>  or chip seq  <cit> , will offer the possibility of achieving this goal.

CONCLUSIONS
over the last few years, numerous large-scale transcription studies have been set up in various cell types to identify radiation-responsive genes that could serve as biomarkers  <cit> . even though hundreds of differentially expressed transcripts have thus been listed, the molecular mechanisms controlling the transcriptional regulation of these genes remain unknown. we demonstrate here for the first time the involvement of a transcription factor in the response of human cells to very low doses of x-radiation, and we show that various pathways and cellular functions are directly or indirectly dependent on this regulator. these findings open the door to better understanding of the biological effects of extremely low-dose ionizing radiation on human cells.
