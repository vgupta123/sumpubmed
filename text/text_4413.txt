BACKGROUND
over the last decades, advances in understanding basic phenomena in cryobiology has led the development of effective methods for the preservation of a very wide range of cells  <cit> . however, the cryopreservation of cells with large volumes and multicellular systems and tissues, such as vertebrate oocytes and embryos, still remains a challenge in some cases  <cit> . vertebrate oocytes show low surface area to volume ratio and low permeability to water and cryoprotectants, and as a consequence they are highly susceptible to formation of intracellular ice, cryoprotectant-toxicity, and osmotic stress. in addition, oocyte cryosurvival may change during development or as a result of different genotypes  <cit> .

one of the major obstacles with freezing of a cell is that intracellular water content crystallizes, leading to mechanical and physical damage  <cit> . to limit the rate of ice crystals formation, the first step is to permeate cells with cryoprotectant agents, such as glycerol, propylene glycol, dimethyl sulfoxide or ethylene glycol, which should reach high intracellular concentrations, thus generating the driving force for the efflux of water by osmosis and of solutes by diffusion  <cit> . this can be achieved either by a slow cooling rates with low concentration of cryoprotectants, or fast cooling after incubation in highly concentrated cryoprotectant solutions   <cit> . an ideal cryoprotectant should thus exhibit low toxicity and rapidly permeate the cell, so that osmotic volume changes, that are a recognized form of cellular stress, are minimized  <cit> . ethylene glycol shows the best efficiency/toxicity ratio on mammalian oocytes and embryos and is thus the most common selected cryoprotectant for slow-cooling or vitrification protocols  <cit> . however, the permeability of vertebrate oocytes and embryos to ethylene glycol is limited  <cit>  and may change during development and differentiation  <cit> , resulting possibly in intracellular damage after cryopreservation  <cit> .

it is now well established that biological membranes allow water to pass by simple diffusion through the lipid bilayer, or when rapid water permeability is required , through specialized membrane channels known as aquaporins. aquaporins  are integral membrane proteins present in all living organisms from bacteria to mammals  <cit> . these proteins consist of six transmembrane helices connected by five loops, two of which bear the highly conserved asparagine-proline-alanine  motifs involved in the formation of the water pore  <cit> . to date,  <dig> aquaporins have been identified in mammals  and while most of them are water-selective, functional studies have identified a subgroup of channels  that can transport also glycerol and urea, and are termed aquaglyceroporins   <cit> . some glps are also permeated by metalloids and a wide variety of noncharged solutes , including cryoprotectants such as propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, acetamide and possibly dimethyl sulfoxide  <cit> .

the discovery of aquaporins made it possible to use them for enhancing water and cryoprotectant permeability of cells  <cit> . in the baker's yeast , freeze tolerance during rapid freezing conditions positively correlates with high levels of expression of the water-selective aquaporins aqy <dig> and aqy <dig>  <cit> . this positive effect has been explained by the rapid water efflux, especially at freezing temperatures, as a consequence of high levels of aquaporins in the plasma membrane of yeast cells, resulting in the reduction of intracellular ice crystal formation and cell damage. similarly, heterologous expression of wild-type  mammalian aquaporin- <dig>  in vertebrate oocytes and embryos enhances both the efflux of water and influx of cryoprotectants into the cells  <cit> . in the case of mouse oocytes, this method ameliorates oocyte tolerance to freezing and survival after thawing  <cit> .

the increased permeability mediated by the artificial expression of aqp <dig> may be however insufficient for cryosurvival of cells or multicellular systems with large volumes, such as oocytes and embryos from lower vertebrates  <cit> . this may be related to a decreased translation efficiency of aqp <dig> when expressed in an heterologous system and/or a limited water and solute permeability of aqp <dig>  <cit> . in addition, aqp <dig> is ph-dependant  <cit> , and therefore, an effect of ph on aqp3-mediated water and cryoprotectant transport is likely to occur. this additional obstacle should be considered when using aqp <dig> in cryobiology as the intracellular ph is altered during volumetric changes in cells exposed to hypertonic or hypotonic environments  <cit> . furthermore, the intracellular ph can be affected by the presence of cryoprotectants within the cell as some of them are dipolar aprotic or protic solvents and act as hydrogen bond acceptors or proton donors, and affect the acid-base equilibrium in mixed solvent systems  <cit> . therefore, exploiting further the possibilities of using aquaporins in cryobiology, it would be useful to develop aquaporins with enhanced permeability or ph insensitivity, by investigating glps of non-mammalian origin that may be more permeable to water and cryoprotectants than mammalian aqp <dig> 

recently, we have characterized the genomic repertoire of zebrafish  aquaporins which contains seven glp isoforms: draqp3a and -3b, draqp <dig>  draqp9a and -9b, and draqp10a and -10b  <cit> . functional expression in xenopus laevis oocytes demonstrated that all the zebrafish glps transport water, glycerol and urea in a similar manner as the mammalian orthologs  <cit> , and therefore these channel proteins are of potential interest for cryobiology. in the present study, we have investigated both the ph sensitivity and cryoprotectant permeability of the zebrafish glps by using the x. laevis oocyte expression system. interestingly, we found that both draqp3a and -3b isoforms are much more permeable to ethylene glycol than to glycerol or propylene glycol at neutral or alkaline ph, while all other zebrafish glps, as well as human aqp <dig>  are more permeable to glycerol. since ethylene glycol is a suitable cryoprotectant, we further engineered two draqp <dig> mutants that were insensitive to changes in ph or exhibit enhanced ethylene glycol permeability.

RESULTS
effect of ph on water and cryoprotectant permeability of zebrafish glps and human aqp3
the effect of external ph on water permeability of x. laevis oocytes injected with capped rna  encoding draqp3a -3b, - <dig>  -9a, -9b, -10a, or -10b was determined by measuring the rate of swelling in hypotonic modified barth's medium  . for comparison, oocytes were injected with draqp1a or human aqp <dig> . the ph of the incubation medium affected the osmotic water permeability  of oocytes expressing hsaqp <dig>  draqp3a, -3b, - <dig>  and -10b, whereas the pf of oocytes injected with draqp1a, -9a, -9b, and -10a did not changed significantly within the range of ph tested. however, the effect of ph on oocyte pf relied on the specific expressed aquaporin. thus, the pf of oocytes expressing draqp <dig> was inhibited by approximately 50% at ph  <dig>  whereas the draqp10b oocytes, exhibiting very low water permeability at ph  <dig> and  <dig>  , showed an enhanced pf at ph. <dig>  . for oocytes expressing hsaqp <dig> or zebrafish aqp <dig> isoforms, the pf was inhibited at acidic ph but in a different manner. the pf of hsaqp <dig> oocytes was only partially inhibited  at ph  <dig>  whereas it remained similar at neutral and basic ph, as it has been described previously  <cit> . in contrast, the pf of draqp3a and -3b oocytes was completely abolished at ph  <dig>  and was higher at basic than at neutral ph. thus, in draqp3a oocytes the pf increased by 5- and 10-fold with respect the control oocytes at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, whereas the pf of draqp3b oocytes increased by  <dig> - and 11-fold at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. it thus appears that human aqp <dig> and the zebrafish orthologs exhibit different sensitivity to ph.

the permeability of x. laevis oocytes expressing hsaqp <dig> or zebrafish glps to the cryoprotectants glycerol, propylene glycol and ethylene glycol  at different ph was determined volumetrically. in these experiments, control and aquaporin-expressing oocytes were exposed to isotonic solutions containing  <dig> mm of the respective solutes and changes in oocyte volume were recorded during  <dig> min. in general, the solute permeability  of control oocytes and of oocytes expressing the different glps was affected by changes in ph . calculation of the oocyte ps as fold increase with respect that of the controls revealed that the ph changed the ps in a manner similar to the pf, except for oocytes expressing hsaqp <dig> which peg remained unchanged regardless of the ph of the medium . oocytes expressing draqp <dig>  -9a, -9b, -10a and -10b, or hsaqp <dig>  were significantly  more permeable to glycerol than propylene glycol or ethylene glycol at ph  <dig>  . in contrast, draqp3a or -3b oocytes exhibited significantly  higher permeability to ethylene glycol than to the other cryoprotectants at ph  <dig>  or  <dig> . at ph  <dig> , the peg of draqp3b oocytes was greatly enhanced resulting in bursting of the oocytes. to prevent this, oocytes were exposed to  <dig> mm ethylene glycol instead of  <dig> mm, confirming the stimulatory effect of increasing ph on the peg of oocytes expressing draqp3b .

data are the means ± sem  of 3- <dig> experiments performed on different batches of oocytes. due to natural variations in oocyte permeability between batches of oocytes, the ps of water-injected oocytes  is shown in parenthesis for each aquaporin. oocytes were injected with  <dig> ng  or  <dig> ng  crna, or with  <dig> nl of water. data from the same row with different superscript are statistically significant . nd, not determined.

 <dig> no data available for peg at ph  <dig>  because draqp3b-expressing oocytes burst in  <dig> mm ethylene glycol.

in order to assure that the effect of ph on the pf or peg of draqp3b-expressing oocytes was not affected by the dilution of the ion concentrations in the mbs solution, oocytes were equilibrated in isotonic mbs containing sucrose, and a lower concentration of nacl, prior to the swelling assays . these experiments confirmed that the pf or peg at different ph of oocytes expressing draqp3b was identical regardless of the ion concentrations of the bathing solutions , and therefore subsequent pf assays were carried out in diluted mbs.

to further determine whether the ethylene glycol permeability of oocytes expressing draqp3b was higher than that of oocytes expressing hsaqp <dig>  oocytes from the same batch were injected with increasing amounts of crna  encoding hsaqp <dig> or draqp3b . determination of the oocyte peg for each crna dose at ph  <dig>  showed that the peg of both hsaqp3- and draqp3b-injected oocytes reached a plateau with  <dig> ng crna, but the peg of draqp3b oocytes was significantly  higher than that of the hsaqp <dig> oocytes at all tested crna doses . since the oocyte expression system was apparently saturated with the same crna dose in hsaqp3- and draqp3b-expressing oocytes, the differences in peg were likely not derived from differences in translation efficiency. to confirm that draqp3b-expressing oocytes permeated ethylene glycol more efficiently than those expressing hsaqp <dig>  oocytes injected with  <dig> ng draqp3b or hsaqp <dig> crna were exposed to radiolabeled ethylene glycol. these experiments showed that the uptake of isotope-labeled ethylene glycol by draqp3b oocytes was approximately 70% higher than in hsaqp <dig> oocytes . altogether, these results suggested that draqp3b was more permeable to ethylene glycol than to propylene glycol or glycerol, and that draqp3b oocytes permeated ethylene glycol more efficiently than those expressing hsaqp <dig> 

development of draqp3b mutants ph insensitive or with enhanced water and ethylene glycol permeability
the finding that both zebrafish aqp <dig> isoforms were highly permeable to ethylene glycol prompted us to design aqp <dig> mutant constructs that would be ph insensitive or show enhanced ethylene glycol permeability. the design of the mutants was based on the draqp3b deduced amino acid sequence  since the corresponding crna was expressed apparently more efficiently in x. laevis oocytes than that of draqp3a. to characterize the draqp3b-wt and mutants, their crnas were expressed in oocytes and the pf monitored at different ph .

amino acid sequence of the five loops of wt and draqp3b mutants. the residues mutated and the substitutions are underlined in bold.

to design draqp3b constructs encoding aquaporins potentially ph insensitive, we targeted conserved residues that have been suggested to contribute to ph sensitivity in vertebrate and plant aquaporins, such as his, arg, glu and tyr  <cit>  . within the external loop a, fish and human aqp <dig> contain a his residue  that is conserved in killifish  aqp0a  , which is, as aqp <dig>  less permeable at acidic ph  <cit> . however, bovine  aqp <dig>  where the his in loop a is shifted one position  as compared to fhaqp0a , is more permeable at acidic ph  <cit> . expression of draqp3b-h53a  or -g54h  in oocytes led to a global decrease in water permeability with respect draqp3b-wt oocytes and did not affect ph sensitivity. by moving the his from position  <dig> to  <dig> , oocyte permeability at ph  <dig> was increased by 97%  with respect to draqp3b-wt oocytes. however, the permeability at ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  of oocytes expressing this mutant was reduced when compared with draqp3b-wt oocytes .

in the external loop c, the his <dig> of draqp3b is conserved in fhaqp3a and hsaqp <dig> . this residue in hsaqp <dig> has been proposed to participate in the ph regulation of water permeability  <cit> . in draqp3b, his <dig> was necessary for water permeability, since the pf at ph  <dig> and  <dig>  of oocytes expressing draqp3b-h154a, -g54h/h154a, -h53a/h154a or -h53a/g54a/h154a, was strongly diminished with respect to that of the draqp3-wt oocytes, although it was slightly less inhibited at ph  <dig>  .

since tyr residues have been reported to be implied in the ph sensitivity of hsaqp <dig>  <cit> , and arg residues may create electrostatic barriers that regulate aquaporin permeability  <cit> , we also investigated the effect of mutations in these residues. the tyr <dig> in the internal loop d of draqp3b is conserved in both fish and human aqp <dig> but not in other zebrafish glps and draqp1a . in addition, several arg and glu residues in the internal loop b  are highly conserved in vertebrate aqp <dig>  of which arg <dig> is retained in draqp <dig> and -10b that show decreased water permeability at ph  <dig> . however, all the mutations performed at these sites  did not affect significantly the pf at any ph , suggesting that these residues are not essential for water permeability or ph sensitivity in draqp3b.

the npa motifs, together with the aromatic residue/arginine  constriction region , are believed to be involved in proton exclusion and channel selectivity of aquaporins  <cit> . since draqp3b exhibits a particular feature within the first npa box, apparently conserved in the aqp3b of other teleosts  <cit> , where the ala residue is replaced by a thr , we investigated whether the thr <dig> of draqp3b can affect its permeability. the first npt motif of draqp3b was mutated into npa  and expressed in oocytes. two other mutants were produced bearing two npt motifs  or npa-npt motifs . the oocytes expressing draqp3b-t85a showed a significant   <dig> - and  <dig> -fold increase in pf with respect oocytes expressing draqp3b-wt at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, and had similar pf at neutral and alkaline ph . thus, substitution of thr by ala in the first npa box of draqp3b increased water permeability and completely abolished the stimulatory effect of alkaline ph, although permeability was still inhibited at ph  <dig>  expression of the draqp3b-a217t and -t85a/a217t mutants in oocytes decreased the pf with respect the oocytes expressing draqp3b-wt and did not affect the ph sensitivity of draqp3b .

since the draqp3b-h53a/g54h mutant displayed higher water permeability at ph  <dig> than the wt, and the draqp3b-t85a was more permeable and not affected by alkaline ph, we finally designed and characterized a triple mutant draqp3b-h53a/g54h/t85a . interestingly, the pf of oocytes expressing this construct was insensitive to ph, being  <dig> -fold higher than that of the draqp3b-wt oocytes at ph  <dig> . the pf of these oocytes was, however, 2- and  <dig> -times lower, respectively, than that of draqp3b-wt oocytes at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> .

the mutagenesis experiments rendered two constructs, draqp3b-t85a and - h53a/g54h/t85a, that encoded aquaporins with enhanced water permeability at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , or insensitive to ph, respectively. in order to characterize the expression levels and subcellular localization of the protein products of these mutants in x. laevis oocytes, immunocytochemistry and western blotting were carried out using an affinity-purified antibody against draqp3b. immunofluorescence microscopy of oocytes expressing draqp3b-wt, -t85a or -h53a/g54h/t85a revealed that in all cases the corresponding proteins were localized exclusively in the plasma membrane . western blot analysis of total membrane extracts of draqp3b-wt injected oocytes showed a broad and intense immunoreactive band of approximately 33- <dig> kda . this band corresponded to a glycosylated form of draqp3b, since treatment with n-glycosidase f  rendered a product of approximately  <dig> kda. immunoblotting of plasma membrane extracts treated with pngase f of oocytes injected with increasing amounts of draqp3b-wt, -t85a or -h53a/g54h/t85a showed that similar amounts of the protein products were accumulated at the oocyte plasma membrane . however, the draqp3b-h53a/g54h/t85a construct resulted in sligthly more protein at the plasma membrane in comparison with the other constructs when  <dig> ng crna was injected into the oocytes . since oocytes expressing this mutant had lower pf than the draqp3b-wt and -t85a oocytes at ph  <dig> , our observations confirmed that the differences in pf between oocytes expressing draqp3b-wt or the mutants were not derived from differences in translation or in the accumulation of the protein products in the oocyte membranes.

the permeability of oocytes expressing draqp3b-wt, -t85a or -h53a/g54h/t85a to ethylene glycol was finally investigated by radioactive uptake assays as described previously . the data indicated than the permeability to ethylene glycol of oocytes expressing the different constructs followed the same pattern as the pf. thus, the draqp3b-h53a/g54h/t85a oocytes showed higher ethylene glycol uptake than the other oocytes at ph  <dig>  and the uptake did not change at higher ph. in contrast, at ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  the draqp3b-t85a oocytes showed the highest ethylene glycol uptake.

permeability of draqp3b mutants under hypertonic conditions
the permeability to water and ethylene glycol of oocytes expressing hsaqp <dig>  draqp3b-wt, -t85a or -h53a/g54h/t85a was subsequently determined in hypertonic solutions . we first investigated the hydraulic conductivity  of oocytes expressing  <dig> ng of crna of the different constructs immersed in a sucrose solution . oocytes from all groups shrank quickly during approximately the first  <dig> min of sucrose exposure, and the shrinkage decreased thereafter, indicating that they were slowly reaching the equilibration state . as expected, aquaporin-expressing oocytes shrank faster than the controls, although the oocytes expressing draqp3b-t85a shrank more rapidly than the oocytes expressing the other constructs . since we observed that the shrinkage of oocytes in  <dig>  m sucrose was linear only during the first  <dig> min, we calculated the lp after  <dig> and  <dig> min; the lp at  <dig> min being more comparable to the pf previously determined under hypotonic conditions. accordingly, the lp values after  <dig> min of the draqp3b-t85a oocytes were the highest, followed by the oocytes expressing draqp3b-wt, -h53a/g54h/t85a, hsaqp <dig> and water-injected oocytes . after  <dig> min, the lp of the draqp3b-t85a oocytes remained higher than that of the other groups, whereas the lp of the draqp3b-wt, -h53a/g54h/t85a and hsaqp <dig> oocytes was similar and higher than the control oocytes . therefore, the results confirmed that the draqp3b-t85a mutant was also the most permeable to water under hypertonic conditions.

values  for water- and aquaporin-injected  oocytes are calculated from the data in figure 6a. data from the same column with different superscript are statistically significant .

next, we evaluated the lp and peg of oocytes expressing the different constructs under a high concentration gradient of ethylene glycol  for  <dig> min. for these experiments, we used oocytes expressing  <dig> or  <dig> ng of crna. the relative volume changes of the oocytes under these conditions revealed that water-injected oocytes shrank and did not swell for almost  <dig> min, suggesting that ethylene glycol permeated oocytes quite slowly . hsaqp3- and draqp3b-h53a/g54h/t85a-expressing oocytes  shrank slightly less than controls, and then swelled slowly, indicating a higher permeability to the cryoprotectant . the draqp3b-wt oocytes shrank less and swelled more than those injected with draqp3b-h53a/g54h/t85a- or hsaqp <dig>  whereas oocytes expressing draqp3b-t85a exhibited few shrinkage and the fastest re-swelling . accordingly, the lp values of the draqp3b-t85a oocytes in  <dig>  m ethylene glycol were the highest, followed by the draqp3b-wt, -h53a/g54h/t85a, hsaqp <dig>  and control oocytes . this was in agreement with the data obtained using oocytes exposed to  <dig>  m sucrose. the peg values also corroborated previous volumetric and ethylene glycol uptake experiments, since the peg of draqp3b-t85a oocytes was significantly  higher than that of the oocytes expressing the other constructs or injected with water . the reflection coefficients , calculated using the kedem-katchalsky model , were the lowest in aquaporin-expressing oocytes , suggesting that water and solute permeate through the same pore.

values  for water- and aquaporin-injected  oocytes are calculated from the data in figure 6b and c. for each crna dose, data with different superscript are statistically significant .

in general, oocytes injected with  <dig> ng of crna of each construct shrank less and swelled more rapidly over the  <dig> min period when compared with oocytes expressing  <dig> ng . for the draqp3b-t85a oocytes, however, no shrinkage was observed but the oocytes constantly swelled, probably reflecting a very fast permeation of ethylene glycol into the oocyte. consistently,  <dig> ng crna-injected oocytes had higher lp and peg values than those injected with  <dig> ng and, as observed before, oocytes expressing draqp3b-t85a showed the highest lp and peg values .

the internal concentration of ethylene glycol in water-injected oocytes and oocytes expressing the different constructs after immersion in hypertonic ethylene glycol was finally assessed. for these experiments, oocytes were exposed for  <dig> min to a solution of  <dig>  m ethylene glycol at ph  <dig>  containing radiolabeled ethylene glycol. the results confirmed that the uptake of the cryoprotectant was highly increased under a concentration gradient , since oocytes expressing  <dig> ng crna of the different constructs showed about 150-fold higher uptake rate of ethylene glycol than oocytes expressing  <dig> ng  or  <dig> ng  crna that were exposed to an isotonic ethylene glycol solution at the same ph. after  <dig> min in  <dig>  m ethylene glycol, the internal concentration of the cryoprotectant in oocytes injected with  <dig> o  <dig> ng crna of draqp3b-t85a was  <dig> - and  <dig> -times higher, respectively, than that of control oocytes . the ethylene glycol concentration in oocytes expressing  <dig> or  <dig> ng crna of draqp3b-wt, -h53a/g54h/t85a, and hsaqp <dig> was significantly  lower than that of draqp3b-t85a oocytes, but still higher than in control oocytes .

data are the mean ± sem  of two different experiments. data in parenthesis are in pmol/oocyte/min. values from the same column with different superscript are statistically significant .

discussion
in the present study, we have characterized the permeability of the complete repertoire of zebrafish glps to glycerol, propylene glycol and ethylene glycol in x. laevis oocytes. we found that the two zebrafish aqp <dig> isoforms, although ph dependent, are selectively more permeable to ethylene glycol than to glycerol or propylene glycol under isotonic conditions. using this property, apparently unique among vertebrate aquaporins, we have developed two mutant constructs based on the amino acid sequence of draqp3b. one of these mutants was ph insensitive when expressed in oocytes, whereas the other showed higher water and ethylene glycol permeability than the wt in both isotonic and hypertonic solutions.

it is known that some mammalian aquaporins are regulated by ph, namely aqp <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> . however, the effect of ph on the permeability of teleost glps has not been reported, except for aqp3a and -3b  <cit> . the results from the present study show that water, glycerol and propylene glycol permeability of oocytes expressing hsaqp <dig> at ph  <dig> was reduced to a similar extent as in previous studies, whereas permeability remained unchanged between ph  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . zebrafish aqp3a, -3b, - <dig> and -10b were affected to a variable degree by changes in ph when expressed in oocytes, although draqp3a and -3b were the most affected aquaporins. thus, water and cryoprotectant permeability of oocytes expressing draqp3a or -3b was completely abolished at ph  <dig> and was highest at ph  <dig> . such an effect of ph on aquaporin permeability, not observed in hsaqp <dig>  has been previously reported for the aqp3a and -3b from killifish and european eel, respectively  <cit> , but its physiological significance remains to be elucidated. the pf of oocytes expressing draqp <dig> or -10b was also diminished at acidic ph, but only by approximately 50%, a feature that has not been described for the mammalian orthologs.

determination of the pgly, ppg and peg of oocytes expressing the different zebrafish glps under isotonic conditions indicated that draqp3a and -3b were the only aquaporins more permeable to ethylene glycol than to glycerol or propylene glycol. hsaqp <dig> was more permeable to glycerol than to the other cryoprotectants under isotonic conditions at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , but under high concentration gradients hsaqp <dig> might transport propylene glycol and ethylene glycol as efficiently as glycerol, as it occurs for rat aqp <dig> expressed in x. laevis oocytes  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that in hypertonic solutions oocytes expressing draqp3a or -3b may be equally permeable to glycerol, propylene glycol and ethylene glycol. nevertheless, our results indicate that oocytes expressing draqp3b and exposed to isotonic or hypertonic ethylene glycol solutions permeate this cryoprotectant more efficiently than those expressing hsaqp <dig>  the draqp3b amino sequence shows the residues forming the ar/r narrowest constriction region conserved in glps, but interestingly, it shows an unusual first npa motif, where ala is substituted by thr. this amino acid change may be involved in the increased permeability of draqp3b to ethylene glycol with respect glycerol or propylene glycol, since npa motifs form one of the constriction sites of aquaporins responsible for proton exclusion and size selectivity  <cit> . however, the observation that changing the npt motif of draqp3b into npa increased both water and ethylene glycol permeability does not support this supposition. the molecular basis of draqp3b ethylene glycol selectivity remains thus unclear and needs to be investigated.

ethylene glycol is one of the most suitable cryoprotectants in terms of efficiency/toxicity ratio for the preservation of oocytes and embryos from higher vertebrates  <cit> , as well as from some fish species  <cit> , and therefore draqp3b may be more effective than mammalian aqp <dig> at increasing the internal concentration of ethylene glycol. water and solute transport through draqp3b is however ph sensitive being maximum at ph  <dig> . to counteract this obstacle, we investigated the role of sequence motifs in draqp3b potentially critical for ph regulation of water permeability, or that can enhance ethylene glycol permeability. mutagenesis experiments identified one his residue in loop a of draqp3b , spanning the outer region of the pore, which precise position within the loop regulated the inhibitory effect of acidic ph on water permeability. these observations are similar to those reported by németh-cahalan et al.  <cit>  for the fish and bovine aqp <dig>  in this study, it was suggested that ph can modulate the orientation of water molecules in the pore by titrating external his, which would in turn alter the orientation-dependant electrostatic interactions between water molecules, thus affecting their effective binding energies within the pore. in the present work, we also found that changing the first npt motif of draqp3b into npa  shifted the maximal permeability to ph  <dig> , allowing for higher water and ethylene glycol permeability at ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  with respect the wt. these findings suggest that thr <dig> of draqp3b is involved in the sensitivity of this aquaporin to alkaline ph. by combining these two observations, a triple mutant was designed  which was no longer ph sensitive , although it was less permeable at ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  than the wt.

increasing cell permeability to water and cryoprotectants, under high concentration gradients, is important for developing and improving cryopreservation protocols  <cit> . during slow and fast  cooling procedures employed for cryopreservation, cells have to be exposed to variable concentrations  of cryoprotectants  <cit> . our results suggest that mutated draqp3b, with improved cryoprotectant permeability, may be useful in cryobiology. the lp and peg of oocytes expressing hsaqp <dig>  draqp3b-wt, -t85a- or -h53a/g54h/t85a were measured here in a solution containing  <dig>  m ethylene glycol equivalent to that used in slow cooling protocols. for both 1- or  <dig> ng crna-injected oocytes, the lp and peg values were the highest for oocytes expressing draqp3b-t85a in agreement with previous observations using isotonic conditions and a solution of  <dig>  m sucrose. the peg values of oocytes injected with  <dig> ng of draqp3b-wt or -t85a and exposed to  <dig>  m ethylene glycol were  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> cm/min, respectively, whereas those of the hsaqp3-expressing oocytes were  <dig>  × 10- <dig> cm/min. yamaji et al.  <cit>  reported a peg of  <dig>  x10- <dig> cm/min of x. laevis oocytes expressing  <dig> ng of rat aqp <dig> and exposed to the same ethylene glycol concentration. our results therefore suggest that draqp3b-wt and -t85a may transport ethylene glycol more efficiently than human or rat aqp <dig>  however, the lp  and peg  of water-injected oocytes reported by yamaji et al.  <cit>  were 18- and 4-times lower, respectively, than those measured in our study  under the same conditions. the causes of these differences remain unknown, but they may be related with the observation that water-injected oocytes shrank faster in our study than those of yamaji et al.  <cit>  at a similar ethylene glycol concentration. also, we consistently measured a basal ethylene glycol permeation, under either isotonic or hypertonic solutions, in water-injected oocytes, in both swelling and radiolabeled solute uptake assays.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we have shown that the ph sensitiveness and ethylene glycol permeability of draqp3b can be altered by single or triple point mutations in its amino acid sequence. using this approach, we engineered and functionally characterized two mutant constructs, draqp3b-t85a- and -h53a/g54h/t85a, which were either more permeable to water and ethylene glycol than the draqp3b-wt or were ph insensitive, respectively. these artificial aquaporins may be useful for cryopreservation of large cells or multicellular systems, and investigations in this direction are underway.
