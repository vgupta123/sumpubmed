BACKGROUND
approximately 40% of the global human population is threatened by dengue epidemics, making it the most prevalent arboviral disease world-wide  <cit> . the main vector of dengue is the cosmopolitan mosquito, aedes aegypti. control of vector populations remains the primary line of defense for disease prevention due to the lack of a vaccine and effective antiviral drugs. successful deployment of vector control strategies with classical tools   <cit>  and novel control strategies based on genetically-modified mosquitoes requires knowledge of the genetic structure of mosquito populations.

considerable genetic variation in different traits has been documented in geographically-distinct ae. aegypti populations, including variability in genes that determine insecticide resistance and vector competence  <cit> . the study of genetic variation requires molecular markers  <cit> . aedes aegypti has a low abundance of microsatellite markers and limited  known restriction fragments length polymorphisms  and single-strand conformation polymorphism  markers  <cit> . consequently, the characterization of molecular markers is needed greatly in ae. aegypti.

rna-seq is a reliable methodology to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms  and has been used to do so in a number of species  <cit> . the standard rna-seq library preparation protocols target poly-adenylated rnas, thus restricting detection of snps to sequences encoding open-reading frames  and transcript untranslated regions . as a consequence, rna-seq approaches focus on “functional polymorphisms” and are more likely to identify adaptive rather than neutral genetic variability  <cit> . changes in open reading frames can affect protein sequences and consequently their structures and functions, while polymorphisms in utrs can alter regulatory elements or mirna binding sites influencing mrna stability and/or translation  <cit> .

we used rna-seq to identify sequence variation in the transcriptomes of three ae. aegypti strains, liverpool , chetumal  and rexville d-puerto rico . lvp is a long-standing laboratory-adapted strain and was used to generate the ae. aegypti reference-genome  <cit> . the ctm strain was derived in the early 2000s from mosquitoes collected in chetumal, mexico  <cit> . rexd originated in the early 1990s from mosquitoes collected in puerto rico  <cit> . our results provide insights into functional sequence variability in ae. aegypti.

RESULTS
rna-seq data summary
paired-end illumina rna-seq libraries were generated from rna samples extracted from lvp, ctm or rexd mosquitoes. rna samples from  <dig> mosquitoes , represented equally by sugar- and blood-fed females, were used for each library . paired-end sequencing of each cdna library generated total trimmed sequences of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  gigabase pairs  in length for ctm, rexd and lvp, respectively, with specific gene representation dependent on its expression level in the samples used to prepare the rna.

snp identification and classification
characterization of genes for in-depth snp analyses
a total of  <dig>  genes were found with rna-seq read coverage ≥ 90% of their transcript length in all three strains using cufflinks and the ae. aegypti genome annotation  as a strict reference. these genes had  <dig>  polymorphic sites  in lvp;  <dig>  in ctm and  <dig>  in rexd. polymorphic sites are loci with a nucleotide other than that assigned in the consensus reference genome  <cit> . polymorphic sites may include more than one allele because the rna-seq data were generated from pooled rna samples derived from  <dig> mosquitoes/strain. furthermore, some sites may be incorporated in more than one gene depending on gene orientation  and location .

we used read-coverage as a measure for nucleotide variant-calling confidence. depth of coverage was expressed in fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped fragments . an arbitrary cut-off of  <dig> fpkm, which is considered a moderate abundance level  <cit> , was used to identify genes for analyses of sequence polymorphisms. a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes had fpkm >  <dig> in lvp, ctm and rexd, respectively, with  <dig> common to all three strains . the  <dig> genes that in all three strains have rna-seq coverage over ≥ 90% of their transcript length and fpkm >  <dig> are referred to hereafter as “snp-genes ” .

properties of snp-genes and polymorphic sites
snp-genes are distributed over ~57%  of the ae. aegypti supercontigs that have annotated genes . the majority  of supercontigs with no snp-genes has only one annotated gene, but  <dig> had ≥  <dig> annotated genes. specifically, supercontig  <dig>  has  <dig> annotated genes, all of which are described as encoding structural constituents of cuticle. supercontig  <dig>  has  <dig> annotated genes,  <dig> of which encode cuticle constituents, eight are hypothetical proteins and the remaining five are associated with diverse functions such as metabolism, transcription, protein kinases, extracellular matrix glycoproteins and low-density lipoprotein receptors. fifteen of the supercontigs with no snp-genes  have 10– <dig> annotated genes that are predicted to encode hypothetical proteins or are associated with diverse functions including lipid metabolism, transport, nucleic acid binding, structural constituents of cuticle and oxido-reductase. these results indicate that genes encoding cuticular proteins are under-represented in the snp-genes. cuticular proteins are synthesized primarily by epidermal cells and their respective genes are transcribed during the larval stages  <cit> . this expression pattern may account for their absence or limited detection  when preparing rna-seq libraries from samples of rna derived from adults. similarly, other genes with tissue-specific or developmentally-regulated expression may not be included among the snp-genes. however, the numbers of annotated genes and snp-genes per supercontig have a positive correlation  , supporting the conclusion that these results and analyses can be generalized to the whole ae. aegypti genome and transcriptome.

the  <dig> snp-genes had a total of  <dig>  unique polymorphic sites with an alternative allele in at least one strain. totals of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  polymorphic sites were identified in snp-genes in lvp, ctm and rexd, respectively. this gives a density of polymorphic sites per  <dig> bp  of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  in lvp, ctm and rexd, respectively. the density of polymorphic sites was not dependent on fpkm, indicating that snp detection was not biased by rna-seq coverage . pairwise comparisons of ps/kb between corresponding supercontigs of two strains showed a significant difference in density distribution between lvp and both ctm and rexd, but not between ctm and rexd .

a total of  <dig> genes meeting snp-gene criteria had no polymorphisms, supporting the conclusion that these genes encode proteins with vital cellular functions . remarkably, half of these encode proteins with unknown functions while the others are associated with metabolic functions, transport or transcription/translation. one  of these  <dig> genes encodes the antimicrobial peptide cecropin. expression levels for all of these non-polymorphic genes were higher than  <dig> fpkm, with eight having fpkm >  <dig> in all strains, revealing that undetected polymorphisms, if existent, occur at a low frequency in the studied ae. aegypti strains.

effect of snps
the program snpeff  <dig>  was used to analyse the snps within the  <dig>  polymorphic sites identified and assess their effects on orfs and utrs. results are summarised by gene; consequently a snp may be counted more than once if it is included in the orfs or utrs of overlapping genes . most of the changes were associated with synonymous mutations, followed by changes in 3’utrs. between  <dig> and 29% of all detected snps were strain-specific .

sequence variation in immunity-related snp-genes
a total of  <dig> immunity-related genes are among the snp-genes. snps associated with non-synonymous mutations were prevalent in genes encoding b family clips, super-d, serpins, freps , c-type lectins, per of the hpx family, caspase   .

several functional categories of immunity-related snp-genes showed frequent polymorphisms in 3’utrs, and these are often strain-specific. these categories include: 1) autophagy-related genes such as apg <dig> , apg <dig> , apg4b , apg <dig> , and debcl , 2) ml-encoding genes such as ml <dig> , ml <dig>  ml <dig> , and ml <dig>  and 3) the genes rm62h  and rm62b , members of the piwi pathway and loqs , a member of the mirna pathway .

evidence for novel transcriptional units
rna-seq reads supported the discovery of  <dig>  novel transcriptional units  following cufflinks analysis using the ae. aegypti genome annotation  as a guide. the majority of these ntus  mapped outside a window of  <dig> base-pairs  from the 5’- and 3’-end boundaries of annotated exons . many of the identified ntus likely are unassigned extensions of exons or novel exons of genes annotated previously. however,  <dig> ntus mapped > <dig>  bp away from annotated exons. most ae. aegypti introns are shorter than  <dig>  bp   <cit>  providing strong support for the conclusion that we identified unassigned and un-annotated transcriptional units, most likely novel genes. further analyses of these  <dig> ntus show they are distributed over  <dig> supercontigs,  <dig> of which had no previously annotated gene . the majority  of the ntus encode products of unknown functions . blast2go searches attributed a putative function to ≤ 40% of the ntus.

the predominant functional attributes were different for ntus depending on their expression levels assessed by read coverage . transposon-related functions  were the most-represented functional category among the  <dig> ntus with low read coverage  in all three strains . metabolism  and signal transduction  were the most-represented categories among the  <dig> ntus with fpkm <  <dig>  diverse functions and signal transduction were represented highest among the  <dig> ntus with fpkm <  <dig>  only two proposed functions, lipoprotein receptor-related protein and a cytosolic large ribosomal subunit, could be assigned to the  <dig> ntus with fpkm >  <dig> 

discussion
we identified  <dig>  non-redundant polymorphic sites in the ae. aegypti transcriptome with at least one alternative nucleotide than what is present in the current genome annotation. our approach included three different strains of ae. aegypti and a large number of mosquitoes/strain , allowing sampling of  <dig> distinct haploid genomes for each strain. the covered genetic diversity combined with a stringent definition of a snp-gene  provide confidence that the polymorphisms identified represent legitimate allelic variations within and among strains. furthermore, the discovery of  <dig> ntus with fpmk ≥  <dig> in supercontigs previously annotated as containing no protein-encoding genes increases the representation of our data set.

this transcript-based approach to snp discovery is not a comprehensive survey of all genes because many may not have products represented in the specific tissues, stages and sexes of the selected samples. however, while our data show the under-representation of certain families of genes based on their expression profiles, the distribution of genes and snps across the annotated supercontigs supports the conclusion that we have a representative sample of the whole transcriptome. differential gene ontology representation among the ntus with respect to fpkm values most likely reflects the differences in samples sizes of clusters. the low representation of transposon-related transcripts supports the interpretation that these elements are not mobile in the developmental stages sampled.

the density of polymorphic sites in supercontigs and individual genes provides information that could be developed in analyses of selection pressures acting on each strain. future approaches using single mosquitoes and correlating the variation identified in polyadenylated rnas to the corresponding dna could map genomic regions that are under positive or negative selection in context of whole-genome evolution. our experimental design of applying rna-seq to pooled rna from a large number  of mosquitoes sampled at two different conditions  was a cost-efficient way to obtain enough depth of coverage to call single nucleotide variations with confidence within a strain. however, having pooled samples prevent us to infer the genotype of each mosquito and consequently apply conventional analyses of molecular evolution to our data.

the average ps/kb identified in ctm and rexd is slightly lower than the density of snps per kb previously detected in a survey of polymorphisms across coding and non-coding regions of  <dig> genes in the red-eye and moyo-r strains of ae. aegypti <cit>  and it is  <dig>  fold higher than that detected in lvp. the aaegl <dig>  genome annotation used for rna-seq read mapping and snp identification was derived from the lvp strain  <cit> , as a consequence our lvp polymorphism data reflect only variability within the strain. the same value calculated from other strains reflects both the within-strain variability and the variation between each strain and lvp.

there was no general correlation between expression level and snp density, as observed in yeast, fruit flies and salmon  <cit> . polymorphisms resulting in synonymous substitutions were the most numerous. the second most-abundant type of polymorphism detected was in 3’utrs. nucleotide diversity was heterogeneous both in terms of number and position of snps, supporting the view of the transcriptome as a mosaic of components with different evolutionary histories  <cit> .

the intragenic locations of polymorphisms in the snp-genes associated with immunity varied with functional class. polymorphisms were detected more frequently in the protein-encoding sequences of the clips, serpin and heme-containing peroxidases . in contrast, snps were more prevalent in the utrs of genes linked to autophagy, and ml-encoding genes. these findings are in agreement with a model in which some classes of immunity-related genes  maintain common transcribed regulatory features while diversifying their specificity while other classes appear to conserve their specificity while accommodating different regulatory domains. four of the five currently annotated thioredoxine peroxidase-encoding genes showed exclusively synonymous changes. these data correlate with hypotheses on the evolution of immunity-genes based on phylogenetic analyses that included culicidae species and drosophila melanogaster <cit> . thioredoxine peroxidases are thought to constitute the primary anti-oxidant system in insects, including d. melanogaster, anopheles gambiae and ae. aegypti, and their corresponding genes are conserved highly across mammals, fungi, worms and insects  <cit> . in contrast, hpx-encoding genes were found to be radiating faster with species-specific expansion through duplication in culicidae species and d. melanogaster <cit> . limited gene duplication was detected among the autophagy genes in d. melanogaster and three mosquito species , supporting the interpretation that selective constraints may exist. clip and serpin-encoding genes are in large gene families showing recent diversification, with particular expansion in ae. aegypti <cit> .

polymorphisms were found predominantly in 3’- and 5’-utrs in  <dig> of the  <dig> annotated ae. aegypti md2-like encoding genes. these data do not support phylogenetic analyses of md2-like encoding genes in ae. aegypti and an. gambiae that showed species-specific expansion and led to the hypothesis of a receptor activity for a broad spectrum of antigens for agmdl <dig> of an. gambiae <cit> . functions and molecular mechanisms of md2-like proteins have not been elucidated fully in mosquitoes and several md-like proteins have altered gene expression following dengue infection in salivary glands or whole mosquito bodies  <cit> .

snp-genes included  <dig> of the  <dig> annotated srna members,  <dig> of which showed strain-specific snps. representative members of the mirna and sirna pathways  showed changes in utrs more frequently than changes associated with non-synonymous substitutions. all but two of the non-synonymous changes identified in dcr <dig> across the lvp, ctm and rexd strains were identical to non-synonymous polymorphisms detected in wild-caught ae. aegypti from senegal, mexico and thailand and proposed to be under positive selection  <cit> . three additional snps in exon  <dig> of dcr <dig> associated with synonymous mutations also were detected in ae. aegypti from thailand  <cit> . laboratory-adapted strains of mosquitoes are expected to be less polymorphic than recent wild-derived lines due to genetic drift effects that result in reduced heterozygosity as a consequence of colony population structure. the similarity between the position of non-synonymous snps discovered in laboratory-adapted strains and wild-caught mosquitoes is an indirect validation of our data. the suite of snps presented here will be included in a larger snp array that will increase the power of association-mapping analyses  and greatly extend the number of molecular markers available for this species  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we analyzed the transcriptomes of three ae. aegypti strains, two that exhibit differential susceptibility to dengue- <dig> infection , and the strain  on which the available genome annotation is based. rna-seq data generated from  <dig> mosquitoes of each strain supported the identification of  <dig> ntus, mostly with unknown functions, underscoring the need for continuous refinement of the current genome annotation.

we adopted a conservative approach to select genes for snp analyses based on their rna-seq coverage, requiring 90% minimum read coverage of each gene length, support for moderate expression level  and representation in all three strains. the identified  <dig> “snp-genes” that meet these criteria show an unbiased distribution across the genome and absence of functional clustering.

we further assessed the effect of the identified snps with respect to the annotated coding sequence and provide a summary of data for all snp-genes. a dedicated analysis of immunity-related genes in the snp-genes revealed differences in prevalence of types of polymorphisms according to functional categories, which mostly recapitulated results from phylogenetic analyses that included ae. aegypti, an. gambiae and d. melanogaster, but also revealed differences between ae. aegypti and an. gambiae. validation of the methodology used here for snps characterization is provided by the concordance between non-synonymous substitutions detected in dcr <dig> in this and previous surveys of five wild ae. aegypti populations.

the surge of dengue cases in the past  <dig> years, partly dependent on the expansion of its vectors species range, calls for urgent and innovative control measures  <cit> . genetic-based control strategies represent a novel, rapidly-progressing approach  <cit> . two transgenic lines have reached field-testing validation stage and two lines show a transmission-blocking phenotype in the laboratory  <cit> . the observed sequence polymorphisms and variation in expression profiles across different ae. aegypti strains support the conclusion that a synthetic-approach for the development of effector genes would probably be more effective in achieving species-specificity, while maintaining efficacy across geographically-distinct populations  <cit> .
