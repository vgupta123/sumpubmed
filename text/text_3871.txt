BACKGROUND
cytotoxic t lymphocytes  and natural killer  cells deliver their cytolytic effector molecules via so-called secretory lysosomes . these organelles contain a number of cytotoxic proteins and undergo regulated secretion in response to external stimuli, for example to eliminate virus-infected and tumorogenic cells by the induction of apoptosis. in most eukaryotic cells, lysosomes are acidic organelles equipped with hydrolases to degrade and recycle endogenous or exogenous biomolecules  <cit> . interestingly, in various hematopoietic cell lineages associated with secretory effector functions , a subset of lysosomes gained a second function as a storage and transport vehicle for effector molecules  <cit> . similarly, outside the immune system, melanocytes utilize a comparable organelle to regulate pigmentation  <cit> .

in mast cells, histamine and serotonin are the key factors associated with sl, whereas in macrophages, for example mhc molecules and cytokines are stored and transported via this compartment  <cit> . as mentioned, sl of mature t and nk cells are characterized by the presence of cytotoxic effector molecules including perforin  <cit> , granzymes  <cit> , granulysin  <cit> , and the tnf family protein fasl   <cit> . interestingly, the 'packaging' of individual effector molecules is quite different. granzymes and perforins appear to be stored at least in part in association with carrier proteins  in the vesicular lumen to form dense core particles  <cit> . in contrast, the fasl is a transmembrane protein that in fact might be 'directly' involved in the transport of sl during organelle maturation and effector responses. during maturation, fasl is transported to sl by sh <dig> domain proteins interacting with its proline-rich c-terminus. subsequently, fasl might participate in connecting sl to the actin-cytoskeleton via its interaction with nck and associated actin-regulatory proteins  <cit> .

genetic diseases based on defects of the secretory machinery such as the chédiak-higashi syndrome , the hermansky-pudlak syndrome  or the griscelli syndrome  are characterized by a combination of immunodeficiency and albinism, reflecting the close relationship of the sl-related secretory pathway in hematopoietic cells and melanocytes as non-hematopoietic cells  <cit> . although the genetic defects have been mostly deciphered, their influence on the overall protein composition of secretory lysosomes is not completely understood. of note, a number of mouse strains are available that reflect the pathophysiology in patients. as an example, lyst-deficient mice are the murine counterpart of chs and thus suffer from immunodeficiency and also carry a respective fur phenotype . cells of such mice harbor giant lysosomes, indicating that the lysosomal maturation and storage might still be operational, while exocytosis and recycling are severely impaired  <cit> .

for the detailed analysis of the proteomic profile of sl, it is important to efficiently enrich or purify this compartment from a limited number of cells. in  <dig>  a first density gradient centrifugation protocol was developed to purify organelles from rat hepatocytes using a non-ionic x-ray contrast compound termed metrizamide  <cit> . compared to traditional sucrose gradients, the advantage of metrizamide was a much lower osmolarity that enabled adequate separation of lysosomes and mitochondria without artificially altering their density as for instance observed with triton wr <dig>  <cit>  or dextran  <cit> . in the meantime, several non-ionic iodinated density gradient media have been developed, which are often derivatives of metrizoic acid, for example nycodenz and its dimer iodixanol -bis]bis [n, n'-bis. the major advantage of iodixanol in this context is its ability to form iso-osmotic solutions at high densities   <cit> . in  <dig>  graham et al. first described the usage of iodixanol as density gradient media and provided a first set of subcellular isolation protocols  <cit> .

another standard gradient medium that also offers lower osmolarity and viscosity is percoll™. it consists of colloidal silica coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone . in the last three decades, percoll™ gradients were not only used to separate lymphocyte subpopulations but also to isolate cytotoxic granules of nk  <cit>  and t cell lines  <cit> . recently, several percoll-based isolation protocols were compared with regard to the functionality of effector molecules in the obtained fractions in cytotoxicity assays  <cit> . a major disadvantage of percoll™ as a separation medium is that silica often has to be removed from the obtained fractions because it might interfere with downstream applications. unfortunately, however, such washing steps are mostly accompanied by the loss of organelle integrity.

here, we describe a rapid and reliable iodixanol-based subcellular fractionation protocol that allows the substantial enrichment of intact secretory vesicles for example from in vitro expanded lymphocyte populations. importantly, the obtained fractions are compatible with standard analyses such as western blotting and even with cydye labeling for subsequent high-resolution two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis  <cit> .

RESULTS
subcellular fractionation
for the purification of lysosomal fractions, we applied a low osmotic medium for density gradient centrifugation. following primary organelle enrichment by differential centrifugation, the subcellular compartments were separated on a discontinuous iodixanol gradient . individual fractions were collected from the top of the gradient and the protein content of the six obtained fractions  was quantified using a bradford protein assay. equal amounts of protein were then separated by sds-page and analyzed by western blotting for the presence of characteristic organelle marker proteins . in order to define the major lysosomal fraction, western blots were stained for cd <dig>  and cd107a  as classical lysosome-associated membrane proteins and for cd <dig>  and perforin as characteristic marker proteins for secretory lysosomes of t and nk cells  <cit> . in addition, we stained for vti1b, a membrane-bound snare protein that is thought to function in the regulation of post-golgi vesicle trafficking and secretory pathways  <cit> . as detailed in figure 2a, all putative marker proteins for secretory lysosomes and also vti1b were enriched in fraction  <dig> of the final iodixanol gradient. at the same time, this putative secretory lysosomal fraction  <dig> did not contain golgin <dig>  a marker for golgi cisternae  <cit> , or coxiv as a marker for mitochondria  <cit> , or catalase as an indicator for peroxisomes  <cit> . furthermore, all iodixanol fractions were not stained with an anti-pan-cadherin antibody indicating that they are devoid of contaminating plasmamembrane fragments that were readily removed during the first differential centrifugation step. it should be mentioned, however, that organelle separations by density gradients should not be regarded as purifications but rather as enrichment procedures. following our protocol, we thus found bip/grp <dig>  a marker for the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> , and eea- <dig>  a marker for early endosomes  <cit>  as 'contaminants' in the putative lysosomal fraction  <dig>  interestingly, granzyme b and granulysin, two cytotoxic effector molecules that are known to be present in secretory vesicles  <cit>  were also present in other fractions. in case of granulysin, the long  form of  <dig> kda was selectively enriched in fraction  <dig> whereas the mature form  was detected in all fractions with the highest abundance in fractions  <dig> and  <dig>  similarly, granzyme b was detected in fractions 2– <dig>  again with the strongest signals after western blotting in fractions  <dig> and  <dig>  most importantly, however, if putative sl were enriched from different fasl-containing cell populations, including stable jurkat transfectants , in vitro expanded cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, or nk cells, we consistently noted a substantial enrichment of this marker protein in the respective fraction  <dig> .

electron micrographs of isolated vesicles
to verify whether the obtained fractions contain intact vesicles, isolated granules of  <dig> days old pha blasts corresponding to fractions  <dig> and  <dig> were fixed and processed for electron microscopical inspection as detailed in the material and methods section. as shown in figure  <dig>  round membrane-enclosed organelles with a characteristic electron density and a diameter between  <dig> and  <dig> nm formed a predominant organelle population in fraction  <dig> . in contrast, the predominant structures in fraction  <dig> were slightly smaller, membrane-enclosed and somehow polar vesicles that were mainly characterized by a much higher electron density .

2d-dige of enriched secretory granules
in order to analyze the robustness of our purification protocol, pha-stimulated lymphocytes of two healthy donors were expanded in vitro for  <dig> days. after differential and density gradient centrifugation, the obtained organelles of fraction  <dig> were pelleted and lyzed in 2d lysis buffer. for the subsequent 2d-dige analysis,  <dig> μg of enriched sl  of donor  <dig> were labeled with cy <dig> and  <dig> μg of sl of donor  <dig> with cy <dig>  the samples were combined, spiked with  <dig> μg each of unlabeled fraction  <dig> protein and subjected to isoelectric focusing on an ipg strip  in the first dimension and a conventional sds-page  for the second dimension. a characteristic protein distribution along with the initial analysis using the decyder® software package is shown in figure  <dig>  as indicated by the yellow color in the overlay , the two fractions were extremely similar although the original cells were derived from two different donors, expanded for more than two weeks and both samples were isolated on separate gradients. the high reproducibility of the lysosomal enrichment using individual biological samples is also reflected in the graphical depiction of the spot distribution . using standard settings, of the  <dig> included proteins,  <dig> were marked different with a threshold set to  <dig>  fold and only  <dig> with a threshold set to  <dig> fold. of note, a threshold of  <dig>  is equivalent to a two-fold square deviation of the spot volumes and results in a variance of approximately  <dig> % of the calculated protein content.

peptide mass fingerprinting of selected spots
in order to identify selected differentially represented spots by peptide mass fingerprinting , individual spots were automatically picked using an ettan spotpicker. tryptic digestion was performed as described before  <cit>  and eluted peptides were dried, resuspended in maldi matrix and spotted on maldi targets. the subsequent pmf analyses revealed differences for example in mhc class ii molecules , gelsolin-like capping protein isoforms  and in chaperonin containing tcp <dig>  subunit  <dig>  between the two samples .

similarity of individual sl preparations
we also wanted to know whether enriched secretory lysosomes of individual t cell subpopulation show a comparable protein pattern. to this end, we isolated cd4+ t cells of three different donors by magnetic-activated cell sorting. individual fraction  <dig> samples were compared by 2d electrophoresis on separate gels stained with flamingo pink. scanning, data acquisition and individual intra-gel comparisons using the image master  <dig>  software package again revealed a highly similar protein pattern in all samples . the average correlation coefficient in scatter plot images was  <dig>  . of note, this coefficient can vary between - <dig> and  <dig>  with an absolute value of  <dig> indicating the perfect fit. as a conclusion, the proteomic profiles of enriched fraction  <dig> sl of separately expanded cd4+ t cell populations of three different donors are indeed very similar with only a few proteins being differentially expressed.

discussion
in the present study we describe a reliable protocol for the enrichment of intact secretory vesicles for the subsequent detailed analysis of this subcellular compartment. combinations of differential and density gradient centrifugation procedures are widely used to isolate organelle fractions. iodinated, low osmotic media are advantageous in this context not only because of their low osmolarity but also because they lack silica, which might interfere with organelle integrity and subsequent analyses. since the density of lysosomes might vary depending on the cell or tissue type, an optimization of gradient sizes and concentrations, as well as centrifugation setting is required to obtain reproducible results. we optimized this protocol for the rapid and reproducible enrichment of secretory lysosomes of lymphocyte subpopulations. using this methodology, we already defined the sl proteome of nk cell lines and primary nk cells  <cit> . in the present study, we tested the reproducibility and reliability of the procedure by comparing purified sl fractions of polyclonal activated t cell populations  and subpopulations  of different donors by subsequent western blotting and high-resolution 2d difference gel electrophoresis. we show that the sl fractions of t cells from healthy donors are very similar with regard to the overall protein content, with only minor differences in mhc molecules or associated transporter proteins or chaperons. thus, this methodology is apparently ideal as basis for the detailed investigation of consequences of genetic alterations associated with lysosomal transport and storage diseases.

one initial key step of organelle preparation is the disruption of the cells. we applied a mild dounce homogenization and empirically determined the number of strokes for optimal cell opening with minimal damage to organelles and nuclei by trypan blue staining. the first centrifugation step efficiently removed intact cells, nuclei  and associated plasma membrane fragments . since mitochondria are more sensitive to hydrostatic pressure  <cit> , bottom loading of density gradients caused an increase in their density relative to that of lysosomes. as reported before, we also noted that in iodinated density gradient media such as iodixanol, lysosomes tend to better separate from mitochondria or peroxisomes than in silica-based percoll media  <cit> .

the interphases containing individually enriched organelles can be removed from the top of the gradient or by perforation of the centrifugation tube with a suitable needle. we routinely collected the samples from the top of the tubes. in our study, the individual fractions were analyzed by western blotting for the presence of marker proteins for secretory lysosomes , cd107a  and cd <dig> ), mitochondria , peroxisomes , er , golgi  and early endosomes . although contaminations of lysosomal fractions with mitochondria often hamper analyses of lysosomes obtained by density gradient centrifugation, the use of a discontinuous iodixanol® separation gradient resulted in a clear separation of cox iv containing mitochondria  and secretory lysosomes characterized by the presence of lamp- <dig>  cd <dig> and fasl . besides the enrichment of fasl and lysosomal membrane proteins, which is indicative for the enrichment of sl in fraction  <dig>  we observed a rather high abundance of other cytotoxic effector molecules  in fractions  <dig> and  <dig> . the presence of effector molecules in separate intact electron dense fraction  <dig> granules  was unexpected. employing the separation method described here, we are currently investigating and comparing the composition of the two vesicular structures in different t and nk cell populations in more detail. we think that the distinct sl/granules actually form two separate compartments that might arise from an initial multivesicular complex during vesicular maturation. fractions  <dig> and  <dig> not only differ substantially in the content of effector molecules but also in proteins that regulate cytoskeletal association . of note, since the described purification protocol does not imply nucleases and results in intact granules as shown by electron microscopy , enriched sl  should be suitable to assay their capacity to directly induce target cell apoptosis by standard dna fragmentation or chromium release assays as described before by trapani and colleagues  <cit> .

importantly, the relatively high number of cells  needed as an input for the enrichment of secretory vesicles is easily achievable if one wants to analyze leukemic cell lines or murine or human t cell or nk cell populations. to demonstrate the reproducibility and reliability of this technique, we isolated enriched secretory lysosomes of pha stimulated lymphocytes of two different donors and compared these fractions by 2d-difference gel electrophoresis. this direct comparison at high-resolution revealed an almost identical spot pattern , indicating that the presence and also the abundance of the approximately  <dig> individual proteins in these enriched fractions are highly conserved in biological replicates. to stress this point: if one compares the different fractions from one donor, the protein content is completely different .

since we were interested in the few differences between the two samples, we picked four selected spots and identified the proteins by mass spectrometry. although only  <dig> μg of total protein were separated on the respective gels, even low abundant spots  were identified. it is important to mention that spot picking was performed from flamingo pink stained gels since we and others noted that cydye minimal labeling results in significant alterations of protein masses, especially of low molecular weight proteins  <cit> . since only 3% of a given protein is labeled by the employed minimal labeling procedure, 97% of the protein might be actually located below the initially detected protein spot. nonetheless, the subsequent pmf analyses revealed differences in mhc class ii molecules, gelsolin-like capping protein isoforms and in chaperonin containing tcp <dig>  subunit  <dig> between the two samples . without going into further details, these or related proteins have been associated with secretory vesicles in other studies before  <cit> . in a recent study, we provided a detailed analysis of the proteome of enriched sl from different nk cell lines and primary nk cells  <cit> . we identified roughly  <dig> protein spots representing  <dig> individual proteins. as a proof of principle, although in nk cells the overall protein content of isolated sl was also very similar, we described a heterogeneous profile of functionally relevant proteins in leukemic and primary nk cells.

the reliability of the presented protocol is further stressed by the comparison of sl from cd4+ t cells isolated from three different donors. of note, most cd4+ t cells also gain cytotoxic potential associated with sl when expanded in vitro  <cit> . as expected from the initial 2d-dige experiments on pha blasts, also standard 2d gel electrophoresis followed by flamingo pink staining and indirect comparison of individual gels using image master software revealed a very high degree of similarity between the individual fraction  <dig> preparations . this notion is highly relevant since future proteome analyses need to be standardized and suitable to compare appropriate numbers of samples for statistical analyses  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we describe a reliable, reproducible and easy to perform method for the enrichment of secretory lysosomes. we demonstrate that enriched sl fractions of individual donors or lymphocyte subpopulations are almost identical in their overall protein content. we thus provide a standard protocol for the future comparison of this important compartment in different t and nk cell subpopulations, in untransformed and transformed cells, and in t and nk cell populations of patients or mice suffering from genetically caused lysosomal storage diseases. furthermore, the protocol might be easily adapted to investigate lysosomes of other cellular origin, including macrophages, mast cells or melanocytes.
