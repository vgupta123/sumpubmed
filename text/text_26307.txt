BACKGROUND
acanthamoebae polyphaga mimivirus was described for the first time in  <dig>  <cit> . it was isolated from amoebae growing in water sample from a cooling tower during an outbreak of pneumonia in an english hospital. compared to other members of the nucleo-cytoplasmic large dna viruses  family  <cit> , apm has very particular characteristics due to its size, structure, genome sequence  <cit> , and replication cycle through a specific virus factory  <cit> . the virus particle was shown to be icosahedral, with a capsid shell diameter of  <dig> Å covered by long fibers and appears to have at least two lipid membranes beneath its capsid protein  <cit> . the apm  <dig> -mb genome encodes at least  <dig> proteins   <cit> . proteomic analysis of proteins extracted from purified viral particles allowed the identification of  <dig> proteins including the capsid protein d13l, coded by the l <dig> gene. the d13l capsid protein was shown to be the most abundant and major glycoprotein of apm  <cit>  and is thought to be the main component of the outermost protein shell layer. the protein sequence was deduced from the first available methionine codon in the l <dig> open reading frame. recently, based on mass spectrometry analysis of the capsid protein d13l peptides, the original protein sequence was revised and completed with  <dig> supplementary n-terminal amino-acids    <cit>  and thereafter named here capsid protein  <dig>  the aim of this study was to characterize the full length apm capsid protein  <dig> coding gene and to provide new insights into the structure of the protein. blast of the capsid protein  <dig> coding sequence on the apm genome sequence revealed that the start codon might be located  <dig> bp upstream from the start codon of the previously annotated l <dig> coding gene. we produced a recombinant full length capsid protein  <dig> and specific monoclonal antibodies  that might be useful to develop further structural analysis or detection assays.

methods
cdna cloning and sequencing
total rna from uninfected or apm infected a. polyphaga was extracted using rneasy extraction kit  as previously described  <cit> . the capsid protein  <dig> cdna was synthsesized from apm infected a. polyphaga rna by using the superscript one-step rt-pcr with platinum taq kit  with the following primers:

q5uql7ncoif: 5'-gaaggagatataccatggcaggtggtttactccaatta-3' and q5uql7smair: 5'-gatgagaaccccccccgggattactgtacgctaatccg-3'. underlined are the apm l <dig> gene specific sequences: nt  <dig>  <dig> –  <dig>  <dig> for the forward primer; nt  <dig>  <dig> –  <dig>  <dig> for the reverse primer. the resulting  <dig> bp cdna fragment was then cloned into the pivex  <dig>  expression vector  at the ncoi and smai sites. recombinant plasmids were selected, purified and then incorporated into the d-rhodamine terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction buffer kit with amplitaq polymerase fs . reaction products were resolved by using an abi  <dig> automated sequencer and sequence analysis was performed using the software package abi prism dna sequencing analysis software version  <dig>  . t <dig> promoter and t <dig> terminator primers were used as well as two primer pairs targeting internal regions of the cdna: quql7-sf1: 5'-gctggcagtagtaattctgc-3'; quql7-sr1: 5'-gcagaattactactgccagc-3'; and qu5ql7-sf2: 5'-gaaggtaatgatggtagaag-3'; qu5ql7-sr2: 5'-cttctaccatcattaccttc-3'.

rt-pcr analysis
rna was extracted from uninfected or apm-infected amoebae at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours post infection.  <dig> ng of each rna was submitted to rt-pcr amplification using the superscript one-step rt-pcr kit  with the q5uql7ncoif/q5uql7smair primer pair. cdna synthesis was performed in one cycle of  <dig> minutes at 50°c,  <dig> minutes at 94°c and subsequent pcr reaction with  <dig> cycles of  <dig> seconds at 94°c,  <dig> seconds at 60°c,  <dig> seconds at 72°c, and one cycle of  <dig> minutes at 72°c. amplified products were analysed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel. generuler  <dig> kb dna ladder  was used as a dna size marker.

expression of the recombinant capsid protein 1
expression of the capsid protein  <dig> was performed using a cell-free translation system  <cit> , the high yield rts  <dig> escherichia coli circular template kit . reactions were performed at 30°c for  <dig> h, with a stirrer speed of  <dig> rpm, with  <dig> μg of recombinant plasmid used as dna template. the rts sample was then centrifuged for  <dig> min at  <dig>  <dig> rpm and the pellet was resuspended in laemmli buffer, heated for  <dig> min at 95°c, resolved by  <dig> % sds-page, followed by coomassie blue staining or transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblot analysis using a anti-histidine monoclonal antibody. the recombinant capsid protein  <dig> was extracted from polyacrylamide gels by the electroelution method using the elutatube™ protein extraction kit  according to the manufacturer's protocol and used to immunise mice for the production of monoclonal antibodies.

monoclonal antibodies production
three six week-old female balb/c mice were inoculated three times intraperitoneally at 14-days interval with  <dig> μg electroeluted protein mixed with  <dig> μg aluminium hydroxide and  <dig> μg cpg as previously described  <cit> . four days after the last immunisation, spleen cells fusion was performed with x <dig> ag  <dig>  myeloma cells  using 50%  <dig> polyethylene glycol . cells were grown in rpmi medium  with 15% heat inactivated fetal calf serum  and hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine selective medium  at 37°c with 5% co <dig>  hybridoma supernatants were screened  <dig> days after by elisa using plates coated overnight with  <dig> μg/ml of apm extract in sodium carbonate buffer  <dig> mm, ph  <dig> . positive hybridomas were subcloned by limiting dilution and submitted to isotyping using a mouse monoclonal isotyping kit . hybridomas producing the highest mab titers were then subcloned, expanded, and tested by western blot analysis using apm extract subjected to 2d gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose.

2d-gel electrophoresis
apm particles were purified through a 25% sucrose gradient and apm extract was prepared for 2-d gel electrophoresis as previously reported  <cit> . immobiline™ drystrips  were rehydrated overnight using  <dig> μl rehydration buffer  containing  <dig> μg of solubilized apm proteins and ief was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol . before the second dimension electrophoresis was performed, strips were equilibrated twice in  <dig> ml equilibration buffer  for  <dig> min. this buffer was supplemented with  <dig> mm dtt for the first equilibration and with  <dig> mm iodoacetamide for the second one. the strips were then embedded in  <dig> % agarose and the proteins resolved by 10% sds-page . gels were stained either with silver or transferred onto nitrocellulose for western blot analysis using capsid protein  <dig> specific mab; anti-phosphothreonine, anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-phosphoserine  mabs; or rabbit polyclonal antiserum anti-methylated lysine . the detection of glycosylated proteins in 2d gels was performed according to the pro-q emeral  <dig> glycoprotein stain kit's procedure  and visualized using a  <dig> nm uv illuminator.

RESULTS
the l <dig> gene  was originally annotated as being the apm d13l capsid protein coding sequence. further mass spectrometry identification of d13l capsid peptides allowed suhre et al. to submit a protein sequence completed with  <dig> n-terminal aa  <cit> . using tblastn  <cit>  the coordinates of the corresponding nucleotide sequence on the apm genome appeared to be: nt  <dig>  <dig> –  <dig>  <dig> ; nt  <dig>  <dig> –  <dig>  <dig>  and nt  <dig>  <dig> –  <dig>  <dig> . this result suggested the existence of two untranslated regions: intron  <dig>   <dig> bp long,  and intron  <dig>   <dig> bp long  .

based on this sequence, outermost 5'- and 3'-terminal primers, q5uql7ncoif and q5uql7smair respectively, were designed to determine the capsid protein  <dig> gene structure. rna was extracted from apm-infected a. polyphaga and used to synthetise full length l <dig> cdna. we then cloned the full-length cdna into an expression vector and sequenced the target gene. comparison of the cdna sequence  with the apm genomic dna sequence confirmed that the capsid protein  <dig> gene is  <dig> bp long and consists of three exons interrupted by two introns . this result supposed that splicing events might occur during gene transcription and/or rna maturation. to gain insight into this possibility, rt-pcr analyses were performed on rna extracted at different time from apm-infected a. polyphaga using the q5uql7ncoif/q5uql7smair primer pair . agarose gel electrophoresis showed a fragment, about  <dig> bp long, amplified from apm genomic dna , and a fragment, about  <dig> bp long, from infected cell rna , while no fragment was amplified from uninfected cell rna . only fully spliced mrna was detected from t <dig> to t <dig> p.i., with an increased signal. no precursor rna could be identified. detection of capsid protein  <dig> mrna as soon as t <dig> was not surprising since this rna was shown to be packaged within the viral particle  <cit> . additional rt-pcr experiments performed using primer pairs able to detect the potential different forms of spliced capsid protein  <dig> rna were unsuccessful to demonstrate alternative forms of spliced rna whatever the time post-infection .

the full length  <dig> bp capsid protein  <dig> cdna codes a  <dig> aa polypeptide with an estimated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and theoretical isoelectric point of  <dig> . the full length cdna was cloned into the pivex  <dig>  expression vector, producing a c-terminal his-tagged recombinant protein. analysis of the purified recombinant protein revealed an apparent molecular weight of  <dig>  kda, in accordance with the calculated one . expression of capsid protein  <dig> was also successful in e. coli bl <dig>  plyss. the protein was found in the unsoluble fraction and western blot analysis using anti-his antibodies revealed the same pattern as with the in vitro translated protein .

analysis of proteins extracted from purified apm particles, resolved by 2d gel electrophoresis, revealed after silver staining the typical electrophoresis pattern of apm proteins with the capsid protein  <dig> appearing as four spots under silver staining with an apparent  <dig>  kda molecular weight . monoclonal antibodies  produced against the recombinant full length capsid protein  <dig> were used for western blot analysis of apm extract resolved by 2d gel analysis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. the anti-capsid protein  <dig> mab p9a <dig> recognized the spots previously identified by mass spectrometry as the capsid protein d13l . it was previously shown that rabbit or mouse polyclonal antisera prepared against purified viral particles were unable to recognize any of these spots and that the d13l capsid protein was shown to be glycosylated  <cit> . apm capsid protein  <dig> contains several ser, thr or asn residues predicted to be n- or o-glycosylated, according to sequence analysis using the expasy proteomics server   <cit> , but has no signal peptide. the absence of signal peptide suggests that apm capsid protein  <dig> potential glycosylation sites are unlikely to be exposed to host cell glycosyltransferases. it has been shown in the pbcv <dig> vp <dig> capsid protein that n-glycosylation sites around asn residues do not obey the consensus nx motif, meaning that glycosylation may occur via the virus encoded glycosyltransferases rather by the host ones  <cit> . this may also be the case for apm capsid protein  <dig>  other post-translational modifications were investigated such as aa phosphorylation or methylation. apm capsid protein  <dig> appeared to be phosphorylated on serine , threonine or tyrosine residues but was not methylated .

the former coding sequence assignment for the genel <dig> was shown to be homologous to vp <dig>  the major capsid proteins of paramecium bursaria chlorella virus  <dig>  and other large dna viruses  <cit> . the full length apm capsid protein  <dig> expressed from the l <dig> gene exhibited even higher sequence identity with vp <dig> with 46% identity in the n-terminal region  and 40% in the c-terminal region . the apm capsid protein  <dig> is overall 45% identical to that of the chlorella virus pbcv <dig>   <cit>  but  <dig> amino-acids are inserted at a position of a stretch of  <dig> residues in the chlorella virus capsid protein, between trp <dig> and ser <dig> . the insertion has several distinct features: i) it is located at the external face of the apm capsid protein 1; ii) it does not belong to the two «jelly roll» motifs of the core, as found in pbcv <dig> capsid protein; iii) it replaces a group of  <dig> n-linked sugar, either because asn residues are in the deletions/insertions sequence areas  or are absent; and iv) it is predominantly structured as a motif of about  <dig> β-strands according to the psipred protein structure prediction server  <cit> . such a high β-strand contain is reminiscent of β-sandwich folds. the structure of pbcv <dig> capsid is known  <cit>  and is shown in figure 4b. this structure is formed of two «jelly roll» motifs as found in many other viruses  <cit> . compared to the pbcv <dig> capsid structure, the apm capsid protein  <dig> insertion might be very proeminent. it contains  <dig> cysteine residues, on top of the  <dig> present in the core domain. it should be noticed that pbcv <dig> contains only  <dig> cysteine residues, none of them involved in disulfide bridges. the presence of these conserved domains in the capsid proteins of large dsdna viruses strengthens the hypothesis that the capsomer structure of apm should be similar to other large dsdna icosahedral viruses where the capsid proteins assemble into a pseudo-hexameric capsomer organized into tri- and pentasymmetrons  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
due to an erroneous gene model prediction, the coding sequence for l <dig> was wrongly assigned and was until now only partially described  <cit> . the full length coding gene appeared to be composed of three exons separated by two untranscribed introns. this leads to the synthesis of a full length 593aa protein translated from a spliced rna. this feature seems to be unique to apm since the pbcv <dig> a383r or the asfv b646l capsid coding genes do not contain intron sequence  <cit> . tentative bioinformatics analyses of the apm l <dig> gene introns provided poor informations about their sequences. intron  <dig>  matched with an evalue of 1e- <dig> to group i introns while being not related to a specific subgroup  <cit> . intron  <dig>  did not show significant match with either group i or group ii introns  <cit> . until now, the only other described introns in apm genome are self-splicing introns present in the coding sequences of the two largest rna polymerase subunits coding genes l <dig> and r <dig>  <cit> .

rabbit or mouse immune sera produced against purified apm particles were unable to recognize the capsid protein as an antigen in intact viruses, most probably due to the presence of a dense layer of fibrils surrounding the capsid shell. the availability of a monoclonal antibody against capsid protein  <dig> might be useful for the development of detection assays in clinical samples since apm might represent a novel human pathogen  <cit> .

apm capsid protein  <dig> is a glycosylated protein. however its sequence contained no signal peptide, which makes the potential glycosylation sites unlikely to be exposed to the cellular glycosylation machinery. post-translation modifications might occur in the virus factory since viral proteins appeared to be synthesised herein  <cit> . it might be thought that apm possibly use alternative pathways for translation and post-translational modifications. metabolic studies on apm infected amoebae will contribute to understanding the complex interactions between host and pathogen. the recombinant full length capsid protein might also represent a helpful tool to determine the structural organisation of apm viral capsid.

annotation of apm genome revealed  <dig> putative orfs of length =  <dig> amino acid residues. 911orfs were predicted to be protein coding genes and  <dig> of them had functional attributes  <cit> . description of the full length capsid coding gene and characterisation of the corresponding protein demonstrated that structural and functional studies will contribute to improve our knowledge of gene composition and expression of such a complex genome.
