BACKGROUND
natural killer  cells are the crucial mediators of immune reponse against tumor cells and pathogens via modulating both innate and adaptive immune response  <cit> . they can either directly kill the tumor derived or virus infected cells, enhance the phagocytic or bactericidal activity of phagocytes or direct adaptive t cell response towards the th <dig> pattern  <cit> . nk cells constitute around 10% of peripheral blood lymphocytes and are characterized phenotypically by surface expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig> but not cd <dig>  the majority of nk cells  are cd56dimcd16bright – and mediate cytolytic activity against tumor or pathogen-infected cells whereas the remaining  are cytokine producing nk cells with a cd56brightcd16dim/negativephenotype <cit> . these nk subsets also express distinct chemokines that are important in their preferential localization within the lymphatic system  <cit> .

the killing of target cells by nk cells is based on two alternative pathways, namely the perforin/granzyme secretory pathway and the death receptor pathway  <cit> . the secretory pathway can lyse target cells via spontaneous or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity . spontaneous cytotoxicity is initiated by ligand binding to activating nk receptors resulting in sequential recruitment and activation of src and syk kinases, pi3k, rac <dig>  pak <dig>  mek and erk, leading to perforin  <dig> and granzyme b granule polarization and movement toward the ligated target cell  <cit> . adcc killing involves the low affinity receptor for igg on nk cells, cd <dig> . the interaction of cd <dig> with igg coating the target cells leads to signaling through fcεriγ and cd3ζ resulting in cytotoxic granule polarization and possible activation of vav, pi3k and plc-γ <dig>  <cit> . the death receptor pathway is based on the interaction between nk surface-bound ligands such as tnfsf <dig>  and trail or nk-secreted factors such as tnfα, lta and ltb  <cit>  with death receptors on the target cells thereby triggering a signaling cascade resulting in apoptosis of the targeted cells.

the cytokine producing nk cells are important in early innate immune response, where the release of cytokines and chemokines stimulates and recruits other cells. response of the nk cells themselves is under the control of signaling events primed by activating and inhibiting surface receptors. these include different members of the human killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors , the c-type lectin receptor families , cd159a , cd159c , nkg2e , cd <dig> , clec5c  and nkg2d ) and the natural cytotoxicity receptors   <cit> . immune response of nk cells is also under the influence of cytokines such as ifnα, ifnβ, il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig> and il <dig> secreted by other cells of the immune system. il <dig> is a pluripotent cytokine that can expand and activate nk cells  <cit>  as well as promote their migration within target tissues  <cit> , their cytotoxicity  <cit>  and increase the secretion of cytokines, chemokines and other small molecules  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms underlying this classical nk cell activator for increased nk cell activity have not been elucidated.

we performed gene expression profiling on resting and in vitro il <dig> activated human nk cells to increase our understanding of the molecular events important in nk cell activation. increased knowledge of the mechanisms controlling chemokine and cytokine expression, cellular migration and il <dig> mediated signal transduction pathways may help to enhance, re-direct or modify the immune and anti-tumor activity of nk cells and provide a valuable platform for the study of nk cell derived malignancies. we discuss the induction of novel signal transduction pathways during the nk cell activation and validate some of the differentially expressed genes by rt-pcr. the impact of the observed transcriptional profile in orchestrating the innate immune responeby nk cell is also discussed.

RESULTS
general approach on time-dependent gene expression analysis of nk cells stimulated with il2
the aim of the study was to investigate the activation of human nk cells by il <dig> through analyzing the global gene expression at different time points  after culture with the cytokine il <dig> at  <dig> iu/ml. nk cells with the cd56+/cd16+ and cd3- phenotype were negatively selected by immunomagnetic beads and re-examined by flow-cytometry to ensure greater than 90% purity . equivalent amount of total rna from nk cells derived from  <dig> or  <dig> different donors for each time point was pooled, amplified and labeled before duplicate hybridizations was performed on spotted  microarrays . to validate the gene expression data, a different set of experiments with  <dig> other individual donors was performed. rna was similarly extracted and pooled from  <dig> different donors, amplified and labled according to the manufacturer's instruction . the expression data generated from microarray experiments were uploaded in brb-arraytool <cit>  to obtain the functional annotations of the geneid or probe sets and their normalized data were used for further analysis. of the  <dig>  probe sets represented on genechipu133plus2® with  <dig>  unique genes,  <dig> %  of the genes were also represented on the spotted microarray. only pathways showing a similar pattern of expression on the two platforms were selected for further analysis and a few of the genes were also validated by rt-pcr .

resting nk cell signature
the resting nk cell signature from the spotted microarray was defined as differentially expressed genes, that had ≥  <dig> fold higher expressions in resting nk cells compared to the lymphoid rna standard and also ≥  <dig> fold higher expression than tonsillar cells and resting cd8+ t cells. thus,  <dig> transcripts were included in the resting nk cell signature on the spotted array platform . the nk cell signature derived from the genechipu133plus 2® was based on similar comparisons, with the modification that, tonsil profile was replaced with an universal rna standard . in this format,  <dig> unique transcripts were overexpressed in resting nk cells . comparison of the nk cell signatures from the two platforms resulted in a common set of  <dig> genes . the genes included inhibitory nk cell surface molecules, activating nk cell surface molecules as well as cytotoxic mediators. many genes encoding chemokines, cytokines and their receptors and genes involved in secretory functions were also expressed at high levels in resting cells. we also examined a curated resting nk signature from the literature   <cit>  derived from the affymetrix platform  <cit> . thirty-three of sixty genes  were found in our affymetrix derived signature, , demonstrating consistency within the individual platform.

resting nk signature of genes showing  <dig> fold higher expression levels on two microarray platforms. a common set of  <dig> genes were more than  <dig> fold higher expressed in resting nk cells compared to 1) the lymphoid rna standard, tonsillar cells and resting cd8+ t cells on spotted microarrays and 2) the lymphoid rna standard, universal rna standard  and resting cd8+ t cells on genechipu133plus 2® .

temporal analysis of the il <dig> stimulated nk cells
self organizing maps  generated from spotted microarray data identified the differentially expressed genes that had at least a 2-fold alteration in expression level between the time points analyzed . the expression of the selected pathways was examined and cross-validated on both platforms. additional genes on affymetrix microarray platform  belonging to functional groups that were determined to be differentially expressed were included for more comprehensive interpretation.

cytolytic pathway
the mrna of a number of molecules associated with cytolytic function were expressed in resting nk cells , cathepsin o , -k , -s  and -z ), but they were rapidly downregulated upon stimulation with il <dig>  a rapid induction of other molecules involved in granule mediated cytotoxicity were detected concurrently , granulysin , perforin  <dig>  cathepsin d , cathepsin c  and tia1). late activation was observed for granzyme a , -m , -h , cathepsin w , -b  and -f  ).

many members of the tnfsf and tnfrsf were upregulated early. some affecting the death receptor apoptotic pathway  and tnfsf <dig> ) and others probably activating the nf-κb pathway , tnfrsf <dig>  tnfrsf <dig>  tnfα  and tradd ). of interest was tnfsrf <dig>  which can interact with several members of trafs to activate innate immune response in concordance with increased expression of several members of the traf family . in addition, a group of of dipeptidylpeptidases  ), most of which are serine proteases involved in cleaving proline adjacent bonds, showed increased expression mainly at 8– <dig> hours. the well characterized dpps implicated in cytolysis are dpp <dig> , involved in processing of gzma, -b and dpp <dig> , a serine protease involved in cd <dig> mediated cytolysis by nk cells  <cit> .

cytokines, chemokines and their receptors
a few chemokine ligands and receptors showed high expression in resting cells   likely related to the immediate immune response of nk cells. a group of chemokine receptors  and cx3cr1) showed an early increased expression after il <dig> stimulation. later a large number of chemokines and a few chemokine receptors , ccr <dig>  ccr <dig> and cxcr6) showed increased expression at 8– <dig> hours . the increased expression of these genes is likely responsible for the proinflammatory response of nk cells, including the recruitment of nk cells as well as other immune cells to sites of inflammation. many interferons and interferon induced genes were upregulated , ifnγ inducible protein  <dig>  ifn regulatory factor  <dig> , - <dig>  - <dig>  ifna <dig>  - <dig>  ifnar <dig>  - <dig>  ifn induced protein  <dig> , - <dig>  - <dig>  ifn induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats  <dig> , ifit <dig> and ifit5) . some of the interleukins  and interleukin receptors  were highly expressed in resting cells and decreased upon il <dig> stimulation. others were upregulated on il <dig> stimulation , il2rα, il2rβ, il18r <dig>  il17rb, il12rb <dig>  il17r, il2rg, il <dig>  il32/nk <dig>  il <dig>  il27ra, il15ra and il18rap) . this profile of il and ilr expression suggests that resting nk cells are ready for immediate immune response by secreting a number of cytokines. after activation, many ilrs were expressed, indicating that activated nk cells show enhanced sensitivity to autocrine and/or paracrine stimulation by other cells recruited to the site of inflammation.

secretory signature
the transport of nascent polypepetides synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum  to the golgi apparatus is an important step in the secretion of mature proteins through exocytosis. proper folding and appropriate modifications are also crucial steps in protein secretion. the gene profiles showed upregulation of large groups of genes involved in secretory functions. many genes involved in modifications or modulations of proteins affecting their stability and activity were upregulated early   and later  ). a large group of genes involved in vesicle trafficking in the er , post processing in er for optimal enzyme activity  and cargo import to golgi apparatus  were upregulated . in the late phase of activation , genes required for protein transport to specific destinations , proper protein folding , modification  and receptor mediated processing  were overexpressed.

cell surface/adhesion molecules
on il <dig> stimulation, activating nk cell receptors or co-receptors , nkp <dig> , nkp <dig> , cd <dig> , klrb <dig>  klrc <dig> and klrc1) showed increased expression and nk inhibitory receptors  showed decreased expression . however, it was not a universal shift towards an upregulation of activating receptors as some of the activating nk receptors , cd <dig> , klrc <dig> and klrf1) had dimished expression in activated cells. there was also increased expression of some inhibitory receptors , kir2dl <dig> and klrg1). a number of transcripts , cd <dig> , cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd47) were upregulated at 2– <dig> hours. the expression of these genes is generally related to lymphocyte activation or lymphocyte trafficking and cell adhesion. many integrins  and other adhesion molecules  and cd81) had high expression in resting cells which are likely important for nk cell homing. the late induced  surface molecules included cd <dig> , cd <dig> , integrin alpha l  and integrin-β <dig> , that are all important for adhesive interaction of nk cells during immune responses.

cell cycle and proliferation
in freshly isolated nk cells, there was high expression of a group of genes that had cell cyle regulating functions . thus, there was high expression of inhibitory interaction partners of cdks  that prevents the activation of cyclin e-cdk <dig> or cyclin d-cdk <dig> complexes, cdkn2d  inhibitor of cdk <dig> and cdk5rap <dig>  inhibitor of cdk5). other negative cell cycle regulators ) had increased expression suggesting a tight control of cell cycle progression in the resting circulating nk cells of peripheral blood. a few activators were also present  activator of cdk <dig>  cdk <dig> that together with ccnh  and mat <dig> functions as a cdk-activating kinase  and ccnc that interacts with cdk8) . in keeping with the postulate, these inhibitory genes showed rapid downregulation upon il <dig> activation. concomitantly, there was an early  increase in expression of genes involved in regulating general transcription, initiation/regulation of dna replication, dna repair and translation control ). numerous genes involved in the g1/s phase of the cell cycle  and bccip; activators cdc <dig>  - <dig> and -6), members of cell cycle transcriptional regulators ), and associated proteins  and many cyclins  showed an increased expression at 8– <dig> hours. a family of genes crucial for dna replication in the s-phase ) showed maximum expression at  <dig> hours. most of the m phase and anaphase regulators were not upregulated. interestingly, a few genes involved in the late phases of of cell cycle: anaphase promoting control  and kintechore associated gene  were highly expressed by  <dig> hours, suggesting that they may serve some different functions at earlier phases of the cell cycle. the proliferation marker pcna showed high expression by  <dig> hours ).

signal transduction
jak/stat pathway
cytokine signals mediating control of cell growth and survival often involve the jak/stat pathway. thus, addition of il <dig> to resting nk cells in culture induced upregulation of an important upstream member of this pathway  and major substrates  and trancriptional mediators of stats ). several negative regulators of the jak/stat pathway: supressors of cytokine signaling  were downregulated after  <dig> hours with il <dig> stimulation, whereas others  were upregulated. activation of jak <dig> and jak <dig> in response to il <dig> in nk cells has been reported previously and implicated in the activation of stat <dig> and stat <dig>  respectively  <cit> . these observations are in agreement with our findings that  <dig> of  <dig> stat <dig> target genes  examined and  <dig> of  <dig> stat <dig> targets ) showed increased expression in il <dig> stimulated cell. examination of the targets of stat <dig> showed an increase in  <dig> of  <dig> target genes. the transcript levels of jak <dig>  stat <dig> and stat <dig> did not show a consistent pattern on the two platforms and they were not analyzed further.

tgfβ pathway
transforming growth factor-β  pathway regulates diverse cellular function through smad proteins, which regulate transcription through their interaction with other transcription factors and the recruitment of co-repressors or co-activators depending on the cellular and functional context. three members of tgfb <dig> type ii receptors , bmpr <dig>  and acvr2a), several ligands ) and many members of the smad family , co-smad  and i-smad ) were upregulated in resting nk cells . we also observed increased expression of smad <dig> interacting coactivators  and marginal decrease in co-repressor tgif expression in resting cells. smad ligases  and associated proteins  showed increased expression in resting cells. the elaboration of tgfb <dig> protein by resting nk cells has been well documented and the downregulation of tgfβ pathway in nkcells activated by proinflamatory cytokines  has also been observed by others  <cit> . we also observed a change in the expression profile of transcripts on this pathway on il <dig> activation with downregulation of many of the transcripts mentioned above and upregulation of receptors  and the r-smad  in activated nk cells. smad <dig> showed brief marginal repression upon il <dig> activation , but upregulation in late activated cells . some negative regulators also seemed to be active in resting cells but examination of the target genes of tgfβ/smads showed high expression in  <dig> out of  <dig> genes. thus, it appears that resting nk cells have an active tgfb <dig> signaling pathway involving at least smad <dig> and smad <dig> instead of smad <dig>  features that are similar to signaling mediated by other members of the tgfβ superfamily, namely the bmps  <cit> . an active tgfβ pathway may be important in maintaining growth arrest through inhibition of granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factors   <cit>  or induction of p <dig> and p <dig>  in addition to the negative modulation of pro-inflammatory and cytolytic activites  <cit> .

pi3k- pathway activation
upon il <dig> stimulation of nk cells, signal transduction from tyrosine phosphorylation of the il2rβ chain results in activation of the pi3k signaling pathway  <cit> . three genes encoding pi3k catalytic subunits had highest expression levels after  <dig> hours , while the transcript encoding the β-subunit showed a slower rise . this increased pi3k expression occurred even though the negative regulator of the pathway, the phosphatase pten  <cit>  showed progressively increased expression in the stimulated cell ). pi3k activation enhances cell survival and antagonizes apoptosis via akt of which subtypes  became upregulated by il <dig>  activated akt inhibits apoptosis by phosphorylating bad that is part of the bad/bclxl complex. phosphorylated bad dissociate from the bad/bclxl complex, thereby promoting cell survival. this correlates well with downregulated akt target genes that are crucial for cell cycle regulation e.g. the foxo genes  responsible for promoting quiescence  <cit>  and p <dig>  a cell cycle inhibitor. in addition, akt activates eif4e, a promoter of protein synthesis through mtor and eif4e had increased expression in activated cells. pi3k can also regulate cytotoxicity by activation of the rac <dig>  pak <dig>  mek1/ <dig>  and erk1/ <dig>  pathways  <cit> . the expression of all these genes was upregulated in activated cells. since akt1and - <dig>  rac <dig>  pak <dig>  mek1/ <dig>  and erk1/ <dig>  were upregulated and foxo3a, -1a and p <dig> were downregulated in our study, it is likely that pi3k influences several pathways simultaneously affecting cell survival, cell cycling and cytotoxicity.

nfat activation in nk cells
the activation of nfat is regulated by ca2+ /calcineurin dependent signaling and has been implicated in the secretion of various cytokines upon cd <dig> ligand binding in nk cells  <cit> . the transcriptional activity of nfat can be activating or inhibitory, depending on the co-factors, including ap <dig>  mef <dig>  gata and histone deacetylases . among the five members of the nfat family, only nfat <dig> showed upregulation at the early phase of il <dig> stimulation in both platforms , similar to the report by jin et.al . in t cells, nfat activation is mediated through the cd3ζ and cd3γ of the tcr and regulated by the phosphatase calcineurin. calcineurin can dephosphorylate nfat  proteins, leading to their nuclear import and dna binding. the increased expression of cd3ζ, positive regulators of intracellular ca2+ release , catalytic calcineurin a subunits ,β  and γ ) and kinases for nfat nuclear shuttling  and jnk) in activated nk cells suggested the induction of nfat signaling on il <dig> stimulation. concordant with the above changes, we observed downregulation of crucial inhibitors ) of this pathway in activated cells. several target genes were upregulated at different time points , e.g. fasl, il2rb, cx3cr <dig>  and tgfb <dig> at  <dig> hours and ifnγ, p <dig>  and tnf <dig> at  <dig> hours. a recent study showed that il <dig> can induce cx3cr <dig> expression through nfat <dig>  binding to its promoter, whereas il <dig> represses it through induction of nfat <dig>  <cit> . this observation indicates that nfat <dig>  and nfat <dig>  may have opposite roles in the expression of some genes in nk cells. nfatc <dig>  interacts with gata <dig>  <cit> , the major t-cell transcriptional regulator, that was highly expressed in resting nk cells as in naïve t cells and was downregulated on il <dig> stimulation. t-bet  on the other hand showed increased expression with il <dig> stimulation. gata <dig> is a th2-regulating transcription factors that promotes the expression of il <dig> and il <dig>  while t-bet is a th1-specific transcription factor that controls the expression of ccr <dig>  ifng and il18r <dig>  all of which increased in activated nk-cells. these transcription factors may have similar roles in nk cells. t-bet is also required for terminal maturation and peripheral homeostasis of nk cells  <cit> .

nf-κb pathway regulation
resting cells have high expression of the nf-κb family genes , relb and nf-κb <dig> ), some members of toll-like receptor  and il1r pathway ). upon activation, maintained or increased expression of these transcripts was seen and many additional transcripts of different nf-κb activating signaling pathways were upregulated. thus, in the tlr/il1r pathway increased expression was observed for tlr <dig> and adaptor proteins , adaptor kinases , kinase interacting protein  and the kinases tak <dig> and tab <dig> that activate the ikk complex. members of the tnf receptor super family  and tnfrsf <dig> ), their adaptors protein  and associated protein  also showed upregulation in activated cells suggesting tnf receptor mediated nf-κb activation since traf <dig> can recruit the iΦb kinases  to the tnf receptor complex, where rip can activate the ikk catalytic subunits  through map3kinases ). furthermore, some of the positive regulators of the nf-κb signaling cascade in t cells through tcr signaling were also observed to be upregulated during both the early and late phase of il <dig> stimulation. these included the kinases  involved in the activation of carma <dig>  that leads to the phosphorylation of bcl <dig>  whereas the other essential component in t and b-cell antigen receptor mediated activation of nf-κb  <cit> , malt <dig> decreased. since the expression of bcl <dig> varied between the two platforms the upregulation of bcl <dig> was confirmed by rt-pcr .

this upregulation of many genes in three different upstream pathways suggested multiple signals converged in the activation of the nf-κb pathway, perhaps exerting different influence at different time points. the downstream components of the pathway, which include nf-κb transcripts , nf-κb <dig>  and relb) were also increased at  <dig> hours. nf-κb activity is negatively regulated by the binding of inhibitory proteins  of which nf-κbia and -z  showed decreased expression in activated cells, however nf-κbia showed increased expression at  <dig> hours which correlated with the fact that nf-κb induces iκbα expression  <cit>  . phosphorylation of the iκb proteins by the serine-kinase complex  iκbkβ, iκbkγ and iκbkε) marks them for destruction, thereby allowing the nuclear localization of the nf-κb dimers. of these kinases iκbkβ and iκbkε showed marked increased expression whereas iκbkα  and iκbkγ showed decreased expression in activated cells. activation of nf-κb is supported by the expression of many target genes in il <dig> stimulated cells at one or more time points ii). interestingly, some of these genes showed high expression in freshly isolated cells. it is possible that the pathway was partially activated in resting cells, but it is also possible that some of the genes might be activated through the manipulation involved in the isolation of the nk cells. the expression of some nf-κb target genes e.g icam- <dig>  iκba, ccr <dig> and fasl was confirmed by rt-pcr .

discussion
a gene expression signature of resting nk cells from the peripheral blood of healthy donors and the changes in transcriptional profiles upon il <dig> activation were obtained to overview the functional pathways underlying the biological properties of these cells. others have addressed il <dig> activation of nk cells for fixed time points of  <dig> hours  <cit>  or  <dig> days with multiple activating stimuli with il <dig>  pha and feeder cells  <cit>  whereas our study is directed at early temporal regulation of pure nk cell activation. our time course experiments demonstrated that il <dig> exerts a broad range of effects on nk cells ranging from regulation of cell cycle, cell survival, cytotoxicity and secretion of immunologic and inflammatory effectors in a sequential manner. the use of two microarray platforms and independent nk cell populations validated the generated expression patterns and the biological properties that they suggested. observed discrepancies between the two platforms indicate that technical variables and platform specific factors influence the large scale transcriptional profiles and sounds cautionary note for efforts to interpret differential gene expression. the technical variables include rna amplifications protocols, which may also influence the gene expression profile  <cit> . we have used very strict criteria in our comparative analysis of the two platforms to attend greater accuracy but this approach may lead to the lost of some information. however, the basic information generated from these platforms correlates well when gene signatures and biological pathways rather than single genes were compared. it is also important to keep in mind that high expression of components of a signaling pathway does not indicate activation of that pathway which may involve phosphorylation, specific intracellular localization or other posttranslational determinants. on the other hand, when group of genes subserving specific functional activities show altered expression patterns, it is indicative perturbation of the pathway in response to a given stimulus.

resting nk cells are characterized by a set of genes that maintain the cells at quiescent state as exemplified by the expression of foxo3a, sla, klf <dig> , pnrc <dig> and btg <dig> . an interesting finding is the high expression of many smads suggesting an active tgfβ pathway that may be part of the mechanism maintaining the resting profile and controlling the effector function of the nk cells. that these transcripts are involved in maintaining nk cells in the quiescent state is also supported by their rapid downregulation on il- <dig> stimulation.

high expression of other effector-transcripts like cytotoxic effectors, cytokines and chemokines, nk receptors, unique surface markers and adhesion molecules illustrated the potential of circulating nk cells of the peripheral blood to catalyze and participate in the immediate immune responses. the presence of mrnas encoding ligands like ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  tnfsf <dig>  fasl and ccl <dig> might contribute to the killing of targets, activating other inflammatory cells and maintaining the circulating nk population in this reactive-prepared condition by autocrine stimulation loops. thus, the ccr <dig> ligands ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> that are expressed in the resting nk cells may act directly on the growth and survival of neighboring nk cells expressing ccr <dig> at the initiation phase of an innate immune response. such an autocrine loop is observed for ccl5-ccr <dig> in prostate cancer  <cit> . the effector expression profiles shift when the cells are stimulated and more receptor transcripts are expressed preparing the circulating nk cells to take on other functional roles and adapt to increased paracrine stimulation from other infiltrating immune cells.

another interesting observation is the high expression of gata <dig> in resting nk cells, similar to observation in resting t cells  <cit> . t-bet, on the other hand, had low expression in resting nk cells. there is evidence that both gata <dig> and t-bet are important in the development of nk cells  <cit>  but they may also be important in the function of mature nk cells. gata <dig> is downregulated in th <dig> cells, but its expression is maintained in th <dig> cells. this raised the intriguing possibility that downregulation of gata <dig> and upregulation of t-bet  in il <dig> stimulated nk cells is required for the elaboration of th <dig> type of cytokines in activated nk cells. together with the decreased expression of gata <dig>  activated nk cells appear to change to a more th1-like expression profile. while il <dig> is a well known th <dig> activator, a similar role has not previously been reported or observed for nk cells. the regulation of the transcriptional profiles of pro and anti inflammatory cytokines and chemokines through these transcription factors is an interesting area of future investigation.

stimulation of resting nk cells with il <dig> triggered an expression pattern consistent with the nk cells as important mediators of pro-inflammatory and innate immune response. hence, the pro-inflammatory cytokines like ifnγ, ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  lta and ccl <dig> were upregulated whereas anti-inflammatory cytokines and receptors like il18bp and tnfrsf1b  <cit>  were downregulated. combined with the activated innate immune response mediated by increased tlr signaling  and tab <dig> and the enhanced direct ) and indirect erk enhanced ) nk cell cytotoxicity  <cit>  the stimulation of the circulating nk cells resulted in a significant shift in transcript profile reflecting the cells adapting to new functional roles. strikingly, the cytolytic profile exhibited by activated nk cells resemble closely that of il <dig> activated cd8+ t-cells  <cit> . in cd8+ t-cells, the cytotoxic effectors in granules  and tnf family members  were induced whereas gzmk and cd <dig>  were downregulated after  <dig> hours of stimulation  . in our study, the above mentioned genes were also upregulated but cd <dig> showed upregulation at  <dig> hours.

il <dig> stimulation mediated early activation of the jak/stat signaling pathway  hence affecting down stream transcription of many target genes . when we examined stat target gene expression, many targets of stat <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> are upregulated providing confirmatory evidence of stat <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> activation. upregulation of jak <dig>  stat- <dig>   <dig>  and 5a was also observed by jin and colleagues with purified cd8+ and cd4+ t cells stimulated with il <dig>  <cit> , indicating a common usuage of the jak/stat pathway in the activation in these cells, at least initially . in our study the inhibitors of jak/stat signaling  were downregulated but pias <dig>  - <dig> and socs <dig> were upregulated illustrating a balance that may limit the degree of jak/stat activation. il <dig> can also activate the ras-->raf-->mek-->erk signaling pathway via jak phosphorylation of shc leading to stimulation of proliferation in t cells  <cit> . this may happened in nk cells and this is suggested by our study by the observed upregulated mek <dig>  and erk <dig> .

powerful pro-survival signals were induced by il2
four different genes of the pi3k family were upregulated as were the three isoforms of akt kinases and simultaneously there was decreased expression of the akt target genes . together with the facts that activated akt promotes cell survival through 1) phosphorylation dependent dissociation of the bad/bclxl complex  <cit>   and 2) activation of nf-κb through phosphorylation of ikk-β  <cit>   il <dig> induced pi3k resulted in the expression patterns of transcripts that appear to promote survival and proliferation. interestingly, when ctls were simulated in the presence of other cells in pbmc, the upregulation of both pi3k and akt were not detected <cit>  even though il <dig> induced a general t cell activation and anti-apoptotic effect illustrating the importance of interactions between effector and bystander cells. our study was focused on purified nk cells and the effects of bystander cells will not be observed.

nf-κb activation could be mediated by pathways other than il <dig> induced pi3k activation, namely the tlr/il1r pathway, the tnf pathway and possibly a nk specific surface receptor pathway involving bcl <dig>  we have observed good evidence of nf-κb activation through the first two pathways. it is well established that in both t and b cells, bcl <dig> specifically mediate antigen receptor-induced nf-κb activation  <cit>  in nk cells, bcl <dig> has been observed in the cytoplasm of normal nk cells, and in the nuclei of tumor cells of nasal nk/t-cell lymphomas  <cit> . since we observed upregulation of bcl <dig>  nf-κb <dig> and nf-κb <dig> upon stimulation of nk cells with il <dig>  it is possible that cytokine receptor mediated signaling also involve bcl <dig>  the expression pattern of card <dig>  a participant in bcl <dig> induced nf-κb activation in t and b cells  <cit>  also supports this idea. in support of nf-κb activation was the upregulation of nf-κb <dig>  nf-κb <dig> and the upregulation nf-κb target genes . in cd8+t cells, jin et.al observed increased expression of several mediators of nf-κb pathway, possibly through modulation of tcr signaling 

activation of nfat signaling pathway
pi3k can promote nfat nuclear accumulation in two ways: by enhancing ca2+ mobilization and calcineurin-dependent nfat dephosphorylation leading to nuclear import, or by akt-mediated inactivation of gsk- <dig> that can phosphorylate nfat and drive nuclear export  <cit> . the increased expression of positive regulators of intracellular ca2+ release, activators of calcineurin, catalytic calcineurin a subunits and kinases for nfat nuclear shuttling in activated nk cells suggested both mechanisms to be involved in the nfat signaling induced by il <dig>  nfatc <dig> showed highest expression in resting nk cells, similar to a prior observation in resting t cells, where it is the predominant nfat protein  <cit> . nfatc <dig> interacts with gata <dig> to maintain the differentiated th <dig> phenotype  <cit> . this supports the notion of suppressed expression of th <dig> type cytokines in resting nk cells. the profile shifted with the downregulation of gata <dig> and upregulation of t-bet on activation.

temporal pattern of transcript expression
the early increase in transcription  is likely regulated directly by signaling events – "first wave" induced transcription. genes that were upregulated only after 8– <dig> hours are likely to represent activation of "second wave" genes and these were numerous in our study and especially represented genes involved in adhesion, secretory pathway, cytotoxicity and cell cycle control. these "second wave" transcripts are probably under the control of upstream genes or induced by factors such as cytokines or chemokines that are elaborated by the cells at a later time point as illustrated by general upregulation of target genes of stat <dig> and nf-κb. many genes had expression patterns where transcript levels were upregulated at  <dig> hours, low at  <dig> hours and then high again at  <dig> hours , cytokine signaling , secretory signaling , cell cycle regulation ). the control of transcription of these genes is more complex and may involve feedback inhibition or the induction of inhibitors. time course experiments are therefore important to gain a more complete picture of the biology and function of the cell of interest.

the effect of il <dig> on cytotoxic cells have been reported by several groups  <cit>  showing many similarities as well as differences. for example, cd8+ t cells stimulated with  <dig> iu/ml of il <dig> for  <dig> hours either alone or cocultured with pbmc upregulate il <dig>  il <dig>  tnfα and ifnγ whereas the nk cells in our study did not express il <dig> or il <dig>  and the upregulation of tnfα and ifnγ was registered at  <dig> hours. the cytokine profile of activated nk cells showed marked differences with that observed in activated cd8+t cells by jin et.al <cit> , with the exception of a few genes . a few chemokines e.g.ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> were only observed to be upregulated at  <dig> hours in activated nk cells, whereas in cd8+ t cells, these chemokines are upregulated early . on the other hand ccl <dig>  il <dig> and cxcr <dig> were downregulated in isolated cd8+ t cells, but upregulated in nk cells. in general, a detailed comparison is very difficult because of the different systems used and the different time point at which the assays were performed. the expression of many of the genes are highly variable over a  <dig> hr period so there is a significant degree of uncertainty when compared with results from a particular time point.

in most of the studies, the ethnic composition of the subjects studied was not specified but a systematic comparison of two ethnic groups was performed by jin and co-workers  <cit> . the latter study is important in highlighting racial differences in immune response and may provide insight into the differences in disease susceptibility and response to immune modulation.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our study demonstrated gene expression profiles associated with il <dig> induced increased cytotoxicity, changes in chemokines, cytokines and adhesion properties, enhanced pro-inflammatory and innate immune response and changes in signaling pathways in nk cells. the changes in chemotactic signaling and surface/adhesion profile may enable the il <dig> activated nk cells to migrate and infiltrate tissues where inflammation occur and upon arrival recruit other effector cells of the immune system. at the same time, nk cells may be more responsive and involved in both autocrine and paracrine signaling in the local environment than previously recognized. there is good evidence indicating nf-κb activation which may play a central role in pro-survival and pro-inflammatory function in activated nk cells. the role tgfβ in maintaining cell quiescence, gata3/t-bet as master regulators of transcription of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and bcl <dig> in nf-κb activation are intriguing and merit further investigation. nfat signaling pathway also appears to have a functional role in il <dig> stimulated nk cells. future investigations including the interactions with other immune cells would provide a more complete picture of the possible changes of gep on activation in various in vivo situations. comparison of different ethnic groups especially with snp data will allow better understanding of normal and disordered immune response.
