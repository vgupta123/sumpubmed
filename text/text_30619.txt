BACKGROUND
brucellosis is the most common bacterial zoonosis caused by members of the brucella genus, which infect a wide range of mammals, including dogs, ruminants, humans, and marine mammals. within the last few years, brucellosis has re-emerged, presenting severe public health challenges and major economic burdens globally  <cit> . the measures to eradicate and control brucellosis outbreaks are principally based on an intensive test-and-slaughter policy  <cit> , in which effective technology to diagnose brucellosis plays an important role. although bacterial isolation and identification of brucella spp. is defined as the ‘gold standard’ for diagnosis of brucellosis, serological tests are routinely used in brucellosis control and eradication programs. currently, the common serological diagnosis methods for bovine brucellosis include the serum agglutination test , the rose-bengal plate agglutination test , the milk ring test   <cit> , the complement fixation test   <cit> , and primary binding assays such as the indirect elisa   <cit> , the competitive elisa   <cit> , and the fluorescence polarization assay   <cit> . the majority of serological tests mentioned rely on the detection of antibodies against lipopolysaccharide . however, false positive results often occur from cross-reaction in the serological detection  <cit> , due to common antigens on lps of brucella and certain bacteria, especially yersinia enterocolitica o: <dig> and escherichia coli o <dig>  <cit> . the sensitivity and specificity of different serological tests are variant  <cit> . agglutination tests often do not have very good specificity. the cft with high specificity and sensitivity has been approved, but tedious operations make it difficult to use for large-scale detection. in the past few decades, the fpa and ielisa with high sensitivity have been used for the diagnosis of brucellosis. the ielisa methods based on lps antigens easily produce cross-reaction with the antibodies against other bacterial pathogens, which may result in over-culled animals. unfortunately, the sensitivity of ielisa with protein antigens is not as good as the sensitivity of ielisa utilizing lps  <cit> . the fpa performs excellently for diagnosis but requires expensive specialized apparatus for measurement. these faults indicate that a high-throughput diagnostic methods with good specificity and sensitivity is necessary. the celisa has become a reliable alternate diagnosis for brucellosis. however, of the limited sensitivity and specificity, the various monoclonal antibodies  used in celisa may result in omission or false detection in practical application. therefore, an optimal celisa for the diagnosis of animal brucellosis should be based on the mab with high specificity and satisfactory properties.

lps is a major surface antigen of brucella that can be divided into smooth type  or rough type  depending on the inclusion or lack of o-polysaccharide  moiety. four types of epitopes on the brucella ops have been described: the m and a epitopes, present on m and a dominant brucella strains, respectively; the common  epitope, strictly specific for smooth brucella spp., either a or m dominant; and the c/y epitope, which is common to smooth brucella spp. and y. enterocolitica o: <dig>  <cit> . different ops epitopes are probably overlapping structures, but the c epitopes would be important to establish celisa for the diagnosis of brucellosis.

for the serological detection of brucella-infected cattle,  <dig> mabs against smooth brucella lps were produced and characterized. fortunately, among them, one was identified to be against c epitope. this mab was selected to develop a competitive elisa, which was compared with other methods for the detection of brucella infection in cattle. the results showed that the developed celisa demonstrated significantly improved specificity and good sensitivity.

RESULTS
screening and characterization of mab
this study immunized mice with heat-killed b. melitensis 16 m and boosted with large dose of purified lps . after four times of cell fusion, hybridomas screened by the ielisa established, twelve positive clones specific to lps were obtained and then subcloned three times through the use of a limited dilution method. among these mabs, three were igg <dig> , four were igg <dig> , four were igm , and one was igg2a.fig.  <dig> coomassie blue-staining  and silver-staining  of lps extracted from b.melitensis 16 m. lps was prepared by hot phenol-water extraction method and fractionated by sds-page electrophoresis, followed by commassie blue  or silver  staining. lps banding is seen . the absence of band in commassie blue staining as shown in a indicates no contamination of purified lps with bacterial proteins. lane 1: lps, lane 2: molecular weight marker



characterization of specificity and epitope of mab
in this study, the western blot with whole-cell lysates showed that four mabs  were specific to b.melitensis 16 m. meanwhile, the other eight mabs  recognized epitope c/y because they had weak cross-reactivity with y. enterocolitica o: <dig> . the results from the elisa were consistent with the western blot test .fig.  <dig> western blot analysis for specifity of mabs. specificity of mabs was investigated with whole-cell extracts of brucella melitensis 16 m and different pathogens. western blot were carried out as described in materials and methods. abbreviation: ec: e. coli o157; pm: p. multocida; ye: y. enterocolitica o:9; ft: f. tularensis lvs; bm: b. melitensis 16 m; oa: o. anthropic atcc49188; sg: s. gallinarum

c epitopes have been subdivided and seven epitopes on the brucella ops have been defined, including: a, m, c , c , c/y , c/y , and c/y   <cit> . further analysis of the mab epitope specificity was performed with native rough phenotype brucella and with smooth brucella strains of three serotypes, i.e., a+m−, a−m+, and a+m+, corresponding to strains expressing mainly the a  or m  antigen or both antigens in nearly equivalent amounts  <cit>  . all the mabs expect mab 6b <dig>  had no reactivity with rough type b. canis rm 6/ <dig>  mab 2c <dig>  3e <dig>  6e <dig> reacted only with b. melitensis 16 m , which confirmed the specificity for m epitope. mab 3 f <dig> was thought to be specific for the c epitope, as it bound to b. melitensis 16 m, b. abortus  <dig> , and b. melitensis ni .fig.  <dig> western blot analysis for epitope of mabs. whole-cell extracts of b. canis rm6/ <dig> , b. melitensis ni , b. melitensis 16 m , b. abortus  <dig>  were used to analyze the epitopic specificity of mabs. sds-page and western blot were carried out as described in materials and methods




ielisa was performed to measure the mabs relative binding level . mab 3 f <dig> bound equally to b. melitensis 16 m and b. melitensis ni, but had a weaker bind to b. abortus  <dig>  and thus, it recognized c  epitope. aside from binding to y. enterocolitica o: <dig>  the binding level of mabs 4h <dig>  4c <dig>  6b <dig>  6 f <dig>  ii5g <dig>  ii4d <dig> were generally equal relative to a or m dominance. these results confirmed their c/y  specificity. as mab 3h <dig>  i2c <dig> bound to the a-dominant strain significantly stronger than to the m-dominant strain, they were thought to be specific for the c/y  epitope.

determination of cut-off value and specificity of celisa
on account of its specificity for c epitope, mab 3 f <dig> was selected to develop a celisa. after protocol optimization of blocking solution, dilution ratio of mab and sample respectively,  <dig> negative bovine serum samples were used to determine the cut-off value. as the p-value of negative sera pi analyzed with the shapiro-wilk test was  <dig> , this paper concluded that the data were distributed normally. the mean pi value was 22 %  for the bovine. therefore, the cut-off value  to determine the status of the serum samples in response to smooth brucella was set at 40 % .fig.  <dig> establishment of the celisa.  percent inhibition values of  <dig> negative serum samples by celisa. a cut-off value was set at 40 % .  percent inhibition of polyclonal antisera against various bacteria serological related with smooth brucella.  <dig> y. enterocolitica o:9;  <dig> e. coli o157; 3 s. gallinarum;  <dig> o. anthropic atcc49188; 5 f. tularensis lvs;  <dig> p. multocida;  <dig> positive bovine sera. only the positive bovine sera had a pi exceeding the cut-off value. the error bars indicate the standard deviations from three-well replications for each serum sample

six hyperimmune antisera and  <dig> clinical bovine serum samples were tested with the celisa. the resulting data were compared with data obtained from a commercial celisa kit, the rbt and the mat. five of the six hyperimmune antisera were negative in the four diagnostic tests. notably, the antisera of y. enterocolitica o: <dig> detected as negative in the celisa and the mat, but as positive in the commercial kit and the rbt .table  <dig> results of  <dig> hyperimmune antisera detection by celisa, commercial kit, rbt and mat

discussion
domestic animals infected with brucella spp. are culled partly based on the detection of the antibodies against brucella lps antigen. however, other bacterial infections often disturb the serological examination of brucellosis  <cit> , due to the antigens of cross-reaction among the bacteria. it is known that smooth brucella lps contains o-polysaccharide  moiety, which has been divided into seven epitopic specificities: a, m, c , c , c/y , c/y , and c/y   <cit> . research has shown that the cross-reactions in the brucellosis serological detection mainly occur as a result of the similar structures that a and c/y epitopes share with the ops of y. enterocolitica o: <dig> and other bacteria  <cit> . these possible inaccuracies in serological examination methods due to cross-reaction may result in the wrong-culling of animals in the campaigns to eradicate animal brucellosis.

in this study,  <dig> mabs against lps of brucella melitensis 16 m were characterized, among which four were igm mabs, four were igg <dig>  three were igg <dig>  and one was igg2a. brucella strains of three serotypes belonging to brucella melitensis and brucella abortus were used as representations to identify the epitope specificity of mabs. brucella suis, which possess five biovars of three serotypes were not used due to the lack of the strains in the laboratory. as brucella suis biovar  <dig> displayed unique reactivity with mabs of c  and c   <cit> , identification of mabs with brucella suis biovar  <dig> may provide some interesting results. almost all of the mabs were against the c/y or m epitopes, with the exception of mab 3 f <dig>  interestingly, among the six mabs that recognized c/y  epitope, mab 6b <dig> reacted faintly with b. canis rm 6/ <dig> , which led this study to analyze whether there were discrepancies between the epitopes of these mabs. the elisa additivity test  <cit>  was applied to the six mabs, and the results  showed that either two mabs failed to bind simultaneously to the antigen. as the core oligosaccharide is common to rough and smooth lps, mab 6b <dig> likely differed from the others by recognizing this region rather than just the formamido-mannose polymer in ops  <cit> . the epitope of mab 6b <dig> necessitates further analysis.

fortunately, one monoclonal antibody 3 f <dig>  which belonged to the igg <dig> isotype, was identified to be specific for c epitope as evidenced by western blot and ielisa in this study. mab 3 f <dig> indicates good specificity, as it did not cross-react with e. coli o <dig>  s. gallinarum, p. multocida, y. enterocolitica o: <dig>  f. tularensis lvs, or o. anthropic atcc <dig>  furthermore, the mab 3 f <dig> was used to establish a successful celisa for the examination of bovine brucellosis. as cattle is mainly infected by b. abortus, sometimes can also be infected by b.melitensis and by b. suis when they share pastures or facilities with infected pigs, goats and sheep  <cit> , the method in this study would be extensively applicable because brucella c epitopes appear in all smooth brucella spp. besides, this proposed method could eliminate the nonspecific serological reaction in the examination of bovine brucellosis.

the established celisa was compared with rbt, mat and a commercial celisa kit for the detection of six hyperimmune antisera and  <dig> clinical bovine serum samples. the results showed that all of six hyperimmune antisera, including antisera against e. coli o <dig> and y. enterocolitica o: <dig> that commonly cross-reacted in brucellosis serological diagnosis, presented negative responses in the celisa test. however, the hyperimmune antisera against y. enterocolitica o: <dig> tested positive in the commercial kit and rbt. mat test determined its antibody titer to be  <dig>  the results demonstrate that the celisa established in this study possesses higher specificity than the commercial celisa and rbt. multiple serum samples from animals infected with these pathogens may be more suitable for evaluation of the specificity. however, in consideration of the hyperimmune antisera used in this test with higher titer and affinity than clinical sera, it’s persuasive for the good specificity of the celisa.

the results of  <dig> clinical bovine sarum samples by the celisa coincided with the results of the commercial kit and rbt at rates of 90 % , and  <dig>  % , respectively. all the samples appearing negative in rbt test also tested negative in the improved celisa. moreover, the samples that had antibody titers over  <dig> in mat test also had a positive response in the celisa, the commercial kit, and rbt tests. these results shown in detail in an additional table  suggest that the celisa has a good detection performance. of samples positive in rbt test and of the antibody titers 50– <dig> in mat test, 100 %  samples tested positive in the celisa test, and only  <dig>  %  tested positive in the commercial celisa test. these results indicate that the celisa may have better sensitivity in the detection of serological positive state with low antibody titer. a further accurate comparison may need more serum samples in status of low antibody titer. these comparative results also showed that rbt was the most sensitive and suitable for screening test in bovine brucellosis.

although this preliminary results indicated the applicable prospects of the celisa for the specific detection of bovine brucellosis, further evaluating and optimizing the detection performance of this method was indispensable in the future with the standardized positive and negative sera, and more clinical bovine serum samples. it was reported that celisa could be used to distinguish vaccinated antibody  <cit> . in this study the ability of differentiating cattle vaccinated with s <dig> from infected with brucella field strains was also required for evaluation of the detection performance of the celisa. some brucella-infected animals reacted negatively to serological tests  <cit> , which indicated an early-stage infection or the bacterial loads were too few. more research should be conducted on these cases.

CONCLUSIONS
this study prepared twelve monoclonal antibodies against smooth brucella lipopolysaccharides through cell fusions and then characterized them by western blot and ielisa. one monoclonal antibody 3 f <dig> presented the igg <dig> subclass, c epitope specificity. mab 3 f <dig> was used to establish a celisa for the detection of bovine brucellosis. a comparison of the celisa with a commercial celisa kit, rbt and mat showed that, the celisa had more specificity than the commercial celisa kit and rbt, and comparable sensitivity with the commercial celisa kit. this study provided a valuable detection tool with higher specificity and good sensitivity, which prevent the wrong-culling of bovines in the eradication campaigns of bovine brucellosis.
