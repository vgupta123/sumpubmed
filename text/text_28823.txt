BACKGROUND
the use of porcine cells, tissues, and organs for transplantation or extracorporeal perfusion would greatly benefit the  <dig>  patients on the united network for organ sharing transplant waiting list, as well as those considered medically unsuitable for transplantation of scarce human organs or tissues  <cit> . unfortunately, humans and old world primates vigorously reject pig tissues due to xenoantibodies that react with the polysaccharide galactose α  galactose  present on the surface of many porcine cells. this rejection is the result of two processes, involving both preformed, circulating xenoantibodies, and those antibodies whose production is stimulated by the presence of the xenograft  <cit> . despite this immunological barrier, porcine cells and tissues have been used clinically: pig heart valves have been utilized since  <dig>  <cit> , and islets have been transplanted into at least ten diabetic patients  <cit> . numerous patients have also undergone extracorporeal perfusion using porcine livers to reduce circulating toxins  <cit> , and new perfusion systems are continually being developed  <cit> . bioartificial liver devices , containing porcine hepatocytes in a filter cartridge with a semi-permeable membrane, were first used in emergency situations, and have now entered clinical trials  <cit> . these bals are primarily designed for treatment of acute liver failure as a "bridge" while awaiting a human liver graft for allotransplantation, or until the damaged liver recovers from injury  <cit> .

we previously examined the xenoantibody response in patients exposed to porcine hepatocytes via treatment with bals  <cit> . we determined that xenoantibodies in bal patients are predominantly directed at porcine αgal carbohydrate epitopes, and are encoded by a small number of germline heavy chain variable region  immunoglobulin genes  <cit> .

in an effort to define the nature of the immune response to individual hepatocytes and vascularized organ grafts in a pre-clinical lower primate model, we studied the xenoantibody response of rhesus monkeys  to pig hepatocytes as isolated cells and as solid organ xenografts. this series of experiments allowed us to confirm that:  <cit>  the immunoglobulin xenoantibody responses of non-immunosuppressed primates exposed to porcine hepatocytes were similar, if not identical, to the response elicited by a vascularized hepatic graft, and  <cit>  both responses were encoded by alleles of the same germline progenitors as those utilized in humans exposed to pig hepatocytes via a bal device. this new information suggests that the xenograft response in rhesus monkeys provides an appropriate model for the development of therapies for clinical application.

RESULTS
monkeys exposed to porcine hepatocytes show sustained and elevated xenoantibody levels directed at di-, tri- and penta-saccharide forms of the gal carbohydrate
serum samples from monkeys infused with pig hepatocytes were tested to determine whether igm and igg xenoantibodies with specificity for αgal carbohydrate and for pig aortic endothelial  xenoantigens were induced. as shown in figure  <dig>  there was an increase in binding of igm  and igg  xenoantibodies directed at pig endothelial antigens post-cell infusion. the increase in igm levels from day  <dig> to day  <dig> in monkey # <dig> and the increase in pre and post infusion levels of igg xenoantibodies were significant . the day  <dig> timepoint was used to identify the immunoglobulin genes encoding xenoantibodies later in this study. these data indicated that the injection of pig hepatocytes was successful in eliciting humoral igm and igg xenoantibody responses. we also tested the serum from both animals to identify whether antibodies directed at the di-, tri- and penta-saccharide forms of αgal were induced . igm  and igg  levels against all three oligosaccharide forms of αgal increased after cell infusions. the increase in anti-gal igm xenoantibodies shown from day  <dig> to day  <dig> were statistically significant for both monkeys. for the igg response, , monkey # <dig> demonstrated a significant increase in antibodies directed at gal tri- and pentasaccharides; the binding for the di-saccharide form was significant at pfi day  <dig> 

we then identified the subclass of igg which were elevated during the xenoantibody response. as shown in figure  <dig>  there was an increase in igg <dig> and igg <dig> at day  <dig>  igg <dig> became significantly elevated later, and remained high for the duration of the study. the xenoantibody responses in rhesus monkeys are consistent with those seen in humans following exposure to porcine hepatocytes during the bal procedure  <cit> .

despite the increase in anti-αgal igm and igg xenoantibody levels following pig hepatocyte exposure, we determined that there was very little fluctuation in the total levels of both igm and igg during the ninety-day course of the experiment as shown by elisa using a standard curve . our results concur with other published data showing that the levels of total igm and igg can remain unchanged during the course of experiments in which anti-gal levels fluctuate due to xenoantibody depletion and xenoantibody return  <cit> .

immunoglobulin gene expression was increased in the vh <dig> and vh <dig> families
semi-quantitative pcr was initially performed to determine the ig gene families in which elevated expression could be identified post-exposure to porcine hepatocytes. the results demonstrated that gene expression in the vh <dig> family was elevated, and a modest increase in vh <dig> expression was also identified . these results were confirmed by colony filter hybridization using vh family specific primers to quantitate changes in immunoglobulin gene family usage prior to and following porcine hepatocyte exposure . igm libraries were then prepared to identify the germline progenitors encoding xenoantibodies in non-human primates mounting active xenoantibody responses to porcine hepatocytes. we screened for the presence of human genes that encode xenoantibodies  <cit> , and ighv3-11cyno, a cynomolgus monkey gene that closely matches an allele of ighv3- <dig>  this gene was expressed at high levels in cynomolgus monkeys that have been transplanted with transgenic porcine heart grafts .

we found that ighv3- <dig> and ighv3-11cyno were up-regulated post-exposure in the vh <dig> igm cdna libraries prepared from both porcine-cell infused animals and liver lobe-transplanted animals, albeit with different kinetics . the ighv3- <dig> gene was expressed with greater frequency earlier in the course of the experiment, while ighv3-11cyno usage increased later. in hepatocyte-infused animals, ighv3- <dig> expression rose by day  <dig> to as much as 20% of the vh <dig> pbl cdna igm library. by day  <dig>  ighv3-11cyno expression was detected at high levels. sequencing of at least  <dig> clones for each of the cdna libraries indicated that no significant expression of any other vh <dig> germline progenitors was determined, including those vh <dig> genes shown to encode anti-αgal antibodies in normal individuals  <cit> .

 <dig> = defined as the number of ighv3-11cyno and ighv3- <dig> clones out of the total number of vh <dig> positive clones in each library. between  <dig> to  <dig> vh <dig> positive colonies were represented in each library. a = days are post-first injection 

we then transplanted rhesus monkeys with a porcine liver lobe xenograft to determine whether igvh genes encoding xenoantibodies induced following exposure to a solid organ graft are similar to those induced following exposure to isolated hepatocytes. a rapid increase in expression of both ighv3- <dig> and ighv3-11cyno vh <dig> family genes was detected in the cdna libraries post-porcine liver lobe transplantation. at four hours after establishment of circulation through the xenograft, the percent expression of both ighv3- <dig> and ighv3-11cyno had dramatically increased, from 5% at the pre-transplant time point to  <dig> %, as identified by colony filter hybridization. a marked increase in mrna expression, occurring within  <dig> minutes post-stimulation of b cells, has similarly been reported in other studies  <cit> . the rapid increase in ighv3- <dig> gene expression following exposure to the porcine liver may be due to the antigenic load of αgal epitopes, as it is postulated that there were far more endothelial cells and hepatocytes in the roughly  <dig> g solid liver lobe than the approximately  <dig> million individual cells given per hepatocyte infusion  <cit> .

in order to identify the igvh genes encoding xenoantibodies in the vh <dig> family, we prepared libraries using vh <dig> family-specific primers from the peripheral blood of monkeys at day  <dig> and at  <dig> days following porcine hepatocyte exposure. an increase in the expression of a monkey gene most similar to the human ighv4- <dig> germline gene was demonstrated. the expression of this gene rose from  <dig> % at day  <dig> to  <dig> % at pi day  <dig>  as determined by colony-filter hybridization, and confirmed by nucleic acid sequencing. our laboratory recently reported that this germline progenitor showed an increase in expression in vh <dig> libraries of human bal patients post-porcine cell exposure  <cit> . the results of our analysis indicate the igvh gene usage in humans and rhesus monkeys is very similar following exposure to porcine hepatocytes.

dna sequences of igvh genes encoding xenoantibodies in rhesus monkeys and humans are highly homologous
- dna sequencing reveals high sequence identity to human ighv3- <dig> and vh4- <dig> germline genes
we sequenced multiple ighv3- <dig> and ighv3-11cyno- positive clones from cdna libraries prepared at several time points post-transplantation in all animals studied. the igm amino acid sequences for the ighv3- <dig> and ighv3-11cyno genes encoding xenoantibodies in the porcine-cell injected monkeys showed very few changes from day  <dig> to pi days  <dig> or  <dig> . the consensus nucleic acid sequence for the ighv3- <dig> gene is 97% identical to human ighv3- <dig> . the cdr <dig> "eylssl" amino acid sequence was associated with the ighv3- <dig> allele hsigvh22b in bal treated humans  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  the monkey ighv3- <dig> sequences selected to encode xenoantibodies post-infusion used an identical cdr <dig>  monkey – specific segments of the cμ and cγ region of the cdna clones, however, clearly distinguished these non-human primate sequences from their human counterparts.

the closest human immunoglobulin germline gene match for the consensus rhesus ighv3-11cyno gene is hsigvh <dig>  an allele of ighv3- <dig>  which shares 93% sequence identity. a ''tsty'' amino acid motif in the cdr <dig> of ighv3-11cyno appears to be unique; the nucleic acids encoding this region do not match any known human or primate germline immunoglobulin genes in genbank®  <cit> . the ighv3-11cyno clones used the cdr <dig> segment ''gldgdygvy'', regardless of whether the xenograft exposure was due to individual pig cells or a liver lobe graft. this cdr <dig> was not found in association with any other vh <dig> gene that we have sequenced thus far from these igm libraries.

the sequence of the igvh genes encoding xenoantibodies in the vh <dig> family were found to be most similar to the human ighv4- <dig> germline progenitor. sixteen clones were sequenced from the day  <dig> and day  <dig> igm cdna libraries. we generated a day  <dig> consensus nucleic acid sequence that showed a sequence similarity of 89% to an allele of human ighv4- <dig>  dp <dig>  <cit>  and a 92% similarity to the macaque vh <dig> germline gene mmu <dig>  <cit>  . by pi day  <dig> there are two amino acid changes in the consensus sequence in the cdr <dig> region and one in the cdr <dig> region. the day  <dig> consensus sequence shares 92% nucleic sequence identity with the human dp <dig> germline gene. genes encoding xenoantibodies in the vh <dig> family in rhesus monkeys are very similar to those identified in the human bal study  <cit> .

by day  <dig>  igg xenoantibodies are expressed at high levels. genes encoding igg xenoantibodies were cloned and sequenced from the vh <dig> libraries prepared at day  <dig> and day  <dig> . numerous mutations occurred in the igg xenoantibodies expressed in these animals compared with the igm clones that we had sequenced. the closest germline match, however, was to the human and rhesus ighv3- <dig> germline progenitor. similar mutations were also seen in human ighv3- <dig> igg sequences obtained from patients at  <dig> days after bal treatment  <cit> . no clones corresponding to ighv3-11cyno were detected or sequenced from either timepoint in the igg libraries.

discussion
multiple experimental studies have led to the development of novel anti-rejection techniques designed to eliminate the hyperacute and acute xenograft rejection responses in lower primates by reducing or eliminating xenoantibody circulation and/or production  <cit> . unfortunately, once treatment is terminated, xenoantibody levels rapidly return. if the genetic control of these antibodies were understood, the b cells encoding them could be targeted and potentially eliminated  <cit> , ensuring the persistence of low circulating xenoantibody levels and improved graft survival in the transplant recipient. for example, a reduction of up to 87% of the cytotoxicity of baboon xenoantibodies was recently achieved, using anti-idiotypic antibodies generated against human anti-αgal antibodies  <cit> . our laboratory has focused on understanding the structure of the xenoantibody binding pocket and the use of this information to apply computer-simulated drug design to identify novel drugs and reagents capable of preventing xenograft rejection.

in this study, we examined the humoral immunoglobulin response in rhesus monkeys injected with porcine hepatocytes, and compared this with the immune response following exposure to hepatocytes transplanted as a solid organ. we found no significant differences in the humoral response to hepatocytes expressed as solid organs or isolated cells. although an analysis of the immune response in non-human primates placed on a bal would have most closely mimicked our prior studies in human patients, this was not feasible within our experimental design.

we found a statistically significant elevation of xenoantibody levels directed at di-, tri- and pentasaccharide forms of the gal carbohydrate. these results are correlated with a previous study from our laboratory in which the immune responses of human patients treated with one or more bal devices containing porcine hepatocytes was assessed  <cit> . targets of this response included all forms of αgal. the subclasses of igg xenoantibodies induced were similar to those previously reported in humans  <cit> , indicating that an analogous immunoglobulin response is induced in humans and rhesus monkeys exposed to carbohydrate xenoantigens.

xenoantibodies expressed by patients mounting an active humoral response are encoded by two vh <dig> family germline genes  <cit> , which appear to be selectively expanded from a small number of genes that encode anti-αgal antibodies in naïve individuals  <cit> . in our present study, we detected a similar selective expansion of vh <dig> family genes that were homologous to those encoding xenoantibodies in the bal-treated human patients  <cit> . through nucleic acid sequencing of the igm libraries, we were able to confirm that the genes encoding the majority of xenoantibodies were most closely-related to the human germline ighv3- <dig> gene, while a small proportion of xenoantibodies are encoded by a gene most similar to the human ighv4- <dig> germline gene. the ighv3-11cyno gene was not found to be elevated post-exposure in the human igm or igg libraries when examined up to  <dig> days post-bal treatment. single chain antibodies encoded by this gene, however, can bind to the gal carbohydrate as shown by the ability of these antibodies to partially block human natural antibody binding to gal . the lack of expression of this gene in human patient samples may possibly be due to differences in the route of exposure to xenoantigens expressed on hepatocytes. bal devices contain pores that limit exposure to porcine xenoantigens. although the hepatocyte preparation we used for our study contained a combination of porcine hepatocytes and endothelial cells that was comparable to that found in a bal device , the route of exposure may account for the fact that the ighv3-11cyno gene was not induced in the study in human patients.

in humans, igm vh genes encoding xenoantibodies induced following xenoantibody exposure were expressed in germline configuration  <cit> . a separate study involving the spectrotypic analysis of human anti-αgal antibodies reported similar results  <cit> . this is in agreement with prior work in our lab demonstrating that genes expressed in germline configuration encode xenoantibodies in several small animal models of xenograft rejection  <cit> . comparison of nucleic acid sequences to known germline genes in rhesus monkeys indicates that the closest non-human primate germline gene is a monkey homolog of ighv3- <dig> . since the discovery and reporting of rhesus monkey germline immunoglobulin genes is still in the early stages, there are currently insufficient numbers of nucleic acid sequences for germline progenitors at this time to conclusively determine whether or not the igm xenoantibodies in rhesus monkeys are expressed in germline configuration  <cit> . the conservation in the sequence and structure of the genes encoding xenoantibodies in humans and non-human primates, however, suggests that the unique binding pocket formed by these igm natural antibodies have an optimal affinity for carbohydrate xenoantigens.

the structural features of the xenoantibody/gal binding pocket and the role of the cdr <dig> in binding specificity for gal and other carbohydrates are currently under investigation in our laboratory. the cdr <dig> region is important as both its sequence and its length can be indicative of the level of diversity in the genetic repertoire  <cit> , and it may play a direct role in the formation of the antigen-specific binding site  <cit> . approximately 95% of all ighv3- <dig> clones sequenced from these monkeys used the same cdr <dig> as that used by the human patients in the bal study  <cit> . additionally, 100% of the ighv3-11cyno clones sequenced post-exposure used the same cdr <dig> sequence, which was different than that associated with the ighv3- <dig> gene. the study that had examined the genes used by naïve humans encoding anti-αgal antibodies found the cdr <dig> region to be highly divergent in both composition and length  <cit> . our results suggest that a particular combination of vh gene and cdr <dig> is effective in binding with sufficient affinity to αgal epitopes to be selected for further expansion. the relative affinities of the ighv3-11cyno and ighv3- <dig> gene products to αgal and/or other structurally-related carbohydrates should provide further insight into the molecular basis for the selective usage of these genes encoding xenoantibodies.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings show that rhesus monkeys transplanted with hepatocytes expressed as cells or as a solid organ xenograft develop a humoral response encoded by similar genes as those encoding humoral xenograft responses in human patients  <cit> . this consistency of response will allow for the development of clinical therapies in lower primates that can directly be transferred to humans.
