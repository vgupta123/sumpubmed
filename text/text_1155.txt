BACKGROUND
auxin regulates numerous aspects of plant growth and development. to date, auxin has been linked to the control of cell elongation and division, tropic responses to light and gravity, general root and shoot architecture, organ patterning, responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli, vascular development, and growth in tissue culture  <cit> . phytohormones are involved in many distinct and/or overlapping processes throughout the life cycle of plants. auxin facilitates hormonal crosstalk by regulating the expression of auxin-responsive genes  <cit> . for example, several acs genes, which encode enzymes involved in ethylene biosynthesis, are induced by auxin  <cit> . auxin homeostasis and the auxin response pathway are regulated by several groups of auxin-responsive genes, including the gretchen hagen <dig>  family. jasmonate resistant  <dig>  belongs to the gh <dig> gene family in oryza sativa  and is involved in jasmonate signaling  <cit> . in addition, atgh3- <dig> acts as a bifunctional modulator of both salicylic acid  and auxin signaling during pathogen infection  <cit> . auxin also regulates the expression of several genes in the gibberellic acid  biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . moreover, auxin homeostasis links growth regulation with stress adaptation responses. for instance, plants subjected to stress conditions exhibit retarded growth, altered patterns of metabolism, and changes in the expression and/or activity of auxin-regulated genes  <cit> . furthermore, the repression of auxin signaling in arabidopsis enhances antibacterial resistance  <cit> .

auxin homeostasis and the auxin response pathway are regulated by several groups of auxin-responsive genes, including the gretchen hagen <dig>  family  <cit> . gh <dig> was first identified in glycine max  as an early auxin-responsive gene  <cit> . to date, gh <dig> homologs have been indentified in chlorophyta, bryophyta, coniferophyta, and magnoliophyta <cit> . gh <dig> family genes are divided into three groups  based on their sequence similarities and the substrate specificities of their products in arabidopsis, which harbors  <dig> gh <dig> members and one incomplete gh <dig> protein.  <cit> . group i gh <dig> enzymes are ja-amido or sa-amido synthetases  <cit> . arabidopsis group ii enzymes were demonstrated to be active on iaa  <cit> . group iii enzymes have only been identified in arabidopsis to date. group ii gh <dig> functions in the negative feedback regulation of iaa concentration. several arabidopsis group ii gh3s help maintain auxin homeostasis by conjugating excess iaa to amino acids, either for storage or degradation  <cit> . members of this gene family are known to be regulated by phytohormones and biotic/abiotic stress factors, including abscisic acid , sa, ja, drought, cold, salt, pathogen infection, and light  <cit> . gh3-mediated auxin homeostasis is an essential constituent of the complex network of auxin activity that regulates stress adaptation responses  <cit> . recent research has shown that overexpression of gh <dig> reduced auxin content and changed plant architecture and plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stress. overexpression of tld1/osgh <dig>  in the rice tld1-d mutant resulted in iaa deficiency, dramatic changes in plant architecture, and enhanced drought tolerance  <cit> . overexpression of osgh <dig>  and osgh <dig>  in rice resulted in reduced auxin content, arrested plant growth and development, abnormal plant morphology, and enhanced pathogen resistance  <cit> .

apple is one of the most widely cultivated fruit trees in the world, and is thus of considerable economic value. because biotic/abiotic stresses are crucial factors in determining the distribution and yield of apple trees, improving resistance to stresses has been one of the main breeding objectives in apple. m. sieversii, an apple rootstock with strong drought tolerance, is an ancestral species of modern apple cultivars that is mainly distributed in the tianshan mountains of central asia  <cit> . previous studies in arabidopsis and rice indicated that gh <dig> is involved in the stress response pathway by maintaining auxin homeostasis through conjugating excess iaa to amino acids. in fruit trees, our knowledge of gh <dig> genes is mainly limited to their roles in fruit development. vitis vinifera  gh3- <dig> encodes an iaa-amido synthetase involved in the establishment and maintenance of low iaa concentrations, which enables fruit ripening  <cit> . apple gh <dig> genes were down-regulated during rapid fruit expansion, consistent with the elevated concentrations of auxin observed at this stage  <cit> .

synthetic auxin-responsive promoters, such as dr <dig> <cit> , are widely used as experimental readouts for the auxin response and/or auxin levels in planta  <cit> . dr5::gus contains several copies of a synthetic auxin-responsive element  fused to a 35s minimum promoter and the gus encoding sequence  <cit> . to investigate the role of gh <dig> genes in apple, we examined the expression patterns of these genes in m. sieversii under biotic and abiotic stress conditions and analyzed whether other phytohormones and abiotic stresses could alter the endogenous distribution of auxin using dr5::gus-transformed arabidopsis seedlings. we show that gh <dig> genes play important roles in the crosstalk between auxin, other phytohormones, and abiotic stress factors in m. sieversii by maintaining auxin homeostasis.

RESULTS
genome-wide characterization of the m. domestica gh <dig> family
from the peptide fasta file of m. domestica genome annotations, we identified  <dig> candidate gh <dig> family proteins using the hmmer  <dig>   program. we disregarded seven of the candidates, as they were below the e-value threshold after the first round of searching. furthermore, two sequences were repeats of each other, another four sequences were incomplete, with overlapping regions that could be combined into two complete gh <dig> sequences, and four members were found not to be gh <dig> family proteins using the blastp program at the national center for biotechnology information. therefore,  <dig> unique members were present, all of which were confirmed to be gh <dig> family proteins by the hidden markov model of the smart/pfam tool. among these full-length coding sequences, four mdgh <dig> genes  were further confirmed by rt-pcr amplification, cloning, and sequencing . the mdgh <dig> polypeptide sequences were all of uniform length  and the deduced molecular weight of mdgh <dig> proteins generally ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> kda. multiple sequence alignments showed that the mdgh3s were highly conserved . all of the mdgh3s contained a highly conserved gh <dig> domain that did not match any other motif in the pfam database. pairwise analyses of the full-length protein sequences showed that the overall sequence identities ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % . interestingly, mdgh3s formed homeologous pairs, with the sequence identities of homeologous pairs being extremely high; e.g., mdgh3-1/mdgh3- <dig> , mdgh3-3/mdgh3- <dig> , mdgh3-5/mdgh3- <dig> , mdgh3-7/mdgh3- <dig> , mdgh3-9/mdgh3- <dig> , mdgh3-11/mdgh3- <dig> , and mdgh3-13/mdgh3- <dig> . then, we examined the phylogenetic relationship and exon–intron organization of apple gh <dig> family members. as shown in figure  <dig>  the homeologous pairs exhibited a close evolutionary relationship and similar gene structures. all of the mdgh <dig> genes contained two or three introns, and most had a similar intron phase distribution. we also analyzed the chromosomal location of mdgh3s, and found that all  <dig> mdgh3s were distributed on  <dig> of  <dig> chromosomes. four mdgh <dig> genes were present on chromosome  <dig>  including a distinct tandem duplicate gene cluster with two tandem genes ; two were present on chromosome  <dig> and also on 5; and one each on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  none of the mdgh <dig> genes were located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig>  twelve of  <dig> mdgh3s, including homeologous pairs mdgh3-1/mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3-3/mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3-9/mdgh3- <dig>  and mdgh3-11/mdgh3- <dig>  were mapped on the segmental duplication regions according to information from the symap database .

mdgh <dig> promoter and est analyses
cis-acting regulatory dna elements on both strands of the mdgh <dig> promoter were identified using the place web server , and different dna elements predicted to be involved in the plant’s response to phytohormones and biotic and abiotic stress were found. the dna elements included multiple copies of cacgtg ; tgtctc  binding site); acttta ; catatg ; tgacg ; ttgac ; aacgtg ; acgtg and cacatg ; ccgac ; gaaaaa ; and tgtga, aaagat, and ttgacc  . a blastn search of the m. domestica est database , which is available at the ncbi webserver , confirmed the transcriptional activity of most mdgh3s, but the frequency of ests for individual genes varied greatly . for example,  <dig> ests were identified for mdgh3- <dig> and  <dig> for mdgh3- <dig>  whereas no ests had been deposited for mdgh3- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> .

phylogenetic relationship between m. domestica and arabidopsis gh <dig> family members and atgh <dig> expression analysis using genevestigator
before analyzing the expression pattern of mdgh3s, we performed a preliminary study of atgh <dig> expression. to examine the phylogenetic relationship between m. domestica and arabidopsis gh <dig> family members, a phylogenetic tree was constructed from alignments of their full-length protein sequences. whereas atgh3s can be clustered into three sequence homology groups  <cit> , mdgh <dig> proteins are only present in two of these . most of the atgh3/mdgh <dig> proteins showed a 1: <dig> orthologous relationship, such as atgh3- <dig> from arabidopsis and the gene pair from apple, mdgh3- <dig> and - <dig>  based on the arabidopsis microarray data, we found that many of the atgh3s were significantly up-regulated under phytohormone and biotic/abiotic stress treatment . most arabidopsis group ii enzymes were induced by auxin; atgh <dig> , atgh <dig> , atgh <dig> , and atgh <dig>  were elevated over 10-fold after iaa treatment and atgh <dig>  and atgh <dig>  were induced to a lesser extent . atgh <dig>  and atgh <dig>  expression exhibited no remarkable changes in response to auxin. in contrast, no members of the other two groups showed an obvious response to auxin. only three atgh <dig> members  were induced over 3-fold within  <dig> h of aba treatment. atgh3- <dig> and atgh3- <dig> were slightly induced  under sa and methyl jasmonate  treatments. upon cold treatment, atgh3- <dig> expression increased over 7-fold in the green tissue, and atgh3- <dig> was elevated over 10-fold in the root. after drought treatment, only atgh3- <dig> was induced over 6-fold in the root, while the other members had no remarkable response. in response to heat, atgh3- <dig> and atgh3- <dig> increased over 3-fold. salinity treatment caused a marked induction of atgh3- <dig>  atgh3- <dig>  atgh3- <dig>  and atgh3- <dig> expression in the root. all treatments considered, atgh3- <dig> and atgh3- <dig> responded to most of phytohormone and abiotic stresses, while some of the other atgh <dig> respond to some treatments.

differential expression of mdgh3s
to determine the expression level of mdgh3s, qrt-pcr was performed with total rna isolated from the leaf and root tissues of micropropagated m. sieversii plants. given the high degree of sequence identity between homeologous pairs , it was challenging to design optimal qrt-pcr primers that were specific for each gene. since the primers designed for mdgh3- <dig> and mdgh3- <dig> were predicted to be unable to differentiate between the homeologues, the expression patterns are given with both names . the expression level of the apple histoneh <dig> gene was assumed to be 1e+ <dig>  and was selected as an internal standard in the analysis. qrt-pcr analysis revealed that mdgh <dig> genes were differentially expressed in the leaves and roots . mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  and mdgh3- <dig> showed only weak expression in the leaves compared with mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig> and mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3-1/ <dig>  mdgh3- <dig> and mdgh3- <dig> were strongly expressed in roots under natural growth conditions, compared with mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  and mdgh3- <dig>  most mdgh <dig> genes were more strongly expressed in roots than in leaves, except for mdgh3- <dig>  suggesting that mdgh <dig> genes are root-specific. in particular, mdgh3- <dig> transcripts were over 500-fold higher in roots than in leaves. mdgh3- <dig> and mdgh3- <dig> showed strong expression in both leaves and roots. however, mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig> and mdgh3- <dig> expression showed weak expression under normal growth conditions.

expression pattern of mdgh3s following phytohormone and abiotic stress treatment
iaa treatment caused a dramatic induction of mdgh3- <dig> and mdgh3- <dig> in both the leaves and roots, while the transcript level of mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3-13/ <dig>  and mdgh3- <dig> was not remarkably changed in either of these tissues upon iaa treatment . mdgh3-1/ <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  and mdgh3- <dig> were dramatically upregulated in the leaves only. in contrast, mdgh3- <dig> and mdgh3-9/ <dig> were only induced in the roots under iaa treatment. the expression of most mdgh <dig> genes was not remarkably changed after aba treatment in either the leaves or the roots, whereas the expression of mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  and mdgh3- <dig> in leaves and mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  and mdgh3- <dig> in roots was  <dig> -fold that of the control, suggesting that all of these genes are aba-responsive. interestingly, the expression pattern of mdgh3s was similar after sa and ja treatment. when sa or ja was applied, mdgh3- <dig> and mdgh3- <dig> were upregulated in both the leaves and roots, suggesting that mdgh <dig> proteins participate in the crosstalk between the sa and ja signaling pathways. in contrast, the expression of mdgh3-1/ <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  and mdgh3- <dig> was not altered upon sa or ja treatment in either leaves or roots. the expression of mdgh3- <dig>  and mdgh3- <dig> was upregulated only in leaves upon sa or ja treatment. salinity treatment caused a dramatic induction of mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  in the leaves and mdgh3- <dig> , mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig> in the root. under cold conditions, most mdgh <dig> genes were slightly upregulated, whereas the expression of mdgh3- <dig> rose 39-fold in the leaves. most mdgh3s showed a slight increase in expression in the leaves or roots. in contrast, mdgh3- <dig> and mdgh3- <dig> showed increased expression in both the leaves and roots, under drought stress. however, the expression of mdgh3- <dig> was strongly induced in leaves  and roots  under drought treatment. interestingly, mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  and mdgh3- <dig> were markedly induced in the leaves or roots under iaa, salt, cold, and drought treatment, suggesting that these genes might function in the abiotic stress response.

aba, sa, salt, and cold treatments suppress the auxin response
auxin response elements , which consist of a tgtctc motif and an adjacent or overlapping coupling element, were defined based on the auxin-responsive promoter of the soybean gh <dig> gene  <cit> ). the finding that native and synthetic promoters containing this element are activated following auxin treatment  <cit>  led to the construction of artificial auxin-responsive promoters such as dr <dig> <cit> . a fusion of the dr <dig> promoter with the β-glucuronidase  coding sequence has been frequently used as a maker to monitor endogenous auxin distribution and auxin levels in planta, because the resulting gus activity coincides with the endogenous iaa distribution  <cit> .

to determine whether other phytohormones and abiotic stresses could alter the endogenous distribution of auxin, we examined the response of the auxin-signaling reporter dr5::gus to various plant hormones and abiotic stresses in arabidopsis seedlings. as shown in figure 6a and additional file  <dig>  treatment with  <dig> μm iaa induced high levels of gus activity relative to the control. this result was also observed upon in situ staining for reporter activity in roots, the organs in which the dr <dig> promoter is most active . as shown in figure 6b-e, aba, sa, salt, and cold treatments significantly inhibited auxin-mediated expression of this reporter, and the same results were obtained upon in situ staining for gus activity in roots . in the presence of  <dig> μm aba or  <dig>  mm sa, the increase in gus activity mediated by treatment with  <dig> μm iaa was abolished, and this effect was more significant with increasing concentrations of aba or sa. likewise, upon incubation with  <dig> μm iaa at 4°c, gus activity was significantly lower in the dr5::gus seedlings than in the control. the effect of cold treatment on the suppression of the auxin response was more intense with longer treatments. exposure to a low concentration of nacl enhanced the auxin-mediated expression of gus in dr5::gus seedlings, whereas treatment with a high concentration of nacl significantly inhibited auxin-mediated gus expression. however, as shown in figure  <dig> d, ja treatment had no effect on the auxin-mediated expression of gus in dr5::gus seedlings.

discussion
previous studies showed that the expression of gh <dig> family genes was regulated by various stress conditions  <cit> . most studies of gh <dig> genes focused on the functional analysis of individual genes in arabidopsis, rice, and grapevine  <cit> . with the availability of the whole genome sequence for apple  <cit> , complete gene families for different classes of genes can be readily identified from genome data based on knowledge of conserved domains. a systematic analysis of the characteristics and phylogeny of apple gh <dig> family genes and of their expression patterns upon exposure to phytohormones and abiotic stress would help identify candidates with roles in abiotic/biotic stress responses. gh3-mediated auxin homeostasis is an essential constituent of the complex network that underlies crosstalk between auxin signaling and biotic/abiotic stress signaling  <cit> . we investigated whether other phytohormones and abiotic stresses could alter the endogenous auxin distribution using transgenic arabidopsis seedlings expressing dr5::gus. the results of these analyses will provide the groundwork for further studies on the role of auxin in stress responses.

the evolution of gh <dig> family genes in apple
in this study, we identified  <dig> putative proteins belonging to the gh <dig> family in apple . the number of gh <dig> proteins in apple is similar to that in arabidopsis , rice , and sorghum bicolor    <cit> . multiple sequence alignments showed that gh3s were highly conserved in apple , as they are in sorghum  <cit> . pairwise analyses with the full-length protein sequences showed that the overall amino acid sequence identities of the full-length gh3s were higher in apple  than sorghum. mdgh <dig> genes emerged in homeologous pairs, with very high sequence similarity. the homeologous pairs had close evolutionary relationships and similar gene structures. most of the mdgh <dig> homeologous pairs were also gene pairs in the segmental duplication regions, which suggests that the apple genome underwent duplication. indeed, about  <dig> to  <dig> million years ago , the apple genome underwent a whole-genome duplication  event, which had a great impact on the amplification of members of gene families  <cit> . moreover, these results also indicate that the members of an mdgh <dig> homeologous pair might have descended from a common ancestor and have similar functions.

gh <dig> family genes were divided into three groups  based on their sequence similarities and the substrate specificities of their products in arabidopsis, which harbors  <dig> gh <dig> members and one incomplete gh <dig> protein. group iii gh <dig> enzymes, of which there are nine in arabidopsis, have only been identified in arabidopsis to date  <cit> . our phylogenetic analysis of arabidopsis and apple gh <dig> proteins revealed three groups that exhibited distinct orthologous relationships, and no group iii enzymes in apple . most of the atgh3s/mdgh <dig> pairs showed a 1: <dig> orthologous relationship. considering the total number of gh <dig> family members, genomic duplications were not instrumental in the evolutionary history of the gh <dig> family in arabidopsis  <cit> . in contrast, genomic duplications had a great impact on the amplification of members of the gh <dig> family in apple. this finding also indicates that mdgh3s might have begun to diversify as a result of gene duplication. some atgh3/mdgh <dig> pairs exhibited an n:n orthologous relationship, which indicates that the functions of these family members had started to diversify in both arabidopsis and apple. however, mdgh3- <dig> has distant orthologous relationships with the other gh <dig> proteins.

gh <dig> family members involved in plant responses to phytohormones and abiotic stress
to predict the functions of the mdgh <dig> genes, we analyzed their promoters and ests. the promoters of mdgh <dig> contained numerous dna elements predicted to be induced by phytohormones and biotic and abiotic stresses, suggesting that the expression of mdgh3s is regulated by phytohormones and biotic and abiotic stresses . transcriptional activity was confirmed for most of the mdgh3s, and the frequency of ests implied that genes were expressed at various levels in different tissues . sequence homology analysis represents an important method for predicting gene function. thus, we examined the expression patterns of atgh3s under phytohormone and biotic/abiotic stress treatment, using the gene expression search engine, genevestigator. some of the gh <dig> family members responded to both phytohormones and abiotic stress in arabidopsis .

our qrt-pcr analysis showed that almost all mdgh3s were expressed at a higher level in the roots than in the leaves under normal conditions, indicating that these proteins may be involved in root growth and development . the ydk1-d and dfl1-d arabidopsis activation-tagged mutants, which have a t-dna insertion proximal to a arabidopsis group ii gh <dig> gene, have short primary roots and a reduced number of lateral roots  <cit> . gh <dig> was first identified in glycine max as an early auxin-responsive gene  <cit> . many of the gh <dig> genes in arabidopsis, soybean, and sorghum can be induced by applying exogenous auxin  <cit> . with the exception of gh <dig> , all group ii gh3s in arabidopsis were demonstrated to be iaa-amido synthetases  <cit> . in agreement with the gh <dig> family expression pattern determined from arabidopsis microarray data, all gh <dig> genes of group ii, except mdgh3- <dig> and mdgh3- <dig>  were dramatically upregulated in apple under iaa treatment, suggesting that the group ii proteins from apple might also be iaa-amido synthetases . however, the expression of most mdgh <dig> genes was not markedly changed after aba treatment. the expression of mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  and mdgh3- <dig> in the leaves and of mdgh3- <dig> and mdgh3- <dig> in the roots rose two-fold compared with the control, suggesting that all of these genes are involved in the aba signaling pathway . sa and ja are known to play key roles in plant defense, and sa- and ja-dependent defense pathways exhibit crosstalk with each other  <cit> . interestingly, the expression pattern of mdgh <dig> genes was similar under sa and ja treatment, which suggests that mdgh3s might participate in the crosstalk between sa- and ja-dependent defense pathways . in rice, wild-type seedlings subjected to various abiotic stresses showed a dramatic increase in the transcription of osgh3- <dig>  osgh3- <dig>  and osgh3- <dig> compared with control seedlings  <cit> . in arabidopsis, wes <dig>  was strongly induced by aba and sa treatment and pathogen infections  <cit> . in sorghum, sbgh3- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were markedly induced in leaves upon salt and drought stress treatments  <cit> . previous studies showed that gh <dig> genes were regulated by various phytohormones and biotic/abiotic stresses. our analysis of microarray data from arabidopsis revealed that atgh3- <dig> and atgh3- <dig> were induced by most phytohormone and abiotic stress treatments . in this study, some mdgh3s were markedly induced in response to various phytohormones and biotic/abiotic stress treatments, particularly mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  and mdgh3- <dig> . interestingly, our results showed that mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  atgh3- <dig>  and atgh3- <dig> were close evolutionary relatives . taken together, these findings suggest that the mdgh <dig> gene family participates in the stress adaptation response, and that mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  and mdgh3- <dig> may play important roles in this response.

aba, sa, salt, and cold treatments suppress the auxin response
a comprehensive study of the effects of sa on auxin signaling based on the affymetrix ath <dig> gene-chip for arabidopsis thaliana showed that sa causes the global repression of auxin-related genes, including the tir <dig> receptor gene, resulting in the stabilization of aux/iaa repressor proteins and the inhibition of auxin responses  <cit> . an r2r3-type myb transcription factor, myb <dig>  regulates the drought stress response by integrating aba and auxin signals. the myb96-mediated aba signals are integrated into an auxin signaling pathway that involves a subset of gh <dig> genes encoding auxin-conjugating enzymes  <cit> . previous studies indicated that sa and aba have a negative impact on auxin responses. in addition, the gh <dig> gene family can be regulated by phytohormones and biotic/abiotic stress, which act to regulate the auxin pool, effectively modulating auxin responses. we proposed that sa and aba treatments induce gh <dig> expression, which in return reduces the endogenous auxin level. we used dr5::gus, an important tool for localizing regions of auxin responsiveness and/or auxin levels, to test this hypothesis. we detected the effect of various plant hormones and abiotic stress factors on the activity of this reporter in arabidopsis seedlings. aba, sa, salt, and cold treatments significantly inhibited the auxin-mediated expression of this reporter, confirming that endogenous auxin levels could indeed be suppressed by these treatments .

CONCLUSIONS
we performed a genome-wide analysis of the gh <dig> gene family in apple, conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the corresponding proteins, and examined their expression profiles in response to phytohormone and abiotic stress treatment. some mdgh <dig> genes were markedly upregulated upon treatment with various phytohormones and biotic/abiotic stresses, especially mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  mdgh3- <dig>  and mdgh3- <dig>  which were strongly induced in leaves following iaa, drought, cold, and salt treatment . aba, sa, salt, and cold treatments caused a sharp decline in iaa concentration . given that gh <dig> functions in the negative feedback regulation of iaa concentration, we conclude that other phytohormones and abiotic stress factors alter the endogenous distribution of auxin, and that the gh <dig> gene family plays an important role in this process by maintaining auxin homeostasis.
