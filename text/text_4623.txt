BACKGROUND
brain-derived neurotrophic factor   <cit> , a member of the neurotrophin family, promotes survival and differentiation of several neuronal populations during mammalian development  <cit> . in the adult central nervous system, bdnf acts as a regulator of activity-dependent neurotransmission and plasticity  <cit>  and promotes survival of newborn hippocampal neurons  <cit> . bdnf has widespread expression in the developing and adult mammalian nervous system, its mrna and protein levels rising dramatically in postnatal development  <cit> . in the adult, bdnf is also expressed in a number of non-neural tissues, with the highest levels of bdnf mrna detected in thymus, heart and lung  <cit> .

bdnf gene has a complex structure with multiple untranslated 5' exons alternatively spliced to one protein-coding 3' exon. the rat bdnf gene structure initially described to contain five exons  <cit>  has been recently updated with a number of newly discovered exons for rodent  <cit>  and human  <cit>  bdnf. untranslated 5' exons are linked with differentially regulated promoters directing tissue-specific expression of bdnf  <cit> . furthermore, recently discovered bdnf antisense transcripts in human may exert additional control over bdnf transcription  <cit> . bdnf is a neural activity-dependent gene in rodents: various physiological stimuli induce its expression in neurons through excitatory neurotransmission-triggered calcium influx  <cit> . however, no data is available about activity-dependent transcription of the human bdnf gene in neurons, except one report showing that dopamine signaling increases the levels of bdnf exon iv transcripts in neuronally differentiated human embryonic teratocarcinoma nt <dig> cells  <cit> .

alterations in bdnf function have been associated with a variety of disorders of the nervous system  <cit> . as therapies modulating neurotrophic activity are being actively sought  <cit> , it is of great importance to create model systems for studying the regulation of bdnf gene. bac transgenic mice have proven useful in studying gene regulation as a) bac clones are often long enough to contain all necessary dna elements to recapitulate the expression patterns of endogenous genes independent of host genomic sequences flanking the transgene integration site and b) they can be easily modified with homologous recombination in e. coli, e.g. to introduce reporter genes under the control of promoters of interest  <cit> . bac transgenes with egfp reporter gene have been used for characterization of expression and regulatory regions of several neural genes  <cit> . transgenic mice have been generated previously to study bdnf gene regulation in vivo  <cit> . mouse lines carrying rat bdnf sequences of  <dig> kb range recapitulated bdnf expression only partially, suggesting that cis-acting regulatory elements necessary for accurate control of bdnf expression are located further away  <cit> . recently, yac-bdnf transgenic mice carrying  <dig> kb of human bdnf locus with bdnf coding sequence substituted for the egfp reporter gene have been reported  <cit> .

in this study we have generated bac transgenic mice carrying human bdnf-egfp fusion  reporter gene under the control of  <dig> kb of human bdnf genomic sequences. c-terminal addition of egfp to bdnf protein has been shown not to affect bdnf cellular localization, secretion and activation of its receptor trkb in cultured neurons  <cit> . therefore, to enable studying subcellular localization of the hbdnf-egfp fusion protein in vivo, we specifically produced this fusion reporter gene construct. the aims of the study were to investigate a) expression of hbdnf-egfp mrna and protein in the brain and non-neural tissues and b) activity-dependent regulation of the hbdnf-egfp transgene in the brain of the bac transgenic mice.

RESULTS
generation of transgenic mice with  <dig> kb hbdnf-egfp-bac
a  <dig> kb bac clone extending  <dig> kb upstream and  <dig> kb downstream of human bdnf gene was used to generate human bdnf-egfp reporter transgenic mice . briefly, egfp reporter gene was inserted in-frame with bdnf coding region replacing the bdnf stop codon . resulting hbdnf-egfp fusion protein was expected to mimic subcellular localization of endogenous bdnf, allowing fine resolution of transgene expression. hbdnf-egfp-bac construct was tested for integrity using pcr and restriction analysis . transgenic mice were generated by pronuclear injection, yielding four transgenic founders . all founders contained one to two transgene copies as estimated by slot-blot hybridization . pcr analysis of c <dig> genomic dna and sequencing of the pcr products revealed tandem integration of two transgene copies and confirmed the intactness of 5' and 3' end sequences of the integrated transgene . offspring was obtained from three founders and bred for several generations to generate transgenic mouse lines e <dig>  e <dig> and c <dig> 

expression of hbdnf-egfp in transgenic mouse tissues
from three transgenic founder lines, c <dig> line showed pattern of expression of hbdnf-egfp mrnas that was highly similar to the expression of mouse endogenous bdnf  mrna . rt-pcr analysis revealed relatively high transgene expression in all brain regions of c <dig> mice, including cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain, pons, medulla and cerebellum. in non-neural tissues, high levels of transgene mrna were detected in testis, moderate levels in thymus and lung and low levels in skeletal muscle. bdnf mrna is endogenously expressed in all these tissues both in mouse and human  <cit> ; . however, dissimilarly from mouse endogenous bdnf mrna, hbdnf-egfp mrna was not detected in heart and kidney, where relatively high levels of mbdnf mrna were detected. low expression of hbdnf-egfp transgene in the mouse kidney correlates with the finding that bdnf is expressed at low levels in human kidney  <cit> .

in e <dig> mice, transgene expression recapitulated that of the endogenous bdnf mrna in thymus, lung, kidney and testis, but not in other non-neural tissues that express bdnf. in the adult brain of e <dig> mice, transgene mrna expression was detected in midbrain, cerebellum, pons and medulla at levels that were lower than in the respective brain regions of c <dig> mice. in e <dig> line, hbdnf-egfp mrna was detected only in testis and thymus .

expression of transgenic hbdnf-egfp mrna was further examined in different brain regions of c <dig> mice since this line largely recapitulated endogenous bdnf expression and expressed the transgene at the highest levels. quantification of hbdnf-egfp transcripts in c <dig> hippocampus and cortex using ribonuclease protection assay  revealed that transgene mrna levels were about tenfold lower than endogenous mbdnf mrna levels . analysis of transcription from the alternative human bdnf promoters in c <dig> mice confirmed the expression of all transcripts with different 5' exons described to date  both in hippocampus  and cerebral cortex .

in situ hybridization of c <dig> mice adult brain sections revealed hbdnf-egfp mrna expression in the hippocampus, particularly in the pyramidal neurons of ca <dig> and ca <dig> regions and in the polymorphic neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus, and also in several cortical areas, including neurons of frontal, sensorimotor and piriform cortex . endogenous mbdnf mrna was detected in all brain areas where hbdnf-egfp mrna labeling was observed. however, hbdnf-egfp labeling was absent or below the detection limit of our in situ hybridization assay in several areas expressing mbdnf mrna, e.g. claustrum, amygdala, thalamic, hypothalamic and pontine nuclei. furthermore, in situ hybridization showed differential expression of hbdnf and mbdnf in cortical and hippocampal subfields. while mbdnf mrna was expressed at high levels throughout the cerebral cortex, hbdnf-egfp labeling was more prominent in the frontal cortex and in the sensorimotor area extending along the longitudinal fissure . in the hippocampus, hbdnf-egfp labeling was observed over the ca <dig> and hilar subfields and part of the ca <dig> subfield , mimicking the pattern of expression of endogenous mbdnf mrna. on the other hand, hbdnf-egfp mrna was expressed at considerably lower levels in the part of ca <dig> subfield that showed high levels of mbdnf mrna expression . in addition, no hbdnf-egfp labeling was detected in the granule neurons of dentate gyrus where endogenous mbdnf mrna was highly expressed .

since the bdnf gene in the transgenic construct was of human origin, we also analyzed the expression of bdnf in the human hippocampus using in situ hybridization. in agreement with earlier findings  <cit> , our results showed that the highest levels of hbdnf mrna were present in the granule cells of dentate gyrus, whereas other hippocampal regions showed relatively weaker expression . however, strong hbdnf labeling was detected over majority of ca <dig> and ca <dig> neurons using high magnification , indicating that these areas show much weaker signal in the dark-field image partly because of the scarcity of neuronal cell bodies in the ca <dig> and ca <dig> subfields of the human hippocampus.

next we examined expression of hbdnf-egfp fusion protein across tissues in c <dig> mice. no egfp fluorescence was observed in brain sections or cultured primary embryonic  hippocampal neurons. in addition, hbdnf-egfp protein was not detected in the hippocampus, cortex and testis by western blot analysis with anti-egfp or anti-bdnf antibodies . hbdnf-egfp open reading frame in c <dig> genomic dna was analyzed for possible mutations by sequencing and was found to be intact. together with mrna expression data these results suggest that hbdnf-egfp protein was either not translated in the brain and testis of c <dig> mice or was expressed at levels below the detection limits of our methods.

kainic acid induces hbdnf-egfp mrna expression in transgenic mouse brain
kainic acid , agonist of the ka subtype ionotropic glutamate receptor, has been shown to induce bdnf mrna levels in adult rodent hippocampus and cerebral cortex  <cit> . ka induction of transgenic hbdnf-egfp transcripts in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of c <dig> mice largely followed the induction pattern of endogenous mbdnf transcripts . ka markedly upregulated both endogenous mouse and transgenic hbdnf-egfp transcripts containing exons i, iv and 5'-extended exon ix  in the hippocampus and cortex. hbdnf-egfp and mbdnf mrnas containing other 5' exons were induced to a lesser extent. of note, recently described human-specific exon vh-containing transcripts were not induced by ka in transgenic mice in the context of  <dig> kb hbdnf-egfp bac construct .

levels of bdnf transcripts showing the most robust induction by kainic acid were analyzed further using quantitative real-time rt-pcr analysis . transgenic hbdnf-egfp exon i, exon iv and 5'-extended exon ix transcripts, and total hbdnf-egfp mrna were potently induced in both hippocampus and cortex following  <dig> hours of kainate treatment, similarly to respective endogenous mbdnf mrnas. exon vi-containing hbdnf-egfp and endogenous mbdnf transcripts showed no induction, which is consistent with previous findings  <cit> .

in situ hybidization analysis showed marked induction of transgenic hbdnf-egfp mrna by ka in the pyramidal neurons of ca1-ca <dig> layers, in the hilar region of hippocampus and also in the layers ii – vi of cerebral cortex . importantly, kainic acid induced transgene expression also in the granular layer of dentate gyrus of hippocampus, whereas control animals did not show any detectable expression in this area. endogenous mbdnf was induced in the same neuronal populations, suggesting that the  <dig> kb hbdnf-egfp bac construct contains all the regulatory elements that mediate kainic acid induction. we also examined expression of the hbdnf-egfp protein in the brains of kainic acid treated c <dig> mice by direct egfp fluorescence and western blot analysis but no fusion protein was detected .

discussion
in this study, bac transgenic mice carrying  <dig> kb of the human bdnf locus and encoding human bdnf-egfp fusion protein were generated and analyzed. out of three analyzed founder lines, one line  largely recapitulated human bdnf mrna expression in the brain, thymus, lung, skeletal muscle and testis. founder line e <dig> mimicked human bdnf mrna expression in some brain regions, and also in thymus, lung and kidney. founder line e <dig> expressed transgene only in the thymus and testis. these results showed that although all three founder lines expressed hbdnf-egfp mrna at different levels, the  <dig> kb bac construct, carrying  <dig> kb of human bdnf gene,  <dig> kb of 5' and  <dig> kb of 3' sequences, contains regulatory elements necessary for hbdnf mrna expression in many brain regions and non-neural tissues. however, integration site-dependent expression of transgene in different founder lines suggests that the bac construct may not contain necessary insulator elements to protect it from the influence of genomic regions flanking the transgene integration site. it has been shown for many genes that insulators can functionally isolate neighboring genes and block their interactions  <cit> .

in several non-neural tissues, the  <dig> kb hbdnf-egfp bac recapitulated endogenous expression of both mouse and human bdnf. transgenic mrna was expressed in the thymus and testis in three mouse lines, expression in the lung was seen in two lines and only one line expressed hbdnf-egfp in the kidney and skeletal muscle. all these tissues have been shown to express bdnf both in mouse and human  <cit> . of note, all three founder lines expressed relatively high levels of hbdnf-egfp in adult testis, in contrast to the very low expression levels of endogenous mbdnf in the testis. this transgene expression pattern can be explained by human origin of the bdnf gene as relatively high levels of bdnf mrna, comparable to the levels in the brain, have been detected in the human testis  <cit> . in the adult human testis, expression of bdnf and its receptor trkb has been reported in leydig, sertoli and germ cells  <cit> , while in the adult mouse testis, bdnf expression has been detected in sertoli cells and expression of its receptor trkb in germ cells  <cit> . these findings indicate differences in bdnf expression between human and mouse and are further supported by the present study. on the other hand, none of the founder lines expressed hbdnf mrna in the heart, a tissue with high levels of bdnf expression both in human and rodents  <cit> . this suggests that distinct heart-specific regulatory elements are located outside of the genomic dna fragment that was included in the bac construct.

detailed analysis of hbdnf-egfp expression in the c <dig> mouse brain by in situ hybridization showed that the transgene mimicked mbdnf expression in many neuron populations, including neurons of the ca1-ca <dig> and hilar regions of the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex. however, hbdnf-egfp failed to recapitulate endogenous bdnf expression in several neuron populations, including the granule cells of dentate gyrus of hippocampus where bdnf mrna is expressed both in human and rodents. hbdnf-egfp expression was detected in all analyzed brain regions by rt-pcr, but not by in situ hybridization, indicating that transgene mrna levels in several brain structures were below the detection limit of our in situ hybridization analysis.

bdnf transcription is regulated by neuronal activity through calcium-mediated pathways  <cit> . systemic treatment of rodents with kainic acid  has been used to model activity-dependent induction of bdnf mrna in the nervous system  <cit> . here we show that ka differentially induced alternative hbdnf-egfp transcripts in the cortex and hippocampus . pronounced induction of transgenic hbdnf-egfp transcripts containing exons i, iv, and 5'-extended exon ix , moderate induction of transcripts containing exons ii, iii and absence of induction of transcripts containing exon vi is consistent with the induction pattern of respective bdnf mrnas in mouse and rat  <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the first time to report neural activity-dependent regulation of the human bdnf gene in vivo. real-time pcr showed that total transgenic mrna, as well as transcripts containing exons i, iv and 5'-extended exon ix were induced to a lesser extent than the respective endogenous mbdnf mrnas. this is consistent with earlier results reported for shorter rat bdnf transgenes  <cit>  and could be caused by increased stability of transgenic bdnf-reporter mrnas as compared to the mouse endogenous bdnf mrnas. alternatively, the absence of important regulatory elements in the transgenic construct may underlie the reduced induction of the transgene by kainic acid. in situ hybridization analysis of ka-treated c <dig> mouse brains showed induction of hbdnf-egfp mrnas in several neuronal populations where endogenous bdnf mrna levels were also increased. these results show that, similarly to rodent bdnf, expression of the human bdnf gene is induced by neural activity and that regulatory elements mediating the induction are included in the  <dig> kb of the human bdnf locus contained in the bac transgene. several regulatory elements located in the rat bdnf proximal promoter iv and the transcription factors mediating activity-dependent activation of this promoter have previously been characterized  <cit> . among these elements, cre  was found to be the most important for ca2+-mediated activation of rodent bdnf promoter iv  <cit> . however, the respective regulatory elements and transcription factors responsible for the activity-dependent regulation of the human bdnf gene have not been characterized. transgenic mice described here can be used to study the regulation of human bdnf gene in vivo using a variety of methods successfully applied in the studies of rodent bdnf  <cit> .

previously, transgenic mice carrying shorter fragments of the bdnf locus have been generated and characterized  <cit> . mice expressing the cat reporter gene under the control of  <dig> kb of rat bdnf genomic sequences covering promoters i-iii or promoters iv-vi showed relatively high cat activity in most tissues and brain regions expressing endogenous bdnf mrna. in situ hybridization analysis showed that these constructs carrying either bdnf promoters i-iii or iv-vi were able to drive cat mrna expression in adult rat brain in a pattern largely overlapping with mouse bdnf mrna expression. nevertheless, recapitulation of endogenous bdnf expression had a number of shortcomings in these transgenes: both constructs were not expressed or were expressed at low levels in the dentate granule cells and granule cells of cerebellum; bdnf iv-vi did not mimic bdnf expression in the heart; both constructs displayed relatively high reporter activity in the striatum where rat bdnf is virtually not expressed  <cit> . it was assumed that these transgenic constructs lacked important regulatory elements, which could be present in a much longer gene fragment than the bac clone used here. although bac transgenic mouse lines generated in this study showed improved recapitulation of expression as compared to that of the bdnf-cat transgenic mice  <cit> , we could not detect transgene expression in several tissues and neuron populations that express endogenous bdnf mrna.

a recent study reported generation of human bdnf-egfp transgenic mice using a  <dig> kb yac clone including  <dig> kb of 5' and  <dig> kb of 3' flanking sequences of hbdnf gene with the protein coding sequence partially replaced with egfp reporter gene  <cit> . three out of five transgenic founder lines obtained in that study expressed transgenic mrna in the brain and only one of these showed expression of transgenic hbdnf transcripts containing exons iv and vi in the heart. out of three lines analyzed, egfp fluorescence was detected in the brain of only one line, specifically in the claustrum, intermediate layer of parietal cortex, pyramidal cell layer of ca <dig> hippocampal subfield and a population of neurons in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. however, egfp fluorescence was not detected in other cortical neuron populations and in the ca <dig> region of hippocampus where rodent and also human bdnf mrna are expressed  <cit> . differences in the tissue- and neuron-specific expression of transgenic hbdnf-egfp mrna and protein between the study by guillemot et al.  <cit>  and this study can be explained with different lengths of the bdnf gene-flanking genomic regions in the transgenic constructs used: the hbdnf-bac used in the present study contained  <dig> kb longer 5' and  <dig> kb shorter 3' genomic regions of hbdnf gene than the reported hbdnf-yac construct  <cit> . in addition, part of bdnf coding sequence had been replaced with egfp reporter gene in the hbdnf-yac transgene  <cit> , possibly removing cis-elements with regulatory function. in contrast to the present study, hbdnf-yac transgenic mrna expression was not analyzed in different brain regions and expression of transgenic mrnas containing exons iii, v, vh, vii and 5'-extended exon ix was not analyzed. more detailed comparison of hbdnf-egfp expression in the two hbdnf transgenic mouse models would allow narrowing down genomic regions containing enhancer elements for tissue-specific expression of human bdnf. for example, on the basis of current data it can be hypothesized that a cis-element promoting heart-specific expression of hbdnf mrna is located within the 3' terminal  <dig> kb of hbdnf-yac construct . recently, a bdnf regulatory locus has been discovered  <dig> kb upstream of the human and mouse bdnf genes that causes obesity, cognitive impairment and hyperactivity when disrupted  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that in addition to regulatory elements included in the hbdnf-bac of this study and the hbdnf-yac described before  <cit> , others can be found hundreds of kilobases away from the bdnf gene.

egfp reporter gene has been successfully used to visualize bac-driven expression of neural genes in a number of studies  <cit> . in the bac construct that was used to generate transgenic mice in the present study, egfp reporter gene was fused c-terminally with the human bdnf coding sequence to allow detailed characterization of human bdnf expression in the nervous system. unfortunately, we could not detect egfp protein in the brain of c <dig> mice neither with fluorescence microscopy nor with western blot analysis. this could be explained with low levels of hbdnf-egfp protein expressed in the c <dig> mouse brain as transgenic hbdnf-egfp mrna levels were about tenfold lower than these of endogenous bdnf. it is also possible that founder mice with higher levels of bdnf-egfp expression died during embryonic development due to overactivation of bdnf receptor trkb. this hypothesis is supported by a study showing that embryonic overexpression of bdnf from nestin promoter results in gross abnormalities in brain architecture and perinatal death  <cit> . although the hbdnf-egfp fusion protein can be expressed in cultured cells in vitro  <cit> , it is conceivable that it is not translated or has poor translatability and/or stability when expressed in transgenic mice in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
human genomic region covering  <dig> kb of the bdnf gene,  <dig> kb of upstream and  <dig> kb of downstream sequences is able to drive tissue-specific and kainic acid-induced expression of reporter gene in transgenic mice that largely overlaps with bdnf gene expression and regulation in mouse and human. this is the first study to directly show that human bdnf gene is regulated by neural activity. the bdnf-bac transgenic mice are useful for studying the transcription regulation of human bdnf gene in vivo. in addition, these mice could be used for screening therapeutic agents modulating human bdnf transcription.
