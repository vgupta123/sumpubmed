BACKGROUND
one of the major priorities in genome analysis is to determine the joint inheritance and the population-wide associations among contiguous alleles on the same chromosome. this is known as the haplotype structure of a population and it is an essential part of the genetic architecture. the haplotype structure determines the usefulness of closely linked markers in identifying disease-susceptible individuals or genetically superior livestock. it also influences genetic interactions. for example, a polymorphism in a promoter, an enhancer or another regulatory element may interact differently with an allele on the same or on an opposing chromosomal strand.

either deductive or direct approaches can be used to define haplotypes. the deductive approach infers haplotypes from the inheritance patterns in families or from the observed associations among genotypes  <cit> . this approach is widely used. however, the algorithms can have error rates between  <dig> and 48%  <cit> .

direct approaches analyse single chromosomes. the first techniques used cloning and sequencing  <cit> , but this is time-consuming and impractical for large populations. subsequently, snp were used to design allele specific primers and the resulting products were then sequenced. this approach was used to haplotype a  <dig>  kb fragment spanning the apoe gene  <cit>  and a  <dig> kb portion of the human glucocorticoid receptor  <cit> . lo et al  <cit>  used allele-specific forward and reverse primers to haplotype two snp's < <dig> bp apart. this work was further developed by eitan and kashi  <cit>  who determined the haplotypes of  <dig> snp in a  <dig> bp segment of the chicken hsp  <dig> gene. while this method allows long regions of dna to be haplotyped, it is a two stage process, requiring initial sequencing or genotyping to define suitablele snp that can be used for allele specific pcr. unfortunately, the fragments that can be analyzed are of limited size, and the dependence on electrophoresis as the end point greatly limits sample throughput. clearly, a simple, reliable and rapid method for direct haplotyping is urgently needed.

the approach that we have developed has two stages. in the first stage, pcr is performed in the presence of all forward and reverse primers both in solution and linked to the beads. this overcomes some of the difficulties of solid phase pcr  <cit>  by allowing in-solution amplification of products, which are subsequently 'kidnapped' to the solid phase. in the second stage, the beads are washed free of non-covalently linked dna, interrogated by allele specific primer extension with individual fluorescently labeled primers, washed and analyzed. this is a fully automatable procedure with a high degree of internal quality control.

we chose to test this procedure on the drb <dig> locus of the sheep major histocompatibility complex. this locus and its homologues is among the most polymorphic in the mammalian genome. in sheep, over  <dig> alleles have been identified at this locus but additional alleles are believed to exist. the combination of high levels of diversity with unknown alleles provided a rigorous test of our procedure. in addition, sheep are an important commercial species and the drb <dig> locus is associated with resistance to nematode infection  <cit> , which is a major disease of livestock including sheep  <cit> . therefore any results would have both scientific and commercial relevance.

RESULTS
of the  <dig> nucleotides examined in exon  <dig> at the drb <dig> locus,  <dig>  were polymorphic. the majority of polymorphic sites were biallelic with only two nucleotides, but a substantial proportion had three or even four different nucleotides .

the direct haplotyping procedure identified  <dig> exon  <dig> alleles at the drb <dig> locus in  <dig> scottish blackface rams. pcr using allele-specific primers and sequencing gave identical results. both techniques identified one or two exon  <dig> alleles in all animals. therefore both techniques appeared to identify all alleles in the population.

the majority of these exon  <dig> alleles had not been previously identified in this breed of sheep, while two exon  <dig> alleles had not been previously identified in sheep of any breed. they were assigned genebank accession numbers fj <dig> and fj <dig>  these new alleles both represented novel combinations of nucleotides previously reported to be polymorphic. both exon  <dig> alleles have been independently confirmed .

the allele assignments were made by the immunopolymorphism database <cit> . n/a: no assignment exists as yet . the allele names are the genbank accession numbers. in several instances, there were several identical alleles with different accession numbers in the genbank database; in this case one accession number was arbitrarily chosen for clarity.

the names of the exon  <dig> alleles are listed in table  <dig> while the frequencies are presented in figure  <dig>  the distribution of exon  <dig> allele frequencies was very skewed. three exon  <dig> alleles  accounted for more than 50% of the observations and the vast majority of the homozygosity observed. in contrast,  <dig> exon  <dig> alleles occurred in only  <dig> sheep while  <dig> exon  <dig> alleles were present in just one animal.

the fluorescent signal from the amplified products was readily distinguished from the background. the mean number of positive events in the absence of the snp allele across all primers was only  <dig> ±  <dig>  in contrast, the number of positive events in the presence of the snp allele was  <dig> ±  <dig>  non-specific amplification was readily distinguished from allele-specific amplification by setting a threshold of  <dig> events.

discussion
a multiplex double arms reaction on solid phase  was used to determine the linkage phase of each pair of polymorphic sites and to resolve complex genotypes into constituent haplotypes. essentially this technique determines whether the alleles at two linked snp loci are in a trans or cis relationship. . this approach has the same resolution as allele specific sequencing. in addition, unlike direct sequence based genotyping, it does not require the time-consuming and error prone assignment of alleles from a single polymorphic sequence. however, direct sequencing does have the advantage of identifying novel polymorphic nucleotides but for loci such as the mhc, the vast bulk of the variation is the result of novel combinations of polymorphisms at well-described positions. we have demonstrated that this technique  is capable of identifying such novel exon  <dig> alleles. importantly, both of the novel exon  <dig> alleles have been independently confirmed.

an alternative bead-based method has been developed independently  <cit> . in this procedure, oligonucleotides specific for snp allele are attached to differently-coloured fluorescent beads and use to probe amplicons which have been generated from the test genome. this procedure relies on allele-specific hydridisation and like the double arms procedure described here allows high-throughput determination of snp haplotypes.

arms based techniques can be prone to both false positive  and false negative results . voss addresses these potential problems in a number of ways. each pcr reaction uses at least four specific primers. when the sample is heterozygous at both snp pairs, four positive reaction products are produced. heterozygosity at only one of the pair produces  <dig> reaction products, whereas homozygosity at both members of the pair produces a single product. each snp is tested multiple times within the same reaction. in addition, there is a minimum of two positive fluorescent bead populations for every expected reaction. this inherent quality control greatly aids the confident assignment of haplotype. such built in redundancy might generally be thought to be expensive. however the cost of the fluorescent beads  is in the same order as single sequencing reactions, and with all other reagents and consumables being common to both techniques, trans-cistor compares favorably in economic terms. moreover, it is the potential to automate from pcr set up to haplotype identification that shows the greatest potential advantage.

solid phase pcr has been reported to have an efficiency less than half that of liquid phase  <cit> . we have adopted two strategies to address this. as each reaction is represented in both the liquid and solid phase, there is always a more efficient liquid phase reaction, producing template for the solid phase reaction. additionally, the use of laser detection of fluorescent product on beads, allows detection of extremely small quantities of dna, far less than could be visualized with ethidium bromide stained electrophoresis gels. furthermore, while multiplex pcr reactions are prone to produce many spurious products that cannot be easily identified by electrophoresis, the detection system used here only identifies those products with the expected priming site at each end, eliminating the 'multiplex noise'.

pcr based techniques are always limited by the size of the dna region which can be amplified efficiently and this may be a specific limitation on solid phase pcr. we have tested this by amplifying portions of exon  <dig> of the human clotting factor viii gene. solid phase amplicons up to  <dig> kb could routinely be produced, and amplicons up to  <dig>  kb could be readily produced in multiplex reactions , demonstrating the power of the technique to determine haplotype over extended regions.

the double arms  <cit>  method is a general approach to determining linkage phase of polymorphic markers. trans-cistor offers the ability to automate all the way through to haplotype. its application extends to all uses of haplotype information including linkage analysis for the diagnosis of genetic diseases. population studies on the geographical distribution of haplotypes can be performed without pedigree analysis. haplotype information over extended regions may also be used to study genetic recombination.

the solid phase double arms is a robust method that has been applied to the complex drb <dig> locus in sheep. however, this method could be used routinely for haplotype determination and could have many diagnostic applications. potential applications include genotyping of viral strains in mixed infection, chimaerism following bone marrow or stem cell transplantation, and mapping the boundaries of translocations in malignant cell clones.

the trans-cistor procedure improves the accuracy with which linkage disequilibrium can be estimated. we compared linkage disequilibrium between snp at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  the first method used in individuals whose haplotypes are unknown, uses a composite linkage disequilibrium coefficient  <cit> . in our sample the most common haplotype was aa with a frequency of  <dig>  and a correlation coefficient of  <dig> . in contrast, when the directly determined haplotypes were used the correlation coefficient was  <dig> . as linkage disequilibrium is widely used to identify genetic markers for disease, the ability to obtain correct estimates in unrelated individuals without testing extended families will be invaluable.

CONCLUSIONS
the solid phase double arms approach combines exquisite sensitivity with the specificity to detect a minority dna population. high accuracy results from multiple testing of each snp and the repeated checking of phase against multiple sites.
