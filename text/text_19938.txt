BACKGROUND
phosphorus is an essential mineral nutrient for all organisms, for example, for the biosynthesis of nucleotides such as atp as well as dna and rna, and for the functional regulation of proteins by phosphorylation. however, inorganic phosphate , the only form of phosphorus that can be directly utilized by cells, is often limiting in natural environments where it is frequently present at nanomolar levels  <cit> . in response to pi limitation, the expression of genes for proteins that participate in the uptake and/or in the scavenging of pi is induced under the control of a pi-specific two-component system  <cit> . in escherichia coli, pi uptake is carried out by two kinetically distinct systems: the high affinity phosphate-specific transport  system and the low affinity phosphate-inorganic transport  system, with michaelis-menten  values about  <dig>  μm and  <dig> μm, respectively  <cit> . in e. coli, the high-affinity pst system belongs to the pho regulon and when environmental pi is in excess  the expression of genes of the pho regulon is not induced  <cit> . therefore under pi-replete conditions pi uptake occurs via the pit system.

many cyanobacteria also exhibited different kinetic parameters for pi uptake when grown under pi-limiting conditions than when grown under pi-replete conditions  <cit> . for example, synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig> exhibits a lower km for pi uptake when grown under pi-limiting conditions. this organism contains both low-affinity and high-affinity pi transport systems where the high-affinity pi transport activity is regulated by the periplasmic pi-binding protein sphx  <cit> . in contrast, a low affinity pit-like pi transport system is thought to be absent in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>   <cit> . this cyanobacterium was previously shown to contain two pst systems, pst <dig> and pst <dig>  that are up-regulated in response to pi limitation  <cit> . it is well known that the growth of cyanobacteria relies both on the size of the pool of internal polyphosphate and on their ability to take up pi from the natural environment with fluctuating pi levels  <cit> . it is therefore of interest to investigate the uptake of pi by pst <dig> and pst <dig> of synechocystis  <dig>  in this study we determined the kinetics of each pst system using deletion mutants of each system in synechocystis  <dig>  we demonstrated that pst <dig> was the main pi transporter whereas pst <dig> might play a role in the uptake of pi under low pi environments.

RESULTS
growth of wild type and mutants
the growth of wild-type synechocystis  <dig> was similar to that of the mutants lacking either pst <dig>  or pst <dig>  in bg- <dig> medium . under pi-limiting conditions, the three strains also showed similar growth characteristics during the first two days but later on showed slightly slower growth rates than in bg- <dig> medium. the analysis of total pi content of all three strains showed a small increase of total pi during the first  <dig> h under pi-replete conditions . at  <dig> h, total pi content decreased slightly or remained stable. on the other hand, under pi-limiting conditions the three strains showed a decrease of total pi at  <dig> h and only marginal contents were detected later in growth. in both situations, the total pi content of the three strains was very similar at all time points tested.

pcc  <dig> grown in bg- <dig> under pi-replete conditions for various times

the absorption spectra showed no difference among the three strains when grown in bg- <dig> . likewise, similar spectra were obtained for all strains grown under pi-limiting conditions with the peaks at  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm, corresponding to chlorophyll a, and the peak at  <dig> nm, corresponding to phycobilins, all being reduced .

phosphate uptake
one-day pi-starved synechocystis  <dig> cells showed a linear increase in pi uptake during  <dig> min whereas no apparent uptake was observed in cells under pi-replete conditions . however, the Δpst <dig> mutant showed pi uptake under pi-limiting and pi-replete conditions , but these pi uptake activities by Δpst <dig> cells accounted for only ~10% of that observed for wild-type cells under pi-limiting conditions.. in contrast, the Δpst <dig> mutant showed similar rates of pi uptake to that of wild type .

all strains showed saturation kinetics for the uptake of pi . under pi-limiting conditions, double-reciprocal plots yielded a km of  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm and maximum velocity  of  <dig>  and  <dig>  μmol • - <dig> for wild type and the Δpst <dig> mutant, respectively . the kinetic parameters for both wild type and the Δpst <dig> strains under pi-replete conditions could not be obtained due to their very low uptake capacity. the pi uptake of the Δpst <dig> mutant either under pi-sufficient or pi-limiting conditions appeared to be saturated at very low concentration of pi with a km of  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm and vmax of  <dig>  and  <dig>  μmol • - <dig> under pi-limiting and pi-sufficient conditions, respectively .

effect of light/dark and metabolic inhibitors on phosphate uptake
we demonstrated that the pi uptake activity of wild-type cells was inhibited in the presence of various metabolic inhibitors and under dark incubation . under dark incubation, the presence of the photosystem ii-specific inhibitor 3-- <dig>  1-dimethylurea and kcn, led to an ~50% reduction of pi uptake. moreover, uptake was significantly decreased in the presence of ion-gradient dissipating agents such as, gramicidin, the sodium ionophore, amiloride and valinomycin. strong inhibition was also caused by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone with the remaining activity ~ 25%. the pi uptake was also diminished by n-ethylmaleimide. altogether, these results indicated that the uptake of pi by synechocystis  <dig> is energy-dependent and that an ion gradient is necessary for the uptake.

acells were preincubated with inhibitors for  <dig> min before the addition of k2hpo <dig> to initiate uptake. data are the mean of three experiments ± sd. bcells were preincubated with inhibitors for  <dig> min before assays.

effect of external ph on phosphate uptake
the pi uptake ability of wild-type cells was tested at different ph ranging from ph  <dig> to  <dig> using  <dig> mm of either mes/koh  or hepes/koh  or ethanolamine/koh . the synechocystis  <dig> cells exhibited similar pi uptake activity under broad alkaline conditions ranging from ph  <dig> to  <dig> .

effect of osmolality on phosphate uptake
the pi uptake in many cyanobacteria was shown to be strongly activated by the addition of na+  <cit> . the presence of nacl could generate ionic stress and osmotic stress. to test whether ionic stress or osmotic stress affected pi uptake, experiments were carried out in the presence of various concentrations of nacl and sorbitol or a combination of both with a fixed osmolality equivalent to  <dig> mosmol • kg- <dig>  figure  <dig> shows that nacl stimulated pi uptake whereas sorbitol reduced pi uptake. the osmolality of  <dig> mosmol • kg- <dig> contributed solely by sorbitol caused about 50% reduction in pi uptake. however, increasing the concentration of nacl while keeping the osmolality at  <dig> mosmol • kg- <dig> led to a progressive increase of pi uptake.

discussion
the pst <dig> and pst <dig> operons belonging to the pho regulon in synechocystis  <dig> were shown to be both up-regulated when cells grown in bg- <dig>  were transferred to a pi-free medium  <cit> . these conditions have routinely been used to investigate the pho regulon in cyanobacteria  <cit> . synechocystis  <dig> cells are able to survive under pi-limiting conditions following initial growth in bg- <dig> although photoautotrophic growth and pigment content decreased  <cit> . similarly, the absence of either the pst <dig> or pst <dig> pi-uptake system did not prevent growth, suggesting that the mutants had sufficient pi stored over the course of the measurement  <cit> . this was partly substantiated by the analysis of total pi which showed similar pi content among wild type, Δpst <dig> and Δpst <dig> strains up to  <dig> h growth in both pi-limiting and pi-replete conditions.

our kinetics studies showed that pi uptake characteristic of pst <dig>  was similar to that of wild type whereas pi uptake by pst <dig>  accounted for about 10% of the wild type . this suggested that pst <dig> is the main pi transporter of synechocystis  <dig>  pst <dig> of synechocystis  <dig> contributed very weakly for the uptake of pi despite its higher affinity than that of pst <dig> system. the pst <dig> transporter was taking up pi with similar kinetics when grown either under pi-limiting or pi-replete conditions . this suggested that the expression of pst <dig> was constitutive whereas that of pst <dig> was inducible by pi-limitation . the pst <dig> system might be important when synechocystis cells encounter pi-poor environments. under these environments the absence of pst <dig> might lead to a severe internal pi shortage leading to a strong induction of the expression of the pst <dig> system. the cells can then take up pi at a higher rate to sustain growth under pi-poor environments. on the other hand, even in the presence of pst <dig> , internal pi shortage might also occur since the pi uptake capacity of pst <dig> was relatively low. since the contribution to the uptake of pi by pst <dig> is rather low, the uptake of pi in synechocystis relies mainly on pst <dig> which is considered as a medium/low affinity transporter in comparison to the high affinity transporter of pst <dig> system in e. coli. these observations suggest that e. coli might adjust and survive better than synechocystis under low pi environments. it is likely that some relations exist between the usual pi concentration of a biotope and the km of the pi uptake system of the microorganisms thriving in this biotope.

some evolutionary adaptation might exist between pst <dig> and pst <dig> in synechocystis  <dig> which is advantageous for its survival in environments with fluctuating pi availability. in this respect, it is worth mentioning that the analysis using blastp  <cit>  revealed a low % similarity of amino acid sequences of periplasmic pi-binding proteins belonging to pst <dig> and pst <dig> systems . in contrast, both the transmembrane permease subunits and the cytosolic atp-binding subunits of these pst <dig> and pst <dig> systems shared high % similarity of amino acid sequences spanning from 67% to 84%. this suggested that differences in kinetic properties between pst <dig> and pst <dig> are accounted for mainly by differences in the periplasmic pi-binding protein subunits.

the uptake of pi in response to changes in external ph by synechocystis  <dig> was similar to that by synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig>  <cit> . both cyanobacteria had poor uptake activity at acidic ph. at external ph of  <dig> which is lower than the pk <dig> of phosphoric acid the monovalent species  predominates whereas at external ph of  <dig> almost all pi is in the divalent form   <cit> . the fact that there were no significant differences in pi uptake at ph  <dig> and  <dig>  suggested that the pi uptake system in synechocystis  <dig> can recognize both h2po4- and hpo42-. the ability of synechocystis  <dig> to bind two different pi species is advantageous to its survival especially under fluctuating external ph and low pi availability.

the increased pi uptake activity by nacl is ascribed to an ionic rather than an osmotic effect since an osmotic stress of the same strength achieved with a non-ionic sorbitol caused a reduction in pi uptake . it is possible that the presence of na+ might facilitate the uptake of pi, as in e. coli where it is transported as neutral metal phosphate  <cit> . the driving force for the uptake of pi in synechocystis  <dig> is likely to be atp generated by ion gradient or ion gradient itself. indeed, the effect of the inhibitors tested on this uptake support this hypothesis. the fact that pi uptake is na+-stimulated and that the uptake is favorable at alkaline ph can support this contention.

CONCLUSIONS
synechocystis cells can survive under pi-limiting conditions following initial growth in bg- <dig> medium. the uptake of pi in synechocystis  <dig> is accomplished mainly by pst <dig> despite its lower affinity for pi than that of pst <dig>  the expression of pst <dig> might be useful when cells encounter low pi environments. pi uptake is stimulated by alkaline ph as well as by ionic solute such as nacl whereas it is inhibited by non-ionic solute  generating osmotic stress.
