BACKGROUND
chloroplasts are the plastid organelles responsible for photosynthesis, and their genomes have proven to be a valuable resource for plant phylogenetics, population genetics, species identification and genetic engineering. high-throughput next generation sequencing  technologies have led to a rapid growth in the number of available chloroplast  genomes, including representatives of most major lineages of green plants, viridiplantae  <cit> . the quadripartite structure of the plant cp genome is highly conserved, with an inverted repeat region separating the small and large single repeat regions in most species  <cit> .

molecular phylogenomic studies utilising cp genome sequence data from the genes and slowly-evolving inverted repeat regions have been applied to unravel the deep-level evolutionary relationships of plant taxa  <cit> , producing robust phylogenies that are corroborated by sequence data from mitochondrial and nuclear genomes  <cit> . although cp genome phylogenies have been enormously important in resolving relationships among the flowering plants angiospermae, the position of some lineages remains unresolved. relationships among early-diverging lineages, including basal angiosperms, magnoliidae , monocotyledoneae  and basal eudicotyledoneae  have been among the most problematic due to rapid diversification early in the history of flowering plants  <cit> . increased taxon sampling, particularly for taxa representing deep-level divergences, may provide resolution.  <cit> .

the basal eudicot order proteales contains the families nelumbonaceae, platanaceae and proteaceae  <cit> . fossil evidence and fossil-calibrated molecular dating indicate family-level divergence within the order by the early cretaceous, over  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . there is evidence for long-term morphological and molecular stasis in the nelumbonaceae and platanaceae, and the only extant genera nelumbo and platanus are both regarded as 'living fossils'  <cit> . by contrast, the southern hemisphere family proteaceae is morphologically and ecologically diverse. approximately  <dig> genera and  <dig> species are recognised, including the australian banksia and macadamia and african protea. current distribution is the result of both vicariance during gondwanan breakup and long-distance dispersal  <cit> .

the proteaceae exhibits remarkably variable levels of endemism and species-richness, notably in the mediterranean climate biodiversity hotspots of southwest australia and the cape floristic region  <cit> . it is, therefore, a family of great interest for studies of speciation, diversification, biogeography and evolution  <cit> . however, genomic resources for the proteaceae are limited and little is known of the composition and organisation of the genomes and their evolution. here, as part of an ongoing effort to establish a comprehensive understanding of the macadamia genomes, we present the complete and annotated dna sequence for the chloroplast from macadamia integrifolia, to our knowledge the first in the proteaceae. given that the closest reference sequences of platanus and nelumbo are over  <dig> million years divergent, the macadamia cp genome was assembled de novo at deep coverage.

RESULTS
de novo genome assembly
after trimming for low quality bases and adapter sequences, there were  <dig>  ×  <dig> reads with an average read length of  <dig> base pairs . de novo assembly produced  <dig>  contiguous sequences  with an n <dig> of  <dig> . the maximum and average contig lengths were  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. three chloroplast contigs were identified, with greatest similarity to platanus occidentalis based on total alignment score and percentage sequence identity. these contigs totalled  <dig>  bp in length and corresponded to the large single copy , small single copy  and a double-coverage, collapsed consensus of the inverted repeat regions . they were aligned to the platanus cp genome using mummer as a starting point to order and assemble the draft genome . the single collapsed inverted repeat  contig was separated into two repeat regions. assembly of the two ir and the large single copy  and small single copy  contigs covered the complete sequence without gaps. iterations of assembly, realignment and editing using bwa, mummer and gap <dig> were performed to complete the genome assembly. sanger sequences spanning the inverted repeat and de novo contig junctions confirmed those in the final assembly. reference mapping of paired-end reads was used to determine quality and coverage of the finished macadamia cp genome. following re-assembly of reads, the  <dig>  nucleotide positions of each inverted repeat region were examined for differences and found to be identical. in total,  <dig>  million reads  were mapped. median coverage was  <dig>  times and the minimum coverage of any position was  <dig> 

chloroplast genome of macadamia integrifolia and comparative analyses
the cp genome of m. integrifolia is  <dig>  bp in length with a typical quadripartite structure . the lsc, ssc and ir regions are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp respectively and gc content is  <dig> %. gene content and order is identical in macadamia, platanus and nelumbo with each sharing  <dig> protein-coding,  <dig> trna and  <dig> rrna genes. size differences among proteales cp genomes are primarily due to expansion of the ir and corresponding reductions in the lsc and ssc regions in macadamia relative to platanus and nelumbo. indels are located primarily in noncoding regions with the largest a  <dig>  bp deletion in macadamia relative to platanus in the ndhc to trnv-uac inter-genic spacer . based on internal stop codons, ycf <dig> in the macadamia cp genome is a pseudogene, as in platanus and nelumbo and many other angiosperms. in macadamia ycf <dig> is intact, with an amino acid sequence identical to many other angiosperms including the magnoliid calycanthus floridus. in platanus, ycf <dig> is a pseudogene  <cit> , likely due to a  <dig> bp deletion in the ycf <dig> coding region relative to macadamia . the rps <dig> gene is located at the 3'-end of the ir regions in macadamia and nelumbo, and spans the ira-lsc and lsc-irb junction in platanus only. the presence of acg start codons in ndhd, psbl and rpl <dig> suggests that rna editing is required for translation of these genes in macadamia and platanus.

characterisation of cpssr loci
in total,  <dig> chloroplast simple sequence repeat  regions were identified in macadamia. of these,  <dig> were mononucleotide  and two were dinucleotide  repeats. the majority , were located in noncoding sections of the lsc region. however,  <dig> cpssr are located in exons including two in ycf <dig> replicated in the inverted repeat regions. no tri- or tetranucleotide repeats over  <dig> bp in length were found. of particular interest for population genetics studies are regions of the clpp intron  and trnk to rps <dig> intergenic spacer  containing multiple ssrs as they are co-located in short sections amenable to pcr amplification and sanger sequencing. the  <dig> cpssrs in noncoding regions shared with platanus are also of interest as they are likely to be present and may be variable in other proteaceae species .

phylogenetic analyses
maximum likelihood  analyses were performed on 87-taxa chloroplast gene and 160-taxa ir alignments in order to determine the position of macadamia within angiospermae, and the consequence of its inclusion on inferring phylogenetic relationships among basal eudicots.

chloroplast gene phylogeny
the final 87-taxa and 83-gene alignment used for analyses was  <dig>  bp in length. the proportion of gaps and undetermined characters was  <dig>  %, and gc content was  <dig> %. the optimal partitioning scheme identified under the bayesian information criteria  using relaxed clustering analysis in partitionfinder  contained  <dig> partitions. maximum likelihood analyses under the 49-partition and single partition  strategies and the gtr+Γ model produced identical topologies. the ml 'best' tree with the highest likelihood score  produced by the partitioned ml analysis  shared the same topology as the best tree from unpartitioned analysis .

inverted repeat region phylogeny
the final ir alignment used for analyses was  <dig>  bp in length, including  <dig>  bp  of non-coding sequence from spacers and introns. the proportion of gaps and undetermined characters was  <dig> % and gc content was  <dig> %. the optimal partitioning scheme in partitionfinder  contained  <dig> partitions. maximum likelihood analyses under the 5-partition and unpartitioned strategies with the gtr+Γ model produced identical topologies. the ml 'best' tree  produced by the partitioned analysis  shared the same topology as the best tree from unpartitioned analysis .

phylogenetic analyses based on both chloroplast genes and inverted repeat regions provided maximum bootstrap  support for a sister relationship between macadamia and platanus, and for a proteales clade also containing nelumbo . sabiaceae  was sister to the proteales in all analyses, however, the level of support for this clade was lower in the ir  compared to the 83-gene  partitioned analyses . the 83-gene and ir phylogenies were highly congruent, with the only differences among basal eudicot taxa in the position of buxus and trochodendron. in the 83-gene phylogeny, support for a buxus versus trochondendron sister relationship to the core eudicots was marginal , whereas trochodendron was sister to the core eudicots  in the partitioned  and unpartitioned  ir analyses respectively. the main topological difference among core eudicots was in the position of the three major clades: superrosids, superasterids and dilleniaceae. in cp-gene phylogenies, dillenia was sister to the superrosids  and in ir phylogenies dillenaceae was sister to the superosids+superasterids .

discussion
characteristics of the macadamia cp genome and comparison to other angiosperms
the chloroplast genome of macadamia integrifolia cultivar haes  <dig> was sequenced at deep coverage  and assembled de novo using illumina ngs reads. structure, gene content and order appear to be highly conserved in the basal eudicot order proteales, and in comparision to the inferred ancestral cp genome organization of nicotiana tabacum and many other angiosperms  <cit> . consistently high levels of conservation within angiospermae are indicative of evolutionary constraints on the cp genome of photosynthetic plants  <cit> . major differences among angiosperm cp genomes are due to gene losses, inversions and expansion/contraction of inverted repeat regions. gene loss in parasitic plants can lead to markedly reduced cp genome size. for example, the cp genome of the underground orchid rhizanthella gardneri is only  <dig> kb  <cit>  and there may have been a complete loss of the plastid genome in rafflesia lagascae  <cit> . gene loss can also be due to the transfer of cp genes to the nuclear genome  <cit> . gene order is largely conserved among angiosperms including macadamia and other basal eudicots, however, large inversions altering gene order have been reported in some core eudicot species . the main effects of expansion and contraction of the ir regions at the lsc and ssc junctions are the formation of pseudogenes, and changes in genome size and evolutionary rate  <cit> . the smaller cp genome of macadamia compared to platanus and nelumbo is primarily due to relative reduction of the single copy regions, with most deletions in intergenic spacers and introns. the macadamia ir at  <dig>  kb is the largest yet reported in the proteales but is considerably smaller than those of the basal eudicot trochondendron  and the core eudicot pelargonium x hortorum,   <cit> . proteales cp genomes also differ in the complement of pseudogenes. the intact ycf <dig> gene of macadamia is, in platanus a pseudogene due to a large deletion. the function and validity of ycf <dig> are uncertain, and there is no evidence of chloroplast-nuclear gene transfer in angiosperms with intact or disabled ycf <dig> genes  <cit> . the rps <dig> gene spans the ira-lsc junction causing an pseudogene in the irb of platanus.

phylogenetic implications and the position of proteaceae
australia is the origin and centre of diversity of the proteaceae, and this morphologically distinct and diverse family is distributed across remnant landmasses of the southern supercontinent gondwana  <cit> . the order proteales inclusive of proteaceae, platanaceae and nelumbonaceae was established relatively recently, on the basis of molecular data, and morphological synapomorphies for the order are yet to be identified  <cit> .

the  <dig> cp gene and ir region alignments used in this study are the largest sequence-rich datasets to include the basal eudicot family proteaceae. maximum likelihood phylogenies confirmed the position of macadamia within the proteales, and were congruent and largely concordant with recent phlyogenomic studies  <cit> . there was maximum support for a sister relationship between proteaceae and platanaceae, and for a proteales clade containing these families and nelumbonaceae. a 640-taxa angiosperm phylogeny using  <dig> genes from all three plant genomes included the proteaceae taxa petrophile and roupala  <cit> , and a 57-taxa,  <dig> kb alignment of chloroplast introns, spacers and genes included embothrium and grevillea  <cit> . both studies confirmed inclusion of proteaceae in the proteales , in accordance with the angiosperm phylogeny group iii system  <cit> . in this study, a clade containing sabiaceae  and proteales was recovered from both the 83-gene and ir analyses with moderate support . these results are consistent with those from previous phylogenomic studies with support values ranging from 43-88%, although a proteales-sabiaceae clade was not recovered in all analyses  <cit> .

the inclusion of macadamia in taxon-rich chloroplast gene and inverted repeat alignments produced largely congruent and well-supported ml phylogenies. the main topological differences were in the positions of taxa representing lineages that are unplaced in the apg iii system including dillenia, trochodendron and buxus  <cit> . within core eudicots, there was conflicting strong support for a sister relationship between  dillenia and superrosids, and  dillenaceae, represented by  <dig> genera, and superosids+superasterids, in cp-gene and ir analyses respectively. there was strong support for trochodendron as sister to core eudicots in ir analyses, whilst the core eudicot sister was undetermined between trochodendron and buxus in cp-gene analyses . interestingly, previous studies provided strong support for a buxaceae-core eudicot clade based on data from the cp, mitochondrial and nuclear genes  <cit>  and for an alternative trochodendron-core eudicot clade using the cp ir region. efforts to resolve relationships among unplaced angiosperm lineages, are hampered by short internal branch lengths due to rapid divergence of major lineages in the cretaceous  <cit> . full resolution of relationships among basal eudicots may require denser sampling of both taxa and genes.

utility of the macadamia chloroplast genome
problems in identfying a single locus dna barcode for plants, and advances in sequencing technologies have led to suggestions that the cp genome could have utility in species identification  <cit> . possible obstacles include the cost and complexity of assembly  <cit> . however, the advantages of using a ngs approach to chloroplast dna barcoding include the potential to eliminate pcr and hence reliance on 'universal' primers. given the widely reported transfer of chloroplast sequence to the nuclear genome  <cit>  avoidance of pcr further eliminates the risk of amplifying paralogous nuclear plastid-like sequences . the availability of high quality cp genomes for representatives of each of the  <dig> recognised angiosperm families should facilitate species identification. this can be achieved through rapid identification of cp sequences by reference mapping of low coverage ngs reads at multiple locations, without the requirement for complete genome assembly. continual improvements in sequencing technologies, including increased read lengths and decreasing cost, in addition to new methods to optimise recovery of chloroplast sequences from plant dna  <cit>  are bringing cp genome-wide barcoding closer to reality.

whole chloroplast genome sequencing enables identification of intraspecific variation for phylogeographic studies, even in genetically depauperate species  <cit>  and cpssr regions have been widely used in population genetics  <cit> . the  <dig> macadamia cpssr identified in this study may provide markers with broad utility across proteaceae species. the macadamia cp genome is currently providing a reference sequence for inferring the domestication and evolutionary histories of macadamia . furthermore, it will be of benefit for taxon-rich phylogenomic studies and understanding of the evolution and adaptations underlying the remarkable diversity of this large southern hemisphere plant family  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the complete chloroplast genome of macadamia integrifolia was assembled de novo from illumina ngs reads, and provides the first reference genome sequence for the gondwanan plant family, proteaceae. despite sequencing at deep coverage  the genome was recovered in three contigs, one of which corresponded to a collapsed copy of the inverted repeat regions. although genome assembly from these contigs was straightforward, this provides an illustration of the problems that large repeat regions present to de novo genome assembly from ngs short read sequence data. phylogenetic analyses of both 83-gene and inverted repeat region alignments confirmed the position of proteaceae in the order proteales, with maximum support for a sister relationship between platanaceae  and proteaceae . the macadamia chloroplast genome provides a high-quality reference for future evolutionary studies within the proteaceae and will be of benefit for taxon-rich phylogenomic analyses aiming to resolve relationships among early-diverging angiosperms and more broadly across the plant tree of life.
