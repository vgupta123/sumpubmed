BACKGROUND
genetic disease resistance is an effective tool for sustainable management of late blight, caused by phytophthora infestans, which is economically the most important disease of potato. breeding at the beginning of the twentieth century concentrated on major dominant late blight resistance  genes from the mexican wild species solanum demissum and eleven of these r genes were introgressed in potato  <cit> . however, rapid breakdown of resistance in potato varieties containing s. demissum r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig> <cit>  has sparked an increased focus on the introgression of multiple broad spectrum r genes in order to impart durability to commercial varieties. it has turned out in various crops and pathosystems that stacking of multiple r genes is necessary to provide satisfactory resistance in the field  <cit> . although the used r genes provide resistance to broad spectra of late blight strains, the predominant agricultural deployment of only one r gene can drive the evolution of new virulent strains. in the absence of chemical controls this might even result in the destruction of an entire harvest  <cit> . therefore, the use of combinations of r genes with different spectra must be pursued to increase durability of resistance and thereby providing food security under no or little fungicide application. r gene stacking might be achieved by genetic crossings but the desired variety characteristics will never be fully recovered due to the high level of heterozygosity in potato. sarpo mira is an example of a durably late blight resistant potato variety which contains a stack of at least four r genes  <cit> . unfortunately, the variety has not acquired a large market share yet because established varieties are preferred by farmers, processors and consumers.

addition of stacks of cloned r genes  <cit>  to existing varieties  through genetic modification  technology is therefore an attractive alternative. moreover, gm technology circumvents the problem of linkage drag and can speed up the introgression of the r gene  <cit> . gm technology has, however, met various types of opposition and a major point of criticism concerns the introduction of “foreign” genes into the food chain and environment. however, within the framework provided by cisgenesis only natural genes from the same or crossable species are used  <cit> . cisgenes are, therefore, already present in the natural gene pool of the crop plant and cisgenesis only facilitates their introduction into crops. indeed a majority of a broad panel of european consumers find cisgenic apples safe and not harmfull for the environment  <cit> .

recently, the transformation of three broad spectrum potato late blight resistance genes  was described in potato  <cit> . rpi-sto <dig>  rpi-vnt <dig>  and rpi-blb <dig> are native genes from crossable species and are therefore considered as cisgenes for potato. however, the plants in the study from zhu et al.  <cit>  are “transgenic” as the selectable marker gene, nptii, was of bacterial origin. also beyond the cisgenesis framework it is not desired to introduce antibiotic resistance genes into the environment and in this study, we established a pipeline for agrobacterium-mediated transformation of potato in the absence of a selectable marker gene . after the absence of vector backbone integration was confirmed, these potatoes were designated as “cisgenic” because of the absence of any foreign  genes. this is the first scientific report on the production and functional evaluation of cisgenic r gene stacking in different potato varieties.

RESULTS
transformation and functional expression of single late blight r genes in potato varieties
the resistance spectra of three potato varieties  were tested with five p. infestans isolates with variable virulence spectra and aggressiveness. atlantic and bintje were susceptible to all tested isolates while potae <dig> was resistant to two isolates . these two isolates are a-virulent on plants carrying r <dig> type of resistance genes. the presence of r <dig> or a functional homolog in potae <dig> was confirmed using avr <dig> response experiments . in order to make atlantic and bintje resistant to late blight and to broaden the resistance spectrum of potae <dig>  these three varieties were transformed with two constructs , each containing a single late blight r gene . the transgenic events were collected using selection for kanamycin resistance and, successively, the functional expression of the introduced r genes was tested using agroinfiltration of the cognate a-virulence  genes. also the transgenic events were subjected to p. infestans inoculation using a detached leaf assay . as an example, the interactions of a representative set of transgenic events with the selected isolates are shown in figure  <dig>  as expected, the majority of the transgenic events showed resistance to at least four of the five tested p. infestans isolates. ec <dig> and pic <dig> were described previously to break the rpi-vnt <dig>  and rpi-sto <dig> mediated resistances, respectively  <cit> . indeed, transgenic atlantic and bintje events harbouring the rpi-vnt <dig>  gene were susceptible to isolate ec <dig>  the potae <dig> transgenic events containing rpi-vnt <dig>  were resistant to ec <dig>  due to the presence of r <dig> or a functional homolog in potae <dig>  the rpi-sto1-containing events were susceptible to isolate pic <dig>  it is concluded that both rpi-vnt <dig>  and rpi-sto <dig> were able to confer resistance in the selected varieties and these two genes may, therefore, be combined as a cisgenic r gene stack in the selected varieties.

selection and validation of cisgenic potato plants with two late blight r genes
cisgenesis excludes antibiotic resistance marker-assisted transformation since the genes encoding the selection markers are derived from non-crossable species. we, therefore, pursued marker-free transformation of the cisgenes rpi-vnt <dig>  and rpi-sto <dig> in combination with pcr selection . two hundred stem explants from each of the three selected varieties were prepared and co-cultivated with an a. tumefaciens strain carrying only the cisgenic late blight r genes rpi-vnt <dig>  and rpi-sto <dig> between the t-dna borders of a binary plasmid . between  <dig> and -110 days after transformation, over  <dig> shoots were collected in five rounds of harvesting . during the experiment, the shoot regeneration potential of the callus gradually dropped and at 130 days after transformation no more shoots could be harvested. these  <dig> shoots were screened by pcr with rpi-vnt <dig> and rpi-sto <dig> primers and  <dig> pcr positive shoots were selected . all pcr positive shoots were originating from different explants, indicating that they were independent transformation events. two bintje events only contained the rpi-vnt <dig> gene and were discarded. the remaining  <dig> events, containing both rpi-vnt <dig> and rpi-sto <dig>  were further tested using vector backbone gene-specific pcr analysis . we found that six events contained vector backbone sequences . the remaining  <dig> events were vector backbone free and are therefore designated as cisgenic events. the  <dig> cisgenic events were transferred to the greenhouse for phenotypic characterisation. three weeks after transfer to the greenhouse, five events displayed abnormal plant morphology that consisted of curly leaves and dwarfed growth , a phenomenon that is commonly observed after regeneration  <cit> . the five events with these aberrant phenotypes were disregarded for further studies and the remaining  <dig> events were tested for their responsiveness to avrvnt <dig> and avrsto <dig> after agroinfiltration. five events responded only to avrvnt <dig> and not to avrsto <dig>  eight events responded to both avrvnt <dig> and avrsto <dig> infiltration, showing that both rpi-vnt <dig> and rpi-sto <dig> were functionally expressed . the latter eight plants also displayed resistance in dla to all p. infestans isolates tested. figure  <dig> shows an example of the validation of functional expression for both transferred r genes in event h43- <dig>  by agroinfiltration and resistance assays in the dla. using the single gene-containing transgenic plants as reference it was demonstrated that stacking of r genes with different resistance spectra leads to complementary broad spectrum resistance . interestingly, the two introduced r genes are complementing the resistance spectrum that was already present in potae <dig> plants. using the pursued experimental setup we were able to select two cisgenic events in atlantic, five cisgenic events in bintje and one cisgenic event in potae <dig> containing and functionally expressing a stack of two late blight r genes.

comparison of marker-assisted- and marker-free transformation efficiencies
kanamycin resistance assisted selection is routinely used for plant transformation. it is, therefore, interesting to compare the efficiency of marker-free transformation in the cisgenesis pipeline to marker-assisted transformation. marker-assisted transformation efficiency was 100% when expressed as the percentage of rooting shoots being pcr positive for the gene of interest . in this definition, marker-free transformation efficiency ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> % over the three varieties.

for a better comparison of marker-assisted and marker-free transformation, it was essential to use a different definition for transformation efficiency that also takes shoot regeneration efficiency into account. we define marker-assisted transformation frequency as the percentage of pcr positive events among the number of explants used for transformation. marker-free transformation frequency is defined as the percentage of shoots that is pcr positive. in variety atlantic a high marker-assisted transformation frequency  was observed whereas the other two varieties, bintje and potae <dig>  had significantly lower marker-assisted transformation frequencies  . in marker-free transformation, variety dependent differences in transformation frequencies were less dramatic  and statistically insignificant . not only the frequency of transformation, also the timing of transformation was different between marker-free and marker-assisted transformation. in the marker-free transformation experiments, the majority of the pcr-positive shoots was obtained between  <dig> and 3 months after co-cultivation . this was quicker than marker-assisted transformation of the rpi-vnt <dig> and rpi-sto <dig> genes individually, which took 2- <dig> months . finally, we compared vector backbone integration frequencies among the different marker-free and marker-assisted transformation experiments. we did not find significant differences in vector backbone integrations frequency when the different varieties or both of the marker-assisted transformation constructs were compared . only when vector backbone integration frequency was compared between the marker-free  and marker-assisted transformation experiments  we found that marker-free transformation was associated with less vector backbone integration.

transformation frequencies in marker-free transformations  are derived from the number of transformed shoots  and the total number of shoots minus the number of transformed shoots . transformation frequencies in marker-assisted transformations  are derived from the number of rooting shoots  and the number of explants used minus the number of rooting shoots .

discussion
cisgenesis, is a new approach for traditional plant breeding that uses genetic modification technology to introduce natural genes from within a plant species or from crossable plant species, into varieties  <cit> . therefore, any gene “alien” to the breeder’s gene pool can be avoided in the end product which is causal to many environmental and consumers’ concerns about gm food crops  <cit> . not only can widely used susceptible varieties, like bintje and atlantic, be converted into resistant varieties, also resistant varieties, like potae <dig>  can be complemented with additional resistance genes to avoid or delay future resistance breakdown. in order to complement existing varieties with stacks of cisgenic r genes, two choices must be made:  <dig>  the method to introduce the r gene stack and  <dig>  the method to exclude sequences of foreign origin from transformation events. with respect to the introduction method, in this study we chose transformation by marker-free binary vectors and subsequent regeneration in medium without selective antibiotics followed by pcr-based selection of transformation events  <cit> . alternatives involving the removal of a selectable marker gene by site specific recombination pose disadvantages because of remnant sequences of foreign origin  <cit> .

the average marker-free transformation frequency was  <dig> % and seems to be genotype independent. in a previous marker-free transformation study in potato  <cit>  a t-dna of 6 kb was transformed with a frequency of  <dig> % when a. tumefaciens strain agl <dig> was used, and  <dig> % when a. tumefaciens strain lb <dig> was used. it can not be concluded that agl1 + virg, which was used in this study, was less efficient in transferring the t-dna than agl <dig> in the study from de vetten et al.  <cit> . from unpublished experiments in our laboratory it is known that regeneration time increases with the size of the t-dna. we, therefore, assume that the lower transformation frequency in our study is rather related to the larger t-dna size  of the rpi-vnt1:rpi-sto <dig> construct. therefore, for stacking of more than two genes in cisgenic transformation, the effect of an increased insert size  on transformation frequency remains to be tested. it is known that marker-assisted transformation frequency is highly genotype dependent in potato  <cit> . also here we found that transformation frequencies ranged from 10-71% in different varieties . this variation was remarkably less  in marker-free transformation experiments . it must be noted that transformation frequencies can vary between different experiments and that we here only performed a limited number of experiments. however, the currently presented experiments show that marker-free transformation is less prone to varietal differences than marker assisted transformation. this could be caused by differences in antibiotic tolerance between the varieties that provides transformed cells different abilities to develop into a shoot.

in terms of vector backbone integration, marker-free transformation apparently produces a lower percentage  of vector backbone integrations compared to marker-assisted transformation . again, the number of experiments is limited and firm conclusions cannot be drawn. the vector backbone and border sequences in pbinplus and pbinaw <dig> are highly similar and we do not expect that these differences affect vector backbone integration. a potential explanation could be that the presence of the nptii gene directly next to the left border of the t-dna would stimulate selection of higher levels of backbone integration. as it is known that left border recognition is inaccurate in solanaceae,  <cit> , especially when agrobacterium strain agl <dig> is used  <cit> , positioning of nptii near the left border would force the integration of the complete t-dna. so, it might also lead to higher levels of vector backbone integration. in marker-free transformation, six plants out of  <dig> tested cisgenic plants did not appropriately express rpi-sto <dig> as observed using agroinfiltration of the corresponding avr genes . an obvious explanation could be that t-dna insertion did not proceed all the way to the left border resulting in 3′ truncations of rpi-sto <dig>  these non-functional cisgenic events and the corresponding dna samples were discarded in an early phase during the selection and, unfortunately, this hypothesis could not be confirmed. we observed and described some cisgenic plants differing morphologically from wild type varieties in the greenhouse . this is a generally observed phenomenon and in tissue culture-based breeding schemes it should be considered that aberrant plant phenotypes must be selected against  <cit> .

according to the established experimental scheme, it takes less than one year to obtain potato plants with cisgenic r gene stacks from the r gene construct preparation to the functional validation of the resulting cisgenic plants by performing dlas. as 2- <dig> shoots per explant can be collected and  <dig> independent transformed plants are required considering backbone integration and expression, it is recommended that between 1000- <dig> explants are to be treated in a marker-free-transformation experiment of potato. the efficiency of pcr analysis can be improved by a factor  <dig> by pooling ten shoots, so that the labour intensity of the selection of marker-free transformation events is considered reasonable as compared to the marker-assisted transformations. considering 2- <dig> years’ field trials, it takes totally 3- <dig> years to produce late blight resistant cisgenic events in established potato varieties, which can be released for seed tuber multiplication. this time span is remarkably short compared to the conventional breeding scheme. the cisgenic potatoes selected in this study will be further tested for several years to evaluate whether the transferred r genes are stably expressed over many vegetative cycles. chimeras and epigenetic silencing are issues that could affect stability of resistance. also agronomic performance needs to be assessed and confirmed in multiple growing seasons.

CONCLUSIONS
we have set up and pursued an effective cisgenic marker-free transformation strategy for commercial potato varieties. it was found that marker-free transformation frequency was much less genotype dependent than marker-assisted transformation. also the frequency of vector backbone integration tended to be lower in the marker-free transformations as compared to the marker-assisted transformations. the susceptibility or the narrow late blight resistance spectra of the selected varieties were upgraded to broad spectrum resistance after the successful introduction of two cisgenic late blight r genes. according to the recent conclusion of the european food safety authority gmo panel, cisgenic plants have a risk level similar to conventionally bred plants  <cit> . the cisgenic potatoes, generated in this study, will offer a safe, environmentally friendly, alternative to the current agricultural practice which is highly dependent on the use of chemical late blight control agents. for developing countries, where chemical control agents are unaffordable, cisgenic upgrades of local potato varieties might even ensure food security.
