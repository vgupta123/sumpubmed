BACKGROUND
fruit ripening is a complex, genetically programmed processes involving marked changes in the color, flavor, aroma, texture, and nutritional content of the fruit  <cit> . many advances in our understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms involved in fruit ripening have been achieved in the model fruit tomato through the studies of various ripening-related mutants. these mutants include ripening inhibitor , nonripening , colourless nonripening , green ripe , and never ripe and transcription factors such as tomatoagamous-like  <dig> , ap2a, ethylene response factor  <dig>  and fruitfull  <dig>   <cit> . banana , a typical climacteric fruit, is one of the most important fruit crops in tropical and subtropical countries with a high nutritional value for human health. it comprises an important part in the diet of millions of people around the world. usually, bananas are harvested at 80 % plump stage, and ripening treatment is necessary before the fruit can be eaten. however, the climacteric characteristic of the banana fruit results in a very short shelf life at ambient temperature  <cit> . it is therefore important to clarify the molecular mechanisms of the ripening process. some genes involved in the ethylene biosynthesis and perception pathways have been identified in the banana fruit, such as 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid  synthase, acc oxidase, the ethylene receptor and the ctr <dig> orthologous genes  <cit> . recent reports show that several transcription factors exhibit regulatory roles during banana ripening, including mads-box, ethylene insensitive 3-like , nac, erf, lbd and bsd . however, the other molecular pathways of fruit ripening regulation, such as the mirna regulation pathways, are largely unknown.

micrornas  are class of important non-coding regulatory small rnas  that mediate gene expression at post-transcriptional and translation levels by degrading target mrnas or repressing gene translation  <cit> . great advances have been made in understanding mirna function in various plant species. previous research has shown that mirnas are involved in various metabolic and biological processes in plants, including development, signaling, abiotic stress and regulation of symbiotic relationships  <cit> . recently, many studies have suggested that mirnas play an important role in regulating development and ripening of fruit . for instance, silva et al.  experimentally reported that over-expression of an atmir156b precursor generated abnormal flower and fruit morphologies in tomatoes by affecting the expression of genes associated with meristem maintenance and the formation of new organs  <cit> . mir156/ <dig> and mir <dig> could affect the ripening process of tomatoes by modulating the known ripening regulators cnr and siap2a  <cit> . currently, due to the development of high-throughput sequencing technology, thousands of mirnas from different plant species have been identified and registered in the mirbase <dig>  database .

in bananas, small rnas  have been annotated based on the ‘pahang’ a genome sequence similarities with known mirnas in other species using bioinformatic methods  <cit> . moreover, recently, wen et al.  identified  <dig> pre-mirnas and  <dig> mature mirnas from triploid edible banana leaves with high-throughput sequencing methods  <cit> . however, the mirnas closely involved in the banana fruit ripening process remain unknown. in this study, we investigated the mirna profiles of banana fruits after ethylene and 1-mcp treatment using an illumina hiseq  <dig> platform. the differentially expressed mirnas involved in fruit ripening were identified, and the corresponding target genes were predicted. subsequently, the potential functions of the differentially expressed mirnas and their target genes were discussed. in addition, the expression patterns of several mirnas and their target genes were examined by qrt-pcr methods. this is the first study to prove that mirnas are widely involved in regulating the ethylene-induced ripening process of banana fruit. these data provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of banana fruit ripening.

RESULTS
small rna revealed by high-throughput sequencing in the banana fruit
the plant hormone ethylene plays a key regulatory role in climacteric fruit ripening, which triggers marked changes in fruit flesh color, texture, flavor, and aroma  <cit> . 1-methylcyclopropene , a receptor-binding antagonist of ethylene, blocks the effects of ethylene and is used commercially to slow fruit ripening  <cit> . to identify mirnas involved in the banana fruit ripening process. we treated the banana fruit with ethylene or 1-mcp. the color, firmness and ethylene production of banan fruit have remarkably changed in day  <dig>  no apparent changes were observed in 1-mcp treated fruit . meanwhile, three srna libraries were constructed from banana fruit treated with ethylene or 1-mcp or before treatment  and then sequenced on an illumina hiseq <dig>  which produced  <dig> , <dig> raw reads,  <dig> , <dig> raw reads, and  <dig> , <dig> raw reads, respectively. after removing the low-quality reads, the poly a/t/g/c reads, the adaptor reads and the n% > 10 % reads, an average of  <dig>  % of the total reads remained. there were  <dig> , <dig> clean reads,  <dig> , <dig> clean reads and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads for the control group, the ethylene treatment group, and the 1-mcp treatment group, respectively . a total of  <dig> , <dig> ,  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  sequences were successfully mapped to the banana reference genome . there were an average of  <dig>  reads identified as putative known mirnas and an average of  <dig>  identified as novel mirnas .table  <dig> the results of srna sequences from three banana libraries

for further analysis, the number of small rna sequences with 18–40 nt was counted . in the control and ethylene treatment libraries, the 23 nt size class was the most abundant class of srnas, followed by the 20 nt, 22 nt, and 21 nt size class populations . these results differ from those of medicago truncatula  <cit> , maize  <cit> , potato  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , citrus trifoliate  <cit> , citrus sativus  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> , and rice  <cit> , which all suggest that the most abundant small rna length is 24 nt, and also differ from those of wheat, chinese yew and grapevine , which demonstrated an srna length of 21 nt to be the most abundant. moreover, in recent studies the enrichment of 22 nt was observed in the size distribution of sugarcane  <cit>  and cucumber  <cit>  srnas. this atypical situation of our data draws a parallel with the high number of 23 nt size class population in cucumber  in response to cucumber green mottle mosaic virus infection  <cit> . in addition, the mirna results from bananas leaf indicated that the most abundant small rna length is 21 nt, followed by 24 nt, 22 nt and 20 nt  <cit> , implying a tissue-specific expression of small rnas in banana species. indeed, a recent report experimentally showed that the same mirnas in different banana tissues exhibit differences in expression levels  <cit> . recent study shows that 22 nt class srnas exhibit tissue-specific expression in sugarcane leaf tissue  <cit> . however, in the 1-mcp treatment libraries, the most abundant class of srnas is 21 nt srnas, followed by the 20 nt and 24 nt size class populations . one possibility is that the srna populations could have been influenced under 1-mcp treatment in banana fruit.fig.  <dig> length comparison of small rnas from different treated banana fruit. ck, et and 1-mcp stand for sample without any treatment; sample treated with ethylene and sample treated with 1-mcp  respectively. y-axis represents the numbers of small rna identified in this study. x-axis represents the length of small rna. the length of the deep sequencing results were mainly between  <dig> and 24 nt. the number of 23 nt sequences is greater than the number of other sequence lengths in the control and the et libraries. however, in the 1-mcp library, 21 nt sequences were the most abundant small rnas



overall, these results suggest the existence of a specific, complex and diverse srna population and abiotic factors could affect the proportion of srnas of different length in the banana fruit. moreover, except for the 24 nt srnas, all of the other examined srna classes exhibited strong induction after ethylene treatment, and showed a sharp reduction after 1-mcp treatment , suggesting an important role for mirna in the ethylene-induced ripening process of banana.

identification of known mirnas in banana fruits
to identify the known mirnas in banana fruits, small rna sequences were mapped to the known mature plant mirnas from the mirbase database. after blastn searches and further sequence analysis, a total of  <dig> known mirnas were identified , which belonged to  <dig> mirna families . among these mirnas,  <dig> known mirnas  were detected in all three libraries, while  <dig> mirnas were shared in at least two of three mirnas libraries, implying a relatively stable component of mirnas in banana fruit ripening . in this study,  <dig> conserved mirna families were confirmed ; mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> were the largest represented families with nine members, followed by mir <dig> and mir <dig>  with seven and six members, respectively. of the remaining  <dig> mirna families,  <dig> comprised two to four members, and the others had only one member . in previous research,  <dig> potential mirnas belong to  <dig> mirna families were identified and validated using bioinformatic methods in banana  <cit> . with the exception of mir <dig>  all of the other previously identified mirna families were found in this study. similar to the tomato fruit  <cit> , mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were highly represented among the mirna families. this differs from the japanese apricot  <cit> , pear  <cit> , and peanut  <cit> , which all found that mir <dig> was the largest mirna family of the identified mirna families. these results imply a conservation of mir <dig> across various species. in addition,  <dig> known mirna sequences, belonging to  <dig> non-conserved mirna families, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  were previously identified from one or few plants species and were expressed at very low levels .table  <dig> summary information of known mirna families and their transcript abundance identified in all libraries

among the conserved mirna families , mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were expressed at relatively high levels in all three libraries, which was consistent with previous reports from the tomato fruit  <cit> . these results suggested mirnas are potentially important regulators of the fruit ripening process. moreover, when the expression levels of known mirna families under different treatments were analyzed, the expression levels of several mirna families, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  showed high induction after ethylene treatment and inhibition after 1-mcp treatment . these effects imply an important role of these mirna families during the banana fruit ripening process. in addition, various members within the same family showed variable expression levels. for instance, in the ethylene treatment library, the number of mir <dig> family member reads ranged from 1– <dig> , and the mir <dig> family  and the mir <dig> family  also exhibited variable read numbers. the expression patterns of the same mirna family member within three libraries showed an increase after ethylene treatment and a decrease after 1-mcp treatment, suggesting the important regulatory role of these mirnas in the ethylene-induced ripening process of banana .

identification of novel mirnas in the banana fruit
based on the plant mirna annotation criteria  <cit> , the formation of a stable hairpin structure is the primary criterion of an mirna. in total,  <dig> potential novel mirnas were predicted from the three libraries . in this study, the length of these  <dig> potential novel mirna precursors ranged from 46–291 nt, which was close to the length of mirna precursors in radishes   <cit> . the stem loop structures of these predicted mirna precursors are shown in additional file  <dig>  except for mac-nmir <dig> and mac-nmir <dig>  the minimum free energy  folding value of these mirna precursors ranged from − <dig>  kcal/mol to − <dig>  kcal/mol, with an average of  <dig>  kcal/mol, which was consistent with the previously published low mfe characteristics of mirna  <cit>  and similar to the published sequencing data for pear mirna precursors   <cit>  and radish mirna precursors   <cit> . fifteen of the  <dig> novel mirnas candidates were shared by all three libraries, and  <dig> predicted mirnas candidates existed in both the control and the ethylene treatment libraries, but only  <dig> out of the  <dig> novel mirna candidates existed in the 1-mcp treatment library. in addition, meyers et al.  reported the existence of complementary sequences increases the authenticity of predicted novel mirnas  <cit> . in our study,  <dig> of the  <dig> novel mirnas have complementary mirnas. moreover, all of the novel complementary mirnas exhibited lower expression levels than the corresponding mature mirnas , which might be due to the rapid degradation of complementary strands during the biogenesis of mature mirnas  <cit> .

differentially expressed mirnas of banana in response to ethylene or 1-mcp treatment
to determine the relationship between ethylene and mirnas expression, exogenous ethylene and 1-mcp  were used to treat mature green fruit. expression analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed mirnas of the banana fruit response to ethylene or 1-mcp after three days of storage. based on the selected criteria ,  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified as differentially expressed mirnas . two comparisons were analyzed, et/1-mcp, and et/ck. the differentially expressed mirnas were divided into three groups according to their expression patterns . the results show that  <dig> mirnas were up-regulated in both comparisons, and the expression of  <dig> mirnas was increased after ethylene treatment, including mac-mir172d, mac-mir172e- <dig>  and mac-mir171k-3p. when compared with the 1-mcp treatment library,  <dig> mirnas were up-regulated in the ethylene treatment library, suggesting that the 1-mcp ethylene antagonist affects the expression of some mirnas. in contrast,  <dig> mirnas were down-regulated in both comparisons. the expression of  <dig> mirnas was decreased after ethylene treatment, including mac-mir156z. when compared with the 1-mcp treatment library,  <dig> mirnas were down-regulated in the ethylene treatment library . among the  <dig> conserved mirna families,  <dig> and three mirna families were either up- or down-regulated, respectively, after ethylene treatment when compared with the control group . when compared with the 1-mcp treatment,  <dig> and four mirna families were up-and down-regulated after ethylene treatment, respectively . these results indicate that these mirnas might play important regulatory roles in ethylene-induced ripening of the banana fruit. in addition, previous studies have shown that several known mirna families, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  were up-regulated after ethylene treatment in the tomato fruit  <cit> , which is consistent with the results of this study . moreover, several mirna families  were reported to be down-regulated in tomatoes after 6 h of ethylene treatment  <cit> , while in this study, these mirnas exhibited increased expression after 3 days of ethylene treatment in bananas. these differences might be because these mirnas exhibit a dynamic expression in different time-points after ethylene treatment.fig.  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas under two comparisons  in banana fruit. the bar represents the scale of relative mirna expression . the bottom left shows the color bar. the heatmap was generated by heml  <dig>

identification and classification of differentially expressed mirnas targets
most mirna targets that are conserved in different plant species also have mirna families with multiple target sites, suggesting that these mirnas are functionally divergent. to further clarify the biological functions of the differentially expressed mirnas in ethylene-induced ripening of bananas, we analyzed the target genes of  <dig> mirnas with differential expression after ethylene treatment when compared with 1-mcp treatment. a total of  <dig> target genes for the  <dig> mirnas were predicted. among them,  <dig> and  <dig> target genes were predicted for  <dig> known and five novel up-regulated mirnas, respectively , and  <dig> and  <dig> target genes were predicted for  <dig> known and three novel down-regulated mirnas, respectively . within these results, a single mirna targeted multiple genes and multiple mirnas regulated a single gene, suggesting the functional divergence of these mirnas. as shown in fig.  <dig>   <dig> differentially expressed mirnas targeted four to  <dig> genes. eight mirnas had only one target gene, which may suggest unique regulatory functions. meanwhile, we found that four mirnas targeted to 40– <dig> target genes, indicating a wide regulatory function for these mirnas. in addition, there were  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas without a predicted target gene , making it difficult to understand the function of these mirnas. this is also indicative of the limitation of the current mapping methods. further experiments and analyses are needed to confirm accurate functions of these mirnas and their target genes.fig.  <dig> the distribution of target gene numbers for differentially expressed mirnas among banana ripening process. the differentially expressed mirnas of ethylene/1-mcp and their targeted genes are analyzed in this figure. the x-axis represents the interval for the target gene number of each mirna. the y-axis represents the number of mirna in each interval



the ripening-related targets for conserved mirnas found in this study were similar to verified plant mirna targets previously reported to have functional relevance. some target genes were annotated as transcription factors . for example, the mir <dig> and mir <dig> family members were identified to target the squamosa promoter-binding-like protein genes   <cit> . the mir <dig> family members were identified to target the floral homeotic protein apetala  <dig> gene   <cit> . the mir <dig> family members were identified to target the myb family of transcription factors. previous studies have proven that ectopic expression of strawberry famyb <dig> could suppress anthocyanin and flavonol accumulation in tobacco  <cit> . the targets of the mir <dig> and mir <dig> family members belonged to the gamyb transcription factor family, which is reported to affect flower development in the anther  <cit> . the mir <dig> family members were identified to a target nuclear transcription factor y subunit a- <dig>  which acts to control primary root growth in arabidopsis  <cit> . auxin response factor , a transcription factor, was found to regulate root growth in arabidopsis  <cit> . in our study, mac-mir160a and mac-mir160b potentially target arf <dig>  arf <dig> and arf <dig>  notably, the mir <dig> family members were identified to target ethylene insensitive  <dig> , a well-known transcription factor involved in the fruit ripening pathway  <cit> . moreover, some target genes of differentially expressed mirnas were annotated as functional proteins involved in fruit ripening. for instance, the mir <dig> family members were also identified to target an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase, an important component of the 26s proteasome. recent studies indicated that the e <dig> enzyme, one component of the 26s proteasome, was involved in regulating fruit ripening  <cit>  and that the 26s proteasome pathway also could affect the timing of fruit ripening through controlling the degradation of ethylene receptors in tomatoes  <cit> . protein phosphatase 2a  was reported to control ethylene synthesis by modulating the turnover of acc synthase  <cit> . in this study, the protein phosphatase 2a regulatory b subunit gene  was an identified target of several mir <dig> family members and mac-nmir <dig>  interestingly, one of the targets for the novel mirna mac-nmir <dig> is β-galactosidase, which is a key softening-related enzyme  <cit> . the endo- <dig> -beta-glucosidase targeted by mac-mir166u, mac-mir166e and mac-mir171b are also thought to be involved in fruit ripening  <cit> . additionally, some target genes were annotated as uncharacterized and hypothetical proteins. these results suggest that these mirnas and their target genes might play crucial regulatory roles in the ethylene-induced ripening of bananas, but more experimental validation is needed to confirm their function and regulation.

to further assess the putative functions of the  <dig> predicted targeted genes, a gene ontology  analysis was performed using the blast  <dig> go program  . go analysis contained three ontologies, biological processes, cellular components and molecular function. twenty different biological processes, nine different cellular components and  <dig> different molecular functions were predicted . the enrichment of each go term within the biological processes and the cellular components were comparative, and most are involved in metabolic or biosynthetic processes. as for molecular functions, the binding terms and related binding terms comprised most of the targeted genes, which is consistent with a regulatory role for these mirnas in the transcription and translation processes  <cit> . in addition, kegg pathway analysis was performed to illuminate the biological interpretation of the differentially expressed mirna target genes. the top  <dig> enriched pathways were identified with  <dig> genes . “metabolic pathways” was the most significantly enriched term with respect to the richness factor and gene number  , suggesting an important role for metabolism in the ethylene-induced ripening process of the banana fruit.fig.  <dig> gene ontology of the predicted targets for differentially expressed mirnas. the targeted genes of differentially expressed mirnas in the comparison of ethylene/1-mcp is analyzed in this figure. the right-hand-side scale is the targeted gene numbers corresponding to the go terms. the left-hand-side scale is the percent of the targeted gene numbers corresponding to the go terms

validation of the expression profiles of differentially expressed mirnas and their target genes
in this study, qrt-pcr was adopted to confirm the sequencing results of the differentially expressed mirnas and their potential targets. five differentially expressed mirnas and nine corresponding targets were selected and validated with qrt-pcr. after ethylene treatment, the expression of mac-mir156a and mac-mir172e was down-regulated on day  <dig> and then up-regulated at day  <dig> and day  <dig> compared with that of day  <dig>  while after 1-mcp treatment, the expression of these mirna was up-regulated at day  <dig> and then down-regulated at days  <dig> and  <dig> compared with that of day  <dig> . the expression of mac-mir395d and mac-mir166e were down-regulated in response to ethylene treatment and at similar levels or up-regulated in response to 1-mcp treatment. in addition, the expression levels of mac-mir171b were slightly increased after ethylene treatment and decreased in response to 1-mcp treatment. overall, the results were consistent with the srna high-throughput sequencing data. usually, mirnas and their target genes have contrasting expression patterns. thus, we also checked the expression levels of four predicted target genes  for mac-mir156a, two predicted target genes  for mac-mir172e, and one predicted target gene each  for mac-mir395d, mac-mir171b and mac-mir166e, respectively. the results show the expected inverse relationship during ripening between mac-mir156a and its target genes spl <dig> and spl <dig>  mac-mir395d and its target gene ein <dig>  and mac-mir166e and its target gene endo- <dig> -beta-glucosidase  <dig> . these data suggest that these mirnas might affect ripening by regulating the expression of these potential fruit ripening-related genes. however, the expression of mac-mir171b and its target gene scrarecrow tf, mac-mir156a and its target genes spl <dig> and pp2a-b-ι, mac-mir172e and its target genes apetla <dig> and phap2a show no contrasting expression patterns, indicating that these may not be target genes. this might be due to false prediction results from the highly repetitive motifs that correspond to the mirna sequence in the gene sequences. therefore, more experimental verification is needed to clarify the regulatory mechanism of mirnas and their targets in the ripening process of the banana fruit.fig.  <dig> quantitative expression analyses of several differentially expressed mirnas and their target genes. the expression level in day  <dig> was set as  <dig>  u <dig> rrna and cac  gene was used as the internal control for mirna expression and targeted genes expression respectively. each bar indicates the mean ± se of triplicate assays. the different letters indicate significant differences at p <  <dig>  using fisher’s protected least significant difference  tests



notablely, ein <dig>  the predicted target gene of mir <dig>  a very important regulator in tomato ripening process. ein <dig> can activate a variety of ethylene-response genes that involved in ripening  <cit> . recent studies shown that rnai-line of ein <dig> displayed a delayed ripening phenotype, and exhibited normal vegetative growth in tomato  <cit> . moreover, according to our mirnas sequencing results of different development stage fruit , the expression level of mir <dig> in early mature green stage  shows about  <dig> times higher expression than that in late mature green stage . these results indicate that except regulating sulfate assimilation  <cit>  mirna <dig> maybe play important role in banana fruit ripening. therefore, maybe we can delay banana fruit ripening process by overexpressing mirna <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we identified a total of  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas from the banana fruit in response to ethylene or 1-mcp treatment using illumina hiseq <dig> sequencing methods. analysis of differential expression data suggested these mirnas play an important role in ethylene-induced ripening of bananas. in total,  <dig> corresponding target genes were predicted for these mrnas, and their functions were discussed. go enrichment analysis of target genes for the differentially expressed mirnas revealed that some mirna-targeted genes are closely related to fruit ripening. when combined with computational analysis and experimental confirmation, the findings of this study provide valuable information for further functional analysis of the mirnas involved in banana fruit ripening.
