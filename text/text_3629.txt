BACKGROUND
actinobacteria, are filamentous gram positive prokaryotes with 67-78% g + c content  <cit> . actinobacteria are considered as an intermediate group of bacteria and fungi and are recognized as prokaryotic organisms. actinobacteria are present in various ecological habitats and marine environments  <cit>  and to cope with the environmental stress, marine microorganisms have developed a complex stress management for their survival, which is being unrevealed for multiple purposes  <cit> . they are being exploited for various commercial applications in environmental, biomedical and industrial sectors  <cit> . various metabolites of actinobacterial origin have been reported for their excellent bioactivity  <cit> . marine environment is the prime reservoir of biological diversity and the marine microorganisms are recognized to be rich sources of novel compounds. in india, about  <dig> natural products were derived from marine microbes  <cit> , in which, marine actinobacteria have been proven as a potential source of bioactive compounds and richest source of secondary metabolites. they are the most economically and biotechnologically valuable prokaryotes.

currently, enzymes and drugs from microbial origin are substituting the chemical catalysts in leather, food, paper, pharmaceuticals and textile industries  <cit> . majority of the enzymes are derived from plants, animals and microorganisms. among them, microbes are the topmost due to their rapid doubling time and enzyme production when compared with plants or animals to meet the existing market demand for industrial enzymes  <cit> . marine actinobacteria are capable of producing enzymes with good stability at higher temperature and alkaline conditions. even though, the production of antibiotics as major bioactive compounds from marine actinobacteria  <cit>  the ability to synthesize variety of industrial enzymes can be an attractive phenomenon to accomplish our future demand.

a little is known about the diversity of actinobacteria in marine sediments, which is an inexhaustible resource that has not been properly exploited. many reports suggested that marine sediment is a rich source of actinobacteria  <cit> . andaman coast in india is holding outsized diverse and unexploited ecosystem for the isolation of novel actinobacteria with effective bioactive molecules  <cit> . the andaman and nicobar  islands marine ecosystem are mostly unexplored, and may provide a rich source of microorganisms producing novel and efficient antimicrobial compounds  <cit> . only limited research on marine actinobacteria from a & n islands has been reported. to our knowledge, no studies have been reported on the characterization of marine actinobacteria from port blair bay of a & n islands. rather, these islands are an unexploited part of indian seas and have rarely been explored for microbial diversity research and their metabolites. hence, there is an immense possibility to identify and functionally characterize new marine actinobacteria to identify novel bioactive compounds. accordingly, the present study at port blair bay of a & n islands aimed to isolate and functionally characterize the marine actinobacteria of industrial and pharmaceutical interest with the ultimate objective of discovering novel bioactive compounds.

research on marine actinobacteria from a & n islands is very scanty and till date these island resources have not been properly explored to identify novel microorganisms with potential biological properties. with this outlook, the present research has been initiated to identify novel actinobacterial isolates from marine sediments of minnie bay, south andaman island. in this study, actinobacterial strains were isolated using modified growth medium. it has already been reported the usage of aged seawater enriched modified media for the isolation of marine actinobacteria  <cit> . various selective media were used for isolation and enumeration of actionobacteria  <cit> .

streptomyces and saccharopolyspora were found to be the dominant genera and their occurrence in bay of bengal was already reported  <cit> . frequency and dominance of streptomyces in various sources have also been reported  <cit> . majority of the isolates in this study possessed coiled mycelia and the same morphology has been reported by roes and meyer  <cit> . spore morphology is considered as one of the important characteristic features in actinobacterial identification and it varies among the genus and species  <cit> . moreover, the results acquired in this study have been outlined in bergey’s manual of systematic bacteriology  <cit>  and laboratory manual for identification of actinomycetes  <cit> . diversity of actinobacteria in chesapeake bay was also reported similar to our mode of observations  <cit> . based on growth studies, it was made known that majority of the isolates grew well in modified sca medium. this has been already reported in actinobacterial community isolated from bay of bengal  <cit> . varied pigment production pattern was also observed among our isolates. shirling and gottileb  <cit>  reported that the pigmentation prototype can be used as markers for identification. moreover, cultural characteristics and utilization of carbon by the isolates in different media  also play a major role in identification of actinobacteria to generic level. it is also proved that different physiological characteristics will certainly influence the growth rate of actinobacteria  <cit> .

actinobacteria are the main basis of clinically significant antibiotics  <cit> . recent reports revealed that about  <dig>  patents have been issued on actinobacteria related product and process. the genus saccharopolyspora of pseudonocardiaceae family is recognized for producing various antibiotics like vancomycin, erythromycin and rifamycins  <cit> . majority of our isolates exhibited appreciable antibacterial activity against tested clinical pathogens. of three solvents used, ethyl acetate extract of streptomyces sp. niot-vkkma <dig> determined better inhibitory activity. earlier report  <cit>  also revealed the effectiveness of ethyl acetate extracts from actinobacteria for antibacterial studies with that of other solvents. for the first of its kind, grein and meyers  <cit>  have reported on antagonistic marine actinobacteria. of their  <dig> isolates from marine sediments of new jersey and florida, 50% demonstrated antibiotic activity against gram positive and gram negative bacteria. modest information on antimicrobial potential of marine actinobacteria from a & n islands was previously reported. of  <dig> marine actinobacterial isolates, only three isolates revealed noticeable antibacterial activity among test pathogens  <cit> . however, another report  <cit>  disclosed that, of  <dig> isolates, only limited bioactivity  was observed among test pathogens studied. as on date, our report will be the first to reveal a detailed study on antagonistic activity of marine actinobacteria from a & n islands against both gram positive and gram negative eubacteria. in this study, majority of the isolates dominated in antibacterial potential against test pathogens. the reason may be the complex biochemical pathways adopted by our isolates due to the available nutrients and osmotic flux in sampling site.

surfactants are amphiphilic compounds, produced by microorganisms of various classes including glycolipids, lipopeptides, fatty acids, phospholipids, neutral lipids and lipopolysaccharides  <cit> . applications of surfactants includes excellent detergency, emulsification, foaming, wetting, penetrating, thickening, microbial growth enhancements, metal sequestering and oil recovering. surfactants are promising compounds and offer several advantages over chemically synthesized surfactants due to its lower toxicity, biodegradability and ecological acceptability  <cit> . to our credit, streptomyces sp. niot-vkkma <dig> was found to have excellent emulsification property. marine actinobacteria are good candidates for surfactant production, bioremediation and biodegradation  <cit> . halotolerant streptomyces was reported to be a good surfactant producer  <cit> . based on literature survey, our study stands first in reporting surfactant production from marine actinobacteria of a & n islands.

growth survival studies of our isolates also accomplished to withstand in varied nacl and ph levels. based on previous reports, majority of the actinobacterial species isolated from marine sediments were moderate alkaliphilic and moderate halophilic in nature  <cit> . to cope with the external stress, these organisms have developed adaptive metabolic features to survive under extreme conditions  <cit> . nesterenkonia alba sp. nov., an alkaliphilic actinobacterium was reported to grow optimally at ph 9– <dig>  <cit> . chen et al.  <cit>  also reported a halophilic marine actinomycete, nocardiopsis litoralis sp. nov., isolated from a sea anemone.

actinobacteria are physiologically diverse group in synthesizing various enzymes and metabolic products of industrial interest and are well recognized to produce most valuable pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals  <cit> . marine actinobacteria isolated from east and west coast of india were reported in the production of various industrial enzymes  <cit> . upon characterization for industrially potential enzymes, results from the potential isolates of our study revealed highly competent enzyme activity with that of previous reports. bernfield  <cit>  isolated several actinobacteria from marine sediments of the central and west coast of peru with multienzyme activity. selvam et al.  <cit>  reported  <dig>  u/ml of amylase production from actinomycetes isolated from south indian coastal region. while comparing with this result, streptomyces sp. niot-vkkma <dig> synthesized  <dig>  u/ml of protease enzyme, which is two fold increases to that of previous report and the same augment was also recorded in cellulase production by the same strain. hung-der and kuo-shu  <cit>  reported that the actinomycete, streptomyces transformant t3- <dig> produced  <dig>  u/ml of thermostable cellulase. estimation of protease enzyme production also determined higher production level with the potential isolate. ramesh et al.  <cit>   <dig> reported that, streptomyces fungicidicus mml <dig> isolated from bay of bengal produced  <dig>  u/ml of thermostable alkaline protease. these results on enzymatic production authenticated the capability of our isolate to over synthesize the valuable enzymes of industrial importance. phylogenetic analyses also make known that streptomyces sp. niot-vkkma <dig>  streptomyces sp. niot-vkkma <dig> and saccharopolyspora sp. niot-vkkma <dig> form a separate cluster with streptomyces griseus, streptomyces venezuelae and saccharopolyspora salina, respectively. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on detailed characterization on enzymes with industrial and pharmaceutical importance from three novel marine actinobacteria of a & n islands.

CONCLUSIONS
in the current scenario, both academic and industrial research mainly focuses on marine microorganisms due to its impulsive potential. these credentials initiate the present research in search of salt and alkali tolerant novel actinobacteria from unexplored a & n islands. our study would be the first instance in comprehensive characterization of marine actinobacteria for industrial and pharmaceutical byproducts. enhanced salt, ph and temperature tolerance of the isolates along with their capacity to secrete commercially valuable primary and secondary metabolites emerges an attractive feature of these organisms. further, molecular characterization approach on these biological molecules will certainly bring out a new horizon in elevated production and can avoid complex downstream process associated with conventional methods. it is concluded that very frequent and systematic screening of marine actinobacteria from different sources and locations in a & n islands may facilitate us to isolate and characterize more novel species with admirable bioactive compounds of interest.
