BACKGROUND
sex chromosomes evolved independently many times in both animals and plants  <cit> . the initial steps of their evolution, including the genetic degeneration of the non-recombining y or w chromosomes , have received great interest from geneticists. to date, most of our knowledge about sex chromosome evolution stems from a few animal systems with evolutionary old sex chromosomes  <cit> . however, evolutionarily young sex chromosomes are needed to investigate the early steps in sex chromosome evolution. such sex chromosomes can be found in plants  <cit> . although the majority of plants are cosexuals, forming either bisexual flowers  or unisexual flowers of both sexes on one individual , dioecious plant species  have evolved multiple times in different plant lineages  <cit> . the majority of dioecious plant species lack morphologically distinguishable sex chromosomes. however, well differentiated heteromorphic sex chromosomes were described in rumex acetosa, cannabis sativa and silene latifolia. the latter has become a model species for investigations into the evolution of sex chromosomes in plants.

silene latifolia poiret  is a strictly dioecious, perennial herb of the caryophyllaceae family. the sex of individual plants is genetically determined by sex chromosomes that were first described independently by blackburn  <cit>  and winge  <cit> . females are homogametic with a pair of x chromosomes, while the males are heterogametic, xy  <cit> . the x and y chromosomes are about  <dig> -fold and 2-fold larger than the largest autosome, respectively  <cit> . therefore, they contribute substantially to the large genome size of the species and to the slightly larger genome size in males than in females  <cit> . the y chromosome in s. latifolia seems to lack some essential genes present on the x, since plants are not viable unless they have at least one x chromosome  <cit> . by analyzing hermaphroditic mutants and their progeny, westergaard  <cit>  showed that all independently derived hermaphrodites had deletions in one arm of the y chromosome. from the studies on deletion mutants, westergaard  <cit>  concluded that one arm of the y chromosome contains gene for anther maturation, while the other arm has gene suppressing carpel development, and additional genes located close to the centromere stimulate early stages of stamen development  <cit> . more recently, molecular markers in combination with a panel of deletion mutants were used to create a detailed map of the y chromosome  <cit> .

gene and genome duplications have been recognized as major forces driving the evolution of animal and plant genomes. two basic processes can cause duplication of genes. the first process, segmental duplication, keeps the structure of a gene  in its original constitution. the duplicated copy of the gene maintains expression patterns similar to the original copy. the second process, retrotransposition, often generates non-functional gene copies that lack regulatory elements and introns  <cit> .

the evolution of sex chromosomes is a complex genetic and epigenetic process  <cit> , which is often accompanied by structural rearrangements and accumulation of repetitive dna in non-recombining regions. moreover, intensive gene turnover within sex chromosomes is reflected by a high number of retroposed genes both on x and y chromosomes  <cit> . it is known that over the course of s. latifolia sex chromosome evolution, many repetitive elements have accumulated on the y chromosome  <cit> . however, we still lack information about which elements are linked to degenerative processes in y chromosome evolution by either genetic or epigenetic mechanisms  <cit> , and little is known about the structural and functional role of repetitive dna in y linked genic regions of this plant.

here we unravel the structure and evolution of a sex linked gene, slap <dig>  first reported as having originated by duplication from autosomes to the y chromosome in s. latifolia  <cit> . since slap3y is located close to the oldest stratum  in the y chromosome, this gene is a candidate to be affected by various degenerative processes  <cit> . in our study, we did not find evidence for a duplication event in the case of this gene. instead, we identified a new pair of sex linked alleles with no evidence for autosomal paralogues. we demonstrated the accumulation of retrotransposon sequences in an intron region of the y linked allele. we further analyzed expression patterns of individual elements identified in the y copy of slap <dig> gene to reveal their role in y chromosome evolution.

RESULTS
identification of genomic clones for apetala <dig>  gene
s. latifolia and s. vulgaris bac libraries were screened with slap3a and slap3y gene derived probes prepared using the sequences and primers from matsunaga et al.  <cit> . positively hybridizing clones were selected, and the presence of the target gene was verified by pcr including sequencing of pcr products. in total, we identified four clones containing the ap <dig> gene in the s. latifolia bac library. two clones contained the presumed autosomal slap3a copy  and the other two contained slap3y . four copies of an orthologue, which we called svap <dig>  were identified in the s. vulgaris bac library. both bacs containing the slap3y copy were selected for further complete bac sequencing. for the slap3a and svap <dig> bac clones, we isolated dna, digested it with hindiii and conducted a southern blot hybridization. the original probes from the bac library screening were used for the hybridization. subsequent experiments revealed no difference in hybridization patterns within bac groups  . differences in signal intensity of individual hybridizing bacs are due mainly to the different sizes of bac inserts, which prevented us from using equimolar amounts during gel loading. based on complete sequence similarity  and an identical hybridization profile, we randomly selected bac clones 91/m <dig> , 251/l <dig>  and 30/l <dig>  253/j <dig>  for a more detailed analysis. the data obtained strongly suggest that there is just one allelic pair of the slap <dig> gene in both the s. latifolia and s. vulgaris genomes.

linkage mapping by pcr on microdissected chromosomes
to confirm the linkage of individual slap <dig> alleles to specific chromosomes, we microdissected and separated x chromosomes and autosomes in s. latifolia  and ran pcr using these chromosomes as templates. we used primers for pol sequence of the retand retroelement  <cit>  as a positive control. surprisingly, pcr with primers for the slap3a k-domain resulted in a product only with genomic dna of both sexes and using microdissected x chromosomes as a template . we did not obtain any pcr product from microdissected autosomes, an observation which did not confirm the presumed presence of a copy of the slap3a gene on an autosome. these observations demonstrate that slap3a, originally described as an autosomal copy in matsunaga et al.  <cit> , is in fact an x linked allele of the slap3y gene, which we call from here on slap3x.

genomic organization
bac clones 251/l <dig>  30/l <dig>  253/j <dig> and 91/m <dig> were purified and sequenced. we identified a copy of the ap <dig> gene in all the bacs sequenced . comparison with mrna for s. latifolia slap3a  and slap3y  revealed seven exons for slap3y and svap <dig>  while slap3x contains only six exons .

the size of individual introns differed only slightly among the different copies of ap <dig> . the only exception was a very large intron  <dig>  in the slap3y allele. we found that this intron contains two different retroelements that are shuffled into each other. the first retroelement contains a pair of ltrs, reverse transcriptase, rnaseh, integrase and gag gene, while the sequence of the second retroelement is incomplete and composed of ltrs and orf <dig> product from athila orf- <dig> family .

genomic distribution of repetitive dna in slap3y intron
all coding domains  and ltrs were used as probes for fish on mitotic metaphase chromosomes . analysis of the distribution of individual signals did not indicate a specific role of these particular retroelements in y chromosome evolution . fish analysis was also conducted with the tandemly arrayed repetitive y promoter motive. there was no signal both after standard and low stringency fish experiments, indicating a low abundance of this repetitive satellite motif in the s. latifolia genome.

expression analysis of y linked retroelements
to reveal activity  of individual repetitive elements linked to slap3y and their domains, we conducted rt-pcr experiments . retroelement a  and line were expressed in both males and females in different tissues . surprisingly, retroelement b had a different pattern of expression between the ltr part and the rest of its genes. although integrase and rt domain showed similarly to retroelement a, and line widespread expression in both sexes and all tissues, the ltr b region was expressed only in the floral buds of both sexes.

we quantified the expression of individual domains of the retroelements localized in the slap3y copy by identifying the number of hits with the male and female specific est database of s. latifolia. this database is composed of ca  <dig>  reads generated by  <dig> sequencing  using cdna from male and female buds as a sequencing template. the accuracy of the selected approach was tested by comparing the occurrence of part of the actin gene in both male and female est databases . internalpart of retroelement b  revealed a similar number of hits  in both males and females. ltr a, ltr b and line element expression was stronger in males based on the est database data. ltr b, which has 28Ã— higher expression in males than in females, was the most different.

promoter structure analysis
by comparing promoter sequence structure, we discovered significant differences in slap3y in comparison with slap3x and svap <dig>  a part of the slap3y promoter is formed by a  <dig> bp long direct repeat. both ends of the repeat are bordered by inverted tandem structures that resemble the organization of a mite element . genbank database searches revealed no similarity of this part of the promoter to any known sequence, except for the mros <dig> gene  <cit>  promoter region . although mros <dig> is not a sex-linked gene, like slap3y it is expressed only in males.

sequence divergence analysis
in s. latifolia, recombination between the sex chromosomes has ceased in three steps, and three groups of genes with different levels of divergence  have been identified  <cit> . the level of divergence between slap <dig> x and y copies is about 13% , between the 20% x-y divergence typical of the stratum  <dig> genes and the 10% x-y divergence typical of the stratum  <dig> genes.

we conducted a dn/ds analysis on the slap <dig> sequence to study the possibility of differences in intensity and form of selection in the x and y copies of this gene . we included all available orthologous sequences from silene species to have as many sequences as possible for the phylogenetic dn/ds analysis, which tends to give more accurate results with more sequences, and to have outgroups . the results are reported in table  <dig> and in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  the dn/ds ratios in x and y sequences among dioecious silene species were not found to be significantly different, which does not provide clear evidence of the y copy degeneration. however, dn/ds ratios were found to be significantly different  between dioecious and non-dioecious lineages. the higher ratio in the dioecious lineage suggests that selection has been relaxed in both the x and y sequences compared to the autosomal copy in s. vulgaris and s. conica where dn/ds is much lower .

discussion
by screening more than five haploid complements of the s. latifolia genome, we identified two copies each of slap3y and slap3a genes. the number of identified bac clones containing variants of the y and the presumed autosomal copy suggests that slap <dig> is a single copy gene. according to matsunaga et al.  <cit> , the y copy of slap <dig> is a paralog of an autosomal allele that was transferred onto the y chromosome after the beginning of sex chromosome evolution in silene. although the authors mentioned the existence of introns in both paralogs, genomic sequence data were not presented. to decipher the mechanism of the translocation of slap <dig> gene within the s. latifolia genome, we isolated and sequenced bac clones containing slap <dig> paralogs. moreover, we isolated and sequenced slap <dig> gene from the s. vulgaris genome  and named this gene svap <dig> . comparison of the orthologs between s. latifolia and s. vulgaris revealed that the y copy of s. latifolia and the autosomal copy of s. vulgaris have seven introns, whereas the x copy of s. latifolia contains only six introns. surprisingly, the promoter region of slap3y copy is completely different from both svap <dig> and slap3a.

to study the extent of the translocated autosomal region on the y chromosome we intended to select low copy markers in the y bac clone and to map them on dissected sex chromosomes and autosomes by pcr. however, pcr with the slap <dig> specific primers revealed different localization of slap <dig> paralogues in the genome than expected. while we were able to amplify slap <dig> gene copies using x chromosomes as templates, there was no pcr product when only autosomes served as a template. these observations show that slap <dig> is a regular sex-linked gene with x and y alleles, and that no transfer to the y chromosome has occurred. our data suggest different results as shown in matsunaga et al.  <cit> . the simplest explanation in this case could be use of different techniques for separation of sex chromosomes. chromosome sorting used by matsunaga et al.  <cit>  is a powerful method which generates large amount of dna for further experiments. the main disadvantage of this method is that it is subject to impurities even when the chromosomes being sorted are significantly morphologically different, as is the case for s. latifolia sex chromosomes and autosomes  <cit> . unlike chromosome sorting, laser microdissection is more laborious but produces a pure fraction of selected material  <cit> .

based on comparisons of the x and y alleles we showed that slap3x and slap3y started to diverge quite early: their divergence at synonymous sites  is close to the maximum x-y divergence recorded so far for s. latifolia sex linked genes, although the mapping of slap <dig> on the x chromosome is needed to confirm this. no clear evidence of degeneration of the y copy has been found in this case. rather, the dn/ds values for dioecious vs. non-dioecious lineages suggest a subfunctionalization in which x and y copies have differentially retained their ancestral functions , as has been hypothesized for some sex-linked genes in humans  <cit> . moreover, a branch-site analysis  revealed no significant evidence for positive selection on the y sequences , which further supports subfunctionalization. furthermore, the expression patterns of the y copies and the x copies also suggest subfunctionalization  <cit> . the observed differences in expression patterns between slap3x and slap3y are due to regulatory differences of particular alleles in males, where both slap3x and slap3y are present. comparisons of promoter sequences of all three copies of ap <dig> revealed that the autosomal promoter in s. vulgaris is identical to the slap3x promoter. surprisingly, there is a unique  <dig> bp promoter region in the slap3y copy. the only regulatory sequence that shows similarity with this y promoter specific structure is a part of the mros <dig> gene promoter in s. latifolia  <cit> . this gene  is also expressed exclusively in males. although the role of the identified promoter with the same expression pattern of both slap3y and mros <dig> should be verified by e.g. transformation of a plant with "promoter-reporter gene " construct, an efficient transformation protocol is not yet available for silene species. the most prominent evidence suggesting a role of the promoter in sex-specific gene expression regulation is its uniqueness in genome of s. latifolia; it appears only in a genic context and mainly co-occurrs with sex specifically expressed genes. although it is a tandem repeat, it shows no accumulation in s. latifolia genome. even a genbank search of silene species derived sequences shows no hits with these repetitive dna fractions.

our results have implications for intron size evolution in evolving sex chromosomes. we identified a very large intron containing two retrotransposons between the exons  <dig> and  <dig> of slap3y. a similar phenomenon showing accumulation of different sequences in the y linked introns was previously reported for some other s. latifolia genes  <cit> . although it is known that different repetitive elements such as microsatellites  <cit> , tandem repeats  <cit> , organellar dna  <cit>  and different retrotransposons  <cit>  have played a prominent role in the formation of sex chromosomes in s. latifolia, there is no direct link between the structural role of such elements and their impact on degeneration of the y chromosome. to assess the role of these repetitive elements in the y chromosome evolution we ran fish experiments and expression  analysis. although we did not find specific accumulation of the studied elements in the y chromosome, we observed different expression patterns among different retroelements and in different tissues. rt-pcr data showed that the ltr b domain, unlike other parts of retroelement b, is specifically expressed in the floral buds of both sexes. these data show an increased activation of a specific type of retroelement during early developmental stages. this phenomenon could be linked to meiotic stages of cells in developing buds when the epigenetic status of genetic information is reassembled and the regulatory role of epigenetic mechanisms is suppressed. a higher expression level was found in ltr a, line and especially ltr b in male bud tissue based on in silico analysis using est databases. although it is known that in males, germ line activity of some retroelements is elevated compared to females  <cit> , we suggest several explanations that concern the evolution of sex chromosomes. it is known from recent papers  <cit> , that y linked genes contain more repetitive elements in their introns compared to x alleles. higher expression of such y linked retroelements could be a consequence of co-expression of the element with y linked genes. biased occurrence of both ltrs identified in the slap3y gene in male est database could also be explained by another aspect of sex chromosomes evolution. once a retroelement appears in a y linked gene it follows the same rules for degenerative processes as y linked genes. entire retrotransposonal genes could loose their functions by mutation accumulation and the introduction of stop codons. retrotranscription begins in the ltr region, and thus this part of the retrotransposon is kept in the expressome even after termination of transcription in other parts of the retroelement . it is also known that unpaired dna caused by retrotransposon insertion into a chromosome is recognized by rnai machinery and consequently homologous rna is degraded  <cit> 
. since there is no pairing of chromosomes in non-recombining regions of sex chromosomes, this mechanism is not triggered in this case and expression of retrotransposons is not regulated in males.

our data further suggest that previously published retroelement types that are accumulated on the y chromosome  <cit>  are different from those that participate in intron targeting of y linked genes. analysis of the y promoter linked repetitive microsatellite motif within a mite element reveals a low abundance in s. latifolia genome. paradoxically, the sequences responsible for the large size of sex chromosomes may thus be different from those that have potentially caused degeneration of y linked genes.

CONCLUSIONS
this study unravels the structure and evolution of ap <dig>  a sex linked gene with copies on the x and y chromosomes in the dioecious plant s. latifolia. this gene was previously reported to be located on the autosomes, with one copy having been transferred by duplication to the y chromosome. our results provide evidence for the location of copies on x and y chromosomes, and the absence of this gene on autosomes. divergence between the x and y-linked copies both at sequence  and gene expression levels suggests subfunctionalization has been an important process in the evolutionary dynamics of this gene. one intron of the y-linked allele was invaded by retrotransposons that display sex-specific expression patterns, similar to the expression pattern of the corresponding allele, which suggests transposable elements may have contributed to the evolution of gene expression of this gene
