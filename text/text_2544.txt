BACKGROUND
polyploidy has occurred during evolution of various fish groups  <cit>  while gynogenesis is a natural form of reproduction in some species  <cit> . spontaneous polyploids have also been observed in both wild and farmed fish  <cit> . induced chromosome set manipulation is a methodology that has been exploited over a long period in fish research . the ability to retain the second polar body post-fertilisation and/or suppress first cell division by temperature, chemical or pressure shocks, coupled with the relative ease of gamete inactivation by irradiation has led to its widespread use. the various chromosome sets that can be generated  have been exploited in a wide range of studies including gene mapping  <cit> , genome assembly  <cit> , construction of isogenic lines  <cit>  and production of sterile farm fish  <cit> .

european seabass is an important mariculture species, extensively farmed in the mediterranean basin. the need to develop genetic and genomic resources to underpin future development of this species is clearly recognised, and has resulted in the production of a first draft genome assembly  <cit> , a number of linkage maps  and a radiation hybrid panel  <cit> . a further key resource would be the development of isogenic lines through androgenesis  <cit>  or mitotic gynogenesis  <cit> . these have not been successfully established yet, despite significant efforts .

though widely practised, there are a number of technical pitfalls that can impact the effectiveness of induced gynogenesis and androgenesis. for example, there can be a potential genetic contribution from the irradiated gamete source, this being associated with poorly optimised protocols leading to incomplete inactivation  <cit> . furthermore, the efficiency of protocols designed to retain chromosome sets post fertilisation/activation can also be severely affected by gamete quality and slight alterations in the timing and intensity of the applied shock  <cit> . spontaneous retention of the second polar body  <cit>  may also generate additional unexpected  ploidy states. one of the bottlenecks in production of isogenic lines through mitotic gynogenesis is spontaneous meiotic gynogenetics  <cit> , which have some level of heterozygosity through retention of the second polar body, and need to be detected and eliminated from putative mitotic gynogenetic fish for the reliable production of isogenic lines in the subsequent generation.

throughout the development of the technology, genetic markers have been used to monitor the effectiveness of the procedure. to date this has generally involved screening with a small panel of available markers, to confirm the presence/absence of particular parental chromosomal sets. these markers include pigmentation genes, allozymes, multilocus minisatellites and microsatellites  <cit> . while this approach can give an indication as to the effectiveness of the treatment, it is relatively insensitive for detection and quantification of potential instances of aneuploidy. another limitation to using a small number of markers is that those that happen to be located close to centromeric regions will be compromised with respect to their ability to detect crossover events. this is a key requirement, for example, for differentiating between mitotic and meiotic gynogenetics; i.e. informative  telomeric markers will be heterozygous in meiotic gynogenetics and homozygous in mitotic gynogenetics, while informative centromeric markers will largely be homozygous in both types.

the advent of genotyping by sequencing approaches that exploit next generation sequencing technologies  <cit>  permits the simultaneous discovery and screening of large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms  per individual at a realistic cost. this provides an opportunity to more accurately assess the effectiveness of various elements of chromosomal set manipulation procedures. in this study snps generated by double digest restriction associated dna  sequencing  were employed to comprehensively examine parental genetic contributions in an experimentally generated meiotic gynogenetic family of european seabass, dicentrarchus labrax. the main objectives of the study were to  look for potential paternal contribution from uv-irradiated sperm;  generate a snp locus - centromere map; and iii) screen informative  markers for their potential to distinguish between mitotic and meiotic gynogenetics.

methods
production of mapping family – meiotic gynogenetics
the meiotic gynogenetic seabass family was produced at the ifremer experimental aquaculture station , using parent fish from a west mediterranean broodstock population. broodstock were aged  <dig> to 6 years and weighed  <dig> to 5 kg, and were kept in recirculating systems  maintained under natural conditions of temperature and photoperiod  and fed commercial diets . spermiating males were identified by gentle abdominal pressure and held in a handling tank. female maturation stage was assessed from ovarian biopsies obtained by introducing a thin catheter  into the genital orifice. females at the correct stage of development received a single dose  of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogue  in order to induce final maturation and ovulation. the uv irradiation device, used to inactivate the paternal genome, comprised of eight uv lamps  fixed above and below  a quartz plate which was mechanically agitated to stir sperm samples throughout irradiation. diluted sperm  from a single male  was irradiated in an  <dig>  cm diameter quartz petri dish for 8 min to apply a total dose of 326 mj/cm <dig>  <cit> .

the irradiated sperm were added to 125 ml of eggs  collected from a single female and then 125 ml of seawater was added to initiate fertilisation. a pressure shock of 8500 psi and 2 min duration was applied, starting at 6 min after fertilisation, to restore diploidy via retention of the second polar body  <cit> . all procedures were performed under total darkness in a temperature-controlled room maintained at 14 °c. eggs were incubated in 40 l tanks in a dedicated recirculating water system  until hatching. all tanks were maintained in darkness until sampling. ten days after hatching, a subset of  <dig> larvae were fixed in 99% ethanol; fin tissue from parents was also fixed in ethanol.

dna preparation
dna was extracted from all  <dig> offspring  and both parents  using a commercial salting out kit  according to the manufacturer’s protocol. this included the recommended rnase incubation step to reduce rna contamination in the final product. the dna concentration and purity of each sample was assessed by spectrophotometry , while its integrity was assessed by  <dig> % agarose gel electrophoresis. each sample was then preliminarily diluted to c. 50 ng/μl in 5 mm tris, ph  <dig> . a final, more accurate, fluorometric-based assessment of dna concentration was then performed on all samples using the qubit® dsdna hs assay kit . fluorescence measurements  were performed on a  <dig> well qpcr thermal cycler , with seabass dna concentrations being derived from a calibration curve generated from a set of standard dsdnas. based on these readings the seabass samples were diluted to c. 10 ng/μl in 5 mm tris, ph  <dig>  for use in ddrad library construction protocol.

ddrad library preparation and sequencing
the ddrad library preparation protocol used here is described in detail elsewhere  <cit> . in silico estimation from the seabass genome predicted  <dig>  ddrad fragments with paired sbfi-sphi restriction site overhangs, while after the size selection applied in the present study  only  <dig> fragments were predicted to be available.

briefly, a single restriction enzyme digestion/adapter ligation reaction was performed for each progeny sample, while triplicate reactions were made for both dam and sire dna samples. the latter ensured higher coverage of parental samples, which allowed more robust assignment of true snps in the pedigree. each sample  was digested at 37 °c for 30 min with  <dig>  u sbfi  and  <dig>  u sphi  high fidelity restriction enzymes  in a 6 μl reaction volume that included 1× cutsmart™ buffer . after cooling the reactions to room temperature, 3 μl of a premade barcode-adapter mix was added to the digested dna, and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. this adapter mix comprised individual-specific barcoded combinations of p <dig>  and p <dig>  adapters at 6 nm and 72 nm concentrations respectively, in 1× reaction buffer  <dig> . adapters were compatible with illumina sequencing chemistry . the barcoded adapters were designed such that adapter–genomic dna ligations did not reconstitute re sites, while residual re activity limited concatemerization of genomic fragments during ligation. the adapters included an inline five- or seven-base barcode for sample identification . ligation was performed over 40 min at 22 °c by addition of a further 3 μl of a ligation mix comprising 4 mm ratp , and  <dig> cohesive-end units of t <dig> ligase  in 1× cutsmart buffer.

the ligated samples were then heat denatured at 65 °c for 20 min, cooled, and combined into a single pool. the pooled sample was column-purified  and size selection of fragments, c. 320 bp to 590 bp, was performed by agarose gel electrophoresis. following gel purification  the eluted size-selected template dna  was pcr amplified  using a high fidelity taq polymerase . the pcr reactions were combined , and column-purified . the 55 μl elute, in eb buffer, was then subjected to a further size-selection clean up using an equal volume of ampure magnetic beads , to maximize removal of small fragments .

the final library was eluted in 20 μl eb buffer and sequenced over two full illumina miseq runs . the raw sequence data from this study were deposited at the ebi sequence read archive  with the accession number erp <dig> 

genotyping ddrad alleles
following initial analysis  to confirm that high-quality sequence data had been generated, the miseq reads were processed using stacks , a package designed specifically to identify and score snps from restriction-enzyme based sequence data. first, the ‘process_radtags’ function was used to demultiplex the individual samples. during this process sequence reads with quality scores below  <dig> , missing either restriction site or with ambiguous barcodes were discarded. barcodes were removed and all sequences were 3′ end trimmed to be  <dig> bases long. then reference based stacks analysis was performed, using ‘ref_map.pl’ perl script. sequence alignment/map  files were created using bowtie  <dig> aligner  <cit>  and the seabass genome . the main stacks parameter values used in this analysis were m =  <dig> and n =  <dig>  in order to maximise the number of informative markers investigated while minimising missing or erroneous data, only polymorphic ddrad-tags that containing  <dig> or less snps  and which were detected in both parents and present in at least 75% of the offspring were scored.

genetic linkage map construction
it was not feasible to construct a genetic linkage map de novo from the unordered meiotic gynogenetic family data. both r/onemap  <cit>  and tmap  <cit>  were explored for genetic linkage map construction without success. the final map was constructed using r/onemap after assigning markers to linkage groups based on the seabass genome assembly . genotypes were imported in outcross format into r/onemap in a modified way such that all genotypes shared the same segregation pattern . this package uses hidden markov models  algorithms for outbred species while in parallel implements the methodology described in  <cit> , for calculating the most probable linkage phase. recombination fraction between all pairs of markers was calculated using rf.2pts function. these groups were ordered using the order.seq function in four available two-point based algorithms including ser, rcd, rec and μg and the one which gave the smallest distance was selected for each lg. following ordering, markers in the same lg were forced to the final map by using force function after inspection of safe order. the order of markers was also inspected visually using rf.graph.table which plots a heat map of lod score and recombination frequency. map distances were calculated in centimorgans  using the kosambi mapping function. genetic mapper v <dig>   <cit>  was used for the final visualisation of genetic linkage map of meiotic gynogenetic d.labrax.

visualising physical position of markers and microsatellites from previous studies
outputs of genome aligner  were used for the positioning each ddradseq locus and visualised using genetic mapper v <dig>   <cit> . eleven microsatellite markers  <cit>  that have been used to differentiate between meiotic and mitotic gynogenetic sea bass  <cit>  were also assigned to the physical map once the genomic positions were identified using blastn .

marker-centromere mapping
centromeres are expected to be in regions with zero or low heterozygote frequency, with an increase in heterozygote frequency towards the telomeres. for each maternally informative ddradseq locus, heterozygosity  was computed across all progeny. marker-centromere map distances  were calculated using the formula 100*, under the assumption of complete interference, believed to be characteristic of fish species  <cit> .

comparison of genomic assembly with linkage maps
the genome assembly and the linkage map generated in the present study were compared to the recently published rad-based high-density snp-based genetic linkage map of palaiokostas et al.  <cit> , as an independent source for comparing marker order. common polymorphic loci between the two linkage maps were identified by blastn. first, the loci beginning with the common enzyme recognition site motif  from the present study  were trimmed down to 95 bp, compatible with the radseq p <dig> read length of  <cit> . then a local nucleotide database was generated on bioedit  from all assigned markers of  <cit>  and all polymorphic markers of the present study were blasted against them. stringent filtering options were applied to tabular output based on: i) e value ≤ 10− <dig>  and ii) alignment length ≥  <dig> bases .

estimation of recombination frequency per chromosome arm
scoring of homozygote/heterozygote distribution along the lgs of each individual progeny was used to estimate recombination, where a change from a region of homozygous markers  to a region of heterozygous markers was taken as a crossover point. this analysis was carried out on  <dig> chromosomes where chromosome arm structure could be discerned .

RESULTS
ddrad sequencing
a total of  <dig> , <dig> paired-end raw reads were produced from the combined two sequencing runs for the meiotic gynogenetic d. labrax family with  <dig> progeny . following demultiplexing using process_radtags,  <dig> % of the raw paired-end reads were retained . only one sample offspring  failed to produce sufficient reads  and was dropped from subsequent stacks analyses. as planned, the read numbers for both parents  exceeded those of offspring by a factor of c.  <dig> . read numbers for each sample are detailed in additional file 2: table s <dig>  the reference-based stacks analysis identified  <dig> unique ddrad loci and  <dig> potential snp loci .fig.  <dig> sequencing and ddrad-tag summary. detailed number of reads before and the after filters  followed by the reconstructed numbers of ddrad markers and polymorphic ddrad markers 




investigation of potential sire contribution
within the polymorphic marker dataset,  <dig> snps were identified with male-informative alleles, i.e. one  or both  alleles at a locus detected in the male parent alone. no male-specific alleles were detected in any of the offspring. later mapping of these loci to the seabass reference genome confirmed that these markers were located across all seabass chromosomes. thus no sire contribution was detected within the ddrad dataset for this gynogenetic family.

construction of female genetic linkage map
with the absence of paternal alleles confirmed, the marker dataset was refined to produce a robust set of informative snps for female map construction. dam homozygous markers were removed  as were loci where the minor allele frequency was < <dig>  among the progeny samples . additionally  <dig> loci were removed since both parental genotypes were missing. this left data from  <dig> female-informative snps to be used in linkage map construction. the position of each snp marker in the genome assembly is shown in additional file 3: table s <dig>  the genomic position and informativeness of microsatellites used by  <cit>  are shown in additional file 4: table s <dig>  and both sets of markers are integrated into a physical map in additional file 5: fig. s <dig> 

the linkage map  comprised  <dig> snps and was 1251 cm in length . average marker distance was  <dig>  cm with  <dig> markers possessing unique positions. linkage groups were between 23 cm  and 78 cm  in length  and comprised between  <dig>  and  <dig> markers . as the initial grouping of snps within the linkage map was based on the genome assembly, the distribution of markers was in accordance with  <dig> chromosome pairs in d. labrax .fig.  <dig> genetic linkage map of meiotic gynogenetic d. labrax. the positions on the left side of chromosomes are the distance in centimorgans , the circles on the right hand side represent observed heterozygosity levels at each map position . detailed data are provided in additional file 3: table s3





marker-centromere mapping
heterozygote frequencies for  <dig> female informative markers in the meiotic gynogenetic family ranged between zero and one . figure  <dig> shows a histogram of recombination frequencies and additional file 7: table s <dig> shows marker-centromere map distances. seven loci  showed 100% recombination , while  <dig> loci  showed zero recombination . almost half of the markers had heterozygote frequencies above  <dig>  , the expected maximum theoretical value for independent segregation between a marker and the centromere when multiple crossovers occur, indicating high interference.fig.  <dig> frequency distribution of marker-centromere distances, under the assumption of complete interference at  <dig> female heterogametic loci in meiotic gynogenetic european seabass




eleven chromosomes  showed single armed  behaviour, with heterozygosity rising from one end of the chromosome to the other reaching up to almost 100%. figure  <dig> shows an example of crossover points in a mono-arm chromosome  in individual progeny, with the overall pattern for lg <dig>  three chromosomes  fitted the mono-armed pattern with the exception of a single outlying marker . three chromosomes  represented a clear bi-armed pattern . one chromosome  fitted the bi-armed pattern with the exception of a single outlying marker . six chromosomes  did not show a clear pattern of heterozygosity along the chromosome that could enable us to assign an arm structure . this is summarised in table  <dig> fig.  <dig> detailed example of recombination mapping in a single sea bass linkage group , illustrating on the left side the computed recombination fraction for  <dig> progeny. empty circles represent homozygotes close to the centromere , and increasingly filled black dots represent higher frequencies of heterozygotes towards the telomeric region. the panel to the right represents randomly chosen individuals from the meiotic gynogenetic family, showing the recombination points in lg 11




to explore this further, we compared the rad locus positions from the dense linkage map of palaiokostas et al.  <cit>  with those in the genome assembly. all of the linkage groups of the  <cit>  map contained markers from the corresponding chromosome in the genome assembly, plus additional markers from unassigned  genome scaffolds. there were no cases where markers were assigned to different chromosomes in the assembly. the correlations for each linkage group are shown in additional file 8: table s <dig>  the six lgs which did not show a clear pattern of heterozygosity in the current study were all among the  <dig> lgs showing the lowest correlation in marker order between the dense linkage map and the physical assembly, suggesting an association between the accuracy of the genome assembly and the clarity of arm structure derived from the present data. of the  <dig> ddradseq markers in the linkage map based on the meiotic gynogenetic family,  <dig>  were also found in the denser radseq linkage map of  <cit> . all of these were found in the same linkage groups in both maps, and in the lgs with more than one such marker, the marker order in the present map corresponded to that of the denser map  <cit> .

after removing the six chromosomes that did not show clear heterozygosity patterns  and the single anomalous markers in three chromosomes , the mean recombination frequency per chromosome arm was  <dig>  . however, there were instances of multiple crossovers  in some chromosome arms .

discussion
the present study constructed the first gene-centromere linkage map  for the european seabass, in order to identify markers at the distal end of the chromosomes. such markers are more informative in discriminating between mitotic and meiotic gynogenetics, due to their higher recombination frequencies. given the large number of markers showing high frequencies of heterozygotes in the meiotic gynogenetic family , there would be a vanishingly small probability of mistaking a meiotic gynogenetic for a mitotic gynogenetic using such a marker set. this study also explored a second technical issue in the production of gynogenetic fish, that of potential paternal contribution following uv irradiation of sperm, by analysing large numbers of informative snp markers .

the genotyping-by-sequencing approach used in this study  proved to be very successful for both objectives, and also to be cost-effective for this purpose, generating  <dig> informative markers for the gene-centromere map and  <dig> informative markers for assessing potential paternal contribution, from the analysis of a single ddradseq library . it is feasible to prepare and sequence such a library in one to two weeks for relatively modest cost, and this technique could thus be used routinely in verifying the development of isogenic lines in this and other fish species. radseq  <cit>  and its derivative ddradseq  <cit>  have already been used for genetic linkage mapping in model and non-model organisms , studies on sex determination systems  <cit>  and qtl analysis  <cit> .

a requisite for successful production of uniparental fish is the ability to completely inactivate the genetic material in the irradiated gametes. in this study,  <dig> male informative snp markers were identified, none of which were detected in any of the  <dig> progeny. these markers were located across all  <dig> linkage groups, confirming a lack of paternal contribution at this level of resolution. it is clear that using this protocol  <cit>  we were able to produce a robust gynogenetic family, suitable for gene-centromere mapping.

a genetic linkage map, comprising  <dig> snps spanning  <dig>  cm with an average marker distance of  <dig>  cm, was constructed. approximately 95% of the female-informative snps  were successfully placed on the linkage map. the genetic linkage map constructed in the present study was shorter than the denser map produced by  <cit> , which had a total length of 4816 cm. the length of d. labrax linkage groups in the present study varied from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm and exhibited a positive correlation, in most cases, with the number of markers mapped per linkage group. marker-centromere frequencies ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> . these results clearly demonstrated that snp loci produced by ddrad sequencing were widely distributed in the seabass chromosomes, covering the entire chromosomal regions from proximal  to distal  regions. theoretically under the assumption of no interference , the maximum frequency of heterozygotes should be 67% at the telomeres. however out of  <dig> female heterogametic snp loci,  <dig> loci  showed heterozygote frequencies above  <dig> , indicative of crossover interference in seabass chromosomes. this phenomenon is well documented in the literature for other fish species  <cit> . similar proportion of markers  with heterozygosity exceeding  <dig>  were observed in turbot   <cit> . twenty-seven of the seabass snps showed over 90% heterozygotes in the meiotic gynogenetic family , suggesting that these could be used in individual snp assays as a smaller scale assay for discriminating between meiotic and mitotic gynogenetics. at the centromeres of the chromosomes,  <dig> loci showed less than 10% heterozygotes . we detected at least four chromosomes that appeared to be bi-armed, rather more than the 0– <dig> biarmed chromosomes detected by karyotypic analysis . the resolution of very small short chromosome arms from basic karyotyping is fairly poor, and it seems likely that applying large numbers of markers in studies such as the present one will result in the detection of more bi-armed chromosomes.

high levels of interference were reported in rainbow trout   <cit> . subsequent literature suggests that high crossover interference is a wide-spread phenomenon in fish and shellfish species . the results from the present study in general support this, with an average recombination frequency of around one per chromosome arm , see additional file 5: fig. s1). however some multiple crossovers were observed , suggesting that interference is not complete. the high marker density in this study probably helped to detect these events.

it was not possible to construct a genetic linkage map directly from the meiotic gynogenetic genotypic data in this study. it was not entirely clear if this was due to the nature of the data or the fact that linkage mapping softwares were not developed for this type of family. however, after defining linkage groups from the distribution of the markers in the sea bass genome assembly, we were able to order markers within these linkage groups with subsequent analyses, suggesting that this was a successful approach. we suggest that in any future similar studies, it would be better to produce a diploid biparental family as well as a meiotic gynogenetic family from the same parents, then the recombination data could be overlaid onto the linkage map constructed from the biparental sibs, which should contain essentially the same set of markers. this approach was followed to some extent previously in a study on rainbow trout  <cit>  , however the meiotic gynogenetic family was only used for finding intervals where centromeres were located in the duplicated genome of the rainbow trout from a limited number of loci . these authors did not describe any attempt to construct a linkage map from the meiotic gynogenetic data.

isogenic lines are likely to be a valuable resource for research on genetic improvement of complex traits in aquaculture of european seabass, as has already been demonstrated in other fish species, principally the rainbow trout  <cit> . androgenesis appears to be an attractive route towards developing isogenic lines, and should lack the complication of spontaneous meiotic gynogenetics. however, the major problems encountered in inducing androgenesis in sea bass using uv irradiation of eggs  <cit> , and indeed the paucity of publications on successful induction of androgenesis in other marine teleosts  <cit> , suggest that mitotic gynogenesis is currently the more likely successful route towards isogenic line development in this species.

CONCLUSIONS
in an effort to define telomeric markers to aid in the reliable production of isogenic lines by differentiating between meiotic and mitotic gynogenesis, we constructed a genetic linkage map and a gene-centromere map from a meiotic gynogenetic family of european seabass. this is the first genetic linkage map based on a meiotic gynogenetic family, although it was not possible to construct this de novo, so the draft genome of the sea bass was used for initial definition of the linkage groups. while there was high congruence between the genetic map from this study and the higher density map of palaiokostas et al.  <cit> , six linkage groups showed a lack of clarity in arm structure and low correlation in marker order between the dense linkage map of  <cit>  and the genome assembly. this may reflect issues in the accurate assembly of these chromosomes in this first draft sea bass genome . the data from the two linkage maps could be used in improving the genome assembly and interpreting the genomic data.

in the mapping family analysed, no paternal contribution was detected, validating the protocol used for uv inactivation of parental genome. the large number of telomeric and subtelomeric markers  in the meiotic gynogenetic family suggest that this approach should easily distinguish between meiotic and mitotic gynogenetics thus advancing/supporting future chromosomal set manipulation procedures in this species.
