BACKGROUND
cytochrome p <dig> proteins  are found in all domains of life 
 <cit>  and represent one of the largest protein families. their existence predates the emergence of oxygen-metabolizing life forms 
 <cit> . cyps are defined by the absorption of light at 450nm by the heme cofactor, and oxidize a very diverse array of metabolic intermediates and environmental compounds. cyps participate in a large number of primary, secondary and xenobiotic metabolic reactions 
 <cit> .

the evolution of cyps has been intimately intertwined with organismal adaptation to new ecological niches due to the roles of cyps in the production of metabolites critical for specific processes such as pathogenesis, the utilization of specific substrates, and/or the detoxification of xenobiotics. based on their roles in synthesizing or neutralizing toxic metabolites, many cyps are hypothesized to have evolved through the chemical warfare waged among plants, animals, insects, and microbes 
 <cit> . in fungi, several cyps have been implicated in pathogen virulence because they neutralize antifungal compounds produced by hosts 
 <cit> . expansions and diversifications of several cyp families have been associated with the evolution of fungal pathogenicity 
 <cit> . accordingly, functional and evolutionary analyses of cyps have been useful in understanding the ecological specialization and functional diversification of individual fungal taxa 
 <cit> .

the extraordinary functional and evolutionary diversity of fungal cypomes presents a major hurdle to cyp classification 
 <cit> . fungal cyps share little sequence similarity, except for a few conserved residues that are characteristic of cyps. the most conserved region is the binding domain for a heme cofactor. substrate binding regions are much more variable but may possess a signature motif. this motif is often found in conjunction with one or more binding domains such as those for cytochrome b <dig>  ferredoxin, and binding sites for the nadph cytochrome p <dig> reductase that contains fad  and fmn  
 <cit> .

another challenge in developing a comprehensive cyp classification system is the rapidly increasing number of sequenced fungal genomes. currently, more than  <dig> genomes are present in the public domain 
 <cit> , but this number is predicted to increase rapidly . the rapid influx of genome sequences calls for robust computational tools that can effectively support large-scale comparative analyses of genomes and specific gene families.

the first nomenclature/grouping schema for cyps, proposed by nebert et al. in  <dig> 
 <cit> , was based on amino acid sequence similarity. according to this schema, any two cyps with sequence identity greater than 40% belong to a single cyp family; and any two cyps with sequence identity greater than 55% belong to a subfamily. manually curated databases of cyps in multiple kingdoms based on this approach  have been maintained at 
http://drnelson.uthsc.edu/cytochromep <dig> html <cit> . these databases also serve as a central repository of cyp nomenclature. unfortunately, this schema cannot be efficiently used to curate and classify rapidly increasing cyps uncovered through genome sequencing.

the clan system approach was developed to support higher-level grouping of families identified via the sequence similarity-based schema. this approach places all cyp families with a monophyletic origin into a single clan and has been successfully applied to classify cyp families in metazoa 
 <cit>  and four fungal species 
 <cit> . for example, if new cyps had equal identity to two or more cyp families, they can be tentatively assigned to a clan in which these families belong. since the introduction of the “clan concept” in  <dig> to classify metazoan cyps 
 <cit> , additional clans in vertebrates , plants  
 <cit> , arthropods 
 <cit> , bivalves , and fungi  
 <cit>  have been identified. however, the clan classification system has become problematic for classifying the pan-fungal cypome, because the number of fungal cyps is too large to conduct phylogenetic analyses efficiently. automated clustering based on sequence similarity remains the gold standard for the rapid classification of large protein sets 
 <cit> . this approach does not require any prior knowledge and allows for rapid clustering of large protein families such as cyps.

in  <dig>  we employed an automated clustering approach to build the fungal cytochrome p <dig> database  
 <cit> . since then the number of sequenced fungal genomes has increased substantially, which necessitated the improvement of our classification system. additionally, the original fcpd classification generated several mega clusters, underscoring the need for optimizing clustering parameters.

here we present fcpd release  <dig>   with an improved cyp classification pipeline based on the modified tribe-mcl algorithm. the pipeline allowed for a larger number of cyp families to be merged into existing clans as well as supporting the discovery of potential new clans. to aid functional annotation, putative functional roles were assigned to over  <dig> clusters based on their similarity to functionally characterized fungal cyps. the families and clans are accessible through fcpd, which offers global viewing and analysis of fungal cyps.

RESULTS
identification of cyps and optimization of clustering parameters
we first extracted all proteins that contained interpro  terms associated with cyps from  <dig> genomes corresponding to  <dig> fungal and oomycete species,  <dig> other eukaryotic species, and six bacterial species  as previously described 
 <cit> . while our main focus has been on curating fungal and oomycete cyps, cyps encoded by other eukaryotic species and selected bacterial species were included to aid in comparative evolutionary studies across kingdoms. although oomycetes are fungus-like in that they produce hyphae and spores, they reside in a more basally derived eukaryotic lineage that includes chromophyte algae . however, because mycologists have traditionally studied oomycetes, we analyzed cyps from both true fungi and oomycetes. this data extraction resulted in  <dig>  cyps including  <dig>  cyps from fungi and oomycetes and  <dig>  cyps from other organisms . 
 <cit>  is accompanied by a summary of the data archived in fcpd <dig> . each cluster may have cyps from more than one phylum/subphylum. the number of clusters roughly corresponds to the number of cyp clans/families, thus illustrating the diversity of cyps in each taxon.

extracted protein sequences were clustered using an optimized protocol based on reciprocal pair-wise blastp all-against-all comparisons 
 <cit>  followed by tribe-mcl clustering 
 <cit>  . the revision of the original clustering pipeline used to build fcpd 
 <cit>  was motivated by a few factors, including the presence of many mega clusters with over  <dig> members, singlet clusters, and clusters that did not match families in nelson’s p <dig> databases. while there are no absolute “best” criteria to optimize clustering, our main goal was to achieve more uniform grouping by minimizing the fractions of very large  and singlet clusters.

three parameters  were evaluated and adjusted to optimize the performance [additional file 
2]. coverage was defined as the percentage of the query sequences matched by sequences from the database, thus the higher the coverage is, the lower is the possibility of false-positives. we tested patterns of clustering with various combinations of parameters in the optimum plane of a three-parameter space [figure 
2] and settled on the following combination: e-value = 1e- <dig>  inflation factor =  <dig>  and coverage = 60%. the coverage parameter was instrumental in filtering out many false positives that display high e-values over short regions of similarity.

cyp clustering in fcpd  <dig> 
using the optimized parameters, we categorized  <dig>  cyps into  <dig>  clusters : fungal and oomycete cyps belong to  <dig>   clusters, while the remaining clusters  contained only non-fungal cyps. although there are a few clusters that contain cyps from more than one kingdom, most clusters are kingdom-specific. all oomycete clusters consist of cyps in oomycete species with the exception of one that also contains cyps in plants, fungi, and protists. among the non-fungal clusters,  <dig> clusters contained plant cyps and  <dig> clusters contained metazoan cyps.

to validate our clustering approach and to link resulting clusters to results from previous classifications, the clusters were compared with cyp families and clans identified in previous studies 
 <cit> , which in most instances showed good concordance between fcpd clusters and known families and clans. out of  <dig> fungal cyp families identified in nelson’s p <dig> databases,  <dig> matched with the cyps in fcpd. those that did not match corresponded to cyps in species that are not currently covered in fcpd.

at the clan level,  <dig> clusters matched with  <dig> clans identified in a previous clan classification  with some clusters including multiple clans. in only three instances our clustering results suggested that two or more clans needed to be merged:  clans cyp <dig> and cyp532;  cyp <dig> and cyp530; and  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  and cyp <dig>  orphan clans identified in the previous classification 
 <cit>  were assigned to some of the non-orphan clans through our clustering. we identified  <dig> new putative clans and validated existing clans, which brought the total number of clans in fcpd to  <dig> 

as a result of this expanded clan classification,  <dig> additional cyp families were put into new and existing clans . of those, eight families that correspond to singlet fcpd clusters were classified as orphan clans. the resulting clans vary widely in size and number of cyp families included. the largest clans  contain  <dig> families each. the size distribution analysis showed that, like many other protein families 
 <cit> , cyp clusters follow a power law distribution . only  <dig> clusters with more than  <dig> members were observed. in contrast,  <dig>  clusters were comprised of a single cyp. information about individual clusters, families, and clans archived in fcpd will facilitate global analyses of fungal cyps. new cyps can be annotated using the blast search function.

wide variation of the cypome
the total number of cyps and their relative fraction within the total proteome in different kingdoms and phyla varied widely. the boxplots in figure 
3a show that plants have the largest cypome , bacteria have the smallest cypome , and fungi are placed in the middle . the potato solanum phureja has the largest cypome composed of  <dig> cyps.

the size of cypome of individual species within kingdoms also varied drastically, presumably reflective of diverse lifestyles and ecologies. the largest variation was observed in fungi and plants. in fungi, pezizomycotina and basidiomycota have the largest and most variable cypomes . the cypome of certain basidiomycota fungi such as the brown rot fungus postia placenta  and the cocoa tree pathogen moniliophthora perniciosa  are larger than typical plant cypomes. in these species, massive expansions of cyps involved in oxidizing complex hydrocarbons were observed 
 <cit> . in contrast, some basidiomycota fungi, such as puccinia graminis  and malassezia globosa , have undergone massive reductions, probably reflecting their obligatory pathogenic lifestyles. members of the chytridiomycota and oomycota also showed small cypomes. members of saccharomycotina and taphrinomycotina have the smallest cypomes among fungi .

phyletic distribution of cyp families and clans in fungi
our phyletic analysis showed an uneven distribution of cyp cluster sizes among taxa, which is consistent with extreme expansions and contractions of certain cyp families in the course of evolution. seven out of the  <dig> largest fungal-specific clusters were exclusively composed of cyps from the subphylum pezizomycotina. the most dramatic expansions were observed in pezizomycotina , agaricomycotina  and mucoromycotina . small clusters containing only species-specific cyps were especially prevalent in members of oomycota and mucoromycotina.

the five largest fungal-specific clusters in fcpd had  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> cyps, respectively. these clusters represent some of the largest cyp families in fungi . the largest cluster  contains cyps from the subphyla agaricomycotina  and pezizomycotina . in this cluster, most pezizomycotina cyps  correspond to members of family cyp <dig>  whereas  <dig> agaricomycotina cyps belong to family cyp <dig>  some members of both families are known to be involved in xenobiotic metabolism 
 <cit> . additionally, this cluster includes cyps from the wood-rotting fungi heterobasidion annosum  and postia placenta , and more than  <dig> cyps in six basidiomycete species, which suggests expansions of cyps involved in the degradation of components of the wood .

the second largest fungal-specific cluster  has cyps from saccharomycotina and pezizomycotina. it comprises the families cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  and cyp <dig> as well as a few other families involved in alkane assimilation . the third largest cluster  consists of cyps from pezizomycotina. the most dominant family in this cluster is cyp <dig>  which contains cyps predicted to function in secondary metabolism.

six clusters contain both fungal and non-fungal cyps, many of which are involved in evolutionary conserved core metabolic roles and are likely derived from common ancestral proteins. cluster  <dig> contains family cyp <dig>  one of the most conserved cyp families in fungi and beyond. the cluster has cyps from all sub-phyla of fungi, amoebozoa, and the unicellular diatom capsaspora owczarzaki as well as one cyp from the algae coccomyxa sp. cluster  <dig> includes families cyp <dig> and cyp <dig>  and cyps from all fungal taxa, actinobacteria, bacillariophyta, and the plant populus trichocarpa. cluster  <dig> includes cyps from zygomycota and blastocladiomycota as well as oomycetes, protists, and plants. cluster  <dig> includes a single family from the chytrid spizellomyces punctatus and many cyps from chordates. cluster  <dig> contains members of cyp <dig>  which are implicated in sterol biosynthesis in all fungal phyla 
 <cit> , and various cyps from amoebozoa, bacillariophyta, euglenozoa, and chordata. lastly, cluster  <dig> contains cyp <dig> family, in which fungal and bacterial cyps are clustered together. some of these families will be discussed in more detail below.

our clustering approach also revealed  <dig> phylum-specific clusters and  <dig>  cyps that did not belong to any previously defined cyp families. out of these,  <dig> were present in singlet clusters. cyp families present in individual phyla and subphyla  were also examined. five cyp families were present in all species from pezizomycotina and four families were present in all basidiomycete species, while  <dig> families were present in all species from mucoromycotina. among them, two families  were common to all taxa. the cyp <dig> family is absent in the ascomycota fungi, however all the other basal lineages have retained this family . the most parsimonious explanation is that cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  and cyp <dig> were present in the last common ancestor of all fungi. indeed, cyp <dig> is thought to be present even in early eukaryotes, and it has been hypothesized that cyp <dig> evolved from cyp <dig> 
 <cit> . on the other hand, the family cyp <dig> seems to be specific to fungi and is known to be involved in degradation of various fatty acids and hydrocarbons , allowing fungi to utilize these materials as nutrient sources. 

functional annotation and classification of cyp clusters
to assign putative functional roles to individual clusters, we conducted a comprehensive literature review for functionally characterized fungal cyps. this survey led to the identification of  <dig> cyps that had been shown to be involved in  primary metabolism ,  secondary metabolism  or  xenobiotic metabolism  . we then used blastp to search the fcpd database with these cyps as queries . a total of  <dig>  hits  were generated with the cyps involved in various primary metabolic reactions. this high number of hits is mainly due to the presence of well-conserved, house-keeping families such as cyp <dig> and cyp <dig>  which are involved in ergosterol biosynthesis 
 <cit> . additionally, we found  <dig> and  <dig> hits with those cyps involved in secondary and xenobiotic metabolism, respectively . only one family  contained cyps involved in both secondary and xenobiotic metabolism. for instance, one such cyp <dig> gene from phanerochaete chrysosporium has been predicted to function as benzoate 4-hydroxylase  and at the same time is also involved in trichothecene biosynthesis  
 <cit> . the relatively small number of hits to cyps involved in secondary metabolism suggests that many fungi might have evolved a lineage-specific repertoire of cyps to produce specific secondary metabolites.

excluding cyp <dig>  we found  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> cyp families that uniquely matched to the primary, secondary, and xenobiotic metabolism categories, respectively. these  <dig> cyp families were then used to assign putative functional roles to the respective clans. with this approach we tentatively classified a total of  <dig> clans into primary , secondary , and xenobiotic  metabolism .

detailed analysis of specific clans
selected cyp clans and families were analyzed in detail to augment and validate previous evolutionary studies 
 <cit>  and to uncover notable features.

clans  <dig> and 61
our clustering analysis fully supported families cyp <dig> and cyp <dig>  which are composed of house-keeping cyps found in almost all fungi, plants and animals. cyp <dig> is a lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase involved in 14-demethylation of sterol precursors, and this demethylation step is common throughout all organisms 
 <cit> . to better understand its evolution, we constructed a phylogenetic tree with members of cyp51s from fungi, the early opisthokonts and other single-celled eukaryotes .

most yeast species have a single cyp <dig> gene, whereas most pezizomycotina species have two genes with the exception of fusarium species and aspergillus carbonarius . basidiomycetes also have a single gene with the exception of postia placenta and coprinus cinereus . rhizopus oryzae, allomyces macrogynus, and fragilariopsis cylindrus have two cyp <dig> genes and no cyp <dig> genes. this is consistent with the view that the cyp <dig> gene became duplicated very early in fungal evolution and then one of the duplicates may have given rise to cyp <dig> 
 <cit> .

cyp <dig> gene is a  <dig> sterol desaturase that carries out one of the last reactions in the ergosterol metabolism pathway. the phylogenetic analysis of cyp <dig>  revealed the presence of a single gene in all yeasts and all basidiomycetes except p. placenta . most ascomycota species have at least two genes with the exception of pneumocystis carinii, as well as the basidiomycetes puccinia graminis, and melampsora laricis-populina, all three of which do not have a cyp <dig> gene. the absence of cyp <dig> genes in these species could be due to their obligate lifestyle, wherein they may utilize essential sterols from the plant/animal hosts.

clans  <dig> and 68
clans cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> consist of cyps that belong to the secondary metabolism category. cyp <dig> has been found to catalyze the epoxidation reaction during the biosynthesis of the mycotoxin trichothecene, as well as during radicicol biosynthesis . cyp <dig> carries out the c- <dig> oxygenation reaction during trichothecene biosynthesis  and the oxidation reaction during the biosynthesis of the plant hormone gibberellin 
 <cit> . the phylogenetic trees of cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> reveal multiple recent duplications and expansions . these clans are absent in ascomycete yeasts and basidiomycete species, suggesting that they might have emerged in the ancestor of the pezizomycotina.

among members of the pezizomycotina, there is a wide variation in the number of cyps in clans cyp <dig> and cyp <dig>  the coccidioides species have just one cyp <dig> gene, whereas dothideomycetes and aspergillus species have 8– <dig> genes for cyp65s and 3– <dig> genes for cyp68s. dothideomycetes have on average at least 5– <dig> more genes than other fungi, which is consistent with their secretion of diverse host-selective toxins . many of these hsts are products of secondary metabolism pathways.

the highest number of cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> clan members is seen in magnaporthe oryzae, colletotrichum graminicola and colletotrichum higginsianum . all three fungi form appresoria  to enter the plant cell. expression studies have demonstrated that secondary metabolism pathways are active during the infection process 
 <cit> , suggesting that the increased number of cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> family members in these fungi might be linked to their pathogenicity.

clan 505
cyp <dig> members are fatty acid hydroxylases that carry out the subterminal omega hydroxylation of fatty acids, a step required for the use of fatty acids as an energy source. it was hypothesized that cyp <dig> in fungi has evolved from the bacterial cyp450bm <dig> via a horizontal gene transfer  event 
 <cit> . this hypothesis is supported by the fact that both types have a fused nadph cpr domain .

to test this hgt hypothesis, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of this clan . contrary to the hypothesis, the tree topology  suggests an ancient origin of this clan in eukaryotes and subsequent losses in certain lineages. the earliest members of the clan seem to be present in the unicellular opisthokonts capsaspora owczarzaki, streptomyces species of bacteria and the unicellular algae fragilariopsis cylindrus. there are at least two genes for cyp <dig> in most fungi, while early eukaryotes f. cylindrus and allomyces macrogynus have 4– <dig> genes, suggesting an early increase in its copy number and subsequent gene losses. cyp505s are absent in ascomycete yeasts. among members of the pezizomycotina, a. flavus and podospora anserina have five genes, and m. grisea has four genes. basidiomycetes also have at least two genes with the white rot fungus p. chrysosporium containing six genes. it has been hypothesized 
 <cit>  that cyp <dig> is used by plant-associated fungi to degrade plant cuticle which is synthesized by in-chain hydroxylation of fatty acids 
 <cit> .

clan 52
cluster  <dig> contained all the cyps belonging to clan cyp <dig>  the highest numbers of cyp <dig> proteins  are seen in aspergillus flavus, a. niger cbs  <dig> , trichoderma virens gv29- <dig>  botrytis cinerea and magnaporthe oryzae. talaromyces stipitatus and penicillium marneffei have  <dig> and  <dig> members of cyp <dig>  respectively. in m. oryzae, cyp <dig> is upregulated during the penetration of the plant cuticle, which is made up of hydrocarbons 
 <cit> . similar processes could be happening in b. cinerea and a. flavus, both of which are pathogenic to plants as well as trichoderma virens gv29- <dig> , t. reesei , and t. atroviride  that are known to penetrate the fungal cell wall 
 <cit>  as well as plant roots 
 <cit> . cyp <dig> genes are found in candida species that are known to metabolize alkanes and other hydrocarbons, but are absent in saccharomyces cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces pombe <cit> . there were as many as  <dig> cyp <dig> proteins encoded by yarrowia lipolytica, but there were no cyp <dig> proteins in basidiomycetes. all of these species might be using their cyp <dig> repertoire to support these processes, and expansion of the cyp <dig> family in these ascomycete fungi may allow efficient metabolism of various hydrocarbon compounds. we built a neighbor-joining tree to look at their evolutionary relationships . the most parsimonious evolutionary scenario suggests that the family evolved in the ancestor of budding yeasts but was lost in the lineage including s. cerevisiae but then expanded in the pezizomycotina.

clan  <dig> and clan 504
cyp <dig> is a benzoate-para-hydroxylase enzyme that was first discovered in aspergillus niger <cit> . this benzoate detoxification occurs via the beta-ketoadipate pathway 
 <cit> , which is present in many soil microbes that degrade aromatic compounds, some of which are released by plants 
 <cit> . although benzoate detoxification appears to be the main function of members of this cyp group, some of them have also been found to exhibit o-demethylation activity 
 <cit> . clan  <dig> is a single family clan in cluster  <dig> and contains  <dig> cyps. this family is absent in ascomycete yeasts. a wide variation in its size was observed in the wood-decaying fungi postia placenta , pleurotus osteratus  and phanerochaete chrysosporium . considering their proposed role in degrading plant-based aromatic compounds that are released by the plants into the soil or that might be present as a part of the dead plant material, this wide variation is puzzling. they are also present in several plant-pathogenic fungi such as fusarium oxysporum , f. graminearum , puccinia graminis , moniliophthora perniciosa , cochliobolus heterostrophus , and botrytis cinerea , suggesting the possibility that the benzoate degrading activity may contribute to pathogenesis.

clan cyp <dig> includes cyps that are involved in phenylacetate catabolism 
 <cit> . specifically, they are involved in the ortho-hydroxylation of phenylacetate, which is a precursor in penicillin production. like clan  <dig>  this clan is a single-family cluster . the family is found in many saprophytic species as well as a number of basidiomycetes fungi that can degrade phenol derivatives as a source of carbon 
 <cit> . this family is also present in a number of human and plant-pathogenic fungi like stagonospora nodorum , c. heterostrophus , penicillium marneffei , fusarium oxysporum , f. graminearum  and f. solani . both cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> family members were found to be upregulated during cuticle infection by insect pathogenic fungi metarhizium anisopliae  and m. acridum  
 <cit> . it was suggested that in these insect pathogens these cyp families carry out detoxification of insect released phenylacetate 
 <cit> .

clan 533
this clan forms one of the largest fungal clusters. it contains  <dig> cyp families; two of them are specific to the ascomycota,  <dig> are specific to the basidiomycota, and three  are common to both. the three common families form clan  <dig> in the previous classification by deng et al. 
 <cit> . cyps belonging to the cyp <dig> family seem to be involved in secondary metabolism since they show similarity to cyps involved in the biosynthesis of sterigmatocystin and aflatoxin. the largest basidiomycete-specific family in this clan is the cyp <dig> family that has  <dig> members, some of which have been found to be involved in the degradation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons  
 <cit> . many cyps in this cluster exist in the brown rot fungus postia placenta , the forest pathogen heterobasidion annosum , the mushrooms coprinus cinereus  and pleurotus osteratus , the white rot fungus phanerochaete chrysosporium , and the dry rot fungus serpula lacrymans . among ascomycetes, aspergillus flavus , a. oryzae , a. niger , fusarium verticillioides , f. oxysporum , f. graminearum , and trichoderma virens , all of which are known for their capability of producing various secondary metabolites, have the largest numbers of cyp <dig> members. the presence of cyp <dig>  and cyp <dig>  in this cluster indicate that these families might have evolved from a common ancestral cyp family.

cyps in mucoromycotina, blastocladiomycota and oomycota
most cyps from mucoromycotina, blastocladiomycota and oomycota clustered separately into taxa-specific clusters. cyps from mucoromycotina were divided into  <dig> clusters, which include three clusters that also included non-fungal cyps  and  <dig> clusters only having mucoromycotina cyps. one of the clusters  had cyps from mucoromycotina as well as cyps from oomycota, blastocladiomycota, protists, plants, and ustilago maydis . plant cyps in this cluster  included enzymes shown to modify fatty acid and alkane substrates. this pattern suggests a very ancient origin of this alkane metabolizing cyp clan, potentially predating the split of the eukaryotes into unikonts, plantae and chromalveolates. in this scenario, this family might have been lost in most fungi. lateral transfer of the cyp family from plants to early fungi could be another possibility, especially considering the narrow distribution of these cyps in fungi at the ancestral nodes of the fungal species tree. lastly, it is also possible that convergent evolution could have driven the cyps to perform similar functions in both plants and fungi. blastocladiomycota cyps also exhibited a pattern similar to those seen in mucoromycotina. only three clusters contain cyps from other phyla. interestingly, there are no cyp61s in blastocladiomycota, possibly indicating their loss of ability to synthesize ergosterol. fourteen clusters contain only blastocladiomycota cyps. most cyps from mucoromycotina and blastocladiomycota exhibited low similarity to cyps in nelson’s p <dig> databases.

as expected, oomycota cyps mostly formed oomycete-specific clusters  with the exception of cluster  <dig>  which also contains cyps from basidiomycota, zygomycota  and plants. there are  <dig> cyps that do not show any significant similarity to cyps in nelson’s p <dig> databases. only four known cyp families  were identified. members of cyp <dig>  showed 30% identity  to cyp <dig> in arabidopsis thaliana, which is involved in fatty acid metabolism. similarly, those in cyp <dig>  showed 34% identity  to fatty acid omega hydroxylases  in medicago truncatula. members of cyp <dig>  and cyp <dig>  also showed similar levels of identity to fatty acid hydroxylases. thus, most cyps in oomycete species, which encode about 30– <dig> cyps, could be involved in fatty acid metabolism. our observations are consistent with previous studies that predicted the absence of extensive secondary metabolism clusters  in oomycetes 
 <cit> .

cyps with unusual phyletic profiles
analysis of several clusters that contained cyps from more than one kingdom revealed patterns suggesting rapid birth–death evolution, or alternatively, horizontal gene transfer , which has been implicated as a contributing factor in fungal adaptation to new ecological niches 
 <cit> . however, in most cases, due to low taxon sampling, it would be premature to make any firm conclusions.

our analysis of clusters  <dig> and  <dig> exhibited patterns similar to previously published examples of hgt in fusarium oxysporum <cit>  and phanerochaete chrysosporium <cit> . cluster  <dig> contains cyp55s from p. chrysosporium, pezizomycotina, and the bacterial genus streptomyces. similarly, cluster  <dig>  contains cyps from bacteria, plants, early opisthokonts, and fungi. cluster  <dig> has  <dig> cyp <dig> members including five cyps of mucoromycotina species that show high sequence similarity to bacterial cyps. phylogenetic analysis showed two branches, one with only fungal cyps and the other with bacterial and mucoromycotina cyps , which suggests the possibility of lateral gene transfer.

clan cyp <dig>  is composed of  <dig> intron-less cyps including four from aspergillus spp. and three from microsporum spp. the cyps from a. fumigatus were predicted to be involved in helvolic acid biosynthesis 
 <cit> , and their orthologs in the insect pathogens metarhizium anisopliae and m. acridum are expressed during cuticle infection 
 <cit> . the observed phyletic pattern is consistent with massive gene loss in most fungi, but hgt from nitrogen-fixing bacteria that also synthesize helvolic acid 
 <cit>  cannot be completely excluded.

clan cyp <dig>  contains  <dig> cyps mainly from plant pathogens and epiphytes . some members share sequence similarity with cyps involved in the biosynthesis of camptothecin 
 <cit> , an alkaloid secreted by plants that have anti-cancer properties. this cluster includes two homologs from fusarium solani, with one of them identified as a pseudoparalog 
 <cit> . this pseudoparalog lies on a dispensable chromosome in f. solani, and shows similarity to cyp <dig> family members from plants 
 <cit> . other cyps in the cluster also show similarity to plant cyps belonging to clan cyp <dig>  our phylogenetic analysis  suggests potential hgt from plants to fungi intimately associated with plants 
 <cit> .

we also analyzed clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  which contain  <dig> and  <dig> cyps from plant-pathogenic and plant-associated fungi, respectively. while cluster  <dig> has cyps from four different basidiomycota fungi, cluster  <dig> has seven cyps from puccinia graminis. all the cyps in these clusters belong to families cyp <dig> and cyp <dig>  respectively and share significant similarity to cyp <dig> and cyp <dig>  families that are involved in the metabolism of complex hydrocarbons such as fatty acids and in the biosynthesis of plant cutin 
 <cit> . the phylogenetic analysis  suggests that clan cyp <dig> in plants and families cyp5025/cyp <dig> in fungi have arisen from a common ancestral cyp family.

finally, three cyps from fusarium species  showed sequence similarity to bacterial p450rhf proteins 
 <cit> . the rhf cyps represent the first known example of bacterial cyps that receive electrons from a fmn- and fe/s- reductase fused to them 
 <cit> . no other fungus has been observed to have this type of cyp. the result of our phylogenetic analysis  is consistent with the presence of this type of cyp in the ancestor of f. oxysporum and f. graminearum.

CONCLUSIONS
here we present a new version of fcpd, which holds  <dig>  cyps from  <dig> fungal and oomycete species in addition to cyps from selected species in other kingdoms. there is no perfect solution to clustering proteins as diverse and numerous as cyps, but we believe that our clustering pipeline provides an improved cyp classification system. using this pipeline we have identified new clans and families. to our knowledge, this study represents the most extensive classification of fungal and oomycete cyps, which will facilitate functional annotation and classification of putative cyps encoded by newly sequenced fungal and oomycete genomes. the fcpd  <dig>  pipeline can efficiently group cyps from newly sequenced genomes and help predict their functions.

the cyp number for certain species may have been exaggerated due to the following factors:  heterozygous alleles of the same gene, and  artifacts created during genome assembly and annotation being counted as unique genes. some species are diploids with certain degrees of heterozygosity between alleles, which might have been counted as unique genes, thus increasing the total number of cyps. in some cases gene fragments  have been counted as separate genes. rectifying these potential artifacts manually is challenging due in part to the very large size of data present in fcpd and also due to the difficulties of validating individual data.

there is also cyp redundancy in the database due to the presence of cyp sequences from multiple strains of several species. in the case of postia placenta, which encodes the largest cypome among fungi, we identified eight alleles that have been counted as separate genes. similar analysis of the solanum phureja cypome  showed four alleles that had been identified as distinct genes. because the database includes data from  <dig> strains from  <dig> species, there is redundancy in the cyp data. we caution that users should keep these caveats in mind when using the database.

our analysis of fungal cyps points to a number of notable evolutionary patterns. gene duplication and subsequent modification of the duplicated copies seem to have played a major role in creating the observed cyp diversity. the cyp family expansions seen in some of the basidiomycetes like postia placenta, heterobasidion annosum, and phanerochaete chrysosporium as well as ascomycetes such as magnaporthe oryzae, stagonospora nodorum, fusarium solani, and f. oxysporum may have led to these fungi adapting to their current ecological niches. although massive cyp gene losses probably underpin unusual phyletic profiles, horizontal gene transfer as a mechanism cannot be completely discounted. the curated cyp dataset in fcpd  <dig>  provides a solid foundation for in-depth studies on myriad evolutionary patterns, which will contribute to understanding fungal evolution.
