BACKGROUND
the human face is one of the most familiar and salient stimuli in our visual environment. being able to tell apart individual faces , regardless of their familiarity, is critical for adequate social interactions. today there is an enormous amount of research carried out to understand the mechanisms of face perception, and a large proportion of studies rely on individual face discrimination measures. yet, there is still no good understanding of the process of individual face discrimination, and many issues regarding this process remain debated .

an important issue concerns the contribution of low-level visual cues to individual face discrimination: to what extent is this process sensitive to changes in low-level properties such as stimulus illumination, contrast, position, or size? in particular, size of a visual stimulus such as a face is an important factor, since human observers are exposed to faces across a wide range of sizes, sometimes simultaneously . moreover, unlike other low-level manipulations such as variable stimulus positions in the visual field, which trigger eye movements and are associated with attentional and visual lateralization biases, stimulus size is a property that is relatively easy to manipulate and to control in an experimental setting.

single-cell recordings in the monkey infero-temporal cortex have emphasized size invariance of the selective response to particular shapes, including faces . in humans, fmri studies have shown that repetition suppression - the rapid reduction of neural responses caused by the repetition of a given stimulus – for individual faces resists changes of stimulus size in high level visual areas . event-related potential studies have also shown modulation of the occipito-temporal face-sensitive n <dig> component  as well as the following n250r component  <cit> , following face identity repetition across changes of stimulus size . however, to our knowledge, only two studies, using fmri, have compared individual face repetition effects across size changes .

these studies have reported partly inconsistent results. in the first study, repetition suppression effects in high-level face-selective areas did not differ when face stimulus size was constant or varied within a block  <cit> . yet, most recently, increased repetition suppression effects were found in the same functional areas for unfamiliar faces presented at a constant size  <cit> . however, in the latter study  <cit> , 100% size faces were used in the condition with no size variation, while equally large and smaller stimulus sizes were used in the size variation condition. thus, the effects of absolute stimulus size versus discrimination across size changes could not be dissociated. most importantly, to date, there is no report of a systematic  test of the effect of size variation on the amplitude of neural responses reflecting individual face discrimination, or even high-level visual discrimination in general.

in the present study, our goal was to parametrically test the effect of size variation on neural responses to faces, controlling for absolute stimulus size, and isolating the effect of size variation on the basic response to a face stimulus from its effect on an individual face discrimination response. faces constitute an ideal type of stimulus to address this issue because the human brain is not only good at categorizing a given stimulus as a face but, as mentioned above, is also especially adept at individualizing exemplars within the category .

a parametric test of the effect of size variation on individual face discrimination requires a sensitive approach, for which the neural response of interest can be identified and quantified objectively. for this reason, we used the approach of fast periodic visual stimulation , which results in periodic electrophysiological responses on the human scalp defined as steady-state visual evoked potentials   <cit> . over recent years, this approach has been developed to identify robust electrophysiological signatures of individual face discrimination objectively  and rapidly  , with optimal frequency rates peaking at about  <dig> hz  <cit> .

most recently, liu-shuang et al.  <cit>  used fpvs to measure the discrimination of individual faces by presenting a sequence of identical face stimuli at a fast periodic rate  and introducing different  face stimuli at a slower periodic rate within the sequence . in this study, a robust individual face discrimination response was recorded over the right occipito-temporal cortex, specifically at the oddball frequency rate  and its harmonics .figure  <dig> 
experimental design. a) an illustration of the fast periodic oddball stimulation during eeg recording: a base face  is presented  <dig> times followed by a different oddball face  during each trial, thus there are  <dig> embedded frequencies: at a rate of  <dig>  hz facial images are presented  and at a rate of  <dig>  hz a face with a different identity is shown . b) varying image size conditions as used in the present study . please see also the additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for short movie clips. all variations were implemented in  <dig> steps, thus the number of possible size changes across the conditions was equal. during each trial the order of size variations was random.



this periodic oddball stimulation, with two embedded periodic frequency rates  carries important advantages for measuring individual face discrimination: within a few minutes of stimulation, it provides high signal-to-noise ratio  responses in the eeg that are objective, implicit , and easily quantified  <cit> . moreover, with this approach, the oddball response is an individual face discrimination response in itself, and thus it can be quantified in each condition without a separately recorded baseline condition in which the exact same face is repeated  <cit> . finally, and importantly, there is strong evidence that this individual face discrimination response reflects high-level visual processes: it is largely reduced following face inversion and contrast-reversal, two manipulations that largely preserve low-level visual features but impair behavioral performance at individual face discrimination .

here, in order to test the effect of size variation on individual face discrimination, we used the paradigm of liu-shuang et al.  <cit>  with a parametric size variation manipulation: from  <dig> to 80% stimulus size variation using a 2: <dig> ratio scale from 10% . critically, absolute size of stimulation was constant across conditions , so that differences in the amplitude of the oddball response across conditions could be entirely associated to interstimulus size variation.

RESULTS
frequency domain analysis
grand-averaged spectra averaged across all electrodes showed clear responses at the  <dig>  hz stimulation frequency , indicating successful synchronization to the visual stimulation. overall, the response at  <dig>  hz had a medial occipital topography, peaking either on electrode oz or pooz, depending on the condition . a similar topography was previously reported when presenting the same face at a base frequency rate . with the increase of image size variation, the response increased over the medial occipital region and also spread to the  occipito-temporal region. similarly, the activation over the right occipito-temporal region also increased with the increase of image size change variation .figure  <dig>

data were analyzed with repeated measures anova with factors: image size variation  and roi  separately for the two frequencies . if mauchly’s test of sphericity was significant, a greenhouse-geisser correction for degrees of freedom was applied.

base frequency
a main effect of size variation, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  ηp2 = . <dig>  reflected the  <dig>  hz response increase with the increase of image size variations. simple contrasts revealed that the response was significantly higher for 80% size variation compared to 0% image size variation, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  ηp2 = .40; compared to 10% image size change, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  ηp2 = . <dig> and compared to 20% image size variations, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  ηp2 = . <dig>  but did not differ compared to 40% of image size variations, f  =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  ηp2 = . <dig> 

the main effect of roi did not reach significance, f = . <dig>  p = . <dig>  however, the interaction between roi and size variation was significant, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  ηp2 = . <dig>  due to a larger increase of the response over the right occipito-temporal region than over the medial occipital region . to further explore this interaction, two anovas with image size variation as a within subject factor for each roi separately were evaluated. while there was a significant effect of size variation for the right occipito-temporal region, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  ηp2 = . <dig>  this effect was not significant for the medial occipital region, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  moreover, a bootstrap analysis, comparing the slopes of the function predicating the base rate amplitudes across the different image size variations, revealed that the slope was steeper for the right occipito-temporal region  than for the medial occipital region . indeed, the slope for the right occipito-temporal region fell outside the confidence interval of the medial occipital region .

oddball frequency 
the anova revealed a main effect of size variation, f =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  ηp2 = . <dig>  simple contrasts suggested that the amplitude values were significantly smaller for 80% image size variations compared to 0% image size variation, f =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  ηp2 = . <dig>  compared to 10% image size variations, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  ηp2 = . <dig> and compared to 20% image size variations, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  ηp2 = . <dig>  there was also a main effect of roi, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  ηp2 = . <dig>  indicating a larger response over the right occipito-temporal region  than over the medial occipital region .

these two main effects were further qualified by a significant interaction between size variation and roi, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  ηp2 = . <dig>  suggesting a larger decrease in amplitude over the right occipito-temporal region than over the medial occipital region. to further explore this interaction, for each roi, separate anovas with image size variation were evaluated. although the main effect of size variation was significant for both regions  =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  ηp2 = . <dig>  and the medial occipital region, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  ηp2 = .31), this effect was stronger for the right occipito-temporal region than for the medial occipital region . again, a supplementary bootstrap analysis revealed that the slope of the function predicating the oddball frequency amplitudes across the different image size variations was steeper for right occipito-temporal region  than for medial occipital region . the slope for right occipito-temporal region fell outside the confidence interval of the medial occipital region .

time domain
the time domain analysis highlighted three components following the change of facial identity . importantly, these components cannot be directly related to standard event-related potential  components because they already reflect the difference between a base face and the oddball faces . the first component was positive, peaking at about  <dig> ms post-stimulus. it was significantly different from zero  between  <dig> and  <dig> ms post-stimulus only for the condition with no size change and was characterized with a bilateral occipito-temporal topography . although, this component was present in the 10% condition as well, it was attenuated and did not reach significance based on the defined criterion. the second component, a negativity starting to be significantly different from zero at about  <dig> ms post-stimulus and reaching its peak at 230- <dig> ms, was evident for all conditions. this component was distributed over the occipito-temporal region, with clear right hemisphere dominance. in this time window, a positivity over central sites was also apparent. after approximately  <dig> ms post-stimulus , a third occipito-temporal positive component, with a stronger response over the right hemisphere, was significant in all conditions. all of these components contribute to the robust discrimination response quantified in the frequency-domain as the sum of the oddball harmonics.figure  <dig>

discussion
several interesting observations were made regarding the effect of image size manipulation on the periodic electrophysiological. with the increase of the image size variation, we observed an increased response over the regions of interest for the base rate while a reduced response was obtained at the oddball  frequency. this dissociation highlights the different processes behind these two responses, as both the base and oddball rate undergo the same image size variations. furthermore, a complementary time-domain analysis revealed several components manifesting the system’s response when discriminating facial identity.

the effect of size variation on the base rate periodic response
overall, changing size at every stimulation cycle does not reduce the basic periodic eeg response, i.e., the base rate ssvep, which reflects the response generated by the periodic appearance and disappearance of the same face stimulus against a uniform background, roughly  <dig> times per second. in fact, this response slightly increases over the medial occipital cortex, where the ssvep is measured in many studies with low-level, and, even more rarely, with high-level, visual stimuli , and increases relatively more over high-level visual areas .

an increased response with changes of stimulus size likely reflects reduced low-level repetition suppression/adaptation effects. image size change eliminates strict pixelwise stimulus repetition effects for populations of neurons and, thus, reduces repetition effects due to image-based cues. however, what fpvs measures is the common response to every stimulus in a stimulation sequence. the response of low-level visual areas  is due to the rapid periodic stimulation of the same population of neurons. thus, when changing stimulus size at every cycle, only a subset of neurons, those coding for the smallest stimulus size , are recruited at every stimulation cycle. populations of neurons coding for perifoveal information, beyond this smallest face size, are recruited at non-periodic rates and should not contribute to the response. thus, in low-level visual areas the advantage provided by the reduced repetition suppression effect may be counterbalanced by a weaker periodic response when changing stimulus size. therefore the periodic response in low-level visual areas increases only slightly with increasing size variations.however, in high-level visual areas, populations of neurons have larger receptive fields, and thus are more likely to generate a response at every stimulation cycle, even when the stimulus size changes between stimulation cycles. thus, responses in high-level visual areas fully benefit from the reduced repetition suppression effects due to the change of size at every stimulation cycle. it follows that a random change of stimulus size at every cycle of fpvs increases the relative contribution of high-level visual areas as compared to low-level visual areas .

this is an important observation for fpvs studies using high-level visual stimuli. in such studies, the exact same image is usually presented at every cycle . although the findings of these studies are certainly not questioned by our observations, these observations nevertheless suggest that varying a simple factor such as stimulus size  is not detrimental for the magnitude of the ssvep response over low-level visual regions and  can increase the relative contribution of high-level visual regions to the recorded response, possibly increasing the sensitivity of the paradigm.

note that a similar effect of image size change should be expected if other high-level visual stimuli are used. since the base rate response reflects the response to the visual pattern of stimulation, it does not require a specific expertise at individuating members of the category and, thus, size variations of other visual stimuli would also lead to a decreased response suppression/adaptation. however, these conclusions may only be valid for a specific range of stimulation frequencies. here we used  <dig> hz as a base rate frequency because this rate provides the largest response for faces over occipito-temporal areas  <cit> . however, at frequency rates of about  <dig> hz and beyond, the scalp topography focuses over medial occipital sites and the contribution of high-level areas may be severely limited, so that introducing a size variation between the periodically repeated stimuli may not increase their contribution  <cit> .

the effect of size variation on individual face discrimination responses
as shown previously  <cit> , the presentation of an oddball face every five faces produced a clear oddball response, indexing individual face discrimination. the exact nature of the mechanisms triggering this oddball response is unclear  <cit>  and could be similar to discrimination response as a result of detection of change  <cit> , predictive coding  <cit>  or release from adaptation  <cit> . nevertheless, it is difficult to relate the oddball response obtained with fpvs to transient erp components elicited during presentation of standard  and deviant stimuli. for example, the mmn  is a negativity evoked when a current stimulus input mismatches a memory representation in the sensory system formed by the preceding stimulus sequence . the direct comparison between these two responses is challenging as there are important differences between the paradigms and the two kinds of responses. for instance, while the visual mmn in response to deviant stimuli is reduced in a fixed compared to a randomized oddball sequence  <cit> , a periodic repetition of the oddball is required here in order to identify clear oddball responses in the frequency domain. moreover, while the negativity of an mmn emerges only following a deviant – standard subtraction, such a subtraction is unnecessary in the present paradigm: the obtained waveform is already a differential response between the base face and the oddball face  <cit> , and contains several differential components spread over time .

the individual face discrimination response, as reflected in the oddball response to faces, was dominant over the right occipito-temporal cortex. this finding replicates previous observations  <cit>  obtained with a 40% image size variation, and generalizes it to conditions in which the size variation is either absent or negligible, or very large. despite this replication, size variation had a dramatic impact on the magnitude of the individual face discrimination response over the right occipito-temporal cortex. at these electrode sites, this response was largest when face size did not change, then equally large for  <dig> and 20% size variation, and then further reduced for  <dig> and 80% size variations , an observation which is interesting at two levels at least.

first, the contrast between the effect of size variation on the base rate response and the oddball rate response, at the same right occipito-temporal location, is striking: the exact same manipulation – size variation - increases the base rate response while it decreases the oddball rate response, showing that these responses truly reflect different neural processes . while the base rate response reflects the contrast between the same face and a uniform background, the oddball rate response reflects the contrast between the frequent face stimulus and the different face identities appearing at every five stimulation cycles. previously it has been shown that the base rate response can be unaffected by changes such as inversion or contrast-reversal, while the oddball rate response is largely reduced following these manipulations  <cit> . here, the dissociation is even more striking, as our size variation manipulation shows that one kind of response can be increased while the other can be simultaneously decreased over the same electrode sites.

second, there seem to be two steps in the reduction of the oddball response with size variation . the response reduction from 0% to 10%/20% size variation is the most dramatic because it appears to reflect not only a quantitative decrease but also a qualitative reduction of the response, as suggested by the time-domain analysis and the eeg topographical maps. indeed, when there is no change in image size, there is a component associated with individual face discrimination, peaking as early as  <dig> ms following stimulus onset . given that the face stimulus is only at full contrast after half a cycle at  <dig>  hz , this component could probably have an estimated latency of about  <dig> ms, an extremely early latency for individual face discrimination responses. although this component is localized over the occipito-temporal cortex, it is bilateral, with no evidence of a right dominance. the absence of this component for the other conditions and the lack of right hemispheric dominance suggest that it reflects the contribution of image-based, or pictorial, cues to individual face discrimination. note that by pictorial cues, we do not mean exclusively a pixelwise contribution that is independent of the nature of the stimulus, or part of this stimulus, but the recovery from suppression of activity due to the repetition of the exact same face image, which may essentially be a bottom-up process from posterior to anterior visual regions. similar to these results, in a recent fmri study  <cit>  a larger repetition suppression effect was found for same size unfamiliar images. interestingly, this effect disappeared when familiar  faces were presented.

the second and third components identified in the time-domain also look qualitatively different when there is no size variation: compared to the conditions with size variations, the second component is weaker over the right occipito-temporal cortex and increased over medial parietal sites, while the third component is very large but widely distributed over all posterior sites, including medial-occipital sites . this pattern of observation suggests that in the absence of size variation between the faces presented repeatedly at the base rate, the individual face discrimination response involves low-level visual cues strictly tied to the exact image that is presented, and these cues have an effect all along the time-course of individual face discrimination. to our knowledge, previous eeg studies have not identified such effects  <cit> , which are probably revealed here thanks to the fast periodic oddball paradigm identifying directly, and with a high sensitivity, the differential response between a frequent and a rare stimulus.

however, as soon as a slight variation in stimulation size at the base rate is introduced, the first component disappears, and the subsequent two components vary only quantitatively across the  <dig> conditions . this observation suggests that the next two components – and the oddball response quantified in the frequency domain – in these size variation conditions safely index an individual face discrimination process that cannot be attributed to image-based cues, and may also involve recurrent functional processes between face-selective processes at different levels of the ventral visual stream  <cit> . more specifically, several fmri studies have found release from repetition suppression to repeated presentations of the same facial identity in two regions of ventral occipitotemporal cortex — the occipital face area  and the fusiform face area , and these effects persisted across variations in image size  <cit> .finally, in the present study, although no qualitative changes could be observed, there was a further reduction of the oddball discrimination response over the right occipito-temporal cortex from 10%/20% to 40%/80% of size variation . one hypothesis is that this effect is due to limitations in the receptive field of populations of neurons in high-level visual areas, so that some features of the large faces are not perceived, reducing the individual face discrimination response. however, this is unlikely because even the largest faces used in the present study  were well within the receptive field size of high level visual areas. a more plausible account of this observation is that some of the faces are very small in these conditions, so that facial identity might not be extracted clearly enough to be compared to large size faces, leading to a reduction of the periodic discrimination response. from a practical point of view, this observation suggests that using 10% or maximum 20% of size variation in such paradigms, and with other approaches, may be the best compromise for measuring both high level robust individual face discrimination responses, at least for unfamiliar faces.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we made several observations regarding stimulus size variation and its effect on the responses obtained with fpvs. first, random size variation of a repeated face stimulus increases the base rate ssvep response, particularly over high-level visual regions. this effect could probably be generalized to many kinds of visual stimuli and used to boost the ssvep and/or the contribution of high-level visual areas to its generation. second, size variation decreases individual face discrimination over the right occipito-temporal cortex, even for relatively small stimuli that are within the receptive field of high-level visual regions. however, even a substantial size variation  does not abolish the individual face discrimination response. third, without any variation in size, individual face discrimination responses may be contaminated by image-based cues, triggering very early  visual discrimination responses. finally, in practice, a 10-20% image size variation is recommended to capture high-level individual face discrimination responses.
