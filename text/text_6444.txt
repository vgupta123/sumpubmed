BACKGROUND
drosophila melanogaster development requires the precise coordination of multiple distinct gene regulatory mechanisms and processes within, between, and among different cell types. one such process, rna turnover, ensures that free nucleotides are salvageable for use in transcription, signalling, transport, and protein translation. rna turnover is especially important during cellularization, when all maternally deposited rnas are degraded  <cit> . yet, surprisingly, the full set of ribonucleases  and rna-binding proteins that contribute to developmentally regulated rna turnover—both maternal and zygotic rnas—remain unknown.

dis3—a 3’ to 5’ exornase and endornase—has vital, conserved roles in rna turnover and surveillance in eukaryotic cells  <cit> . a homolog of the prokaryotic rnase ii and rnase r  <cit> , dis <dig> has been proposed to be the major ribonucleolytic activity in the rna processing exosome  <cit> , a protein complex consisting of the nuclear 3’ to 5’ exoribonuclease rrp <dig>  rnase ph subunits rrp41/ski <dig>  rrp <dig>  rrp <dig>  rrp <dig>  rrp <dig> and mtr <dig>  and s <dig> domain subunits rrp <dig>  rrp <dig> and csl <dig>  <cit> . although functions of the dis <dig> rnase have been attributed to the exosome, we and others have proposed that dis <dig> and exosome subunits may individually assemble into and/or function in exosome-independent complexes  <cit> ; we call these complexes “exozymes  <cit> .” one such exozyme is a complex of dis <dig> and rrp <dig> with importin-α <dig>  although its function remains unclear  <cit> . in this regard, dis <dig> and rrp6—but no other exosome subunits—have roles in the cell cycle, presumably related to their core exosome-independent rna substrates and activities  <cit> . finally, dis <dig>  rrp <dig>  and the core exosome play non-overlapping roles in rrna, mrna, trna, and other rna species metabolism  <cit> .

despite progress towards understanding dis <dig> substrates and activities in an individual cell, we know nothing of its contributions to rna metabolism during development of a multicellular organism. this is a fundamental issue in need of clarification, as spatiotemporal control of rna deposition, expression, and turnover are central to proper ontogenesis  <cit> . supporting a role for dis <dig> in development, dis <dig> mrna is present in almost all cells in the drosophila embryo and dis <dig> protein is detectable at every stage of drosophila development  <cit> . further support comes from microarray data showing that dis <dig> depletion affects expression of developmental and neuronal transcripts in embryo-derived tissue culture cells  <cit> .

given that drosophila development and transcriptomics are well-characterized, and that the fly is a tractable genetic system, we set out to study the role of dis <dig> in rna metabolism during ontogenesis using transgenic knock down fly strains. by analyzing the appearance of staged dis3-depleted flies, the cytology of isolated fly organs, and the expression and pathways of total and specific rnas, we provide the first evidence that dis <dig> has an essential role in a metazoan.

RESULTS
generation of dis <dig> knock down flies
working in the drosophila melanogaster s <dig> tissue culture system, our group showed that the dis <dig> rnase is essential for growth and for proper rna metabolism  <cit> . we also showed that dis <dig> regulated a set of rnas that were functionally related to developmental processes. because no study has been attempted to understand the role of dis <dig> in development, we set out to address this shortcoming. to this end, we crossed a fly strain harboring a daughterless-gal <dig>  driver to a strain with a uas promoter driving a dis <dig> rnai transgene, thereby generating several dis3kd transgenic flies . following the cross, larvae were harvested at three different days to determine the level of dis <dig> protein depletion. a comparison of the wild type control flies  to the dis <dig> rnai flies  revealed that dis <dig> protein level was reduced in all three different larval stages, with greatest amount of protein depletion on the 3rd day . we used this transgenic system to address the effects of dis <dig> depletion on fly development.

dis <dig> knock down larvae are growth retarded and 2nd instar lethal
we first sought to determine whether dis <dig> depletion had any overt effects on embryo morphology or developmental timing. we isolated and examined individual embryos and larvae from control w <dig>  da-gal <dig>  and da-gal4/ <dig> flies over  <dig> days . whereas the control animals entered a period of rapid growth during the transition from the 3rd to 5th day, the da-gal4/ <dig> animals slowed down: 477% and 396% growth for the w <dig> and da-gal <dig> flies, respectively, and 50% growth for the da-gal4/ <dig> flies. further, the da-gal4/ <dig> flies stay as 2nd instar larvae for two weeks prior to exhibiting 100% lethality . most of the da-gal4/ <dig> larvae have one or more melanotic masses that are distributed throughout the organism . as these masses are cell nodules that arise due to inappropriate signalling during hematopoeisis  <cit> , these data indicate that proper dis <dig> levels are required for blood cell function and differentiation during development.

in order to confirm these phenotypes, we performed crosses with another dis <dig> rnai strain  and with other gal <dig> driver strains like tub-gal <dig> and act5c-gal <dig>  we examined larval growth, melanotic masses, and lethality of these crossed strains . all of the dis3kd flies exhibited the same phenotypes, confirming our initial results . based upon this finding and as the da-gal <dig> driver has been shown to express ubiquitously throughout development  <cit> , we performed all subsequent analyses with the da-gal4/ <dig> dis3kd flies and w <dig> wild-type  control flies.

dis <dig> knock down does not affect fly brain morphology
in our prior microarray study, we discovered several enriched dis <dig> target rnas that were related to neurogenesis  <cit> . we predicted that if dis <dig> were regulating these rnas during development, we should find dis <dig> localizing to fly brains. to test this prediction, we dissected whole brains from wt and dis3kd larvae and co-stained them with antibodies to dis <dig> and the neuronal marker protein fasciclin , a microarray-identified dis <dig> target rna. in the wt brain, both anti-dis <dig> and -fasciclin antibodies stained the whole organ; these staining patterns appeared to overlap with one another. a close-up examination of anti-dis <dig> antibody co-stain with dapi  reveals neuron-specific staining that is either cytoplasmic or nuclear; this compartment exclusivity was also seen in embryonic tissue culture cells  <cit> . although the dis3kd fly brains are half the size of wt brains, we did not detect any otherwise aberrant morphology; we also did not observe changes in anti-fasciclin antibody staining in dis3kd brains. nonetheless, we detect dis <dig> depletion as loss of anti-dis <dig> antibody staining , supporting the depletion observed with our western blotting results .

we sought to use indirect immunofluorescence as an indirect test of whether dis <dig> depletion affected general mrna metabolic pathways in brains. to this end, we explored the protein localization and levels of the neuron-specific mrna-binding factor elav . in wt brains, anti-dis <dig> and -elav antibodies exhibited non-overlapping staining patterns. in dis3kd brains, both the anti-elav antibody staining pattern and signal level were largely unaffected. our data thus suggest that dis3kd fly phenotypes are not a by-product of perturbing the localization and levels of proteins in general mrna metabolic pathways.

in prior work, we showed that dis <dig> and rrp <dig> physically interact and co-localize in s <dig> cells and are mutually required for proper localization  <cit> . to determine whether these protein partners co-localize and cooperate in flies, we stained wt fly brains with antibodies to rrp <dig> and dis <dig>  surprisingly, anti-rrp <dig> antibodies do not stain the brain lobes, whereas anti-dis <dig> antibodies do; anti-rrp <dig> antibodies stain certain brainstem portions, but this staining is not found in all brain stains . further, dis <dig> depletion did not significantly affect the anti-rrp <dig> antibody staining pattern. these observations suggest that dis <dig> and rrp <dig> may not cooperate in all drosophila tissues, consistent with the exozyme hypothesis  <cit> .

transcriptomic profiling of dis <dig> knock down flies
given the role of dis <dig> in regulating a defined subset of the s <dig> cell transcriptome, we hypothesized that dis <dig> depletion affects fly development by perturbing either the expression, processing, and/or turnover of vital developmental transcripts. to test this hypothesis in an unbiased and thorough manner, we performed rna deep sequencing  analysis of wt and dis3kd flies during development. to capture snapshots of the fly transcriptome at specific developmental stages, we divided our analysis into  <dig> time points . at the first time point , embryos were collected after flies laid eggs for  <dig> hours. for all other time points , the flies laid eggs for  <dig> hours and samples were collected after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours. we collected wt and dis3kd flies in parallel to permit comparison.

following rna extraction, purification, preparation, and deep sequencing, the raw rna-seq data was processed, quantified, and normalized, and rpkm values were calculated . from this analysis, a total of  <dig>  transcripts were mapped to the drosophila genome, including  <dig> new, previously unannotated genes. of these transcripts, the  <dig>  that had high raw read count  in at least one sample were selected for further analysis. to organize those transcripts, we generated a heatmap with the log2-transformed rpkm values for every time point .

our heatmap revealed a specific rna accumulation pattern in day  <dig> and day  <dig> dis3kd samples as compared to the wt samples . we isolated this transcript subset and generated a detailed heatmap . to determine the nature of these effects, we performed a gene ontology  enrichment study. in three go categories—“biological process,” “cellular components,” and “molecular function”—we selected the five go terms with the top p-value scores and then graphed them by both number of transcripts and fold enrichment . the highest scoring go terms in the dis3kd data set correspond to “biometabolism of metabolites,” “chemical energy,” “mitochondria,” and “membrane transporters.” notably, these go terms are unified in the phenomenon of oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting that dis <dig> may be involved in this process.

dis <dig> knock down affects early transcriptomic expression
in order to examine the broader impact of dis <dig> depletion on the drosophila transcriptome, we graphed the numbers of both increased and decreased transcripts.  these transcripts were grouped as  <dig> fold or greater change  and  <dig> fold or greater change  for each time point . dis3kd affected the largest number of rnas at early time points, with  <dig> % of the transcriptome affected in day  <dig> and  <dig> % in day  <dig> . at later time points, a smaller portion of the transcriptome is affected, with ~22% in days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and 35% on day 4; this greater effect in day  <dig> was already intimated .

in order to examine whether dis <dig> expression correlated with these stage-specific effects, we extracted the dis <dig> expression data from rna-seq for wt and rnai-depleted animals. we find that dis <dig> transcriptional pattern undulates from high expression during early embryogenesis to low levels prior to late stages of larval development . consistent with expectations, dis3kd elicits reduction of dis <dig> rna ; this reduction was further validated using quantitative real-time rt-pcr with actin as an unaffected loading control . together, the correlation between dis <dig> rna levels and depletion with robust transcriptomic effects at early time points supports an important role for dis <dig> in rna metabolism during early developmental stages.

expanding upon the initial fold change analysis , we graphed the number of 2-fold and 5-fold increased and decreased rnas at each time point in dis3kd samples . we find that on days  <dig> and  <dig>  rnas are predominantly decreased. in contrast, for day two through day five, we find equivalent numbers of increased and decreased rnas.

gene ontology analysis of transcriptomic changes due to dis <dig> knock down
in order to determine whether there is any functional specificity for dis3-mediated regulation during development, we performed go analysis on those rnas that were 5-fold increased or decreased in dis3kd samples . for that pool of rnas, we restricted our analysis to the top  <dig> go terms for each time point as judged by their p-values. for the increased rnas during the first two days of our dis3kd developmental time course, enriched go terms encompass phenomena related to cell structure and remodelling ; for the last four days, the upregulated transcripts share go terms related to extracellular sensing, stress, and metabolism . for the decreased rnas over the first two days of our dis3kd developmental time course, the enriched go terms correspond to development and differentiation as well as nucleotide metabolism ; for the last four days of our time course, the down-regulated transcripts share go terms related to cell-cell signalling, transmembrane and channel activity . although there is no unifying go term that defines a single time point, our data reveal that dis <dig> depletion causes specific effects on discrete classes of transcripts and pathways at different stages of drosophila development.

dis <dig> downregulates early expressed rnas during development
to answer the question—how does dis <dig> depletion disrupt developmental timing?—we examined early expressed rnas in our raw rna-seq data sets. we isolated the  <dig> rnas in the wt flies that are expressed at very high levels in day  <dig> and day  <dig> but decreased significantly thereafter . we then organized and presented these rnas as a heatmap for both the wt and dis3kd flies over our time course . we find two distinct effects of dis3kd on these early rnas. first, greater than 50% of the early expressed rnas were robustly downregulated in dis3kd flies in days  <dig> and  <dig>  second, those rnas that showed similar expression between the wt and dis3kd flies in days  <dig> and  <dig> persisted at high expression at day  <dig> only in the dis3kd flies. we also find a striking effect when comparing these early-expressed transcripts on day 4: one-third of the transcripts that are highly upregulated in the wt  are highly downregulated in the dis3kd flies. together, these data provide strong evidence for dis <dig> transcriptomic regulation in the embryo, at embryonic-larval transition, and at the larval-pupal transition.

to further examine confirm our rna-seq data, we selected early expressed rnas from our data set for graphical analysis. two of these, hunchback  and krüppel , encode dna-binding proteins that are known to be present in the early embryo  <cit> . the third rna is annotated but has no known function: cg <dig> . in wt flies, these transcripts express at the first  <dig> time points. in dis3kd flies, these three rnas are substantially reduced at these early time points. to independently validate the early expression of these rnas and the dis3kd effects seen by rna-seq, we performed qrt-pcr with actin as a loading control . the general trends are largely similar, with rnas detected at early time points and dis3kd eliciting their reduction. we suspect the differences between qrt-pcr and rna-seq arise from the nature of rna preparation and from the manner and efficiency of sequence detection and amplification. finally, we verified that the changes in hunchback, krüppel, and cg <dig> mrna levels were not observed in the da-gal <dig> early embryo .

analysis of exosome subunits expression during drosophila development
given the established role of dis <dig> in the rna processing exosome—and given that the exosome has vital roles in numerous rna metabolic pathways—we considered the possibility that the dis3kd changes in the developmental transcriptome might arise from perturbation of exosome subunit rna expression. to test this hypothesis, we isolated and graphically analysed the rna-seq-determined expression of rrp <dig> and core exosome subunits . while dis3kd elicits a significant knockdown of rrp <dig> rna levels at day  <dig> and  <dig>  there is no measurable effect at later developmental time points . we see a similar pattern  of dis3kd-mediated effects on rnase ph and s <dig> subunits as well , with a few subunit rnas showing decrease levels at the day  <dig> time point. these data suggest that dis3kd effects on early rna metabolism may be accentuated by impacting the expression of rrp <dig> or exosome subunit rnas.

discussion
in this study, we examine the mechanistic contributions of dis3—an evolutionarily conserved ribonuclease and a component of the major rna metabolic complex, the exosome—to drosophila development. using rnai to deplete dis <dig> rna, we demonstrate that dis <dig> is essential in a metazoan. we identify and categorize dis <dig> target rnas using rna-seq and reveal specific classes of rnas that are impacted at discrete developmental periods. we observe both the highest number of affected rnas and the greatest changes in rna expression in the embryonic and first instar larval points, indicating that dis <dig> plays important roles in regulating the early drosophila transcriptome.

when dis <dig> is depleted, flies grow more slowly, have a reduced body size in the second instar, die with smaller brains, and accumulate melanotic masses. we interpret and unify these phenotypes as a role for dis <dig> in regulating proper timing of cell cycle progression in a multi-cellular organism; that is, when dis <dig> is functionally perturbed, the cell cycle is delayed. prior work in fission yeast supports this idea, as mutation in dis <dig> leads to aneuploidy and defects in passage through mitosis  <cit> . further, we recently showed that dis <dig> disrupts timing of spindle formation and positioning and perturbs rna metabolism of critical cell cycle stage-specific rnas in budding yeast  <cit> . although it has been proposed that the dis <dig> ribonuclease activity is required for mitotic progression, the rnase domain mutant used in that study retains enzymatic activity  <cit> , perhaps due to its endonuclease activity. as we still detect dis <dig> protein in depleted flies by both western blotting and immunofluorescence, we suggest that our phenotypes  are due to diminished substrate recognition and metabolism rather than loss of rnase activity per se. we hypothesize that the ultimate phenotypic consequence of reduced dis <dig> expression is the melanotic masses, a characteristic of defective blood cell homeostasis and development  <cit> . on this note, the closest human homolog to dis <dig> is located at 13q <dig>  a chromosomal locus linked to a variety of cancers, including lymphocytic leukemia  <cit> . further, mutations in another human homolog, dis3l <dig>  have been recently shown to cause the perlman syndrome of overgrowth and wilms tumor susceptibility in the germline  <cit> . the exact mechanism by which dis <dig> perturbation elicits melanotic masses in flies is thus clearly of interest as it may be a potential model for understanding blood cell regulation specifically and tumorigenesis generally.

our work shows that dis <dig> has a prominent role in regulation of the early drosophila transcriptome. for example, dis3kd affects higher levels of rnas and shows a greater range of effects  at early time points as opposed to later ones. moreover, we find that dis3kd downregulates known early-expressed rnas in particular. because we initially expected that dis <dig> depletion would lead to more upregulated rnas, we interpret this transcriptomic downregulation to mean that dis <dig> inhibits with and/or out-competes other ribonucleases to maintain proper rna and nucleotide levels. for example, in the absence of dis <dig>  other rnases, such as rrp <dig> or the exosome, may become more active. given the surveillance roles for rrp <dig> in both yeast  <cit>  and drosophila <cit> , this is a possibility; this turnover could be post- or co-transcriptional, as drosophila rrp <dig> and the exosome occupy transcriptionally active genes  <cit> . another possibility is that dis <dig> may affect an mrna encoding a global transcriptional repressor, thus indirectly downregulating the transcriptome. an alternative interpretation—predicted by a systems theory that explicates the flow of genetic information as nested cycles  <cit> —is that the transcription cycle is sensitive to changes in nucleotide levels, and, in disrupting rna turnover, the transcription cycle slows down, ultimately affecting all supervenient cycles, especially the cell cycle. supporting this interpretation, genetic and nutrient changes that affect cell cycle timing also throw off yeast transcriptomic cycle timing  <cit> . unfortunately, our time points do not permit discrimination between effects on maternally deposited rnas and those on zygotic transcription. nonetheless, because dis <dig> has such pronounced effects on early rna stability, future studies that explore its activities during cellularization will be important to clarify our findings here.

CONCLUSIONS
we show that dis <dig> is essential for proper transcriptomic regulation during drosophila development. in this regard, this work importantly builds upon our general understanding of the regulators of—and transcriptomic changes that occur during—drosophila melanogaster development  <cit> . finally, this study sets the stage for future analyses to understand the precise contributions of dis <dig> and other ribonucleolytic enzymes to rna metabolic pathways and gene expression during metazoan development.
