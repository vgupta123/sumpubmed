BACKGROUND
enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan  in bacteria have proven to be the achille’s heel of bacteria; agents targeting this pathway  represent some of most potent antibiotics in clinical medicine  <cit> . β-lactam antibiotics inhibit these essential enzymes, causing pleiotropic toxicity of cellular physiology  <cit> . these antibiotics are the most extensively used class of antimicrobials in the world  <cit> . however, this class of powerful drugs is seldom considered for treatment of tuberculosis, a major infectious disease with an annual human toll of ~ <dig>  million morbidity and ~ <dig>  million mortality globally  <cit> . the causative agent, mycobacterium tuberculosis , is historically considered to be naturally resistant to most β-lactams due to its chromosomally encoded β-lactamase that is capable of hydrolyzing penicillin and cephalosporin subclasses of β-lactams, and the potentially limited rate of diffusion of β-lactams across the lipid rich outer layer of the mtb cell wall  <cit> .

the final step of pg biosynthesis in mtb is catalyzed by two different classes of enzymes, namely the d,d-transpeptidases  and l,d-transpeptidases . d,d-transpeptidases catalyze formation of the classical  <dig> →  <dig> linkages, where a transpeptide bond between the fourth amino acid  of one stem peptide and the third amino acid  of another is formed  <cit> . conversely, ldts catalyze the crosslinking of disaccharyl-tetrapeptide polymers by forming a transpeptide bond between the third amino acid in adjacent stem peptides thereby generating  <dig> →  <dig> crosslinkages between mdap residues  <cit> . although existence of these non-classical linkages in mtb was first reported in  <dig>  <cit> , the enzymes responsible for generating them were only recently discovered  <cit> . approximately two-thirds of the linkages in mtb pg are of  <dig> →  <dig> type and their synthesis is catalyzed by the ldts, highlighting the importance of these non-classical transpeptidases to this pathogen  <cit> .

emerging evidence suggests that carbapenems, a subclass of β-lactams, are not only poor substrates for β-lactamases, but are also uniquely able to inhibit ldts and d,d-carboxypeptidases whose activities are vital for maintaining the physiology of mtb pg . in addition to the dominant ldt, ldtmt <dig>  mtb possesses four additional sequence paralogs, which are aptly named ldtmt <dig>  ldtmt <dig>  ldtmt <dig>  and ldtmt <dig>  <cit> . mtb lacking ldtmt <dig> is severely attenuated for growth, virulence, has deformed cell walls and exhibits an increased susceptibility to β-lactams  <cit> . these phenotypes are further aggravated in mtb lacking both ldtmt <dig> and ldtmt <dig>  <cit> . loss of ldtmt <dig> compromises cell wall integrity leading to increased susceptibility to osmotic stress, crystal violet, and select carbapenems  <cit> .

the structures of ldtmt <dig> bound to a pg stem fragment   <cit>  or meropenem , and very recently adducts with doripenem and a series of evolved carbapenems with new c <dig> side chains  <cit> , and faropenem   <cit>  have been reported. structures of its paralogs, including apo-ldtmt <dig> and an imipenem-adduct structure of ldtmt <dig>  <cit> , the apo- and meropenem-adduct structures of ldtmt <dig>  <cit>  have also been reported. these data have provided structural and mechanistic insights about this family of enzymes, as well as details about the mechanisms of inactivation by carbapenem antibiotics.

the structure of the pg-ldtmt <dig> complex shows a dipeptide fragment of a pg stem peptide bound to the outer of two connecting cavities that flank the catalytic site coordinated by conserved residues of this ldt family , x represents any residue, and h is any hydrophobic residue). the positioning of the bound pg fragment is consistent with a transpeptidation process in which donor and acceptor stem peptide substrates alternatively bind to the same outer cavity, and key equivalent d-alanyl groups are recognized by ldt motif residues  <cit> . a transpeptidation process in which the donor and acceptor substrates enter the catalytic site from inner and outer cavities, respectively, has also been proposed  <cit> .

biapenem, an injectable, and tebipenem, an orally bioavailable carbapenem, are newer carbapenems with broad-spectrum activity and are often considered as the last resort to treat bacterial infections that are not amenable to other drug regimens. both biapenem and tebipenem exhibit potent in vitro activity against mtb  <cit> . a recent report demonstrating efficacy of biapenem in a mouse model of tuberculosis  <cit>  opens the possibility of repurposing carbapenems for the treatment of tuberculosis. in this study, we provide the molecular interactions of biapenem and tebipenem with ldtmt <dig> and propose a mechanism for the formation and decomposition of the adducts. we also discuss strategies for developing new antimicrobials by leveraging the carbapenem scaffold that inactivates ldtmt <dig>

esi-tof mass spectrometry analysis
samples were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography -high resolution ms with a waters acquity h-class system utilizing a waters acquity beh- <dig> uplc column packed with a c4stationary phase  in conjunction with hrms analysis by a waters xero-g <dig> quadropole-tof electrospray mass spectrometer. proteins  in  <dig>  mm tris-hcl buffer at ph  <dig> were incubated in the presence or absence of  <dig> μm carbapenem for  <dig> h at room temperature. reactions were quenched by the addition of trifluoracetic acid . samples were filtered through a  <dig>  μm filter and analyzed by uplc/ms at  <dig> °c. mobile phase: 0– <dig> min 90% water + 10% acetonitrile  +  <dig> % tfa, 1– <dig>  min gradient up to 20% water + 80% acn +  <dig> % tfa,  <dig> – <dig>  min 20% water + 80% acn +  <dig> % tfa,  <dig> – <dig>  min gradient up to 90% water + 10% acn +  <dig> % tfa,  <dig> – <dig> min 90% water + 10% acn +  <dig> % tfa. flow rate =  <dig>  ml min- <dig> t =  <dig> °c. the theoretical average mass including amino acids from the tev cleavage site and linker of  <dig> da was calculated using the expasy mass calculator server .

carbapenem docking studies
the docking of biapenem and tebipenem molecules to the ldtmt <dig> outer cavity was simulated using the program moe. models of the carbapenems were built with the molecular builder feature of moe using a small-molecule  force field as is implemented in the program. these initial models were used as starting point of a quantum mechanical optimization using the program gamess  <cit>  with a 6311+ gaussian basis and a b3lyp density functional. flexible docking of the carbapenems were performed utilizing the rigid body docking routine of moe. an induced fit option using a weak harmonic tether  between the sulfur atom of cys <dig> and c <dig> of the carbapenem as restrain was used to steer the docking. an amber12ht force field included in the software was used for the binding pocket minimization.

RESULTS
biapenem- and tebipenem-ldtmt <dig> adducts
in this study, we produced crystals of ldtmt2
apo and enzyme reacted with biapenem or tebipenem, and collected x-ray diffraction data at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å resolutions, respectively. all crystal forms belong to the monoclinic p <dig> space group with similar cell dimensions and contain two molecules per asymmetric unit . electronic density for the amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> of chain a and to the c-terminus  of chain b was observed in all three structures. the structures were refined to a better than  <dig>  rwork and  <dig>  rfree with similar refinement protocols. all the structures have more than 96% of the residues in favored regions of their respective ramachandran plots . our apo-ldtmt <dig> structure and the previously solved apo-ldtmt <dig> structure  have  <dig>  Å of rmsd among  <dig> cα atoms aligned. the apo and holo structures show negligible differences among them . the rmsds are  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å between apo-ldtmt <dig> and ldtmt2-biapenem or ldtmt2-tebipenem, respectively, and  <dig>  Å between the holo structures for the same  <dig> aligned cα atoms aligned.fig.  <dig> apo-ldtmt <dig> and adduct structures. a overlap of the apo- , biapenem- , and tebipenem-complexes  of ldtmt <dig>  blga  and blgb  are bacterial immunoglobulin-like  domains and cd  is the catalytic domain. b & c simulating annealing omit map at the active site of ldtmt2-biapenem  and ldtmt2-tebipenem . the refined structure of the respective catalytic site and adduct are shown. the adduct atoms were omitted during a mock refinement cycle including a torsional simulated annealing step using the refinement program phenix. the omit maps were contoured at  <dig>  σ level. in both panels the mtoa-adducts are colored green . d chemical structure of the common β-lactam core of the anticipated non-degraded adducts. e chemical structure of the observed adduct in both complexes




acyl adduct in ldtmt2-biapenem and ldtmt2-tebipenem complexes are identical
additional electron density connected to the catalytic cys <dig> thiol group and extending to the outer cavity was observed in ldtmt2–biapenem and ldtmt2–tebipenem complexes. interestingly, the electron densities in these complexes are similar in size and shape . the observed densities are larger than the glycerol molecule observed in the apo-ldtmt <dig> crystal form  but smaller than expected for an intact biapenem or tebipenem adduct as illustrated in fig. 1d. in both adduct crystals , a small-disconnected electron density was observed at the inner cavity near the catalytic cysteine. this density is inconsistent with any of the mother-liquor components and was therefore interpreted as a remnant of the hydroxyethyl substituent at c <dig> that is dissociated from the carbapenems . based on the shape and coordination of the substituent groups and considering feasible chemical reactions  at the carbapenem core , a -4-methyl- <dig> ,7-trioxoheptanoic acid  acyl adduct  was modeled bound to thiol group of the catalytic cysteine in both crystal forms. the glycerol molecule found in the apo-ldtmt <dig> crystal form is disconnected at  <dig>  Å from the catalytic cysteine and poorly overlapping with the larger and connected mtoa adduct . the possibility of the enzyme reacting with a common contaminant product of the carbapenems degradation was also disregarded following ap-maldi analysis of the reagents used .

biapenem and tebipenem react exothermically with ldtmt2
the heat of reaction associated with acylation of ldtmt <dig> by biapenem and tebipenem was measured using a vp-itc calorimeter . following injection, a fast exothermic reaction peak is observed when ldtmt <dig> is titrated with biapenem or tebipenem. in the case of biapenem, the sharp initial heat exchange peak was followed by a very slow return to the baseline indicating that a secondary reaction  follows the initial rapid binding/acylation . although the adduct formation does not involves a binding equilibrium, the apparent thermodynamic parameters of binding are shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> heat exchange during biapenem and tebipenem adduct formation with ldtmt <dig>  both carbapenem show exothermic heat exchanges after the addition of the carbapenem to the reaction cell containing enzyme




mass spectrometry confirms the acylation of ldtmt <dig> by the carbapenems
following a five hour incubation of ldtmt <dig> with molar excess of the carbapenems  the mass spectra of the reacted species were analyzed . despite only the mtoa adduct  being observed in the crystal structure, the tebipenem-ldtmt <dig> sample shows peaks with a Δm/z of  <dig>  da, corresponding to the expected mass of an intact tebipenem adduct to ldtmt <dig> , with a Δm/z of  <dig>  da, and a minor peak with a Δm/z of  <dig> da . this discrepancy is likely attributable to the long incubation times required during co-crystallization. the second peak has a  <dig> da decrease with respect to the largest one. the smallest peak of Δm/z =  <dig> da may be the result of the irreversible oxidation of the thiol to sulphinic acid, resulting in a likely inactive form of the enzyme. surprisingly, when biapenem was incubated with ldtmt <dig>  a unique peak of Δm/z of  <dig>  da was observed .table  <dig> uplc-hrms of inhibited ldmt <dig> species

the initial adducts degrade after acylation
we used maldi-tof mass spectrometry  to qualitatively investigate temporal changes in the mass of the adduct species in the secondary reaction observed by calorimetry toward identifying the degradation intermediates. after a short incubation, the difference between primary peaks of the mass spectra of unreacted ldtmt <dig> and the biapenem-ldtmt <dig> complex was Δm/z =  <dig> da, which is less than the expected increase for an intact biapenem adduct . after  <dig> min and up to  <dig> h, the primary signal differences stabilized at  <dig> da . in the tebipenem case, the primary peak differences after  <dig> min and  <dig> h of incubation showed Δm/z of  <dig> da.table  <dig> difference between primary peaks of the maldi/tof spectra of apo-ldtmt <dig> and ldtmt <dig> inactivated by biapenem and tebipenem at different reaction times

the catalytic domains  of apo-ldtmt <dig> ) and apo-ldtmt <dig>  overlap with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å for  <dig> cα-atoms aligned; only the β-hairpin flap  is displaced in ldtmt <dig>  with displacements ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  Å toward the outer cavity  that results in a  <dig>  Å shift of tyr <dig> from tyr <dig> of ldtmt <dig> . most of the residues lining the outer cavity are conserved between ldtmt <dig> and ldtmt <dig>  however adduct-enzyme interactions of ldtmt2-biapenem and ldtmt2-tebipenem do not parallel those in ldtmt1-imipenem . the ldtmt1-imipenem  structure shows a partial imipenem molecule  covalently bound to the catalytic cysteine  and extending to the outer cavity of ldtmt <dig>  <cit> . structures of apo- and holo-ldtmt <dig> are not significantly different following adduct formation . the shift of tyr <dig> in ldtmt <dig> increases the clearance for the hydroxyethyl side chain of imipenem . conversely, in the ldtmt2-meropenem  and ldtmt5-meropenem structures  the meropenem adduct is bound at the inner cavity. in the ldtmt2-meropenem structure, meropenem binding shifts the β-hairpin flap between  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å away from the core of the cd . the meropenem adduct interacts minimally with motif residues and residues in the inner cavity pocket .fig.  <dig> structural comparison of mtb ldts with different carbapenem adducts. a overlay of catalytic domains of apo-ldtmt <dig>  and apo-ldtmt <dig> . red arrows show the displacement of the β-hairpin flap between paralogs. b two views related by a counterclockwise 90° rotation of the overlay of outer cavity-bound adducts of ldtmt1-imipenem  and ldtmt2-mtoa corresponding to the biapenem/ldtmt <dig> complex structure . c overlay of the ldtmt <dig> catalytic domains of ldtmt2-meropenem  and ldtmt2-mtoa adduct . red arrows show the displacement of the β-hairpin flap between these complexes forming inner- and outer-cavity adducts, respectively. d overlay of the catalytic site of ldtmt2-meropenem  and ldtmt2-mtoa . red arrows in the panels  and  show the displacement of the conserved tyr <dig> on the β-hairpin flap that in ldtmt1-imipenem and ldtmt2-meropenem interacts with the carbapenems hydroxyacetyl substituent, such interaction is loss in mtoa by the elimination of this group after adduct formation




the intact carbapenems dock at the outer cavity engaging ldt motif residues
docking simulations of biapenem and tebipenem at the catalytic site of ldtmt <dig> favors extensive interactions of cyclic portions of the carbapenems with residues of the outer cavity . when docked to the outer cavity, the portions of intact biapenem and tebipenem that mimic the d-ala <dig> moiety of the acyl-donor/acceptor are strongly recognized by conserved outer cavity residues. the best scored docking positions of these carbapenems place the protonated nε of the catalytic his <dig>  buried and in close contact  with the c <dig> and n <dig> groups of these carbapenems. the carbapenem carboxylate accepts hydrogen bonds from his <dig>  asn <dig>  and trp <dig>  the main-chain nh groups of his <dig>  gly <dig> and cys <dig>  surround the carbonyl oxygen  of the β-lactam ring. the hydrophobic side of the carbapenem core contacts aromatic ring of tyr <dig> and thr <dig>  the hydroxyethyl substituent at c <dig> contacts met <dig>  thr <dig>  and his <dig>  and hydrogen-bond to tyr <dig>  the hydrophilic residues thr <dig>  his <dig>  and tyr <dig> remain connected to bulk solvent and may shuttle protons from it. these contacts, in particular the ones with tyr <dig> and thr <dig>  both in the β-hairpin loop, result in outer cavity opening. the orientations of both docked carbapenems expose their s-conjugate group to the solvent, with biapenem  exposed to a lesser extent than tebipenem .fig.  <dig> predicted binding models of the biapenem and tebipenem interactions with ldtmt <dig>  docking results of the binding of intact  biapenem and  tebipenem to the outer cavity of ldtmt <dig>  left panels of  and  show the solvent accessible surface corresponding to the outer cavity and tunnel connecting to the inner cavity. the carbapenems  and ldtmt <dig> residues that participate in binding . the protein-ligand interactions are shown in the right panels. residues circled are in van der waals contact with the ligand; those colored green and pink are hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues, respectively. hydrogen bonds are marked as black dashed arrows starting in the proton donor. the red dashed arrow highlights the cys354-c <dig> tether used for the steered docking simulation. purple clouds around carbapenem atoms indicate solvent exposure, and the size of the clouds indicates the degree of exposure. offset blue circles indicate partial exposure of the protein residue. the drawing and analysis were performed using moe




discussion
carbapenems inactivate transpeptidases by covalently binding to the enzyme’s catalytic serine or cysteine residue. hydrolysis of this acyl-enzyme bond or transfer of the adducting acyl group to an acyl-acceptor reactivates the enzyme. transpeptidases have evolved to transfer the acyl-adduct form in the first step of the transpeptidation to abundantly present in vivo acyl-acceptors, a process that is much faster than water-mediated hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme ester bond. hydrolysis of the thioester bond between these carbapenem and the catalytic cysteine is a very slow process in vitro . increased stability of the acyl-bond in a carbapenem adduct concerning acyl-transference is not expected, as this bond is not substantially different to that in the peptidyl-pg adduct. whenever the acyl transfer step is not inhibited by the adduct, a rapid reactivation of the enzyme could be expected. thus, carbapenems that form an adduct interfering with the acyl-transfer step may be better inactivators resulting in enhanced antimicrobial properties.

the stability of the enzyme-adduct bond to acyl-transfer has seldom been studied. only very recently, steiner et al  <cit>  have shown that reactivation of ldtmt2-faropenem does not occur when mdap is used as the acyl-acceptor, suggesting that the small β-oh-butyryl adduct remnant is enough to inhibit transpeptidation . however, reactivation by acyl-transfer still cannot be discarded; the same study observed an acyl-transfer-generated 6-aminopenicillanic acid dimer while studying ldtmt <dig> inactivation  <cit> . the single peptidyl stem residue mdap binds to ldtmt <dig> weakly, as is suggested by the high concentration  used to observe adducts, and larger pg fragments may overcome the adduct acyl-transfer inhibition.

the structures of carbapenems adducts of ldtmt <dig>  ldtmt <dig>  and ldtmt <dig> have shown that these carbapenems, despite being structurally similar, display two distinct modes of binding . outer and inner cavity bound carbapenems create different access routes to the acyl-bond of the adduct by acyl-acceptors , a factor that could affect negatively enzyme inactivation. carbapenem adducts bound to the inner cavity of ldts openly present the acyl-enzyme bond to an acyl-acceptor bound to the empty outer cavity . instead, outer cavity adducts may inhibit acyl-acceptor recognition by ldt motif residues that line the outer cavity . even though previously proposed crosslinking mechanisms  <cit>  are in disagreement with the recognition of the acyl-donor substrate by ldtmt <dig>  both agree the acyl-acceptor accesses the catalytic site from the outer cavity. acyl-acceptors attacking the acyl-enzyme bond from the open inner cavity have poor specific recognition, potentially decreasing the chance of being optimally positioned for acyl-adduct transfer . inner cavity adducts may have a reduced ability to prevent the reactivation of the enzyme by inhibiting acyl transfer to an acyl-acceptor coming from the outer cavity. inner cavity adducts could disturb the outer cavity thereby impairing the recognition of acyl-acceptors , but there is a minimal effect on ldt motif residues associated with acyl-acceptor recognition . consequently, the inactivation of ldts by outer-cavity forming adducts, like biapenem and tebipenem may be more effective as inhibitors in vivo.fig.  <dig> the different accessibilities of the thioester-bond in the two observed binding modes. a view from the outer cavity of the meropenem-adduct of ldtmt <dig>  <cit> . b view from the inner cavity of the mtoa-adduct of ldtmt2





apparently, the carbapenems/ldtmt <dig> reactions display exothermic or endothermic enthalpic character depending on whether the adduct is bound to the ldtmt <dig> outer or inner cavity, respectively. exothermic heat exchanges have been observed for the reaction with outer-cavity adduct forming carbapenems  <cit> . in contrast, when ldtmt <dig> is titrated with the inner cavity adduct forming meropenem  an endothermic heat exchange has been observed  <cit> . with an expected similar free energy of acylation for both types of adducts, outer cavity bound adducts engage more polar residues—each providing a negative enthalpic contribution—than inner cavity bound adducts, which could explain the different enthalpic characteristics of the two binding modes.

the carbapenem adducts in both crystal forms studied here underwent loss of the c <dig> and c <dig> substituents. comparing the observed adduct  to docking simulations of the intact carbapenems , it is evident that the adduct degradation a) increases accessibility to the catalytic site of acyl-acceptors, and b) diminishes the inhibition of the acyl-acceptor recognition by increasing accessibility to the ldt-motif residues that are responsible of acyl-acceptor recognition. overall these modifications may affect the antibiotic potency by enabling the reactivation of the enzyme by the acyl-adduct transference to the abundant in-vivo acyl-acceptors. thus, understanding the degradation mechanism is essential in rationally devising carbapenems resistant to degradation by the enzyme.

we are proposing the mechanism of inactivation of ldtmt <dig> by biapenem and tebipenem and a possible path of degradation of these carbapenems on the basis of our crystallographic and mass spectrometry data . as in the enzymatic mechanism proposed for serine and cysteine proteases, ldtmt <dig> residue his <dig> is poised to deprotonate cys <dig>  converting it to a nucleophilic thiolate that attacks the carbonyl carbon at position  <dig>  of the carbapenem . residues in the loop containing the catalytic cysteine  form the oxyanion hole by having their main chain nh groups oriented so as to concentrate their residual positive charge toward a pocket. in this pocket, the oxygen of the carbonyl group at c <dig> forms hydrogen bonds to his <dig> and cys <dig> main chain atoms . the acylation is aided by the oxyanion-hole stabilization of the negative charge formed at the oxygen in the tetrahedral intermediate . the acylation causes β-lactam ring opening and the formation of an imine, while the pyrroline ring tautomerizes to a more stable Δ <dig> tautomer by acquiring a proton at c <dig> . up to here, the reaction produces the acyl-enzyme product expected when a β-lactam compound reacts with a thiolate. however, the observed electron density suggests the loss of the group at c <dig> and opening of pyrroline ring. thus, we are proposing the following degradation mechanism. following acylation, the n <dig> group of the open carbapenem is in close proximity to the charged his <dig> and over the oxyanion hole, positioning it to withdraw the proton from his <dig> previously abstracted from cys <dig> . the net positive charge of the resulting iminium and oxyanion hole increases the proton acidity at c <dig> facilitating its abstraction by a base required to trigger the following steps. after the proton abstraction, the resulting compound undergoes thiol-conjugate elimination , followed by the opening of the ring by a nucleophilic attack by water . a proton-transfer tautomerizes the enol form of the pyruvate group to a more stable keto form . the mass of the resulting compound  is in good agreement with the difference between primary signals observed by maldi-tof of the ldtmt <dig> biapenem reaction after a short incubation . the mechanism described in steps 4– <dig> is similar to the last step of the thiol-conjugated group elimination by β-lyases  <cit> . these enzymes catalyze the reaction rschchnh3
+ + h2o → rsh + nh4
+ + pyruvate  <cit> .fig.  <dig> proposed mechanisms of biapenem and tebipenem adduct formation and degradation. the figure shows the chemical steps  to reach the crystallographically observed adducts from the expected initial  carbapenem adduct of the enzyme. the expected mass differences in each step of the reaction are annotated for comparison with the observed species in the mass spectrometry experiments. a final decarboxylation step , where the product is observed in the esi mass spectra but not in the crystal, is included as a possible explanation. the mass increases caused by the adducts were calculated using the program chemdraw®




although both complex crystals showed the same adduct lacking the thiol-conjugate substituent, the mass change observed in tebipenem samples following a  <dig> h incubation are larger than expected . the elimination 1-azetidine-3-thiol substituent of the tebipenem adduct is observed in the crystal  suggesting that this elimination is a much slower process than the rapid elimination of the -thio group of the biapenem adduct . the substituent at c <dig> is likely eliminated from the core of the different carbapenems at different rates. in β-lyases  <cit>  electron-withdrawing groups conjugated to the thiol, such as the bicyclotriazolium group in biapenem, undergo more rapid elimination. the elimination of the thiolsulfide group at c <dig> results in a positively charged iminium substituent at c <dig> . the docking of this substituent at the oxyanion hole and its close coordination by a high number of hydrogen-bond donors  observed in the crystal structure  suggests the non proton-acceptor iminium group is hydrolyzed to a ketone .

the electron density of the hydroxyethyl substituent at c <dig> was absent in both crystal forms, suggesting the elimination of this group as acetaldehyde by a retro-aldol reaction . the  <dig> da decrease in the mass in both adducts detected by mass spectrometry experiments  are compatible with the proposed elimination . decarboxylation  is also a possibility although it is not supported by our crystallographic results. the elimination of this group via a retro-aldol reaction has also been proposed to occur in class a and c β-lactamases adducts  <cit> . the hydroxyethyl substituent elimination occurred at substantially different rates for each carbapenem. in the tebipenem sample, this occurred before elimination of the c <dig> substituent was detectable, while in biapenem it occurred immediately and apparently before c <dig> substituent elimination . after a  <dig> min incubation of biapenem and ldtmt <dig>  the difference between mass spectra primary signals stabilized at around a  <dig> da, which is  <dig> da less than difference observed after a short incubation  and closely matches the difference expected .

not all carbapenems with a thiol conjugate group at c <dig> are expected to degrade via the pathway outlined in fig.  <dig>  factors such as the electron withdrawing properties of the thiol substituent and/or binding site interactions with substituent groups could control the degradation. for example, in the ldtmt1-imipenem adduct the hydroxyethyl substituent is not eliminated, perhaps because this group is better accommodated in the ldtmt <dig> binding site due to the displaced position of the β-hairpin loop . the loss of the hydroxyethyl substituent of biapenem and tebipenem allows the ldtmt2-adduct to adopt a closed conformation of the β-hairpin loop . conversely, the open conformation is observed in the meropenem adduct  <cit>  in which that group interacts with tyr <dig> at the β-hairpin loop . mutations of tyr <dig> to either phenylalanine or alanine have been shown to enhance meropenem hydrolysis  <cit> . these mutations remove contacts between adduct and β-hairpin loop that may restore active conformations of the enzyme.

decarboxylation of the mtoa adduct results in a Δm/z of  <dig>  da, that closely matches the  <dig>  da observed for ldtmt2-biapenem by mass spectrometry . the decarboxylation may result from the sampling conditions . few biapenem degradation paths exist yielding this observed adduct mass. thus, this finding provides strong additional evidence supporting the identification of mtoa as the adduct observed in the ldtmt2-biapenem crystal.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, biapenem and tebipenem bind to the outer cavity of ldtmt <dig> and inactivate the enzyme, ultimately forming the same adduct following degradation. these new ldt-carbapenem structures provide additional evidence that binding to the outer cavity is the predominant mode by which carbapenems bind to mtb ldts. although the reaction enthalpy data are limited to a small number of inner-cavity bound carbapenems, the apparent correlation between binding mode and thermodynamic trend suggests a simple method to determine the binding mode: exothermic reaction profiles are indicative of binding to the outer cavity, while endothermic reaction profiles may indicate binding to the inner cavity.

carbapenems that form outer-cavity adducts have the potential to be better inhibitors than inner-cavity adducts, as they may engage ldt motif residues that sequentially recognize acyl-donor and acyl-acceptor pg stem peptide substrates. this and other recent studies  <cit>  show that outer-cavity adducts are subject to ldtmt <dig> catalyzed degradation that may reduce their interference with in vivo acyl-transfer, highlighting the need to consider binding mode and resistance to enzymatic degradation in antibiotic design. kinetic studies examining the difference between enzymatic rates of acylation and deacylation by hydrolysis or acyl group transference to in vivo substrates are warranted, as the resulting rate of inactivation will assist in the rational design of antibiotics.

importantly, the observed elimination of thiol-conjugate group at c <dig> could be devised as a means of targeted and localized release of a synergistic antimicrobial factor carried by a carbapenem in the form of an s-conjugated substituent. as attempted in cephalosporin-based biofilm dispersing no-donor pro-drugs activated by β-lactamases  <cit> , the design of ldt activated pro-drugs based on the carbapenem scaffold might also be worth pursuing.
