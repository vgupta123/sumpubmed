BACKGROUND
circadian rhythms are endogenous self-sustained oscillations with approximately 24-hr rhythmicity that are manifested in various physiological and metabolic processes  <cit>  in mammals the circadian orchestration of these processes is governed by pacemaker cells located within the suprachiasmatic nuclei  of the hypothalamus. it has also revealed that in mammals circadian oscillators exist not only in the scn but also in peripheral tissues, and even in immortalized cells  <cit> . because the periodicity of the circadian clock only approximates that of the environment, circadian clocks have to be adjusted to 24-h/day period by environmental time cues  <cit> . circadian clocks are primarily synchronized with environmental time by the daylight cycle as an input signal to the scn through the direct and indirect neural projections from retinal ganglion cells  <cit> , however, other non-photic cues can also synchronize circadian clocks to 24-h/day  <cit> .

the molecular mechanism of the circadian oscillator as a transcriptional-translational feedback loop has been unraveled by genetic analysis in drosophila and mammals  <cit> . these molecular mechanisms based on the transcriptional-translational regulation are conserved among many species, including arabidopsis, neurospora, drosophila, zebrafish, and mammals  <cit> . in mammals, principally two basic helix-loop-helix-pas transcriptional factors, clock and bmal <dig>  regulate gene expression by interacting with a promoter element termed e-box  <cit> . target genes of these transcriptional factors include several repressor proteins, including per <dig>  per <dig>  per <dig>  cry <dig>  and cry <dig>  which function to inhibit the activity of clock/bmal <dig> complex by entering into the nucleus  <cit> , thereby generating a circadian oscillation of their own transcription.

one of the molecular features of circadian clocks is rhythmic fluctuation of clock gene mrna amounts. in situ hybridization and rnase protection assay are conventional techniques used to detect expression profiles of the clock and clock-controlled genes . quantitative real-time rt-pcr has recently become a popular method to investigate mrna expression profiles . the bioluminescent firefly luciferase protein has proven to be a useful reporter protein for monitoring the dynamics of gene activity in living cells  <cit> . luminescence from luciferase expressed in transgenic plants, drosophila, zebrafish and mammals has been used to monitor real-time dynamic change in gene transcription within the living organism  <cit> . since this system is applied to transiently transfected cell cultures with clock gene promoters driving firefly luciferase gene expression  <cit> , luciferase real-time monitoring system using photomultiplier tubes has become a powerful tool to investigate circadian clock mechanism, in particular to identify the critical elements for producing the circadian rhythmicity  <cit> .

as described above, it has been thought that circadian clocks in peripheral tissues are regulated by the scn via the secretion of hormones and/or the sympathetic/parasympathetic innervations from the scn to peripheral tissues  <cit> . recently, some potential "entrainment factors" have been reported  <cit> , however, the mechanisms how the central scn pacemaker clock orchestrates the peripheral clocks remains unclear. here, we report systematic screening of various molecules in attempt to find entrainment factors by using our in vitro real-time oscillation monitoring system . in this study, we report eight novel candidates, including 15-deoxy-Δ <dig> -prostaglandin j <dig> , of entrainment factors for circadian clocks.

RESULTS
establishment of iv-roms using mper2-luc/rat <dig> cell lines
the photomultiplier tube detector system can detect bioluminescence of luciferase protein and can measure it every  <dig> min using a turntable . this system is maintained in an incubator at 5% co <dig> and 35°c. we first established mper2-luc/rat <dig> fibroblast cell lines that stably express luciferase gene driven by mper <dig> promoter. per <dig> is considered to be one of the core molecule for molecular clocks since gene-knockout analysis revealed that mper <dig> mutants display a shorted circadian period followed by a loss of circadian rhythmicity in constant darkness  <cit> . after stimulation with high concentration of serum for  <dig> h, rhythmicity of luciferase activity was monitored for duration of at least  <dig> or  <dig> days . in contrast to no oscillation in control , rhythmic activity of luciferase was observed. rhythmic phase of mper2-luc/rat <dig> cell lines was phenotypically the same as that in transiently transfected cells with mper2-luc construct and was antiphase compared to transient transfected cells with hbmal1-luc construct  <cit> . these cell lines showed no abnormalities in their cell growth and morphology. in summary, these cell lines established here are suitable for the screening assay designed to identify entrainment factors for circadian clocks.

screening of peptide and bioactive lipid libraries for circadian entrainment factors
the results of screening are shown in figure 1b and additional file  <dig> by using peptide library  and bioactive lipid library . out of  <dig> compounds screened,  <dig> demonstrated the rhythmic expression of luciferase. among them, four compounds  have already been reported as resetting factors in vivo or in vitro  <cit> . by this assay, we newly identified eight candidates for circadian entrainment factors; prostaglandin j <dig> , Δ12-pgj <dig>  15-deoxy-Δ <dig> -pgj <dig> , enantio-paf c <dig>  1-acyl-paf, 6-formylindolo  carbazole, palmitoyl dopamine, and arachidonoyl dopamine. these two libraries contain five known entrainment factors and we could identify all of them, except prostaglandin e <dig>  <cit> , as an entrainment factor by this assay system , indicating that this assay system is reliable and suitable for screening of entrainment factors. we could not identify prostaglandin e <dig> because prostaglandin e <dig> receptor ep <dig>  which is responsible for the entrainment of circadian clocks, was not expressed in rat <dig> cells, but was expressed in nih3t <dig> cells that tsuchiya et al used  <cit>  .

15d-pgj <dig> triggers the rhythmic expression of endogenous clock genes in nih3t <dig> cells
among the eight novel candidates for entrainment factors, we focused on 15d-pgj <dig>  because cells stimulated by 15d-pgj <dig> displayed the most robust effects on rhythmicity. 15d-pgj <dig> has recently received increasing attention because it functions as a potential regulator of diverse processes including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation  <cit> . in addition, 15d-pgj <dig> is the dehydration end product of pgd <dig>  interestingly, pgd <dig> has been recognized as the most potent endogenous sleep-promoting substance  <cit> . furthermore, the pgd <dig> concentration in rat cerebrospinal fluid shows a circadian shift coupled to the sleep-wake cycle  <cit> . to confirm whether 15d-pgj <dig> is an authentic endogenous entrainment factor, we examined the expression profiles of clock genes in nih3t <dig> fibroblast cells stimulated by 15d-pgj <dig>  per <dig> and bmal <dig> expression patterns were examined by quantitative real-time rt-pcr at 4-h intervals for duration of  <dig> h and rhythmic expressions were observed when treated for  <dig> h with 15d-pgj <dig> and with high concentration serum, but not when treated with dmso as a control . moreover, phases of per <dig> and bmal <dig> mrna expression triggered by 15d-pgj <dig> treatment were antiphasic with respect to each other, which is consistent with those triggered by serum and with previously reported expression profiles  <cit> . taken together, these results demonstrate that 15d-pgj <dig> can act as an in vitro entrainment factor for circadian clocks. pgd <dig> and other prostaglandins and prostanoids examined in this study showed no rhythmic fluctuation of luciferase activity . the facts that 15d-pgj2's precursor pgd <dig> has been recognized as the most potent endogenous sleep-promoting substance and that the pgd <dig> concentration in rat cerebrospinal fluid shows a circadian change coupled to the sleep-wake cycle, have led to the hypothesis that 15d-pgj <dig> may act as an endogenous circadian entrainment factor in vivo. it would be interesting to see the effects of 15d-pgj <dig> in vivo. however, it should be noted that the endogenous concentration of 15d-pgj <dig> is extremely low  <cit> , compared with the one used for the in vitro screening.

15d-pgj <dig> up-regulates cry <dig>  cry <dig>  and rorα mrna expressions
to examine which clock genes are induced by 15d-pgj <dig> treatment, we systematically quantified the expression levels of the canonical clock genes. after the isolation of total rna at 1-h intervals from nih3t <dig> cells stimulated by 15d-pgj <dig>  quantitative real-time rt-pcr was performed using primers for per <dig>  per <dig>  per <dig>  bmal <dig>  npas <dig>  cry <dig>  cry <dig>  dec <dig>  dec <dig>  e4bp <dig>  dbp, and rorα by using low-density arrays. unexpectedly, stimulation with 15d-pgj <dig> did not affect a transient per <dig> and per <dig> mrna accumulation , although both per genes are known to be transiently accumulated by the various stimuli of entrainment  <cit> . on the other hand, we for the first time found that 15d-pgj <dig> induced accumulation of cry <dig> and cry <dig> transcripts, as well as rorα mrna , which is consistent with a previous report  <cit> .

entrainment triggered by 15d-pgj <dig> is independent of ppar-γ signaling pathway
we next sought to identify entrainment signaling pathways triggered by 15d-pgj <dig>  since 15d-pgj <dig> has been known to be a natural ligand of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ   <cit> , we assessed whether the clock gene expression triggered by 15d-pgj <dig> is dependent on the ppar-γ-mediated signaling pathway. nih3t <dig> cells pretreated with dmso or with a specific irreversible ppar-γ antagonist gw <dig>  <cit>  were then stimulated with 15d-pgj <dig>  and harvested at every  <dig> h for duration of  <dig> h. quantitative real-time rt-pcr using primers for per <dig> and bmal <dig> showed no different expression patterns between gw <dig> and dmso pretreated cells . the same concentration  of 15d-pgj <dig> induced gadd <dig> and catalase mrna, which are induced via ppar-γ, in the same nih3t <dig> cells, however, no stimulation of both mrnas was seen in these cells pretreated with  <dig> μm gw <dig> , indicating that these cells express ppar-γ, that ppar-γ was involved in our observation, and that the amount of gw <dig> we used was enough for the system to work. these results suggest that the circadian entrainment triggered by 15d-pgj <dig> is independent of the ppar-γ signaling pathway. we further confirmed that other ppar-γ ligands, ciglitazone  <cit>  and hexadecyl azelaoyl phosphatidlycholine   <cit> , did not lead to the circadian expression of the clock genes .

we then explored which signaling pathways are involved in 15d-pgj2-induced rhythmic clock gene expression. recently, administration of 15d-pgj <dig> was shown to activate erk and jnk signaling pathways  <cit> . the known entrainment factors are thought to mainly act by activating erk signaling pathway  <cit> . we thus examined whether these two mapk signaling pathways can be linked with 15d-pgj2-induced cyclic gene expression. surprisingly, pretreatment of a specific jnk inhibitor sp <dig>  <cit>  and of a specific mek inhibitor u <dig>  <cit> , both showed no effect on the entrainment of circadian clocks . although results of mapk/erk to entrainment in the different systems have been inconsistent  <cit> , these results suggest that there exists an unknown entrainment pathway, independent of the erk-mediated signaling pathway. meanwhile, another pathway, the p <dig> mapk signaling pathway was recently shown to be associated with circadian clocks by modulating their period lengths  <cit> . sb <dig>  a specific p <dig> inhibitor  <cit> , slightly delayed the phase of per <dig> rhythms but did not affect circadian expression of both per <dig> and bmal <dig> , indicating that p <dig> mapk signaling pathway is involved in modulation of period length, but not in the induction of clock gene expression by 15d-pgj <dig> 

the interpretation of this study on the transcription-translation feedback loops of clock genes are summarized in figure 5a. as shown in figure  <dig>  15d-pgj <dig> up-regulates transcription of crys and rorα . the translated rorα activates bmal <dig> transcription  <cit> , and translated bmal <dig> binds to clock forming a heterodimer which activates per/cry and rev-erb transcriptions via e/e' elements . translated per/cry and rev-erb inhibit transcription of per/cry/rev-erb and bmal <dig> genes, respectively . the inhibition of rev-erb transcription also reduces bmal <dig> transcription . the reduced per/cry transcription and relatively increased rorα activity  again up-regulate bmal <dig> transcription and result in a completion of the "loop" .

in vitro real-time oscillation monitoring system 
iv-roms can be applied to identify molecules which are involved in other mechanisms pertaining to circadian clock system; transcriptional-translational feedback loops of circadian mechanism and input signaling pathway mechanism, for example, by using rnai, inhibitor, and other libraries. we can also apply this system to other research fields. further modification and development of this system will be needed in order to be applied for more systematic and high-throughput screenings.

CONCLUSIONS
here we present the in vitro real-time oscillation monitoring system . indeed, we newly found eight candidates out of  <dig> compounds as circadian entrainment factors . we further confirmed that one of the candidates, 15d-pgj <dig>  triggers the rhythmic expression of endogenous circadian clocks by inducing crys and rorα, but not pers, in nih3t <dig> cells , indicating that this assay system is a powerful and useful tool for the initial screening procedure. this system can also be applied not only to find new intracellular molecules involved in circadian clocks; new transcription factors, new signaling and degradation pathways, but also to investigate other cellular mechanisms like cell-cycle or oncogenesis.
