BACKGROUND
panax notoginseng  f.h. chen is highly valued medicinal plant of the araliaceae family  <cit> . p. notoginseng is distributed in the southwestern region of china, burma and nepal  <cit> . presently, this species can only be found in cultivated forms  <cit> . in china, p. notoginseng is cultiviated commercially in wenshan county, yunnan province  <cit> . the roots of this plant, called notoginseng or sanchi, are commonly used as a hemostatic agent as well as a tonic to promote quality of life. in addition, the herb of sanqi possesses the bioactivities of antihypertensive, antithrombotic, anti-atherosclerotic and neuroprotective actions  <cit> . the ingredients detected in p. notoginseng include triterpene saponins, non-protein amino acids, polyacetylenes, phytosterols, flavonoids, and polysaccharides, many of which have pharmacological activities and are useful in the treatment of some diseases  <cit> . among these compounds, triterpene saponins, a group of ginsenosides, are considered to be the principal bioactive components responsible for the pharmacological features  <cit> . approximately  <dig> triterpene saponins have been isolated from p. notoginseng including ginsenosides, notoginsenosides, and gypenosides  <cit> . the major ginsenosides are the dammarane glycosides, and the ginsenoside rg <dig>  rb <dig>  rd, and notoginsenoside r <dig> are considered as the major constituents found in the p. notoginseng root  <cit> . all the dammarane saponins have been classified as two groups: the protopanaxadiols group and the protopanaxatriols group  <cit> . the oleanane-type saponin, ro, which exists in asian ginseng  and american ginseng , have not been found in p. notoginseng based on the evidence from phytochemical studies  <cit> .

triterpene saponins are synthesized via the mevalonic acid  pathway  <cit> , which is ubiquitous in plants and provides the precursor  <dig> -oxidosqualene for terpenoid biosynthesis. the cyclization of  <dig> -oxidosqalene by oxidosqualene cyclase  combined with the following modifications on the triterpene skeletons including hydroxylation and glycosidation leads to the production of various ginsenosides . the osc genes including dammarenediol synthase , β-amyrin , lupeol synthase  and cycloartenol synthase  have been isolated in plants  <cit> . the characterization of ds, the first key enzyme committed in the biosynthesis of dammarane-type saponins, was profoundly advanced the studies on triterpene saponin biosynthesis in p. ginseng  <cit> . however, little is known about the molecular mechanism of the biosynthetic pathway downstream of cyclization involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis . some specific cytochrome p450-dependent monoxygenases  and udp-glycosyltransferases , which might be existed in panax plants, are proposed to catalyze the conversion of dammarenediol-ii or β-amyrin to various ginsenosides and the modification on ginsenosides. in our previous study, one candidate cyp <dig> and four candidate ugts most likely to be involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis have been selected from p. quinquefolius  <cit> . these candidate genes were screened from the 454-est dataset of p. quinquefolius root based on the analysis of tissue-specific expression pattern and methyl jasmonate  induction  <cit> .

despite its pharmacological importance, the transcriptomic and genomic data of p. notoginseng are very limited and only  <dig> ests are available in the national center for biotechnology information  database. the limited transcriptomic data hinder the study of triterpene saponin biosynthetic mechanisms in p. notoginseng. expressed sequence tag  analysis is a useful tool for the purposes of gene discovery especially in non-model plants for which no reference genome sequences are available  <cit> . ests represent the expressed portion of a genome  <cit>  and can be used to characterize patterns of gene expression in special tissues  <cit> . the discovery and prediction of genes involved in triterpene saponin and other secondary metabolite biosynthesis was performed based on est analysis  <cit> . the triterpene carboxylic acid glucosyltransferase was characterized by mining ests from the developing seeds of saponaria vaccaria  <cit> . the licorice-amyrin 11-oxidase gene, which plays a key role in the biosynthesis of the triterpene sweetener glycyrrhizin, was identified from the ests generated from the stolons of glycyrrhiza uralensis  <cit> . in addition, ests are a rich source of gene-derived molecular markers  which will be used for germplasm breeding or physical mapping  <cit> . the next-generation sequencing  technologies improve sequencing depth and render large-scale est projects more feasible  <cit> .

herein we present the results of the study designed to characterize the transcriptome of p. notoginseng root using ngs technology based on  <dig> gs flx titanium platform. our ultimate goal is to discover the candidate genes that encode enzymes in the triterpene saponin biosynthetic pathway and provide an overview of transcriptome, as well as produce molecular markers of est-ssrs for facilitation the marker-assisted breeding of this species.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing and sequence assembly
a one-quarter  <dig> gs flx titanium run representing the cdna library of 4-year old p. notoginseng root produced  <dig>  reads with an average length of  <dig> bp . after trimming adaptor sequences and removing those reads shorter than  <dig> bp, a total of  <dig>  reads were assembled into  <dig>  unique sequences including  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons . the lengths of contigs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp with average size of  <dig> bp . the size distributions for these reads and contigs are shown in figure  <dig>  singletons, which represent unique transcripts expressed at low levels in the samples and with only one read, exhibited an average length of  <dig> bp in p. notoginseng 454-est dataset . the length of these unique sequences was sufficient to enable annotations with high accuracy  <cit> . an overview of  <dig> sequencing and assembly for p. notoginseng was summarized in table  <dig> 

a the total number of contigs and singletons.

unique sequence annotation and highly expressed transcript analyses
the annotation for p. notoginseng unique sequences was based on sequence similarity searches against public databases. these databases included swissprot, kegg, the arabidopsis information resource , ncbi non-redundant protein , and ncbi non-redundant nucleotide  database. the number and percentage of the annotated unique sequences were summarized in additional file  <dig>  in total,  <dig>   p. notoginseng unique sequences were annotated and the remaining  unique sequences had no match to any sequences in the public databases . the annotation rate for p. notoginseng unique sequences is similar to that of p. quinquefolius root  <cit>  and p. ginseng root  <cit>  transcriptomes. the comparisons of the  <dig>  p. notoginseng unique sequences with all the p. quinquefolius  <cit>  and p. ginseng  <cit>  unique sequences derived from  <dig> sequencing using blast search  were performed. the result of the comparison between p. notoginseng and p. quinquefolius  <cit>  unique sequences showed that  <dig>  p. notoginseng unique sequences had sequence similarity to p. quinquefolius unique sequences, and the remained  <dig>  unique sequences were the p. notoginseng special transcripts. similarly, a total of  <dig>  p. notoginseng unique sequences had sequence similarity to p. ginseng unique sequences  <cit> , and the rest  <dig>  unique sequences were the p. notoginseng special transcripts.

the abundance of a transcript in a cdna library from specific tissues/organs generally corresponds to its expression level in the original biological sample, which can indicate the ongoing biological processes  <cit> . the top  <dig> most frequent unique transcripts in the cdna library of the 4-year old p. notoginseng root were shown in table  <dig>  the most abundant p. notoginseng transcript  had no hit to any sequences of the public databases. the transcripts encoding enzymes associated with sugar and energy metabolism were highly expressed in this cdna library, including  <dig> -alpha-glucan-branching enzyme protein, sucrose synthase isoform, and formate dehydrogenase . the abundance of these transcripts was consistent with the fact that starch is the major constituent in the p. notoginseng root. it is noteworthy that three transcripts encoding the key enzymes of acetyl-coa acetyltransferase , squalene epoxidase  and dammarenediol synthase  were also abundant in p. notoginseng root . these enzymes play important roles in triterpene saponin biosynthesis, particularly for ds, which is the first committed enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of major triterpene saponins. in comparison, ds was more abundant in p. notoginseng root than in p. quinquefolius  <cit>  and p. ginseng root  <cit> . the high expression levels of these transcripts encoding ds indicated that triterpene saponin biosynthesis is active in the growth stage of 4-year old of this species. therefore, the genes  involved in the downstream of triterpene saponin biosynthetic pathway are likely to be abundant in this 454-est dataset. in addition, several transcripts encoding heat shock proteins, which have the functions in the abiotic stress response in plants  <cit> , were also expressed highly in p. notoginseng root .

go analysis and kegg assignment
the go annotation describes gene products according to their associated molecular functions, cellular components, and biological processes, illustrating the broad overview of the groups of genes cataloged in transcriptome  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  p. notoginseng unique sequences were assigned with go terms based on sequence similarity to proteins in tair database . in cellular component group, the unique sequences related to the golgi apparatus, mitochondria, ribosome, and cell wall were well-represented categories . the transcripts belonging to the major subgroups of molecular function category included protein binding, kinase activity, and receptor binding or activity . the best-represented groups of biological processes were response to abiotic or biotic stimuli, protein metabolism, cell organization and biogenesis . these go annotations provide a comprehensive information on transcript functions of p. notoginseng.

the kegg assignments provide an alternative functional annotation of genes associated biochemical pathways with their corresponding enzyme commission  numbers  <cit> .  <dig>  p. notoginseng unique sequences were assigned to kegg annotations based on sequence similarity searches against the kegg database. a total of  <dig>  unique sequences among the  <dig>  annotated sequences were assigned to biochemical pathways . the remaining  unique sequences were not assigned to any known biochemical pathway . in detail, a total of  <dig>  unique sequences were assigned to the metabolic pathways, including the well-represented pathways of amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites . the number of unique sequences involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites was shown in additional file  <dig>  in particular, the transcripts encoding most of all the known enzymes  involved in the triterpene saponin biosynthesis were discovered in this 454-est dataset, including acetyl-coa acetyltransferase , hmg-coa reductase , mevalonate kinase , phosphomevalonate kinase , mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase , ipp isomerase , geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase , farnesyl diphosphate synthase , squalene synthase , squalene epoxidase , and dammarenediol-ii synthase  . pathways related to genetic information processing, protein families, and cellular processes were also well represented by p. notoginseng unique sequences .

ssr detection
simple sequence repeats  are the most feasible genetic markers for plant breeding and genetic applications  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  putative ssr motifs were identified from  <dig>  p. notoginseng unique sequences with  <dig> %  frequency . the frequency of ssrs identified among p. notoginseng 454-ests was similar to that of some dicotyledonous species  <cit> . these motifs included di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotides with the lengths ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. among the ssr-containing unique sequences, the majority  had a single ssr motif in every sequence.

the di-nucleotide motifs were the most abundant in 454-ests, which is similar to results obtained from other plants  <cit> . the occurrence of di- and tri-nucleotide ssr motifs and the number of repeats were presented in table  <dig>  with a frequency of over sixty percent , di-nucleotides were about two times more abundant than tri-nucleotides , followed by tetra-nucleotides  and penta- and hexa-nucleotides . among the di-nucleotide repeat classes, ag/ga/ct/tc  was the most frequent dimer motif. other frequent dimer motifs included at/ta and ac/ca/gt/tg . the cg repeats were very infrequent in the plant , which is consistent with previous observations  <cit> . among the tri-nucleotide repeats, aag/gaa/aga/ctt/ttc/tct was the largest repeat class followed by atc/cat/tca/gat/atg/tga and agc/cag/gca/tgc/ctg/gct . our findings indicated that unique sequences containing ssr markers were indeed abundant in p. notoginseng. in particular, several ssr motifs were linked with the unique sequences encoding enzymes  involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis . these unique sequence-derived markers generated in this study represent a valuable genetic resource for future studies of this species as well as related panax species.

discovery of transcripts encoding putative transcription factors in p. notoginseng
transcription factors, the sequence-specific dna-binding proteins, play important roles in the regulation of gene expression in response to developmental programs and environmental changes in plants  <cit> . based on the searches of automated predictions using inter-pro, a total of  <dig> p. notoginseng unique sequences representing putative homologs belonging to different transcription factor  families , covering the arf, aux/iaa, b <dig>  myb, basic helix-loop-helix , bzip, homeobox, homeodomain-like/related, pathogenesis-related/erf, wrky and zinc finger family proteins . many protein members of the myb, bzip and wrky transcription factors have been implicated in the regulation of stress responses  <cit> . the most abundant tf family in p. notoginseng 454-est dataset was the myb family proteins characterized by dna-binding domains. in arabidopsis, the myb family, comprising  <dig> genes, is also one of the largest transcription factor families  <cit> . the homeobox proteins were another set of highly expressed transcription factors in p. notoginseng. homeobox genes regulate various developmental aspects in plants, such as the regulation of stem cell specification and organogenesis  <cit> . the high expression level of myb and homeobox proteins in p. notoginseng may be linked to response to specific habitats and developmental regulation. given that the functions of tfs vary in plants, the putative functions of these transcription factors potentially involved in environmental responses and/or developmental regulation in p. notoginseng will be characterized in a future study. it is noteworthy that the discovery of these candidate tfs in our 454-est dataset may provide useful information for future research.

candidate genes encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of triterpene saponins
discovery of the transcripts encoding the known enzymes invioved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis
most of all the known enzymes involved in mva pathway for triterpene saponin biosynthesis were discovered in p. notoginseng 454-est dataset . as shown in figure  <dig>  the oxidosqualene is a precursor in the biosynthesis of triterpenoids in higher plants  <cit> . the cyclization of  <dig> -oxidosqualene, catalyzed by oscs , is the rate-limited step for triterpene saponin biosynthesis . after the cyclization, the hydroxylation and glycosidation, which are catalyzed by cyp450s and ugts in turn, play important roles in the production of various triterpene saponins . dammarane-type saponins are major saponins in p. notoginseng root. ds participates in the cyclization of  <dig> -oxidosqualene to form the dammarane skeletons in p. ginseng  <cit> . it is noteworthy that the transcript for the full-length p. notoginseng ds  was found in the cdna library. the alignment of amino acid sequences of ds from p. ginseng, p. notoginseng, and p. quinquefolius was shown in figure  <dig>  ds sequences of p. quinquefolium and p. notoginseng were deposited in ncbi genbank with accession no. gu <dig> and gu <dig>  respectively. all three dss have  <dig> amino acid residues and display high similarity. at the protein level, dss exhibit  <dig> % identity between p. ginseng and p. quinquefolius,  <dig> % identity between p. quinquefolius and p. notoginseng, and  <dig> % identity between p. ginseng and p. notoginseng, indicating that p. ginseng and p. quinquefolius are more closely related. this conclusion agrees with that drawn from the alignment of trnk and 18s rrna sequences  <cit> .

the oleanane-type saponin  has not been detected in p. notoginseng based on the phytochemical studies  <cit> . surprisingly, two p. notoginseng singleton sequences  matched to β-as of panax ginseng. the presence of the β-ass in p. notoginseng was further confirmed by rt-pcr and the pcr products were sequenced . the existence of the transcripts for β-ass in p. notoginseng was seemingly conflicted with previous reports claiming that oleanane-type ginsenosides do not exist in p. notoginseng  <cit> . therefore, we presumed that either oleanane-type ginsenosides were present in p. notoginseng at levels too low to be detected phytochemically, or oleanane-type ginsenosides in fact did not exist in p. notoginseng, despite the presence of β-as, might due to the lack of biosynthetic genes downstream of β-as.

discovery of the candidate cyp450s and ugts might be involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis by phylogenetic analysis
characterization of specific cyp450s or ugts involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis in panax genus will facilitate to elucidation of the triterpene saponin biosynthetic pathway. cyp450s are generally involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoids, sterols, lignins, hormones, fatty acids, pigments, and phytoalexins in plants  <cit> . some cyp450s are proposed to participate in the oxidation of the dammarane skeleton at c- <dig> and the other at c- <dig> toward the production of protopanaxadiol and protopanaxatriol, respectively  <cit> . previous studies have characterized cyp88d <dig> from glycyrrhiza uralensis   <cit>  and cyp93e <dig> from glycine max   <cit> , both of which were involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis. therefore, the cyp450s belonging to cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> clan might be involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis in panax genus. glycosylation, catalyzed by glycosyltransferases , transfers the activated saccharides to an aglycone substrate in the modification on ginsenoside biosynthesis. this enzymatic conjugation based on glycosylation can stabilize the product and alter its physiological activity  <cit> . the dammarane- and oleanane-type aglycones have ginsenoside bioactivity after the glycosylation catalyzed by ugts. ugt73k <dig> and ugt71g <dig> from medicago truncatula  <cit>  and ugt74m <dig> from saponaria vaccaria  <cit>  have been identified and characterized with functions in triterpene saponin biosynthesis. recently, several cyp450s and ugts were found as candidate genes involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis in p. quinquefolius and p. ginseng in our previous studies  <cit> . particularly, one cyp <dig>  and four ugts  were selected as candidate genes most likely to be involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis based on their meja-inducible and tissue specific expression patterns in p. quinquefolius  <cit> .

in this study, a total of  <dig> cyp <dig>  and  <dig> gt  unique sequences were found in the p. notoginseng cdna library. as reported for p. ginseng and other plants, enzymes in the same biosynthetic pathway are usually co-expressed  <cit> . hence, ds was expressed abundantly  in the root of p. notoginseng, indicating that other genes in the triterpene saponin biosynthetic pathway might also expressed at higher levels in the p. notoginseng root. based on this knowledge, cyp450- and ugt-unique sequences that contain more than  <dig> reads from the p. notoginseng root cdna library were found as candidate enzymes involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis. thus,  <dig> cyp450s and  <dig> ugts were selected, among which  <dig> cyp450s and  <dig> ugts had full-length sequences after assembly and using race  method. the primers used for race were listed in additional file  <dig>  these cdna sequences have been submitted to the ncbi database and given accession number gu997664-gu <dig> for cyp450s and gu997656-gu <dig> for ugts.

the phylogenetic relationship between the <dig> full-length cyp450s of p. notoginseng and characterized cyp450s from other plants was depicted in figure  <dig>  four cyp450s  belonged to the group representing the cyp <dig> clan which comprises cyp88d <dig> from g. uralensis, a licorice β-amyrin 11-oxidase with a key role in the biosynthesis of the triterpene sweetener glycyrrhizin  <cit>  . thus, the four cyp450s constituted a subgroup and were related to cyp88d <dig> . interestingly, the transcript of pn <dig> had high identity to the p. quinquefolius candidate cyp <dig>   <cit>  , which was likely to be involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis. seven cyp450s  belonged to the group representing the cyp <dig> clan . it is noteworthy that pn <dig> was phylogenetically close to cyp93e <dig> , which was the first triterpene hydroxylase identified from a plant species  <cit> . therefore, pn <dig> and pn <dig> were lead candidate cyp450s involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis.

phylogenetic analysis using an unrooted distance tree showed the relationship of p. notoginseng ugt sequences to other functionally characterized members of plant ugt families . three ugts  belonged to the group consisting of triterpene glycosyltransferases  from medicago truncatula . among them, pn <dig> was regarded as a lead candidate ugt responsible for triterpene saponin biosynthesis, because of its close relation to ugt71g <dig>  characterization of these candidate cyp450s and ugts will pave the way to illustrate the biosynthetic pathways of triterpene saponins in p. notoginseng and other related panax species. although many of candidate genes involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis were discovered in this study, the functional identification of these genes has not be carried out in this study. they will be the focus of study in the future

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a large-scale 454-est investigation of p. notoginseng root was performed based on  <dig> pyrosequencing. this 454-est dataset from p. notoginseng root contribute significantly to provide a large number of transcripts for gene discovery in this medicinal plant. the description of the expressed genes and distribution of gene functions was illustrated according to go analysis and kegg assignment. a number of genes involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis, including cytochrome p450s and glycosyltransferases, were discovered in our est dataset. more importantly, a handful of candidate cyp450s and ugts that are most likely to be involved in the biosynthesis of triterpene saponins were found based on phylogenetic analysis. many transcription factors and est-ssr markers were identified as well. these data will provide comprehensive information on gene discovery, transcriptome profiling, transcriptional regulation, and molecular markers for p. notoginseng. this study will contribute to further improvements on this medicinal plant through marker-assisted breeding or genetic engineering on this species as well as for other medicinal plants in the araliaceae family.
