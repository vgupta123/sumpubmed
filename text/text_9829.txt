BACKGROUND
rna-protein interactions are pivotal for many fundamental cellular functions such as transcriptional regulation, splicing and protein synthesis. thus the identification of rna binding sites is essential for the understanding of a variety of biological processes. in general, computational methods to predict interface residues for an individual protein fall into two major categories: sequence-based and structure-based. most published studies have extensively used the information derived from protein sequence.

one of the earliest attempts to predict binding residues in rna-protein interfaces was performed by jeong et al.  <cit> . they utilized a neural network with amino acid type and secondary structure information as input features. the method achieved a matthews correlation coefficient  of  <dig>  for 10-fold cross-validation on a data set with  <dig> chains from  <dig> protein-complexes. a post processing step  improved the accuracy further but required information usually not available in the query phase  <cit> .

furthermore, jeong et al.  <cit>  studied different methods to calculate profiles and improved their previous results  <cit>  by utilizing weighted psi-blast profiles to a mcc of  <dig> . however, they used a data set containing  <dig> proteins with sequence similarities up to 70% and the accuracy was not calculated via strict cross-validation tests.

wang et al.  <cit>  applied support vector machines  with rbf kernels and artificial neural networks  to predict dna and rna binding residues. sequence features such as side chain pka value, the kyte-dolittle hydrophobicity scale and molecular mass were exploited. they reported a specificity of  <dig> % and a sensitivity of  <dig> % with five-fold cross-validation on residue-level. by including additional features such as accessible surface area and conservation score  <cit> , they improved their previous results. using svms, an auc of  <dig>   on a data set of  <dig> non-redundant protein chains was achieved. down-sampling was applied to balance positive and negative samples of the data set, which resulted in better performance in comparison to the unbalanced case.

kim et al.  <cit>  studied the propensities of individual amino acids and amino acid pairs in rna-protein interfaces. they reported 50% sensitivity and 57% specificity for a method that combined averaged singlet and doublet propensities.

a recent predictor by terribilini et al.  <cit>  utilized a naive bayes classifier to predict the residues involved in rna-protein interaction based on amino acid propensities. on a larger data set, with lower sequence similarity than jeong's  <cit> , a correlation coefficient of  <dig>  was achieved . surprisingly, additional information such as secondary structure, relative accessible surface area, sequence entropy, hydrophobicity or electrostatic potential was not found to improve the prediction accuracy. in a comparison of terribilini's and jeong's methods, both predictors achieved very similar accuracies on jeong's data set.

kumar et al.  <cit> , using a svm with a second order polynomial kernel and psi-blast  <cit>  profiles as input features, achieved an mcc of  <dig>   on jeong's data set  <cit>  . on a larger, more recent data set  with lower sequence similarity  by wang et al.  <cit> , a significantly lower mcc of  <dig>  was reached due to the overestimation on a redundant data set.

the focus of a recent paper by shazman et al.  <cit>  was on the differentiation of non-binding and rna-binding proteins based on electrostatic properties - not on the prediction of binding residues per se. however, they also measured the overlap between positively charged surface patches and the actual binding sites and found dramatic variations ranging from 0% to 100%, indicating that positive charge alone is a comparitvely weak predictor for binding residues.

a very high prediction accuracy, with a mcc of  <dig> , has been reported very recently by spriggs et al.  <cit>  on a data set comprised of  <dig> rna-binding proteins , derived from kumar's data set  <cit> . it is however to note that this data set is small and only weakly redundancy reduced . a svm with an rbf kernel was utilized to analyze input features such as sequence profiles, interface propensities, accessibility and hydrophobicity. on an independent test set the predictor achieved a mcc of  <dig> .

with the constantly increasing number of known 3d structures of rna binding proteins, it is possible to use more and more structural features to leverage accurate prediction. recently, chen and lim  <cit>  investigated physicochemical and geometrical properties, together with conservation score obtained from sequence alignments, to predict rna-binding sites. however, it is difficult to compare this approach with previous methods based on prediction performance.

in this study, we systematically study sequential, graph-topological and spatial features with respect to their predictive power for the identification of residues involved in rna-protein interaction. we have implemented two methods based on naïve bayes classifiers and support vector machines, using residue psi-blast profiles and sequential neighbors as input to predict rna binding sites. the accuracy of these classifiers serves as a baseline that reflects the performance of sequence-based methods.

secondly, we study different graph-theoretic properties that may be associated with interface residues, where protein structures are represented as graphs derived from residue contacts. features such as closeness centrality and betweenness centrality were found to be useful in predicting enzyme active sites and ligand-binding sites  <cit> , identifying critical residues for protein function  <cit>  and analyzing protein-protein interactions  <cit> . however, it is not known yet what types of graph-theoretic features are correlated with protein-rna interaction and therefore contributing to the prediction.

by carefully examining seven topological features, we found betweenness centrality to be the most predictive feature, which can be used to enhance prediction accuracy. instead of using sequential neighbors to encode the input feature vector as in sequence-based methods, we utilize structural information by taking into account network topological or spatial neighbors to improve the prediction performance. the prediction accuracy of our method has been evaluated on two large, non-redundant data sets and a peak auc of  <dig>  was reached . we furthermore created a new independent test set , where our method achieved an auc of  <dig> .

RESULTS
we have investigated sequential, graph-theoretic and spatial features that are predictive for binding residues in rna-protein interfaces. in particular, we were interested in estimating the impact of structural information on the prediction accuracy in comparison to a purely sequence based approach.

predictive power of amino acid indices
as a first step, we measured the predictive power for binding residues of all amino acid indices, available in the aaindex database  <cit> . for each residue in a protein chain the corresponding value within an aaindex scale was selected. the predictive power of a scale was then calculated as the area under the roc curve   <cit>  over all residues within the rb <dig> data set, which contains  <dig> protein-rna complexes with annotated binding residues. note that no classifier and therefore no cross-validation scheme is required to compute the auc estimates at this stage. the ten scales with the highest aucs are listed in table  <dig>  residues involved in rna-protein interfaces are known to show a preference for hydrophobic amino acids  <cit> , which is reflected by the results in table  <dig>  cowr <dig>  jurd <dig> and rosm <dig> are essentially hydrophobicity scales. similarly, scales that discriminate between inside and outside residues  and scales related to the partition coefficient , which is a measure for lipophilicity  <cit> , are most predictive for interface residues.

table of the ten amino acid indices with the highest predictive power  on the rb <dig> data set.

scale tans <dig> is derived from a one-dimensional short-range interaction model for specific sequence copolymers of amino acids and is related to protein conformation  <cit> . it may appear as a high ranking scale due to a bias of the sample set toward aminoacyl-trna synthetases, many of which are allosteric in nature.

the highest ranking scale guod <dig>  <cit>  describes the retention coefficient  for peptide nucleic acids , which are synthetic biopolymers chemically similar to dna and rna.

although table  <dig> does not reveal novel characteristics of interface residues, it establishes a base line for the prediction accuracy of classifiers based on single residue features. previous work has shown that taking the neighborhood of an interface residue into account significantly improves the accuracy for classifying a residue as interacting or non-interacting  <cit> . consequently we studied three different types of neighborhood patches  to incorporate neighboring residues and evaluated the prediction performance in dependence of the patch size and patch type.

predictive power of residue patches
sequential patches  of size n for sequential data are constructed by extracting the n residues nearest  to the residue , which is to be classified. for topological and spatial features the definition of a patch of neighboring residues requires more consideration. we define a spatial patch of size n as the set of the n residues with the smallest euclidean distance between their cα-atoms and the cα-atom of the residue in the center of the patch. this approach was also used by tjong and zhou to predict protein-dna binding sites  <cit> . a topological patch is similarly defined by the n vertices with the smallest geodesic distances  to the center vertex. the underlying graph is thereby derived from a map of residue contacts .

to construct a feature vector with ordered elements from a spatial or topological patch, the features associated with the residues or nodes of the patch were sorted according to distance. for a topological patch the geodesic distances, and for a spatial patch the euclidean distances to the patch center were employed. in the case of equal distances, the sequential distance within the primary sequence was used as an additional criterion.

to achieve optimal classification accuracy and to identify the typical size of the neighborhood that contributes to the binding propensity of an interface residue, we measured the prediction accuracy for the different patch types for patch sizes varying from  <dig> to  <dig> residues.

prediction performance for different patch types  and classifiers  on rb <dig> data set, tested by five-fold cross-validation. c-value for svm was  <dig>  and γ-value of rbf-kernel was  <dig> . cost factor was assigned as  <dig>  to compensate for the unbalanced class distribution.

the results confirm that the svms significantly  outperform the naive bayes approach. furthermore, the spatial patch performed generally better than the topological patch, which performed better than the sequential patch. however, the differences in prediction accuracy were small, which can be explained by the fact that there is a considerable overlap of residues between the different patch types. for instance, in the case of the topological and spatial patch 80% of the patch residues overlap.

the highest auc of  <dig>   was achieved by a svm with a spatial patch. while the absolute improvements in auc in relation to the naive bayes approach are small, the mcc is increased by approximately 10%. however, taking into account that the svm is several orders of magnitude slower to train and test, the naive bayes approach is a valid alternative for large scale data analysis.

predictive power of graph-theoretical and geometrical features
here, we aimed to identify features besides the profile that have high predictive power for interface residues, with the final goal to improve performance by combining highly predictive features. for this purpose we compared the prediction accuracy of the best amino acid propensity scale, the retention coefficient  , with structural and topological features, such as accessible surface area  and betweenness centrality .

the results presented in figure  <dig> indicate a higher performance for features that consider the neighborhood of the residue to classify. in addition to feature values for individual residues we therefore also calculated averaged feature values over patches of residues. note that in both cases only a single feature value for the residue of interest is computed. consequently, the predictive power  of a feature could be calculated without involvement of a classifier and time-consuming cross-validation tests. table  <dig> lists the prediction performance  of the features evaluated on the rb <dig> data set. taking the peak values from figure  <dig>  we chose a patch size of  <dig> residues for sequential patches and a size of  <dig> for topological or spatial patches. patch types and sizes are annotated in the related table columns. a patch size of one indicates the evaluation of a feature for the center residue only .

predictive power  of features on rb <dig> data set. patch type and patch size are listed in columns two and three. a missing patch type and patch size of one indicate features evaluated for individual residues .

while the optimal patch sizes identified in figure  <dig> are likely to be a reasonable choice, they are not necessarily optimal for features other than psi-blast profiles. however, to allow for a stringent comparison of different features, we limited our study to these two patch sizes and did not optimize the patch sizes individually for all the features explored.

note that topological features, such as betweenness centrality  for instance, are calculated based on the entire contact map of a protein chain. if a patch is used, the feature value for the center residue is computed as the average over all bc values of the patch residues. a detailed description of the evaluated features is provided in the material and methods section.

the results in table  <dig> show that features averaged over patches generally achieve aucs higher than or comparable to features for individual residues . the only exceptions are the accessible surface area  and the relative accessible surface area , which both show slightly better performance for individual residues.

we also compared the performance of averaged retention coefficients  for the different patch types and the results show that spatial and topological patches are superior  to the same feature calculated over the sequential patch .

the solvent accessible surface area  measures whether a residue is located on protein surface and has been proven to be highly correlated with interface residues  <cit> . we have examined four different versions of accessible surface area: asa and rasa for individual residues  or averaged over a spatial patch . we found that the utility of the absolute asa for individual residues yields the best result .

because a sole feature cannot accurately predict interface residues, combining features with high predictive power is a standard method to improve the overall accuracy. however, such a combination is only successful if the features to combine are not redundant. all graph-theoretic features in table  <dig> are essentially centrality measures, which are typically highly correlated. we therefore picked only averaged betweenness centrality  and calculated the correlation coefficients between abc and the two other top ranking features, such as asa and arc. the highest correlation coefficient of  <dig>  was identified between asa and arc. asa and abc showed the lowest correlation , and the correlation coefficient for abc and arc was  <dig> . the correlation between the three features was regarded as sufficiently low to justify their combination.

combination of highly predictive features
we studied the predictive power of features by averaging over patches of residues, which may not fully reflect their power, but is an effective way for feature selection. to gain an increase in prediction accuracy, we used machine learning methods such as naive bayes classifiers and support vector machines to combine the feature values of the residues within a patch.

this is achieved by encoding a patch of residues as a feature vector, where each residue within the patch is represented by the corresponding feature value or values. for instance, a patch of size  <dig> with psi-blast profile and retention coefficient as features is encoded as a vector containing  <dig> ×  =  <dig> elements. as described in section methods, the residues  are sorted according to their distance to the center residue.

we have observed changes in prediction accuracy when including more and more information, starting with information that can be derived from the primary sequence only, over topological information, up to structural information. to this purpose we assessed the prediction accuracy of different combinations of the psi-blast profile feature with the three best performing features , identified in the previous section. table  <dig> shows the results of this comparison, using a naive bayes classifier  and support vector machine  with an rbf-kernel . from table  <dig> three trends become obvious. firstly, as expected, the more information is included the higher is the prediction accuracy. secondly, the support vector machine consistently outperforms  the naive bayes classifier . and thirdly, by combining information from different sources, higher prediction accuracy can be obtained.

predictive power of combined features on rb <dig> data set using five-fold cross-validation tests. c-value for svm was  <dig>  and γ-value of rbf-kernel was  <dig> . cost factor was  <dig> .

the maximal auc of  <dig>  was achieved by a svm, exploiting psi-blast profiles, asa, bc and rc as input features . this is a significantly  higher accuracy than the best auc of  <dig> , accomplished by using profile information only . figure  <dig> displays the roc curves for these two models. all other performance measures also show significant improvement: mcc increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> , sensitivity from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, and specificity raised from  <dig> % to  <dig> %.

there is no statistically significant difference in auc between classifiers that utilize profile information only, and classifiers that take profiles and the retention coefficient as input - though the latter achieve marginally higher aucs. this is explained by the fact that the profile already describes the amino acid propensity of interface residues and the additional retention coefficient, therefore, contributes little. we also evaluated the prediction performance of other classifiers such as knn, c <dig> , linear svm and polynomial svm but found the svm with the rbf-kernel to perform best . in addition, we studied methods to balance the sample set by removal of redundant samples, down-sampling or both methods combined. but while the training time could be reduced, the resulting prediction accuracies were clearly inferior .

comparison with other methods
the rb <dig> data set is larger and more diverse in content, and the prediction accuracies are therefore typically lower than those for smaller data sets with higher sequence similarity that are utilized in most other studies. to compare our results with previous evaluations we measured the performance of our classifier on the rb <dig> data set, which is almost identical to the rb <dig> data set used by terribilini et al.  <cit>  and cheng et al.  <cit> , and similar in size and sequence similarity to a data set consisting of  <dig> chains used by kumar et al.  <cit>  and other authors.

we furthermore submitted the sequences of our independent rb <dig> data set to the pprint prediction server, developed by kumar et al.  <cit> . an evaluation of the prediction performance of the rnabindr server  <cit>  on the rb <dig> data set was omitted, since rnabindr matches a query sequence against a database of all known structures , resulting in next to perfect predictions for known sequences.

comparison with other authors for data sets similar to rb <dig>  sequential patch for profile and profile+rc, spatial patch for profile+asa+bc+rc.

using profile information over a sequential patch on rb <dig> our svm based classifier achieves a mcc of  <dig>  , which may be comparable with the reported mcc of  <dig>   <cit> . however, their value was optimized by tuning a threshold for classifying rna binding residues. accordingly, the specificity and sensitivity were 51% and 38%. in contrast, our simulations obtained the specificity 76% and the sensitivity 70%, which are considerably better than the above reported results.

in comparison to kumar's result our performance estimates are clearly higher, which we attribute to differences in data sets and a comprehensive optimization of patch size and classifier parameters. when all features  are exploited and a spatial patch of size  <dig> is used, the prediction accuracy of our svm based classifier increases to a mcc of  <dig>  .

the prediction results of the pprint server  <cit>  on the rb <dig> data set highlight how difficult the comparison of classifier performances is. pprint achieves an mcc of  <dig> , which is much higher than our mcc of  <dig> , but both classifiers are of very similar architecture . the mcc however represents only a single working point on the roc curve and the auc  of our classifier is considerably higher  than the auc of  <dig>  achieved by pprint. pprint allows the user to define a threshold to shift the working point, e.g. to balance sensitivity and specificity. we noted however that the classifier showed very high specificity despite the fact that we used the default setting , which was reported to balance sensitivity and specificity  <cit> . to interpret the discrepancy in performance, it furthermore has to be taken into account that the rb <dig> data set is redundancy reduced against the training set of our classifier, which is not the case for the sequence set utilized by pprint, possibly causing an advantageous bias for pprint in this comparison.

the second highest prediction performance with an mcc of  <dig>  has been reported by spriggs et al.  <cit>  using a svm with an rbf kernel and only sequence features as inputs such as sequence profiles, interface propensities , predicted accessibility  and hydrophobicity . the corresponding auc of  <dig>  is even higher than the best auc of  <dig>  our classifier achieves, despite the fact that we exploit structural information in addition to sequence data and using an identical classifier architecture. the discrepancy in performance can be traced back to the data the classifier is evaluated on. the rnaset <dig> utilized by spriggs et al. is smaller and only weekly redundancy reduced  while the rb <dig> data set used to train our classifier is larger and strongly redundancy reduced, with no more than 30% sequence similarity.

the effect of redundancy reduction  on prediction accuracy is documented by cheng et al.  <cit> . they compared the performance of their classifier on three data sets  with different degrees of redundancy reduction, confirming that the prediction accuracy increases with the degree of sequence similarity.

recently, cheng et al.  <cit>  introduced smoothed sequence profiles to take the dependency between neighboring residues into account and reported large improvement. smoothed profiles adopted a simple approach to obtain their values by averaging the normal profile values in a certain window. we applied this approach to our svm and naïve bayes classifiers. however, in both cases, we did not observe improvements with respect to prediction accuracy.

the highest prediction performance of our classifier with a mcc of  <dig>  and an auc of  <dig>  on the rb <dig> data set was achieved, using a svm and all features . it is however to note that the improvement in prediction accuracy by adding topological or structural features to the purely sequence based profile information is comparatively small .

CONCLUSIONS
residues that participate in rna-protein interfaces show different characteristics, which can be derived from sequence, structure, graph-topology, and physicochemical properties. previous work studied different residue properties in protein-rna interfaces, such as the amino acid doublet propensity  <cit> , electrostatics, conservation and surface cleft arrangement  <cit> , as well as atomic packing patterns  <cit> . in addition, many authors used machine learning methods to predict protein rna-binding sites directly from sequences and their performance has been strictly examined on large data sets with cross-validation or on independent data sets. aggregation of these types of features with already developed sequence-based methods will gain higher prediction performance.

in this study, we particularly examined the graph-theoretic properties of residue contact maps derived from protein structures and found a number of features, such as betweenness centrality and status, which show higher or compatible predictive power to already known structural features such as the asa. taking them into account, sequence-based methods can improve prediction accuracy, and the highest auc of  <dig>   was achieved by a support vector machine with an rbf-kernel, using a spatial patch of size  <dig>  and profiles, accessible surface area, betweenness-centrality and retention coefficient as input. the blind test, deemed as the most strict test, using newly solved protein-rna complexes to test the prediction performance gives an auc of  <dig>   on the rb <dig> data set.

we also compared the prediction performance of naive bayes classifiers and support vector machines and found that the latter generally improve accuracies  by about 5%. however, the naïve bayes method requires less computing time and therefore remains an attractive choice for large scale data analysis. we implemented a web application  to predict binding residues in protein-rna interfaces from sequence information . the data sets we generated and utilized for our experiments can be downloaded from the same web page.

rna-protein recognition is known to be a surprisingly complicated and diverse process, which has been investigated by different experimental techniques and theoretical methods. those studies provide a variety of information on different aspects, useful to build up a systemic description of this important protein function. in this study, one one hand, we exploit different resources to improve the prediction accuracy. on the other hand, we employ network theory to describe the collective properties of interface residues, which may more accurately reflect the nature of binding process as different interactions in the interfaces are largely responsible for binding affinity and specificity. finding more accurate interpretation of those interactions is crucial for this problem, which forms our future research.
