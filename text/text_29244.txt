BACKGROUND
cladribine  is a purine analogue that entered clinical testing fifteen years ago, with major activity in the treatment of b- and t-cell lymphoid malignancies. cladribine has an outstanding therapeutic activity against hairy cell leukemia, a disease in which the drug induces long-lasting complete remissions in the vast majority of patients treated. the activity of cladribine has also been demonstrated in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia  non-hodgkin's lymphoma, cutaneous t-cell lymphoma and myeloid leukemia. cladribine and the other newer purine analogues are unique, when compared to traditional antimetabolites, in that they are equally cytotoxic to both dividing and resting cells  <cit> . cladribine is usually administered at  <dig>  mg/kg daily as a continuous intravenous infusion over  <dig> days. however, pharmacokinetic studies supporting the use of intermittent intravenous  infusions have shown a long terminal half-life of cladribine after a 2-hour infusion with the same anti tumour activity seen with continuous iv infusion  <cit> . the pharmacokinetic profile of oral administration of cladribine resembles that of a 2-hour iv infusion, with a bioavailability of 37–51%  <cit> . subcutaneous administration gives a high peak concentration of short duration with an area under the curve  identical to that of the iv infusion and a bioavailability of 100%.

the primary aim of the study was to evaluate the population distribution of pharmacokinetic parameters in patients undergoing treatment with cladribine and to detect the influence of different covariates on the pharmacokinetic parameters. this analysis was performed in order to evaluate the plasma concentration-time profiles in relation to previously presented pharmacokinetic data and to elucidate the possibilities to create a better tailoring of cladribine dosing.

RESULTS
the population pharmacokinetic analysis of cladribine was based on  <dig> plasma concentrations obtained from  <dig> individuals. the observed plasma concentrations of cladribine versus time are presented in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  the initial runs carried out were aimed at finding a base model . a three compartment structural model best described the time course of plasma concentrations of cladribine for all patients and was therefore chosen for the present analysis.

the final disposition model is described as follows: a three compartment model with interindividual variability on clearance , central and peripheral volumes of distribution , intercompartmental clearances , and with a proportional residual error model for residual variability.

the final population parameter estimates based on the model are given in table  <dig>  the clearance in the typical patient was calculated to be  <dig>  l/h, with relative standard error  of  <dig>  % while the interindividual variability, as expressed by the coefficient of variation, was 54%. diagnostic plots of the observed and population model predicted concentrations after iv infusion, oral and subcutaneous administrations are shown in figure 3a–c.

the oral data were best described with a first order absorption without lag time. the bioavailability was found to be  <dig>  with rse  <dig> % and the interindividual variability was estimated to be  <dig> % . the estimated value for the absorption rate constant was  <dig>  hour- <dig> with rse 14%. as bioavailability and interindividual variability in f were of particular interest, some additional investigation was performed. first, the 95% confidence interval for interindividual variability in f was obtained using likelihood profiling. this resulted in a  <dig> % confidence interval ranging from 0% to 10%. second, in order to get a broader insight into the first pass metabolism, bioavailability and variability in cl following different administration routes, f was omitted from the model and instead apparent cl and its interindividual variability was estimated separately for each route of administration . the estimated cl for the intravenous route was  <dig>  l/h  while the estimates of the oral cl  was  <dig> l/h . the estimated interindividual variability in cl for the intravenous and oral routes were 59%  and  <dig>  respectively. third, a model allowing correlation between f and cl was tested, but it did not result in any improvements and variability in f was still not appreciable.

for the subcutaneous data the bioavailability was calculated to be close to  <dig> and therefore was fixed to this value, as estimation of this parameter did not result with a significant model improvement. the corresponding result for ka was  <dig>  hour- <dig> with rse  <dig> %.

the terminal half-life was relatively long,  <dig> hours. the half-life for the first distribution phase was calculated to be  <dig>  hour and the corresponding half-life for the second distribution phase was  <dig>  hours.

the highest and the lowest values for terminal half-life were  <dig> hours and  <dig> hours respectively. the corresponding accumulation index, the amount at steady state compared to the corresponding value after the first dose at the same time, was for the highest  <dig>  and for the lowest  <dig> .

none of the covariate relations, included in the generalised additive model, were found to be significant when included in the nonmem model.

discussion
in this study we have evaluated pooled data from  <dig> patients at different centres, receiving different doses of cladribine, administered by three different routes, using different treatment schedules and leaving different numbers of blood samples at different times. to perform this evaluation we used nonlinear mixed effect modelling for the pharmacokinetic analysis of the data. a three compartment structural model best described the time course of plasma concentrations of cladribine, which is also in agreement with previously published individual pharmacokinetic modelling  <cit> . cladribine, administered as an oral solution, was rapidly absorbed and the absorption was best described using a model with first order absorption without lagtime.

we calculated that the bioavailability after oral administration of cladribine was  <dig> % and this value is slightly lower compared to the previous reports of 37–51%  <cit> . the estimate of interindividual variability  in oral bioavailability was surprisingly low, 4%. only seven patients had data following both intravenous and oral administration and even if in theory, bioavailability and variability in bioavailability can be estimated from a parallel group study, the sparsity of crossover data might be one explanation for the negligible value of variability in bioavailability and a lower value for bioavailability.

further, as all variability estimates are based on the nominal dose being exact, deviations from this would inflate variability in pharmacokinetic parameters. therefore, another possible explanation is that the apparent lack of variability in f is due to that the variability between the nominal and actual dose is larger for intravenous administration than for oral administration. variability between nominal and exact dose will arise in the manufacturing process, but may also occur due to deviations between nominal and actual volume infused and number of tablets administered.

last, estimates of variability in bioavailability obtained by traditional non-compartmental methods are upwards biased as any error in determining the auc following intravenous or oral administration will be translated into an individual bioavailability estimate differing from the true one. thus, even a drug without variability in bioavailability will appear to have variability when this is estimated by classical two-stage methods. nonlinear mixed effects methods are in general showing less bias in variability estimates than the classical two-stage methods  <cit> . many factors contribute to the bioavailability of cladribine, but the low variability in bioavailability was confirmed with classic pharmacokinetics , which is also in agreement with previous analyses  <cit> . consequently, the variability in auc after oral administration is of the same magnitude as after intravenous administration, as the variability in cl is more pronounced than that for the bioavailability table  <dig> 

to reach the general circulation, a drug given orally must pass through the liver via the portal system. a shorter onset and a more intense response may occur when giving a compound orally, rather than as a 2-hour intravenous infusion, if the compound is rapidly absorbed and undergoes extensive first-pass conversion to an active metabolite more potent than the parent. the metabolite of cladribine, 2-chloroadenine, has  <dig> times lower cytotoxic effect than cladribine, while five times more metabolite is formed after an oral administration compared with after an iv infusion  <cit> .

after subcutaneous administration the bioavailability was found to be 100% with a low interindividual variability less than 1%. these results are in agreement with the previous analysis  <cit> .

for the typical patient,  <dig> % of the elimination is associated with the terminal slope, 11% with the first and 24% with the second slope. although distribution kinetics cannot be ignored, the majority of cladribine elimination is clearly associated with events defined by the terminal phase, which has a mean half-life of  <dig> hours.

it is standard practice in oncology to individualise chemotherapy dosing, and to dose according to bsa or weight, with the aim of reducing the interpatient variability of drug effect and toxicity. however, neither weight nor bsa explains more than a minor part of the variability seen. in this study, the modelling indicates that dosing according to body weight or bsa does not represent any significant improvement as compared to administration a fixed dose to all patients. for a convincing evaluation of dosing cladribine, more patients need to be studied, but the lack of reduction in interindividual variability when entering relationships with body size make it unlikely that body size can explain more than a small portion of the interindividual variability. likewise, it has been shown that bsa fails to standardize the marked interpatient variation in pharmacokinetic variables for most cytotoxic drugs  <cit> . there is no simple satisfactory method for calculating drug dose, and other non-bsa-based dose calculation methods have been proposed and discussed  <cit> . patients with a dose corrected for bsa or weight, but with a low clearance, tend to have an excessive accumulation of the drug and a high risk of toxicity. the amount at any time within the dosing interval at plateau was maximum  <dig>  times and minimum  <dig>  times the values at the corresponding times after a single dose. it seems therefore valuable to adjust the dose according to pharmacodynamic events such as observed toxicity, which is one parameter used in non-bsa-based dose calculation methods to individualise treatment  <cit> . this is possible when patients are treated with repeated courses, e.g. in low-grade lymphomas, but not in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia where only one course of treatment is given.

the reasons why people differ in their responsiveness to drugs are manifold. age, weight, height, disease stage etc. are important because they are sources of variability that can be taken into account. none of the covariates included in this study was found to have a significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of cladribine. in this study no patient with severe reduction of liver- or kidney function was participating. separate studies with such patient groups are warranted.

CONCLUSIONS
as interindividual variability in apparent clearance after oral administration was not significantly higher compared to that following infusion, cladribine could be administered orally instead of intravenously if compensated for its lower bioavailability. individualized dosing on basis of body surface area or weight does not represent an improvement in this study as compared to administering a fixed dose to all patients.
