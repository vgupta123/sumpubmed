BACKGROUND
pheromone-based methods of insect control are essential components of integrated pest management practices worldwide. the pheromones of over  <dig>  insect species are now known, and the pherobase is an updated compilation of pheromones and other behavior-modifying chemicals found in insects  <cit> . common biosynthetic pathways have also been well-cited in many scientific publications over the last two decades, leading to production of species-specific pheromone compounds . the female pheromones of almost all moth species are multicomponent blends of long hydrocarbon chains , unbranched alcohols, and acetates or aldehydes, and are synthesized in the modified epidermal cells  from c <dig> or c <dig> fatty acid precursors  <cit> . a typical moth pheromone biosynthetic pathway begins even before the adult eclosion by releasing pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide  from the brain and transporting it to the pheromone gland , which in turn activates functional group modification enzymes  <cit>  or acetyl-coenzyme a  carboxylase   <cit> . as the first step in pheromone biosynthesis, carboxylation of acetyl-coa to malonyl-coa is catalyzed by acc  <cit> . this is followed by fatty acid synthase  activity to produce saturated fatty acids  using malonyl-coa as the substrate. later, the fatty acyl desaturases  introduce double bonds in the acyl chains, and then, specific β-oxidation enzymes shorten the chains. once specific unsaturated pheromone precursors are formed, the terminal carboxyl group is modified to form one of the functional groups, alcohol, aldehyde or acetate ester , and is catalyzed by fatty acyl reductase , aldehyde reductase  or fatty acetyltransferase , respectively . a variety of desaturases, which introduce double bonds into the acyl at the ∆ <dig>  <cit> , ∆ <dig> , ∆ <dig>  <cit> , ∆ <dig>  <cit>  and ∆ <dig>  <cit>  positions, have been cloned and functionally expressed from many moth species . great progress has also been made in the functional characterization of fars since their discovery in bombyx mori  <cit>  through detailed studies of pheromone evolution and the fars of nine ostrinia spp. , yponomeuta spp.  <cit> , helicoverpa spp. and heliothis spp.  <cit> . however, the molecular characterizations of other critical enzymes in the pheromone biosynthetic pathway, such as acc, fas, and several β-oxidation and acetylation enzymes, have not been characterized at the enzymatic level in insects.

female moths typically start releasing sex pheromones a few days after emergence. in male moths, the pheromone molecule binds to odorant receptor  proteins , signals are transmitted to the central nervous system where they are processed and identified by the brain, messages are then passed to the effector neurons, and finally the behavioral response is elicited. the expression of or proteins is necessary and sufficient for odor detection in insects  <cit> . at first, volatile odors are bound to odorant-binding proteins , a family that includes two sub-families, the pheromone-binding proteins  and the general odorant-binding proteins   <cit> . other important soluble secreted proteins that are found within the sensillum lymph include chemosensory proteins  and the antennal binding protein x   <cit> . finally, odorant molecules bind with ors located in the dendritic membrane of receptor neurons  <cit> . sensory neuron membrane proteins  are another class of proteins involved in pheromone reception at the olfactory receptor neuron  . later, the signal termination is accomplished by the odorant-degrading enzymes   <cit> . knowledge of the olfactory communication system at the molecular level in insects is still in its early stages.

the tropical warehouse moth , ephestia cautella  is a destructive polyphagous storage pest of wheat flour, dried figs, dates, nuts, chocolate, dried fruits, grain and associated processed food products worldwide. the control of these pests has depended exclusively on methyl bromide; however, methyl bromide was reported as facing an international phase-out by the year  <dig>  <cit> . in this context, pheromones hold great potential in insect pest management  <cit> . in the last few decades, the elucidation of pheromone biosynthetic pathways, and the molecular characterization and functional gene expression of pheromone biosynthesis enzymes  and or proteins increased greatly  <cit> . most recently, through a synthetic biology approach, transgenic nicotiana benthamiana plants with insect desaturases, fars and fats produced pure multi-component pheromone compounds  <cit> . such in vitro production technology  could be cost effective and produce isomerically pure compounds that should be identical to chemically synthesized compounds. this research requires complete knowledge of the specific pheromone biosynthetic pathway and the functional characterization of enzymes  involved in pheromone biosynthesis.

the rapid progress over the last decade resulted from the convergence of modern techniques from different areas of science has enriched our knowledge of the genetics of pheromone-based communications and olfactory communication systems. transcriptome sequencing strategies are efficient for identifying a large number of expressed genes in specific tissues; thereby, providing information on the physiological, as well as molecular, properties of the tissue. over the last few years, next-generation sequencing  techniques have provided easy and effective methods for the discovery of novel genes. these approaches are particularly relevant when no genomic data are available for the target species  <cit> . over the past  <dig> years, rna sequencing data on the insect pheromone gland amassed rapidly . in the present study, using the illumina sequencing approach, we constructed the transcriptome dataset of the pg of e. cautella and identified genes with putative roles in pheromone biosynthesis, transport and degradation. we combined the transcriptomic datasets with the e. cautella female sex pheromone precursors characterized through gc-ms studies, identified specifically or highly abundantly expressed genes in the pg and proposed roles for them in pheromone biosynthesis, binding, transport and release.

RESULTS
sex pg extraction and fatty-acyl precursor analysis
analysis of the e. cautella pgs excised at the calling period  showed the presence of the compound - <dig> -tetradecadienyl acetate  by their gc retention times  and mass spectra  in comparison with those of authentic pheromone samples . our results were consistent with the earlier reports of the e. cautella female sex pheromone  <cit> . many studies have reported geographical variations and host-induced changes in the sex pheromone compounds and pheromone blend ratios in moths  <cit> . we isolated e. cautella  sex pheromones to identify such differences. date palm  has been cultivated in middle eastern countries since ancient times, and e. cautella is native to saudi arabia where it infests dried date fruits in storage houses. to determine sex pheromone differences in the native moth strain, we studied its pheromone biosynthetic pathway as follows.fig.  <dig> pheromone compound analysis of pg extract from e. cautella by gc-ms



fatty acid methyl esters  were made from the total lipid extract of e. cautella pg to determine the corresponding fatty acid precursors of z <dig> e12-14:oac. the pg extracts contained unsaturated and saturated fames, such as methyl hexadecanoate , 14:coome, 15:coome; z9-16:coome; e9-16:coome; z11-16:coome; e11-16:coome; 17:coome; 18:coome; z9-18:coome and z <dig> z12-18:coome. the fames were identified on the basis of their retention times relative to those of the authentic standards, as well as on their mass spectra . the gc-ms analysis of a methanolyzed gland lipid extracts showed the corresponding precursors, c16:acid, c14:acid, e14-16:acid, e12-14:acid and z <dig> e12-14:acid . the mono- and di-unsaturated precursor gc retention times and mass spectra matched those of the authentic standard samples . when comparing the relative proportions of the derived acids, e12-14:acid appeared to be more abundant. there were also large amounts of other fames identified as those of e9-16:coome and z9-16:coome, as well as small amounts of others tentatively assigned as e11-16:coome and z11-16:coome  .fig.  <dig> fatty acid analysis of pg extracts from e. cautella by gc-ms. the fatty acids methyl ester  were identified based on the retention time  of the authentic standard compound and mass spectra analysis



based on the identified pheromone precursors, the putative sex pheromone biosynthetic pathway of e. cautella was predicted as shown in fig.  <dig>  in e. cautella five major pheromone precursors, c14:acid, c16:acid, e14-16:acid; e12-14:acid and z <dig> e12-14:acid, were identified using the fame analysis of the pg. thus, it is rational to propose a pheromone biosynthetic pathway in which the saturated fatty acid precursor of the e. cautella sex pheromones is palmitic acid  that is desaturated by Δ14-desaturase to form the pheromone precursor e14-16:acyl-coa, which in turn has its chain shortened by β-oxidation to e12-14:acyl-coa. a unique Δ9-desaturase uses the e12-14:acyl-coa to produce z <dig> e12-14:acyl-coa that is reduced and acetylated to form z <dig> e12-14:oac, the final pheromone compound . an alternative pathway can also be proposed that involves the chain shortening of c16:acyl-coa to c14:acyl-coa, which is later desaturated by Δ12-desaturase to produce e12-14:acyl-coa, and then a unique Δ9-desaturase uses the e12-14:acyl-coa to produce z <dig> e12-14:acyl-coa . this is reduced and acetylated to form z <dig> e12-14:oac, the final pheromone compound of e. cautella. based on the fame analysis, the first pathway appears more fitting; however, further studies using in vivo labelling are required to test the hypothesis. we compared the e. cautella pheromone biosynthetic pathway with two spodoptera spp., s. exigua and s. littoralis, that use z <dig> e12-14:oac as a sex pheromone compound . in the present study, we isolated the sex pheromone, z <dig> e12-14:oac from e. cautella infesting dried date fruit and identified a major pheromone precursor e12-14:acid. hence, the proposed pheromone biosynthetic pathway  appears to be more appropriate. the common biosynthetic pathway leading to the production of a moth sex pheromone compound, based on the activity of a desaturase with a strict regio- and stereo-selectivity, produced different pheromone precursors, which are characteristic of different species  .fig.  <dig> proposed pheromone biosynthetic pathway leading to the sex pheromone of e. cautella, - <dig> -tetradecadienyl acetate



illumina sequencing and de novo assembly
illumina sequencing of a cdna library prepared from mrna of the e. cautella pg produced  <dig> , <dig> raw reads with an average length of  <dig> base pairs . after trimming adaptor sequences and eliminating low quality reads, there were  <dig> , <dig> reads  with an average length of 100 bp . the raw reads were deposited in the national center for biotechnology information  sequence read archive  database with the accession number srx <dig>  after assembly, with scaffolding,  <dig>  transcripts with an average length of 590 bp were obtained, having a maximum length of  <dig>  bp. most transcripts had lengths that ranged from  <dig> to 760 bp. the whole transcriptome size was  <dig>  mb, and the n <dig> size was 760 bp, with  <dig>  sequences longer than 1 kb. this transcriptome shotgun assembly project has been deposited at ddbj/embl/genbank under the accession gbxh <dig>  in comparison with previously reported pg transcriptome/est data , this pooled assembly of e. cautella pg sequences has the second greatest data volume and sequence lengths .

functional annotation
the assembled transcripts were used as query in a blastx against the non-redundant  ncbi protein database, uniprotkb, flybase and kegg, all with an e-value cut-off of 10e −  <dig>  most of the sequences had an e-value between  <dig> e −  <dig> and  <dig> e −  <dig> . the similarity between e. cautella pg sequences and those of the databases ranged from 36 % to ~100 %  with a peak at 65 %  . a blast2go analysis of the  <dig>  transcripts of the e. cautella pg resulted in  <dig>  transcripts with blast hits,  <dig>  without blast hits,  <dig>  with mapping results and  <dig>  annotated sequences . the sequences without blast hits may have low similarities to functionally similar genes in the database, novel genes or parts of the 5′ or 3′ utr regions. the pg transcript of e. cautella produced the most significant hits to b. mori sequences, followed by danaus plexippus sequences . the evidence code distribution for the blast hit chart indicates an over-representation of inferred electronic annotation , followed by inferred by mutant phenotype  and inferred by direct assays  . the maximum evidence code for the individual sequences was through iea, imp and lastly ida . the majority of functional predictions from the coding sequences were obtained from uniprotkb followed by flybase   .

go terms were assigned by blast2go through a search of the nr database, and interpro was searched using interproscan, resulting in ~ <dig>  transcripts from interpro and  <dig>  transcripts ‘without interpro’ that had go-annotation average lengths of 590 bp. using this method,  <dig>  unigenes were assigned to one or more go terms. annex was run after blast, and interproscan results were annotated with the following results:  <dig>  total original annotations,  <dig>  new annotations,  <dig>  original annotations replaced by new annotations due to specificity, and  <dig>  confirmed annotations.

as shown in table  <dig>   <dig>  genes, 35 % of all transcripts in nr,  <dig>  genes in uniprotkb, and  <dig>  enzymes encoded in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  returned cut-off blast hits >  <dig> e −  <dig>  a kegg metabolic pathway analysis revealed  <dig>  transcripts could be assigned to generate  <dig> predicted pathways . the major enzyme commission  classes included oxidoreductases , transferases , hydrolases , lyases , isomerases  and ligases . the kegg pathway map revealed the presence of a large number of pg transcripts involved in fatty acid biosynthesis , fatty acid elongation , fatty acid degradation  and most importantly, the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids  and genes  that may participate in pheromone biosynthesis . in total,  <dig> transcripts encoding five enzymes, des, fars, fats, acyl-coa oxidases and dehydrogenases, were assigned functional annotations .table  <dig> annotation of a pooled assembly, representing the e. cautella pg transcriptome

comparative analysis of pg transcripts in lepidoptera
by comparing e. cautella pg transcripts with those of b. mori and h. virescens from the ncbi database of differentially expressed transcripts and a. ipsilon from the sra database, a large number of pg transcriptome sequences were found to be homologous. after assembly, we obtained  <dig>  unigenes from a. ipsilon and  <dig>  and  <dig>  ests from b. mori and h. virescens, respectively.

we selected the first  <dig> bidirectional hits for each transcript from e. cautella, a. ipsilon, h. virescens and b. mori  for the comparative analysis. when comparing the pg transcripts pairwise using the bidirectional blast hit results, we found that between e. cautella and the three other lepidoptera, 45 % of the blast hits were shared, and 65 % of the blast hits were unique to e. cautella . the comparison between e. cautella and a. ipsilon showed that 20 % of the blast hits were shared, and 65 % of the blast hits were unique to e. cautella . similarly, a comparative analysis of blast hits of e. cautella, a. ipsilon and b. mori showed that  <dig>  % of the blast results were shared. comparative blast hits of e. cautella, a. ipsilon and h. virescens showed that  <dig>  % had homologous hits, while between e. cautella and h. virescens there was  <dig>  %, and between e. cautella and b. mori there was  <dig>  % shared blast hits . a large portion of the e. cautella transcripts  had no homologous hits in the available pg transcriptomes/ests of the other three species. this may have been because of the larger data set  for e. cautella and the lower coverage in the other studies . the high number of e. cautella blast hit results, which did not match a. ipsilon, b. mori or h. virescens may be due to novel genes with unique functions or highly conserved genes.fig.  <dig> venn diagram showing the comparative analysis of the e. cautella pg transcriptome with those of a. ipsilon, b. mori and h. virescens




identification of candidate genes involved in pheromone biosynthesis
in the present study, the e. cautella pheromone compound identified was z <dig> e12-14:oac, and the pheromone biosynthetic pathway is likely to be similar to those in other pyralid moths , which include fatty acid synthesis , including the actions of desaturases and β-oxidation enzymes, followed by modifications of the carboxyl group by reductases and acetyltransferases  <cit> . using blastx searches, we identified members of gene subfamilies in the e. cautella pg transcriptome putatively involved in z <dig> e12-14:oac pheromone production . these include two pban receptor isoforms, five fatty acid transport proteins , six accs,  <dig> fass,  <dig> dess,  <dig> fars,  <dig> fats and  <dig> ars . additionally,  <dig> transcripts encoding putative β-oxidation enzymes, including  <dig> acyl-coa dehydrogenases,  <dig> acyl-coa oxidases,  <dig> enoyl-coa hydratases, 17 l-3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenases, eight 3-ketoacyl-coa thiolases, three delta- <dig>  delta- <dig> trans-enoyl-coa isomerases and a delta-delta-dienoyl-coa isomerase, were identified . there were also  <dig> transcripts encoding putative pheromone degrading enzymes , three transcripts encoding putative abps,  <dig> transcripts encoding putative obps, seven candidate csps, two transcripts encoding pbps,  <dig> candidate ors, two candidate sensory neuron membrane proteins and three candidate ionotropic receptors  . their abundance levels, based on rpkm values, in the pg transcriptome are shown in table  <dig> table  <dig> putative pheromone biosynthesis enzymes  in the e. cautella pg

the pban receptor
previous studies concluded that the sex pheromone biosynthetic machinery of lepidopteran pg cells is regulated by pban, which is released from the brain, goes to the hemolymph and binds to the pban receptor in the membrane of pheromone producing cells, triggering pheromone production  <cit> . we found two transcripts, ep_contig_ <dig> and ep_contig_ <dig>  encoding proteins highly homologous to pban receptor isoforms c and a, respectively . they have very low abundance levels in the e. cautella transcriptome   but high identities  to the o. nubilalis pban receptors c and a in genbank   <cit> . the pban receptors functionally characterized from o. nubilalis  <cit>  and h. virescens  <cit>  include isoforms a and c, and in the present study we identified pban isoforms a and c from e. cautella pg, which should be involved in pheromone production. the sequence identity  of e. cautella pban isoforms a and c indicate that they are likely produced by alternative splicing at the 3′-end of the receptor gene as reported in other moths, generating multiple receptor subtypes  <cit> . we also found a g-protein-coupled receptor  that shows homology  to the diapause hormone receptors of h. zea and b. mori . the diapause hormone receptor is a g-protein gamma-subunit homolog, which is hypothesized to interact with the pban receptor, and has been reported in the pg transcriptomes of a. segatum  <cit>  and h. virescens  <cit> .

fatty acid transport protein  
fatps belong to an evolutionarily conserved family of membrane-bound proteins that facilitate the uptake of extracellular long-chain fatty acids , and/or very lcfas, and catalyze the atp-dependent esterification of these fatty acids to their corresponding acyl-coa derivatives  <cit> . the important role of fatps in pheromonogenesis has been demonstrated in b. mori  <cit>  and in o. scapulalis  <cit> . in e. cautella, we found five fatp isoforms in unigene_ <dig>  with high transcript abundance levels and a high identity  to those of o. scapulalis  .

acetyl coa carboxylase  
pheromone biosynthesis begins with an acc catalyzing the production of malonyl-coa from acetyl-coa in the first committed biosynthesis step  <cit> . in the e. cautella pg we found six transcripts encoding accs. acc partial sequence ep_unigene_ <dig>   <dig> and ep_contig_ <dig> showed more than 90 % identity with a. ipsilon acc . ep_unigene_3_acc showed 93 % similarity with b. mori acc  . based on their rpkm values , ep_unigene_ <dig>   <dig> and ep_contig_ <dig> were relatively highly expressed in the e. cautella pg .

fatty acid synthase  
in moth pheromone biosynthesis, fas is supposed to catalyze the conversion of malonyl-coa and nadph to produce saturated fatty acids   <cit> . we found  <dig> fas-like partial transcripts in the e. cautella pg, which produced five different blastx hits in ncbi. thus, we are proposing the existence of five fas-like genes in e. cautella . partial sequences of ep_contig_ <dig> and  <dig> showed high similarity levels  to a. ipsilon fas , whereas ep_contig_ <dig> showed a high similarity to d. plexippus fas . the details of other fas transcripts and blastx hit similarities are given in table  <dig>  based on the rpkm value , ep_contig_ <dig> was highly expressed in the e. cautella pg .

desaturases  
the desaturases introduce a double bond into the fatty acyl carbon chain, with strict regio- and stereo-selectivity. the desaturases characterized thus far include enzymes that act on saturated and monounsaturated substrates, which include Δ <dig>  <cit> , ∆ <dig>  <cit> , Δ <dig> , Δ <dig>  <cit> , Δ <dig>  <cit>  and Δ <dig>  <cit> . desaturases are characterized by having three histidine boxes containing eight histidine residues, which are used for binding essential metal complexes used in the enzyme reaction, and acyl-coa desaturases introduce unsaturated bonds into fatty acids that are bound to coa  <cit> .

in e. cautella, four major pheromone precursors, c14:acid; e14-16:acid; e12-14:acid and z <dig> e12-14:acid, were identified using a fame analysis of the pg. in the e. cautella sex pheromones’ biosynthesis, a two-step desaturation process is proposed, involving ∆ <dig>  or ∆ <dig>  and ∆ <dig> desaturases . in the e. cautella pg transcriptome,  <dig> transcripts encoding desaturases have been identified . ep_unigene_ <dig> and ep_contig_ <dig> are the highly expressed desaturases in the e. cautella pg , followed by ep_unigene_ <dig>  and ep_contigs_ <dig> and  <dig>  . contigs_ <dig> and  <dig> are closely related to the ctenopseustis obliquana desaturase , which has ∆ <dig>  ∆ <dig> and ∆ <dig> fatty acid desaturase activities  <cit> . ep_unigene_9_ <dig> and ep_contig_ <dig> showed high similarities to amyelois transitella  and o. furnacalis z/e <dig> desaturases , respectively, which have ∆ <dig> and ∆ <dig> desaturase activities  <cit> . ep_contig_ <dig> and contig_ <dig> may have ∆ <dig> and ∆ <dig> desaturase activities  and could be involved in the formation of e14-16:acyl-coa and z <dig> e12-14:acyl-coa, and ep_unigene_9_ <dig>  or ep_contig_ <dig>  may have ∆ <dig> desaturase activity and could be involved in z <dig> e12-14:acyl-coa synthesis from e12-14:acyl-coa or multifunctional ∆ <dig> and ∆ <dig> desaturase activities . further studies on the functional gene expression levels of these desaturases in a transformed yeast  expression system are in progress.

the phylogenetic analysis of e. cautella desaturases with other moth desaturases is shown in the fig.  <dig>  based on the phylogenetic tree, three possible candidate desaturases have been identified, ep_contig_349/ep_unigene_ <dig>  ep_unigene_9/ep_contig_ <dig> and ep_contig_70932/ep_contig_ <dig>  which form a clade with ∆ <dig>  ∆ <dig>  ∆ <dig> and ∆ <dig> desaturases . ep_contig_349/ep_unigene_ <dig> is closely related to o. nubilalis and o. furnacalis ∆ <dig> and ∆ <dig> desaturases . ep_unigene_9/ep_contig_ <dig> is in the clade with spodoptera littoralis desaturases, which have z <dig> and e <dig>  desaturase activities . the third putative desaturase type includes ep_contig_ <dig> and ep_contig_ <dig> and is closely related to the ∆ <dig> desaturases of o. furnacalis and o. nubilalis  . the one and only ∆ <dig> desaturase reported so far is from a pyraloidea moth, o. furnacalis  <cit> , although a later study showed several cryptic ∆11- and ∆14-desaturase genes exist in the o. nubilalis genome  <cit> . further studies on the functional expression of desaturases in e. cautella will provide more insights into the origin and evolution of the ∆ <dig> desaturases.fig.  <dig> phylogeny of lepidopteran desaturase genes



β-oxidation enzymes
once the ∆ <dig> desaturase introduces a double bond in palmitate it forms e14-16:acid , which is later subjected to chain shortening by β-oxidation, resulting in the fatty acyl pheromone precursor, e12-14:acid . in the alternative pathway, it is involved in the 16:acyl chain being shortened to 14:acyl by β-oxidation. β-oxidation is the action of a series of enzymes, working sequentially and forming a reaction spiral  <cit> .

first, by the action of acyl coa oxidase   and acyl-coa dehydrogenase  , acyl-coa is converted into e2-enoyl-coa. there was an earlier report of four different acds, short-chain, medium-chain, long-chain and very-long-chain acds, depending on the fatty acyl chain-length specificities  <cit> . however, there is no report characterizing the acds involved in moth pheromone biosynthesis. it is possible that medium-chain acds could be more active because they act on hexanoyl-coa, whereas long-chain acds preferentially act on octanoyl-coa and longer chain-length substrates. we found many candidate genes of acds and acyl-coa oxidases in the pg of e. cautella. in particular, ep_unigene_3_acd  and ep_unigene_2_acd are the most abundant acds , and ep_unigene_1_aco  and ep_unigene_6_aco are the most abundant acyl-coa oxidases in the pg  . moreover, we found two unigenes  of isovaleryl coenzyme a dehydrogenase, which is specific to the metabolism of branched-chain fatty acids  <cit>  .

the next step of β-oxidation involves e2-enoyl-coa, which is reversibly hydrated by enoyl-coa hydratase to l-3-hydroxylacyl-coa. two kinds of enoyl-coa hydratases have been identified in mitochondria, one specialized for crotonyl-coa  and the other one being a long-chain enoyl-coa hydratase, which effectively hydrates medium and long-chain substrates  <cit> . we found many candidate genes for enoyl-coa hydratases and, among these, the ep_unigene_4_ech  is the most abundantly expressed in the pg of e. cautella . it shows a 93 % amino acid identity with the pg of papilio xuthus  .

the third reaction involves a reversible dehydrogenation of l-3-hydroxyacyl-coa to 3-ketoacyl-coa catalyzed by l-3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase. there are three different kinds of l-3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenases that have been reported in mitochondria, long-chain, medium-chain and short-chain l-3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase   <cit> . in the e. cautella pg, we found many candidate genes for long-, medium- and short-chain l-3-hydroxyacyl-coa- dehydrogenases. ep_unigene_4_hcd  is highly abundant in the pg , followed by ep-unigene_2_hcd , and they both show high amino acid identities with d. plexippus and b. mori hydroxyacyl-coa-dehydrogenases  .

finally, 3-ketoacyl-coa is cleaved by a thiolase between its α- and β-carbon atoms, producing the two carbon shorter substrate . three kinds of thiolases exist in mitochondria, acetoacetyl-coa thiolase or acetyl-coa acetyltransferase , 3-ketoacyl-coa thiolase or acetyl-coa acyl transferase , and long chain 3-ketoacyl-coa thiolase , where the first two kinds of thiolases are components of the soluble matrix enzyme complex  <cit> . we found eight candidate thiolase genes in the pg of e. cautella, with ep_contig_2704_kct  having the most highly abundant transcript in the pg   and a 94 % amino acid identity with d. plexippus  .

the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids requires auxiliary enzymes, such as delta- <dig>  delta- <dig> trans-enoyl-coa isomerase and  <dig> -dienoyl-coa reductase, to modify the structure of the double bond during the β-oxidation process  <cit> . in the e. cautella pg, we found four delta- <dig>  delta- <dig> trans-enoyl-coa isomerases, two mitochondrial and two peroxisomal, and among these ep_unigene_1_teci  has the most abundant transcripts  . additionally, we found a delta-delta-dienoyl-coa isomerase , which is specialized for processing odd-numbered double bonds  <cit>  .

moth pheromones generally consist of 10c-16c compounds synthesized from c16-c <dig> fatty acid moieties, involving many chain-shortening reactions  <cit> . previous research has mostly been related to the desaturases and functional group modification enzymes, while research on the chain-shortening enzymes involved in pheromone biosynthesis has been meager. in the present study, we found many promising candidates that may be involved in β-oxidation, and further research on their heterologous expression, or rnai, could reveal their significance in e. cautella pheromone biosynthesis.

fatty acyl reductase  
far enzymes catalyze the reduction of fatty acyl precursors to fatty alcohols in a reaction that is dependent upon nadph as a cofactor . far genes have been shown to function in pheromone biosynthesis in moth species directly through the production of an alcohol that confers species specificity or indirectly through the biosynthesis of precursor compounds  <cit> . the number of far genes per genome can vary greatly between organisms. in vertebrates, there are two reductase genes present in the genomes, whereas there are more than a dozen present in the moth o. scapulalis  <cit> . the far gene family undergoes birth- and death-related evolution  <cit> . even though the evolutionary origins of this gene family are not well understood, it has been assumed, based on protein sequence similarity, that the acyl-coa synthetase, acyltransferase and oxidoreductase gene families are close relatives of this family, and thus form a superfamily  <cit> . in the e. cautella pg transcriptome pooled data, we identified  <dig> far-like genes, which included partial and full-length sequences , and blastx results identified them as putative far-like genes . based on the sequence assembly, multiple sequence alignment and blastx hit results, we named them uniquely; however, they may represent partial sequences of the same fars. we took care to avoid duplications; however, if the full-length sequence was not available in our transcriptome dataset or in the ncbi database, then it could be present in partial sequences. ep_unigene _ <dig>  is the most highly expressed far in e. cautella’s pg . it showed a  <dig>  % identity with d. plexippus , followed by ep_unigene _ <dig>  and ep_unigene _ <dig> . it shares a  <dig>  % amino acid identity with o. nubilalis and a  <dig>  % with d. plexippus . all other fars, except two, ep_unigene_ <dig> and ep_unigene_ <dig> , have a low abundance, with rpkm values of less than  <dig>  in the pg transcriptome . further studies on the tissue specificity of each far to determine the pg-specific fars is in progress.

the phylogenetic analysis of moth fars is shown in fig.  <dig>  based on the phylogenetic tree, three possible candidate fars were identified, ep_contig_ <dig>  ep_contig_ <dig> and ep_contig_ <dig>  which formed a clade with moth pgfar . until now pgfar had been characterized from b. mori  <cit> , o. scapulalis  <cit> , nine ostrinia spp.  <cit> , three yponomeuta spp.  <cit> , as well as helicoverpa and heliothis  <cit> . in the e. cautella pg, ep_contig_ <dig> and ep_contig_ <dig> fars formed a cluster with the ostrinia pgfars , and ep_contig_ <dig> formed a cluster with the yponomeuta, helicoverpa and heliothis pgfar clade . further studies on tissue-specific expression and heterologous gene expression in a yeast system are in progress.fig.  <dig> phylogeny of lepidopteran fatty acyl reductase  genes

aldehyde reductase  
ars are members of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily and can reduce long-chain acyl-coa to form aldehyde intermediates  <cit> . in insects that use both an alcohol and an aldehyde as part of their pheromone, it is unclear how the production of both components occurs. even though we did not identify any aldehyde precursors in the pg of e. cautella during the fame analysis, we are still discussing ars in this study because ars and fars share an evolutionary history, and the gene families are closely related  <cit> . in the e. cautella pg we identified  <dig> transcripts with homology to the aldo-keto reductases of a. ipsilon, papilio xanthus, b. mori, chilo suppressalis and d. plexippus . the derived protein sequences of these  <dig> transcripts showed a 68–82 % amino acid identity with their homologs in other insects. all of the ar transcripts were present at a low abundance  in the pg transcriptome ; therefore, we assumed that ar does not have a role in e. cautella pheromone biosynthesis.

fatty acetyltransferases  
to produce the acetate ester pheromone components, most moths use an acetyl-coa: fatty alcohol acetyltransferase that converts fatty alcohols to acetate esters . the genes involved in this step have not been characterized from any insects . however, different acetyltransferases, which have a characteristic motif  and a conserved region , have been cloned from plants  <cit> . in the e .cautella pg transcriptome,  <dig> fat-like genes were identified, showing homology to d. plexippus, b. mori, o. scapulalis and a. ipsilon . except for two fats, they showed a greater than 70 % amino acid identity, the highest being ep_contig_ <dig> at 95 %, with a. ipsilon . we searched the conserved domains  within the protein or coding nucleotide sequence databases at ncbi, but none of the e. cautella pg acetyltransferases belonged to the plant category fats, suggesting that e. cautella may not express this gene family or that they have undergone substantial evolutionary changes. nevertheless, most of the e. cautella fats had hits to members of the n-acyltransferase  superfamily with cd accession no. cl <dig> . the cd accession nos. of e. cautella pg acetyltransferases are given in the table  <dig> . all fat transcripts were present at low abundance levels  in the e. cautella pg transcriptome ; therefore, we could not predict which, if any, had roles in pheromone biosynthesis. however, phylogenetic analysis showed that ep_unigene_ <dig> and ep_unigene_ <dig> clustered with yeast  alcohol acetyltransferase  , which catalyzes the esterification of isoamyl alcohol by acetyl coenzyme a . there are several candidate e. cautella fat transcripts  that did not form a clade with any other fat transcripts of the a. ipsilon or s. inferens transcriptome datasets .

candidate pheromone degrading enzymes in the e. cautella pg
pheromone molecules would be potentially harmful to insects if they remained on the ors after they had stimulated the orns. many studies emphasize that there are mechanisms to protect the orns using odes  <cit> , including esterases , aldehyde oxidases , cytochrome p <dig> , carboxyl esterases   <cit>  and glutathione s-transferase   <cit> , which occur in major chemosensory tissues, including the terminal abdominal segment  <cit> . in general, the esterase gene family consists of three major groups: intracellular , neuro/developmental  and secreted esterases   <cit> . the secreted esterase class contains five major subclasses  esterases, jhes-like enzymes, β-esterases and semiochemical esterases), and the odes are members of the semiochemical esterases, which are potentially involved in the degradation of pheromone compounds and plant volatiles  <cit> . the secreted esterase are of three different types, antennal enriched , both antennal and pg-enriched  and esterases expressed throughout the body   <cit> .

in the present study, we identified  <dig> transcripts predicted to encode esterases in the e. cautella pg, and the blastx results showed that they shared very high amino acid identities with the esterases of s. exigua, s. littoralis, b. mori and d. plexippus . by comparing e. cautella cxes with s. littoralis  <cit>  and s. inferens  <cit>  we identified the e. cautella cxes that are known to be both antennal and pg-enriched, including cxe  <dig>  cxe <dig>  cxe <dig>  cxe <dig>  cxe <dig> and cxe <dig> . all of the esterase transcripts were present at low abundance levels  in the pg transcriptome ; however, cxe <dig>  had the most highly expressed esterase transcript level  . durand et al.  <cit>  reported the ubiquitous expression of cxe <dig> in s. littoralis with a specific role in pheromone processing. homologous cxe13s also reported in antheraea polyphemus and popilia japonica were found to degrade the pheromone in vitro  <cit> . thus, we assumed that cxe <dig> has a specific role in e. cautella pheromone processing and degradation.fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood  tree of insect esterases 



to assign putative functions and correct identifications, an esterase phylogenetic tree was constructed using  <dig> e. cautella transcripts and other insect  esterases . the phylogeny showed that cxe <dig> , cxe <dig> , cxe <dig> , cxe <dig> , cxe <dig> , cxe <dig>  and cxe <dig>  clustered with the corresponding cxes of s. littoralis  <cit>  and s. inferens  <cit>  . the phylogeny also revealed that ep_contig_ <dig>  ep_contig_ <dig> and ep_contig_ <dig> clustered with the jh esterase of d. melanogaster , integumental esterase of a. polyphemus  and neuroligins of a. mellifera , respectively .

candidate pheromone carrier proteins in the e. cautella pg
in insects, the odorant binding proteins and the chemosensory proteins are involved in olfaction and contact chemosensation  <cit> . specific obps that are involved in pheromone binding and transport are called pbps  <cit> . in moths, obps are divided into three main classes based on sequence alignment and their localization in the insect body. pbps are preferentially expressed in pheromone-sensitive sensilla trichodea from male antennae, gobps are mainly found in the female antennae, in particular in the plant odor sensitive sensilla basiconica  and abpxs represent the third class  <cit> . based on the sensillar distribution, pbps may be involved in pheromone binding, gobps in binding the plant volatiles and abpxs in binding general odorants. the functions of obps are to solubilize the hydrophobic odorant molecules in the aqueous lymph surrounding the dendrites and to protect them from the ‘degrading esterases’ circulating in the lymph  <cit> . additionally, the obps deliver the odorant stimuli molecules to specific ors by releasing the odorant upon contact with membrane structures  <cit> .

although csps are expressed all over the insect’s body, they exist mainly in the legs and in contact chemosensory sensilla. csps consist of polypeptide chains of about  <dig> amino acids with a molecular weight of 12–13 kda. obps have six highly conserved cysteines, whereas csps have only four cysteines  <cit> . several studies have shown that moth sex pheromones are protected against degradation until they are released from the female pg, and it has been proposed that obps and csps participate in this process  <cit> .

in the e. cautella pg, we identified transcripts of  <dig> csps and  <dig> obps , all containing the typical insect obp  <cit>  or csp sequence motifs  <cit> , respectively. one csp transcript, ep_unigene_4_csp, appears to be expressed at an extremely high level  in the pg and has a relatively high abundance of transcripts in the pg transcriptome . phylogenetic analysis shows ep_unigene_4_csp clustered with b. mori csp <dig>   <cit> , h. virescens csp  <cit>  and a. ipsilon csp <dig>   <cit>  . aipscsp <dig> shows a high expression level in the pg and has extremely abundant transcripts in the a. ipsilon pg  <cit> . previously, rnai studies suggested a novel role for a csp <dig> in the development of the embryonic integument in a. mellifera and were found to be highly expressed in the ovary  <cit> . all obps have very low expression levels in the pg, but ep_contig_6721_obp and ep_contig_8460_obp were comparatively highly expressed obp transcripts  . to assign putative identifications, an obp phylogenetic tree was constructed with e. cautella obp transcripts and the b. mori obps  <cit>  . the phylogeny identified e. cautella obps homologous to b. mori obp <dig> , obp <dig> , obp <dig> , obp <dig> , obp <dig> , obp <dig> , obp <dig> , obp <dig> , obp <dig> , obp <dig>  and obp <dig>  . a six-cysteine signature is the most typical feature of classical obps  <cit>  and e. cautella obps carry most of the conserved cysteine residues . the b. mori obps reported above were found to express in multiple tissues including the terminal abdominal segments   <cit> . further studies are needed to clarify the roles of the csps and obps in protecting against the degradation of the e. cautella pheromone prior to its release from the female pg.fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood  tree of the odorant binding proteins 



we found very low expression levels of three abp transcripts  and two pbp transcripts  in the e. cautella pg . widmayer et al.  <cit>  detected pbp <dig> in the h. virescens ovipositor tip, and we found a homologous sequence in the e. cautella pg  showing an  <dig>  % amino acid identity with a. transitella . in h. virescens, the response to the major pheromone component  is mediated by the pbp <dig> and the pheromone receptor hr <dig>  <cit> .

the expression of odorant receptor proteins has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for odor detection in insects  <cit> . widmayer et al.  <cit>  detected the pheromone receptors hr <dig>  hr <dig> and hr <dig> in the h. virescens ovipositor tip, and hr <dig> along with pbp <dig> mediated abdominal responses to the emitted pheromones. in the e. cautella pg, we identified  <dig> putative ors,  <dig> candidate irs and  <dig> candidate snmps . to assign putative identifications, an or phylogenetic tree was constructed using e. cautellaor transcripts, h. virescens hr <dig>  hr <dig> and hr <dig>  <cit>  and h. armigeraors  <cit>  . based on the phylogenetic analysis, ep_unigene_5_or  is closely related to the pheromone receptor of h. virescens h <dig>  <cit>  and or <dig> of h. armigera   <cit>  . recently, liu et al.,  <cit>  reported harmor <dig> responds to the h. armigera pheromone compound  using calcium imaging studies, and they also found significant gene expression levels in the terminal abdominal segments  of h. armigera. hence, we assume that in the e. cautella pg, the response to the pheromone component  is mediated by the pheromone binding protein, ecaupbp <dig> and the receptor type ecauor <dig>  and it may have an important role in the transport and release of the pheromone molecule. further studies on the functional characterization of ecaupbp <dig> and the receptor type ecauor <dig> will be necessary to prove the hypothesis. phylogenetic comparisons of e. cautellaors with those of h. armigera  <cit>  identified the e. cautella receptor proteins expressed in the terminal abdominal segment . all the receptor protein transcripts were present in very low abundance  in the pg . it is noteworthy that a snmp, ep_contig_ 1371_snmp, which has a greater than 70 % amino acid identity with an o. nubilalis snmp , was expressed highly in the tas  . further studies on these pg-expressed ors, snmps and irs involved in e. cautella pheromone binding and transport need to be performed.

CONCLUSIONS
the tropical warehouse moth, e. cautella, listed as a major storage pest, is a serious threat to the date and chocolate factories of the middle east and europe. our study provides comprehensive information on the pheromone molecules, biosynthetic pathways and genes expressed in the pg that are related to pheromone biosynthesis, degradation, transport and release. our study provides information on the e. cautella sex pheromone and precursors in the pg, and shows two possible pheromone biosynthetic pathways. both pathways initiate from c16:acyl-coa, and one involves ∆ <dig> and ∆ <dig> desaturation to generate z <dig> e12-14:acyl, while the other pathway involves the chain shortening of c16:acyl-coa to c14:acyl-coa, followed by ∆ <dig> and ∆ <dig> desaturation to generate z <dig> e12-14:acyl-coa. finally, reduction and acetylation generate z <dig> e12-14:oac. using the illumina sequencing of the pg transcriptome, we identified candidate genes: pban receptor isoforms a and c, fatps, accs, fass, dess, several β-oxidation enzymes, fars and fats. two transcripts, ep_unigene_9_1286/ep_contig_ <dig> and ep_contig_349/ep_contig_ <dig> are highly expressed, form a cluster with moth desaturases and might be involved in the ∆ <dig> or ∆ <dig> and ∆ <dig> desaturation processes. the highly expressed β-oxidation enzymes, dehydrogenases, oxidases, hydratases, thiolases, enoyl and dienoyl isomerases, which are involved in the chain shortening, have been identified. three possible candidate fars have also been identified, ep_contig_ <dig>  ep_contig_ <dig> and ep_contig_ <dig>  which form a cluster with moth pgfar, and thus, might be involved in the reduction step of z <dig> e12-14:acid to z <dig> e12-14: alcohol. two possible fats, ep_unigene_ <dig> and  <dig>  which clustered with yeast alcohol acetyltransferases, are good candidates for gene expression studies. we found many promising candidate pbes, and further research using heterologous gene expression or rnai could reveal the significance of these genes in e. cautella pheromone biosynthesis. several candidate esterases have also been identified, including cxe <dig> , which may be involved in signal inactivation by removing the pheromone molecules. the csp  is the most highly abundant transcript of the e. cautella pg, and, together with two obps  and one ecaupbp <dig> , it may have an important functional role in protecting sex pheromones from the activities of esterases, as well as in the transport and release of the pheromone molecules. the ors, ecauor <dig>  and ecaupbp <dig>  meditate abdominal responses to the emitted pheromone in e. cautella, and may have important roles in the transport and release of the pheromone molecules. our study provides strong background information on the enzymes involved in pheromone biosynthesis that will be useful for the in vitro production of e. cautella sex pheromones. the study also provides information on novel genes involved in the transport, release and degradation of pheromone compounds, increases the understanding of the sex pheromone detection system, and it may provide potential targets for disrupting the pheromone-based communication system in e. cautella for control purposes.
