BACKGROUND
one of the aims in systems biology is to reveal functions and uncover causalities in the behavior of biological systems. as these systems are usually a composition of multiple processes, mathematical modeling is often applied to investigate processes of interest. the understanding of the parts contributes to the understanding of the system as a whole. one biological process of interest is the regulation of gene expression which is mostly influenced by transcription factors . these regulating proteins can have an activating or repressing effect on the expression of a gene. the extend of regulation largely depends on the activity of the tf which is determined on multiple levels, mostly the post-translational level
 <cit> . therefore, the gene expression profile of a tf can generally not be considered as its activity profile. however, the target genes, their regulators  and the relations between these entities constitute a gene regulatory network  which gives information about the functions of the individual genes. this network is commonly represented as a graph where nodes correspond to the genes and edges are the regulatory relations between them.

to reconstruct grns, gene expression data-based network inference is a widely accepted approach. although high-throughput technologies such as microarrays and rna-seq have become more accessible  there are still central problems that hamper their inference. a major difficulty is that the number of available measurements is usually lower than required. often, more genes than the number of available measurements are included in the model. this leads to an underdetermined system with a large amount of possible solutions. when dealing with time series data, a low temporal resolution of measurements contributes to this problem making it more difficult to obtain a reliable solution. additionally, the usually low number of replicates does not account for the variability introduced by the methods of measurement and the natural biological variation. hecker et al. <cit>  highlighted the relationship between the complexity of the model, the data required to explain the observed behavior and the quality of the inference result. different algorithms have been proposed that cope with the aforementioned problems in various ways. for reviews on the different approaches see
 <cit> . depending on the purpose of the model, we can distinguish these approaches by splitting them into two groups, algorithms that produce models that are able to quantitatively describe the dynamic behavior of the network, and algorithms which do not. algorithms that belong to the first group are usually based on difference or differential equations. although these models offer advantages such as the simulation of the dynamics and the modeling of complex relations between the components of a network, there are also drawbacks like an increased computational effort for network structure and parameter optimization. as a consequence, the number of genes that can be modeled is limited. therefore, pre-selection of genes is required which supposes a vast prior-knowledge about the relevant genes and processes. one of the freely accessible, ready-to-use algorithms that falls into this category is the successfully applied
 <cit>  netgenerator algorithm
 <cit> .

depending on whether or not the utilized model is based on linear or non-linear differential equations the number of free parameters and therefore the detail of the model, but also the complexity of the inference problem is increasing drastically
 <cit> . there is always a trade off between the simplification of the real biological system under observation and the loss of important mechanisms of regulation
 <cit> . the high degree of detail enables non-linear models to represent the dynamic behavior of biological and biochemical systems in an adequate manner. due to the high number of free parameters however, these models are often used under presumptions such as the availability of large amounts of data
 <cit> , a known network structure, constrains regarding the network structure
 <cit> , or additional kinetic knowledge
 <cit>  or assumptions . a lack of these presumptions may force modelers to choose linear over non-linear models to minimize the number of parameters to estimate and reduce the search space. however, despite the loss of detail linear models have been shown to successfully represent regulatory networks that are able to effectively uncover causal relations between the entities of biological processes such as in
 <cit> .

in the second group of algorithms, there is a trade-off between the flexibility and possibility for quantitative, dynamic modeling and the advantage of processing larger network sizes. there are regression-based algorithms such as lasso
 <cit> , least angle regression 
 <cit>  or transcription factor binding site integrating lars 
 <cit> , correlation-based algorithms
 <cit>  and information theory-based algorithms such as the algorithm for the reverse engineering of accurate cellular networks 
 <cit> , mrnet
 <cit>  or context likelihood of relatedness 
 <cit> , which are able to infer large networks. regression based algorithms were successfully used to infer full genomic networks
 <cit> . these algorithms use simple models and are known to be fast. some of the methods were also shown to construct networks that tend to fulfill structural properties such as scale-freeness
 <cit> , which has been observed in real, existing biological networks
 <cit> . furthermore, the aracne algorithm was extended to the time-delay aracne 
 <cit>  algorithm, which is able to consider temporal information.

in the following, we present an algorithm which combines the advantages of both of these classes, fast inference of medium size networks that can quantitatively model the dynamic behavior of the inferred network. we extend the existing tilar algorithm that uses a linear network model based on the lars algorithm. networks inferred with tilar consist of two types of nodes, the genes with measured expression profile to model and the regulating tfs, that connect these genes. due to this concept of modeling, the algorithm makes use of various biological knowledge sources such as transcription factor binding site  information and gene interaction knowledge. this information decreases the number of possible network structures and therefore, allows fast inference of reliable, biologically meaningful networks. while the tfbs knowledge is represented by the network edges that go from a regulating tf to a target gene , the gene interaction knowledge is represented by the edges that connect the target genes with the regulating tfs .

extended tilar  adapts this modeling concept to produce network models that are based on linear ordinary differential equations. this allows the inference of networks from time series data, which can be used to uncover the most important unknown relations between genes and to identify potential key regulators. linear models represent approximations close to a steady state  of non-linear models that are adequate for living systems in principle. non-linear terms can and should be included in the proposed modeling algorithm if prior knowledge about the type of non-linearity is available and if the number of experimental data is sufficient to identify the increased number of model parameters. however, the automatic identification of additional non-linear model terms in general requires more independent experimental data in order to ensure a stable convergence of the algorithm to a unique model structure . extilar makes use of all replicate-measurements at once, which produces stable networks that are robust to small variations in the data. to assess the performance of extilar, the algorithm was applied to in silico data. the results were compared to those obtained by the published network inference tool netgenerator
 <cit> .

extilar was applied to data from zellmer et al. <cit>  which monitors the response of murine primary hepatocytes to the exchange of culture medium after a period of starvation. we investigated a set of differentially expressed genes for which the corresponding proteins are known to exhibit transcription factor activity . for some of these detfs, little about their function in hepatocytes or liver in general was found in literature. by inferring a transcription factor network   with extilar using the extracted detfs, we study their potential roles in the cellular response and identify new causal relations. subsequently, processing of the data and knowledge extraction will be described. consecutively, the modeling concept of tilar will be outlined, followed by the introduction of extilar and a detailed description of its modified modeling concept. finally, the results of the inference will be presented and analyzed. for validation, a knock-down experiment was performed which confirmed the predicted relation between the tfs tgif <dig> and atf <dig>  and dbp and atf <dig> 

RESULTS
inference from biological data
data of primary murine hepatocytes from zellmer et al. <cit>  were used to investigate the cellular response to the change of culture medium after a period of starvation . originally, a time series experiment  with  <dig> biological replicates at the first time point and  <dig> biological replicates at the remaining time points was performed using  <dig> affymetrix moe <dig> microarrays. for this study, we investigated only the second phase of the experiment . therefore, the time points will be subsequently referred to as  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours after the change of culture medium. the workflow consists of  <dig> steps , data pre-processing, identification of differentially expressed genes, clustering and extraction of detfs , extraction of regulatory relations between tfs and the detfs , extraction of prior-knowledge for the detfs and the tfs , the network inference, the interpretation and analysis of the inferred tfn and finally, experimental validation of the extracted hypotheses.

pre-processing and gene filtering
the latest custom chip definition file from brainarray
 <cit>   based on entrez gene id’s was used to annotate the microarrays. pre-processing was performed using the standard robust multi-array average 
 <cit>  procedure. detection calls
 <cit>  were calculated and used for filtering of probe sets . this resulted in  <dig> genes that were analyzed for differential expression using a 2-fold-change criterion. this resulted in  <dig> identified differentially expressed genes  . the enrichment analysis using gostats
 <cit>  showed that the degs are associated with various metabolic processes such as organic acid metabolism, steroid and lipid metabolic processes .

clustering
to identify groups of similarly regulated genes, the degs were clustered according to their expression profile using the self-organizing tree algorithm 
 <cit> . this resulted in six clusters denoted as up, slow-up, fast-down, down, slow-down and middle-peak-down . gostats was used to perform an enrichment analysis for each cluster . the results show an increasing tendency over time in the expression profile of genes associated with oxidation-reduction processes and glutathione metabolic processes , translation activity and the ribosome . genes associated with other metabolic processes such as the fructose, glucose, lipid and steroid metabolic process  decreased in their expression level over time.
 <dig> 

extraction of detfs
a total of  <dig> detfs were extracted by filtering all degs associated with the go-category “sequence-specific dna binding transcription factor activity” . according to the gene ontology  terms obtained from the mgi database
 <cit> , it was found that almost all extracted detfs can be connected to either metabolic processes or differentiation/cell faith processes .

detf cluster membership and associated biological functions based on the information of geneontology. for all but gatad <dig> and klf <dig> it was found that the tfs can either be associated with metabolic processes and/or cell faith.

extraction of prior-knowledge
opossum was used to identify possible regulators for each cluster
 <cit> . therefore, the promoter region from the transcription start site to 2000bp upstream was used to find over-represented tfbss using the binding site information from the jaspar database
 <cit> . this resulted in a total of  <dig> tfs for the six clusters.

transfac
 <cit>  and pathway studio  <dig> 
 <cit>  were used to identify regulating tfs that are known to have an influence on the expression of the extracted detfs of the data set . while transfac contains experimentally validated tfbs for most of the identified tfs, pathway studio was applied to extend the list of potential regulators using literature knowledge derived by text-mining. this way,  <dig> tf-to-gene relations were extracted for  <dig> detfs. however, no tfbs information was retrieved for six detfs  using either of the two approaches. to make them available for the network inference process, an artificial tf was added for each of them. this is necessary as the modeling concept of tilar-based algorithms allows to model gene regulation exclusively via tfs and not directly between the genes. each detf should have at least one tf to act not only as the regulating source, but to be also available as a target of regulation. this resulted in a total of  <dig> tf-to-gene relations for the clusters as well as for the detfs. prior-knowledge was obtained using pathway studio  <dig>   <dig> gene-to-tf relations were extracted where a detf was identified to modulate the expression of a potentially regulating tf.

extraction of validation knowledge
pathwaystudio  <dig>  was used to extract known, direct relations between the detfs included in the model. as these  <dig> relations are not used for the network inference process, they can be used to validate the final network.

tfbs integrating lars 
tilar uses a linear network model to construct grns based on lars
 <cit> . a particular feature of the method is the ability to integrate multiple sources of knowledge into the inference process, namely tfbs information  as well as text-mining knowledge about the regulation of tfs by the genes . tilar prohibits the direct interaction of genes but allows interaction via tfs. in that, a regulating gene modulates the activity of a tf, which in turn regulates the expression of the target gene . this concept is more biologically realistic than concepts that rely only on direct gene-to-gene interactions and copes with the known problem that the activity of transcription factors is not only regulated on the transcriptional level but also through various other mechanisms such as phosphorylation and dimerization
 <cit> . based on expression data only, the modeling of tf activity can lead to falsely inferred interactions. therefore, tilar does not model the tf activity but uses the tfbs knowledge to model them as “bridges” between the genes. this way, regulating tfs are included in the model but no additional information such as expression or activity profiles have to be known. additionally, the number of possible network structures is reduced as multiple genes can share the same tf. this concept can be expressed in the following equation: 

  x^i=∑k=1f∑j=1nwkjxjbkiwithbkj= <dig> if genejpossesses a binding site for tfk <dig> else 
ŷi=ΔxiΔt where Δxi=xi−xi and Δt= <dig> is outlined in the labels of the corresponding genes. e) the number of possible network structures is lowered by the tfbs information. additionally, auto-regulation and modeling input perturbations are introduced and increase the number of regression coefficients to estimate. f) one possible model is selected from the full set of models returned by lars. a ols approach is used to find the parameters, given the network structure of the selected model. g) the gene expression dynamics of the final network can be simulated using standard ode-solvers.

the predicted expression level
x^i of the regulated gene i is the result of the sum of the weighted expression levels wkjxj of all regulating genes j  via the transcription factor k  if  the gene i has a binding site for the tf k and  the gene j is not regulated by the tf k.

to use regression for the estimation of the parameters wkj, equation  <dig> has to be expressed in the basic regression model form
ŷ=xm×n∗β where
ŷ is the prediction vector that contains the predicted values corresponding to the observed values in the response vector y=x, β denotes for the parameters wkjand x corresponds to the regression matrix that contains the observed measurements xij  where n is the number of variables and m is the number of measurements. therefore, given a gene i  which possesses at least one tfbs, the equation  <dig> can be expressed in matrix form: 

 ŷi=xm×nf−bii∗βifori=1…n, whereŷi=xixm×nf−bii=x <dig> …,xj,…,xnf−biwithxj=x1j,…,xmjt 

  βi=β <dig> …,βk,…,βft∀kthat can bind toiwithβk=wk <dig> …,wkj,…,wkn∀jthat do not possessa tfbs fork 

the predicted expression value
ŷi of gene i is calculated using the vector of regression coefficients βi and the regression matrix xi which contains the observed expression values xjof the genes j . xi is composed of m rows and nf−bi columns, where m is the number of measurements and bidenotes for the number of tf k to gene relations where  the tf k is not regulating the gene i or  the tf k is regulating gene j or both. to estimate all parameters at once, the equations for the n genes can be jointly expressed in matrix form: 

  ŷ=xm′×n′∗βwithm′=mnrandn′=fn−b, whereŷ=xxm′×n′=withxj=tβ=β <dig> …,βk,…,βftwithβk=wk <dig> …,wkj,…,wkn∀jthat do not possessa tfbs fork 

the regression matrix x is composed of mnrrows and fn−bcolumns where nris the number of genes that possess at least one transcription factor binding site and b denotes for the number of tf-to-gene relations.

variable selection and estimation of the regression coefficients can be performed by using the least shrinkage and selection operator  algorithm, a constraint ordinary least square  approach
 <cit> . selecting a candidate vector of regression coefficients
β^=t  of the set of all possible candidate regression coefficient vectors
b^, we calculate the prediction vector
ŷi : 

  ŷi=∑j=1n′xijβ^jwithxm′×n′=x <dig> …,xi,…,xm′tandxi=xi <dig> …,xij,…,xin′ 

with the residual sum of squares  

  rss=∑i=1m′yi−ŷi <dig> 

lasso chooses the vector of regression coefficients
β^∗ which minimizes the rss 

  β^∗=argminβ^rss 

with the additional constrain 

  ∑j=1n′δj|β^j|≤s 

that the sum of the absolute regression coefficients is lower than a certain threshold s . this controls the sparseness of the resulting model. when using the adaptive lasso approach, an additional weighting parameter δj is specified  to shrink the regression coefficient
β^j and thus, support the insertion of the corresponding prior-knowledge gene-to-tf edge into the model. the modified least angle regression  algorithm was shown to produce the full set of the lasso estimates with an increased computational efficiency
 <cit> . therefore, the adaptive lars is used instead of the adaptive lasso.

extended tilar 
tilar was extended to enable the inference of gene regulatory networks from time resolved data by a system of differential equations approximated by a set of difference equations with the time interval Δt=tm−tm− <dig>  by approaching Δttowards zero, the difference equations become differential equations which can be numerically solved with standard algorithms. in extilar, the possibility to model the systems response to external perturbations as well as the possibility of auto-regulation were added to the modeling approach of tilar. it is important to note that the auto-regulation term as it is used in the model does capture the sum of all effects that might influence the abundance of the transcript such as self-regulation and rna-degradation. in that, a gene may be regulated by  other genes via tfs,  the sum of auto-regulatory effects and  the input of one or more external perturbations . thus, the parameters to estimate are assigned to gene-to-tf interactions, auto-regulation and input signal to gene interactions. the modeling concept of extilar can be expressed as: 

  xitm−xitm−1tm−tm−1=g+a+ig=∑k=1f∑j=1n1−bkjwkjxjtm−1bkia=aixitm−1i=∑c=1cdciuctm−1withbkj= <dig>  if genejpossesses abinding site for tfk <dig>  else 

according to this equation, the quotient of difference of expression
ΔxiΔt=xitm−xitm−1tm−tm− <dig> of the gene i  from the time point tm− <dig> to tm is the sum of three terms. the first term ) describes the weighted influence wkj of the regulatory genes j  at tm− <dig> on the expression level xiof gene i at tm− <dig> via the tf k . the gene i is regulated by the genes j via the tf k if,  i possesses a tfbs for k and  j is not regulated by k. this term equals the original tilar model shown in equation  <dig>  the second term ) describes the auto-regulatory effect aiat the expression level xi of gene i at tm− <dig>  the third term ) describes the influence of the input perturbation uc at tm− <dig>  as outlined in the tilar section, equation  <dig> has to be expressed in regression model form to allow parameter estimation using lars in the aforementioned way. the full set of equations for all genes is a n-coupled system and can be expressed in matrix form: 

  ŷ=xm′′×n′′∗βwithm′′=nr′randn′′=n′+u+a,whereŷ=ΔxΔt,xm′′×n′′=x <dig> …,xj,…,xn′,u <dig> …,ul,…,uu,x <dig> …,xh,…,xawithxj=x1j,…,xm′′jtul=u1l,…,um′′lxh=x1h,…,xm′′h,β=β <dig> …,βk,…,βf,β <dig> …,βc,…,βc,a <dig> …,aatwithβk=wk <dig> …,wkj,…,wknt∀jthat do not possessa tfbs fork,βc=dc <dig> …,dcj,…,dcu∀jthat can beregulated byc 

here, the regression matrix x is composed of
m′′=nr′r rows and n′′= columns.
nr′ denotes for the number of genes which have at least one tfbs  or at least one input to gene relation. because temporal information is considered in equation  <dig>  given an experiment with m time points, we calculate y as the quotient of difference of expression
ΔxΔt, which leaves us with m− <dig> measurements for each gene i .

experiments often have biological replicates for the measurements at each time point. this leads to the same time series being measured r times. as extilar makes use of these replicates by including them in the regression matrix x, there is a total of m− <dig> measurements for each gene i for each of the time-series replicates r. compared to equation  <dig>  u + acolumns are added to the regression matrix x where u is the number of input-to-gene relations and a denotes for the number of genes which are auto-regulated. since only genes, which possess at least one tfbs or at least one input-to-gene relation are considered in the rows of x, a equals
nr′.

lars can now be used to efficiently perform automatic variable selection and simultaneous regression coefficient estimation . however, for the adaptive lars it is important to notice that the δjparameter in equation  <dig> is now determining the integration of the gene-to-tf prior-knowledge edges, as well as the input-to-gene edges and the auto-regulatory edges. this way, not only prior-knowledge but also auto-regulation as well as regulation by the input can be soft-integrated into the model. the δparameter can be set between one and zero with increased integration for values close to zero.

although the introduction of these input parameters offers greater possibilities for fine-tuning of the algorithm, parameter identification is a crucial step for the inference of networks from biological data. a major problem is that the true underlying structures and processes are often unknown and the mathematical model that the inference algorithm is based on can always only be an abstraction of the truth. therefore, a good set of parameters needs to be found which leads to inferred networks that maximize the amount of integrated biological prior-knowledge and adequately reproduce the observed dynamics. regarding the integration of prior-knowledge a requirement is that the knowledge used to infer the network must be different from the knowledge that is used for its validation. an advantage of the tilar-family algorithms is that gene-to-tf knowledge is used during the inference, which can be obtained by literature text-mining. the gene-to-tf relations together with the tf-to-gene relations implicitly define gene-to-gene interaction information which can also be derived from literature. therefore, this concept of modeling makes use of two distinct prior-knowledge sets, one that is used during the network inference and one that is used for validation purposes only. the advantage of using these multiple prior-knowledge sources was shown by hecker et al. <cit> . comparing the tilar inferred static networks with the results obtained from comparable inference algorithms such as aracne, clr or lasso, they were able to show that already the introduction of tfbs knowledge yielded to better performance. moreover, they showed that an additional soft-integration of prior-knowledge further increased the reliability of the inferred gene-to-gene relationships.

network inference using extilar
for the network inference, the measured expression profiles for the  <dig> detfs as well as the mean gene expression profile for each cluster were scaled to an absolute maximum value of  <dig>  linearly interpolated data was added to provide equidistant measurements . an exponentially decreasing input function was defined to model the change of culture medium.

in an initial parameter study the auto-regulation weight and the input weight were tuned by testing  <dig> combinations of these two parameters. the best results in terms of quality of the fit , number of included prior-knowledge edges and number of the total edges was found when using an input weight of  <dig>  and an auto-regulation weight of  <dig>  . the delta parameter  which regulates the integration of prior-knowledge was set to  <dig> . this setting, which corresponds to a moderate knowledge integration ensured that the prior-knowledge is not the driving force for determining the structure but is still respected. in the second analysis we tested the influence of the delta parameter on the quality of the predicted network in terms of prior-knowledge integration, the total number of inferred edges and the fit of the simulation to the measured data. seven networks with decreasing delta value  were inferred and the resulting networks were compared. table
 <dig> shows how the prior-knowledge is soft-integrated into the network with decreasing delta and highlight that a delta value of  <dig>  offers the best balance between a high precision and a low rss. a further decrease of delta  leads to over-fitting of the network to the prior knowledge which results in a strong decrease of quality of the simulated kinetics to the measured gene expression profiles . the extilar-inferred network  using these parameters is outlined in figure
 <dig> , the simulated gene expression dynamics are plotted in figure
 <dig>  in figure

inferred input-to-gene edges which were removed from figure
 <dig> for better visualization. the network nodes  are ordered according to their absolute input-to-gene weight.

network interpretation
the inferred tfn  is composed of clusters, detfs and tfs. the clusters can be seen as functional modules representing biological processes the enclosed genes are involved in while the detfs resemble measured genes for which the corresponding protein is known to exhibit transcription factor activity. the tfs are bridging elements that connect clusters and detfs among each other. the extilar inferred tfn consists of  <dig> inferred edges, four auto-regulatory edges,  <dig> input-to-gene edges  and  <dig> gene-to-tf edges.  <dig> out of the  <dig> gene-to-tf edges are supported by prior-knowledge, which was given for the inference . the  <dig> remaining edges are predicted, novel interactions .  <dig> relations of the extracted validation knowledge were found to be integrated in the network . the negative auto-regulation edge of egr <dig> however was found to be contrary to literature knowledge from smooth muscle cells
 <cit> .

in figure
 <dig>  the node size of the modeled detfs is determined by the number of outgoing relations. notably, most of the detfs have a low outdegree while only a few of them are highly connected. this observation is an important structural property which was found to be common for biological networks. in the tfn, this hub-like role is accomplished by egr <dig> and cebpa. they are highly connected to detfs associated with diverse biological roles. sorting the absolute weights of the input-to-gene relations  reveals that egr <dig> has the highest absolute weight  just before fos, cl <dig> , cl <dig>  and e2f <dig> . cebpa appears only at the 18th position . this data shows that, according to the network, egr <dig> but not cebpa is one of the detfs initially affected by the exchange of culture medium. this finding in the network is supported by current literature knowledge which identifies especially egr <dig> as a distributing tf rather then a direct effector of physiological changes
 <cit> . the detfs of the tfn can roughly be divided into  <dig> groups describing the main biological functions observed as a response upon the exchange of the culture medium. the first group contains genes which are known to affect metabolic processes during the second  <dig> h cultivation period of primary mouse hepatocytes . the second group consists of detfs that can be associated with proliferation and regulation of the cell cycle .

regulation of metabolic processes
regulation of metabolic processes is mainly exerted by cebpa, foxa <dig>  nr1h <dig>  ppara, srf, srebf <dig> and tgif <dig>  of these detfs, cebpa plays a distributing role within this group. this is consistent with literature as the tf was described to be an important regulator of the energy metabolism
 <cit> . the connection to cluster  <dig> further highlights the importance of cebpa for processes such as the lipid and glucose metabolism
 <cit> . cluster  <dig> genes are significantly over-represented in these biological processes. interestingly, srebf <dig>  nr1h <dig> and foxa <dig> are three genes which were found to be interconnected in two double negative loops. the first loop between srebf <dig> and nr1h <dig> is partially supported by validation knowledge as nr1h <dig> is known to inhibit srebf <dig> expression
 <cit> . to our knowledge, they have not been considered in a loop jet. srebf <dig> is affecting the lipid metabolism
 <cit>  and was found to be affected by the feeding regime
 <cit> . controversially to the experimental in vitro data given here, in vivo experiments showed that the tf is decreased during fastening and increased upon re-feeding
 <cit> . like srebf <dig>  nr1h <dig> is also important for the lipid metabolism
 <cit>  and glucose homeostasis
 <cit> . additionally, the tf was found to regulate the bile acid metabolism and the metabolism of xenobiotics
 <cit> . interestingly, nr1h <dig> is thought to modulate the fasting-re-feeding transition in mice
 <cit> .

the second loop, which is supported by prior-knowledge regarding the gene-to-tf interactions is formed by foxa <dig> and nr1h <dig>  foxa <dig> is also associated with metabolic processes and plays a central role in the glucose homeostasis
 <cit> .

loops, where both edges are negatively regulating can exert a switch like function. this can lead to interesting biological features such as bistability of the system.

tgif <dig> is one of the detfs of which less is known so far. this tf was found to repress transcription of rxr and lxr target genes
 <cit> . both of these nuclear receptors are known to play important roles in the regulation of diverse metabolic functions such as the lipid and glucose metabolism. interestingly, expression of tgif <dig> is negatively related to the expression of atf <dig>  a tf that is associated to cell cycle regulation and proliferation as described in the next section. therefore, tgif <dig> might play a greater role then currently known, affecting metabolic as well as proliferative processes within hepatocytes.

proliferation and regulation of the cell cycle
hepatocytes remain in the quiescent g <dig> phase in the liver under normal conditions. events that lead to the loss of liver mass result in the release of cytokines and the subsequent activation of tfs that prime the hepatocytes for proliferation. zellmer et al. <cit>  showed that hepatocytes, cultured on collagen monolayers are primed through a cytokine independent activation of mapk signaling within  <dig> hours after isolation. they identified etf, e2f <dig> and sp <dig> as having a potentially pronounced role in mediation of the proliferative effect within the first  <dig> hours after isolation. since the present study uses the data of zellmer et al. but focuses on the second phase of the experiment , the aftereffects of the proliferation initiation and cell cycle regulation were monitored as well.

among the detfs modeled in the inferred network, regulation of proliferation and the cell cycle is mainly exerted by atf <dig>  cebpb, cebpd, dbp, e2f <dig>  fos, irf <dig> and tsc22d <dig>  within this group, fos is highly connected and regulated by seven other detfs including egr <dig>  moreover, fos was found to have the second largest input-to-gene weight. this central function is supported by the finding that fos expression is a pre-requisite for the reentry of quiescent cells into the cell cycle
 <cit> . in the tfn, fos is positively regulating irf <dig> and cebpd, both of which were found to be involved in proliferation and the cell cycle
 <cit> . interestingly, these two tfs can be found to negatively regulate fos expression in turn. irf <dig> is a gene for which the expression levels were found to be lowered after serum induced growth of serum starved cells in g <dig>  and increased before and during the s phase
 <cit> . altogether, the decreasing expression profile of fos and the continuously increasing expression profile of irf <dig> supports the finding by zellmer et al. that induction of proliferation happens in the first  <dig> hours after isolation. during the second phase however, the hepatocytes seem to be in the transition towards, or already in the s phase. the increasing expression profile of e2f <dig> is concordant with the identification of e2f <dig> as an important tf in the proliferation process. e2f <dig> was identified to repress e2f-activated transcription during the s phase, therefore balancing cell cycle control of e2f-family members such as e2f1
 <cit> .

id <dig>  atf <dig> and tsc22d <dig> are rather terminal nodes within the inferred network and are  not regulating any other detfs. this could be due to the missing available prior-knowledge regarding these detfs. atf <dig> is a transcriptional repressor that was found to delay cell cycle progression by slowing down the transition of the cell from g <dig> to s phase. it was shown that the tf also mediates positive and negative effects on proliferation
 <cit> . tsc22d <dig> is rather poorly investigated. knock-down experiments of tsc22d <dig> might reveal important functions associated to cell cycle control and proliferation in hepatocytes.

experimental validation
for experimental validation, we were interested whether or not a relation between tgif <dig> and atf <dig> expression exists. it is known that the two tfs are related as atf <dig> has a promoter binding site for smad3
 <cit> . tgif <dig> was reported to act as a corepressor by binding to the activated smad-complex 
 <cit> . altogether, this suggests that there might be a causal relation between tgif <dig> expression and atf <dig> expression in hepatocytes. however, to our best knowledge, a relation between these two tfs has not been shown so far.

to investigate the effect that a tgif <dig> knock-down might have on the system, we performed an in silico knock-down using the inferred tfn . therefore, the logarithmized expression profile of tgif <dig> was replaced by a linear decreasing function ranging from  <dig> at the 0h time point to - <dig> at the  <dig> h time point. simulation of the network predicted an increase in atf <dig>  cebpb and klf <dig>  and a decrease in dbp. analysis of the network shows that the increase in cebpb and klf <dig> both result from the decrease of dbp, whereas the predicted increase in atf <dig> is a result of the loss of repression by tgif <dig> and the increase in cebpb. therefore, we also looked at dbp expression, as this tf is directly regulated by tgif <dig> in the network.

for validation, a real sirna-mediated knockdown of tgif <dig> in cultured hepatocytes was carried out. at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours after transfection of the tgif <dig> sirna, expression levels of atf <dig> and dbp were measured using quantitative real time pcr .an unambiguous upregulation of atf <dig> and a downregulation of dbp were detected . regarding the inhibition of atf <dig> expression, this indicates that tgif <dig> does not only play a role in altering metabolic processes such as lipid metabolism but might also positively affect hepatic proliferation and cell cycle regulation. the exact mechanism of repression however remains to be resolved, as three different modes of repression are currently known
 <cit> . the downregulation of dbp, although less severe, is of strong interest as it was shown that the expression of important cytochrome p <dig> family members is partially under the regulation of dbp
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, the linear model of the recently published network inference algorithm tilar was extended to infer ode based network models. with this approach, the extilar algorithm combines the benefits of the regression based tilar  with the possibilities that ode based models offer . using a 5-node network to create in silico data we were able to show that extilar and netgenerator inferred networks are of high quality with a performance advantage of extilar over the netgenerator . to make the algorithm easily accessible to the scientific community, we implemented extilar in r. together with the additional material, extilar can be downloaded from

applying the algorithm to biological data, we were able to present a tfn that models the main biological processes induced in hepatocytes upon culture medium exchange. we highlighted two possible regulatory loops between srebf <dig>  nr1h <dig> and foxa <dig>  the function of these interesting network motifs will be motivation for further studies. using a knock-down experiment read out by qrt-pcr, the biological relevance of the inferred network was shown by the validation of two hypothesized relations between tgif <dig> and atf <dig>  and between tgif <dig> and dbp. thereby, we detected new, potential functions of tgif <dig> and further highlight the tf’s importance in the hepatic transcription factor network. although the exact mechanism of regulation remains to be clarified, this example highlights how extilar can be successfully used combining various prior-knowledge sources to infer biologically relevant, data supported regulatory networks.
