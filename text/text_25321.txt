BACKGROUND
worldwide, tuberculosis  remains one of the leading infectious diseases, accounting for nearly  <dig> millions deaths and over  <dig> million new cases annually  <cit> . the vast majority of tb cases occur in developing or emerging countries, particularly in africa, south-east-asia and the countries of the former soviet-union. among them are up to 20% multidrug-resistant strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis   <cit> . in the control of the spread of tb, accurate and early laboratory diagnosis plays an important role.

diagnosis of tb relies on the detection of acid-fast bacilli  by microscopy  and culture followed by identification of isolates  <cit> . microscopy is rapid and inexpensive but has a low sensitivity . culture is slow but more sensitive, detecting as few as  <dig> tb bacilli per ml. so far, culture is considered the "gold standard" for laboratory confirmation of tb. the main disadvantage is its slowness and therewith the delay in diagnostic of tb of up to several weeks.

a major breakthrough in diagnosis of tb was therefore achieved by the introduction of nucleic acid amplification techniques  to detect m. tuberculosis complex  directly in clinical specimens, which can give results within one day. compared to microscopy, the value of naat lies  in its greater positive predictive values with smear-positive specimens in settings in which non-tuberculous mycobacteria are common, and  in the possibility to rapidly confirm the presence of mtb in  <dig> - 80% of smear-negative tb cases  <cit> . thus, compared to culture, naat can detect the presence of mtb weeks earlier for  <dig> - 90% of patients suspected to have pulmonary tb. these advantages can significantly improve patient care and tb control efforts.

there are currently several commercial naat methods available of which each uses a different method to amplify specific nucleic acid sequences of mtbc. these include, for example, the roche cobas amplicor mtb test, the genprobe amplified m. tuberculosis direct test , the bd probetec-et or the hain genotype mycobacteria direct assay . available real-time polymerase chain reactions  systems are, for example, the roche cobas taqman mtb  test and the cepheid xpert mtb test. a series of evaluation studies  <cit>  have analysed and compared the accuracy of commercial naats in both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tb. they show that most of the naats have high and consistent specificity and good positive predictive values but modest and variable sensitivity, particularly in smear-negative and extra-pulmonary tb.

an important issue is the implementation of naats in developing countries with high tb burden. however, prizes of commercial kits including required precision instruments are not affordable for most of the countries with high tb burden. therefore, many of these countries use poorly validated in-house pcrs which show more variability in their accuracy  <cit> . there is a high demand for well validated, affordable commercial naats for use in low-resource countries.

a novel commercial naat, which meets the demands for a low cost system, has been recently introduced. the hyplex® tbc test  is a qualitative system for the detection of members of the mtbc and is based on multiplex pcr followed by reverse hybridisation to specific oligonucleotide probes and elisa detection.

in the present study we performed a clinical evaluation of the hyplex® tbc test using well-characterised tb and non-tb samples. pcr data were compared to the results of conventional microscopy and culture techniques. finally, the potential impact of hyplex® tbc test on laboratory diagnostics of tb was assessed.

RESULTS
in the present study, we performed a comprehensive clinical evaluation of the hyplex® tbc pcr in order to estimate and optimise its diagnostic potential. a total of  <dig> clinical specimens from our frozen archive were included comprising  <dig> tb samples and  <dig> non-tb samples .

cut-off validation
the read-out end-point of the hyplex® tbc test is an optical density  value of the elisa after reverse hybridisation. in an initial step, we determined the best cut-off value for the discrimination of tb and non-tb specimens by means of a roc  curve analysis. therefore, the sensitivity of the test was determined for each potential cut-off value between  <dig>  and  <dig>  and plotted against the rate of false positive results . the criteria of the best cut-off were defined as  a false-positive rate as low as possible ranging at least below 1% in order to minimise the risk of the false diagnosis of a tb, and  a sensitivity as high as possible. the optimal cut-value was set to an od of  <dig> , where the false-positive rate was  <dig> % with sensitivity over 80% considering all specimens.

inhibition rate
the version of the hyplex® tbc test used in this study contained hybridisation modules for an internal control  allowing for the detection of inhibitors of the pcr amplification. in general, samples with an odic <  <dig>  were considered as inhibited as long as the tbc pcr was negative . twenty-four out of the  <dig> samples  were excluded from further analysis due to inhibition of the test reaction . a higher rate of inhibition was found in the non-tb group  compared to the tb group . when looking at the different types of specimens, the highest rate of inhibition was found with urine samples . among samples of respiratory origin, bronchial/tracheal secretes showed the highest rate of inhibition , followed by bronchoalveolar lavage   and sputum  .

sensitivity
of the remaining  <dig> samples without inhibitors,  <dig> were classified as tb samples based on the detection of mtb in culture . of these,  <dig>  were smear-positive and  <dig>  were smear-negative.  <dig> of  <dig> samples were considered as non-tb group based on negative cultures for mtb. among these, culture of  <dig> samples revealed non-tuberculous mycobacteria . overall,  <dig> of  <dig>  yielded positive pcr results , and  <dig> negative results .

of the  <dig> tb culture positive samples,  <dig> gave positive pcr results yielding an overall sensitivity of  <dig> % . the sensitivity for smear-positive specimens  was  <dig> %, for smear-negative specimens   <dig> %. similar sensitivities were calculated considering respiratory tb specimens only : the overall sensitivity was  <dig> %; the sensitivities for smear-positive and smear-negative samples were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. among non-respiratory samples, all smear-positive tb samples  and seven out of eight smear-negative tb samples were detected by pcr .

false negatives
fifteen out of  <dig> culture and smear-positive tb samples  were negative by hyplex® tbc pcr . repeat testing of these false-negative samples also yielded negative results with hyplex® tbc. the existence of inhibitors could be excluded in the samples by high odic values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . only one sample showed a somewhat lower odic which was however still above the cut-off  indicating the presence of some inhibiting factors which could have influenced the tb-specific pcr. all false-negative samples  were re-assessed by the ctm pcr test, a real-time pcr system based on mtbc specific sequences within the 16s rrna genes. positive pcr results were obtained with all specimens tested but one . these data indicate that a small proportion of tb positive samples  were indeed not recognized by the hyplex® tbc system.

specificity
of the  <dig> non-tb samples,  <dig> gave negative pcr results yielding a specificity of  <dig> %. a specificity of  <dig> % was obtained for non-tb samples excluding cases of infection with ntms . considering ntm samples only , the specificity was 95%. similar values were obtained for respiratory non-tb samples  . among the non-respiratory samples, all culture negative samples  gave also negative pcr results .

false positives
seven out of the  <dig> mtb culture-negative specimens were initially hyplex® tbc pcr positive and considered as false-positives. assessment of these samples by ctm pcr gave negative results with all seven samples. five of these samples were also clearly negative on repeat with the hyplex® tbc pcr, while in two samples, the positive values of the first runs were confirmed on repeat. one of these two specimens gave a positive culture for m. intracellulare, the other one showed no mycobacterial growth on culture. together, based on merged pcr data and culture results, two out of  <dig> mtb culture negative specimens  were finally classified as false-positive hyplex® tbc pcr results .

positive and negative predictive values
positive  and negative  predictive values largely depend on the prevalence of a disease. in particular, with low prevalence, the specificity of a test has to be very high, otherwise the ppv of the test will be poor. the proportion of tb samples  included in this study was rather high and did not reflect the real situation of a tb diagnostic laboratory. in our laboratory, real time pcr  yields between  <dig> % and  <dig> % positive results, depending on year and season. assuming a mean rate of 8% of tb positive samples and a number of approximately  <dig> pcr assays per year, the ppv of the hyplex® tbc test would be calculated to  <dig> %, and the npv to  <dig> % , based on the sensitivity and specificity values found in this study .

a based on the assumption of a mean rate of  <dig> % true tb positive specimens and a total number of  <dig> specimens in a routine tb laboratory per year, the resulting numbers of tb positive and negative samples were calculated.

b based on the specificity and sensitivity values found in this study, the numbers of expected pcr positive and negative results among  <dig> were calculated. resulting numerical values were rounded.

c positive and negative predictive values were deduced from calculated pcr positive and negative results.

finally, the validity of the hyplex® tbc test was determined using an od cut-off value for positive results of  <dig>  as given in the instructions of the manufacturer. using this value, the sensitivity of the test would rise to 92% while the specificity would decrease to 85% . the ppv and npv deduced from these sensitivity and specificity estimates would be calculated to  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . thus, the ppv of the hyplex® tbc test is dramatically decreasing when the cut-off is changed to od  <dig> , meaning that out of  <dig> pcr-positive results only  <dig> truly indicate tb. furthermore, the rate of false positives of 15% at cut-off of od  <dig>  would be above the acceptable limit.

discussion
the hyplex® tbc pcr test is a new qualitative diagnostic naat system for the detection of mtbc in human specimens. compared to most of the available commercial naat tests, which range from about  <dig> to  <dig> euro  per test, it represents a low-cost system. costs of the hyplex® tbc test are estimated to ten to twelve euro per test in industrialised countries. for developing countries, where most of the tb occurs, significantly lower prices can be considered. in contrast to real-time assays which require precision instruments as well as capacity to maintain these instruments, the hyplex® tbc test can be applied in all laboratories with standard equipment for molecular biology techniques and, therefore, allows for the application also in low-budget laboratories, particularly in developing and emerging countries. however, the low costs of equipment and reagents go along with a significant increase in the hands-on time. whereas highly automated tests like real-time assays may generate results within less than two hours with very low hands-on time, the hyplex® tbc test requires multiple workstations for specimen preparation, target amplification and amplicon detection. including column-based dna preparation, the assay will take up to  <dig> hours to perform. this is comparable to other naat assays which are largely performed manually like, for example, the gtmd assay  <cit> . similar to other naat assays, the hyplex® tbc test is certainly suitable for partial automatation, for example by use of full automated systems for hybridisation and elisa reading, which can significantly decrease the hands-on time of the test.

initially, the hyplex® tbc pcr test was validated by the manufacturer using a set of  <dig> clinical specimens . in order to retrieve the highest sensitivity possible, the cut-off value was set to  <dig>  in the manufacturer's instructions. this cut-off was technically controlled using dna of different mycobacterium and non-mycobacterial species. none of  <dig> different strains of different species other than mycobacterium was positive . out of  <dig> mycobacterium strains, five mtbc strains  were positive. twenty-eight ntm strains of  <dig> different species were tested and three  gave elisa signals of about od  <dig>  that were considered positive following the instructions of the manufacturer. thus, the "technical" sensitivity can theoretically be assumed 100%, while the technical specificity would be only  <dig> % given a cut-off value of od  <dig> . using the same cut-off, the sensitivity in our study set would be 92%, but the specificity would be as low as 85%, meaning that every seventh positive pcr result would be a false-positive one. however, the improved sensitivity by use of cut-off value  <dig>  does not justify the risk of a false-positive diagnosis of tb in 15% of cases. therefore, following our roc analysis the optimal cut-off value of the hyplex® tbc pcr assay was set to an od of  <dig>  in our study. using this corrected value, the technical specificity determined by the manufacturer would indeed rise to 100%, while diagnostic sensitivity and specificity still range within reasonable limits.

the hyplex® tbc offers an overall sensitivity of  <dig> % and a specificity of  <dig> %, when compared to culture results as standard reference. the overall sensitivity of  <dig> % was similar to that found for other naat assays which tested respiratory and non-respiratory specimens   <cit> . in contrast to some other studies which found significantly reduced sensitivities for non-respiratory specimens with various naats  <cit> , the hyplex® tbc assay even showed a higher sensitivity for non-respiratory samples . resolving against smear-negative specimens, the sensitivity of the hyplex® tbc test was rather in the lower range  when compared to other naat assays   <cit> . resolving against smear-positive specimens only, the sensitivity of the hyplex® tbc test  was in accordance with other naat assays   <cit> . the overall specificity estimate of  <dig> % for hyplex® tbc was remarkably high compared to other naat assays   <cit>  and even ranged clearly above the pooled specificity of 97% found by meta-analysis  <cit> .

the positive and negative predictive values  were calculated from specificity and sensitivity estimates found in this study after extrapolation to a total number of  <dig> specimens per year and a prevalence of true tb positive specimens of 8%. when compared to other evaluation studies which were based on similar rates of true tb positive samples   <cit> , the ppv of  <dig> % of the hyplex® tbc was in the lower third  whereas the npv of  <dig> % turned out excellent . in many studies, the prevalence of positive specimens in the respective setting of routine diagnostics was not included in the calculation of the ppv and npv. this resulted mostly in an overestimation of the significance of the values. additionally, the values are influenced by factors like the selection of specimens. for these reasons, the comparison of ppv and npv with former studies and other assays is rather difficult.

only two non-tb samples were finally classified as false-positive. in one of them grew m. intracellulare. it is unlikely that the positive pcr resulted from a dual infection of the patient with m. intracellulare and mtb. furthermore, the absence of mtb dna in this specimen was assessed by ctm pcr. speculatively, some unspecific binding of the ntm amplification product to tbc-specific probes could have caused this false-positive result. false-positive pcr results due to sporadic cross-reactivity with non-tuberculous mycobacteria has been suspected earlier also with other naat systems  <cit> . as the technical validation of the hyplex® tbc kit had indeed shown some unspecific binding for single mycobacterium species, it would be possible also for the m. intracellulare. the second false-positive specimen originated from a case without a known mtb infection. it cannot be ruled out completely that very low amounts of mtb nucleic acids originating from an early tb infection may have led to positive pcr results with hyplex® tbc.

among smear-negative, culture-positive specimens,  <dig> out of  <dig> were not detected by hyplex® tbc. this was, at least in part, due to the fact that the cut-off has been increased from od  <dig>  to od  <dig>  in order to reduce the false-positive rate to a minimum. it would certainly be worth trying, whether the sensitivity could be increased by applying higher volumes of sample. our evaluation was performed with a sample volume of  <dig> μl, but theoretically sample volumes up to  <dig> μl can be applied. however, too much dna may considerably reduce the effectiveness of a pcr and, in return, would lead to a higher rate of inhibition. the optimal volume of specimen needs to be determined in further investigations.

seven percents of smear-positive, culture-positive samples also escaped the detection by hyplex® tbc. it is unlikely that this was caused solely by too low amounts of mtb dna, since most of these specimens yielded clearly positive smear microscopy results  and re-assessment by ctm pcr gave positive results with  <dig> of  <dig> specimens. the hyplex® tbc pcr is based on target sequences of a house keeping gene. it can be speculated that missing of some of these tb samples by hyplex® tbc was related to single nucleotide polymorphisms within this gene. this question should be studied and the results may certainly help to optimise the oligonucleotide probes used in the kit.

CONCLUSIONS
hyplex® tbc is an accurate and reliable naat assay for the direct detection of mtb in respiratory and non-respiratory specimens. similar to other commercial naats, the hyplex® tbc assay is impacted by the compromise between specificity and sensitivity: specificity is maximised at the cost of sensitivity. compared to other commercial naat systems, the hyplex® tbc assay shows excellent specificity estimates but slightly lower sensitivity, in particular for smear-negative tb specimens. also, when the assay is used as rapid confirmation test for smear-positive specimens one should be aware of the fact that a small percentage of tb infections may be not detected. as it holds true also for other naat assays, hyplex® tbc test cannot replace culture but should be always carefully interpreted along with clinical data and conventional tests.
