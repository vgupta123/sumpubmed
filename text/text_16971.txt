BACKGROUND
it is estimated that one third of the world’s population is infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis and that each year about nine million people develop tuberculosis , one million  of whom are children under  <dig> years of age  <cit> . a unique aspect of tb in children is the rapid progression to disease, typically within the first year following infection, unlike in adults, where tb infection can persist for decades without progression into an active infection  <cit> . bacteriological confirmation in the diagnosis of childhood tb is the exception rather than the rule with culture remaining negative in around 70% of cases with probable tb  <cit> . using blood transcriptional profiling, several signature gene sets have been identified in adult cohorts from south africa, the gambia and the united kingdom  <cit> . however, a significant overlap was shown with a biomarker set for sarcoidosis, suggesting the need for more specific biomarker sets  <cit> . to statistically verify differential expression between active tb, latent tb infection  and healthy controls  different methods have been used, varying from statistical tests  <cit>  to prediction models using the k-nearest neighbours algorithm  <cit> . correlation analysis, a method selecting genes that are correlated with a single differentially expressed gene, was used to identify a biomarker set in a gambian cohort  <cit> . no studies applying gene expression profiling of children with tb have been published, and it is unknown whether the existing signature gene sets are applicable to childhood cohorts.

in venezuela, a high tb incidence rate  has been reported in warao amerindian children living in the orinoco delta in northeastern venezuela  <cit> . in this study, we identified new gene signatures in childhood tb by comparing gene expression profiles of warao amerindian children with tb, ltbi and hc. we validated the identified gene signatures from this study in an independent cohort of children with ltbi, hc or non-tb pneumonia. furthermore, we estimated the predictive value of our gene signatures in previously performed adult studies and we compared the discriminatory power of the literature signature gene sets with our gene set.

RESULTS
identification of signature genes
genome-wide transcription profiles in whole blood from  <dig> tb patients,  <dig> ltbi and  <dig> hc were generated using affymetrix exon arrays comprising approximately one million probes, which are mapped to  <dig> unique features . general characteristics of the study subjects are given in table  <dig>  detailed information of the study subjects is given in additional file 1: table s <dig>  random forest analyses were performed to find the signature gene sets used to interrogate whether donors within this study could be divided into distinct groups based on their gene expression profiles. irrelevant genes were removed from the signature set using the random forest-based local importance measure as described in phenolink  <cit> . a total of  <dig> genes were removed in the initial step and the classification or out of bag  error decreased substantially from 70% to 22%. next, genes contributing to the correct classification of at least three samples of the same class were selected resulting in a removal of a total of  <dig> genes and a decrease of the oob error to approximately 11%. the reduced dataset consisting of  <dig> genes allowed separation of the three classes with class errors of 11%, 22%, and 0% for the respective classes of tb, ltbi and hc . unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of this  <dig> gene profile showed that all  <dig> individuals could be successfully clustered into three groups, and each group matched to the corresponding grouping of tb, ltbi and hc . functional annotation of the  <dig> genes revealed that genes in the categories of cell proliferation, cell death, phosphorylation and calcium binding were enriched. a full list of enriched gene sets analyzed by the online david tool  <cit>  is provided as supplemental information .


validation of signature gene sets in independent sample sets
in order to confirm the value of our identified gene set in comparison with existing signature gene sets in all available cohorts that used whole blood gene expression  <cit> , we performed random forest classification of the datasets with all signature gene sets to distinguish tb from ltbi and to distinguish tb, ltbi and hc. the average prediction error for the classification of tb and ltbi patients identified by berry et al. <cit>  using our 116-gene signature set was  <dig> % . the average error for the two sets of maertzdorf et al. <cit>  was respectively  <dig> % and  <dig> % . comparison of the other literature sets with each other showed similar average prediction errors when one set was used to discriminate individuals in the other set. however, while our 116-gene set showed a good predictive value for both the childhood cohort described in this study as well as for the adult cohorts identified in other studies, the gene sets identified in those adult studies did not discriminate the children included in our study adequately ). as berry et al. provided demographic characteristics of the subjects included in their study  <cit> , we were able to examine whether these demographic characteristics were related to the chance that a subject with tb was wrongly classified as ltbi using our  <dig> gene set. multivariable linear regression analysis showed that age and gender were not significantly associated with wrong classification of tb subjects. in contrast, tb patients from south africa were significantly more often wrongly classified as ltbi than tb patients from london .

identification of the minimal discriminatory signature gene sets
a minimal discriminatory gene set to discriminate between tb and ltbi was identified by variable selection random forest   <cit> . this procedure produced four genes for the set described in this manuscript, three genes for the dataset described by berry et al. <cit> , three genes for the dataset described by maertzdorf et al. <cit>  and two genes for the other dataset described by maertzdorf et al. <cit>  that are required to distinguish tb from ltbi samples . after removal of the overlaps, i.e. the genes that were selected in more than one dataset, nine genes remained . similarly, a minimal gene set to distinguish tb from ltbi and from hc was identified. in this comparison, six genes were identified for the set described in this manuscript and respectively  <dig>  three, and  <dig> genes were identified for the three other datasets  <cit>  . after removal of the overlaps,  <dig> genes remained . performance of these minimal sets was comparable to performance of the  <dig> gene set . however, as only a few genes included in the minimal sets were present in more than one of the datasets, the selected minimal sets seem to be a summary of four small sets that perform well on each of the included datasets rather than a robust representative set that would perform well in ethnically different populations.

identification and validation of the optimal signature gene set
because of potential problems with the extrapolation of the minimal gene signature datasets to other populations due to overfitting of these gene sets on the source datasets, we selected ten genes from the random forest signature 116-gene set that were highly discriminative between the three groups of tb, ltbi and hc in our set of warao amerindian children. furthermore, the ten selected genes were consistently selected in the bootstrapping procedure implemented in varselfrf from the set of berry et al.  and from the two sets of maertzdorf et al. . additional file 3: table s <dig> shows the variable frequencies estimated by the bootstrapping procedure per probe per dataset. the selection of ten genes out of these  <dig> genes consisted of chrm <dig>  amph, snx <dig>  pigc, tas2r <dig>  and hbd, gldc, acot <dig>  s100p and styxl <dig> . these ten selected genes had the highest variable frequency in .632+ bootstrapped runs of the  <dig> discriminatory gene set in all cohorts, meaning that they were most frequently present in the trees of the random forest analyses performed . their possible role in tb, lung disease or inflammatory processes is displayed in table  <dig>  while the minimal set was a mere combination of genes that had a good predictive value for active tb in each of the source databases, the robust ten gene set represents a set of genes that perform well in the discrimination of active tb from ltbi and hc in all datasets used for its composition and probably also as in future cohorts from other study sites. the overlap between the minimal nine gene set for tb vs. ltbi and the robust ten gene set consisted of three genes  and the overlap between the minimal  <dig> gene set for tb vs. ltbi vs. hc and the robust ten gene set consisted of seven genes .


for validation of the ten genes included in the robust ten gene set, we carried out quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  studies using the same samples as used for the microarray experiment. additionally, we tested our identified set of ten genes in  <dig> additional samples  from warao amerindian children aged  <dig> to  <dig> years. furthermore, from three children with tb a recovery sample taken five months after initiation of anti-tb treatment was tested with qrt-pcr. analysis of the qrt-pcr data showed that s100p , gldc  and hbd  significantly discriminated tb from ltbi while pigc , snx <dig> , tas2r <dig>  and hbd  significantly discriminated tb cases from hc. tb cases were separated from non-tb pneumonia cases based on expression of snx <dig>  and hbd . active tb cases were separated from all other groups  based on expression of pigc , gldc  and hbd . the values of area under receiver operating characteristic  curve  of these genes are shown in table  <dig>  the quantitative results of qrt-pcr analyses are shown in additional file 4: figure s <dig> and additional file 5: table s <dig>  decision tree analysis indicated that five genes  were sufficient to classify 78% of the tb cases correctly with no false-positives among the children with ltbi . among the hc and non-tb pneumonia cases, false positive rates were 4% and 11% respectively . interestingly, following this decision tree, the follow-up samples that were taken from three of the nine tb patients when they had received five months of anti-tb treatment were no longer classified as tb while the samples taken on inclusion of these patients were correctly classified as tb.


discussion
although peripheral blood transcriptional signatures discriminating between tb, ltbi and hc subjects have been identified in adult studies  <cit> , concerns about the specificity of these signature sets have been raised  <cit> . furthermore, the performance of these signature sets in children, that show high rates of progressive tuberculosis due to immaturity of the immune response, has not been investigated so far. in this study, we identified a  <dig> signature gene set that discriminated tb from ltbi and hc with class errors of 11%, 22%, and 0% for the respective classes of tb, ltbi and hc . while this  <dig> gene signature set also showed a good discriminative value between tb and ltbi in adults from south africa, the gambia and the united kingdom, signature sets that were identified in those adult cohorts were unable to discriminate tb from ltbi in our childhood cohort .

gene clusters that were enriched in our signature set included genes in the categories of  cell death and calcium binding . both the gambian as well as the south-african study of maertzdorf et al. <cit>  also described enrichment of genes involved in cell death. other similarities between the functional annotations in the south african study  <cit>  and our study are the enrichment of genes involved in regulation of cell proliferation, regulation of caspase activity and protein kinase activity. specifically, cd <dig> was identified as the most powerful discriminating gene seperating tb from ltbi cases in the south african study  <cit> . as cd <dig> has also been identified as a marker for general innate immune response activity and sepsis, this marker may not be specific to tb  <cit> . berry et al. observed that genes downstream of type i interferon-αβ receptor signaling were over-respresented in patients with active tb  <cit> . however, type i inferferon signaling is also induced in response to respiratory viruses  <cit>  and streptococcus pneumoniae <cit> , questioning the specificity of genes involved in type i interferon receptor signaling as biomarkers for active tb.

the enrichment of genes involved in calcium signaling in our tb biomarker set has not been described before in adult studies using whole-blood gene expression  <cit> , nor in studies based on transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells   <cit> . a close relation between abnormal calcium metabolism and radiological extent of disease has been described in pulmonary tb patients  <cit> . alterations in serum calcium, particularly cases of hypercalcemia, have been observed in adult tb patients  <cit> . hypercalcemia in pediatric tb patients is an infrequently recognized and poorly understood phenomenon  <cit> . in lung tissue, several processes related to calcium homeostasis are thought to contribute to m. tuberculosis persistence and the aggregation of macrophages in granulomas. over-production of  <dig> -dihydroxyvitamin d <dig>  which plays a traditional role in calcium metabolism, in alveolar macrophages in granulomas has a protective effect against oxidative injuries from the nitric oxide burst from granulomatous macrophages  <cit> . furthermore, m. tuberculosis inhibits a calcium-dependent phagolysosome formation pathway which leads to the prevention of maturation of m. tuberculosis-containing phagosomes into phagolysosomes. this process, referred to as the m. tuberculosis phagosome maturation arrest, is critical for m. tuberculosis persistence in the human host  <cit> . s100p, which significantly discriminated tb from ltbi in our study children, and tas2r <dig>  which significantly distinguished tb cases from hc, are genes involved in calcium signaling  <cit> . possibly, altered expression of these genes in tb patients reflects m. tuberculosis-mediated changes in calcium metabolism in lung tissue that can be measured in peripheral whole blood.

although the groups of tb, ltbi and hc were reasonably well age-matched , we cannot exclude the possibility that age-dependent differences in immune responses have influenced gene expression profiles. age-related differences in both innate as well as antigen-specific responses to m. tuberculosis are well recognised  <cit> . alveolar macrophage antimicrobial activity and recruitment of monocytes as well as the production of cytokines and certain aspects of antigen presentation appear to be less efficient in young children. this is particularly true in children younger than one year of age  <cit> . therefore, the exclusion of children less than one year of age in our study is likely to have prevented a significant influence of age-related immune differences on gene expression results. furthermore, the signature set that we identified showed a good discriminative value between tb and ltbi in adults from several regions  <cit> . this is an indication that the genes that were selected in our analysis make up a signature set that performs well in individuals of all ages.

we identified a minimal gene set of  <dig> genes that was able to separate tb cases from ltbi and hc in all previously described  cohorts  <cit>  as well as in our childhood cohort. however, as this minimal set was possibly over-optimized to fit exactly those sets that were used for its composition, this set might not perform well in a newly identified cohort from a different geographic region. as the datasets used for the composition of the minimal set were based on european, african and south american populations the minimal set may not be applicable to individuals from asia, while this region carries almost two-third of the global tb burden  <cit> . furthermore, this signature set could be only indicative of damage to the lung epithelium, similar to what has been described for the overlap of the gene set determined by berry et al. <cit>  and the biosignature characteristic for sarcoidosis  <cit> . therefore, we used bootstrapping procedures to select a robust set of ten genes that had a high discriminative value in our population, in the two populations described by maertzdorf et al. <cit>  and in the comparison between tb, ltbi, hc and other inflammatory and infectious diseases in the dataset of berry et al. <cit> . although this approach probably leads to less overfitting of the selected set towards the source databases used and less overlap with other infectious diseases in comparison with the minimal gene set we identified, the discriminatory power of this ten gene set is less than that of the minimal set . future cohorts can be of help in the reduction of the  <dig> gene set to a dataset with similar performance in discriminating tb from ltbi, hc and other inflammatory diseases as the minimal gene set without overfitting the dataset to the source datasets.

from the ten gene set, a combination of five  could be used in decision tree analysis to differentiate tb from ltbi, hc and non-tb pneumonia with 78% sensitivity and 96% specificity in our dataset . additionally, the expression profile of children that were treated for tb shifted from an active tb classification  towards a classification as not suffering from active tb  at five months post treatment initiation. this indicates that these biomarkers reflect a dynamic response that changes as mycobactericidal activity diminishes.

the discriminatory value of the  <dig> gene signature set for the classification of cases in the cohort described by berry and colleagues  <cit>  was significantly better in people from london compared to people from south africa. an explanation for the greater similarity between our study population with people from london than with people from south africa comes from population-genetic studies in which a decrease in the level of genetic variation between populations is observed with increasing geographic distance from africa, consistent with the out-of-africa spread of human populations  <cit> . the finding that previously published signature sets based on individuals from south africa  <cit>  do not provide a good discriminatory value between tb, ltbi and hc in the gambia  <cit>  points towards a high heterozygosity in tb immune response between different african countries. a high-resolution survey of genotype variation based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms, copy-number variants and haplotype analysis of a worldwide sample of  <dig> populations revealed that the genetic distance between individuals from asia and native american or colombian individuals is significantly less than the genetic distance between asian and south african populations  <cit> . bayesian cluster analysis clustered individuals from east asia together with native american or colombian individuals, indicating their close phylogenetic relationship  <cit> . clustering of native american individuals with asian individuals based on their genetic similarities was also observed in a recently published quantitative assessment of human genetic variation worldwide  <cit> . therefore, we speculate that the applicability of our signature set in asian populations might be better than the applicability of sets identified in african or european populations.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a signature gene set that was demonstrated to be instrumental for the diagnosis of childhood tb. as the identification of different biomarkers in ethnically distinct cohorts is apparent, it is important to cross-validate newly identified markers in all available cohorts. especially, more childhood cohorts should be investigated as tb diagnosis based on traditional methods is less sensitive and specific in children compared to adults.
