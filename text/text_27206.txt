BACKGROUND
the genus bordetella comprises nine species, of which four are exclusively respiratory pathogens of mammalian hosts: bordetella bronchiseptica, bordetella parapertussis, bordetella pertussis and bordetella holmesii  <cit> . the first three species are closely related, while b. holmesii forms a distinct branch  <cit> . b. bronchiseptica causes chronic and often asymptomatic respiratory tract infections in a wide variety of mammals and is only sporadically isolated from humans. b. parapertussis consists of two distinct lineages, designated b. parapertussishu and b. parapertussisov, which infect humans and sheep respectively  <cit> . b. parapertussishu and b. pertussis are exclusive human pathogens and the causative agents of pertussis or whooping cough. both these species have evolved independently from a b. bronchiseptica-like ancestor, a process which has been accompanied by extensive gene loss  <cit> .

by far, most cases of whooping cough are caused by b. pertussis. despite widespread vaccination, pertussis remains a major cause of infant death worldwide  <cit> . in the 1990s a resurgence of pertussis was observed in several countries with highly vaccinated populations and pertussis has become the most prevalent vaccine-preventable disease in developed countries  <cit> . in the netherlands, the estimated rate of infection was  <dig> % per year for the 3-79-year age group from  <dig> through  <dig>  <cit> . similar percentages have been found in the united states  <cit> . one of the hallmarks of the pertussis resurgence is a shift in disease prevalence towards older persons who have waning vaccine-induced immunity, while recently vaccinated infants are well protected  <cit> . the reemergence of pertussis has been attributed to various factors including decreased vaccination coverage due to concerns over side effects, suboptimal vaccines, waning vaccine-induced immunity, and adaptation of b. pertussis  <cit> . the relative contribution of these factors may differ between countries and is the subject of ongoing debate. pathogen adaptation is supported by several observations. we and others have shown that antigenic divergence has occurred between vaccine strains and clinical isolates with respect to surface proteins which confer protective immunity; pertussis toxin , pertactin and fimbriae  <cit> . further, in a mouse model, pertussis vaccines were less effective against strains carrying non-vaccine type antigens compared to strains with vaccine-type antigens  <cit> . recently we found evidence that polymorphism in the promoter for ptx  may also be important in adaptation  <cit> . in the last twenty years two ptxp alleles, ptxp <dig> and ptxp <dig>  predominated in the dutch b. pertussis population. the ptxp <dig> strains were first observed in  <dig>  gradually increased in frequency, and nearly completely replaced the resident ptxp <dig> strains in the late 1990s. in the netherlands, the increase in frequency of ptxp <dig> strains was associated with the resurgence of pertussis. the ptxp <dig> strains are found in asia, europe, north and south america, and there is evidence that they have spread worldwide in the 1980s and 1990s  <cit> . the ptxp <dig> strains produced more ptx than the ptxp <dig> strain and epidemiological data suggest that ptxp <dig> strains are more virulent. ptx suppresses both the innate and adaptive immune system  <cit>  and we have proposed that increased ptx production increases pathogen fitness in vaccinated populations by enhancing transmission by hosts in which vaccine immunity has waned. thus, both antigenic divergence and increased immune suppression in combination with waning immunity are likely to contribute to the pertussis resurgence  <cit> . here we extend our studies on adaptation of b. pertussis using comparative genomics. we determined, annotated and compared genome sequences of six dutch strains, two of which were isolated before vaccination was introduced in  <dig> and four modern strains, isolated approximately  <dig> years later. the modern strains carried either the ptxp <dig> allele or the ptxp <dig> allele, while the pre-vaccination strains carried ptxp <dig> or ptxp <dig>  we identified novel polymorphisms in specific genes and gene categories which may play a role in the persistence and resurgence of pertussis in the face of intensive vaccination.

RESULTS
strain selection
our long term aim is to identify b. pertussis loci which have contributed to the persistence and resurgence of pertussis in vaccinated populations. we selected two strains isolated in  <dig> and  <dig> which were characteristic for the dutch b. pertussis population in the pre-vaccine era  <cit> , and four modern strains isolated in  <dig> and  <dig>  approximately  <dig> years after the introduction of vaccination. two of the modern strains carried the ptxp <dig> allele and two the ptxp <dig> allele. in our comparisons, we included the tohama i strain  of which the annotated genome sequence was available  <cit> . the tohama i strain was isolated in japan in the 1950s and has been subcultured in vitro extensively. it is used as model strain in many different laboratories. strain characteristics are listed in table  <dig> 

 <dig> year of isolation and alleles of main virulence factors are shown. coverage refers to oversampling in sequence data. genome size was based on size of the tohama i genome corrected for the large regions of differences. abbreviations: mb, megabases; na not available.

comparative analysis of bordetella pertussis genomes
we determined the genome sequences of the six b. pertussis strains through pyrosequencing. as this technology is known to generate errors in homopolymeric nucleotide tracts, snps and indels in these regions were filtered out. as a consequence, differences between strains in homopolymeric nucleotide tracts were not identified. however, homopolymeric nucleotide tracts have high mutation rates and may vary during subculturing of a single strain  <cit> . thus, genotypes and phenotypes controlled by homopolymeric nucleotide tracts are not stable and changes in these tracts will not represent fixed differences between strains.

we identified  <dig> snps , of which  <dig> and  <dig> were located in orfs and intergenic regions, respectively . four orfs were found to contain small insertion or deletions  ranging from eight to  <dig> bases . based on our analyses, the estimated snp density was  <dig> snp per  <dig>  bases. maharjan and coworkers used microarray-based comparative genome sequencing to detect snps in 34% of the tohama i genome  <cit> . the tohama i strain was compared to an australian isolate from  <dig> and a snp density of  <dig> snp per  <dig>  bases was found. as we included the whole genome in our comparison and used a larger number of strains, the higher snp density we found was not unexpected. snp densities in other monomorphic human pathogens have been found to range from  <dig> snp per  <dig>  bases in salmonella enterica serovar typhi  <cit>  to  <dig> snp per  <dig>  bases in mycobacterium leprae  <cit> . this places b. pertussis among the most monomorphic human pathogens known. in their analyses, maharjan and coworkers identified  <dig> snps in  <dig>  genes and  <dig> snps in  <dig> intergenic regions. of these  <dig> snps,  <dig>  were also detected in one of the six dutch strains, while  <dig>  were specific for the australian strain.

in addition to the snps discussed above, we confirmed  <dig> large regions of difference  identified in previous studies using microarrays  <cit>  and whole genome sequencing  <cit> . further, we found a new polymorphism in rd <dig> .

genetic relationship based on whole genome sequencing
a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on  <dig> snps was derived . the genome sequence of b. bronchiseptica was used as outgroup to root the tree  <cit> . the tree suggested that b <dig>  which harbors the ptxp <dig> allele, represented a distinct lineage which diverged from the six other strains relatively early in the history of b. pertussis. although the tohama i strain was more closely related to the four remaining dutch strains, it also formed a distinct, relatively deep branch. this may be due to the fact that the tohama i strain has been subcultured in vitro since the 1950s resulting in a relaxation of selective forces, or it could reflect geographical isolation, as the tohama i strains was isolated in japan, while all other strains were from the netherlands. the four recently isolated dutch strains were closely related. the tree indicated that the ptxp <dig> strains comprise a monophyletic lineage which recently diverged from modern ptxp <dig> strains.

evidence for selection in cis regulatory regions
although it is often assumed that mutations located outside protein coding sequences  are neutral, such mutations can affect fitness if they are located in cis-regulatory elements . to explore the role of cis regulatory elements in adaptation, we determined the distribution of all snps in intergenic regions relative to the start codon of predicted cdss in segments of  <dig> bases . assuming random mutation , one expects a snp distribution which reflects the frequency of the  <dig> base intergenic segments in the chromosome. this frequency is highest for the proximate  <dig> base segment and decreases with distance to the start codon . the actual frequency distribution was compared with the frequency based on null hypothesis and found to be significantly different . in view of the low number of snps observed, the region  <dig> to >  <dig> will be ignored. in the regions 50- <dig> and 175- <dig> more snps were observed than in the random mutation model, suggesting diversifying selection. these regions may contain binding sites for regulatory proteins such as bvga, as shown for ptx  <cit> . the regions 125- <dig> and 0- <dig> contained less snps compared to the random model, possibly reflecting purifying selection. the region 0- <dig> contains the binding site for rna-polymerase and regions involved in initiation of translation and it seems that such regions tend to be conserved in b. pertussis. thus our results provide evidence that regions involved in binding of regulatory proteins are subject to diversifying selection suggesting a role in adaptation. the low degree of polymorphism, the limited number of strains sequenced and the absence of silent mutations in some cdss did not allow calculation of dn/ds ratios to identify purifying or diversifying selection in orfs  <cit> .

polymorphisms in pathogenicity-associated genes
the  <dig> pathogenicity-associated genes  contained  <dig> polymorphisms  distributed over  <dig> genes and three promoter regions . to the best of our knowledge,  <dig> of the polymorphisms in pathogenicity-associated genes were not described before. nineteen of the  <dig> polymorphisms were specific for the ptxp <dig> strain, again underlining the distinct nature of this strain. it was noteworthy that for ptx, prn , the type iii secretion toxin  and tracheal colonization factor , polymorphisms were found in both the protein coding sequences  <cit>  and the  promoter regions, suggesting both structural and regulatory adaptations for these virulence factors.

polymorphisms which distinguish strains isolated before and after the introduction of vaccination
the comparison of polymorphisms which distinguish strains isolated before and after the introduction of vaccination  may be useful to identify mutations which increase fitness in vaccinated populations and hence reduce vaccine efficacy. we identified  <dig> non-silent,  <dig> silent snps, three intergenic snps, one nonsense mutation and two indels which distinguished pre- and post-strains . the distribution of alleles and snps are shown in additional file  <dig> and figure  <dig>  respectively. here, only polymorphisms believed to be particularly interesting based on our current knowledge are discussed. the post-strains were distinguished by a large deletion  comprising  <dig> cdss. king et al.  <cit>  analyzed a larger number of post-strains , all of which were found to miss rd <dig>  rd <dig> contains four orfs coding for putative exported proteins and its removal may reduce the antigenic profile of b. pertussis. alternatively, the deletion of this region may be unrelated to vaccination and reflect the ongoing genome reduction  <cit> . one gene, pita coding for a putative phosphate transporter, was inactivated in post-strains by a nonsense mutation. the nonsense mutation was also observed in an australian strain  <cit> . post-strain-specific, non-silent, polymorphisms were found in two genes for exported virulence factors, prn and ptxa, in agreement with previous studies  <cit> . there is evidence that polymorphism in these two genes affects vaccine efficacy in a mouse model  <cit> . the locus for another  exported protein  also contained a non-silent polymorphism specific for post-strains. blast searches revealed 100% identity at the amino acid level between the prevaccination variant and homologues found in b. bronchiseptica and b. parapertussis, suggesting that the prevaccination strains harbor the ancestral allele. no significant similarity was found with cdss from other bacteria, suggesting a highly specific function. although the function of the protein is not known, the fact that it is exported suggests a role in host-pathogen interaction. also of interest is a snp in the promoter region for the type iii secretion toxin and chaperone genes, btea and btca respectively. for b. bronchiseptica it has been shown that btea is translocated into the host and is necessary and sufficient for rapid cytotoxicity in a wide range of mammalian cells  <cit> . the snp, which involves an a/g transition, is located in a putative tata box of btca and therefore could influence its expression. we investigated the temporal trends of the two alleles, designated allele a and allele g . allele a was found in all strains from  <dig> to  <dig> . allele g was first observed in  <dig> and gradually increased in frequency to ~90% in 2000- <dig>  the allele a was found in b. bronchiseptica suggesting that it is the ancestral type, consistent with the trend observed in the netherlands.

polymorphisms which distinguish ptxp <dig> strains
strains carrying the ptxp <dig> allele have spread worldwide and have contributed to the pertussis epidemic in the netherlands  <cit> . it seems likely that the ptxp <dig> allele confers increased fitness compared to the ptxp <dig> allele it replaced in current human populations. alternatively, it may be a marker for other selective changes in the same haplotype. to identify other genes that may have contributed to the increased fitness of the ptxp <dig> lineage, we sought polymorphisms which were unique for the ptxp <dig> lineage. we identified  <dig> polymorphisms specific for one or both ptxp <dig> strains,  <dig> non-silent snps, eight silent snps, four intergenic snps, two small indels  and one large deletion . the distribution of alleles and polymorphisms are shown in additional file  <dig> and figure  <dig>  respectively. only polymorphisms we believe to be particularly interesting based on our current knowledge are discussed. the association of the rd <dig> deletion with ptxp <dig> strains was noted before using a larger collection of strains   <cit> . one of the intergenic snps was located in the ptx promoter and defines the ptxp <dig> lineage. the remaining three intergenic snps were located proximal to the genes for glycyl trna synthetase alpha chain gene , a transporter, an integral membrane transport protein and a dihydrodipicolinate synthetase. it is not clear whether these snps affect transcription. we have shown previously that the snp in the ptx promoter region affects production of ptx, however  <cit> . two ptxp3-specific snps were in known virulence genes, fim <dig> and bsci, coding for the serotype  <dig> fimbriae and a component of the type iii secretion system, respectively  <cit> . two indels, located in bp <dig> and bp <dig>  were ptxp3-specific. bp <dig> codes for a putative exported protein which shows similarity with metal dependent phosphohydrolases and signal transduction proteins, while the bp <dig> product belongs to the family of arss transcriptional regulators. bp <dig> was a pseudogene in all strains, except the two ptxp <dig> strains in which the reading frame was restored by deletion of an eight base repeat. conversely, the reading frame of arss was intact in all strains except the two ptxp <dig> strains, due to the deletion of a  <dig> base repeat. both bp <dig> and bp <dig> are intact in b. bronchiseptica and b. parapertussis. the bp <dig> and bp <dig> genes from three ptxp <dig> strains were sequenced completely and the orfs were found to be intact and truncated, respectively. it seems likely that bp <dig> and bp <dig> are subject to phase variation, i.e. the reversible on/off switching of genes by varying dna sequence repeat units  <cit> . phase variation has been observed for a number of other b. pertussis genes  <cit> . based on the phylogenetic relationships, it seems likely that bp <dig> and bp <dig> were, respectively, reactivated and inactivated in the ptxp <dig> lineage. this qualifies these loci for further analyses as to their role in the emergence of ptxp <dig> strains.

CONCLUSIONS
we provide the first comprehensive genomic comparison of a bacterial pathogen circulating in a highly vaccinated population. in this study, we included two strains from the prevaccination era and four strains isolated ~ <dig> years later. we confirmed and extended the observation that modern b. pertussis strains differed significantly from prevaccination strains, both phylogenetically and with respect to particular alleles  <cit> . further, we identified one highly divergent, possibly ancient, b. pertussis lineage, characterized by the ptxp <dig> allele. our work confirmed that b. pertussis strains differ significantly in gene content due to gene loss, a process which may still be ongoing  <cit> . further, we found no evidence that acquisition of novel genes has played a role in adaptation, as has been suggested for b. holmesii  <cit> . in contrast, b. pertussis seems to adapt mainly by the successive accumulation of snps. our work shows that, based on snp density, b. pertussis is one of the most monomorphic human pathogens. this suggests a recent origin of this species or, more likely, a recent population bottle neck  <cit> .

our results provide evidence that regions involved in binding of regulatory proteins are subject to diversifying selection suggesting a role in adaptation. indeed, this is exemplified by the rapid emergence of ptxp <dig> strains with increased pertussis toxin production  <cit> . a number of recent studies have highlighted the importance of changes in gene regulation in adaptation of pathogens  <cit> . it is noteworthy that for a number of virulence factors , snps were found in both the protein-encoding genes and the  promoter regions, suggesting adaptation at both the structural and regulatory level for the same phenotype. of interest is a snp in the promoter region for the type iii secretion toxin  and chaperone genes . for b. bronchiseptica it has been shown that btea is necessary and sufficient for rapid cytotoxicity in a wide range of mammalian cells  <cit> . the ancestral allele was found in all strains from before  <dig>  but subsequently replaced by a novel allele which increased in frequency to ~90% in 2000- <dig>  this suggests that the novel allele may significantly affect strain fitness, although it is also possible that its increase in frequency is due to hitchhiking with other loci which affect fitness. in any case, this allele may be an important marker for successful lineages. the ptxp <dig> lineage, associated with the resurgence of pertussis in the netherlands, has emerged recently and spread worldwide  <cit> . we found that the ptxp <dig> strains comprised a young branch which diverged recently from modern ptxp <dig> strains. several alleles were identified, which were uniquely associated with the ptxp <dig> lineage and may thus have contributed to its success. two ptxp3-specific snps were in known virulence genes, fim <dig> and bsci, coding for the serotype  <dig> fimbriae and a component of the type iii toxin secretion system, respectively. we also observed both reactivation and inactivation of genes in the ptxp <dig> lineage. in conclusion, this work has identified a number of genetic loci which are associated with highly successful strains. further analyses of these loci can contribute to our understanding of the evolution of bacterial pathogens.
