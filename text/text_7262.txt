BACKGROUND
all organisms must adapt to their environments composed of biotic and abiotic factors to survive and reproduce. this requires organisms to allocate a substantial portion of their genomes to encode environment response genes that can be defined as those involved in interactions external to the organisms  <cit> . examples of environmental response genes are those involved in pathogenesis or virulence , biosynthesis of toxic compounds , and detoxification . to cope with the ever-changing environment, organisms are also required to have greater genomic plasticity in the environmental response genes so that novel adaptive genomic changes  are available for natural selection.

although there may be a few environmental stress factors such as uv radiation and mutagenic xenobiotics that can directly cause genomic changes, the majority of environmental factors act as pure selection agents rather than mutagens. therefore, the genomic plasticity necessary for coping with the ever-changing environment in these loci should arise primarily from internal spontaneous alteration events  <cit> .

there are two possible internal mutators that can cause mutational genomic changes: error-prone dna polymerase and transposable element . in normal conditions, the error rate of dna polymerase and the transpositional activity of te are relatively low. under environmental stress, both the error rate of dna polymerase and the transpositional activity of te transposition can be increased  <cit> . for example, the transpositional activity of tes in plants is relatively silent during normal development but is activated by stresses, such as wounding, pathogen attack, and cell culture  <cit> .

enhanced te transpositional activity may insert tes into any loci as long as they have the corresponding target site sequence for a given te. the retention and accumulation of te insertions, however, will likely be loci specific. in theory, nature would likely retain tes inserted into the environmental response loci and/or their flanking regions but remove tes inserted into the critical housekeeping gene loci and/or their nearby regions. environmental response genes need a greater mutation rate and genomic plasticity to cope with the ever-changing environment, whereas essential housekeeping genes require a high fidelity because of functional constrains. moreover, deleterious mutations within or around the essential genes, which are much more common than advantageous mutations, often result in catastrophic lethality. by contrast, deleterious mutations within or around the environmental response genes usually lead to reduction in fitness. such differential consequences resulting from deleterious mutations are determined by the nature of the two groups of genes as well as the presence of duplicated redundant copies of the environmental response genes in the genome  <cit> . by retention and accumulation of tes, the environmental response genes can gain te-introduced selectively advantageous variations otherwise not easily available to respond successfully to changes in environment.

several recent reports appear to support this hypothesis. wagner et al.  found that tes are often excluded from the hox genes, a family of linked transcription factors sharing a dna-binding domain and playing important roles in animal body plan development in vertebrates  <cit> . simons et al.  identified  <dig> conserved te-free regions  over  <dig> kb in length in the human and mouse genomes  <cit> . these tfr are significantly associated with genes encoding transcription factors and developmental regulators  <cit> , consistent with the notion that te insertions into essential housekeeping loci are strongly selected against. by the same token, grover et al.  showed that alu elements are more clustered in genes involved in metabolism, transport, and signalling processes  than in genes encoding information pathway components and structural proteins  <cit> . analyses of human and mouse genomes indicated that tes are significantly enriched in rapidly-evolving gene classes, such as those involved in immunity and response to external stimuli but are excluded from mrnas of highly conserved genes with basic housekeeping functions in development, transcription, replication, cell structure and metabolism  <cit> . along the same line, at least seventeen tes are associated with the rice xa <dig> gene cluster, which confers disease resistance against xanthomonas oryzae  <cit> . in the common morning glory , a remarkable variety of mobile elements reside in the chalcone synthase d locus , which encodes a key enzyme controlling the first committed step in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway producing a wide range of compounds important in uv protection and defense against plant disease and herbivores  <cit> . other than the above-mentioned differential retention of tes between essential housekeeping genes and environmental response genes, tos <dig> retrotransposon prefers to insert into disease/defense-related and signal transduction  genes in the rice genome  <cit> .

cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases  are ubiquitous in virtually all living organisms and constitute a multigene family replete with gene duplication and conversion events  <cit> . multiple p <dig> genes exist in a given genome, some of which may function as essential housekeeping genes involved in the biosynthesis of hormones  <cit> ; others may act as environmental response genes involved in the biosynthesis of toxic compounds for plant defense or pathogens attack or in the detoxification of naturally-occurring and synthetic xenobiotics  <cit> . to address the issue of whether tes mediate genomic changes in the environmental response p <dig> genes, we scanned two alleles  per each of the six xenobiotic-metabolizing helicoverpa zea p <dig> genes, cyp6b <dig>  cyp6b <dig>  cyp9a12v <dig>  cyp9a <dig>  cyp321a <dig> and cyp321a <dig>  <cit> , for the presence of te insertions by genome walking and sequence analysis. twelve novel tes, including lines , sines , mites , one full-length transib-like transposon, and one full-length tcl-like dna transpson, are identified from their introns, exons or flanking regions. we further surveyed te insertions among the xenobiotic-metabolizing and ecdysone- synthesizing p <dig> genes in drosophila melanogaster genome by in silico mapping at the flybase  <cit>  and literature search. seven out of the eight insecticide resistance responsible p450s, including cyp4e <dig>  <cit> , cyp6a <dig>  <cit> , cyp6a <dig>  <cit> , cyp6a <dig>  <cit> , cyp6g <dig>  <cit> , cyp6w <dig>  <cit> , cyp12a <dig>  <cit> , cyp12d <dig>  <cit> , are associated with a variety of tes. in contrast, tes are excluded from all of the five essential drosophila p <dig> genes  that are involved in ecdysone biosynthesis and developmental regulation  <cit> . these results indicate that tes are selectively enriched within or in close proximity to xenobiotic-metabolizing cytochrome p <dig> genes.

RESULTS
transposons within the cyp6b gene cluster
seven p <dig> genes distributed in the cyp6b, cyp4m, and cyp321a subfamilies have been cloned from h. zea  <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated that cyp321a <dig> is highly inducible by xanthotoxin  <cit>  and the four cyp6b transcripts accumulate to varying degrees in response to a range of allelochemicals naturally encountered in hostplants  as well as in response to synthetic chemicals not naturally encountered   <cit> . the cyp6b transcripts are also inducible by plant defense signalling molecules jasmonate and salicylate, allowing this species to "eavesdrop" on plant defense signals for activating detoxification systems in advance of induced biosynthesis of host plant toxins  <cit> . baculovirus-mediated expression of the cyp6b <dig> and cyp321a <dig> proteins has directly demonstrated that they are capable of metabolizing a range of allelochemicals  and insecticides   <cit> .

here we cloned the 5'-flanking sequences of the four xenobiotic-metabolizing h. zea cyp6b genes by genome walking approach  and then searched for the presence of transposon insertions by sequence analysis. we successfully recovered the genomic sequences and the 5'-flanking sequences of cyp6b <dig> and cyp6b <dig> but failed to recover the 5'-flanking sequences of cyp6b <dig> and cyp6b <dig> from our current laboratory population and from the h. zea midgut cell line rp-hzgut-aw <dig>  <cit> . it is possible that cyp6b <dig> is just an allele of cyp6b <dig> since it is essentially identical to cyp6b <dig> except for a 227-bp insertion in its intron   <cit> . re-examination of this 227-bp insertion sequence reveals that it has a 60-bp perfect terminal inverted repeats  flanked by 2-bp target site duplications , lacks coding potential and is at rich . these are the common structural characteristics of mites  <cit> , thus we designate it as hzmite <dig> .

* nd: not detected; : present; : absent

in the laboratory population and the cell line, cyp6b <dig> and cyp6b <dig> are adjacent to each other in a head-to-tail arrangement, with cyp6b <dig> located 2030-bp upstream of cyp6b <dig> . by comparing the sequence of the cyp6b8-cyp6b <dig> cluster in the laboratory colony and that in the cell line, three transposon insertions are characterized. one transposon insertion is found in the 5'-flanking promoter region of cyp6b <dig> in the midgut cell line cyp6b8-cyp6b <dig> cluster . this 3518-bp dna transposon insertion has long tirs and is flanked by 5-bp  tsds . the deduced  <dig> amino acids sequence has 34% identity with transib <dig> from drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . based on these features, it is designated as hztransib. another transposon is found in the exon <dig> of cyp6b <dig> in the midgut cell line . this 1558-bp transposon has typical features of tc <dig> family transposon, such as 27-bp perfect tirs flanked by 2-bp  tsds . its putative open reading frame  encodes  <dig> amino acids and share 23% identity with tc <dig> transposon from caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . thus it is designated as hztc <dig> 

the third one is inserted in the intergenic region of the cyp6b8-cyp6b <dig> cluster, i.e. the 5' flanking region of cyp6b <dig> or the 3'-flanking sequence of cyp6b <dig> . this insertion is present in the cyp6b8-cyp6b <dig> cluster of the laboratory population but not in the midgut cell line . this transposon is flanked by 6-bp tsds  and has an orf sharing  <dig> % amino acids identity with maui transposon, a member of cr- <dig>  family of non-ltr retrotransposons, from the pufferfish fugu rubripes  <cit> . this retrotransposon insertion also contains microsatellite  repeats at the 3' end but lacks a poly-a tail, which usually happened in the cr <dig> family of non-ltr retrotransposons  <cit> . thus, we designate it as hzcr- <dig>  amino acids sequence alignment with other cr <dig> clade retrotransposons demonstrates that hzcr <dig> is truncated at the 5' end, losing apurinic-apyrimidic endonuclease  domains and most of reverse transcriptase  subdomains. among the seven rt subdomains defined by xiong and eickbush  <cit> , only the seventh subdomain and part of the sixth subdomain are retained in the hzcr <dig> .

transposons within the introns of cyp9a12v <dig> and cyp9a14
two cdna sequences representing cyp9a <dig> and cyp9a <dig> were isolated from a pyrethroid-resistant strain of helicoverpa armigera  <cit> , the old world sibling species of h. zea. the fact that the cyp9a <dig> and cyp9a <dig> transcripts in the pyrethroid-selected resistant strain are overexpressed 433- and 59-fold in the fatbody and 19- and  <dig> -fold in the midgut, respectively, in comparison with the unselected parental strain, indicates that these two p450s are associated with pyrethroid resistance  <cit> . to examine if any transposon is inserted in the homologs of these two insecticide-metabolizing h. armigera cyp9a genes in h. zea, gene-specific primers  are designed to pcr-amply the genomic sequences of the h. zea homologs from the laboratory strain and the midgut cell line. the orthologous cyp9a genes obtained from the h. zea laboratory strain are designated as cyp9a12v <dig>  and cyp9a <dig>  . sequence comparison with the cdna sequences of the h. armigera cyp9a <dig> and cyp9a <dig> reveals that the two paralogous h. zea cyp9a genes share an identical genomic structure, each having  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns of variable sizes . their intron/exon locations and boundary sequences  are identical.

one transposon is characterized from the h. zea cyp9a12v <dig> by using blastx against a nonredundant database. this transposon insertion, present in both the laboratory strain and the midgut cell line, is 1764-bp long, flanked by 10-bp target site duplications , and inserted in the third intron of cyp9a12v <dig> . it has one orf that is orientated in an opposite direction with cyp9a12v <dig>  and encodes a reverse transcriptase with 40% amino acids sequence identity with the rte- <dig> retrotransposon in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . its 3' untranslated region is unusually short and is predominantly composed of tga trinucleotide repeats, the typical feature found in the members of the rte clade  <cit>  . the typical feature and high amino acids sequence identity it shares with the members of the rte- <dig> clade indicates that it is a rte- <dig> like non-ltr retrotransposon element and thus is designated as hzrte- <dig>  amino acids sequence alignment with several rte- <dig> retrotransposons demonstrates that hzrte- <dig> is a 5'-truncated non-ltr retrotransposon that retains most of rt domain but loses ap endo domains. among the seven rt subdomains, only subdomains 3rd-7th are retained in the hzrte- <dig> .

surprisingly, four transposons are characterized from the cyp9a <dig> locus . they are inserted into intron <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of cyp9a <dig>  respectively. the two elements inserted into intron  <dig> and  <dig> are 99% identical to each other, suggesting they are two copies of the same transposon. these two copies, however, have different tsds and are oriented opposite to each other . interestingly, this element is also inserted into the cyp321a2-cyp321a <dig> gene cluster , namely, the 3'-flanking sequence of cyp321a <dig> and the 5'-flanking sequence of cyp321a <dig> . this copy also has different tsds and is shorter in the 3' end than the two copies in the intron  <dig> and  <dig> of cyp9a14a <dig> . because this element has no sequence similarity to any previously published insertion sequence and has no features that belong to class ii or class i transposon, it is thus referred to as a te-like element. we designate this element as hzis <dig> , with hzis1- <dig>  hzis1- <dig> and hzis1- <dig> representing its insertions in the first and seventh introns of cyp9a <dig> and the cyp321a2-cyp321a <dig> cluster, respectively. the laboratory strain has all three copies, whereas the midgut cell line has hzis1- <dig> and hzis1- <dig> only .

in the eighth intron of cyp9a <dig> from the laboratory strain, two transposons are characterized, with one nested into another . blast search shows that the flanking transposon shares 96% sequence identity with the middle sequence  of the 1st intron of the h. zea acyl-coa desaturase gene    <cit> . in addition, these two sequences also share identical 12-bp tirs and identical tsds, indicating they are two copies of the same transposon . because they have the common structural characteristics of mites  <cit> , including small size, at rich , tirs and lack of coding potential, we designate them as hzmite2- <dig>  and hzmite2- <dig> , respectively. the nested transposon within hzmite2- <dig>  is 946-bp long, at rich , lacks coding potential, and is flanked by 9-bp tsds . these features suggest that it is also a mite-like element although without flanking tirs  <cit> . this nested transposon is designated as hzmite <dig>  the cyp9a <dig> allele from the midgut cell line has the flanking hzmite2- <dig> only .

transposons within the cyp321a2-cyp321a <dig> gene cluster
to examine if there are transposons around the cyp321a <dig> locus, another well-defined xenobiotic-metabolizing p <dig> in h. zea  <cit> , we cloned the 5'-flanking sequence of cyp321a <dig> from both the laboratory strain and the midgut cell line. a  <dig> -kb fragment upstream of cyp321a <dig> was obtained from the laboratory population by genome walking. from this fragment, we identified another p <dig> gene, a paralog of cyp321a <dig>  is designated as cyp321a <dig> . like the cyp6b8-cyp6b <dig> cluster, the cyp321a2-cyp321a <dig> paralogs are oriented in a head-to-tail arrangement, with cyp321a <dig> located 1467-bp upstream of cyp321a <dig> . compared with cyp321a <dig> and cyp321a <dig> alleles isolated from the midgut cells, the cyp321a <dig> allele from the laboratory population contains a 556-bp te insertion located 126-bp upstream of its heme-binding signature motif in its orf , resulting in a 3'-truncated transcript . the insertion sequence is flanked by 5-bp  tsds and ends with tetramer repeats  at its 3'end , which is a feature found in some sines such as artw and pst elements in cows  <cit>  and cr <dig> element in chickens  <cit> . the fact that it has no sequence similarity to any previously published transposable element suggests that it is a novel sine element. we therefore named it as hzsine <dig> 

in addition, there are two other transposable elements in the cyp321a2-cyp321a <dig> cluster, one located in the intergenic region, another inserted in the 5'-flanking region of cyp321a <dig> . the transposon in the intergenic region is 99% identical to hzis1- <dig> and hzis1- <dig> found in the intron  <dig> and  <dig> of cyp9a <dig>  and thus is designated as hzis1- <dig> . the transposon inserted in the 5'-flanking region of cyp321a <dig> is an extremely 5'-truncated copy of the hzrte- <dig> element found in the 3rd intron of cyp9a12v <dig> . this hzrte- <dig> copy completely loses its orf and retains only the 62-bp 3'utr and the flanking 7-bp tsd . to differentiate the two hzrte- <dig> copies, we name them as hzrte-1- <dig>  and hzrte-1- <dig> .

differential te insertions around drosophila melanogaster p <dig> genes
an extensive literature search shows that thirteen out of the  <dig> p <dig> genes in the d. melanogaster genome have been functionally defined   <cit> . eight of them, including cyp4e <dig>  <cit> , cyp6a <dig>  <cit> , cyp6a <dig>  <cit> , cyp6a <dig>  <cit> , cyp6g <dig>  <cit> , cyp6w <dig>  <cit> , cyp12a <dig>  <cit> , cyp12d <dig>  <cit> , are implicated in insecticide resistance and xenobiotic metabolism. the other five p <dig> genes  are involved in ecdysone biosynthesis and developmental regulation  <cit> . to test if transposons are more enriched in the xenobiotic-metabolizing drosophila p <dig> genes as opposed to the ecdysone-synthesizing drosophila p450s, we surveyed the insertions of te within or in close proximity to the thirteen p <dig> loci and gstd <dig>  a ddt-metabolizing gene, by in silico mapping at the flybase  <cit> . seven out of the eight insecticide resistance responsible p <dig> genes and the ddt-metabolizing gstd <dig> are associated with a variety of tes . in contrast, tes are excluded from all of the five ecdysone-synthesizing p <dig> genes .

*: transposons without a reference are found by in silico mapping at the flybase  <cit> .

discussion
all living organisms, from bacteria to fungi, plants, and animals, have a remarkable degree of genetic plasticity to coevolve with their highly variable and selective environments. plant pathogens can readily adapt to pathogen-resistant crop varieties by genomic changes at their pathogenic loci and insect pests can rapidly develop resistance to synthetic insecticides through gene amplification, overexpression, and amino acids substitutions at their detoxification loci  <cit> . it remains speculative how the genomic changes arise at the corresponding environmental response gene loci, simply by random mutation and sexual recombination, or by another internal spontaneous mutator?

overwhelming evidence suggest that tes, rather than only being "selfish junk dna" or "dna parasites", can act as internal spontaneous mutators to produce neutral, deleterious or advantageous effects to the fitness of the host organism  <cit> . we therefore hypothesize that tes may be selectively enriched in environmental response genes, but relatively excluded from essential housekeeping genes, resulting in greater genomic plasticity to the former but higher conservation to the later. indeed, data obtained from scanning the h. zea  and d. melanogaster  p <dig> genes for te insertions as well as studies on the drug-metabolizing human p <dig> cyp2d <dig>  <cit>  and the pyrethroid resistant housefly p <dig> cyp6d3-cyp6d <dig> paralogs  <cit>  support this hypothesis. in d. melanogaster, seven out of the eight insecticide resistant p450s and the ddt-metabolizing gstd <dig> are associated with a variety of tes . cyp6a <dig>  although not directly associated with a transposon, is located in the center of the drosophila cyp6a cluster, which is flanked by tes  <cit> . by contrast, all the five drosophila p450s involved in ecdysone biosynthesis and developmental regulation are free of te insertions . in the housefly musca domestica, two mariner-like elements are inserted within the cyp6d3-cyp6d <dig> cluster, with one located about 500-bp upstream of cyp6d <dig> and another located about 500-bp upstream of cyp6d <dig>  <cit> . in human, cyp2d <dig>  one of the best-known polymorphic drug-metabolizing enzymes  <cit> , is flanked by a  <dig>  kb repeat sequence  containing an alu element and a tandem 10-bp direct repeat in the wild type allele  <cit> . the remarkable degree of interindividual variability at the cyp2d <dig> locus is largely due to gene deletion and amplification of cyp2d <dig> generated through homologous unequal recombination of no-allelic cyp-rep elements  <cit> .

in the corn earworm h. zea, a polyphagous herbivore capable of eating hundreds of allelochemical-containing plants and rapidly acquiring insecticide resistance, scanning two alleles per each of the six h. zea p <dig> loci   by genome walking and sequence analyses found twelve novel tes within or in close proximity to these p <dig> genes . in other words, almost every allele of these environmental response p <dig> genes contains a te insertion. the twelve tes represent virtually almost all types of transposons, including full-length dna tansposons , mites , lines , and sines , indicating these xenobiotic-metabolizing p450s can tolerate and thus retain/accumulate all types of tes rather than one particular type of tes. it is likely that each type of tes may induce different genomic changes upon transposition and ectopic recombination. consequently, these p <dig> loci should be genomically highly variable. this is compatible with its polyphagy and rapid acquiring of insecticide resistance, two of the most important traits contributing to the tremendous success of this key agriculture pest in a wide range of agroecosystems  <cit> .

the insertion sites of the twelve tes are also variable, two in exons, six in introns, two in the 5'-flanking sequences, and two in the intergenic region of the corresponding p <dig> gene clusters . regardless of their potential effects on reshuffling genes and/or chromosomal domains  upon illegitimate recombination, these te insertions per se will likely alter the expression and function of the corresponding p <dig> in different ways. hzsine <dig>  which inserts into the coding sequence of the cyp321a <dig> in the laboratory strain of h. zea , will probably trigger the inactivation of cyp321a <dig> since no full-length transcripts are produced . the four tes that inserted into the 5'-flanking sequences or the intergenic regions of the corresponding p <dig> clusters may lead to overexpression of the corresponding p450s and enhancements in xenobiotic metabolism and resistance as in the case of the parallel insertions of accord ltr or doc non-ltr retrotransposon in the 5' regulatory region of cyp6g <dig> in d. melanogaster or d. simulans  <cit> . this possibility is further strengthened by a recent study demonstrating that insertions by various forms of a truncated on-ltr retrotransposon in the 5'-flanking sequence of cyp <dig>  lead to overexpression of cyp <dig> and sterol demethylation inhibitor fungicide resistance in the cherry leaf spot pathogen blumeriella jaapii  <cit> . in the case of the d. melanogaster cyp12a <dig>  the insertion of bari <dig> in the 3' utr results in 10-fold overexpression of cyp12a <dig> but no resistance to ddt  <cit> , indicating that ddt is not a substrate of cyp12a <dig>  given that overexpression of cyp12a <dig> confers resistance to lufenuron  <cit> , it is possible the bari <dig> insertion in the 3' utr of cyp12a <dig> will lead to resistance to lufenuron even other insecticides or plant toxins. nonetheless, te insertions in the 5' or 3' flanking regulatory region of xenobiotic-metabolizing p <dig> loci may have little or no effects on the expression of the corresponding p <dig> gene and resistance to xenobiotics, depending on if they introduce or disrupt any regulatory elements. the six tes inserted in introns could be successfully spliced out during mrna processing, and thus have no obvious effects on the function of the corresponding p <dig> gene.

alternatively, they could result in exon skipping, alternative splicing, or alternations in expression profiles if the corresponding p <dig> introns contain regulatory sequences as exemplified by the mu insertion into an intron of the knotted locus in maize  <cit> . analyses of the transcript species and expression levels of the six p <dig> genes as well as toxicity bioassay will be necessary to determine the exact effects of the twelve tes insertions on the expressions and functions of the six p450s, as well as on the fitness of this species in the presence of plant defense allelochemicals and synthetic insecticides.

CONCLUSIONS
in present study, we identified twelve novel tes in six xenobiotic-metabolizing cytochrome p <dig> loci in h.zea. the twelve tes represent virtually almost all types of transposons and their insertion sites are also variable. in drosophila, tes are enriched in xenobiotic-metabolizing cytochrome p <dig> genes, but exclude from essential cytochrome p <dig> genes that involved in the ecdysone biosynthesis pathway. these results present for the first time evidence that tes are more enriched in p <dig> genes responsible for xenobiotic metabolism as opposed to p <dig> genes involved in ecdysone biosynthesis and developmental regulation.
